Once again, it proves that King's prose is in a class that is more in line with modern literary greats like Irving than his pulp genre contemporaries. It proves that King can stamp his special brand of horror onto a wide range of genres, in this case the classic tale of outdoor survival. It also proves that, long past what many critics call his golden years, King can find new types of protagonists and backgrounds to handle expertly.<br /><br />In this case, the protagonist is Trisha, a young girl. The background is a forbidding New England wilderness that hosts a palpable aura of menace.<br /><br />The most chilling parts of this book don't revolve around the supernatural. Rather, they are the parts when Trisha starts to break down because her body has been pushed to the brink, and beyond.<br /><br />If you are a big fan of King, you're probably going to pick this up regardless. If you're nto a big fan of King, this is an excellent book to cut your teeth on, particularly if you enjoy wilderness survival-type stories. It is steeped in King's style of writing, but also rises above his more generic horror works.	2005-09-11

While his mother works in the attic on a portfolio for a potential job prospect, Henry handles the family meals and supervises his two younger siblings. As he juggles a variety of crises, he is always under threat from his odious Aunt Wilhemina, who will move in to provide help should Henry prove inept. <br /> <br />This is a decent setup, but I think that, in order to take off, the story needed to move in one of two directions. Either the drama and realism of the world of a twelve year old had to come through, or the comedy had to become so off-the-wall that it would have been funny to the reader. Unfortunately, this book takes a middle of the road approach, that timidly seeks laughs with pratfalls and garden-variety embarrassments, while also timidly addressing dramatic situations between the members of Henry's family.  <br /> <br />I can't recommend this book over the hundreds of better picks out there. It's not a bad read, but there's no compelling reason to pick it up. <br /> <br />	2005-09-11

The relationship of Irish Red to the ever-popular Big Red lets us experience Big Red all over again. <br /> <br />I do recommend this book, but not as an introduction to this author. Snow Dog or Big Red are better books to cut your teeth on; this book is a nice return to an established world. <br />	2005-09-08

This is a great story about two boys in the midst of growing up. Potok paints a realistic and touching portait of Danny and Reuven, who abandon many of their childish views by the time the last page comes around. The particulars of what is, to me two alien cultures was also interesting, but the real beat of the story is in the human relationships that it unveils. The characters are 100% believable, 100% sympathetic, and 100% compelling. That authenticity drives the story in a way that no over-the-top action stunts ever could. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to a young reader who has only found light-hearted fare interesting so far. This is a book to start broadening your tastes.  <br />	2005-09-08

There are some elements to the circumstances that limit our ability to immerse ourselves in his experience, but it stands as an interesting portrait of the US.     Brookes is at his best when he is introducing us to some random Samaritan; we meet dozens of characters and they are all interesting without embellishment. For this, I credit Brookes' ability to find the human story that makes each individual someone who merits out feelings and car. The quirky jobs, personalities, and circumstances of each teach us about the odd tapestry that makes up our country.    We also get to see some interesting places through a drifter's eyes, and Brookes displays a capacity to find the interesting details about a place and relate them to us in an entertaining manner.    That credit being given, this isn't one of my favorite books of this type, for several reasons. For one, Brookes is too self-aware to give us information about himself without it being wrapped in layers of filtration. He attempts to give us an honest picture of himself, but his overthought self-analysis just makes that impossible. And unfortunately ,he engages in self-analysis fairly often, and every time he does the book lags.    There's also the fact that Brookes embarked on this adventure specifically for the purpose of chronicling it, and this takes away from the authentic experience that Brookes is trying to have. Most hitchhikers have a purpose-- they are going somewhere, or they are running away from something, or both. They have limited resources that prevent them from taking a more conventional means of travel. They tend to lack the sophistication that Brookes does.     For Brookes, the purpose is the journey itself. At any time, he can pull the plug or access financial resources to solve an emergency. He also has colleagues, a clean rap sheet, and people skills that empower him in a way that the average drifter could only dream of. In short, Brookes is performing with a net, and it does take away from the thrill of the experience.    As a result, some of the sequences have a flavor reminiscent of a reality television show.    These critcisms aside, this is a book worth reading. It's nice to see that, once again, the idea of hitchiking as a necessarily dangerous activity has been debunked.	2005-09-08

With Desert Dog, he demonstrates that he can also bring the desperate world of the southwestern desert to life, with detailed and expert-sounding descriptions of the local flora, fauna, and other natural features.  <br /> <br />Desert Dog tells the story of a Tawny, a champion-speed greyhound who is lost alone in the desert. We get many of the staples of a Kjelgaard tale-- triumphant survival in the face of an interesting array of natural dangers, as well as the introduction of a good-hearted and land-savvy man.  <br /> <br />Tawny must reach through the layers of civility that he has been bred for, and find a capacity for survival that will match the harsh terrain.  <br /> <br />This is a great, exciting tale that is sure to keep a young adult reader on the edge of his or her seat. Adults who read it may be reminded of the lean, sparse prose of a barebones western that has been stripped of its human characters.  <br /> <br />This is a solid effort by a gifted author. Give it a try.	2005-09-07

I thought it stunk	I'm a huge Stephen King fan, and King's collaboration with Straub on \\"The Talisman\\" was so terrific that I was compelled to try Straub. At best, I hoped to find another author who could weave humanity and the creeps together with King's masterful abilities. Unfortunately, I found \\"Ghost Story\\" to be the worst case scenario-- a book that shattered my high hopes and left me grasping for explanations as to how the same mind could have produced both this and The Talisman. <br /> <br />It's too harsh to say that Straub is a bad writer. In fact, I really love some of his prose, and the descriptive phrases that he uses to scare up some shivers are top notch. <br /> <br />But Straub applies these good writing skills to a mediocre plot, positively hackneyed characters, and a story with questioanble ethics.  <br /> <br />The plot is not terrible, involving the resurfacing of a terrible evil among five childhood friends. Their struggles to stay alive and one step ahead of the monstrous demons dominate the length of the book.  <br /> <br />The pacing is pretty good, with lots of action, scary setups, and cliffhangers that compel you to read just one more chapter. <br /> <br />However, there's nothing in the books strengths that come close to making up for the outlandish, cartoonish characters; the protagonists are insufferable and, considering their \\"I-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer\\" actions, not particularly deserving of our sympathy. <br /> <br />Everything about the characters rings false for me, beginning with the over-the-top seriousness of \\"The Chowder Society\\" (where they discuss death at length, but implausibly avoid the topic of their deadly deed for decades).  <br /> <br />The ponderous and pompous Sears is particularly grating; he seems to have crawled out from a terrible episode of \\"Murder, She Wrote,\\" and sustaining him over the course of a novel pokes about a million holes into his believability. <br /> <br />The dialogue, the special reverence that the charactersaccord SO MANY things, and the motivations are all suspect. As a result, it's hard to care about what will happen to them, and that brings the whole enterprise to a groaning halt. <br /> <br />Well, this has turned into quite a little rant, but you can take that as a measure of my disappointment. It may be that Straub has struck a balance in other novels that works, but if you're a King fan looking for King-esque writing, don't turn to Ghost Story.	2005-09-07

The pages are mostly wall-to-wall illustrations with text boxes which walk readers through several basic UFO topics, including Project Blue Book and the difference between a close encounter of the first, second, and third kinds.     Despite the fact that it obviously is geared towards believers, the book remains somewhat objective in that it states repeatedly that the truth about UFOs is simply not known.    If you have a child who has expressed interest in the subject, this is a good way to indulge that interest in a healthy manner. Rather than focus on the sensationalistic and creepy details of some supposed alien encounters, this book lays out UFOlogy in a fairly scientific manner.	2005-09-07

I enjoy Kjelgaard more when he tackles other breeds (such as Snow Dog, Lion Hound, and Desert Dog), but there's no question that he brought all of his considerable writing skills to this exciting novel. <br /> <br />Fans of Kjelgaard know to expect taciturn human characters with hearts of gold, exciting encounters with local wildlife, and vivid descriptions of the natural setting. They will not be disappointed here. While the plot is pretty predictable, I think most readers will enjoy the journey.  <br /> <br />An established Kjelgaard fan will certainly want to read this book, but if you're trying this author for the first time, start with Big Red or Snow Dog.	2005-09-07

The characters are broad and somewhat unrealistic, and I don't know that Snyder has found an effective way to combine fantastic elements with a realistic world.  <br /> <br />This is a good-hearted book, and might be worth a read as an afternoon's entertainment, but it didn't hold the magic for me that it seemed to hold for other reviewers. It reminds me a little bit of the works of Ruth Chew, which all center around kinds and magical objects. <br /> <br />I would recommend Beatrice Gormley's \\"Mail Order Wings\\" above this for a book about an adolecent who takes flight. If you're looking for a good fantasy story involving children and magical adventures, I think \\"James and the Giant Peach\\" or \\"The BFG,\\" both by Roald Dahl, would be more satisfying.	2005-09-07

I don't think I'd ever read a pure Western before I picked this up, and I only got it because Carter's \\"The Education of Little Tree\\" is probably the best book I've ever read.  <br /> <br />But Josey Wales turned me on to the genre, and I now have a little collection of Western novels, although none of them capture the life of a western gunslinger as brilliantly as Josey Wales does. <br /> <br />The two novels are bound together, with a short afterword by Lawrence Clayton.  <br /> <br />Carter captures the culture of the outlaw in a way that allows us to see the context of the factors that created them. Josey Wales is, at his core, the same kind of homesteader as Pa Ingalls or the Joads family (from Little House on the Prairie and The Grapes of Wrath, respectively). But when a terrible deed brings his life down around his ears, he becomes driven by vengeance, and seeks justice against a hopelessly overwhelming enemy.  <br /> <br />We also get an intimate look at the details of rugged trail life. Even better, we get to see some of the legion factors that crafty Wales uses to his advantage in order to maintain an edge over his opponents in a gunfight. Too many authors explain their gunmen heroes as being \\"the quickest draw.\\" Wales is quick, to be sure, but he also knows enough to keep his horse fed on grain, and to engage in shootouts while the sun is at his back.  <br /> <br />Both of these novels bring the reader on a journey through the American west that feels utterly real. The characters that we meet all have a life of their own that demonstrates the diversity of people who populated the region-- it was far more than cowboys and indians, after all.  <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Westerns, I think that this has to be at the top of your list. If you're not a fan of Westerns, but just of great fiction, this is also a must-read.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-09-06

Unfortunately, this displays neither.<br /><br />I'm not here to bash Nixon politically, but I do have to say that the book comes off as extremely self-serving. Nixon's account of Nixon's life just doesn't come off as honest. I think that when he wrote it, he was still too entrenched in a persona that needed to take public opinion into account. The result is a lot of treacly, ponderous prose that comes off like the presidential equivalent of a Hallmark television special.<br /><br />The one saving grace of the book is that it gives us many little anecdotes that demonstrate the minutiae of the daily life of a President of the United States, and that is indeed interesting. But other than that, there's no reason to pick this up.	2005-09-06

In order to beef the text up to book length without getting boring, Krakauer dips into stories of others who have been caught in nightmarish survival situations, and their stories are told to great effect. <br /> <br />My only criticism is that Krakauer reveals a bit too much of his own self in the book. Personally, I was interested in McCandless, and self-oriented psychoanalysis by Krakauer is something that I could have done without.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a strong effort, and I look forward to more books by Krakauer. I'd recommend this for someone who enjoys tales of the great outdoors, but who would like to go beneath the surface of the grisly details for a more introspective approach. <br /> <br />	2005-09-06

And yet this collection of short stories has a certain charm that lies largely in its ability to summon up the ambiance of a bygone era, where ghost stories were read in a parlour on a stormy night over a steaming cup of tea.  <br /> <br />Many of the stories do have the flavor of classic storytelling around a campfire, but as a group, they seem to have been chosen more for their literary pedigrees than their pure entertainment value-- which is a bit surprising coming from Dahl, who was a master entertainer himself. <br /> <br />Before getting any further into the book, I have to mention the lengthy introduction by Dahl, which is so odd and self-indulgent that it serves as a perfect example of an author who has cowed his editors into submission. In the space of 19 pages, Dahl makes some pretty ludicrous statements: \\"...women don't seem to be able to write plays or top-rate short stories,\\" \\"[I don't believe that] any of these high-blown authors or critics [can] write a children's book,\\" and \\"Nothing I have seen that has been published since [1958] has come anywhere near the standard of the select group in this book.\\" <br /> <br />I'm an enormous fan of Dahl, but the introduction is truly bizarre. <br /> <br />While many of the stories are very dated, and some hinge on the predictable revelation that the narrator has been interacting with a ghost all along (gasp!), many of them are also pretty darn original.  <br /> <br />Dahl himself cites \\"Elias and the Draug\\" as his favorite, and I have to echo his praise, as it seems very much like a Nordic folktale made accessible to modern audiences. <br /> <br />I don't think that a reader will be particularly frightened by the stories in this book, but they are interesting and worth reading. If you're a fan of ghost stories, or are thinking of buying a ghostly anthology for the first time, this is a great buy.	2005-09-05

Dick Jordan and his daughter Pam are being held prisoner on their own ranch by some of the hired help. The villains are intent on taking over the ranch entirely, and they are using the threat of violence to gain Jordan's signature on documents that will hold up to external scrutiny once the ranch changes hands.  <br /> <br />Hopalong rides into town as a lone gunman, but he is eventually joined by a couple of old friends, as well as some locals who have been living in fear of the oppressive Avery Sparr.  <br /> <br />I did like many things about this book. The pacing and narrative are both done with the characteristic Lamour flair for mastery, and there are plenty of rootin tootin action scenes. I also appreciated some of the creative solutions that Hopalong applies to the unique situations in which he finds himself. <br /> <br />But for me, the story ultimately fell flat because I didn't feel for the characters, not even Hopalong himself. There are just too many convenient outcomes to Hopalong's risky decisions, most notably when he faces down an entire room full of outlaws whose purpose is to kill him. Things are just a little too pat for my liking. <br /> <br />If you're a Lamour fan, by all means read this as part of his canon, but if you're trying him out for the first time, you might want to start somewhere else. <br /> <br />	2005-09-04

It is repetitive, making the same jokes over and over. And the three central characters are defined by little other than a single trait apiece. <br /> <br />So why the heck are they so good? <br /> <br />The Lemony Snickett jokes are all very similar and predictable, it is true, but they are also consistently funny. There's just something about the understated tone and the Snickett poker face that compensates for any of the book's weaknesses (and even turns some of the weaknesses into strengths). <br /> <br />This first book in the series starts off with the death of the Baudelaire parents, which leaves inventive Violet, bookworm Klaus, and toothsome Sunny alone in a grim world. The children are the picture of reason and civility, but the adults around them all seem to be either monstrously incompetent, as in the case of Mr. Poe, or just plain monstrous, as in the case of distant relative Count Olaf. <br /> <br />Olaf is a cartoonish villain, but he is also pretty frightening. He makes no bones about the fact that his only interest in the three orphans stems from their enormous fortune, which Olaf hopes to lay hands on as quickly as possible. Things escalate quickly, and the orphans engage in a battle of wits with Olaf and his detestable theater troupe, culminating in a very palpable threat to infant Sunny's life.  <br /> <br />These books are a bit dark, perhaps, but they are also full of gentle humor. While the noble orphans are not expected to triumph, we get the idea that they will never come to serious harm either, even when potential salvation plans crumble into dust. The tongue-in-cheek nature of the overblown characterizations keep perceptions of the book as pure entertainment rather than a cautionary tale. <br /> <br />Parents should consider adding this to their reading list for bedtimes. The chapters are of a convenient length, and the chatty framing device of Lemony Snickett lends itself well to a storytelling atmosphere. It's also very nice to see a book that propagates reading, engineering, and vocabulary skills in a way that is simultaneously in your face and very subtle.  <br /> <br />Snickett will never win a Pulitzer, but he will win the hearts and minds of children around the world. <br /> <br />Enjoy!	2005-09-04

If that is indeed the case, The Conrete Blonde can always be looked at as classic Bosch, with the hardhitting LAPD detective showcased at the peak of his abilities. <br /> <br />As always, Connelly's writing is superb, infecting the familiar story of a tough cop in LA with a poetic flair that elevates it above the genre. While the subject matter is too lowbrow to ever merit inclusion among the great classics of literature, Connelly's language skills are on par with the finest modern literary authors. What's more, we don't sacrifice the thrills, hard-hitting action, or breakneck plot pacing for an instant. <br /> <br />In some of the Bosch novels I feel like there is a twist too many, but I found this outing to be spot on, and very satisfying. This book, and this series, is a perfect marriage of police procedural, action, and human characterization. Bosch understands and loves LA, and the way that he puts it all on the line in defense of LA citizens is truly touching at times. <br /> <br />You won't find a better crime author than Connelly, and you won't find many entries stronger than The Concrete Blonde. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-04

Kaufman is so conflicted that his private persona cannot be wrapped up into a tidy package, which makes it impossible to reduce him to a chapter-sized description.<br /><br />There are lots of contradictory opinions of the way that Kaufman viewed the world, and viewed himself. Rather than picking a majority opinion and going with it, Zehme has given us all of those fragmentary glimpses of his life, and we are left to draw the conclusion that Kaufman himself didn't really understand who he was.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever laughed at any of Kaufman's spectacular performances will enjoy this book, which does describe many of Kaufman's bits in a way that allows the reader to appreciate their humor. This is also a look into the entertainment industry from the perspective of an outsider; Kaufman was a peculiar bird in Hollywood, as he could entertain audiences, but couldn't mesh with the political machine that assigns roles to tinseltown's denizens.<br /><br />This is a good, solid biography of an interesting subject, and is worth the time it takes to read.	2005-09-04

The adult dalmatians find friends and foes along their path, and end up liberating nearly a hundred little puppies.  <br /> <br />Smith has fun with the details and logistics of feeding, disguising, and transporting the refugee puppies, and young readers will enjoy learning the particulars of the secret lives of dogs.  <br /> <br />The original animated movie adaptation is a good and fairly faithful movie in its own right, but the book is better by far.  <br /> <br />Some parents might shy away from the book because of the gruesome idea that Cruella literally skins her young charges, but I think that the darker elements are an integral part of the winning tone, which refrains from talking down to children.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended! <br /> <br />	2005-09-03

We get detailed accounts of building a house, installing a latched door to help defend against wolves and Indians, and the problems of procuring, storing, and preparing food.  <br /> <br />The details and accurate portrayal of frontier life is half of what makes this book tick. The other half is the warm and loving relationship between the Ingalls family, who cherish their little community far more than their meager possessions.  <br /> <br />We also get to see a snapshot of an evolving political landscape from the Ingalls' point of view. The wobbly US government is negotiating with the various Indian tribes in the area, and the Ingalls must live and die by the word of the law. They also have to deal with increasingly resentful and intrusive Indians, who bring a real note of menace into their lives. So many modern portayals of frontier Indians show them as saints; this is a more realistic portrayal of how Indian culture might seem menacing from the perspective of a lone family on the prairie.  <br /> <br />This is a beloved series that has withstood the test of time. While the interactions between the children and their parents can occasionally seem a bit cloying, their natural good-naturedness never comes off as preachy.  <br /> <br />Parents and children have only so much time to read books together. This book should be a priority for them all.	2005-09-03

First and foremost, the book has three *gasp* realistic siblings, who fight with each other frequently and don't have a single \\"issue\\" that is wrapped up with a Hallmark moment at the end.  <br /> <br />Another strength is the writing, particularly when the three children find themselves on the island. From the moment they see a frighteningly big snapping turtle from their raft, there is a sense of foreboding that is extremely well done for a kid's book. The reader sees menace in every detail of the island's features, ala The Blair Witch Project. I was really pleasantly surprised at how well Ormondroyd pulled this off.  <br /> <br />While the broad outlines of the plot are very obvious from very early on, the details and unexpected obstacles that the children face in the latter third of the book are satisfying.  <br /> <br />The book's biggest weakness lies in the tired and predictable plot. After a series of lengthy expository monologues by adults in the know, the mysterious goings-on become pretty obviously what they are. One nice touch is that the book ends without an overly descriptive wrap-up; a lesser author might have filled another ten pages with in-your-face resolution, but Ormondroyd knows when the narrative has lost its steam, and wisely curtails the story there. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend this book. It's not as good as \\"David and the Phoenix,\\" but there are some elements that make it worthwhile. <br />	2005-09-03

After things go wrong, Parker finds himself adrift in a small town where a stranger like himself is bound to be questioned. He's in conflict with the locals, a couple of other thieves, and a worthy opponent in the religious organization's security chief. His goal is to get the money, and get out of town.  <br /> <br />At different points of the book, Parker finds himself alone and unprotected in two different enemy camps, and his always-innovative actions have never been more fascinating. His brand of cold-blooded practicality, fueled by a mind specially trained to see all the angles, is a thrill to read about.  <br /> <br />If you haven't read a Parker novel yet, this is a good one to cut your teeth on, and if you're a fan who's deciding on your next read, prioritize Comeback. It's Stark at his best.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-03
81216:US	20422170	R18SYLMCA1FBRY	044090580X	688523836	Beyond the Chocolate War (Laurel-Leaf Books)	Books	3	8	10	N	N	Not recommended	This book brings to life a common adolescent fantasy; the idea of a secret high school organization that pulls fantastic pranks, and which is universally feared by the student body is a powerful one.  <br /> <br />There are several strong characters; a misfit new kid who practices magic, the thuggish enforcer, the diabolical mastermind, the athletic betrayer, and Obie, the closest thing the book has to a protagonist (although he is less central than a protagonist usually is).  <br /> <br />Cormier examines the ethical issues that members of the student body face from inside and outside of the Vigils. How much is enough when it comes to stunts and mean-spirited practical jokes? Where does the power of an organization lie, and why? What constitutes the balance between friendship, loyalty, and betrayal? <br /> <br />While I like the idea behind a grim and gritty look at the secret life of high school students, I can't say I enjoyed the execution at all. The book takes itself too seriously, as do the characters involved. The heavy tone would be more understandable if it was presented in the spirit of realism, but the proceedings never have that touch of believability that is needed to make fiction compelling. It comes off as a second-rate soap opera presented to the tastes of an adolescent male audience.  <br /> <br />We live in a world where many high schools have gangs, and those gangs maintain their status by perpetrating violence against those who cross some threshold of behavior. But in this world, there is a gang that rarely if ever resorts to violence, and yet which is so feared and respected that not a single student in the school will deny their fear of them. Even students from other schools know about the terrible Vigils. This is just too unbelievable a setup to be presented in such a serious manner.  <br /> <br />The interactions between the characters are rarely believable, mostly because of the extreme (and extremely simple) reactions that the characters experience. For example, Carter, a strong, athletic individual, decides to tip off the administration about an impending prank. When Archie, the cold-blooded leader of the Vigils, suspects Carter, he begins making a series of harassing phone calls. Carter finds this to be so terrifyingly traumatic that he becomes a twisting bundle of agonized nerves, and his fear ruins his life.  <br /> <br />Another problem I had is that there were just too many competing storylines, some of which failed to reach a satisfactory conclusion.  <br /> <br />I came into this book cold, and that might have been part of my problem. The Chocolate War might have established this world and these characters in such a way that the book's weaknesses could be overlooked. But this is one sequel that definitely doesn't stand alone.  <br />	2005-08-31
82993:US	20422170	R3DWSC0UXVPOIA	044095777X	106436268	Meet the Austins	Books	3	7	16	N	N	Politics and plot drag down this charming family portrait	Young Vicky Austin narrates as she and her clan try to apply their ultra-functional family dynamics to help Maggy, a girl who was spoiled rotten until her parents died in a plane crash.  <br /> <br />At first, Maggy runs right over the polite and restrained Austin family, but eventually goodness and civility seep into her, as administered by the kind and wise parents. A double crisis arises in the book's climax; while the Austin parents are at a meeting where Maggy's fate will be decided, Rob, the youngest Austin, turns up missing.  <br /> <br />There are many good elements in this book, yet I wouldn't recommend it over scores of better books. The book is, first and foremost, an idealized portrait of a strong family unit living a life in the country. Money is never an issue, as the father is a doctor, and the family's energies are devoted to becoming paragons of virtue.  <br /> <br />There are some awfully sweet moments in the book, and brash Maggy is a character who will earn both our disapproval and our sympathy. Vicky, the narrator, has feelings that are very realistic, as she struggles with problems that may seem very familiar to an adolescent reader.  <br /> <br />We get a sense of how wonderful a community a family can be, if it is isolated from the intrusion of the outside world. Family songs, group readings, piano session and other wholesome pasttimes keep the Austins together and, for the most part, happy.  <br /> <br />On balance, however, the book's strong suits are overwhelmed by contrivances and preachiness. The plot meanders; while Maggy's situation and fate are always up in the air, there is never a real sense that she will be taken from the Austins. Meanwhile, many of the episodes, such as when a reading of Charlotte's Web persuades Suzy to give up ham, simply aren't very interesting. Also, the characterization of the children is seriously flawed. While they have realistic emotions, they are supernaturally able to articulate those emotions. Their powers of self-analysis, and their ability to overcome pettiness, just doesn't ring true. <br /> <br />Another problem that I had with the book was the stealthy insertion of religious views. Early in the book, we are treated to Rob's comically cute bedtime prayers, which is fine. But the last few chapters introduce a brilliant religious grandfather who prompts a dinner discussion about how Einstein believed in God (among other religious topics). I think it's fine to portray a religious family practicing their religion, but when the text is hijacked by a very clumsy presentation of a belief system, it becomes a problem for me. <br /> <br />This is also evident in the resolution to Suzy's refusal to eat ham. John, the eldest son, presents a \\"scientific\\" argument to Suzy about why vegetarianism is wrong, and that's pretty much the end of it. The biggest points in his argument are that not eating meat is unhealthy, and that eating a pig is, ethically, no different than killing and eating a carrot. I won't go into it here, but these points are very off-base. That they are presented as fact, with no counter-argument, represents a bad job. <br /> <br />Believe it or not, I am a huge L'Engle fan, and I highly recommend her \\"Wrinkle in Time\\" series, including the religiously inclined \\"Many Waters.\\" This book, however, should be pretty far down on your list. If you would like a portrait of a wholesome, God-fearing family that is less objectionable, I would recommend the Little House on the Prairie series. <br />	2005-08-30
85466:US	20422170	R6RA43XIR392N	0553213350	212852808	To Build a Fire and Other Stories (Bantam Classics)	Books	4	24	28	N	N	London at his best and worst	The stories that have been selected for this collection show the entire range of Jack London; roughly half of the book features his trademark setting of the Klondike, while the other half showcases some of his less-well-known subjects, ranging from American cities to Pacific Asian islands.    On balance, the Klondike stories comprise the better half of the book. London is more at home in the far north, and every story shows us a new facet of the astonishing blend of cultures that must learn to cope with one another in a land that brooks no foolishness. Taken together, the stories give us an astonishingly comprehensive portrait of the region.     London's writing ages well; his cut-to-the-chase prose and fact-oriented descriptions are still riveting a hundred years after the fact. Additionally, his ear for dialogue and ability to insert philosophical musings into the story without compromising any forward motion are reminiscent of Twain.     Despite the fact that many of them end bleakly, the Klondike tales include a healthy dose of the fierce, joyful vitality that burns brightly in the chests of so many of his characters. He paints a picture of harsh men and harsh conditions, but the men are capable of great joy; the conditions great beauty.     While I enjoyed almost all of the Klondike writings, one of the great standouts was the epic \\"An Odyssey of the North,\\" which features a man from a simple northern village whose prospective bride is stolen away by a visiting ship captain. The story is complex and unfolds over decades, leading up to a climax that keeps us in suspense until the last couple of pages. The characters and images were so vivid that I could easily imagine the thirty-page tale being turned into an epic trio of movies ala \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"     Other Klondike stories that stood out include \\"The League of the Old Men,\\" \\"Love of Life,\\" and the titular \\"To Build a Fire.\\"    The second half of the book fares less well than the first. While the backdropsare interesting and varied, London never seems as at ease as he does in the far north. He relies more heavily on simple narratives that illustrates an obvious \\"point\\" or \\"message,\\" said message being telegraphed in the first couple of pages. Also, the characters often lack that spark of life that enlivened so many of the Klondike-dwellers; we are sometimes left to ask why these characters exist, and the answers are invariably depressing.     Perhaps the worst story is \\"South of the Slot,\\" which features a man whose academic interest in the working class soon leads to a secret life as a blue collar worker that he enjoys more than his real life. While the values are admirable, the story itself is repetitive and predictable, which makes for a slow read.     But even though the quality isn't consistent, there are some real brilliant gems. \\"All Gold  Canyon\\" gives us an entertaining and knowledgeable portrait of a gold prospector. \\"A Piece of Steak\\" is a heartbreaking and disturbing look at a desperate, aging boxer. \\"The Mexican\\" is another, very different, boxing story, which gives us a hero who we can't help but admire, even if we don't support his cause. And \\"Told in the Drooling Ward\\" might feature the most surprisingly likeable character London has ever created, an asylum resident who gives us a first-person account of his life.     As a reader, I strongly recommend this vibrant and engaging book. You are bound to find a story or two that speak very personally to you. Ideologically, this book shows us a marriage between rugged individualism and socialism that may give you pause.     There aren't many writers who have the entertaining storytelling capabilities of a Louis Lamour, and the academic credentials of a Melville, but London was just such a man. Enjoy!	2005-08-29

Clarke has titillated our imagination with a book that is accessible to the non-scientist yet cloaked in an air of authenticity that leads us to ask: \\"Could this really happen?\\" <br /> <br />2010 focuses mainly on the execution of a follow-up space mission designed to investigate the mysterious events that took place in 2001. There are several plotlines that hold our interest; beyond the human interactions of the Russian/American crew, there are a series of unexpected twists which, despite their dramatic nature, avoid the cheesy artificiality of a Hollywood movie plot.  <br /> <br />For one thing, China has sent a spacecraft to the same location at the same time in an apparent attempt to further nationalistic goals. For another, life is discovered within our solar system. Meanwhile, the interactions of Hal's creator, Hal's successor, and Hal are suggestive of a possible repeat of the \\"mad computer\\" plotline that was so chillingly exectured in 2001. Also, the being that once was Dave Bowman is floating around earth, and the black monolith springs into stunning action when it's least expected. In all, it's a very event-filled book.  <br /> <br />In the end, as in 2001, we are left with as many questions as answers, for that is the nature of the scientific universe that Clarke portrays.  <br /> <br />One of the things that I love about these novels is that scientists are presented as heroes, and yet they don't have to turn into musclebound ass-kickers to achieve that status. Clarke demonstrates that there is nothing more heroic, and more peculiarly human, than a battle of wits played against a vast and indecipherable universe. The human ingenuity that is brought to bear on the problems is, to me, so much more entertaining than reading about a brutish protagonist using force to blast his way through all obstacles.  <br /> <br />And Clarke also shines in his ability to realistically portray the practical workings of scientific advances that have,to date, eluded us. Human hibernation, for example, is something that scientists are currently researching enthusiastically, and is a facet of many scifi projects. But Clarke makes human hibernation seem feasible without compromising either entertainment value or authenticity.  <br /> <br />One weakness that Clarke struggles with, here as in his other books, is realistic character interaction and dialogue. To me, too many of the spoken lines sound like contrived speeches or forced witty banter that is too pat to sound real. At times, I get the feeling that Clarke's characters are articulating his own philosophies or ideas. That they do so is fine, but that they sound like they're doing it is a problem.  <br /> <br />Despite this flaw, I think that any reader would enjoy reading this great sci fi novel. It does work as a stand-alone, but reading 2001 first makes the experience much better. I recommend that you read them both.  <br />	2005-08-24

This is a powerful and moving account that dissects, piece by piece, the system which allows cancer-causing chemical agents to be released within the United States, primarily by corporations.  <br /> <br />Cancer survivor Sandra Steingraber is a poet at heart, and a scientist by trade. For me, the weakest parts of the book were the ones in which the poet takes over, speaking in deeply personal dramatic tones that, quite frankly, made me a little uncomfortable.  <br /> <br />Much more interesting is the scathing indictment of the processes by which chemicals are regulated in the United States. With impeccable logic, Steingraber frightens the bejeezus out of us by demonstrating that, when it comes to protecting the environment and public health, no one is driving the bus.  <br /> <br />The vast majority of chemicals released into the environment have not been held up to proper scrutiny. For chemicals that are suspected of causing cancer or other problems, there is an almost impossibly high burden of proof put on those who seek to have the chemicals banned.  <br /> <br />Steingraber builds the case, simultaneously removing all doubt that certain chemicals are responsible for cancer outbreaks in certain areas while showing us that the case cannot be proved to the satisfaction of the regulatory agencies (who are themselves heavily influenced by the offending companies).  <br /> <br />A detective story, an expose, and a lyrical narrative all in one, Steingraber has given concrete form to the sometimes-vague notion that Corporate America is behind many of our country's biggest threats. <br />	2005-06-02

His perspective is that of a well-educated british journalist, and this comes through with a score of literary references as well as with some self-deprecating wit.  <br /> <br />For the aspiring serious poker player, the book is interesting, but not necessarily helpful in guiding one's poker-related career goals. In fact, it's not so much a \\"How to\\" as a \\"How NOT to.\\" Over the course of a year, Holden is obviously playing well, as his various near-money finishes demonstrate. However, he also makes a series of poor decisions, and the biggest financial moments of the year are predicated on luck and fluke rather than on skill.  <br /> <br />Playing jet-lagged and inebriated, habitually turning to the blackjack tables as a way to rebuild lost funds, Holden nails huge pots when he shouldn't, as when he catches one of two sevens in the deck to take down a big score against Johnny Moss.  <br /> <br />Conversely, he is busted out of two consecutive World Series of Poker tournaments by being extremely unlucky, falling to a \\"three-outer\\" each time.  <br /> <br />The book is generally interesting and exciting to read, although I would have liked fewer digressions into the history and culture of poker, and more information on the mechanics of the solid play that gets Holden rolling on a poker cruise.  <br /> <br />This book will teach people a lot about poker, without teaching them about how to play better poker.  <br />	2005-05-31

That's because jokes are generally context-dependent, and to just have an endless barrage of printed one-lners fired at you is not a fun, or funny, experience.  <br /> <br />That being said, this is one of the worst joke books that I've ever seen. It's a compilation of two previous collections by Safire, both of which were originally published in the 60s. This leads to one big problem, which is that many of the insults have become dated beyond belief. I have a hard time believing that some of them weren't horrifically dated in the 60s. \\"When a fellow gets fresh, she counts to ten- thousand.\\" \\"He's as indolent as an old bachelor.\\" \\"He's the type who'll sell himself to the highest biddy.\\" Not only do these examples seem dated, but you'll notice that they're also lacking in cleverness, humor, and even sense. \\"He's sure to leave pussyfoot prints on the sands of time.\\" What the heck does that even mean? If it helps, it's in the chapter \\"Bamboozlers.\\" <br /> <br />Even the chapter headings speak of a bygone era. Chapter headings include Big Heads, Cream Puffs, Idlers, Playgirls, Sad Sacks, Screwballs, Sharpies, Show-oafs, Tactless Boors, Woolgatherers, and Squelches. I expect that a lot of these zingers originated in pre-WWII vaudeville acts.  <br /> <br />The sad thing is, there are some serviceable insults in here that are pretty funny. For example, \\"she's been on more laps than a napkin\\" could be funny in the proper context. If the editors had taken the time to spruce this book up, it would have been much better. In a nutshell, here are the things Safire has done wrong: <br /> <br />Every single insult has been included instead of just funny ones  <br />There are no illustrations that could have broken up the text or been humorous in and of themselves <br />None of the insults have been updated or modernized, even though it would have been simple to do so <br />None of the insults cite a source, which excludes a long list of funny insults from celebrities and historical figures <br />There seems to be a limit of about 20 words or so per insult. A variety of lengths would have have broken up the monotony and opened the door to funnier lines <br /> <br />Of course, with the advent of the internet, an insult compilation has become completely obsolete anyhow, so I encourage you to browse the web for all of your humorous insult needs.  <br />	2005-04-25

The book seems to be comprehensive, with every term you could imagine. The entries are also very clear, with succinct explanations that favor being clear over being wordy.  <br /> <br />The editor did make a couple of odd format choices, however. The font size is much larger than I'm used to seeing in a dictionary or glossary, and there are very few pictures or illustrations of any kind. I think that more pictures would have made thumbing through the guide a much more enjoyable experience, and the large font size contributes to the book's somewhat cumbersome size. I don't mind my dictionary being big; I just think it should be that size in the service of giving me as many entries as possible.  <br /> <br />Criticisms aside, this is a very useful guide, and I do recommend this or something like this for anyone with an interest in ecology.  <br />	2005-04-19

The clean prose brings us into the story with an immediacy that many more literary authors fail to achieve.     The main characters are the old, wise mountaineer Jake Kane, the young and good-hearted Johnny Torrington, and Buck, the titular Lion Hound who is raised to be of use to his human companions.     As in many Kjelgaard books, we get a vicarious thrill from watching Buck progress from puppyhood to his prime, against a backdrop of beautiful wilderness and sometimes-harsh conditions.     The three friends are plagued by a mountain lion, a formidable predator made all the more dangerous by a stint in captivity.     The plot is filled with action-packed conflicts, and interesting details about life in the outdoors. There are some life lessons in here that should be appreciated by any parent, but the book never preaches. It's simply a good, solid act of storytelling that is reminiscent of Louis Lamour for its simplicity and ability to captivate.     I recommend all of the Kjelgaard books, and that certainly includes this one. I would start with another selection (Snow Dog, Wild Trek, and Big Red are some of my favorites), but there are no losers in this series. Enjoy!	2005-04-19

Most editors who chose the last story, \\"The Final Problem,\\" would have also included the very first story, but this editor didn't. It's hard to argue with \\"A Scandal in Bohemia;\\" I think any Holmesophile would include that, but other selections are not the ones you would expect.  <br /> <br />As a whole, this book is a great read for the casual Holmes reader. A complete collected works book is intimidating, and all of the stories start to run together. Six seems like a good number to me, and all of the tales are definitely from Doyle's better works. Also, there are a handful of illustrations in brown ink, which lend a certain atmosphere to the text that I appreciated.  <br /> <br />I recommend this to anyone who has a casual interest in Holmes; it's a great way to experience the greatest fictional detective who ever lived without over-experiencing him.  <br />	2005-04-19

The transcripts have been edited down to be more accessible to the layman, which I think is a poor compromise between authenticity and accessibility. If you're going to publish the transcripts, I think you should publish the transcripts. If you're going to make something that's accessible to the layman, I think it should be written as a narrative, with a healthy dose of quoted material so that the reader knows that the truth is being printed. This compromise is authentic enough, but not entertaining enough for any reader who's not passionate about the subject matter. <br /> <br />But even though this isn't the most flowing read in the world, it's still an important document, and I'm glad that it's out there to be referenced. Anyone involved with the prosecution would have to be ashamed by this public record of their actions.  <br />	2005-04-17
274017:US	20422170	R1T519PCI9MLF2	0553580221	284106836	False Memory	Books	3	2	2	N	N	For what it's worth, this is typical Koontz	This is an average Dean Koontz book, which displays both his strengths and his weaknesses in all their glory.    His strengths have made him famous. He has a real feel for pacing, ending each bite-sized chapter with a paragraph that demands that we start the next chapter immediately. He has taken a clever idea, in this case irrational mental illnesses striking ordinary people, and given it royal treatment. And his descriptions of place, time, and setting are all very authentic.     On the other hand, people often don't seem to notice his weaknesses, which really bother me. His characters are very wooden, and are often interchangeable from one novel to the next. Martie and Dustin are extremely good-hearted, live a comfortable life, and, other than their new mental conditions, seem to be as functional as people can get. This Barbie-and-Ken perfection can be found in most Koontz novels. Either that, or we get \\"Barbie minus one,\\" which is a Barbie-perfect character who is saddled with a single bad character trait in a clumsy effort to add depth. Oh, and also, we get the younger mentally handicapped boy character, and the uncannily smart canine character that we see in other Koontz tales. The character problem is exacerbated by Koontz's second weakness, which is dialogue. To me, the verbal sparring of Koontz characters sounds like it was transplanted from a 1970s sitcom, in that it's neither funny nor realistic. Finally, Koontz is a little verbose at times, and I wish that this novel had an abridged version, because I think it could definitely have been tightened up without lessening our enjoyment.     But don't get me wrong. This is a decent book with some interesting ideas in it, and an avid Koontz fan in particular will enjoy his ability to keep the pages turning.     I do recommend this book to those who have already experienced Koontz. But if you're new to this author, pick up Odd Thomas or Intensity. Those are probably his best two books, and in general, his writing has improved with age, so the more recent the book, the better the chance it will be good.	2005-04-17

Unlike his peers, however, Vince also has to deal with a range of ethical questions related to the criminal activity of his family. He doesn't want to partake in the ill-gotten gains of his family, but everything he wears, eats, and drives is tainted with mob-money.  <br /> <br />Things get sticky when Vince finds out that the girl he's dating is the daughter of the FBI agent assigned to build a case against his father. To make matters worse, Vince decides to take a hand in his father's activities. In an attempt to prevent violence, Vince takes responsibility for some of the debts owed to his father by some lowlife thugs, but that puts him in the position of trying to collect money himself.  <br /> <br />This is the first Korman book that I've read for about ten years or so, and I have to admit I was a little disappointed when I measure this up against some of his early works, such as \\"No Coins Please\\" and the Bruno and Boots series. Maybe it's just me, but some of the jokes, especially the thick-as-flies mob references, seemed a little over the top.  <br /> <br />However, Korman has matured in several ways, and I appreciated that he was able to give a lot of competing plot lines their due space. The only exception to this was a storyline involving an FBI insider somewhere in the ranks of the Mob. This was barely mentioned early, but became the biggest climax at the end.  <br /> <br />Korman's writing is always good for a couple of chuckles, and you know that he's not going to get preachy about social issues or anything like that. More than any other author, he reminds me ofRobert Asprin, who has a similar sense of humor and a similar knack for showing that people, whether they're mobsters or wizards or what, are all pretty much the same inside.  <br />	2005-04-17

The book tracks the final days of Nixon's presidency, as he flits from indignation to desperation to resignation, in every sense of the word.  <br /> <br />Nixon himself is shown to be a sympathetic, if unsettlingly hapless, character whose complexity makes him impossible to read at times. As the situation builds to its inevitable conclusion, it's really fascinating to see one person after another come to the conclusion that the President of the United States must resign from his post. The last person to come to that conclusion seems to be the President himself, and his slowness to realize this is a very sad, tragic aspect of the story.  <br /> <br />Clocking in at around 500 pages, this is not a quick read, especially when you consider that the book doesn't really go into any of the events that surround the limited scope of the final days. The level of detail is sometimes fascinating, but sometimes pretty boring. I know that there's a great deal of historical value to be had in publishing this detailed document, but I wish that there had been a shorter version for the laymen like me. I want that intimate look into the White House without needing to hear details about each and every meeting and conversation that took place there.  <br /> <br />That being said, you don't have to be a Nixon buff or a political buff to enjoy this book. You just have to care about your citizenry to appreciate the sometimes-arbitrary, and very human, decisions that take place in the highest office of the land.  <br />	2005-04-16

While browsing through this book is good for a chuckle, I think you could probably get the same exact chuckle by browsing through the internet for similar subject matter. <br /> <br />Even though this is a light-hearted book that is more concerned with entertaining the reader than making a statement, I still couldn't help but be bothered by the politics of the authors, and even more so by the brashness with which they assert those politics. <br /> <br />The introduction relates an anecdote about the authors trying to get the members of a police station to work with them. They explain to the police chief that they think that criminals are glorified in shows like COPS. I had to reread this to make sure I had understood it correctly. COPS glamorizes criminals?  In my experience, COPS usually makes criminals look subhuman. Anyhow, the police chief agrees to work with the authors on the condition that they make the criminals look like \\"coldhearted dumbasses,\\" and show the police force as being \\"professional at all times.\\" I was shocked to hear that the authors were basically agreeing to cover up any professional misconduct they encountered, and to make the criminals look as bad as possible. And they were bragging about this bargain in the introduction!  <br /> <br />Looked at in this light, some of the stories seem a little sinister. The last one in the book tells about an escaped convict who was attempting to hide from a search party. The convict mistakenly thinks he is backing into a hog-shed, when in reality he is backing through a single wall, and the surrounding policemen come up on his rearend poking into the air, with the convict apparently thinking he is hidden from view. There's a quote from a cop that says they \\"didn't know whether to turn the dogs loose on him, read him his rights, or just give him a good swift kick.\\" Supposedly, they read him his rights, but given the deal that the authors made in the beginning, why should the reader assume that the man wasn't subjected to either of the other two (highly illegal) options? <br /> <br />This is just one of many examples of the \\"punchline\\" being that an apprehended suspect gets physically hurt in some way. In one case, after a man (nonviolent offender) is taken into custody and handcuffed, a couple of dogs attack him, biting him several times before the arresting officer could drive the dogs off. The authors write that this is a stellar example of taking a bite out of crime. Har he har har! <br /> <br />Joking about physically abusing a prisoner just isn't that funny to me, and it would be even less funny to the people who are facing long jail terms as a result of their crimes. Just because a person has been convicted of a crime and is paying the price doesn't mean that they deserve our ridicule, especially not mean-spirited ridicule that is specifically designed to make them look like coldhearted dumbasses.  <br /> <br />Those political objections aside, this book is somewhat amusing to flip through, but as I said, you could find the same type of material on the web for free. <br />	2005-04-16

The characters are somewhat one-dimensional; the writing is clean but undistinguished, and the plot is exactly what you would expect: girl gets roped into summer camp, arrives with trepidation, faces obstacles, and manages to fit in.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has or is planning to have some summer camp experience, because it does give you some idea of what to expect.  <br /> <br />The letters that Abby writes from camp to her best friend Merle and her parents are also pretty funny.	2005-04-16

Of course not. The Talisman was something new, and it banked on King's amazing ability to write a realistic child character, and it was an epic stand-alone borne on the wings of a first-time collaboration.  <br /> <br />In Black House, the writing is even better than in the Talisman, but the story itself is bound to lack the zing that a brilliant fresh concept comes with.  <br /> <br />That being said, this book has another element working for it, one that is unique to King's canon. It operates on a measure of sweet nostalgia. This is not a false nostalgia created by recounting elements in a single novel that took place long ago, but an actual nostalgia that draws on a mutual shared experience between King, Straub, and the reading audience that took place twenty years ago.  <br /> <br />Leave it to King to once again innovate a new twist on the traditional novel. The fact that a mainstream author who has achieved mammoth success within the system is nevertheless always looking for ways to transform that system never ceases to amaze me.  <br /> <br />Black House is a great book by the standards of the modern thriller. At times, it seems like King and Straub are trying to one-up each other, by presenting a particularly creative bit of prose or a very memorable description. As readers, we only benefit from their determination to strive for excellence.  <br /> <br />No one is going to top their list of favorite King books with Black House, but it is a great book nonetheless, and well worth the time it takes to read it.  <br />	2005-04-15

Another downside is that the calls for action become dated very quickly, rendering many of them irrelevant.  <br /> <br />Personally, I prefer when an environmental book focuses on the science of environmentalism, and I get a little uneasy when the spiritual aspect of environmentalism takes a front seat. I understand that an emotional connection to nature is going to be the best way for some people to get motivated, but I would prefer to keep all of the arguments based on logic. When a book is recommending learning Feng Shui as a compenent of environmentalism, that book loses points in my view.  <br />	2005-04-15

His amazing feel for the lives and dialogue of the Scottish farmers who he services gives each and every story a score of interesting details and conversation that is captivating for its novelty and authenticity.<br /><br />In this first book of the series, Herriot has more to say than at any other point in his career. Not that his brand of storytelling ever gets old, but here there is the added excitement of reading his first stories, for the first time.<br /><br />Another major draw for these stories is the look inside the nuts and bolts of veterinary practice, at a time when science was still struggling to overtake centuries of medieval techniques. Reading about sutures and powders and presentations is more fascinating than I ever would have thought possible.<br /><br />The character of Herriot himself is unflaggingly goodhearted, and yet utterly realistic; we see in him the best part of ourselves, and this too makes the stories a joy to read.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading this series chronologically, so that you can join Herriot as he moves from young apprentice to old master.<br /><br />I wish there were a hundred books in this series, but at the same time I'm thrilled that there's even one book out there that acts as such a standard-bearer for excellence in storytelling.	2005-04-15

The casual reader who is interested in the flag doesnt' want to read solely about a single controversy, no matter how huge it was. An author who was in tune with the public's interest would have been better served telling the story of the American flag, and the 1989 debate would have been a single, albeit important, episode in the flag's history.  <br /> <br />Despite this criticism, if you are indeed interested in the specific issue of flag desecration, this is very well-researched tome that has spared no effort to document the complete picture.  <br />	2005-04-14

But I never really gave it much thought; it seemed to me as if liberals were simply making a connection between two left wing issues out of convenience. <br /> <br />Now I know better. <br /> <br />Athanasiou has made a persuasive and detailed argument that poverty and pollution are one and the same problem; anyone who cares about the have-nots must care about the earth, and anyone who cares about the environment must see the huge role that social inequity plays in destroying the earth.  <br /> <br />With access to better food, better water, better air, and better health care, the rich can avoid to be cavalier about the environmental woes that threaten those who are less fortunate. I've always derived a bit of comfort from the idea that environmental devastation is an equalizer that is insensitive to wealth and race; unfortunately, that's not quite true.  <br /> <br />If the ravaging of the earth results in truly catastrophic events, everyone will be affected severely. But for the very long, intermediate stage between that scenario and the world in which we currently live, this is a divided planet, and the division is ugly.  <br /> <br />Personally, I'm much more interested in the environment than social issues, and I wasn't completely convinced that the correct remedies to the earth's ills would be the sweeping global economic reform that the book seems to recommend.  <br /> <br />Despite this, I think this book is an invaluable addition to the canon of environmental books; if nothing else, it demonstrates the very real connection between the plight of the world's poor, and the plight of Mother Earth, giving us all twice as many reasons to help either.  <br />	2005-04-14

The book is so engrossing that I wasn't able to put it down, but when the climax happened and the denoument began, I felt a bit cheated. Unexpectedly cheated, actually, because when has King ever let us glimpse an alien world without giving us a detailed look at that world? Ok, maybe he has done that in other novels, now that I think about it, but this book leads us to ask questions about the alien world over and over again; indeed, that's the whole point of the damn book, and when we don't get the answers we're looking for, we feel a little let down. Or at least I did.  <br /> <br />Despite this weakness, King fans will be thrilled to read King's masterful, assured prose as he takes us through a world that is so vividly real that it could appear in our dreams. As usual, there are digressions and stories that stand up on their own, and which make sure that the journey is a pleasant one.  <br /> <br />One thing that bothered me slightly is that there were too many heroic characters; King is a big fan of old-school heroes who wield wisdom as naturally as an old indian chief; in this novel, I think there are a few too many chiefs and not enough indians. The fact that they engage in an immoral act towards the end of the novel doesn't give them the depth that more consistent weaknesses would have.  <br /> <br />King's ideas seem as fresh as they ever did. Every time I hear rumors that a retirement is imminent, I get temporarily worried. But then his new project always appears on the horizon. King has never published a bad book, and I doubt he ever will. I look forward to anything else he cares to make available... <br />	2005-04-14

What's this mean for the reader? It means that, in general, the stories are short, even for the genre of short stories. It means that many of them are almost like little sketches of a single, simple idea rather than well-polished texts that contain many conscious layers. It also means that many of the stories are fun and quirky.  <br /> <br />Bradbury isn't afraid to take a chance on a notion, and this bravado leads to some misses, but it also leads to some hits that you wouldn't find in a more thoughtfully-screened author's collection.  <br /> <br />Fans of Bradbury will already be prepared for his odd take on dialogue, which is sometimes realistic, but more often riddled with philosophical musings that sound like they are being performed for the sake of an audience.  <br /> <br />Another interesting feature of Bradbury is his versatility. Going into a story, we never know whether we're going to get science fiction, horror, comedy, or drama. Sometimes, when we get to the end of the story, the classification is likewise elusive. This unpredictability really gives the genre elements more of a punch when they do come up. If we were to get a shambling monster at the end of every story, it would soon lose its power to affect us. But when a monster appears only twice or so throughout the course of the entire book, we really feel the horror.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this collection, simply because the writing is unique and thought-provoking.  <br /> <br />There are 22 stories in all. The ones that I found to be good were: <br /> <br />\\"Remember Sascha,\\" a story that manages to be both creepy and heartwarming, draws a brilliant contrast between the affection that a loving couple shares, and the dialogue they maintain with their nervous unborn baby.  <br /> <br />\\"The Finnegan\\" is a great parody of an old Sherlock Holmes story, in which an old man plays detective concerning the disappearance of some young children in the woods. <br /> <br />\\"The Very Gentle Murders\\" is an amusing farce about an elderly couple that mutually decides that the only satisfying past time each spouse's attempted murder of the other.  <br /> <br />\\"The Witch Door\\" draws some parallels between a futuristic world in which political trends have continued to the point of the absurd, and the Salem Witch Trial era.  <br /> <br />\\"At the End of the Ninth Year\\" is a bizarre dialogue between a dissatisfied husband and wife, who find an unexpectedly warm and happy resolution to their problems.  <br /> <br />\\"Bug\\" is a great story about a high schooler who can dance so well that he clears the dance floor every night, but gives up dancing as he enters middle age. This might be the best story in the collection. <br /> <br />\\"Once More, Legato\\" is about a man who seems to read a symphony into the chirping of the birds outside his home.  <br /> <br />\\"Exchange\\" tells the story of a librarian who gets an after-closing visit from a man who used to visit her at the library when he was a boy. This has a great, creepy beginning that makes every turn of the page suspenseful. It is also, along with the equally good \\"Last Rites,\\" a celebration of reading and literature.  <br /> <br />\\"Free Dirt\\" is a great story about some graveyard dirt that the old graveyard owner is giving away. An innocent beginning gets more and more frightening. This is another contender for best story in the book.  <br /> <br />A final contender is \\"The Other Highway,\\" which tells the story of an American family that goes off he beaten path to discover a hidden road to small town America. This has some great quotes and images in it that touch on some of the same themes as Fahrenheit 451.  <br />	2005-04-13

Findley faces an almost-impossible task when he tries to share personal experiences as an elected official whose political career hasn't yet run its course. Knowing how down and dirty modern american politics can be, Findley must write every sentence as if its liable to be taken out of context and used to headline his opponent's next smear pamphlet. This restriction makes what could have been an honest and entertaining story an exercise in caution.  <br /> <br />Reading this will indeed give you a greatly enhanced level of understanding of Islam, which is all the more important given recent world events, but you have to be prepared to slog through some rather boring prose.  <br /> <br />I guess Findley felt a need to publish while the topical iron was hot, but I'm looking forward to reading his thoughts on the topic when he doesn't have to protect his image.  <br />	2005-04-13

Watson, Skinner, Freud, Rogers and Maslow all make appearances, as well as a host of other esteemed academics who are perhaps a bit less well known.  <br /> <br />The topics themselves are extremely interesting, but since the selections were generally written for the academic community, the texts tend to be dry. For that reason, I wouldn'' recommend this to the layman; you have to be a student of psychology in order to appreciate most of these essays.  <br /> <br />For the serious student, the selections are a perfect way to get an overall feel for the field of Psychology, and to perhaps start to gravitate towards a particular area of specialization.  <br />	2005-04-13

Anderson probably wasn't allowed to have any kind of meaningful character development, nothing can happen that has any sort of permanent effect on any of the regular X-Files characters, and you're introducing characters that every single reader has undoubtedly formed some preconceived notions about.  <br /> <br />Given these limitations, perhaps all you can do is churn out some by-the-book prose and play it safe. That's what Anderson has done here.  <br /> <br />The story itself is more like the X-Files movie, in that it takes place over a longer period of time than any given episode of the tv show, and has more plot twists and turns. It deals with a trip to central america, and the main dangers are drug smugglers and the possible existence of a strange dragon-like beast that appears in ancient Mayan mythology.  <br /> <br />I would have liked to have seen the author take greater advantage of the particualr strengths that the book format allows. More flair in the writing would have been appreciated, but this is also a chance to do whatever can be imagined; there are no restrictions of budget or location or time. Instead, this is just an extended version of the formulaic plot that the tv show has established. There's a case to solve, and Mulder and Scully set out to solve it.  <br /> <br />Before you shell out 22 bucks for this book (I have the hardcover edition), I would suggest trying some fan fiction published on the internet. You'll find a wide range of writing there, of course, but the best of that lot is better than what you'll find here.  <br />	2005-04-12

Barry's whose sarcastic and colorful brand of humor, coupled with a creative and liberal use of capital letters and punctuation and a tendency to flit from topic to topic, neatly anticipated  the internet generation by several years.  <br /> <br />Barry is funny, and I'm happy to say that his material ages very well. While he is often commenting on the story of the day, his emphasis is on the humor rather than the facts, and the humor still works (check in again in twenty years to see if that's still so).   <br /> <br />I'm not sure whether I really recommend this, because it offers nothing (beyond an introduction) original. On the one hand, a fan of Barry could scour the internet and download all of his columns to save himself the purchase price. But on the other hand, Barry would probably prefer that you generate some extra royalties by buying the book. <br />	2005-04-12

I strongly support the idea of presenting a broad range of arguments all related to one core issue, but I suppose I feel that this book didn't do a particularly good job at making that concept come to life.  <br /> <br />Some of the topics, such as \\"Frontier,\\" seem too broad to really stimulate much of a discussion, and also too rooted in history to have much of an application for opinions on modern issues. The layout and visuals are also not very well done, which will be a turnoff to the reluctant pupil.  <br /> <br />That being said, there are many topics that are extremely relevant, such as war, family values, and civil liberties; these topics are illuminated by some great thinkers, such as Benjamin Franklin, Studs Terkel, and Gloria Steinem. There is also inclusion of some texts that you wouldn't think of as being centered around history or politics, such as an excerpt from \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" <br /> <br />I haven't seen later editions, and I can only hope that they've improved upon this solid concept.  <br />	2005-04-12

He was a shameless self-promoter!<br /><br />This is a mammoth book that seeks to provide the entire story of the world's most famous inventor. Baldwin takes us from Edison's birth to his deathbed, with equal parts of attention being paid to his personal life and his professional life.<br /><br />Some people might be disappointed by the fact that Baldwin doesn't fawn over Edison the man, but I appreciated the objectivity. While Edison's famous work ethic and engineering genius earned him the mythic status that he holds in the public imagination, his home life was troubled, unsurprising for anyone who is at the top of their field. Bringing some of the less savory aspects of Edison into the light de-mythologizes him somewhat, but this is done in the service of truth, and I generally find that this makes for a better biography.<br /><br />I notice that other reviewers have criticized Baldwin's lack of science credentials, but I didn't find that to be a problem, either. Edison wasn't a scientist himself, in the sense that a nuclear physicist or a chemist is a scientist. Edison was an inventor. He made things, and the basis of his creations was generally not an abstract scientific concept that would be difficult for laymen to grasp. That being said, I do wish that there were some diagrams and sketches, which would have given us a more clear picture of the nuts and bolts of Edison's work.<br /><br />I was actually surprised to see the simplicity of most of Edison's inventions. It seemed that his real genius lay more in tinkering with an existing idea until the dream of a working practical application became reality.<br /><br />Another big surprise to me was how much of Edison's role depended on his ability to market himself. He and the media collaborated to give him an extremely high profile. While I don't want to belittle his amazing acheivements, his profile is much higher than others who, it can be argued, made equal or even greater contributions to society.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this work was that it was kind of boring. Baldwin has found some fascinating anecdotes and facts about Edison, but they are mixed in with too many dull details. The writing itself is generally quite dry, with more of a textbook atmosphere than some other successful modern nonfiction works.<br /><br />Despite this, there are some fascinating and bizarre aspects of Edison that Baldwin gives their due. For example, in Edison's old age, when his hearing went, his wife used to keep him up to date on the dinner conversation by tapping morse code onto his thigh. He also lived on almost nothing but milk and the occasional bit of bread for the last two years of his life.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book to the person who is serious about getting the real story of Thomas Edison. If you're looking for a more entertaining read, or one which treads lightly around his mythic status, go elsewhere.e I don't want to belittle his amazing acheivements, his profile is much higher than others who, it can be argued, made equal or even greater contributions to society.  <br /> <br />My biggest problem with this work was that it was kind of boring.

The writing is somewhat dated, but not nearly as much as you might expect; language is less of a barrier than it is in, for example, the Sherlock Holmes stories or Mark Twain.  <br /> <br />Wells gives us all a window into the beastliness at the root of ourselves; anyone who reads this will find lots to discuss. <br />	2005-04-09

His perfect big brother, Pete, comes out of the closet as a gay man and then reveals that he's tested HIV positive. This horrifies his straight-laced and traditional parents, who are simultaneously disturbed by their son's sexuality and horrified at the disease that he faces.  <br /> <br />In the meantime, Erick has other problems. His relationships with his girlfriend Dill and his best friend Jack are threatened when he and Jack's girlfriend, Nicki, develop romantic feelings for each other. Nicki is an strong, loner character who hides a secret vulnerability behind an aggressive brassiness and sexuality.  <br /> <br />On the one hand, this book's plot seems like an after-school special tailor-made to deal with the issues that teens face. On the other hand, M.E. Kerr brings a strong, professional touch to the writing, and the characters are deeper and more realistic than you would find in a made-for-TV deal.  <br /> <br />I think that the love triangle and the realism might make this an entertaining read that will be more digestible than a straight story about the more serious stuff would be.  <br />	2005-04-09

In fact, I would say that this is the first (although not the only) good book Koontz has ever written.  <br /> <br />The story is focused, following the story of a young woman who finds herself trapped by a murderer. The battle between the two reminds me of some way of the Stephen King masterpiece, Misery. Both involve a powerless hero struggling against a massively powerful enemy. The simplicity of the plot is refreshing to both, and most importantly, the heroes do everything they possibly can to beat the odds. How many novels are spoiled because it's obvious that the hero is passing up a big opportunity to triumph because the plot demands more adversity? In this book, there are no missed chances; only a desperate struggle for survival.  <br /> <br />If you haven't given Koontz a try, this is the place to start. And if you have tried Koontz previously and not been thrilled with the results, this book is where you should turn to give him another chance.  <br />	2005-04-09

Bryson is sure to touch on someplace you've been, or somewhere you know. Do yourself a favor and read this book.  <br />	2005-04-06

Dillon is haunted by the memory of his brother, who shot himself in front of Dillon. Jennifer is living with a child-molesting monster, and she fears that his attention will soon be transplanted from herself to her younger sister, Dawn.  <br /> <br />Parts of the book are letters that Dillon writes to his dead brother, which gives us some interesting first-person narrative, and also reminds us of the depth to which Dillon is affected by the death.  <br /> <br />Another nice thing is that both Jennifer and Dillon are hardcore student-athletes, which is a little different from the steretypical outcast who is usually featured in books for teens. This might make the book a little more attractive to the non-bookworms out there who are willing to give a serious book a shot.  <br /> <br />Overall, I recommend this book. It's thoughtful, exciting in parts, well-written, and interesting. The characters are not as in-depth as they could have been, which limits the level of emotional connection we can feel to them, but they aren't half bad, either.  <br />	2005-04-05

In short, I don't think an appreciable amount of material is going to make the casual reader laugh out loud.  <br /> <br />But for the Nixon buff, this is an interesting way to experience the Watergate scandal as it unfolds, with each detail giving the likeable Buchwald fodder for his arsenal of wit. As a satirist, of course, most of the columns are negative, so I suppose they might seem funnier to the anti-Nixon buff than the Nixon buff.  <br />	2005-04-05

The stories are very much in the tradition of short horror stories, with clean and crisp narratives, surprise twists, and sometimes-dark endings.<br /><br />Robert Bloch and Shirley Jackson make particularly good contributions, and give the book just enough of a hint of the literary as to make the collection rise slightly above its pulp roots.<br /><br />The stories themselves deal with everything from a deal with the devil to a wishing well that allows people to work dark magic upon their fellow citizens. They are, as a group, very imaginative, and the caliber of the story-telling is pretty consistently high.<br /><br />Sometimes a collection of so-called scary stories, especially when it's being targeted to younger readers, is nothing more than a quick way to make a buck by jamming the work of some company hacks between two covers.<br /><br />But this collection, taken from a variety of sources, really seems to have been thoughtfully assembled with the reader in hand.<br /><br />This series testifies to the name of Alfred Hitchcock as a hallmark of quality among horror and mystery writing.

Are we so surprised at the prevalence of plastic surgery among the stars? It also seeks to entertain us, but the jokes are lame (such as noting that Jackie Kennedy's hairstyle is as stiff as the white collar shirts she was entertaining that night, ho ho!). <br /> <br />Hype doesn't do anything overtly harmful, but I would think that someone looking for dirt could find a much more attractive package than this book. <br />	2005-04-04

Which is a ridiculous premise, of course, because if you're car has completley died from a lack of oil, pouring some more oil in isn't going to bring it back to like any more than stuffing food into the corpse of a man who has died from starvation will bring that individual back to life. But I digress. On the way back to his car with the oil, the man passes a bank and notices a couple of men engaging in armed robbery. One of the men notices him looking, and attempts to shoot him through the plate glass window (another big stretch). Thinking quickly, the hero dumps the oil onto the ground in front of the bank door, and the two men both slip in the oil and fall down. They both drop their guns. One of them is knocked unconscious, and the second one is looking into the bushes where our hero has hidden, presumably to take revenge despite the arrival of the police. Finally, the man is safely arrested, and the hero comes out of hiding.  <br /> <br />Ok, I'll assume that you can find all the plot holes yourself, and get an idea of the general level of quality that this indicates.  <br />	2005-04-04

But today, I can really appreciate the irascible Andrew Capp, for whom a beer is mother's milk, and work is poison. <br /> <br />An Englishman, Capp is a slouch whose neverending alcoholic haze is interrupted by arguments with his wife, Flo. His cheekiness and stoic cheer make him endearing, and for all his faults, we know that he never means anyone any harm.  <br /> <br />Most of the humor comes from trading sitcom-like quips with Flo, or the lengths to which Capp will go to get drunk and avoid work. His cockney slang is also charming, and adds to the entertainment value. <br /> <br />This is funny stuff, and the paperback is exactly what you would expect, a  compilation which features a strip (or one-panel joke) on every page. Interestingly, Capp looks different than he does in more modern incarnations; he's small, but not as small as he looks now, and his features are subtly different (but he still has the trademark hat pulled down to hide his eyes).  <br />	2005-04-03

There are parodies of Westerns, \\"The Caine Mutiny,\\" and the three Musketeer's among other things. Considering that the book was first published in the fifties, this stuff has aged pretty well.  <br /> <br />In general, however, I would recommend another book in the series, and that only if you're truly in love with the Mad way of life.  <br />	2005-04-02

In this particular book, a wide variety of artists have their work featured, which is a step up from the editions that feature the work of one particular artist.  <br /> <br />The most inspired of the bits features a slew of other comic characters (Donald Duck, Dagwood Bumstead, Mary Worth, etc.) lying on the couch of a psychologist and being analyzed. As the Mad books go, this is a good edition, but there's nothing here that doesn't appear in the magazine.  <br /> <br />If you're a Madaholic, you should pick this collection up for nostalgia's sake; otherwise, there's no real reason to own this book. <br />	2005-04-02

In this particular book, Don Martin has some extended sketches that parody \\"The Fly,\\" \\"King Kong,\\" and a field guide for cockroaches. However, his best work is probably the shorter bits, if only because they pack in more jokes per minute, and the jokes aren't terribly funny.  <br /> <br />Many of the comics derive their humor from a twist ending, such as the spider who builds his web only to have the last frame reveal that his support sticks are actually the fingers of a giant fly.  <br /> <br />If you're a Madaholic, you should pick this collection up for nostalgia's sake; otherwise, there's no real reason to own this book. <br />	2005-04-02

Books	3	0	0	N	N	Witty, funny, the best that Mad has to offer	Mad Magazine's Dave Berg may just be the funniest person they have ever had on staff, and this book showcases his powers of observation and commentary at their finest.  <br /> <br />The drawings are well done, with lots of use of shading to add a hint of realism to the scenery. The jokes are also very well done; most of them are based on the exposition of the neuroses and unpleasantries that make up the human personality.  <br /> <br />It's very funny to see his wry and brutally honest commentaries on American life. Whether it's the woman who uses her seatbelts to keep her groceries safe while her kids stand up in the convertible, or the sleazy punk who pretends that he's had sex wit a pretty girl in order to impress his friends, these are the people that we see around us.  <br /> <br />Berg's best-known regular feature in the magazine is \\"The Lighter Side of...\\"  That was always a favorite of mine, and this book shows why. This is as good as the series gets, and if you're going to pick one of the Mad paperbacks up, start here.  <br />	2005-04-02

By marrying folk wisdom, science, mythology and the views of practical utilitarians for whom the wolf impacts their way of life, Lopez has created a more complete picture of this wonderful species than any other that I've ever seen to this day.  <br /> <br />I felt more at home when Lopez was citing scientific biological information rather than spiritual texts, but appreciated everything. Lopez has a clean and precise writing style that will bring wolves to life. I also enjoyed the way that Lopez shines the spotlight on the ugliness of hunting wolves for sport.  <br /> <br />A great book; I recommend it for all those who appreciate the great outdoors.  <br />	2005-04-01

This series of problems and suggested solutions really comes across as a breath of fresh air, and it sadly demonstrates that many of the common-sense solutions are easy to identify and impossible to implement, even for top government officials.  <br />	2005-04-01

Actually, the alphabetical headings were somewhat confusing, consisting in their entirety of the following: Abduction, Abnormalities, Acids, Acquittals, Adolescent Gangsters, America's Lawman, American Macbeth, Amnesia Alibi, Anastasia, Angel of the Tombs, Applegate-Creighton, Arbuckle (\\"Fatty\\").  Some of these headings seem contrived or arbitrary, some are individuals, and some are groups into which these same individuals could be said to fall.  <br /> <br />The photos seem mostly taken from old newspaper accounts, and are therefore necessarily of poor quality; there are some drawings and some more modern pictures that are better.  <br /> <br />I feel like I've seen essentially this same exact material in a hundred different formats. In order to get excited about a compilation like this, I need to see something new or something excellent; this is neither.  <br /> <br />If you're a true crime nut and are familiar with the type of pulp material common in the genre, you know what to expect, and you might find a few nuggets here that are new and interesting to you.

His efforts eventually led to the founding of the Suncost Seabird Sanctuary, which has handled thousand of animals and really made an impact on the local wildlife of Florida's Gulf Coast.  <br /> <br />I'm not sure that Heath's story is presented in enough depth, or if there's enough story to justify, an actual book, but the target is younger readers, so I suppose only the basics were included to keep things more simple. <br /> <br />This is an earnest approach to educating youngsters, but I think it would have to be a rare and special child who would get the message that the author intends. There should be more detailed information about the hands-on care that the various birds receive. <br /> <br />However, the end of the book contains some valuable information about how to handle orphaned wildlife birds, and children and adults alike would be better off for having read this particular section.  <br />	2005-04-01

Ferguson has chosen his subjects well; simple mountaineers to whom the forest is a way of life, moonshiners, American Indians, and trappers are just some of the people who allow us to see the woods as something more than a pretty view from the car.  <br /> <br />The writing is strong, and the subject matter is entertaining. You don't have to be a tree hugger to enjoy this book. You just have to be open to developing a respect for the world in which we live.  <br />	2005-03-31

The charmingly antiquated prose reminds us continually of how these types of manuals have been dumbed down in the last fifty years or so, and the advice is spot-on for attracting a wide variety of bird species through food, housing, and water. The book is very slim, succinct, and to the point, without a lot of energy expended on full page illustrations or anything of the sort. With this no-frills approach, the book is a great example of how some engaging activities can resist the encroachment of consumerism; once you've spent a few dollars on materials and feed, you can attract birds as well as the billionaire next door.	2005-03-31

The unusual features, the reputation for harmlessness, and the association with Texas have all combined to give the armadillo a unique place in our consciousness.  <br /> <br />This book capitalizes on this interest by laying out an unusually broad range of basic information, ranging from the natural history of the armadillo to the Apelt Armadillo Company, which turns the little critters into baskets.  <br /> <br />The text is clear without being poetic; it is written for the layman in the same way that a textbook is. The end result is prose which is accessible, but somewhat dry at times. For the record, I'd prefer a bit dry to a botched attempt at something grander, and I didn't mind it at all.  <br /> <br />To me, the single most interesting section dealt with the critical role that armadillos play in leprosy research. Who knew? <br /> <br />If you have an interest in this critters, I recommend this book as a great way to introduce yourself to the subject.

But there is also plenty of information on the care and feeding of your bird. <br /> <br />However, I can't recommend the book because some of the information has become outdated, and also the layout throughout the book is poorly done. There is a feeling of inconsistency that is furthered by the juxtaposition of color photos with black and white, and oddly typeset blocks of text.  <br /> <br />If you're getting a parakeet for the first time, I would get a more mainstream beginner's book.  <br />	2005-03-31

First, it teaches children about the science of dolphins in an entertaining way. Second, it acts as a model of scientific texts that will help them to use more complex books as they grow more advanced.  <br /> <br />Complete with diagrams, photographs, and an index, the book takes teaching us about dolphins seriously, but the text itself remains engaging enough to keep our interest.  <br /> <br />Readers will learn everything from the evolution of dolphins to the surprising level of intelligence they have displayed. It also presents many interesting anecdotes that help to illustrate key concepts.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book as a way to inspire learning about dolphins, and about the natural world in general.  <br />	2005-03-31

Worried for the safety of the dolphins, especially the baby dolphins, the director drained out some of the water, so that Bimbo was effectively stranded. When Bimbo began making distress calls, the smaller dolphins came to him and comforted him in this hour of need. When the water level was restored, Bimbo had been cured of his bullying ways, and treated the dolphins with kindness. What a great story!  <br /> <br />Whichever story grabs your fancy the most, you will be introduced in a very engaging way to one of the most interesting species on the planet. Children will be motivated to learn more about dolphins, and possibly about the natural world in general.  <br />	2005-03-29

There are three main sections that each feature essays by various authors on a different aspect of veganism. The book starts by demonstrating the health benefits of a vegan lifestyle; it then uncovers some of the more unsavory facts about the origin of meat and dairy products, most of which involve the suffering of the production animals. The last section demonstrates why going vegan can help the environment, world hunger, and society as a whole. <br /> <br />The very fact that this book is out to persuade you makes some of the information a bit suspect; I'm not saying that it's not well-researched, but just that everything has to be taken with a grain of salt, because obviously the research cited has been culled selectively from the literature out there. A more objective approach might carry a but more weight.  <br /> <br />But this is a great book to convince fence-sitters to commit to going the extra mile, and also gives the established vegan or vegetarian a wide array of arguments and facts that will help them to articulate their position when they are discussing their lifestyle with inevitably defensive meat-eater friends.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in seeing all of the pro-vegan arguments laid out in a format that is easy to understand and to digest.  <br />	2005-03-29

The first part, which is shorter by far, contains a series of essays (including one by Thoreau), and lots of historical information which places the Appalachian Trail in its proper context of American history. The essays explore the trail from a variety of interesting perspectives.  <br /> <br />The second part, which is most of the book, is made up of writings by people who have experienced some part of the trail. Old hikers, young hikers, disabled hikers and spiritually downcast hikers are all given a voice. These writings are arranged into sections according to which state they take place in.  <br /> <br />In all, this is a valuable and interesting compilation about an amazing feature of the United States. I found that reading it from cover to cover got a little tedious at times; the stories all sort of blur together and most of the anecdotes are descriptive rather than plot-driven. However, reading a portion of the book here and there helps to keep the experience of the Appalachian trail alive in our minds.  <br /> <br />If you're considering spending some time on the trail, I would recommend reading this and also \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" by Bill Bryson. <br />	2005-03-29

Learning how to make a hamper from split oak, or skinning and cooking a squirrel may not be lessons that the average citizen needs in this modern time of plenty, but you may be inspired to try some of these projects yourself; everyone will be moved and entertained by this living bit of history.

The moral lesson and cute characters are there, but the entertainment value seems to be a bit compromised.  <br /> <br />Each page has a lot of words, and the action is pretty slow-paced. Basically, Fozzie makes plans with Kermit, but Kermit blows him off and then denies that their plans were for that day at all. This makes Fozzie angry, but he's not sure of the best way to handle this emotion. He and Kermit eventually have a resolution in the form of a discussion in which Kermit admits his mistake and their great friendship endures. This is a positive model for a realistic situation that children might face, but I think it needed more humor to lighten up the preachiness.   <br />	2005-03-29

I wish that the book took more of a stand against the capture of these beautiful animals from the wild, but sadly, it merely warns against the health threats of smuggled birds. <br /> <br />Once you're over the moral quandary of obtaining your bird in an ethical manner, the book provides all of the information you could hope for. It not only gives you the basics of feeding and housing, but also has sections on breeding your cockatoo, and on understanding your cockatoo's verbal and physical cues.  <br /> <br />The drawings are well-done, and many of the color photographs are simply gorgeous.  <br /> <br />If you're considering getting a cockatoo as a first-time owner, I urge you to read this book cover-to-cover before you commit to getting your bird, as they have long life spans and are quite high-maintenance in some ways, and you should know what you're getting yourself into. Also, please support a local breeder rather than paying for the taking of these beautiful animals from their natural habitat.  <br />	2005-03-29

It soon becomes apparent that George Stark is not willing to be shunted aside so easily, and Thad finds himself in the middle of a sinister tale himself, beginning when a corpse enters the scene with Thad's bloody fingerprints all over it.  <br /> <br />This book shares the autobiographical basis that always seems to come through whenever King takes us into the mind of a novelist. As in \\"Secret Garden, Secret Window\\" and \\"Bag of Bones,\\" questions are raised about where the inspiration for a story truly originates, and we get a realistic view into the life of a writer.  <br /> <br />Thad's splitting headaches, blackouts, and seemingly supernatural encounters with scores of birds lay the groundwork for some very original (and sick) plot turns.  <br /> <br />This won't go down as one of King's best works, but it is a great example of the type of work that he's known for. It's not an epic, or a mountain peak, but is rather the solid foundation upon which his best works rest. <br /> <br />I recommend this for any fan of horror or King who's just looking for a good, solid read. <br />	2005-03-28

Unlike other books in this series, the boy who raises Henry remains nameless, and the book is more about life from the animal's perspective, and less about the relationship between the child and the animal.  <br /> <br />Many of the pictures are cute, but, as with other books in the series, the educational value is muddied by failing to address issues related to the animal's welfare. In this case, the boy takes home a duck egg (a pretty bad idea), and uses an incubator to hatch Henry out. The boy also makes the mistakes of putting the hatchling into a wading pond before it can swim, and of using a hairdryer to dry the duck off. In the end, the duck wanders off to the pond where his egg was found, and meets up with a female duck. Presumably, Henry will return to a life in the wild. In reality, this readjustment is probably not possible. I'm not hung up on the idea of truth in children's books, but I do think that the authors should focus on positive, responsible pet ownership, particularly if they are joined by realistic photographs, giving the book more of an authentic feel. <br /> <br />Children who are exposed to this book should be taught not to bring home an egg from the wild, and also that raising a wild animal is a responsibility that doesn't end with allowing the animal to wander off into the world.  <br />	2005-03-28

I went into this book with high expectations after hearing an interview with Pollan on NPR, and my expectations were not disappointed in the least. Pollan has something to say, and has given us a unique book that makes us look at the world in a different way.  <br /> <br />The basic idea behind \\"Botany\\" is that our cultivation of various plants is not the one-sided affair that it intuitively seems. While it's true that humans use apples for their own purposes, the apple has likewise used humans to successfully reproduce around the world, far beyond it's natural habitat.  <br /> <br />Pollan takes a close look at the relationship between humans and four different plant species, each chosen because it exemplifies a distinctive type of plant. The apple represents sweetness; the tulip, beauty; marijuana represents intoxication; and the potato our desire to control the natural world.  <br /> <br />Each of these plants has a fascinating history, and anyone who reads this will be compelled to ask their friends and families things like, \\"Hey, did you know that all the red delicious apples in the world are cloned from a single apple tree? Did you know that Monsanto copyrights potatoes that they've genetically modified, and that you can't replant them without Monsanto's permission? Did you know? Did you know? Did you know?\\" <br /> <br />The strongest sections of the book are the ones dealing with apples and marijuana; the weakest is undoubtedly the section about the tulip, which dwells on a historical tulip-mania among the dutch too long for my tastes.  <br /> <br />The stories about Johnny Appleseed are thrilling, and the information about genetic modification is a little chilling. The personal marijuana stories are funny, and indeed, every section has an appropriate mix of intelligence and entertainment value to make it work. <br /> <br />One criticism I have is that the book could have used more breaking up; the four sections aren't subdivided into chapters, and this gave the impression of dragging from time to time.  <br /> <br />Overall, this was one of the best science books that I've ever read; Michael Pollan is like the Bernd Heinrich of the domestic plant world. Highly recommended.  <br />	2005-03-27

This book combines two cultural icons between its covers: the Kama Sutra, a near-mythic guide to sex, and the increasingly ubiquitous \\"Complete Idiot's Guide to...\\" series.  <br /> <br />     To see an ancient spiritual guide to sex broken down into a pop-culture format, complete with clip-art and bullet-points, is kind of odd, but this actually works surprisingly well.  <br /> <br />     By moving the Kama Sutra into the modern age, the book makes the text far more accessible, and moves the concept of the Kama Sutra from something dirty to a practical guide to enhanced sexual enjoyment.  <br /> <br />     The book features a comprehensive guide to both the male and the female body from a sexual standpoint, and of course has the famous list of positions diagrammed in all their glory. There is also lots of discussion about the spiritual component of sex, and the book serves an added function as a relationship-helper outside of the bedroom. By attuning yourself to your partner's needs, you're certain to become a better lover.  <br /> <br />     But aspiring Casanovas should beware: there's no checklist of tips that are going to make you a stud/studette. The book has all the knowledge you require to achieve that end, but you might be disappointed at how much you have to work to get there (and how common-sense much of the advice is).  <br /> <br />     If you're not a spiritual person, you can still take lots of the sensual advice to heart, and rest assured that you and your partner are going to be a lot better off in the sack if you discuss the ideas that this book presents. <br />	2005-03-27

In this particular book, there are a lot of words per page, and the story doesn't flow particularly well.  <br /> <br />While children may be charmed with the idea that a pet goat could carry them around on a wagon, the achievement of this type of goal is just tantalizingly out of reach for most children. If it's a story about a flying elephant, a child will understand that he or she can't get a pet elephant. But when you see photos of a boy and his pet goat having a grand old time, it's harder to understand why you can't have a goat, too.  <br /> <br />As is typical of the series, the story meanders without a significant plot, content to show happy little individuals scenes that demonstrate the relationship between Andy and Sam. If you're going to give this series a shot, start with another book. <br />	2005-03-27

Specifically, every time he pokes his nose out of his hiding spot, the people who live in the house throw things at him and make him feel bad about himself. He is also very lonely. When he meets Willy, a wind-up mouse owned by the daughter of the human family, he thinks he has found a friend at last. Willy and Alexander spend many nights talking about their different lives. Willy is loved by everyone in the house, although he cannot move without being wound up. When Alexander hears about a magic lizard that has the power to change him into a wind-up mouse, he thinks he is in luck. But a twist at the ending gives the reader lots to think about, in terms of being happy with the life you've got, the strings that come with dependence, and the things that we do for friendship.  <br /> <br />I loved this book because it has touching and believable characters who seem to have more depth than the average picture book characters, and because it brings magical elements into a familiar household setting in a believable way that will have toddlers on the lookout for magical lizards and talking mice.  <br /> <br />The picture are also terrific, a very distinctive style that gives the book a special atmosphere all its own.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended! <br />	2005-03-25
302119:US	20422170	R3I10C60ZU24BT	0020449313	409334755	The Yearling (50th Anniversary Edition)	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Amazing blend of drama and realism	This is a classic that is more special for the portrayal of the subsistence life of the Baxters in the wildlands of Florida in the late nineteenth century, than it is for the tear-jerking climax. <br /> <br />The Baxters consist of pre-teen Jody, his small but sturdy father, Penny, and his ample curmudgeon of a mother, mostly referred to as Ma Baxter. Jody is high on life, as his existence is filled with the wonders of nature and the love of his family. But he feels lonely, too, and when he gets the opportunity to own an orphaned fawn, it seems that his life is suddenly complete. But the long months that follow are full of excitement and drama, underlined by the constant battle against starvation that the Baxters must wage to survive.  <br /> <br />It is very exciting and satisfying to read about the life the Baxters lead, where food means life, and a good relationship with one's neighbors can spell the difference between feast and famine. The only neighbors the Baxters have in this case is the Forresters, a large family of large men that alternates between being a source of comfort and of danger. Other than the Forresters, the only human contact comes when a day is spent traveling to town. <br /> <br />The relationships between the characters in this book, presented very realistically and within the context of a whole range of moral issues, are the meat of this story. The readers join Jody in wavering between loving and hating the people around him. This is far closer than most books ever get to real life. <br /> <br />This is also a compelling coming-of-age story, in which Jody moves from boyhood to manhood. After being faced with rattlesnake attacks, devastating floods, death and hunger, he has gained the experience necessary to stomach the world as it is. This loss of childhood is strongly felt, especially when it is seen through the eyes of Penny, who has done nothing but attempt to shelter his son from the harsher side of life.  <br /> <br />The story of the yearling fawn itself is less heartbreaking because the book is so realistic. There is no one moment when a child becomes an adult, and we are led to understand that Jody has been shaped by a range of experiences, of which the yearling is only one part.  <br /> <br />The stories of outdoor living will be captivating to any nature lovers, and the tough pioneer lifestyle that makes use of everything at hand is likewise interesting. Under constant threat from bear, panther, alligator and wolf, there is an unrelenting pressure on the Baxter family, and we see which human characteristics are necessary to survive life in the wild.  <br /> <br />The writing is terrific, particularly in the areas of dialogue and describing natural settings. The plot is meandering, oftentimes throwing a curve ball when you least expect it. This, too, recreates a believable semblance of life.  <br /> <br />If you want a book with heart and a satisfying ending that has something to say about the lives we live, pick up The Yearling. You won't be disappointed.  <br />	2005-03-25

The lamb has some garden-variety misadventures around the home, such as knocking over a bucket of apples. When the lamb accidentally upends the picnic table at a children's birthday party, Emmy's father says that the time has come for him to rejoin his flock at the Wetherbee farm.  <br /> <br />This is an odd book in that it features a child giving up a beloved pet, but chooses not to dramatize that action. Emmy sheds no tears, and seems to feel no qualms about returning Timothy to the Wetherbee Farm. This may or may not be a good story for children who are placed into this unfortunate situation to hear.  <br /> <br />Given that this seems to be a wash as far as teaching children a valuable lesson, I think that the book needs to be more entertaining than it is. The pictures are, in some cases, beautiful, but I'm not sure that this will hold the attention of toddlers.  <br />	2005-03-25

A handful of the stories are real gems, but I found too many of them to be a little boring, and I'm not sure that the common thread of adventurous travel really comes through in some of the selections. <br /> <br />Highlights include two stories by the incomparable Bill Bryson, who has written several well-received books of his own, a story by editor Doug Lansky, and a bizarre story by Nigel Barley entitled \\"A Simian in the Cinema,\\" which is about exactly that.  <br /> <br />Other famous people whose writings were either less entertaining, or just didn't fit as well with the overall theme of the book, include Dave Barry, Steve Martin, P.J. O'Rourke, Margo Kaufman, Dennis Miller, and David Letterman. It should be noted that while all of these people and many more are cited on the back cover, the contribution of many of them is in the form of quotes and quips rather than actual stories. <br /> <br />As a big Bryson fan, I would say that his writings alone are worth the price of this paperback, but if you're looking for a consistent level of quality that truly represents the best in this genre, look elsewhere. <br />	2005-03-24

It covers wonders of the natural world, great human achievements, eccentric people, unsolved mysteries, outer space, and inventions that point toward the future, among other things.  <br /> <br />Each entry is very well written and succinct, and every page has some illustrations or photographs that help to bring the subject to life.  <br />	2005-03-24

The girl falls in love with the most curious of the kittens, and names him Pickle. The bulk of the book details a variety of around-the-home adventures that demonstrate Pickle's propensity for mischief.  <br /> <br />The pictures, which sometimes are presented as a sequence that tell a story of their own, are very well done this time around, and the kitten is just adorable.  <br /> <br />But I have some problems with the story line, which once again doesn't provide the audience with a very good model of pet ownership. The kitten is allowed to escape repeatedly into the outside world, with no threat of serious consequences. In the world of the book, a litter of kittens means new pets for willing homes, but in the real world, most newborn kittens are destined to be put down, as there are far more kittens than owners. The final solution to the kitten's wandering involves tying a helium balloon around his midsection so that he can be kept track of. I think any youngster who is reading this book should be made to understand that tying anything one a cat is a very bad idea.  <br /> <br />Criticisms aside, this is a gentle book that has a sweet disposition. I wouldn't buy the entire series sight unseen, but if your child enjoys one of these books, you might cnosider getting others. <br />	2005-03-24

Can a Troll kill an Orc? Can a Dragon defeat a Water Elemental? How many Goblins does it take to make a fair fight against a Pegasus? Gygax carefully considered these questions and gave us a version of familiar fantasy figures that was grounded in concrete numbers.  <br /> <br />The drawings are admittedly horrible, with many of them looking like study hall doodlings instead of the legitimate artwork that came to characterize later editions.  <br /> <br />But the value of this book can't be overrated by a would-be fantasy gamer. The encyclopedic format opened the world of fantasy gaming to a world that was vast enough to include a universe of varied creatures, but cohesive enough to be thought of as a single reality. <br />	2005-03-23

It tells the story of Tim and his newly acquired puppy, Charlie, and tracks their relationship as Charlie grows from a wiggly puppy into a full-grown dog. <br /> <br />The pictures are cute, but the story line is kind of mundane, without any fantastic elements or big adventures in the works. Still, your child might enjoy the gentle, simple story that wanders from episode to episode without a great deal of thought.  <br /> <br />I'm not sure that this has the capacity to entertain or educate a child as well as some other books out there, but it at least provides a good model for a relationship between a young boy and his dog.  <br />	2005-03-23

Buttercup wanders off one day when Sarah falls asleep in the field near their home, and gets into some trouble. Then, later in the book, Buttercup has babies of her own, and Sarah gives them away to her friends.  <br /> <br />The narrative is kind of rambling to me; there's no big plot that moves the book from beginning to end. Rather, it seems like words have been chosen to take advantage of a bunch of (admittedly very cute) pictures of bunnies. Also, since it's grounded in reality, the book lacks any whimsy or magical element to inspire wonder in a child.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, the book doesn't really do a very good job of portraying what it takes to be a good pet owner. It is true that Sarah feeds and waters her bunny every day, but other than that, there are more bad lessons than good ones about bunny ownership. Sarah receives the bunny in her Easter basket, and most animal car groups will tell you that bunny-giving around Easter-time is a big problem for the little critters. Then, Sarah falls asleep when she's supposed to be supervising Buttercup, and there aren't any consequences to this action. In real life, that would probably be the end of Buttercup, sad to say. Finally, Sarah allows Buttercup to breed and have more babies, which she gives away to all of her friends. This is another common irresponsible action that is shown to work out just fine for all involved.  <br /> <br />It's not that I think that this book is evil or is going to irredeemably corrupt the children who read it. I just think that it fails to entertain, and then it fails to educate. Great books seem to do both, but this book does neither. In the end, we're left with some cute bunny pictures and not much else.  <br />	2005-03-22

The next couple of pages take a closer look at how some of those animals live within the habitat, and then the book moves on to the next habitat.  <br /> <br />One thing that really impressed me was how realistically the animals and their homes were drawn. A child who grows up reading this book will really be able to identify many of these animals and their homes. The realism also gives you a very good idea of exactly how their homes are built and work.  <br /> <br />I'm not sure that reading this in it's entirety is going to hold the interest of a very young toddler; there are quite a few words for every page. However, even the youngest of children should enjoy being asked to find particular animals in each habitat.  <br />	2005-03-22

But make no mistake, this book is no substitute for the movie, and just doesn't work on its own. <br /> <br />The problem is that it tries to encapsulate the entire movie, which is just too much story for a picture book. The pictures are beautiful, but there is too much text per page, and the language is very straightforward, without any particular attempt to make it exciting or child-oriented. <br /> <br />Strangely, the book addresses the death of Musafa, the King, explicitly, but never comes right out to say that Scar is killed in the end, opting to note instead that \\"Simba's wretched uncle fell to the ground below. Scar's terrible rule was over.\\" <br /> <br />Disney makes many works of art that are crafted to speak to the audience. But this particular book represents all of the worst that Disney has to offer. This book has been created just to make money via brand-marketing, and little to no thought has been given to making ownership of it a pleasant experience. They know that the picture of Simba on the cover will make parents and children alike pick it up, and that's good enough for them.  <br />	2005-03-21

I think that if you were to ask the average person to start naming the smartest people in the world, you would end up with names like Einstein and Mozart, Michelangelo and Bobby Fischer. Even given that Landrum was going for people who have displayed genius in the last forty years, I'm sure that there are people who rate higher on an IQ test than the thirteen men Landrum has chosen. <br /> <br />And so, this book is much more a measure and study of what goes into business success than it is a blueprint for genius. By identifying thirteen men and thirteen characteristics that can be emulated for financial gain, Landrum is giving business advice to aspiring entrepreneurs, and I wish that the title of the book reflected that.  <br /> <br />Aside from that, I'm not sure that the book does a good job of identifying thirteen separate personality traits that drive success. For one thing, many of the traits seem to overlap or even seem somewhat synonymous. The personality traits of being competitive, driven, and passionate are extremely similar, if not identical. For another thing, all of the personality traits are described in glowing, positive terms. Where are the traits of ruthlessness, greed, and insecurity that also drive some of the market forces that drive success? <br /> <br />I'm not trying to rain on anyone's parade, and I realize that this book can serve the valuable function of inspiring those who undertake the very difficult job of being an entrepreneur. I started and ran my own business for seven years, and realize that there is some sound business advice in this book that can help someone to make their own dreams come true.  <br /> <br />But I don't want anyone to think that this book is something that it's not. It's not a book about genius, nor is it a scientifically sound piece of research. I'd recommend it to business owners or inventors, but not to those who are truly interested in the nature of the human mind.  <br />	2005-03-21

But he really wants to go home with a boy, and every time a customer enters the store, Barney eagerly questions whether this is the boy for him. One by one, all of his friends are sold to new owners, and Barney is left all alone. When a mean boy comes in and attempts to buy Barney, Barney bites him on the nose and avoids being sold. Finally, a boy who comes in is perfectly suited to Barney, and even though the boy doesn't have enough money, the friendly shopkeeper lets him have Barney.<br /><br />The most entertaining feature of this book is the recurring theme of owners coming in and choosing dogs that they resemble. It's fun to see a man in a shaggy coat walking off with a sheepdog, and a well-dressed girl choosing a poodle.<br /><br />The repetition of Barney's hopeful catch-phrase (it it MY boy?) and his resignation as he sees that the boy in question is better-suited to another dog (anyone can see THAT), combine to make Barney a very loveable and sympathetic character. Besides, he's darn cute.<br /><br />But the biting of the bad boy is a poor solution to a problem. Further, the small pet shop is portrayed as an animal-friendly, wonderful place for dogs to have fun. These are both elements that don't have much of a place in our modern world.<br /><br />While I don't suppose Barney the Beagle outshines many more modern books, there is a certain charm to this that has the quality of comfort food on a rainy day.	2005-03-21

Rubin Carter, the brash young boxer turned local cop fall-guy, has a heartbreaking story that begins the moment he is taken in for questioning in a murder that he didn't commit, and ends years later, when he is finally exonerated as an older man.     Lesra has an even more heartbreaking story; as a pre-teen, he is in a prison of his own, the prison of a miserably poor life in the ghetto that has deprived his good genes of achieving their potential.    The book tracks the arrest and imprisonment of Carter, and the story of Lesra as he is taken in by a group of Canadian liberals who wish to give him a better chance at life. To me, the story of Lesra was even more interesting than the story of Carter. The most compelling scenes in the book happen when Lesra begins to adjust to his new lifestyle, and to transform from a physically stunted, uneducated boy into a sensitive and articulate young man. It gives pause to anyone who has ever said that those who live in poor urban America just need to work a little harder if they want to get out. The book makes the argument that the environment of the ghetto is so harmful that just being born and raised there creates a version of you that is almost incapable of rising above the more obvious obstacles.     Young Lesra becomes interested in Carter after reading his book, and he and his guardians become involved in trying to achieve justice for Carter. After a long and trying bureaucratic battle, they finally help to free Rubin Carter, whose innocence could not be questioned by anyone remotely acquainted with the facts of his case.     As much as I liked the stories, the writing was not very good, and often impaired my enjoyment. The fact that the authors are Lesra's Canadian friends is treated rather awkwardly, and characterizations of all of the main characters is pretty subjective, with the kindest possible spin given to every harsh word or action.     This contributes to a feeling that the authors are not being completely honest about the story; it's not that I think they're lying, but rather that they aren't willing to evaluate everything with a critical and objective eye. In one sense, the most important sense, the idea of six comparatively wealthy do-gooders taking a boy out of the ghetto and then taking the ghetto out of the boy is noble and uplifting. But another way to look at it, as a group of meddlers playing God with a human guinea pig, is never really addressed. It kind of reminded me of My Fair Lady in some ways. It's not that I disagree with the wonderful gift that they have given to Lesra; it's just that I think there's more to the story of how they came to decide to do that particular good act.     Overall, I do recommend this book because it has a lot to say, and to prove, about race relations and injustice in America. The unveiling of the corruption of those who sought to have Carter imprisoned is absolutely and unequivocally shocking. The difficulties that the innocent Carter encounters are just disgusting; he's not an innocent man in prison seeking to establish his innocence, but rather an innocent man in prison whose innocence is well-documented, and who can't seem to get anyone to listen, despite resources and national attention well beyond what most prisoners have. Lesra is equally exemplary of another serious problem; how can we expect good citizenship from America's urban poor when their environment is so suffused with negativity and animalistic treatment, 24 hours a day and seven days a week? The pull-themselves-up-by-the-bootstraps argument never seemed so hollow.	2005-03-20

Historical figures and concepts come to life, as we get novelized scenes with Freud, Emma Goldman, Houdini, and a great many others whose names may have meant little to us before picking up this novel.  <br /> <br />The writing is very well-done, with a voice that manages to be clear and lyrical at the same time.  <br /> <br />History buffs in particular will appreciate seeing the way that this book brings so many events to life; for the casual reader, however, the staggering breadth of the plot is an obstacle to immersion in the story. There are just too many characters and subplots, at times juxtaposed in too convenient a manner, to make a story that has the dramatic power that a scaled down version might achieve.  <br /> <br />But hey, Doctorow has achieved what he set out to achieve. He clearly wanted to make a novel that was a portrait of an era, and the fact that the book still works as a novel at all is pretty amazing.  <br /> <br />If you want a great novel, I recommend that you go elsewhere. But if you want a novel that teaches you something, or if you just want to experience something that's a little different from the average work of fiction, give this a try.  <br />	2005-03-20

However, I'm not sure that there's anything intrinsically valuable about this story.  <br /> <br />But what's interesting about this edition to me is that the pictures are done by Richard Scarry, who has published a long line of terrific books under his name in the years since this came out.  <br />	2005-03-20

His characterization of the individuals that he meets are presented in a narrative style that really brings those people to life. We can understand, after reading the book, why the Chinese government has such an abominable record, and the Chinese people make a compelling argument that environmental concerns must come second to financial concerns. The fact that we can see this is a \\"long walk off a short pier\\" doesn't change the fact that China is caught between a rock and a hard place.  <br /> <br />Hertsgaard presents many human stories that are, in their way, more interesting than the environmental problems he explores. His on-the-ground visit to a polluted river, for example, is almost exactly what I would expect. The river is dirty, the water ugly. But the interpreter who accompanies him on part of his visit to China provides far more surprising, and interesting, reading.  <br /> <br />Hertsgaard also ends on a ray of hope, presenting some of the solutions that have yet to gain widespread acceptance, but which demonstrate that a sustainable future is available, should individuals and governments muster the willpower to implement it.  <br /> <br />Overall, I was impressed with the writing and the attention to detail that Hertsgaard displays. I'm not sure if every trip that he made paid off, in terms of providing insight via a ground-level look at some of these issues, but overall, he has given us all something to think about.  <br />	2005-03-20

The pacing is good, and the details of life in a Florida federal prison are particularly well-presented. The plot is also, on its surface, pretty creative, with the focus being on a scam that three former judges now in prison have worked out. Using a shady attorney as a go-between, they place ads in gay publications, establishing correspondences between in-the-closet businessmen and a fictitious attractive young man who tempts the businessmen to sexual dalliances. After a damning correspondence has been established, they drop the hammer of blackmail, extorting as much money as they possibly can from each mark. They run into trouble when one of their marks turns out to be a presidential candidate who has enough clout and resources to turn up the heat, raising the stakes and setting the stage for a climax involving many competing interests.  <br /> <br />     With all of these serviceable elements in place, the story does move along fairly quickly. But Grisham just can't seem to avoid cardboard characters and cheesy dialogue that often ends with hammy one-line zingers that just don't deserve the emphasis they are given.  <br /> <br />     If you're an established Grisham fan, you'll probably like this book as much as any of his other work. But if you're not, I would try \\"A Time to Kill,\\" or, better yet, another author.  <br />	2005-03-19

The pictures are soft and full of atmosphere, often creating a sense of foreboding to be dispelled. The stories themselves are real crackers, generally eschewing a hard moral in favor of playful silliness.  <br /> <br />For example, in one story Owl is saddened at the thought of Winter, rattling around outside in the cold, and so he opens his door to invite Winter in. But Winter proves to be a less-than-stellar houseguest, whirling about the cozy home and freezing Owl's pea-soup supper. In the end, Owl insists that Winter depart, and sits down to wait for his soup to melt by the fire.  <br /> <br />Parents and children will delight in sharing this magical storybook together. The magical whimsy and gentle fun just cannot be beaten. I highly recommend it.  <br />	2005-03-19

The book starts with a situation that has become a staple, if not a stereotype, of Western drama. Big rancher Fletcher is expanding his herd, and that means that he needs to drive out a handful of homesteaders who are encroaching on his water source. The homesteaders are led in their resistance by Joe Starrett, the young narrator's strong-bodied and strong-willed father.    The disagreement has been stewing for a long time, but things come to a head after two important events occur: first, Fletcher gains a government contract that will allow him to move far more beef, making his situation a desperate one. Second, Starrett hires on Shane, a well-dressed man with a mysterious past who carries a sense of danger and sadness around him like a cloak.     Any Western fan will be able to see what's coming next. From the moment Bob (the young narrator) see him riding in from the horizon, Shane is obviously an ass-kicker and a sharpshooter.  We therefore know that he will kick some ass and shoot sharply by the end of the book, and we are not disappointed.     I actually like the plot, which is a classic confrontation between the honest and strong citizen, and the greedy and well-resourced bigwig. My problem lays more in the writing itself, which telegraphs every move long before it comes. What's worse, there is a lot of \\"telling, not showing,\\" and also a lot of time is spent dwelling on the obvious, and treating the special relationship between Starrett and Shane as though it needed constant explaining. The action was also unrealistic in parts, including a fight scene in which Starrett literally picks a struggling, hefty grown man up above his head and hurls him across the room.    The main attraction in this slim novel is the character of Shane, who can do everything twice as well as the next man. He is a man trying his best to escape his violent past by tilling the earth and spending time with good country people. But his plans are laid to waste when violence erupts around him, and we get the feeling that this has happened to him before.     This is a quick, easy read, so I wouldn't discourage anyone from picking it up and passing an afternoon with these characters. But I would keep my expectations in check, and be prepared to move on to some Louis LaMour, which is a step up.	2005-03-19
309523:US	20422170	RCM3CG3P7M3C7	0394723430	350361978	The Buffalo Creek Disaster: How the survivors of one of the worst disasters in coal-mining history brought suit against the coal company--and won	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Fair treament of a compelling and important story	This book is a firsthand account by Gerald Stern, the lawyer who represented many of the coal mining families affected by a disastrous flood that killed many of the residents of Buffalo Creek Valley, West Virginia.  <br /> <br />     Despite the fact that Stern falls into many of the pitfalls that this type of author encounter, the story itself is riveting enough to forgive the book's many flaws.  <br /> <br />     In the tradition of Erin Brockovich and A Civil Action, this book focuses on the legal battle between a profit-mongering corporation and the honest people whose lives have been threatened.  In this case, the danger manifested itself in a dramatic and explosive way, as a poorly-constructed dam gave way and a wall of water thundered throughout the valley, creating hundreds of gut-wrenching stories of families torn asunder. The dramatic power of some of the true survivor stories is just unbelievable, as in some cases men are forced to choose between holding on to a life-saving bit of wreckage, or holding on to their children.  <br /> <br />     The gross neglect that led up to the inevitable disaster is overshadowed by the scandalous legal tactics that the mining company employs in the aftermath, including seeking out survivors and getting them to sign agreements that gave them a pittance in exchange for exoneration.  <br /> <br />     Stern and a handful of survivors were able to persevere against all odds and get a mammoth settlement that certainly encouraged companies to be more careful about how callously they treat the communities that sustain them. Of course, the climactic victory is still overshadowed by the grief that the massive loss of life has created.  <br /> <br />     Stern is no great shakes as an author, but he has a compelling story to tell, and he wisely shares the stories of the survivors without editing. Drawbacks include a tendency to lionize his own image (he shares little to no negative information about himself), and a playing upof the frustration of the corporate counsel who acts  as his main opponent, a Mr. Zane. The encounters between them are recounted a bit too neatly, and a bit too smugly, for my liking.  <br /> <br />     Despite these negatives, this is an important story about a dark chapter in corporate American history. Everyone should read it to get a feel for the shocking evil that a profit-driven corporation can be capable of (in this worst-case scenario), and for the inspiration that can be gathered from a group of average citizens gathering together to demand justice.  <br />	2005-03-19

The foolhardy Pierre is not impressed in the slightest, and won't be cowed from his trademark line when the lion asks him if he would like to be eaten. After Pierre's parents return home, they figure out what happened, assault the lion, and take him to the hospital, where a chastened Pierre is extracted uninjured.  <br /> <br />Sendak is one of those authors whose work continues to shine more brightly than the hundreds of derivative picture books out there. Like Shel Silverstein and Roald Dahl, there is a hint of wickedness to his work, but it's all in good fun.  <br /> <br />This is a classic, pure and simple; a complete Sendak collection is a good idea for any child! <br />	2005-03-17

(Puffin books)	Books	4	36	37	N	N	Great for kids who are too old for kids books	Henry Reed is an unforgettable character, a strange mix of can-do entrepreneurialism and good-hearted goofiness who would make any parent proud.  <br /> <br />This is the first book in a terrific series, and is a perfect transitional novel from children's reading to more adult fare. At 239 pages, it weighs in as a longer book than most readers will have tackled to date, and the writing is slightly more sophisticated than you would see in a Hardy Boys or early Judy Blume book, for example. I would compare it to the series \\"The Mad Scientists Club,\\" which has the same type of humor and level of sophistication. <br /> <br />As for the story, it is presented as Henry's journal entries over the course of a summer that he spends with his uncle and aunt. He comes up with schemes that young teens will find exhilarating, because they are just wild enough to be exciting, and yet just realistic enough to be believed and emulated. Some of the plans are purely to make money-such as his attempts to find valuable truffles in the neighborhood. Some of them are research, as when he sends a large balloon up into the air bearing a pigeon to measure weather conditions. All of them are humorous and fun to read about, as he often bites off more than he can chew.  <br /> <br />This is a terrific series that will not only entertain, but also inspire children to think about their own start-up businesses and scientific research. I highly recommend it.  <br />	2005-03-17

Harold is a toddler who can make real objects by drawing them with his purple crayon. This simple device is the springboard for a series of adventures that will captivate and charm reader and listener alike.     For example, when he is trying to find his way back home, he draws a policeman so that he can ask for directions. But the policeman just points in the direction that Harold was going anyway, so he walks on, trying to figure a way home.     Harold's drawings are all childlike, but other than Harold himself, there are no other more realistic pictures to measure them against. Harold himself never speaks, so the text is all provided by simple narration.     Fifty years after it was first published, this book is still delighting parents and children; it's difficult to put your finger on exactly what makes this series work so well, but work it does. I'm not sure that the concept holds up well throughout the enormous series, but the idea is fresh and exciting in this series opener, and some of the other earlier books.	2005-03-17

The first is about Rascal, the raccoon who is rescued by Sterling, the young narrator, and who becomes a member of the family. The second story, which is no less entertaining, is about a year in the life of a country boy, circa 1918.<br /><br />The book is organized by chapter, with each chapter usually covering a single month in the life of Sterling.<br /><br />Rascal has earned it's status as a beloved classic, by presenting an unforgettable tale of a boy who falls in love, and then must do the right thing. This is the same formula that makes other books tick, but it's hard to imagine anyone doing a better job than Sterling, who brings us into young Sterling's head so intimately that we share his joy, frustration, and sorrow as he rides an emotional roller coaster powered by Rascal.<br /><br />The intricately drawn black and white illustrations by John Schoenerr are also very good, capturing the classic spirit of the book with ease and style.<br /><br />This story has an amazing hook for young readers. What youngster hasn't dreamed of owning a pet raccoon, or some other exotic pet? Readers will learn important lessons about nature and the human spirit. This is a terrific book, and I highly recommend it.	2005-03-16

Besides Parker and his three partners, there's a suicidal doctor, a shaky ex-con on probation, the ex-con's sister, a bank manager's wife, a pair of bounty hunters, and a female police detective, who is both unusually attractive and unusually sharp.  <br /> <br />With all of these elements rattling around (and a few others that I haven't mentioned), it's hard to imagine that everything will go smoothly, and the final fifty pages or so are steeped in tension and foreboding that will keep you turning pages until you hit the end. <br /> <br />As for the ending itself, it's kind of a cliffhanger. I've only read a handful of Parker novels, and didn't expect to be left hanging like that, but I'll withhold my criticism on the assumption that  the next book will pick up where this one leaves off. If it doesn't, I'll be sorely disappointed (and a little confused as to why Stark would fail to wrap things up).  <br /> <br />As always, the main attraction is the character of Parker, who is the ultimate practical-minded thief. He's driven by logic, but is still able to think creatively to solve the problems the plot throws at him, and keeps moving like the shark that he is.  <br /> <br />Don't make this your first Parker novel, but definitely consider it worthy of the series, which keeps us coming back for more.  <br />	2005-03-16

While all of the Golden Guides contain some information beyond that needed for identification, this book has much more of an emphasis on broadly educating readers about the intricacies of pond life. <br /> <br />Taking on an entire ecosystem, Reid has given himself plenty of space to talk about the various types of pond habitats, the nature of water and how that fits into the picture, and the different seasons as they affect pond life. I found all of these sections to be highly informative, with the Golden Guide trademark of sophisticated knowledge being passed on in manageable chunks.  <br /> <br />Reid doesn't talk down to the reader in the slightest; any young reader will sense that this guidebook is appropriate for amateur scientists of all ages.  <br /> <br />Even the identification section is more word-laden than other Golden Guides, and much emphasis is put upon identifying different families and classes of organisms, rather than being limited to species identification alone.  <br /> <br />No family that lives within striking distance of a pond should be without this handy little book. At the very least, it can provide a couple of magical afternoons exploring this amazing habitat together.  <br />	2005-03-15

Of those who do try, very few succeed.     Peter Beagle is one of the few who have succeeded.     The Last Unicorn successfully preserves the magic of a fairy tale over the course of about 250 pages, which is immensely difficult. The lyrical language and the unforgettable characters, who are both romantic and realistic, strike a chord that have made this book one of those converting accounts that each reader urges a friend to read.     The basic story is about a unicorn who lives in a wood with only a very vague sense of time, or the world beyond. When she becomes aware that she may be the last unicorn left in the world, she must venture forth from her safe haven and try to find out what has happened to her kind. On the way to an exciting climax with the mythic and forbidding Red Bull, she encounters danger in the form of harpies and witches. She also meets friends, most notably Schmendrick the sometimes-hapless magician, and the good-hearted Molly Grue, who has seen too much of the world.     I really liked the cartoon when it was first released, and would recommend it to anyone who has read the book. However, it hasn't aged particularly well, and shouldn't be viewed by anyone who hasn't read the book first.     Don't confuse this book with other \\"fantasy novels\\" that have become a formulaic genre of often-bad writing. This novel is a notch higher than other novels in the genre; indeed, it is one of the reasons that the genre began.	2005-03-15

By focusing on the most common representatives of each family branch of North American birds, the book makes classification far easier than a more comprehensive guide. For the typical bird watcher, the species covered in this book will allow for accurate identification at least 95% of the time, and you won't be wasting time agonizing over the slight differences between two subspecies. Each entry has a short descriptive paragraph that includes the size of the bird, a map displaying the range of the bird, and a beautiful color illustration that amply displays all of the identification points. A hard-core birder will no doubt prefer something more in-depth and comprehensive, but this is a great book to ease oneself into this captivating past-time.	2005-03-14

Each chapter bears the name of a particular student, who is generally the focus of the story. The stories themselves are whimsical, ranging from a boy who is tempted to pull the pigtails of the girl sitting in front of him to a rat attempting to pose as a student.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />I like that Sachar has written a new kind of children's book, which can occasionally teach a lesson or thread a coherent story, but is mostly focused on entertaining the reader. The stories are loosely connected, but work as stand-alones, making it ideal for a nightly bedtime story. That some of the stories fall flat doesn't matter so much, since there is always the next story to rescue the moment. Unlike Holes, which I would have to describe as his masterpiece, there is very little that is touching or asks for emotional investment. Instead, we get pure silliness. <br />	2005-03-14

Books	3	4	4	N	N	Entertaining and insightful	This was a big hit with me when I was a boy, showing that it can reach across gender lines to appeal to boys and girls who can empathize with the idea of being embarrassed by one's parents.  <br /> <br />The action follows the misadventures of Tina Steele, who is so ashamed of her sometimes-wacky mom that she tells her visiting friend that the woman in her home is actually her babysitter. This and a handful of embarrassments lead to a climax that teach Tina that lying to her friends is not a solution, and that her mother has feelings, too.  <br /> <br />The writing is straightforward, and the encounters have a certain amount of humor in them, but are not played up for big laughs. This is mostly a novel that will help children to think of their parents in a new way, without coming off as preachy.  <br />	2005-03-13

Many children like to pick up the shells they see, but what do they mean? Where do they come from? How does one associate them with the animals that used to live in them?<br /><br />This book will provide the answers to these questions, and do it in a way that will foment a lifelong interest in scientific study. It demonstrates that when you want to get something out of a book, you have to put a little something into the book, but it falls short of being difficult or frustrating.<br /><br />The color illustrations are very well-done, capturing both the indentification points and the beauty of these amazing creatures.	2005-03-13

The large hard cover edition is dominated by outstanding drawings and photographs, and each page is festooned with eye candy. There is also quite a bit of text, mostly in the form of in-depth captions, but also as stand-alone short essays.  <br /> <br />Material covered includes historical inventions, inventors at home and universities, and an A to Z listing of everything from the Automobile Self-Starter to the Zipper. If you have a child who has demonstrated an aptitude for engineering or any other invention-oriented field, I would strongly recommend that you purchase this book as a means of inspiration. This book shows that the application of inventive thought can bring great rewards for the inventor and for society.  <br />	2005-03-13

The narrative bounces back and forth through his memories and his current position, which is as a kind of wise old grandfather figure who lives across the road from Brookfield. We learn about his gradual transformation from young disciplinarian to kindly old charmer; the older he gets, the more he indulges those around him with his jokes and the more beloved he becomes.  <br /> <br />The prose is pretty ornamental, with lots of descriptive adjectives and ornate notations about the passing of the seasons, or the years. The idea of a man who has become inextricably linked with an institution is an interesting one, and obviously Hilton struck a chord with some people, many of whom have sent him letters about the \\"real\\" Mr. Chips.  <br /> <br />The book struck no such chord with me, personally, but I did enjoy the portrait of the kindly old man, and appreciated that the brevity of the tale allowed me to finish it in a single sitting.  <br /> <br />My edition weighs in at a scant 115 pages, and about half that space is filled with drawings (by Sanford Kossin, which I did not much care for) and the white space at the beginning or end of the 18 chapters. The actual text is in fairly large words, so I think you're actually looking at the equivalent of about 40 pages of reading in a typical novel.  <br /> <br />If there is a teacher in your memory who may have taught both your father and your son, this book will speak to you, and I would highly recommend it. Even if this isn't the case, you might pick it up just because your time investment will be so small.  <br />	2005-03-12

The text is simple and straightforward, mostly consisting of descriptions of 475 species that one is likely to come upon while prowling the seashore.  <br /> <br />The most common species from each species type have been selected, with types ranging from protozoa to annelids to birds.  <br /> <br />There is also an overview of sea life, with some interesting facts and figures. Tellingly, this field book includes a note on the importance of wildlife preservation and environmental protection; I appreciated that this was a standard feature of guidebooks back in the day.  <br /> <br />The pictures are extremely well-detailed and useful for identification, and really make the argument that artistic renderings can be more useful than photographs in these books.  <br /> <br />I'm sure there are better books out there for the purposes of identification, but this might be a good starter book for a young person looking to put a name to the things they see at the seashore. Someone interested in fifties memorabilia or old guidebooks will also find this a nice addition to their collection.  <br />	2005-03-12
318391:US	20422170	R36SYHVYCLRGM3	0375725601	517121775	The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America	Books	4	10	12	N	N	Starts off plodding, finishes with a dash	This book documents the history of the Chicago World Fair put on in the 1890s, with the emphasis being on the planning of the fair by architect Daniel Burnham, and the sick depredations of H.H. Holmes, a mass murderer who operated with a quiet audacity amid the chaos and bustle of the fair and the times.     We also get lesser, but significant, focus on an insane man who murders the mayor of Chicago, and the detective who seeks to find a group of children last seen with Holmes.     I do have some criticisms of this book, but first let me say that Larson has done an amazing job of researching the period, and of bringing that research to life in a way that paints a very complete, and enjoyable, picture for the reader. He has drawn on many sources to bring his own vision to life, creating an illusion of the times using so many etymological flourishes and so much care that the monumental epic could be seen as a metaphor for the fair itself.     The text contains many interesting anecdotes, and weaves in all of the famous personages that we can handle, recounting the fair as it appeared to Buffalo Bill Cody, Helen Keller, and Theodore Dreiser, among many others.     Larson also lays his finger on the big issues of the day, which included impending economic devastation, a sense of competition between Chicago and New York (and between the US and France), and the rise of organized labor.     As I reached the halfway mark of this book, I got more and more interested in the ongoing events, and found soon thereafter that I couldn't really put it down without picking it right back up again. Generating this level of interest is evidence of Larson's ability to weave a narrative story that demands to be finished.     On the downside, I feel that Larson also takes certain liberties which are just not acceptable, and which intrude upon the text rather than having the desired effect of enhancing it. For example, he recounts an anecdote that Holmes tells of his childhood about being dragged into a doctor's office by two bullies and confronted with a frightening human skeleton. Then he writes:    \\"The incident probably did occur, but with a different choreography. More likely the two older boys discovered that their five-year-old victim did not mind the excursion; that far from struggling and shrieking he merely gazed at the skeleton with cool appreciation.        \\"When his eyes settled back upon his captors, it was they who fled.\\"    Now, I ask you: What is the possible purpose of this invention? Larson is basically making up a story here without any real reason to speculate on what happened in that doctor's office, and is trying to implant the idea that Holmes was a born psychopath, ready at five years old to embark on his killing spree. Personally, I don't think a five year old boy has the capacity to act as Larson suggests, but even if there was clinical evidence that Larson could cite about the mental state of toddler-psychopaths (which he doesn't), he's still fabricating these details. This seemed so clunky and unnecessary that it really detracted from my enjoyment.     My second problem is that Larson has a thing for big words, and the overall effect is sometimes pretentious. He won't say coal when he can say anthracite, for example, and this leads to some stuffiness that will no doubt turn off some readers. I'm much more a fan of using language to communicate the story as clearly as possible, and wish that Larson hadn't sought to draw so much attention to the language itself.     Larson also seems to lionize Burnham, and doesn't seem interested in exploring any of the darker side of what he's done. Burnham's opposition to and conflict with organized labor seemed like one potential area for critical analysis, but the corker for me was when Burnham hosts a visit in his office from Susan Hayden, the brilliant architect who designed the Woman's Building. Hayden had found herself in conflict with some of the high society women when she refusedto accept certain gifts donated with the intent that they be displayed in the Woman's Building. Hayden felt that they didn't fall within her vision, and was taking a certain amount of heat for it. A higher-up took the responsibility of decorating the building away from her, and she went to see Burnham about it. Larson writes:    \\"She walked into Burnham's office, began to tell him her story, and promptly, literally, went mad: tears, heaving sobs, cries of anguish, all of it. 'A severe breakdown,' an acquaintance called it, 'with a violent attack of high nervous excitement of the brain.'        \\"Burnham, stunned, summoned one of the exposition surgeons. Hayden was discreetly driven from the park in one of the fair's innovative English ambulances with quiet rubber tires and placed in a sanitarium for a period of enforced rest. She lapsed into 'melancholia,' a sweet name for depression.\\"    I have to say that this passage drove me batty. The shipping of women to insane asylums during this period has become a well-known travesty, and the fact that this highly pressured woman went to Burnham for help, broke down in a crying fit, and was shipped off to an asylum seems like it might have been a very big injustice. Larson should have taken Burnham to task for this callous act victimizing a fellow organizer; at the very least, Larson shouldn't have characterized her fit of tears as a prompt and literal conversion to insanity. If any other architect had been sent to an asylum, I'm sure that the diagnosis would have been held up to scrutiny, and I was disgusted that Larson failed to do that in this case.     My final criticism is that Larson has, at times, included too much information for my tastes. At a dense 400 pages, this is a daunting book for the casual reader, and much of the information seems to have been included in an effort to be comprehensive, rather than in the service of entertaining the reader. To create a metaphor from within the book, I feel that the story should be more like Olmsted's playful and mysterious Wooded Isle, but Larson has given it the heft and bulk of the Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building.     Specifically, I think that less biographical information should have been given on Burnham and the other architects. The early interactions between the architects is explained in too much detail, with every early letter and meeting recounted. These things contribute to the slow beginning, and almost everyone I've spoken to about this book has said that the first fifty pages are really slow, and a deterrent to further reading.     Throughout the book, there are also lesser examples of too much information, most strikingly in the habit of reprinting, in their entirety, the menus of important dinners to show how fancy the food was. I could see this being used as a device once, but Larson reprints entire menus three times!     Despite these shortcomings, this is still a terrific book, and will serve as the definitive history of this great event. The story of Holmes, which could certainly have been a separate book, is cleverly integrated to break up the story of the fair (of course, by the end, the story of the fair is so engrossing that it doesn't need any breaking up).     I highly recommend this books to anyone with an interest in American history, or to anyone who has an interest in true crime stories. If you're not used to true crime stories, proceed with caution, because the details of Holmes' acts are truly disturbing.	2005-03-12

They are \\"A Trick to Catch the Old One,\\" \\"The Revenger's Tragedy,\\" \\"A Chaste Maid in Cheapside,\\" \\"Women Beware Women,\\" and \\"The Changeling.\\" <br /> <br />As a group, I wouldn't necessarily recommend these for pleasure reading. To me, they lack the flair that so many of Shakespeare's works had, and the cultural barriers presented by the intervening ages are sufficient to deter my pleasure.  <br /> <br />If you are very comfortable with the language of the period, I think you'd probably find them very well done, but that qualification rules out just about everybody, I suppose.  <br /> <br />If you would like to read one just to get a feel for Middleton, I would recommend \\"A Chaste Maid in Cheapside,\\" which is probably the liveliest of the five.  <br /> <br />This edition also has a pleasantly succinct introduction that covers all of the particulars about Middleton in the typical Penguinian manner of brisk efficiency.  <br /> <br />You're probably only going to pick this up because you have a teacher who is requiring that you do so. If this is the case, this text is appropriate for intermediate levels of study.  <br />	2005-03-11

Authors Gary Ferguson and Rick Bass (who spent some wilderness time with Peacock) have managed to make this model of environmental conservation seem childish and churlish. But Peacock, who is basically writing the same argument, gives this idea wings on which we soar.  <br /> <br />Peacock is brutally honest about himself, and about how his war experiences in Vietnam shattered his soul and left him thrashing about the country in a state of spiritual agony. When he relates a story about becoming frustrated with a payphone operator, and then taking out a shotgun and blowing the telephone to bits, we know that he's not billing himself as a healthy individual.  <br /> <br />This honesty lets us see the genuine love that Peacock has for nature in general and grizzly bears in particular. He is well-versed in the scientific side of environmental preservation, and gives us plenty to chew on as far as the good and bad of the institutions that are involved with grizzly bear issues. But his most compelling, unique contributions come when he is alone in the wild, stalking grizzly bears carrying nothing but photography equipment and a knife, with which he is prepared to defend himself to the death.  <br /> <br />This is a great book for theenvironmental movement, and deserves a unique place in that broad and cluttered field. You should definitely read this book if you're an environmentalist. More importantly, you should give it to someone who is not an environmentalist, even someone who is against environmentalism.  <br /> <br />Peacock has a way of framing the issues in a way that even a republican will love and understand. His individualistic approach and character are the antithesis of the characterization of environmentalists that the right has been pushing for the last forty years. <br />	2005-03-11

The notes are extremely simple, usually serving as a modern glossary for antiquated words and phrases, but occasionally going into more depth when necessary. There are also dozens and dozens of black and white reproductions of works of art that are related to the text. This helps to illustrate certain concepts in the text, and also to give a sense of flavor to the sometimes dry play. <br /> <br />If you're going to read Faust, you could do a lot worse than this edition.  <br />	2005-03-11

Ademan points out, and makes much hay of the fact, that Shakespeare began writing his great tragedies simultaneously with the introduction of the first fully imagined mother- character.     Personally, I find it difficult to make the intuitive leaps that Adelman has made in drawing conslusions about Shakespeare's \\"troubled meditation on infantile helplessness.\\" I find that Shakespeare's work is just so amazingly complex, and the body of work is so large, that an enterprising scholar can read just about anything into it.     People have written extensively on Shakespeare and how he anticipated Freud's theories, feminism, major issues within catholicism, even communism and capitalism. It's hard for me to become overly sympathetic with any of these views, and Adelman's book, while well-written (if a bit abstruse), is no exception.     Shakespeare has written about life, grounding it in realism and also elevating it to an entity of great meaning. Anyone who so finely articulates the human condition can and will be open to a variety of specialized interpretations, as well as the opposite interpretations.     I think that books like this one are valuable, in that they identify a viewpoint that can be expressed and studied within the context of Shakespeare's work. But the final word on Shakespeare has to be much broader in scope, and I would urge all but the most serious scholars to beware the tunnel vision that this type of undertaking can inadvertently create.     Did Shakespeare have strong views on motherhood, and can we extrapolate to speculate on his own relationship with his mother? Perhaps. But we won't ever really know for sure, and that might be a good thing.	2005-03-10

They try everything from playing the stock market to erecting a toll booth, and the wacky cast of supporting characters (including my favorite, science nerd Eelmer Drimsdale) offers up plenty of yuks.  <br /> <br />Some of the best material comes in the midst of a talent show that Bruno and Boots put on, with predictably entertaining (and somewhat disastrous) results.  <br /> <br />Written very early in Korman's career (which began well before he graduated high school), this book is one of the ones upon which his reputation for humor and well-paced novels was based. As a new, fresh writer, Korman showed that he had something to say, and young readers everywhere were all ears.  <br /> <br />It is true that his characters can be cartoonish, and the actions often stray from the realm of believability, but you just have to accept that as part of the fun.  <br /> <br />This is a great book to cut your Korman-teeth on.

And if you're going to choose a comedy, you might as well get a funny one. <br /> <br />This play doesn't try to mix drama or even a very cohesive story line in with the humor. The philosophy is to make the audience laugh, and then make them laugh harder. Comedy can be a difficult thing to pull off, but the natural enthusiasm of a middle school or high school cast can go a long way toward success. <br /> <br />This play has the added bonus of writing behind-the-scenes mistakes into the script, so a rather sloppy production will find that a few foibles will be forgiven, or even missed. <br /> <br />The plot involves a rightful heir who has been taken from the palace as a baby, and raised by squirrels (represented engagingly by brown sock puppets). In his quest to regain his rightful throne, he must overcome an evil King, and all the minions that can be mustered.  <br />	2005-03-10

Isn't he that guy from A Knight's Tale with Heath?	\\"Our Host called out `Be quiet, that's enough! <br />Shut up, and let the woman tell her tale. <br />You must be drunk, you've taken too much ale. <br />Now, Ma'am, you go ahead and no demur.' <br />`All right,' said she, `it's just as you prefer, <br />If I have licence from this worthy friar.' <br />`Nothing,' said he, `that I should more desire.'\\" <br /> <br />This is the translation that I cut my teeth on (along with probably millions of others in classrooms around the world), and so I have a predisposition to praise Coghill's work.  <br /> <br />There's something about this translation that smacks of authenticity; the simple rhyme scheme and antiquated, if easily comprehensible, English really make us feel that we're reading the words as Chaucer wrote them. There's nothing in the way of analysis or notes; after a brief introduction that lays out who Chaucer was and where the tales come from, he lets it rip.  <br /> <br />The tales themselves are deserving of their fame because of the way that they manage to be maintain a literary value and yet still appeal to the masses. While each tale stands alone (and some of them stand alone very well indeed), the device of a group of disparate strangers stuck together that comprises the frame is exceptionally captivating. There's something very neat and pat about the concept: two tales each on the way, and two tales each on the way back.  <br /> <br />Even though this was obviously never accomplished, we still get fun interaction between the principles, and get a feel for what the entire project would have looked like (like a thicker book, I suppose, but I digress).  <br /> <br />That Chaucer used this unifying element to bring together stories from other sources is to his credit, because the variety of sources adds to the concept, by creating starkly different tales that ably bear out the voices of their various tellers.  <br /> <br />If you have any sort of interest at all in the classics, or have enjoyed the stories tobe found in traditional folklore and the greek myths, I urge you to give this edition a shot when trying Chaucer.  <br />	2005-03-10

He is full of vitality and humor, and is never afraid to stand up to any authority he perceives as being wrong-headed. <br /> <br />When he's sentenced to an asylum, and comes into conflict with the wonderfully wicked Nurse Ratched, a war ensures that escalates beyond all reason. Ratched is determined to preserve her dictatorial authority over the ward, and McMurphy is equally determined to rebel.  <br /> <br />The story line also features a cast of unforgettable supporting characters, from the strong and stoic Chief Bromdem to the pathetically vulnerable Billy Bibbit. Their background noise, and their status as pawns in the ongoing chess match between McMurphy and Ratched, breathe life into the play and elevate it above other plays.  <br /> <br />While the issue of patient abuse in mental wards has long since become old news (thanks in part to the novel), the universal issues of human dignity and compassion are what ultimately makes this play tick. <br /> <br />I recommend this play, both to prospective readers and to theater folks trying to decide on their next production.

The authentic details that flesh out life in the small town of Adenville, Utah are great touches and elevate the story above similar tales that take place in the present. The series also banks on the realistic and lovable main characters, especially John D. and Tom himself.  <br /> <br />Despite all that, I have to say that this is the weakest of the Great Brain books.  Tom's adventures are more grandiose than in the others, and I think that the series is more comfortable when Tom is operating within the realm of his peers, rather than conning the entire town on a big scale. He creates a stir when he convinces the entire town that a monster walks among them at night, and later in the book seeks to capture a ghost that has scared him and the other children away from an old mine. These episodes are just a little less fun than when Tom is conning quarters and dimes from the other kids.  <br /> <br />Another chapter that I had a problem with was \\"The Taming of Britches Dotty,\\" which is so demeaning toward women that I think it would actually be harmful for any child who reads it. Britches Dotty is essentially a rough and tumble cowgirl whom Tom \\"tames\\" by teaching her to wear pretty dresses and \\"act like a girl.\\" He also teaches her to read and write, so it's not like the chapter couldn't work with some revision, but the notion that girls have to dress nicely, act demurely, and look pretty is so out of touch that the chapter should be altered or removed before it's given to a child.  <br /> <br />But these books are episodic, and I do have to say that, on the positive side, this book has one of the best episodes in the entire series, which is when Papa and the boys get hopelessly lost among the local canyons, withPapa despairing that they will make it out alive.  <br /> <br />There is also a touching chapter about the boys heading up a funeral for a local dog.  <br /> <br />Mercer Meyer's detailed sketches are absolutely wonderful, with lots of detail and shading, and characters that retain some of their cartoonishness even as they look real.  <br /> <br />This is a terrific series, and everyone who reads it will enjoy it.  <br />	2005-03-08

I'm sure that this was a budget consideration, but the fact that the colors are so integral to what gives a comic book its identity makes this impossible to overlook. <br /> <br />The text itself is very well done, basically laying out the storylines and characters for hundreds upon hundreds of classic comic books that have largely been forgotten. Anyone who wants to take a look at the time when \\"Crime Detective,\\" \\"Sheena: Queen of the Jungle,\\" and \\"Crack Comics\\" shared equal shelf space with the early superhero comics will be delighted by the information and reproductions that comprise this book.  <br /> <br />The pages that do contain color are vivid and evocative of the golden years of comic books; the rest are still extremely well done.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended for comic book fans who would like to give some context to the current state of the industry. <br />	2005-03-07

In this play, the two titular characters are fleshed out to be absurdly, and comically, inept in some ways, and very human and sympathetic in others. They play at deep thought, and this play is meant to lead the audience into musings that aren't necessarily articulated on the stage.     The humor is very off the wall, reminiscent of both Waiting for Godot, to which its often compared, and certain parts of Douglas Adams' \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" trilogy.     The showdown between logic and the absurd is always, thankfully, entertaining, and this is as much fun to read as it is to see on stage. In fact, it might be a better read than it is a play, as the slow, thoughtful pace may give some audiences too much time for checking their watches.	2005-03-07

In his introduction, Roche goes on at length to explain why a strictly literal translation is not always the best course; he has done what he can to capture the essence of the original poetry, sometimes sacrificing a more literal translation.  <br /> <br />That being said, this trilogy of tragedy remains inaccessible to the casual reader, with the verse, antiquated phrases, and lengthy unnatural monologues and speeches combining to obscure the beautiful and tragic story from the mind and heart of what might otherwise be an appreciative audience.  <br /> <br />So where does this leave us? Did Roche waste his time by coming up with a version of the play that is neither authentic nor accessible? In my opinion, he did not. This book is an invaluable asset for intermediary scholars who are not ready (and may never be ready) to apply themselves to the actual text or a literal translation, and yet are willing to devote themselves to overcoming the obstacles that the non-traditional (by modern standards) format presents. <br /> <br />An english student, or an armchair literary enthusiast, will find this an excellent way to experience the power of Sophocles writing in english. The translation is beautiful, and powerful, and does indeed bring one of the most tragic and deeply resonating of stories to life; you just have to work a little to get there.  <br />	2005-03-07

Never having been to France, I was surprised to see how much unmarred natural beauty there is in a place with so much history and culture.  <br /> <br />Nor does Alain ignore the cultural riches that France has to offer. There are the expected icons that can't be left out, such as the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower, but there are also a slew of lesser known sites of historical interest and the art world.  <br /> <br />This isn't a book that will tell you where the restrooms are, or the best hotels in the area. However, someone planning to visit should pick it up because it inspires excitement by selling France as a repository of magical, intriguing destinations for the wandering heart.  <br />	2005-03-07

The characters and the writing are solid, if predictable, but the plot has too much emphasis on the struggling sports team of misfits, most notably a superstar girl player who must hide her gender as she racks up the wins for the team. <br /> <br />I'm just used to the Bruno and Boots series dishing up more original storylines, and I think that it was a good thing that Korman moved on to other characters when he did.  <br /> <br />Korman remains a great writer who has a real knack for bringing out the humor in strange situations. However, in this particular book, everything just seems a little stale, especially the idea that Bruno and Boots continue to fear the Fish, even though after umpteen years of breaking the rules, his austere personality hasn't yet manifested itself in the form of severe consequences.  <br /> <br />If you are a Bruno and Boots fan, by all means read this book, but if you're picking up this author for the first time, start at the beginning of this hilarious series and work your way through them chronologically.  <br />	2005-03-07

Middle English is vaguely comprehensible to the average reader, but the stumbling pace of reading in that nearly-dead tongue of long ago doesn't exactly lend itself to a pleasurable reading experience.  <br /> <br />By eschewing verse, this translation has feed itself from the contraints of a rhyme or meter scheme, and instead Lumiansky has concentrated on telling us what Chaucer was trying to communicate.  <br /> <br />The end result is a uniquely accessible text that brings Chaucer down from the ivory towers into the homes of casual readers everywhere.  <br /> <br />This book is not going to replace any more scholarly or authentic translations, however, it is a supplement to those readings that might give the Chaucer student a new way of experiencing the original text. Ideally, a casual reader will enjoy these exciting tales so much that they will seek out an education in these historic, ambitious writings that comment on facets of man's nature that have remained constant throughout the ages.  <br />	2005-03-07

This book is my only experience with him, and that may explain the review that is to follow. <br /> <br />This is the most insipid, cheese-ridden pile of bushwah I've even had the displeasure of picking up. Perhaps Kuralt has an indefinable quality that somehow brings some authenticity to the words that are printed on these pages, but the material itself is just terrible.  <br /> <br />I was reminded of a Simpson's episode in which Bart Simpson wins admiration from everyone by peddling schmaltzy \\"human interest\\" stories on a children's news program they've started.  Now, the fact that I watch Simpson's and am criticizing Kuralt may be indicative of a generation gap that is the root of the problem, but I don't see how anyone of any age could give credence to the heavy-handed moralism that Kuralt trots out, not just occasionally, but in virtually every single segment. <br /> <br />A truly do appreciate the value of nuanced, small town life and the individuals who dare to go against the grain in some way. But is it necessary to spotlight someone who has given their nine children rhyming names (Terry, Sherry, Jerry, etc.)?  <br /> <br />There's something about Kuralt's line that seems insincere. Clearly, at times, he's stretching to find greater meaning in something that is maybe a little interesting, but ultimately meaningless. This leads me to think that all of it is insincere, that Kuralt is going to find the cuteness and greater meaning in everything, truth be damned. Even aside from the heavy-handed schmaltziness, it seems like a lot of the people portrayed in this feature are being capitalized on. Some of the people will certainly be ridiculed by most of the viewers; at any rate, they have had their quirky individuality processed and used for the very corporate interests that they flout. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of Charles Kuralt, I think that the tv segments that you fell in love with should probably be where your love affair ends. Kuralt may be a winning personality and a good salesman; if that's true, I recommend that you stick with the news broadcasts, where you can enjoy him as he grew famous: a little bit at a time. <br />	2005-03-04

Well, okay, he knows how to make us laugh _until_ we cry, and who would want it any other way? <br /> <br />This series of fragmented memoirs is at its most entertaining when Sedaris relates his childhood memories of growing up in a typically dysfunctional family. He never fails to show himself as self-serving, and this brutal honesty makes us love him all the more. And he doesn't spare his family any either; in one memorable scene, his mother and sister are emulating the methods of a fictional detective they enjoy as they read the crime reports in the daily news.  <br /> <br />\\"We know that the girl was held at knifepoint on the second floor of her house,\\" Lisa said, tapping a pencil against her forehead. So the person who robbed her was...not in a...wheelchair.\\" <br /> <br />Moments later, the mother reveals her own brilliant deduction, that a professional thief would have used a gun while this person could only afford a knife, meaning that the culprit was clearly a drug addict.  <br /> <br />This is just hilarious material, and while it does become slightly less enjoyable as young David's world expands and grows more complicated, the writing remains top notch throughout. Sedaris joins only a handful of other authors who have written their memoirs with the reader's enjoyment as the first priority.  <br /> <br />If you are leery of autobiographical writing because of the self-inflating nature of the genre, please make Naked the only memoir you every buy.  <br /> <br />You won't be disappointed.  <br />	2005-03-04

When Travis's father leaves unavoidably, Travis becomes the man of the house, with burdens that modern readers will marvel over. Old Yeller helps Travis to get through a number of tough spots, including a battle between two mad bulls, a skirmish with wild hogs, and a bear attack.  But when Travis hears about an onset of \\"hydrophobia\\" among the local wildlife, he can't be prepared for the toll that it will take on him and his family. <br /> <br />Modern readers of all ages can thrill in the stories of children living on the wild frontier. With the wildest frontier times a full century behind us, there's still something that resonates within everyone who cares to read about that exciting time in history. Gipson has captured that magic perfectly.  <br /> <br />The Disney movie version, produced decades after this book, has not aged nearly as well as the original book has. Scenes that seem cheesy on screen are still powerful and immediate in the book (which was always better anyhow). <br /> <br />I highly recommend this captivating tale, along with the Little House on the Prairie Books and \\"The Day No Pigs Would Die,\\" by Peck. <br />	2005-03-03

As he does with anything he writes, he has taken out all of the boring bits, and left the most shocking and intriguing parts behind to tell his story.  <br /> <br />     Children and adults alike will be alternately delighted and horrified (or, even more often, delightedly horrified) by the true stories from Dahl's childhood, which range from the Great Mouse Plot to a graphic look at the beatings he and other students endured at the hands of their boarding-school administrators and peers.  <br /> <br />     We also get to see the most barbaric side of early medical practice, as every doctor who makes a brief appearance in the book seems hell-bent on causing the patient as much pain and suffering as can be imagined.  <br /> <br />     We can see Dahl's childhood memories as he sees them, and there are many obvious starting points for some of his most famous (and less famous) stories. The beating that Danny, Champion of the World, endures is alluded to, as is the strong Norwegian grandmother character from The Witches, among others.  <br /> <br />     This is not a definitive biography by any means; rather, this is a pleasant jaunt through a series of interesting stories that have the added benefit of teaching us a little more about the man behind some of the most beloved books of his time.  <br /> <br />     I enjoyed this tremendously as a tween, and I still enjoy it today.

The book isn't a musical, obviously, and it has spectacles and scenes which could never have been brought to the screen at the time it was published. Also, the land of Oz has more of a culture and political atmosphere than the film makes note of.     That being said, this book is a wild ride through the imagination of Frank L. Baum, with elements from our world transformed in bizarre ways that could never have been anticipated. The entire idea of a talking scarecrow is brilliantly imaginative, if you think about it, as is the cowardly talking lion, the winged monkeys, and the magical field of flowers which puts the adventurers to sleep.     Oz is a wonderland unlike any other, and children will delight in the magical surprises that lurk around every bend in the yellow brick road. The special magic of this extensive series is that despite the magic suffusing every nook and cranny of Oz, there are familiar objects and creature from our world that keep us grounded.     However, the older you are, the less you will enjoy this book, because it has some pretty serious flaws by modern standards.    The language has become quite dated, and the goody-goody dialogue can be jarring to someone who has grown used to a more modern approach. If this book were released today, I don't believe it would ever enjoy the type of success that it did then.     Luckily, this book is written for the children, who can generally forgive the fact that characters talk a little strangely (as long as it's consistent, which it is), and the sometimes clunky plot turns.     For a child, the focus will be on the King of Mice, or the terrible Kalidah, just two of the magical creatures that escaped the screenplay for the movie. Baum's flights of fancy are so eccentric that children will be fascinated by the wonders they encounter.	2005-03-03

White takes his first stab at writing children's books, and Stuart Little was such a success that 55 years after publication, his book was still popular enough to merit a dreadful Hollywood film adaptation.  <br /> <br />     Stuart Little is the story of a mouse born to human parents, who eventually runs away from home and relies on his indomitable pluck to carry him on a journey to find Margalo, a bird who has mysteriously disappeared after a short layover in the Little home. Along the way, Stuart has adventures aplenty, including a one-day stint as a substitute teacher, and a toy sailboat race.  <br /> <br />     Generally, children's authors who write fantasy either bring a spot of magic into the real world, said magic being a source of amazement for all who experience it, or they create an entirely fantastic world in which magic (or futuristic or spiritual) things happen. White has taken the road less travelled, in that he has brought fantastic elements into the real world that, absurdly, everyone takes in stride.  <br /> <br />     This approach leads to some great scenes in which the everyday world incorporates a mouse who can talk and drive, a model car that runs on gasoline and can turn invisible at the touch of a button, and a talking bird can wander in from the skies. People are interested to see these things, but treat them as the same type of curiosity as an exotic animal or unusual hat.   <br /> <br />     The book is also suffused with well-done humor, often based on engaging wordplay or clever logic. The jokes range from the broadest to the most subtle, ensuring that the book will appeal to you whether you are hearing it read aloud, reading it yourself, or reading it to a youngster.  <br /> <br />     The scene in which Stuart teaches a classroom of children is particularly funny, with Stuart turning the lesson into a spirited banter that involves testing out how life out to be. <br /> <br />     This novel lacks the poignant emotional appeal of Charlotte's Web, but the willingness to flaunt the rules of children's books nearly makes up for this. Children will love the strong visual images that they take from the book (helped along by the illustrations which adorn nearly every page), and adults will come to appreciate the audaciousness of Stuart, who is always ready to jump into a daunting situation with only his wits about him. <br /> <br />     This is definitely a classic, and should be on every child's bookshelf.	2005-03-02

It's difficult to translate the plot and feel of an epic into a form that younger readers can enjoy, but that's just what Richard Adams has done here.          Watership Down tells the story of a group of rabbits who, driven by the forebodings of a psychic bunny named Fiver, decide to abandon their warren and strike out on their own to found a new rabbit community. The group of rabbits sets out on a long and perilous journey, encountering every type of danger imaginable, and must pool their various talents under the leadership of the noble Hazel to survive.          Something about these rabbits is so amazingly real that it's impossible not to get wrapped up in their lives. Adams has given them the power of speech and the ability to plan ahead, but they possess severe limitations that make their interactions seem realistic. Along the way, they find other rabbit warrens that have their own way of doing things, and Hazel's little band must find a way to forge a rabbit utopia that avoids the pitfalls of the societies they face.          The ending involves climactic battle scenes with General Woundwort, a militaristic dictator who embodies bunny evil.         Each of the rabbits in Hazel's group has a distinct personality that goes beyond embodiment of a stereotypical character trait. You will love each of them in turn, and also come to appreciate the culture in which they operate, complete with rabbit-only words and folk tales that resonate with meaning.          Watership Down has the intelligence of a literary classic, and the accessibility of a great and moving read. This is the perfect book to transition a young reader from children's books to adult novels, and I wasn't at all surprised to hear that it has become a staple in some classrooms.

But embark he reluctantly does, and what follows is an adventure that is far more charming, if less epic, than the pomp-laden Rings trilogy.<br /><br />  Tolkien presents his own twist on existing mythologies and fairy tales, giving us a game of riddling and presenting, for the first time, in-depth cultures that defined orcs, elves, trolls, dwarves and humans under a unifying concept that has lasted for well over a half-century (and counting).<br /><br />  Okay, okay, so this book is important in the annals of fantasy. But is it a good read?<br /><br />  Yes.<br /><br />  Tolkien has taken all of this in-depth detail and hung it on a time-honored plot that will never get old. Bilbo is the unlikely, reluctant adventurer who finds within himself the capacity to be a hero, overcoming various obstacles to a climax involving a firebreathing dragon (the evil Smaug). Stories don't get any more exciting than this, and the details that are Tolkien's trademark add a layer of depth and texture that help to bring this world to life.<br /><br />  If you are considering reading the Lord of the Rings because the movies made such a big splash, or have already started that trilogy but been turned off by the weightiness, I urge you to start with the Hobbit. It is clean, easy reading that really inspired everything that came after it. The trilogy is everything that a Tolkien fan could want, but The Hobbit is what makes Tolkien fans happen.	2005-03-02
331996:US	20422170	RO7YAP9Z8OZU4	0345391802	458212829	The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Weird, funny, strangely logical satire of our world	This is the first, and undoubtedly the best, of the several books that (somewhat confusingly) make up the Hitchiker's trilogy.          Adams has blended a fantastic sense of humor with a brand of philosophical thinking that would have left Socrates tied up in mental knots.          There aren't too many books that lead off with the destruction of the earth. After all, where do you go from there? Adams uses this departure point to take us into outer space, where advanced interstellar communication is old news, and the collaboration of alien species is as common as it is in Star Wars. But this tongue-in-cheek universe is a far cry from that straight-laced epic series.          The rulers of this universe are often bogged down in the same type of senseless rituals and paperwork requirements that plague the corporate and bueaucratic world here on Earth.          Adams throws so many curveballs and insane elements at us at once that it's difficult to know what to expect when you turn each page.          There's no sense in trying to explain the impact on the plot of a Vogon construction fleet, a ship powered by an Improbability Drive, or the long sought after answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything.  You just have to read it.          This might sound like the book itself is confusing, but that's actually not true. Adams has a way of explaining the inexplicable in a way that makes it, if not completely logical, at least entertaining.          I highly recommend this book, especially to a young teen reader who might be looking for some answers that aren't in the rule book. This book might not have the answers either, but at least it raises the questions. Or maybe it doesn't even raise the questions so much as make us laugh about the results.     Or something like that.     Anyway, this is a must-read. I can only hope that the impending movie does it justice.	2005-03-01
332180:US	20422170	REYCD18FID5LN	0141304707	256728441	The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar	Books	5	34	35	N	N	Good for any age	This is probably the best collection of Roald Dahl's short stories in existence.  <br /> <br />     Although he is best known for writing children's novels, Dahl was a master of the short story, and always wanted to be known for writing something above the level of children. <br /> <br />     This book contains all the stories that combine his best elements; they are short stories, some of which have literary aspersions above his most famous novels, and yet they are accessible enough to be read by all ages.  <br /> <br />     Needless to say, they are intensely, wickedly good.  <br />     The collection contains seven stories, which range from 16 to 70 pages in length. The final two are definitely more adult oriented; _Lucky Break_ is a memoir-style account of how he went from being a poor english student to a professional writer, and _A Piece of Cake_ is his first published story, which appears to be based on his wartime experiences without necessarily being 100% accurate in its minor details. For an enthusiastic Dahl fan like myself, getting a glimpse of the man behind the curtain is exciting, and getting to know more about Dahl is a real treat.  <br />     Really, all of the stories are just fantastic, so I won't bother repeating how good each one is . But the stories are: <br />     _The Boy Who Talked With Animals_ , which is about a young tourist boy at a beach resort who seeks to free a giant sea turtle which has been captured by the hotel management. This sounds like a children's story, but the characterization and the setting are quite adult.  <br />     _The Hitchhiker_ is an amusing tale about a british hitchhiker who reveals himself to be a fingersmith, a master classman of the pickpocketing profession. The interplay between three different levels of british society-the journalist driver, the rough cockney passenger, and a belligerent traffic cop, are very fun. <br />     _The Mildenhall Treasure_ is an oddball story that is different because it's true (and not a firsthand experience). It tells the story of a plowman who comes across a great cache of valuable silver while plowing in the fields one day, and the way that it affects his life.  <br />     _The Swan_ is a story about childhood cruelty, in which a weak and inoffensive boy is pushed to the absolute limits of his endurance by two beebeegun-toting bullies who catch him in the woods alone. There is a surprise ending here that I've come to adore over the years.  <br />     _The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar_ is about a greedy man (Henry Sugar) who decides to apply himself to learn the powers of an indian yogi. This is a frame story around two interior stories that have the same themes, are fascinating in their own right, and which give weight to Henry's story. He finds that he can indeed learn the powers, but not without changing himself. This story ends with the type of madcap scheming that colors so many of his children's books. <br /> <br />     I loved each one of these stories, from the time I was a preteen right through today, twenty years later. They all display Dahl's ability to find the most interesting parts of a story, and to make them even more interesting. Even better, many of these stories have something to say, which gives them some literary merit even as they entertain us.   <br /> <br />     If you like these stories, you might give his adult short story collections a try (collections I would recommend are The Umbrella Man and Skin). <br />	2005-03-01

Gorky Park has the plot and trappings of a modern thriller, but the ennui and character depth of a classic. That Smith has been able to bring these two styles of writing into perfect harmony speaks of his status as a modern master.          Gorky Park follows a murder investigation conducted by Arkady Renko, a Moscow homicide investigator whose unremarkable exterior hides a steel core of resolve that drives him to the point of ruin, again and again.          Arkady is the soul mate of Hieronymous Bosch, the LAPD homicide investigator who is featured in the popular Michael Connely series. Fans of either author should automatically pick up the other; each series has the same appeal of a bone-weary old-school investigator who will stop at nothing to close his case, even if it means career (or actual) suicide.         Arkady is a fascinating character, full of sadness and mystery. Smith has many strengths, and number one on the list is imbuing his characters with a depth and realism that make us care about them intensely. Number two is evoking the peculiar atmosphere of Russian nationalism, at a time when even the diehard communists are starting to look over their shoulder at the advancing wave of global capitalism. Smith's third strength is dialogue; every sentence that Arkady utters is an iceberg, with volumes of hidden meaning submerged beneath the words.          These elements are sometimes portrayed bleakly, but there is also a sense of joy in these books. We admire Arkady, and laugh along with him at a world that doesn't always make sense. He is kind of like a nationalistic superhero, with a fierce Russian pride that extends to the Russian people, but not to the government. There is real pleasure to be had in watching Arkady do his job, his way.          The plot is a somewhat standard modern thriller, with a series of murders linked to a wealthy American fur trader. Anyone who likes crime procedure novels will enjoyseeing Arkady blend old school techniques with the sometimes woefully inadequate modern equipment at his disposal.          If you enjoy modern novels, but always feel a little guilty when reading them, I urge you to pick up this book. The pleasures are all there, but this book also has something to say about the human spirit, and you will be the better for having read it.	2005-03-01
332738:US	20422170	R2YDK2OISLRGK0	0688320155	174790179	Ramona the Brave	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Good place to start when reading Cleary	This might be the best of the Ramona and Beezus books, because it captures the mindset of a six year old so perfectly. Ramona is a girl who tries to be good, but sometimes can't stop herself from being bad. She is interested in things like her own special version of the letter Q, which she dolls up to look like a kitty, or making a paper slipper during recess.    While the Quimby girls remain blissfully oblivious of some of the weightier problems that real life children might have to face at home, Ramona is an interesting realistic character who children will feel a kinship with. Her tribulations at school with classmates are particularly relevant.     At 124 pages, the book is longer than most books targeted to this audience, but it will be a good challenge, and the chapters remain short and simple. If you're thinking of introducing a young reader to this prolific and popular author, this might be the best place to start.	2005-02-28

Rowling is the next Roald Dahl, but in my opinion, it's Louis Sachar all the way.          Holes is about a boy, Stanley Yelnats, who is sentenced to a juvenile reform institution in which the boys are expected to dig holes in the desert all day, every day. This forced labor has an ulterior motive; the falsely-nice Mr. Pendanski, the ornery Mr. Sir, and the fearsome female Warden are seeking a treasure that they suspect is buried in the area.          There are a lot of flashbacks in this book that bring together storylines involving Stanley's ancestors, all of whom have labored under a family curse brought about by a forgetful great-great grandfather in Europe. Sachar has a lot of fun bringing these disparate elements together, and in integrating a theme involving onions and peaches.          The flashbacks have the feel of a fairy tale; the current events are filled with hardship and wicked adults who seem to delight in abusing their charges.          Despite the bleak outlook that life seems to present to Stanley, he finds himself actually enjoying Camp Greenlake in a way, because it's the first time that he's ever made friends with his peers.          This is a book that accomplishes many goals simultaneously, and does it well. Entertaining, touching, funny and sad all at once, Sachar also moves us through a fairly complex plot with a master's touch.          This book is a guarantee. Anyone who picks it up and reads it will be delighted that they made the investment.	2005-02-28
334662:US	20422170	R1TBS4MYWKQENC	B0007EPHMU	23497803	Red Skelton's favorite ghost stories	Books	3	9	10	N	N	Humorous ghost stories	Famous standup comedian Red Skelton published this collection of ghost stories, and his selection contains several creepy tales, several poems, and several humorous sendups of traditional tales. There's a story that reads like it may have been the inspiration for Ghostbusters, and an amusing one about a man who is plagued by a pack of hobo ghosts who won't give him any peace. To me, the best story in the book is a five-page tale about a man who tells of being pursued through the jungles of India by a man-eating tiger.  <br /> <br />As a collection, this is kind of an odd one. Fans of horror and the supernatural might feel cheated by the lighthearted tone that most of the stories have, and fans of comedy can find something funnier than the rather broad humor.  <br /> <br />Despite this, I thought that the stories were generally entertaining and very accessible. I first read this book twenty years or so ago, as a preteen, and I found that I still remember some of the stories quite clearly. My memory isn't that good, so Skelton must hav done something right.  <br /> <br />Particularly good for younger readers who like ghost stories, but might not want to be burderened by a parade of gore. <br />	2005-02-27

Books	4	1	1	N	N	Solidly humorous adventure	This is not Gordon Korman's best early book, but it is still a very funny read, with a wacky cast of characters spending a month at a summer camp on a small island. Rudy and Mike, who have a Bruno and Boots kind of dynamic, are the only two kids who don't want to be there. The unathletic Mike doesn't take to the hearty atmosphere very well, and the antisocial Rudy refuses to allow himself to take pleasure in any activity that doesn't bring him closer to home.  <br /> <br />The two join forces to try to get out of camp, and this goal sets off a set of schemes that fail miserably. Facing a neverending stream of punishment work detail, and finding themselves at more and more odds with the other boys, the two come up with the most dramatic plan yet. Unfortunately, it will end in a bigger debacle than they can imagine. <br /> <br />This book transplants all of the familiar elements of the Bruno and Boots series from a boarding school to a summer camp. The change is nice, but there's not too much going on here that's new. Still, anyone who enjoys Korman's writing will find this an entertaining read, and his trademark humor is in abundance.  <br />	2005-02-27
335027:US	20422170	R26F702QDEXPBP	0380709554	500357671	Ribsy (Henry Huggins)	Books	4	20	20	N	N	Welcome departure for Cleary, good story	Ribsy gets into the wrong car at a shopping center, and soon finds himself lost, far away from Henry Huggins and no idea of how to get home. He undergoes a series of adventures, almost all of them related to encounters with people from different walks of life who treat him in different ways. A desperate Henry keeps searching, but as time passes, it seems that the two might never be reunited.  <br /> <br />This is a very different book for Cleary. Not only is she writing about things from Ribsy's perspective, but she also wanders into the homes of several people who are fundamentally different from wholesome Huggins and Quimby families. Letting us see people who want to use Ribsy for their own ends gives us a glimpse into human nature that doesn't come through in the Ramona books.  <br /> <br />These differences make this book stand out from the other Cleary books, and I really enjoyed it as a child. There are some quirky and imaginative adventures in store for Ribsy, and it's easy to get invested in the desires of the dog and the boy, who just want to find each other and be happy together.  <br /> <br />This is one of the best books from among Cleary's early work, and I recommend it for anyone who might not be interested in her other books.  <br />	2005-02-27

Henry tries scheme after scheme, but nothing works, and then matters go from bad to worse when a boy genius moves into the neighborhood and picks up the route that Henry wanted. Henry is confounded by this development, but finds that he is better than the genius at one thing: dealing with Ramona, who is determined to sabotage the route at any cost.  <br /> <br />Since Henry Huggins first rode his bicycle onto the scene fifty years ago, the world has moved on, making his aw-shucks manner and quaint problems seem antiquated and distant from your savvy modern pre-teen.  <br /> <br />That being said, the stories are still amusing for young readers, and some of the elements, such as dealing with young pests, are universal. If you like other books by Beverly Cleary, this one will go down nicely, and if you're a boy thinking of giving Cleary a try, you might feel more comfortable starting with this one, which features a boy protagonist (although I think all of the books appeal to both genders). <br />	2005-02-26

In addition to battling the elements and hunger, Speed must face the challenges of human hunters and his own bastard son, Loafer, a half-wolf determined to kill him at the behest of his human owners.  <br /> <br />This is simple, straightforward prose that paints a realistic portrait of life from a wolf's point of view. I'm a little surprised that we don't get a look at Speed as a pup; we join him in his second or third year, after he has already chosen a mate and learned about the harsh world around him. <br /> <br />Books like this are fun in the same way that a western is fun; the action is realistic, exciting, and not mired in a convoluted plot. I would recommend it as a light snack for adults; younger readers who like books about animals will also be thrilled.  <br />	2005-02-26

In the _Dr. Dolittle_ books, Lofting has created a series with no weak links, and this entry, in which circumstances force Dr. Dolittle to take over the management of a traveling circus,  is as entertaining as could be.<br /><br />  Dolittle needs to raise some money to send a dear friend back to his African jungle home, and he reluctantly agrees to participate in a circus in order to raise the money. The ordinarily mild-mannered Doctor becomes righteously indignant when he sees the maltreatment of the circus animals by the ringmaster, an unsavory Mr. Blossom. When Blossom steals away into the night with everyone's money, the good doctor takes on the challenge of running the circus, the Dolittle way. Lofting has fun showing us the details of a utopian traveling circus from the animal's point of view.<br /><br />  By unveiling the cruelty that circus animals endure, Lofting shines a spotlight on a problem that still exists (to a lesser extent) today. At the time that this book was published, circus conditions were truly barbaric, and Lofting has done a great public service without sacrificing a smidgen of the wit and charm that his books are known for.<br /><br />  The Doctor Dolittle books are a magic blend of entertainment, fantasy, morality, and scientific method. Children who are exposed to these elements will be the better for it. And the books are so good that getting the entire series will become a top priority.<br /><br />  I recommend this book as highly as any children's book out there.<br /><br />  As a side note, please don't take the mediocre Eddie Murphy movies as indicative of this series. They have nothing to do with these fine books.	2005-02-26

John is a handsome, overly-confident prankster, while Lorraine is a shy, brainy girl. They both have family problems, and the book is really as much about them as it is about \\"the Pigman.\\"  <br /> <br />Teenaged readers will enjoy reading about kids who are somewhat like themselves, and reading the book in their own voices. The pranks that John pulls are really funny, even if they eventually get him into trouble, and seeing Mr. Pignati through their initially distrustful eyes makes us get to know him by degrees, and appreciate who he is. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a fun book that may spark an interest in reading. Zindel has a real knack for getting inside the heads of his young protagonists, and he has a very authoritative anti-authoritarian voice, if that makes any sense.  <br />	2005-02-25

Phule is backed by nearly limitless financial resources, and his insistence on prioritizing a mission-accomplished over the army's conservative regulations brings him in direct conflict with his superiors, who are annoyed by his priveleged background and want nothing more than to see him fail in a big way.  <br /> <br />This book is written in a very lighthearted manner, and brings out all sorts of stereotypical characters who are subjected to Aprin's own sly brand of humor. Asprin hasn't departed from his myth series as much as one might assume. While he's jumped from medieval to interstellar, the central idea (reworking time-honored plots while a bad-news-bears team of misfits triumphs against all odds) remains the same.  <br /> <br />Something about this book lacks the heat of the early Myth books. The character of Phule is less sympathetic than Skeeve, perhaps because he possesses both confidence and money in abundance, which undercuts his underdog status. There's also the fact that technology is never going to be as fun as magic.  <br /> <br />I feel like Asprin lost his way a bit toward the end of the Myth series, and just went in the wrong direction when trying to recapture the freshness and originality that the early Myth books provided in abundance.  <br /> <br />Despite these complaints, Phule's Company is the kickoff to an amusing series, and Asprin's ability to make us chuckle remains unchanged. The comedic bits, both subtle and broad, are well-done, and the action is exciting, if somewhat predictable.  <br />	2005-02-25

In this somewhat surreal fairy tale, modern sicknesses like HIV and modern issues like abortion make their appearance hand in hand with traditional elements, such as a genie who grants Weetzie three wishes.          Weetzie and a sometimes-strange set of characters with names like Dirk, Duck, and My Secret Agent Lover Man cruise through life; they take the tragedies that they must face in stride, yet avoid becoming numb to the pain around them.          There is a strong sense of love and strength among the oddball nontraditional family that eventually emerges. The book teaches us that the love of a family can support you through anything, and also that a family is defined by the love of the members rather than by blood ties or marriage vows.          This book is quirky and fun to read. Unlike most fiction written for young adults, it is relevant to the lives of urban youths without being preachy or depressing. Some readers might be turned off by the seemingly random departures from a traditional storyline, but others will love and cherish it as a book that is different, and that speaks to them.	2005-02-24

His appeal is his humor, which is sophiticated enough to appeal to jaded teens.  <br /> <br />     This book is full of that same quirky humor, which is embodied in the nonsensical poetry that is just obscure enough to sound \\"deep\\" and therefore avoid criticism: <br /> <br />Registration Day <br /> <br />On registration day at taxidermy school <br />I distinctly saw the eyes of the stuffed moose <br />Move. <br /> <br />     The plot revolves around Sean Delancey and his trouble-courting friend Raymond Jardine, who find themselves getting sucked in deeper and deeper in an attempt to bring an obscure dead author back to life. Seemingly innocent white lies compound, until they're forced to take drastic measures to avoid severe consequences. <br /> <br />     This book is good because the quirky characters and \\"prank\\" style action keep the pages turning, and the humorous writing doesn't get in the way of the interesting story. I wouldn't recommend that you make this your first Gordon Korman book (No Coins Please is probably a better place to start, depending on how old you are), but if you're a fan of his writing, this is another solid entry in his work. <br />	2005-02-24

It has the \\"violent killer on the loose\\" angle of a lot of modern thrillers, and the romance of a Harlequin (sans steamy sex scenes). It also has the feel of a traditional whodunit, with a limited cast of characters serving as suspects, and a bevy of carefully calculated plot twists and turns.<br /><br />I won't give away any plot details that others haven't already spoiled, but it's safe to say that it has the feeling of a modern young adult serial tv show, such as \\"Cold Mountain\\" or \\"Smallville.\\" The young adults are heroes, and their triumphs and tribulations are very character-centric and dramatic.<br /><br />I suppose I would say that this is a light, forgettable book that won't do much to improve your mind. However, it succeeds on the level of light entertainment, and might appeal to someone who hasn't cultivated a love of reading. It doesn't ask much of the reader, and the straightforward writing is clear, easy to follow, and enjoyably paced.<br /><br />If you are a young reader who was in love with a series like The Babysitter's Club, or The Three Investigators, this might be an ideal stepping stone to more adult reading.	2005-02-23

As a stand-alone novel, though, the extra length isn't justified in supporting the formulaic plot. <br /> <br />Not to say that this is a bad book; Pike does a good job of adapting the modern thriller and romance genres to a young teen audience in the same way that a slate of WB tv shows have mastered that sleek package.  <br /> <br />If you like Pike, you'll probably find this trilogy as good as his other novels. If you don't, this one won't change your mind any. If you're about to give this author your attention for the first time, I would recommend Chain Letter, which is a much better example of how good he can be. <br />	2005-02-23

Pike works within a strict formula that involves a whodunit, attractive young protagonists, and a thrilling sense of danger. In this particular outing, these elements are bolstered by a stronger-than-average set of characters, and above all the nifty idea that a chain letter is making demands that must be met.<br /><br />This book could have served as the inspiration for \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\\" and shares that movie's premise of a shared horrible secret that comes back to haunt the young beautiful friends who left a man for dead.<br /><br />Pike has a knack for moving a story along in the manner of a conventional thriller novel, and this book is extra exciting because of the gimmick of overt threats and unspeakably horrible demands.<br /><br />By playing on an Urban Legend, Pike has tapped into something that hits a little closer to home than most of his works.<br /><br />If you're going to give Pike a try, this is the book to cut your teeth on.	2005-02-23

And oh, it seems that one of them is a murderess. <br /> <br />Pike does a good job in this one, sticking to his by-the-numbers formula involving attractive teens, plot twists designed to throw suspicion on everyone but the murderer, and a paranoid feeling that the muderer walks among us.  <br /> <br />It may not be original, especially when measured against Pike's other books from the same period, but at least he does it well, moving us from point A to point B without a pause to catch our breaths.  <br /> <br />Young adults will like the way that this novel has been tailored to suit their culture (pop culture, that is), and while it may not educate anyone about the real world, it's a pleasant diversion. And hey, you're reading, so that's good. <br />	2005-02-23

As Colin tries scheme after scheme to rid himself of the Grollican, his young son Ian tries to befriend the wicked one who has come into their midst.  <br /> <br />This book is, in a word, awesome. Every chapter will delight a young reader by introducing an element of the supernatural or containing a big action secquence. I've never read another book like this, which gives such a wonderful modern voice to such ancience scottish sensibilities. The closest I can come for comparison's sake is \\"The Last Unicorn,\\" by Peter Beagle. But this book is even better because it never surrenders to the impulse to let the modern plot overshadow the magic of the fairy-tale roots. <br /> <br />I am shocked to see that this charmer is so unknown. If you are looking for something different to give a young reader, something that will engage them and given them a captivating glimpse into another world, this is the book for you. <br />	2005-02-22

She tells herself and everyone else that she will do a variety of productive tasks tomorrow, including fixing her broken television, mopping up some melted ice cream from the floor, and helping Elephant with his laundry. In the end, she follows a delicious smell to a party, which she wasn't invited to because she was taking it easy today. She concludes that she can attend the party, and take it easy tomorrow instead. <br /> <br />     These books are fun, with vivid bright colors that make each page seem shiny and new. I think children might feel a little sorry for Goose, who seems unable to do anything, and whose house is basically a pigsty. But mostly they will like to see the different animals who exhibit different traits interacting with each other.  <br /> <br />     There's a cautionary lesson about procrastination in the book, and we can all see the consequences of letting the Goof-Off Goose inside run the show.  <br /> <br />     The Sweet Pickles series as a whole was a big hit in my childhood home, and children will be eager to get more books in the collection. One of the best things about the series are the inside covers; the inside front cover has a picture of all 26 animals and their names, with each animal saying or doing something that displays their behavior. The inside back cover has a diagram of the Sweet Pickles town that lists which buildings are occupied by which characters. It's a touch that really makes the community come to life, and children will see a strong connection between the books. <br />	2005-02-21

Books	5	7	7	N	N	They don't get any better than this	This is one of the best picture books, ever. Grover would like to play hide and seek with the listener, but he has very limited hiding options, as he is caught within the confines of the pages of the book you are holding. He tries everything from coloring the pages blue to making a lot of speech balloons to hide behind, but his presence is always obvious. He gets increasingly deperate to find a good hiding place as the listener outs him time after time. In the end, he resorts to begging the listener to pretend that he can't be found, and then thanks the listener joyously, ending with a warm \\"you are my best friend.\\" <br /> <br />     This book is so inventive and fun that it's unbelievable. By making the child an active participant in the game, there's not a moment when the listener will feel left out, and the empowerment of being able to find Grover again and again is immeasurable. In the end, the listener learns a lesson about how to make someone else happy, even if it means bending the rules of the game a little, which is a great thing to teach kids.  <br /> <br />     The illustrations are also terrific, featuring lots of cute details that make it seem like Grover is inhabiting the book (such as drawn tears and creases in the page). <br /> <br />     This is a book that will bring you and your child closer together for hours of fun. I highly recommend it, along with Oscar's Book, Grover and the Everything in the Whole Wide World Museum, and There's a Monster at the End of this Book (which also stars Grover). <br />	2005-02-21

When a woman is about to cook a turnip, the turnip speaks to her, telling her to leave it alone. When the cat, her spoon, and the floor itself all begin to talk to her, the terrified woman runs from her hut in a panic. When she comes upon a woodcutter and tells him her story, his axe speaks to him, and the woman and the woodcutter both run off together. In the end, three citizens go to the king and tell him of their experiences, and he tells them to stop making up lies. After they leave, dejected, the crown on the king's head speaks to him. <br /> <br />This book has the feel of a fairy tale (and reappears from time to time as a joke about chatty horses who are astonished by a talking dog), with a repetitive structure that involves added elements with each retelling. It's also kind of eerie, with adults being clearly very frightened by spooky encounters that ultimately have no explanation. With the lack of a neat resolution, the reader is left to wonder what set off the phenomenon, and what will happen after the citizens return to their lives.  <br /> <br />But don't let these darker elements stop your children from enjoying the book, which is absorbing and illustrated by the celebrated and masterful Paul Galdone. I think having a bit of a ghost in your story can provide extra thrills for youngsters, and anyone who is old enough to understand that the events are spooky should also understand the humor and light-hearted elements of the book.  <br /> <br />This is a very young version of \\"What if;\\" in this case, what would you do if objects started to speak on their own.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book as an introduction to fairy tales and folk tales. <br />	2005-02-21

By drawing on historical documents, including a range of journals kept by the crew members, Bergreen is able to provide all the details one could ask for, and he frequently digresses from the adventure to give colorful background information, as when he describes the disease of scurvy, or the common misconceptions that sailors of the day held about the world beyond their borders. <br /> <br />Magellan himself is presented as a complex and conflicted character, whose cruelty towards his crew and some natives is not only described, but explained (if not forgiven).  <br /> <br />This has all of the excitement and motion of a gripping novel; Bergreen has a gift for ferreting out the most interesting information to paint a graphic picture of the lives of the sailors at sea.  <br /> <br />On the down side, I have to say that the final chapters in the book, which deal with the aftermath of the adventure, was a little too detailed for my tastes. I did want to know what happened, but I would have preferred broader strokes than the ones Bergreen chose. The most powerful, and long lasting images of the book deal with Magellan's final days; everything that follows is a denouement. <br /> <br />Even if you're not a history buff, I highly recommend this book. It is as thrilling as a novel, and will make you look at the lives of those who have come before us in a new way. <br />	2005-02-21

Each friend has individually come up with the idea to bring a package of popcorn, and after having some fun at the party, someone gets the idea to pop all of the popcorn together in a big black kettle. <br /> <br />The popcorn soon fills the house, and the young bears spend the rest of the night eating popcorn in order to fix the problem. After Sam cleans up, his parents return home with a gift for him-popcorn. <br /> <br />I liked this story a lot when I was a boy; it's fun to see the different costumes of the young bears and the different varieties of popcorn they bring (a bear dressed like a ghost has \\"spooky tooth\\" popcorn). The idea of a house being completely filled with popcorn is exciting (later recreated in the movie Real Genius), and the cartoonish illustrations provide a strong visual.  <br /> <br />I'm not sure that this book is particularly instructive or informative, but it is very fun, and I think most children would come back to it time and again. <br />	2005-02-21

George mistakenly eats a jigsaw puzzle piece, thinking that it might be candy. When his stomach starts to hurt the next morning, the Man in the Yellow Hat takes him to the hospital. What follows is a very detailed account of all the things that a child might expect to encounter while undergoing a simple surgery. George encounters everything from xrays to shots to a somewhat painful recovery as he sets up residence for a couple of days in the children's ward.  <br /> <br />     There is some excitement toward the end, as George commandeers a go-cart and crashes into a dining cart (in front of the visiting mayor, no less), but the emphasis is definitely on the workings of a hospital from the perspective of a young patient.  <br /> <br />     As a young child, I enjoyed some of the imagery in this book, such as the jigsaw puzzle and a puppet show that George puts on for the child patients using all four limbs at once. The illustrations are very good as always. <br /> <br />     Other books in this series are nothing special, in my opinion, but I thought that this book provided a great example for children who might be worred about a visit to the doctor or hospital. This is a good read for any child, and a must-read for a child with a visit to the hospital in the future. <br />	2005-02-20

After years of work, Hans is rewarded with a lump of gold. But while carrying the heavy lump homeward, he trades it for a horse. Then he keeps trading down, rom horse to cow, from cow to pig, and so on, until he winds up with a grindstone that falls into the bottom of a well.<br /><br />It's clear that the people Hans meets are taking advantage of him, but this is still a happy story, as Hans himself is thrilled with each trade, and is even ecstatic when the burdensome stone falls into the well. His naïve buoyancy is uplifting, and may teach a lesson on perspective.<br /><br />This is a good introduction to fairy tales for children, and the illustrations are terrific, with bright colors and interesting characters. I definitely recommend this book for young people.	2005-02-20

The Man in the Yellow Hat  takes him away from his jungle, and George gets himself into trouble during his travels to a Spanish zoo. He falls overboard on a ship, accidentally phones the fire department from the Man in the Yellow Hats' home, and is thrown into prison. He eventually escapes from prison and finds the Man in the Yellow Hat, who takes him to the zoo, where he is supposedly very happy.<br /><br />When I was a boy, my interest in these books was not that strong. The plot is fairly entertaining, and the pictures are very well done, but there's not much to set it apart from other books that have been published in the following decades. I think that the books might be so popular more because they were a pioneer in the field than because they possess any particular intrinsic charm.<br /><br />In my mind, other books in this series are better written, and reading the plot of this one leaves me a little cold now. George is basically kidnapped from his jungle home, and thrown in prison. The motivations of the Man in the Yellow Hat aren't stated, and I'm not sure why he felt the need to transport George to the zoo, unless there was a profit motive. Also, Rey passes up a chance to educate an American audience about Spain; while the pictures have some European flourishes, the average American child will assume that George is, in fact, in the US.<br /><br />This is not a bad book, but there are other books out there that do a better job of informing, entertaining, and providing a good example for, children. If, for reasons of sentimentality or tradition, you don't feel right about depriving your child of this cultural icon, I would get a different book in the series.	2005-02-20

Riding the bike in front of their home leads George into a series of adventures that take him further and further from home. He starts off by helping the newspaper boy to deliver papers, and then becomes involved in floating paper boats down a little stream. After his bicycle is damaged in an accident, a traveling circus meets George and allows him to participate in their show for the night. While at the circus, he accidentally feeds an ostrich a bugle, and then redeems himself by tracking down and retrieving an escaped bear cub.    This book is a better than the series opener, and has the added bonus of including fairly detailed instructions on how to make a paper boat out of an old newspaper. The watercolor-style pictures are engaging, and the plot keeps moving along in unpredictable ways that should keep the interest of most children.     While I'm not a huge fan of this series, this is a decent book that should appeal to most kids.	2005-02-20

It is much closer to the original grim fairy tales in that it has something of a sense of menace and danger about it, and also lacks the now-requisite happy ending.  <br /> <br />It tells the story of a fisherman who earns the favor of a magic fish through his own good-heartedness. He has no thought of reward, but his wife convinces him to ask the fish to upgrade their hut to a house, which the fish seems happy to do. But then the wife continues to convince the fisherman to go ask the fish for upgrades, until she is Queen of the land and wants to be Queen of the Sun and the Stars.  <br /> <br />Every time the fisherman goes to ask the fish for something else, the sea is stormier, although the fish says nothing. In the end, the fish decides that the wife has asked for too much, and takes away everything.  <br /> <br />There is so much going on in this story that a child can enjoy it for years. The characters and their relationship to each other provide for an instructive discussion about why we do favors, and why we should be reasonable in our requests. It also tells us a lot about what it takes to be happy.  <br /> <br />The repetitive nature of the plot should also be comforting to children. <br /> <br />I really recommend the 1967 edition, which was masterfully illustrated by Ed Arno.

This is an extremely funny and engaging book, buoyed by the enthusiastic character of Grover and a variety of different situations that will be both instructive and humorous for a young child.  <br /> <br />Grover is walking through the various rooms of the \\"Everything in the Whole Wide World Museum,\\" and every room contains a category of objects, such as \\"Things so Loud that You Cannot Hear Yourself Think.\\" In every room, the objects are neatly labeled, so this will be a great vocabulary builder for your toddler. But Grover finds himself in different situations within the museum that make each page unique, and not just a word list. There's even a room of things that tickle, which gives you the opportunity for a tickling session with your listener. <br /> <br />This book just flows extremely well, in my opinion, and I remember that it was a big hit in our home when I was a toddler. Along with -Oscar's Book- and -There's  a Monster at the End of This Book- (which also features Grover), this is part of a trio from the Sesame Street gang that represents the pinnacle of what picture books are all about: interaction, humor, and learning. <br />	2005-02-19

When the cake is ready to be eaten, they all want to help, but the hen eats the cake by herself. In the end, the lazy trio has learned to help with the household chores.  <br /> <br />This is a nice simple story with a good rhythm and refrain (Not I! said the dog; Not I! said the cat; Not I! said the mouse) that should be very reassuring to a young child. The pictures in my 1974 edition (also by Galdone, I guess, since no illustrator is credited) are very nice, with lots of details to think about and enjoy. The moral is a good one for young children to learn as well.  <br /> <br />This book has endured through the years because it has all of the elements that make a great kid's book; it is entertaining and comforting, teaches children where food comes from, and contains a lesson about the value of a day's work.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend it.  <br />	2005-02-18

Uber-realistic dialogue, complete with cursewords and contemptorary cultural references. Blood, guts, and more blood and guts. A small northeastern town town by a sinister presence. Good versus evil. Child heroes, and adult heroes. Vivid descriptive language and a plot that keeps moving. For all that, this book is not King's most enjoyable, and I would recommend that someone new to King's work pick up something more popular, and save this for somewhere in the middle.  <br /> <br />The reemergence of Father Callahan in the final two gunslinger books makes it known that King himself finds this work to be an important piece of his life's work, and it is actually a very good take on vampires, mixing elements of folklore with a more realistic and modern setting.  <br /> <br />Despite my criticisms, I don't want anyone to think that this is a bad book. King is miles ahead of the pack when it comes to fleshing out a world, and then goosebumping out the flesh. You will get thrills and chills from this novel, especially if you read it alone at night.  <br /> <br />But if you're new to King, revel in the fact that you can measure his work against a stick a mile high, and that this is somewhere in the middle. If you're already a fan of King, this is a classic and typical example of King's early work.  <br />	2005-02-18

Look no further.  <br /> <br />A Chicago family moves into a small town in Maine. Near their home, there is a patch of land that even the Native Americans used to think was evil, and which brings about a sense of foreboding even now. Near that land, there is a \\"Pet Sematary,\\" where the children of the town traditionally bury their pets. There's an older neighbor who warns that the cursed land is best avoided. There's also a lonely highway that goes past their new home, upon which massive trucks build up dangerous levels of speed.  <br /> <br />These elements are scary in their own right, but the kicker is that when living things are buried in the cursed ground, they come back. And when they come back, they are different, and different in a bad way. Depending on how much time has passed between their death and their burial, they might be near-normal, or completely evil. In all cases, they bear a whiff of the grave about them like an earthy shroud.  <br /> <br />This is just a great scary book, and we really come to love the characters, and agonize over the decisions that they are confronted with. It is depressing, even shockingly depressing in parts, but I still have to recommend it wholeheartedly.  <br /> <br />King employs one of his trademark devices here to great effect, and that is that he first gives you some second or third-hand accounts of supernatural phenomena occuring that sound very believable. This not only sets the reader up to believe in the supernatural phenomena as they are happening, but it also enhances the sense of wonder as we personally come into contact with something that we have heard about before in legends.  <br /> <br />I would say that this book is almost too brutal and heartbreaking for it to serve as an introduction into King's work. In so many of his works, we are treated to a battle between the forces of good and evil. But in Pet Sematary, good seems to have taken a vacation,leaving us with a battle between evil and not-up-to-the-task. <br /> <br />If you've already gotten used to how terrifying King can be, then I recommend this book to experience the depths of his depravity.  <br />	2005-02-18

While she is gone, Mr. Muddle stops in for a visit and makes himself a cup of tea, inadvertently rearranging her kitchen in the process. When she returns, Little Miss Neat is exasperated to find everything in the wrong place, and she talks to Mr. Muddle and figures out what happened.<br /><br />This is a straightforward, simple book that children should be able to follow and enjoy. The series is similar to the Sweet Pickles books, in that it revolves around characters who exhibit certain traits, but I think that the simpler illustrations in this series might fail to hold the interest of a child young enough to enjoy the story.<br /><br />You might buy a single book in this series to see if it clicks for your child, but I wouldn't go crazy on the investment unless it's something that he or she really enjoys. In my opinion, there are better books out there, whether you're looking for a book that's entertaining, informative, or morally instructive.	2005-02-18

Cousin Dinky is the only small person who moves from family to family freely, and he gets the ball rolling when he suggests a meeting of small families. Lucy and Tom want so desperately to meet other children their own size that a trip is arranged, despite the dangers that the outside world presents.  <br /> <br />This book capitalizes on the elements that make the series a success, by presenting realistic obstacles posed by a giant world. The differences between the Littles and the Specks is fascinating, and the interaction between the small people and potentially fierce animals is exciting as well.  <br /> <br />Buy this series for your child, and let him or her go from beginning to end for some good, clean entertainment that will keep them reading until the last page has been turned.  <br />	2005-02-18

In this prequel to the Chronicles of Narnia, we get to see everything from the origin of the lamp-post that Lucy encounters upon first entering Narnia to the debut of Aslan, as he grants the animals of Narnia the gift of speech.          I strongly recommend that you not read this book until you have finished the first five volumes in the series. It is good as a stand-alone story, but the real magic is discovering the answers to questions that may have occured to you while reading the other books.          Digory and Polly find themselves in a nexus between worlds, and travel from our world to Narnia and back again. They also venture into other magical worlds, and inadvertently bring trouble home with them in the form of an angry goddess.         Digory is trying to help his sick mother, but also finds other demands being placed on him. As in all of the Narnia stories, great burdens are borne by young children, and only those who are up to the task at hand can find happiness.         This book is every bit as magical as the others, and also brings back a note of familiarity for those who became distressed when the original foursome became less prominnently featured. By returning to its roots, Lewis is able to both play on feelings of nostalgia, and to amaze us with the presentation of a creation myth as it happens.          Any fan of the series will remember this volume fondly, and will likely use this book as a springboard to begin rereading the earlier books. I can't recommend this book, or this series, more highly. It has earned and will continue to earn a place in the hearts of children, and I can only hope that the upcoming big-budget movie will rejuvenate the series' popularity in the same way that the Lord of the Rings movies generated an interest in that series.	2005-02-17

Narnia is a land where animals speak and the snow never ceases. In fact, it's been snowing since the land fell under the evil influence of the White Witch, who is a cruel and ruthless ruler. The good citizens of Narnia wish for Aslan, the great lion, to return and banish the witch forever. But before he can return, it is prophesied, four human children must come to Narnia to help them.  <br /> <br />     There's just something about the writing in this that sucks you right in, and Lewis spares no effort to wrench both tears and laughter from us, succeeding on both counts. He manages to create a sense of awe and sanctity for the special things in Narnia, and there is just no protecting yourself from the immediacy that this book offers.  <br /> <br />     We also get a real feel for Edmund, the least well-liked of the four children, and come to feel a special sense of regret for the choices that he makes, even while understanding that we ourselves make those same types of choices.  <br /> <br />     While the book can be read as a biblical allegory, those who are not religious (or who follow other faiths) need not worry about exposing their children to something that they don't believe in. I probably read this entire series at least half a dozen times, and never once realized that the allusions are even there. It's just a beautiful, and wonderful story that transcends faiths.  <br /> <br />     If for some reason you had to choose just one series of books to read as a child, I would recommend that this series be your choice. Other series do a better job of instilling a sense of curiosity, or of realistically portraying young protagonists, but no other series can do a better job of transporting a childto a magical place.  <br />	2005-02-17

These two clans have an irrational distrust of each other, and the Littles get caught up in their struggles just when they desperately need to be focused on the pregnancy of Mrs. Little.  <br /> <br />The elements that make the series consistently great are also on full display. The little people are essentially living in isolated pockets in the vast and dangerous frontier created by humans, and they must rely on their own wits to carve out a decent living. The problems they face, and the solutions that they struggle to find, are amazingly realistic, and there is no need to create evil-minded villains when the terrain is so inhospitable. Seeing the other clans in action also shows that the methods of living life on such a small scale can be very localized; the Specks, who live in the trunk of a tree, have an entirely different way of life than the Littles.  <br /> <br />This is a charming series, with hundreds of thoughtful details that will delight children with their ability to portray a real world. Interactions with housecats and toy gliders are particularly thrilling.  <br /> <br />Also, I would be remiss not to mention the wonderful sepia-toned drawings by Roberta Carter Clark. They mirror the text's adherence to realism, and give us a very graphic and fun look at the scenes that the text describes.  <br />	2005-02-17

In the genre of The Last Unicorn and The Princess Bride, this beautiful story takes you into a peaceful world where a lonely hunter lives by the sea.  <br />     The story follows the hunter's efforts to make a family for himself, and to keep that family safe. I don't want to spoil any of the plot points, but I will say that this gentle fable is going to fill each reader with joy and contentment. The tale is universal, and is just perfect for a shared experience at bedtime.  <br />     The decorations by Maurice Sendak are also quite lovely, giving us detailed sketches of the landscapes that the hunter and his family occupy. <br />	2005-02-16

Doc Raccoon is the storyteller, and he tells us about a giant flood that caused himself, a bullfrog, a snake, a fox, and a rabbit to all pull together to try to set things right.  <br /> <br />The animal characters are rather plain, most of them exemplifying a particular attribute (such as the sneaky and self-serving fox), but the story is so entertaining and satidfying that the plot is what makes this book tick. The animals come up with plan after plan, and in each we get a glimpse of the proud tradition of southern folk tales, sans racist overtones.  <br /> <br />There is a unique chatty tone to the narrator's voice that does indeed remind one of Mark Twain's frame story narratives. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this charming set of books for any child who likes fairy tales or books about talking animals.  <br />	2005-02-15

The repetition of the phrases and the funny little stories with accompanying pictures make for an ideal bedtime read.

Deeply sorry.'        `Quite all right.' said the Sea Monster stiffly.        `Yes,' the Phoenix continued, `we both know that you have passed through perilous times, through dangers which (I must confess) would have left me a shattered wreck.'       The Sea Monster sighed sadly, but its whiskers were beginning to rise again.\\"         David has just moved with his family to a new home at the base of a mountain, and he can't wait to explore its heights. While wandering the mountain, he comes upon the Phoenix, a man-sized bird who loves cinnamon and mangles his latin studies. While the Phoenix resists the idea, he soon agrees to give David lessons in life.          This is a great story, because much of it is lighthearted and silly, but then suddenly a very forbidding element enters in the form of the Scientist, who is intent on capturing the Phoenix for his own evil purposes. The book is unexpectedly bittersweet, which makes it very gripping emotionally.          The language is clean and crisp, and the author obviously has fun with the stodgy old bird who uses british phraseology and is comically indignant whenever he is offended.           Another nice touch is the chapter names, which are teasers for what is to come. For example, one chapter is \\"8, In Which David and the Phoenix Visit a Banshee, and a Surprise is Planted in the Enemies Camp.\\" I wish all children's authors would include names for their chapters; when I was a boy, I distinctly preferred them, as they just seemed to add a bit of flavor to the text.         This is a great read that any young reader will enjoy.	2005-02-14

But the idea of a vampiric bunny  that freaks out the established household pets (Chester the cat, Harold the dog, and now Howie the dachshund puppy) can only be taken so far, especially if the mute bunny never actually seems to do any harm. I really enjoyed the first book, thought of the second book as a decent sequel, and found this book to just be more of the same.  <br /> <br />The humor is very broad, mostly revolving around the silliness of the main characters, who misinterpret harmless situations to mean that Bunnicula is on a rampage. Their earnestness is sometimes appealing, but they are hard to find an emotional connection with.  <br /> <br />I think that most readers will see the plot points coming from a mile away. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to Bunnicula fans, but there are too many terrific books out there for the casual reader to spend time on this one.  <br />	2005-02-14

But listen, everybody. I've just had a funny thought...\\" <br /> <br />     This magical sequel picks up where Charlie and the Chocolate Factory left off, with Charlie bursting through the top of the Wonka factory in a flying glass elevator. After a quick stop to pick up Charlie's family, they fly off into space, eventually finding themselves in conflict with the White House and with a race of hungry space aliens.  <br /> <br />     This book is not quite as grounded as the first one; since it starts off flying around in an elevator, we know right off that this won't be a very realistic tale. But Dahl really pours on the humor and the thrills, which keeps us turning the pages as quickly as we can.  <br /> <br />     We return to more familiar ground later in the book, when Charlie's family returns to the chocolate factory and find it to be every bit as thrilling and dangerous as their encounters in space.  <br /> <br />     I believe that this is the only sequel Dahl ever wrote, and I wish all sequels were as good as this one. On the one hand, he does seem to fall a bit into the trap of making things bigger and better in the hopes that it will make up for the sheer originality of the first book. On the other hand, the book is far more bizarre than the first one, and at times takes on an eerie surreality akin to The Phantom Tollbooth.  <br /> <br />     It's hard to find a more entertaining character than Willy Wonka, who is fiercely cheerful and unpardonably rude, but always to those who deserve it. It's not many characters who can seemingly take pleasure from the act of annoying a trio of bedridden octagenarians and come out of it with more goodwill than he went in with.  <br /> <br />     Dahl has a talent for children's books unlike any other author. That talent is on full display here, and this book is as highly recommended as his other works.  <br />	2005-02-14

But after the movie was released (and a movie remake will be released later this year), it is certainly his best-known book, and it deserves every bit of the attention its received.  <br /> <br />Charlie Bucket is the only child in a family that's so poor that they all look forward to Sunday, when he, his parents, and his four grandparents all get an extra serving of cabbage soup. Charlie's life takes a turn for the better when he, along with four other children from around the world, wins a ticket that allows him entrance into the magical and mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory. Wonka has been turning out delicious treats for decades from behind a complete veil of secrecy, and the guided tour is receiving international media coverage. Once inside, Charlie, the other four children (each of whom is nasty in their own particular way), and their parents find that the factory is filled with both wonders and dangers that must be navigated by one who is pure of heart.  <br /> <br />This is a grand unveiling of all of the elements which mark Dahl's work. The imaginative storyline, the dark humor, the wacky rhymes and the strong identification with a good-hearted child protagonist are all in evidence. Readers who have grown up seeing the movie first might be surprised at some of the differences between the two; no movie made in the seventies could have possibly depicted some of the wonders that Dahl has dreamed up. <br /> <br />This wonderful book has become a staple of childhood, and no one should deprive their child of the fun that reading it will provide.  <br />	2005-02-13

And they love the idea of playing practical jokes on adults even more, particularly when the adult in question is temporarily brought down to the same level as the kid.  <br /> <br />     This was a favorite book of mine when it was first published because it perfectly brings those common child fantasies to life in a realistic manner. Pete is angry when he learns that his grandfather will be coming to live with him and will be taking over Pete's bedroom. After giving his grandfather an ultimatum, Pete declares war on his grandfather, and in this case war takes the form of an escalating series of pranks. Grandpa sees the war as an amusing diversion, and he responds in kind. But by the end of the book, both combatants find themselves trapped in a situation that they would rather avoid. <br /> <br />     This book artfully captures the dynamics of family relationships. Pete and his grandfather love each other, and yet their love is confused by the fights that they have. Kimmel-Smith does a great job of depicting the conflicted emotions that children feel for their family members.  <br /> <br />     I highly recommend this book to any young reader. It is a very entertaining read, and will be a pleasant way to pass an evening or two.	2005-02-13

There are many different types of word puzzles, but the title of this book refers to the type of puzzles represented by presenting the letters of a word in a way that suggests a phrase. For example:       de    cision        would be the puzzle, with the answer being \\"split decision.\\" Mager gets surprising mileage out of this concept, and some of the answers are much more elusive than you might think. <br /> <br />But at the end of the day, you're probably better off getting a book of word puzzles that represents a variety of types of puzzles, instead of this rather single-minded approach. <br />	2005-02-13

This book is every bit as entertaining as his earlier works, featuring a grand plan that unfolds nicely for the schemer. But there's no subversiveness, no violence, no disgusting bodily fluids or functions or anything of the kind. I quite liked it.     Esio Trot is the story of a man who is in love with the woman who lives beneath him. Every day, he pines for her as she fusses over the love of her life, a tortoise named Alfie. One day, he is struck with an idea as to how he can win her love-but he's going to need the tortoise to do it.    This is a gentle tale, but no less humorous than you would expect from Dahl. The feel-good nature is a pleasant change, and the idea of two older people courting has always been a source of warm fuzziness.    I highly recommend this entertaining and charming book. If you're a parent who is uncomfortable with letting your small child read some of his scarier books (a view I understand even if I don't agree with it), I especially recommend this story. With Esio Trot, you can let your child experience this magical author without having to worry about any objectionable bits.	2005-02-12

They're just like you and me, except for that they have furry tails. While living in the spaces between the walls of the Biggs, a normal-sized family, they always seem to run into some kind of trouble, and this book is no exception. There's a mysterious critter that seems to be running around the house, but no Little can get a bead on exactly what it is. A dangerous refrigerator and a housecat present some special challenges. And the entire time, a storm is brewing, a storm so big that it might threaten the Little's very existence.  <br /> <br />These are terrific little books for children, primarily because they're just so much fun to read. The Littles have to deal with a lot of problems that come about, not only because of their size, but because they don't have the types of support services that a larger community provides. In many ways, they're like a pioneer family on the strange frontier of a giant house.  <br /> <br />Author Peterson has taken full advantage of this situation, and the obstacles they encounter are always imaginatively presented and thrillingly solved. The characters employ good problem-solving techniques for the problems at hand.  <br /> <br />Don't let the mediocre movies about tiny people (the Borrowers, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Stuart Little) dampen your enthusiasm for this concept. Peterson's creations are more imaginative and better done than any of those films.  <br />	2005-02-12

James Trotter is the kind of boy whose life is so miserable that it makes me think Harry Potter should quit complaining about the Dursleys. James's legal guardians, Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker, are so cruel that they think nothing of administering a beating, or leaving James in the bottom of a well overnight.<br /><br />But young Trotter's life takes a turn for the better, or at least the more exciting, when he bobbles a bag of magical crystals that create a giant peach and a cast of enormous insects living inside it. Before long, James is on a wonderful adventure across the ocean, seeking happiness in a world that has been far too cruel to him to date.<br /><br />This is one of the best Dahl stories ever, ranking right up there with Danny Champion of the World and The BFG. The major plot turns and the tiny details are so well done that the reader is completely engrossed, from beginning to end. Scenes involving sharks and seagulls are thrilling, and the prose is littered with funny rhymes and songs that a child will enjoy hearing read aloud.<br /><br />My edition is illustrated by Nancy Ekholm Burkert, and I have to say that her drawings are some of the best I've ever seen in a children's book. I did enjoy the movie that came out a few years ago, but the book is better by far, so you might want to read the book first.<br /><br />This is a guaranteed good time for any reluctant child reader. It's also a great read for adults.	2005-02-12

What more can you ask for? <br /> <br />The Witches is a story about a young boy who lives with his cigar-smoking Norwegian grandmother, and who comes into conflict with the witches of the world. As he soon learns, witches don't ride about on broomsticks or wear tall pointed hats. In fact, they takes great pains to blend in with the rest of society, and only a knowledgeable observer can detect them via a series of clues about their appearance. The boy gets a crash course in witchery when he and his grandmother check into a hotel which, coincidentally, is hosting an annual meeting of the society of witches.  <br /> <br />This book has all of the Dahlisms that make this author so special. There are entertaining sub-stories that are fascinating in their own right, as when Grandmother relates her childhood experience with a witch. There are grand and daring plans that may or may not work out as the planner intends. Moreso than in other Dahl books, the villainesses are downright creepy, and a child who reads it may find him or herself surreptitiously checking out women for signs that they are witches.  <br /> <br />The inventiveness, the humor, and the excitement of this book come through on every page, and no child will be bored during this story. There's a feeling that Dahl and his child readers are collaborating on something magical, bold, and a little naughty, and this sense of camraderie conveys itself to the childhood readers. <br /> <br />Of all the Dahl books, this has to be one of the three or four best, and the ending, which isn't remotely tidy or ideal, may be shocking. The movie was kind of okay, but doesn't hold a candle to this exciting book.  <br /> <br />For entertainment purposes, I couldn't recommend it more. <br />	2005-02-11

After a particularly grueling encounter with the old bat which makes him frightened, George tries to think of a way to teach his grandmother a lesson. As with so many other Dahl protagonists, he hits upon a brilliant and daring plan. He decides to replace her medication with \\"Georges Marvelous Medicine,\\" which he makes by mixing up a witch's brew of household items. He knows that it's magical, but not what it will do. And that's when things get even more entertaining.  <br /> <br />Once again, Roald Dahl has created a masterpiece that will keep children enthralled by presenting a forbidden fantasy; in this case, taking revenge on a wicked, persecuting adult who seems protected by the envelope of invulnerability that adults seem to have.  <br /> <br />This is a very slim book, and even a casual young reader should be able to plow through it in one or two sittings. I remember that, after I read it for the first time as a boy, I coudn't put my finger on exactly what I had enjoyed so much. The plot is very simple, and I couldn't answer my own question. I finally just decided that I liked it all; every page and scene is entertaining. <br /> <br />Children and adults will love the humor that this book represents. While Dahl comes under fire from some parents, I feel that the tongue-in-cheek nature of the book makes itself known to children; in the same way that they know they can't throw a bucket of water on a wicked woman to melt her (ala The Wizard of Oz), they'll know that they can't be poisoning the unpleasant old people in their life. Above all, this is a fun story, and children will love to see the unpredictable effects of the magic brew that George creates.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br />	2005-02-11

There have been many fairy tale parodies in recent years, but this book stands out both because of the irreverence and the fact that each tale is told in rhyme.  <br /> <br />Only someone with Dahl's clout could publish a scene in which a little girl whips out a gun and kills her enemy, and only those who love Dahl will appreciate the dark humor that is his trademark.  <br /> <br />I found that the six stories were fun and entertaining, and I think that they would be better read aloud to children than read silently.  <br /> <br />Over the last fifty years, there has been a trend of removing anything objectionable from fairy tales, and I would remind critics that these stories are more in keeping with the rough and tumble spirit of the original tales by the Grimm brothers and others, than the Disneyfied versions that we find elsewhere. <br /> <br />Judged against other books by Dahl, I have to say that this is not his best children's work, since he is working off of familiar elements that are not entirely of his own creation. Also, the short lengths of the stories, and the imposition of the rhyme scheme might have prevented him from really exercising his imagination to the fullest extent.  <br /> <br />But in my book, Dahl on his worst day is better than most other children's authors on their best day, and any child who likes his more traditional books will enjoy the giggles that these offbeat tales can provide.  <br /> <br />	2005-02-11

Written for scoutmasters and their assistants, most of the book is a catalogue of games meant to instruct the scout on some point of conduct related to scouting. As a non-scout, I was still pleasantly surprised to see that many of the activities can be fully enjoyed by anyone who is interested in upright citizenship or the outdoors. This could be a handy pocket guide for someone looking to learn basic woods lore, or knot-tying, for example. The writing itself is pretty tortuous, with lots of clunky prose and even confusing sentences. But that shouldn't prevent an interested reader from skimming through and finding some fun activities to do with children or even adult friends on a camping trip.	2005-02-10

The language and typeface are easy to read, the simple illustrations are fairly well-done, and the facts themselves are very colorful.  <br /> <br />I do question the validity of some of the facts, such as the one asserting that \\"When the Vienna State Opera House was completed, in 1869, the criticism of it was so hard that one architect hanged himself and another died of shock,\\" or another asserting that kissing began when prehistoric mothers passed pre-chewed food into their babies mouths. <br /> <br />But I suppose that the point of the book is not to be accurate so much as entertaining and stimulating, and the book accomplishes that. As a child, I enjoyed reading the facts and then repeating them to family and friends; I suspect that other children would get pleasure in the same way, and that it would contribute to a general healthy thirst for knowledge. <br />	2005-02-10

It's difficult to put your finger on exactly what makes this series stand out from the hundreds of other books about children having magical encounters. The idea of having an unhappy boy leave a troubled home to spend time in an enchanted world isn't so incredible that it stands out from its peers. And given the premise of a wizardry school, all of the other charming elements (wizard professors, magical lessons, an evil foe better left unmentioned) seem almost automatic.<br /><br />And yet, these books have captured the hearts of millions, this in a time when a book is hard pressed to make itself known among all of the other types of attention-grabbing entertainment.<br /><br />I suppose the special magic of the Harry Potter series is the result of lots of little things done right. The dialogue is well done, sounding realistically British to my American ears.. The characters are well done, evoking emotion. The plot and pacing are well done, keeping us interested and turning pages even as new wonders are introduced for us to marvel at. Most of all, the little flourishes which flesh out the magical world are well done. Trading cards on which the pictures move. Goblins managing the bank vaults. The excitement of Quidditch, and the presitge associated with owning the most expensive model of broomstick. All of these touches are done in a way that seems very realistic, and there's a consistency within Harry's world which seems very realistic. The world of wizards is exactly like the world of Muggles, except that it has magic in it.<br /><br />The annual cycle of the school year is also perfect for a series, allowing a formula for comforting elements, but enough variety to make each book stand on its own.<br /><br />This first book sets up the series, and gives us a first glimpse at all of the characters that we will eventually come to love and hate. Harry, Hermione, Dumbledore, Hagrid, the Weasleys, Snape, Malfoy, the Dursleys, and you-know-who (among others) all make their first appearance to great effect.<br /><br />This series may not come up to the level of the classic greats, such as the Chronicles of Narnia, but it is immensely entertaining, and very much worth reading, for children and adults alike.all make their first appearance to great effect. <br /> <br />This series may not come up to the level of the classic greats, such as the Chronicles of Narnia, but it is immensely entertaining, and very much worth reading, for children and adults alike.  <br />	2005-02-10

Some of the stories will likely be familiar to you, such as Beauty and the Beast or Jack and the Beanstalk. But most are more obscure, including some traditional folk tales from Ireland, Scotland, and China.  <br />     The black and white illustrations are very well done, and interspersed with the text in an interesting way.

My main problem is that buying this collection won't replace the need to get the original books; the stories in here are wonderful, but it is an incomplete collecion, and any fan will want to read all of the stories. And yet, this book is the only place to get some of the supplemental \\"behind the scenes\\" information.          I think I liked it better when I could believe that every word was true as written, and that the stories were a faithful telling of Herriot's life. By allowing us to see the man behind the curtain, this book roots his stories in the real world, and thereby necessarily spoils the illusion that the books have maintained for so many readers for all of these years.          That being said, this book is a gorgeous compilation, full of rich, lush photographs of the Scottish countryside that Herriot so enjoyed, as well as interesting supplemental information. For example, there are line drawings and descriptions of many of the animal breeds and tools that Herriot mentions in passing. If you want to get a better idea of some nifty gadgets, including a turnip-cutter, a cake-crusher, and a horn trainer, then you will really enjoy this book.          There's no substitute for reading the series in chronological order, but this book can enrich that experience. Ideally, you would want to read all of the books, but refer to this tome when you hit a story that is included.          If you're a big fan, this is an ideal addition that can enhance your Herriot experience, but if you just want to read the stories as they were written, without the bells and whistles, stick with the novels.	2005-02-09

Throughout, we are reminded that the teller of a story takes ownership of that story, and can tinker with it as he or she sees fit.  <br /> <br />I found the stories themselves to be hit or miss, but they were generally of a high quality, including some real gems. Seeger begins with a selection of tales told to him by his father, and he ends with a handful of stories that he has invented himself. These two sections are particularly imaginative, and remind us all that we can pass on stories from generation to generation without money or interference from the outside world.   <br /> <br />If you have children and are open to the idea of reading them to sleep at night, this is a must-read. By learning how to tell a story more flexibly, you can turn that quality time into something even more special. <br />	2005-02-09

Other classics are no less fantastic, but for some reason never attained the iconic status that they deserve. This is that kind of classic, a quiet classic which is little-known, but still has that special ability to impact those who read it. <br /> <br />This book tells the life story of Tarka the Otter, who is born in the Devon countryside and faces the struggles that all otters must endure as they grow up, mate, and grow old. Tarka is the main character of the book, but the author refuses to anthropomorphize him, instead bringing us into an utterly realistic world of life, death, joy and loss, without pretending that otters can actually speak in anything approximating a human language.  <br /> <br />I've read other books that purport to show us the life of an animal in this way, but none of them bear the richness of detail and the feeling of authenticity that come with this novel. The author has such an intimate understanding of the particulars of Tarka's life that we are drawn into his world with a stunning immediacy. Every feature of the land is known from the ground up; every bend in the creek is lovingly described. The way that the land and the various organisms that populate it interact creates a breathtaking tapestry of life that puts most other nature writers to shame.  <br /> <br />The language, particularly the language used to describe the natural settings, is rich and exotic, making us appreciate the wonders of an unremarkable countryside setting in a new way. No matter how well read you are, this book will throw new words at you, and enrich your vocabulary. Turning to a random page, I see references to \\"a sandy rabbit-bury,\\" the \\"slot of deer,\\" an \\"old dismated ketch,\\" and \\"the frore air.\\" What a wealth of words, and yet the unfamiliarity doesn't prevent us from enjoying every poetic sentence.  <br /> <br />If you like to read about animals or appreciate nature, this is a book that will speak to you more profoundly and more eloquently than Thoreau, and which will allow you to appreciate the wonders of nature even moreso than the books of Bernd Heinrich.  <br /> <br />If you devote a little time to reading this book, you'll be rewarded out of all proportion to your investment.  <br />	2005-02-08

Most of the stories have an accompanying picture, but I can't say that the illustrations impressed me much. Some are very good, and others are not so good; while the artist is the same, there is no central unifying theme that ties the artwork together; in some of them, animals are anthropomorphized, while in others they are not. Each fable ends with the moral in italics, encouraging the reader to pause and give a moment's thought to the story that has just been read. The slimness of the volume might be appealing to young readers who would be intimidated by something more weighty.	2005-02-08

This is in the tradition of Encyclopedia Brown, The Mad Scientists' Club, Henry Reed, and the Great Brain books, and this book compares very favorably to most of the others I just mentioned.  <br /> <br />Alvin Fernald is a typical American boy (albeit, in a somewhat naive 1960s kind of a world) who is different from his peers in one important way: He has a Magnificent Brain (MB). What's charming about this is that Alvin doesn't actually seem to be a genius; he just has the willpower and the creativity to sit down and think logically about the problems that he encounters, often using a visualization technique to stimulate his mental juices. He is enthusiastic and confident, and knows that he can make great changes to the world if he applies himself.  <br /> <br />In this particular book, Alvin gets the idea to run a Swap Shop, in which customers can come and exchange an item with another in the store (an idea later ripped off in the Turtle Street Trading Company, by Jill Klevin).  As they build up stock by swapping for increasing numbers of items, they are sucked into a mystery involving Pim, a foreign boy on the run who enters their store because he is desperately hungry. In the end, Alvin's Magnificent Brain comes up with a plan that can save Pim.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br />	2005-02-08

But after reading this book on a whim, I have to say that I'm hooked. <br /> <br />Laura Ingalls and her family eke out a difficult living on the plains of Minnesota during the time of pioneers and native americans. They are a tightknit family focused on doing the right thing, but their closeness and morality are severely challenged by the harshness of prairie life. They battle floods, drought, fires, blizzards, and insect infestations, all while trying to earn enough money to work toward a better life. Laura and her sister Mary have their first experiences with church and with school, and have to try to fit in as country bumpkins among more street-smart peers (most notably the obnoxious and relatively rich Nellie Oleson).  <br /> <br />I found this book to be very charming. The unrelenting goodness of the entire Ingalls family is a bit tiresome at times, but the unflagging earnestness with which it is portrayed won me over, and I soon found myself completely invested in their happiness. The fact that they are happy with so little is refreshing, especially when viewed against the backdrop of modern times. The fact that it took place so long ago, and in such a harsh setting, actually made the good-hearted characters seem more believable.  <br /> <br />But what really sells this book is the authentic portrayal of the way of life that the Ingalls' live.  Living in a dugout by a creek, cutting the grass to make hay, and knitting clothes during long and dreary days; the book's colorful details make a practically-extinct lifestyle come alive. In particular, the way that the Ingalls must observe nature and learn to live within the context of it's rhythms and cycles was very interesting.  <br /> <br />I watched the television show occasionally, and am surprised that this book is the first mention of Nellie Oleson, or the titular house, or some of the other storylines that were such staples on the show. I look forward to reading the other books and learning more about the elements that were not so prominently displayed.  <br /> <br />One warning that I have is to avoid reading the back cover of the book. In six short sentences, it manages to spoil the single biggest plot twist in the book, which doesn't come until 200 pages in. Just pick it up and start reading, and you'll be happier for it.  <br /> <br />Usually when I review children's books, I struggle with how to address elements that parents may not want to expose their children to. But in this case, happily, there's no conflict. Everything is not only G-rated, but blissfully so.  <br />	2005-02-08

As we read the letters, we learn about Leigh and his sometimes-difficult life living with his single mother and thinking about his mostly-absent truckdriver father. Leigh wants to be an author, and works at writing on the advice of Mr. Henshaw. While we never see Mr. Henshaw's letters, we get a good feel for what they contain, based on Leigh's responses. The writing is light enough to make the sometimes troubling details easy to deal with. This is a good book for any child who has expressed an interest in writing as a profession, and it is also a good introduction to more serious writing.	2005-02-08

Meant to be a supplementary text, it contains no problems or workbook functions. Rather, it moves briskly through the different approaches that can be taken to calculate the outcome of different decisions, with an intent to assist someone making decision-management decisions. <br /> <br />The opening is quaintly anachronistic, making the case for the use of researchers and computers in decision-making to a management world that was just beginning to wake up and smell the coffee.  <br /> <br />The book itself is as clear as it could possibly be for a rather dense subject; it is chock full of examples, and presents each approach succinctly.  <br />	2005-02-08

H. Watson, MD concerning his association with Sherlock Holmes. He rewrites Holmesian history by disavowing the death and reappearance of Holmes, and then strikes off in new territory by relating a previously unexpected extended adventure.          The book is surprisingly cheeky in some respects, revealing a previously hidden side of Holmes that is no less than pathetic. Holmes' addiction to cocaine reduces him not only to the level of his fellow man, but the the level of the worst criiminals and addicts that he has devoted his life to pursuing. This is a pretty bold move.         In other respects, the novel pays almost fanatical homage to the Holmesian tradition. Moriarty is reintroduced as lovingly as possible, and all of the regulars come out to play; despite the fact that most of the book takes place in Vienna, we get a satisfying glimpse of everyone from Mrs. Hudson to Mycroft Holmes.          In my opinion, the book falters when it attempts to introduce Sigmund Freud into the mix, setting Freud and Holmes up as equals who each have their own peculiarly specialized brand of genius. While I like that this idea cements Holmes' place in the real world (when I bought this and another Holmes book from a second hand store, a patron remarked with no joke intended that Holmes had been the greatest detective of all time), I don't like to see Holmes evenly matched by anyone, and there's a gimmicky \\"Dracula vs. Frankenstein\\" feel to it.          I would have preferred a more traditional Holmes story somehow extended to novel length; as it is, the traveling and the introduction of another major character left my thirst for nostalgia only somewhat quenched.    Despite these shortcomings, this is a very entertaining book, and fans of Sherlock Holmes will appreciate the chance to have another experience with their hero. Having read a couple of other post-Doyle Holmes books, I cansay that this is probably the best I have read for the fan interested in seeing Holmes as he was in the original stories.	2005-02-06

Hopelessly eccentric, devastatingly brilliant, and seemingly born of a supernatural ability to accomplish what he sets his mind to, the world's greatest detective has devoted himself to the pursuit of criminals. By matching wits with both the criminals he hunts and the official police inspectors, Holmes has found a pasttime that has a neverending series of puzzles on which he can train his amazing powers of observation and deduction. <br /> <br />We're all familiar with this character, and that's because, a hundred years after Holmes was first unveiled to the public, he continues to gather new readers. An icon who has spawned dozens of stereotypes, Holmes has a universal appeal that still fascinates us, even though the world of crimefighting has transformed itself entirely.  <br /> <br />For the modern reader, the writing is stiff and takes some getting used to. Watson's buffoonish amazement at every word Holmes utters is comical, and the pronouncements of the great detective seem arrogant and, at times, obvious or self-serving. But make no mistake. There's some magic in these writings.  <br /> <br />This particular edition (I have the 1975 printing) is a very nice introduction to Holmes, beginning as it does with the first two stories which made the character famous. Young readers in particular should enjoy the immersion in Victorian England, and the exposure to this great character's methods. Highly recommended. <br />	2005-02-06

At a time when fairy tales and folk tales numbered in the thousands, the Grimms wrote and published a collection of just a few dozen gems, many of which remain classics to this day.<br /><br />You are likely to have heard about many of these characters and stories. Sleeping Beauty, Little Red Riding Hood, two stories about Snow White, Cinderella, The Elves and the Shoemaker, Rumpelstiltskin, Rapunzel, Hansel and Gretel, the Frog Prince, and the Golden Goose are just some of the more famous ones. To read the stories as they were originally written is a pleasure; to see that they all came from the same two minds is amazing. It would be like the Farrelly brothers directing films that won the Academy Award for best picture for ten years in a row.<br /><br />  It's also very fun to see the differences between these original stories and some of the versions that are floating around in popular culture. If you're thinking of buying a collection of fairy tales for your children, getting the actual stories instead of a sanitized Disney version will expose them to an important body of literature, and can serve as a starting point for many important discussions about the decisions that each character makes.<br /><br />The book also has many wonderful stories that are less famous, but no less good. My favorites as a child included \\"The White Snake,\\" which is about a man who eats a white snake and is given the power to talk with the animals; \\"The Six Servants\\" and \\"How Six Traveled Through the World,\\" which each involve a set of servants with extraordinary powers; and \\"The Water of Life,\\" in which three sons set off to find a magical elixir that can save their father.<br /><br />There is no substitute for these magical and inventive tales, and this particular edition is extremely well done.  There is at least one illustration for nearly every story, including some nicely done color plates that stimulate the imagination without substituting for it. The emphasis is definitely on the words rather than the pictures.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for children and adults alike.	2005-02-06

Graves walks through each individual myth, noting alternative tellings, and follows each with a discussion on sources and interpretations. The stories themselves are pleasurable, but the emphasis is on an academic viewing of them. Each paragraph is marked with a letter of the alphabet for easy reference. In my copy, published by Penguin, I thought that the type was a little too small and dense, but the format and authenticity of Graves' work make this book definitive for anyone not studying the original texts themselves.	2005-02-05

We also get a dose of Bosch's daughter, his ex-wife, Kiz Rider, Buddy Lockridge, and McCaleb's widow. In the world of Michael Connelly characters, this is a family affair. <br /> <br />Given the integration of previously disparate storylines, you might expect this novel to fail, or to succeed only as a gimmick, in the same way that an Abbott and Costello meet the Three Stooges special is destined for mediocrity. <br /> <br />However, I'm happy to say, this book works as a novel, and is one of the most enjoyable in the series to date. To me, Connelly's biggest shortcomings are that he tends to include a plot twist too many and that his walk-through of investigatory procedurals can become so convoluted that the forward motion of the plot becomes mired in details. Neither of those shortcomings is evident here. <br /> <br />One of the remarkable things about the Bosch character is that, in every novel, we see another layer of his humanity. There are so many dimensions to what makes him tick that he really seems like a living, breathing person. And yet, he's a person unlike any that we've ever known; driven, relentlessly drawn to the act of chasing criminals like a shark pursuing prey. And like a shark, Bosch never stops moving; if he did, he might die.  <br /> <br />In this novel, Bosch's pursuit of justice is intermixed with visits to his daughter Maddie, and with his temptation to rejoin the LAPD. His investigations lead him to a mass grave and to a Nevada brothel, among other places. He finds himself in conflict with the FBI, which is more concerned with the FBI's image than with a speedy, relentless pursuit of the victim.  <br /> <br />About half of the novel is told in Bosch's words, and half in a third-person narrative focused on Rachel Walling. There are also occasional bits of story that center around the villain. Despite these bits, and some pondering by Bosch, we never really get a feel for the villain as a character; he's just the daily special on Bosch's plate. I didn't feel strongly about the divergent narrative one way or the other; I will say that Bosch's character voice isn't much different from Connelly's writing style.  <br /> <br />The writing is very well done, and the novel is well-paced. We get to see the agents engage in some interesting field work, and Bosch's attention to detail is fun to see. Yet, the story is more sparse than most of Connelly's work, with a more direct path from point A to point B. I think it works very well. Moreso than in any other Bosch book, I liked the ending. Endings are hard; Connelly got it right this time.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book, although I wouldn't choose it as my first Connelly novel. You should read a couple other books so that you can appreciate the secondary characters based on their histories in past novels.  <br />	2005-02-05

Books	4	7	8	N	N	Entertaining, educational, and well-written	A retelling of the classic Greek myths targeted at young adults.This book is very true to the original texts, with no effort made to spare the reader from the bloody details (and rightly so).  When I was a child, the stories in this book were every bit as exciting to me as more modern tales, and I now realize that there's an educational component to them as well. It begins with a description of each of the major gods and goddesses, and goes chronologically through some of the history of their reign over earth. Graves has handled the ending with an imaginative and strangely touching account of how the gods fell from power: <br />\\"As soon as the Emporor Julian of Constantinople, the last of the Roman emporers to worship the Olympians, had been killed fighting the Persians in A.D. 363, Zeus was told by the Three Fates that his reign had ended-he and his friends must leave Olympus. <br />     \\"Zeus angrily destroyed the palace with a thunderbolt, and they all went off to live among humble country people, hoping for better times. But christian missionaries chased them out with the sign of the Cross, and turned their temples into churches, which they divided among the leading saints. Mortals were now allowed to reckon by weeks again, as Prometheus the Titan had once taught them. The Olympians were forced to live in woods and caves, and have not been seen for centuries...\\".  <br />     If you're a parent choosing books for your child, you must include this book or something like it.  <br />	2005-02-05
361224:US	20422170	RXQPWKZY9C4RC	0345444884	122553244	The Talisman	Books	5	3	5	N	N	One of the best Stephen King novels; magical	This is among Stephen King's best books, which is a bit strange strange considering that he made the unusual decision to collaborate with an author who is less well known than himself, in a genre in which they both specialize.    But you can't argue with results, and The Talisman delivers in a big way. When 12 year old Jack finds himself on a sad, grey beach with his mother, a former movie star who is dying of cancer, it seems like his life can't get much worse. But he soon gets sucked into an adventure, in which he is sent on a quest to save his mother. Jack travels in two different worlds; the world that we live in, and another, fairy-tale world that mirrors our own in some ways. The fairy-tale world seems like something out of the Middle Ages, except that there are magical objects and creatures, some of which are very forbidding.     This is a masterful take on the somewhat common idea of a young person finding himself on an adventure in a magical land. By jerking Jack back and forth between the dangers of our world and the dangers of that other world, King and Straub bring both worlds into sharp focus. The dangers that Jack faces are very creative, including a sentence in a religious rehabilitation center for boys, and getting stuck in a dead-end job for a dangerous man.     This book is reminiscent of The Eyes of the Dragon, which is another King masterpiece, and yet it is slightly more slanted towards a realistic, and adult-oriented view. It also foreshadows the Gunslinger series in some respects, without being as abstract. At a hefty 768 pages, the sheer size of it might remind readers of King's name-making epics, such as The Stand. In short, this book has a lot of elements that have worked for King in the past (sad to say, I'm much less familiar with Straub's work, and so can't comment on comparisons to his other works, except to say that this is much better than Straub's \\"Ghost Story\\").     Even though some of the villains are somewhat cartoonish, Jack andhis relationship with Wolf, a friend that he meets along the way, is particularly well-done and touching. We grow to love these characters, and this emotional hook keeps us interested beyond just knowing who lives and who dies. We want them to be happy, and are concerned every time their happiness is threatened.    Despite the size, this is a perfect book for someone just easing into King's work. It has elements of horror (these guys can't pass up a chance to detail the sound of a bone being crushed, for example), but is mostly centered on fantasy themes. I also highly recommend this book specifically to teenagers, who are looking for a book that is exciting, but which is more adult than the children's books that they've read to date.	2005-02-04

It gives an alternate look at a couple of the movie's events that may not have translated onto the big screen particularly well. For example, the battle between the evil mogwai and Barney the dog is given in great detail. We are also privy to some of the thoughts of Gizmo and Spike (and Barney), which gives us some insight into where Gremlins have come from and how they got to where they are at the time that the book begins.  <br /> <br />I found the writing to be serviceable, with a couple of appreciated flourishes (such as the chapter which consists of only two words). The story itself is very imaginative and original, although you're probably already familiar with it. <br /> <br />Without being any more sophisticated, the book is a darker version of the movie, and director Joel Dante would have probably preferred to bring this version to the screen if he didn't have to worry about reaching a broad family audience. <br />	2005-02-04

Not enough. This is a splendid telling of the famous Greek myth, with simple language that in no way compromises the authenticity or the excitement of the tale. The illustrations are top notch, with a realistic approach making us really see what it would be like to be set on the back of a winged ram, for example. The story itself is about Jason and a group of heroes, the Argonauts, who go off in search of a valuable treasure, the Golden Fleece. Since this is the type of story that we see in the movie theaters all the time, it is a perfect introduction to a very important body of literature, that of Greek mythology. If you would like something that will entertain your child and also potentially turn him or her on to some worthwhile knowledge, pick up this book.	2005-02-04

Consider the following passage, which he ticks off after implying that a key component of the good ol' days was when a parent could put their kid \\"in traction\\" for publicly disobeying their parents:    \\"...Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote that `it takes a village' to raise children. My parents and their friends thought that it takes parents. They were sorry that some of my friends had maniacs for parents, but they didn't interfere. And they didn't want anyone poking their nose in our house, either.\\"     Aside from the fact that the quote \\"it takes a village to raise a child\\" is actually a venerable folk saying, and can't conceivably have originated with Clinton, the idea that it's incompatible with parents raising their own children is a complete misdirection. The book is full of this basic pattern: pull something that someone said, or a statistic or something like that, refute it with a one-liner that must have sounded funny in O'Reilly's head, and then move on to the next topic.    The complete lack of journalistic integrity might have been acceptable if the book were funny, or entertaining, or even light-hearted. But it's not any of those things. O'Reilly panders to the type of ignorant thinking that leads to a lot of anger and violence in this country, and he does it shamelessly.    Despite his insistence that he can't be correctly labeled politically, he is pretty much 90% conservative, and 10% wacky independent.     Also, the book gives repeated plugs for O'Reilly's television show, and offers his own self-congratulatory autobiographical stories. An autobiography is always suspect; after all, no one has more reason to lie about your life than you. O'Reilly proves that fact by trotting out a series of chestnuts that all portray him as a hero, even dating back to his courageous stance against a nun when he was six years old, takenbecause he couldn't stomach the lies that an illustration of happy children doing math exercises represented.    I know that because of its political nature, the reviewers on here are just giving voice to their own political agendas. As someone who is always looking for thoughtful books that bear out the ideas of people on both sides of the aisle, I can tell you that this book is trash. The only way this country will be improved upon is by getting beyond the junior high thinking level that this book propagates.	2005-02-03

Pierce has problems, both at home and on the job, and the pressure of the profession is grating on him like sandpaper.  Yet that same pressure keeps him moving, and propels him from place to place without having to face up to the problems he sees. <br /> <br />The writing in this book is colorful and uber-realistic, bringing us into very close contact with the mostly-miserable patients who wind up in Frank's ambulance. The character descriptions are very strong, and the ear for language is even stronger. While some of the cases relate to each other in ways that might not seem entirely believable, the plot is messy and random enough that we can swallow it without sacrificing our sense that this events are actually happening in our world.  <br /> <br />I have a hard time recommending this book, because it really affected me emotionally. This is a tribute to the mastery of language of the author. The bleak outlook on life is so compelling that you have to be ready to be depressed by the story.  Comfort food it ain't, but it is a very absorbing tale, and a fairly quick read to boot. If you think that you might like to shadow an overwhelmed EMS in a dark urban setting in real life for a day, pick it up. But if you think that that experience would be more harmful than educational, leave it alone.  <br />	2005-02-03

After having grown up in Beacon, it was both gratifying and a little bittersweet to realize how much I didn't know about my own hometown. For anyone who is familiar with the picturesque Hudson Valley, this book will present a captivating story on how a small American city is born and begins to grow.	2005-02-03

To think that one man, Arthur Schlessinger, has published so much on one of the most important and controversial men in American (and, by extension, world) history, is just mind-numbing. In an age where collaborations have become the norm, the peculiarities of having a single person synthesize all of the information are especially valuable.  <br />This isn't a quick read, or even a lively one. It's an amazing amassment of information, and therefore is an invaluable reference to anyone studying this president, or this time period in American history.  <br />	2005-02-02

Boy befriends stranded alien. Alien phones home. End of story. The plot is familiar, but the movie captured the imaginations of millions because of the flourishes that Spielberg brought to it as a director. The children in the movie seemed so very real compared to the children in so many other movies. And the tear-jerking moments, especially when a body bag is zipped up over ET's ash-grey face, are emotionally gripping.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that Kotzwinkle is two and a half steps above the type of hack that usually writes this kind of adaptation. He successfully captures the flavor of the movie, and adds a whole other dimension to the story by mining the strengths of a book format. Unhindered by special effects limitations or the need for dialogue, Kotzwinkle brings us into the minds of the characters, most notably E.T. himself. He adds scenes that would have been too slow for the movie, and fleshes out existing scenes that could only be spared a moment of screen time.<br /><br />If all movie adaptations were done like this, the genre would have a better name. As it is, Kotzwinkle has done it right, and it's no surprise to me that he has a successful writing career outside of this adaptation. If you're a fan of the movie and the characters, this book is definitely a way to extend and deepen your pleasure.	2005-02-02

The culture shock was immediate and hasn't ended yet.  <br />This book bills itself as the first detailed history of this region in the twentieth century. It includes selections from about 20 different writers, all of them with academic credentials in the subject. The pictures are sparsely placed, and in black and white, and there are no charts or anything. I suppose that it's not meant to be forced down the throats of reluctant learners; rather, this is the only book of its kind and those who use it don't need to be coddled. The writing as a whole seems typically scholarly; in a world in which specialization is the word on everyone's lips, it's nice to see a logical grouping of such a vast region that hasn't yet gotten it's due. If you have an interest in this fascinating region, this is absolutely required reading.	2005-02-02

Lovecraft, William Faulkner, Truman Capote, and a host of more modern authors, including Joyce Carol Oates and the Michael Jordan of horror writing, Stephen King (King also writes an introduction). This book is special because it pays homage to one of the pulpiest of pulp genres, horror, and combines it with a span of authors who have a significant literary pedigree. By presenting stories that are cerebral as well as scary, and by giving classic authors such as Poe their due, the book might be slightly less accessible to someone who has grown up equating horror writing with, say, early works by Dean Koontz. But anyone who goes into this collection with an open mind is sure to be blown away by the horror- the sheer horror- of it all.	2005-02-01

During the narrative, the authors note when there are significant alternate versions of a story, and also point out some of the connections between the stories and modern culture. For example, the idea of a rosy baby confronting an old man with a scythe on New Years day is descended from the image of Zeus confronting Cronos, his father. The book doesn't dwell on the gory details, but neither does it avoid the violence, murder, and rape that permeates these ancient myths.  <br /> <br />This book basically seeks to spark interest in the Greek myths among children, and when I was a child, it succeeded in spades. An undergraduate english professor once told me that the Bible and the Greek Myths are the two most important source documents for all the important works of English literature. This book will start a young person on a path to understanding one of these two sets of myths. <br />	2005-02-01

For each description, any hints and advice that Annemann cares to share are woven into the text. The tricks range from somewhat dull to very good, and involve various levels of preparation (including none at all).    Personally, I thought that this book wasn't very good. The writing is confusing in some parts, and consistently dull. In the edition I have, the typeface changes inexplicably at a couple of different points in the book. It seems as if they literally photocopied the pages from two earlier books and threw them together in this volume without bothering to match the type.     As a repository of tricks, it's serviceable, but I see no reason why the consumer wouldn't get a little more bang for his buck by purchasing a reference book that includes some discussion, and which has been put together with a little more care.	2005-01-31

When I picked it back up at 12 years of age, I liked it so much I read about sixty other books in the series.<br /><br />  This series lacks a lot of things when measured up against its competitors. It has no magic, very little humor (and even less funny humor), and the characters all sound like they walked out of Pleasantville. The Hardys are so square they make the Scooby Doo gang look like P. Diddy's posse. The world of the Hardy boys is free from dysfunction; they're never even tempted to do anything immoral, and a vast gulf separates them from any modern child who might try reading them.<br /><br />  Despite all this, the series has a certain charm to it. The gee whizzes and oh gollies are funny without meaning to be, and the earnestness with which the Hardys set out to solve mysteries is refreshing in its simplicity. Each mystery is presented in such a way that the reader can have fun trying to second-guess the characters, and the methods that they use to solve the case should appeal to the logic-minded reader.<br /><br />This book is fairly short and easy to read. I suggest that you give it a shot, because if it appeals to you, you'll have hundreds of hours of enjoyment ahead of you.	2005-01-30

As always, Herriot presents us with a lifestyle that we can all envy, despite his self-deprecating asides.  He paints a graphic, lovely, and seemingly true-to-life portrait of life in the Scottish Dales.  <br /> <br />Herriot is at his best when describing visits to local farms when he does hands-on work under the watchful eyes of the farmers. Their stoicism is always amusing, and the technical details of the veterinary practice of the time are always fascinating. I found the RAF adventures to be a little less engaging, but the book is well worth reading. <br /> <br />Highlights of this book include a depressed man whose dog, Digger, starts to go blind; a sick farmer whose calf has severe stomach problems; and the care of a horribly wounded stray cat that turns out to be rather remarkable. <br /> <br />I didn't read these books in order, and now I wish I had. You can really enjoy all of the stories without any background, but you can probably enjoy Herriot's life a little more if you see him go from newly appointed apprentice to respected top doctor.  <br />	2005-01-30

Sherman has promised to give the details of his aborted attempt to fly around the world in a balloon. But even the most excited members of the club couldn't have anticipated a story as exciting as this.<br /><br />Most of this book takes place on the island of Krakatoa, where a secret utopian society has been formed by twenty carefully chosen families of four. The details of life on this island are what sets the book apart; everything is done in a very particular, highly structured way that is presented as ideal.<br /><br />A highly imaginative story, this book will keep any reader's attention, and it will raise issues for the reader that are interesting to discuss. Is this a good utopian society? What are the good and bad points of this type of life? And what type of society would you form, if given the chance?<br /><br />When you're choosing a book to read, one good indicator of quality is how well a book has stood the test of time. This book has been selling strong for nearly sixty years. That's no fluke.<br /><br />I should also note that the illustrations, done by the author, are extremely well-done, and really help to bring the story to life.	2005-01-30

At Table 3, Nigel Richards plays THIONINE, a violet dye...Three turns later, Nigel lays down USE, forming UG, SH, and ETHIONINES, which is an amino acid...On the next turn, [his opponent] Adam makes another extension by playing BAM to the triple word score, forming BUG, ASH, and METHIONINE, another amino acid...\\" <br /> <br />Author Stefan Fatsis gets a writing assignment that turns into a full-blown obsession, as he finds himself drawn inexorably into the quirky world of competitive Scrabble. Fatsis explores Scrabble from many perspectives, ranging from the history of the game to the physical changes that take place inside a Scrabble expert's brain.  <br /> <br />But the bulk of the book is devoted to spotlighting the personalities that Fatsis comes into contact with, and to his own efforts at achieving an expert rating. The book basically follows this quest, breaking repeatedly to discuss some other aspect of the game.  <br /> <br />Along the way, Fatsis explores some interesting social issues. Why is the sport dominated by women at the lower rankings, but ruled by men at the coveted expert level? Why do so many of the top achievers seem to be walking basket cases? What obligation (if any) does Hasbro, which owns the North American rights to Scrabble, have to foster the legitimacy of the sport? <br /> <br />The excerpt above is one of dozens of play by play descriptions of the board that demonstrate the vast gulf between expert players and the types of players who bust out the game during family gatherings. Most Scrabble experts don't even know the meaning of most of the words that they use; their vocabulary is bolstered by memorizing list after list of the 120,000 words found in the Scrabble dictionary. They calculate the odds of drawing certain letters from the bag, and they might bluff by intentionally laying down a phony in the hopes that their opponent won't have the gall to challenge it.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book very much, especially after I got through a somewhat slow beginning. It fails to rise to the level of the best nonfiction books on similar topics, but it does present a compelling look at a little-imagined subculture from a variety of interesting angles.  <br /> <br />I do have some criticisms of the book. My biggest problem is that Fatsis placed himself in an uncomfortable situation in which he had to walk the line between objective journalist, competitor, and good friend to the players of the game. At times, these roles conflict unavoidably. Instead of working his way up into a position of acceptance by the expert level players, Fatsis has used his journalistic credentials to \\"buy\\" his way into the tightly knit group, and his association with the top players is a key component in the progress he achieves as a competitor. Also, I see a difference in how he writes about himself and his fellow players. When talking about others in the game, he is brutally honest in analyzing their lives and their games. When talking about himself, he is only brutally honest about himself as it relates to the game. We get to know everything about Stefan the Scrabbler, and very little about Stefan the person. The fact that he respects his own privacy more than the privacy of his peers is a little troubling.  <br /> <br />On a similar note, Fatsis uses the platform of his book to break one of his own cardinal rules, complaining about the luck of the draw. He never fails to point out when his opponents draw more desirable tiles, but he rarely mentions it when he \\"gets lucky\\" in this same way.  <br /> <br />Also, I thought that perhaps too much time was spent giving back stories on some of the luminaries of the game; it felt to me as if perhaps he felt an obligation to write a little more than was necessary about the people he'd befriended.  <br /> <br />Despite these small complaints, I thought that the book flowed fairly well. Fatsis's flair for language comes through in some ofthe writing, and the description of crucial tournament decisions by the best in the world are filled with tension and excitement. Also, we come to care for many of the offbeat personalities who have hung their life's ambitions on Scrabble. Matt Graham, Marlon Hill, and \\"GI Joel\\" Sherman are more than just characters; I found myself concerned for their well-being, and cheering for them as they struggled to find a place in this world.  <br /> <br />You don't have to be a word-hound to enjoy this book; it is a keen and insightful look into a highly competitive sport, and that's going to be interesting to just about anyone. <br />	2005-01-29

He'd rather eat candy than anything else in the world, and he's rather eat chocolate than any other kind of candy. Still, it comes as a great shock to him when, the morning after a mysterious encounter with a candy man, his toothpaste tastes like chocolate. In fact, everything tastes like chocolate, and he finds that whatever he puts into his mouth is transformed into pure chocolate.     This instantly causes problems, and John tries to remedy the situation even as the power to transform things into chocolate intensifies.     Some of the descriptions, particularly food descriptions, in this book are very evocative, and the story is fairly straightforward. The author also does a good job of thinking up different ways for John's gift to become a problem.     But I'm not sure that the story has aged particularly well-the device of the magic coin that transforms John, and the reversal upon repentance might seem a little cliched, even to a child. Surely, most children would recognize that a doctor who declares that John's insides are chocolatified is not a qualified medical practitioner (this would be okay if the story was goofy and humorously surreal, but Catling plays it straight).     Despite these complaints, this is an entertaining little story that really does capture the imagination in places, and children who love to read will find this a pleasant way to pass a little time.	2005-01-28

But he quickly learns that \\"his\\" Indian is a living, breathing being who has been taken from the life that he used to live. Omri and his friend are torn between a desire to toy with the magical forces they've been given, and a sense of responsibility to those whom their awesome powers affect.  <br /> <br />This book is remarkable in that it doesn't write down to children; the language and sentence structures are both very sophisticated compared to other books written for the same age group. It also blends perfectly the ordinary character of Omri, and the magical forces that he encounters.  <br /> <br />Unlike many children in these kinds of stories, Omri does just what any of us might do, and the plot challenges him in imaginative, yet realistic, ways.  <br /> <br />Children will become addicted to these characters, and rush out to read the other books in the series. And adults should appreciate the lessons that the book teaches: most importantly, about respecting those over whom you have power (not that there's even a hint of preachiness). Also, an adult who is bored with reading children's books at bedtime might find this story as compelling as their child will.  <br /> <br />As far as the charges of racism go, I can see how the portrayal of Little Bear's broken english and tendency toward violence might be seen as offensive. But I think the stereotypes are extended to the Texan cowboy (so that it's not as if Indians are being specifically targeted), and more importantly, the book goes to great lengths to teach Omri and the readers to respect Little Bear as a person. Omri feels awe as he learns about another culture, and learns that, despite their vast differences, he and Little Bear are alike in many ways, and can learn to love each other. So, I think that this book does more good than harm for race relations among its readers.  <br />	2005-01-28

Tom's naturally independent nature, his demand to know the reason that things work as they do, and his self-righteousness combine with his smarts to get him into trouble at the academy. Every time he uses his brain to distinguish himself from his peers, he is slapped back down by the strict staff.  <br /> <br />This book distinguishes itself from its predecessors by having a more cohesive storyline than the others. While many of the books involve stand-alone episodes in which Tom employs one scheme or another, this book has far more continuity, as Tom finds himself in an ongoing struggle with the academy administration, led by the harsh Father Rodriguez.  <br /> <br />Partially because of this, the chapters deviate from the familiar formula of Tom extracting money from those around him. Instead, he has to use his wits to accomplish other feats, such as unlocking a locked door, for example, when he lacks the key.  <br /> <br />This difference is generally a positive one, as we get more and more invested in the story as it develops. We are also treated to the inside of the religious academy, and we really get a sense of its inner workings and how students lived there.  <br /> <br />As always, the language is engaging, filled with colloquialisms that are easily understood, even though they are far outdated. The books allow us to see a slice of American history while still being completely accessible to modern children.  <br /> <br />Kids will love to place themselves in Tom's shoes, and imagine how they too can put one over on their peers and loved ones.  <br />	2005-01-28

Dr. Dolittle is a somewhat absentminded amateur naturalist who has, by dint of a lifelong academic pursuit, discovered how to speak the language of the animals. Or some of them, anyhow; all of the books are suffused with the good Doctor's attempts to add another species or several to his list of languages.     This particular book is, like others in the series, deliciously uneven, as it presents a series of canine anecdotes before it bothers settling into the main plot. Every night dogs from all around come to hear each other speak, and to tell their life stories, each of which is an amusing short story in its own right.    Then the book moves on to the subject at hand, which involves Dolittle's attempts to learn the language of insects. Frankly, some of the other animals don't believe that anything as small and dumb as an insect could even have a language, but Dolittle soon proves them wrong. And just in time, too, because at some point, an enormous moth (the size of a small house) lands in the garden, and Dolittle feels sure that it is trying to communicate some great need.     Some of the language in the book is somewhat antiquated, but the story is so strong that it rises above that problem. The books succeed for several reasons, the most important of which is probably the immensely entertaining idea that people can learn to talk to animals, and that animals have their own societies that are very similar to human societies. The key to this concept is that Dr. Dolittle has learned how to speak with animals; there is no magic amulet or technological wizardry that has given him this power. Indeed, all of the wonders of the book are seen with a naturalists eye, and readers are sure to be inculcated with an appreciation of the value of the scientific process.     Hugh Lofting has tapped into an inexhaustible reservoir of stories by making us seethe world around us in a slightly different light; he hasn't created a world of his own so much as told the stories of our world in a new way.     Every child should read this series, and this book in particular is a very exciting volume, setting the stage for the next volume.	2005-01-27

The entire Maine town believes that she killed her husband during an eclipse, years ago. And now she's accused of killing her longtime employer, a bitch of a woman who ran her ragged as long as she lived. This book is Claiborne's first-person narrative, as she gives the mother of all statements to the interrogating police officer. <br /> <br />This book marks many milestones for King, and is very different from everything he'd written before (although a harbinger of things to come). The extended first-person narrative is similar to From a Buick 8, and the strong female protagonist is also a first. But more than those obvious firsts, this novel is amazingly complex, with not one, but two complete storylines supported by the narrative. The two deaths occurred in different times and for different reasons, but the context of Dolores's life gives them an interface that is sometimes subtle, and always compelling. This is the book that first displays the level of storytelling that lifts King up above his horror genre roots.  <br /> <br />King has never been afraid to ask his readers to bear with him as he tries something new, and I would think that hardcore fans would enjoy this book for the spot-on voice, the compelling story, and the typical Kingsian flair for language and description. But this book is not for King fans alone. Indeed, the relative lack of blood and guts might make this more appealing for a reader of serious literate fiction, and less appealing for the horror book junkie.  <br /> <br />My first thought after reading this book was that King was making a concerted effort to be a feminist, or at least to give the idea of a strong female protagonist it's due. Rose Madder, Gerald's Game, and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon are all later stabs at the same theme, and I think that of the four, this is undoubtedly the best effort (not to take anything away from the other three).  <br /> <br />One final note: this book is heavily couched in the heavy-handed colloquialisms of Dolores, and if you're going to be turned off by the constant colorful phrases (think Mark Twain), then this might not be the book for you. But if you can accept the language as Dolores speaks to us, get ready to enjoy a story that will make you really care for this strong, proud woman of Maine.  <br />	2005-01-27

But one day, all that chocolate-eating catches up with him, as tiny dots (which smell of chocolate) appear all over his body. The book follows Henry's day-long adventure as he must contend with probing doctors, schoolyard bullies, and highway robbers as he seeks to come to grips with his strange malady. <br /> <br />This was a favorite of mine as a child, mostly because all of the individual scenes were exciting and fun to read. Henry himself doesn't have much character, but the people that he meets are colorful and memorable.  <br /> <br />Written before America's obesity problems became headline news, the book portrays Henry as surprisingly thin. Nevertheless, there are a few good lessons to be learned, including racial harmony and eating in moderation.  <br /> <br />Children will enjoy putting themselves in Henry's shoes as he tries to get out of what seems like an impossible situation.	2005-01-27

We not only get to read the Grade A masterpieces that King is known for, but we also get to see some of his quirky ideas, done for fun. Stories that stand out to me include: <br /> <br />\\"The Mist,\\" which is a terrific creepy story in which a mist hiding all sorts of weird Lovecraftian monsters rolls into town, forcing a group of strangers to band together in a grocery store for mutual protection. I love stories where a group of unaffiliated people are brought together to hold off a seemingly insurmountable threat, and King gives the idea royal treatment here (better than in, say the Langoliers). <br /> <br />\\"The Raft,\\" which was adapted for a Creepshow short, is about a group of teens who find themselves stranded on a raft in a lake after a death-dealing film of pond scum surrounds them. The characters are very realistic, and King scores major points by taking a familiar situation and turning it into a chilling nightmare. <br /> <br />\\"The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands\\" is an odd little story that has the gentlemanly tone of a classic horror story from Poe's age, featuring a man who refuses to shake hands because he fears the consequences of those who come into contact with him. <br /> <br />\\"Survivor Type\\" is another great story filled with awesomely creepy imagery (it's stuck with me for over a decade now); it's about a doctor who finds himself stranded on a desert island with little hope of rescue or prolonged survival. <br /> <br />\\"Nona\\" is a long story that is probably one of the weaker pieces, using the familiar device of an alluring dangerous not-quite-human female, who seeks to seduce the hero as part of a larger scheme. <br /> <br />\\"The Monkey\\" is, simply put, pretty bad. Maybe it was fresh when it was first conceived (or maybe it wasn't), but the idea of a cursed children's toy is so played out that the self-referential Chucky movies now seem stale. King doesn't bring enough to this plot to make it interesting. <br /> <br />King also sneaks in a couple of horror-themed poems in \\"For Owen\\" and \\"Paranoid: A Chant.\\" To me, they weren't very interesting, and I doubt that a serious student of poetry would give them much acclaim either (but then again, what do I know?). <br /> <br />Again, it's difficult to rate an array of stories as a group, but I would have to say that the three best pieces mentioned above are worth the price of the book on their own.	2005-01-26

Coffey is a giant of a man, but simple-minded, and has been convicted of raping and killing two young girls. There are lots of story lines, ranging from a severe urinary tract infection to a magical mouse, but the main show involves Coffey's supposed guilt, and a special power that he seems to possess. I won't spoil any more of the plot.<br /><br />I read this book as the chapter books were originally published, and I really found that that publishing format hindered my enjoyment of the book. Not only was each of the six installments subjected to a summing up of the circumstances of the narrator, but the brevity of the individual segments just didn't let me immerse myself in the story. By the time each segment came out, I had forgotten, or at least become emotionally detached from, the characters.<br /><br />This complete novel is, in my opinion, much better than reading the installments, but it still has some faults compared to King's best work. All of King's novels have a type of character who is a straight shooter, and a moral person, and brave, and ready to mix it up if honor so dictates. This character type is presented too abundantly in this work for my taste, and I just felt like a lot of the devices were over-the-top in asking for our involvement. For a setting and group of characters that presents so many opportunities for moral shading, I just felt like there was too much black and white.<br /><br />That said, this novel has a lot going for it. There are several interlocking stories and subplots, and they all gel together very nicely. I also found the ending, which takes place in the frame story at the nursing home, to be unusually satisfying. And the narrator, Paul Edgecomb, really is a very likable fellow, and seeing him at two different stages of his life really makes the reader think about aging, and the elderly.<br /><br />So many of King's novels deal with a battle between spiritual forces of good and evil, but this book almost seems to be more about magic, and the change is refreshing. There are fewer explanations for the phenomena that we see, but that preserves an air of mystery and wonder about them happening.  Sometimes explanations are nice, but I think that in this case, King makes a wise decision by leaving some things open for interpretation.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this book over the works of almost any other author in the horror genre, but if you're going to read everything in the King canon, you can leave this one until about halfway through.	2005-01-26

Cursed by a surviving Gypsy to grow ever-thinner, the 246 pound Halleck begins dropping weight in a major way. As he seeks to remove the curse that's been placed upon him, Halleck enlists the help of a mafioso to escalate his battle with the gypsy tribe.  <br /> <br />This is one of the books that marks Stephen King as a master of horror, even if it doesn't really contribute much to his legacy as a literary talent. The writing brings us a level of immediacy, and the language is so realistic that it draws you right in. The characters are believable, even if the mafia violence gets a little over the top.  <br /> <br />The book is interesting because it leads us to sympathize with Halleck throughout his troubles, even though, when you think about it, getting off scot-free for murder isn't one of the traits that we admire in our fellow human beings. Halleck's repentance isn't even all that sincere, given that it comes after the gypsy has a leg up on him, and the one thing that he doesn't do, even when desperate, is turn himself in to the authorities for the murder. Nevertheless, we want Halleck to get his curse removed, if only because the specter of him shedding weight relentlessly is so disturbing. It's like The Biggest Loser on steroids.  <br /> <br />In this early work, King does what he does best, and that's tell an engrossing tale that keeps us enthralled. Much more straightforward than his epics or even his shorter later works, the lack of sophistication is replaced by a kind of keenness that cuts right to the bone of the story.  <br /> <br />If you've never read a book by King, you could do a lot worse than to start with Thinner. It may not be his best work, but in many ways it exemplifies what makes him so popular with his audience. <br />	2005-01-25

But despite all his efforts to get a good night's rest, he start waking up earlier and earlier. Eventually, he links this phenomenon with a strange ability to see a whole new world around us that none of us can see. The aura surrounding someone signifies how long they have to live. And then he starts to see things more substantial than auras, actual beings that exist on some plane that is critical to our world.     I love that this book strikes off in new directions for King. His first senior citizen hero is a novelty, and he makes even a whippersnapper like me put some serious thought into what it will be like to reach an advanced age (if I'm so lucky). Contemplating the inevitable troubles that accompany aging is actually perhaps the scariest thing in the book; at the least, it's refreshing.     I also enjoy seeing Derry from another pair of eyes. In It, King described how children operated in a world of their own that was basically hidden from the world of adults; this description was so true that it stuck with me. I was delighted to see another world and society operating, equally unseen, in the town of Derry. It is a take on the senior citizen community that was really engaging and enjoyable.    The chills are chilling (and I like that there's an homage paid to ancient Greek Mythology), the scares are scary, and the gore is gory. But no one reading a King book would expect any less.     The real test of a King novel is how the pacing and the plot and the character development work, and I'm pleased to say that in this book, they all work quite nicely. There are a couple of confrontations that come off as a little cheesy to me, but for the most part, the book is a great read.	2005-01-25

She and others in the town start to slowly undergo a transformation into alien lifeforms. As she loses her humanity, the world at large starts to notice that all is not right in Haven, but once the alarm is raised, there is serious question as to whether the alien threat can be contained.  <br /> <br />     To me, this is the worst Stephen King book in the world. I've read pretty much everything he's published, and no other book turned me off like this one. I read it as a teenager, and I had just discovered how magical King's books could be. I was struggling to find something to bridge the gap between young adult books and grownup books, and King was pretty much the only author that I was excited about at that stage in my life. So imagine the bitter disappointment I felt when Tommyknockers went from bad to worse.  <br /> <br />     The writing is no different from most of King's work from the same period, but the story itself was just so monumentally depressing that it brings no joy into the reader's lives. It just kind of sucks the life out of you while you read, by giving you more and more to be disappointed in.  <br /> <br />     Imagine a book in which you are presented with ten or so characters with whom you can feel some amount of emotional attachment. And then imagine every single one of those characters slowly succumbing to some horrible medical condition, like cancer, and then dying. This book was kind of like that, except it has none of the literary aspirations or sweetness that might make such a slog worthwhile.  <br /> <br />     Or consider the case of \\"Monster Dugan,\\" an enormously strong and able law enforcer who rides to the rescue towards the latter part of the book. After pages of buildup in which his strength and determination are put on display, he just kind of fizzles out, succumbing to the aliens and conditions in much the same way as everyone else.  <br /> <br />     King has identified \\"Dreamcatchers\\" as a somewhat depressing book written during a difficult period of his life. I can't help but see some connections between that book and this one, and both end up with the same type of unavoidable, predictable conclusion.  <br /> <br />     In short, I would only recommend this book to a die-hard King fan. At 747 pages, it's not going to endear itself to the casual reader.  <br />	2005-01-23

Morgenstern investigates a mystery that has bothered him ever since he learned of it. Why are the gondoliers of Venice, once world-famous for their beautiful singing voices, now silent? As he reveals the facts of the case, we are treated to a fable that is as engaging, in its way, as The Princess Bride.         The bulk of the story deals with Luigi, an aspiring gondolier who wants nothing more than to join his peers in song in the Grand Canal. When his dreams are crushed, he becomes a quiet background figure in Venice, known only for his ability to wash dishes and his goony smile. But behind that sad, goony smile, Luigi never stops dreaming of accomplishing his lifelong goals.         I don't want to spoil any of the plot points of the book, so instead I will praise the skill of the writing, which is equal to the skill on display in Princess Bride. The device of the garrulous researcher is consistently hilarious, as are all of the asides and digressions that shine light on the impossible, yet almost-real world of Venice. The story lacks the depth and complexity of the Princess Bride, and so falls far short of that book in terms of overall impact. Rather, it's as if this is an extension of the former work, and could almost have been worked into The Princess Bride as a longish chapter (the entire book clocks in at a meager 110 pages).          Readers will fall in love with Luigi's stoic smile and deference to the world around him. He is a humble man, but one who has an inner spark that can never be extinguished, and the power of his character, along with the humorous writing, drives the book.          This is a must read.	2005-01-23

Unfortunately, he doesn't have any of the traits that Vikings look for in a leader. Before he can inherit leadership of the tribe, he must first pass an initiation (along with 19 other Viking boys) in which he captures a young dragon and trains it to hunt fish for him, as dragons have done for generations.  <br /> <br />This book has all of the trademarks of a traditional contemporary teen novel; the social outcast, the single unpopular friend, the strong bullies, and the out-of-touch, demanding father are all familiar figures to us. But in How to Train your Dragon, these conflicts are set against a goofy, over-the-top surreal Viking background, in which the foremost authority on dragon-training has published his advice in a book (which reads, in its entirety: \\"Yell at it!\\"). The humor is broad and plentiful, and the book is broken up by graphic insets that range from amusing childish drawings of the characters to reproductions of pages from ancient tomes on dragons.  <br /> <br />Even though I thought that the book didn't work on some levels, I enjoyed the originality. The action scenes involving dragons are interesting, and readers will enjoy many of the jokes. The appearance of an enormous sea dragon provides for some truly chilling moments, and the more serious interactions between the sea dragon and Hiccup are probably the best in the book. <br /> <br />Another strength of the book is the ability to evoke the flavor of a fairy tale, by presenting us with initiation rituals and dragons in a way that sometimes seems magical.  <br /> <br />The success of this series will depend on whether the writing can be tightened up in future volumes. The backdrop is consistent and interesting, but the scenes seem somewhat disjointed at times, and not enough is done to generate warmth for the hero. Also, the flame-defeating device near the end is too contrived. These weaknesses are what set the book apart from, say, the Harry Potter books.  <br /> <br />Overall, I recommend that you give this book a try; it's a quick read, and you might find yourself eagerly awaiting future installments. <br />	2005-01-23

Reed and Glass, Inc. made Henry and his sometimes-obnoxious friend Midge Glass some money last year, and after a survey of the neighborhood, Henry discovers that there is a need for baby-sitters in the area. The bulk of the book focuses on the adventures that Henry faces as he tries to run a business with as many problems as rewards. <br /> <br />     Even though this might seem like a somewhat dull premise, the character of Henry Reed is so indomitable that he maintains our interest throughout. Children will be impressed with his ability to apply his skills to seemingly insurmountable obstacles, and also with the way that Henry manages to earn respect from the adults that he meets. His intelligence and Midge's creativity lead to amusing solutions for outwitting the children that are determined to be disruptive.  <br /> <br />     The book is presented as Henry's journal, which allows us to experience the events through Henry's eyes. This works fabulously.  <br /> <br />     The Henry Reed series was captivating to me as a child in the early eighties, and remained a favorite of mine for many years. Anyone who gives it a chance will fall in love with it.  <br />	2005-01-22

Chiri is a half wild husky dog, and Link is the lonely trapper who befriends him. We follow the husky as he grows from a young pup, orphaned after a vicious attack by a black wolf.  <br /> <br />     The descriptions of the landscape and wildlife betray an intimate knowledge of the northern woods, and the life of the trapper Link bears the same whiff of authenticity. The natural settings help a young person to develop an appreciation for nature, and for where humans belong in the scheme of things. There are also lessons about trust and honor, and other values that are desirable.  <br /> <br />     The action scenes are plentiful and exciting, and the heroes of all species use their strength and cunning to overcome all obstacles.  <br /> <br />     The book is in the tradition of White Fang, but is written in a more straightforward manner that should be pleasing to younger readers as well as adults who appreciate the crisp style of a Louis Lamour tale.  <br /> <br />     If you're already a fan of Kjelgaard's writing, you should consider this to be one of his best works.	2005-01-22
378633:US	20422170	R19S4M2V2MQ3FO	076790818X	997649583	A Short History of Nearly Everything	Books	5	3	5	N	N	For anyone who ever wanted to know anything	Popular author Bill Bryson tackles a topic that's quite a departure from his previous books on backpacking trips and the English language: science. Or perhaps it's not such a departure after all, as Bryson displays his trademark genius for ferreting out the most colorful of details associated with the great scientific discoveries in history.  <br /> <br />     Bryson sums up the significant achievements of science, from physics and the Big Bang to human prehistory, with a lot of chemistry and meteorology and biology and genetics and geology in between. When he sees a good story, such as that of Sir Isaac Newton probing his eye with a needle to see what happens, he recognizes it and presents it to the reader. But he also seems driven to provide a comprehensive base of science. No matter what discipline he tackles, he explains everything that we know, and then notes what we don't know, which tends to be a shocking amount whether he's talking about molecules or people.  <br /> <br />     A lifelong devotee to truth, Bryson also sets the historical record straight, sometimes deflating the achievements of men who we've come to know as household names. Hubble the astronomer turns out to have been something of a liar; double-helix describing Crick and Watson are only partially deserving of their fame (and somewhat sexist to boot). He also shines the spotlight on scientists who have, for one reason or another, been ignored by history, as in the case of Rosalind Franklin, who deserves to share Crick and Watson's spotlight.  <br /> <br />     In the end, the reader is left with a stock of interesting stories and a working knowledge of how the world works.       <br /> <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />     Bryson gets everything right in this book; his prose tends to be both hilarious and succinct; entertaining and informative; completely accessible without leaving out any of the important bits.  <br /> <br />     I also appreciated that there are some necessary environmentallessons to be learned; no objective science-minded observer can walk away from this book without some misgivings about the impact humans have had on the earth.  <br /> <br />     The book does tend to get slightly less interesting towards the end, but this is more a product of the increasing complexity of the subject matter rather than representing a misstep on the author's part. <br /> <br />    A high school or undergraduate science teacher in any discipline should include appropriate sections of Bryson's book as part of the reading material. Indeed; a school could do far worse than throwing out all other textbooks and relying on Bryson alone to guide students to a point of understanding how science works.  <br /> <br />     But even if you're just looking for an entertaining read, this book is for you.	2005-01-21

But she's also a 10 year old girl, and she is beset by the usual problems of fitting in with the other kids, and relating to her mother. But her life takes a turn for the worse when a mysterious man starts asking questions about her. She is eventually forced to strike out into the world in an attempt to learn more about herself, and to help herself deal with the special pressures she must face.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />This is a great book, not least of all because the premise is incredible. Every ten year old dreams of having superpowers, and this book inserts that exciting proposition into a realistic background that is more typical of young adult reading. As a child, I read this book again and again, and even remember having dreams in my adult life that are related to the imagery in the book. The writing is clean and engaging, and allows us to fully enjoy the fascinating story as it unfolds.  <br />	2005-01-21

One of my good friends in college once told me that the purpose of undergraduate studies in any discipline is to get the student to learn how to think. By this measure, Vorhaus gives us a very good undergraduate education in poker. While he doesn't ignore the specific nuts and bolts strategy that we would expect, of much greater value are the lessons that he gives us throughout. They could be summed up briefly as \\"keep your head in the game\\", and \\"always think about what the other guy is thinking about;\\" of course, they run much deeper than that. To call this a workbook may be overstating the case; however, Vorhaus frequently invites us to take a break and generate our own ideas on the topic that he is currently instructing us on, with the goal of teaching us critical thinking skills that will translate into dollars at the poker table.        By the end of the book, we've been exposed to some amusing anecdotes, some common situations in poker, and a look into the minds of some of the opponents that we will face, with lots of admonitions against becoming one of the less desirable stereotypes of poker players.   The Good and the Bad:       The writing in this book is very strong; while it may not win any awards for literature, it is miles ahead of the pack of poker books in terms of reader accessibility. Despite a frequent return to a couple of major themes (Don't tilt! Don't tilt! Don't tilt!), the book manages to move through most topics with a fair amount of clarity and entertainment. Vorhaus is not afraid to present himself as the horse's ass in his anecdotes, as long as it is in the service of showing us how to play. The approach of teaching critical thinking skills is also very much appreciated.        On the down side, I wish that Vorhaus had spent a little more time on presenting situations that the player is likely to find him or herself in, and I would have liked a mention of how an online poker player might apply some of the lessons that he is teaching differently.       Another criticism has to do with the exercises. If Vorhaus expects us to do the exercises in the various sections, he should have put a little more into them (rather than just saying \\"when do you go on tilt\\"?). Also, the \\"diaries\\" of some of the players we're likely to meet (a clever approach to getting us inside the head of our opponents) are a little long; the space could have been better spent by giving us more practical advice on how to beat the player-types presented, or by giving us more player-types.	2005-01-15

The essays are generally wonky and academic; however, the sheer number of learned viewpoints gives enough value to the discussion to make some slogging worthwhile.     I can't help but look at the 23 female authors and think that there is an imbalance of some sort here. I wonder if there are no critical examinations of female speech as it might be damaging or undercutting to men simply because no such papers exist, or whether there is a political agenda that exists as a smudge on the objectivity of the collection. But even if that is true (and I'd give 5-3 odds that it is), the ideas that the book give voice to are of great value, and are overpowered by a society that is hopelessly biased in the other direction.      I'm still waiting for the book or other platform which will allow these ideas to permeate to Jane Average working in small town America; right now, they don't seem to be able to trickle down beneath the level of articulate women at university cocktail parties.	2005-01-13

But McManus then steamrolls his way deeper and deeper into the tournament, squaring off against talent-laden opponents including his sometimes-mentor but current adversary TJ Cloutier. Along the way, McManus covers the murder trial of Sandy Murphy and Rick Tabish, who were accused of murdering Ted Binion.  <br />     McManus delves into history to create backstory for the trial, his own poker skills, and the game of poker itself, and integrates all of the knowledge, along with scores of literary references, into a personal narrative that can be riveting, and which also provides useful information for an aspiring poker player.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />     Early on in this book, I thought that the nonstop literary references and the creation of a dichotomy between \\"Good Jim\\" (the author at his best) and \\"Bad Jim\\" (the author at all other times) were distracting, somewhat highfalutin', and often forced. He makes references to Hunter Thompson (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) and A. Alvarez (The Biggest Game in Town), both of whom created intelligent and respected books out of their Las Vegas pilgrimages. It seemed as if McManus was trying, none too subtly, to insert himself into a respected pantheon of authors, and I have to admit that I resented him for it. <br />     But as McManus's adventure in Las Vegas develops, I grew to enjoy his authorial voice more, and eventually found the thrills of his poker experiences to more than make up for any shortcomings I found in the text. The Good Jim/Bad Jim device at first seemed like a way to evade responsibility for making bad choices (Hey, don't blame me! I'm Good Jim!). In retrospect, however, that device also allows him to disown and reject his negative impulses without giving up any of his pride or values. He knows that Bad Jim is bad, and can therefore reject those influences more readily. <br />     McManus also brings us a refreshing dose of honesty, both at the poker table and in his personal life. He describes the thoughts behind his poker decisions as they come, and manages to take credit where due without being overbearing, while at the same time disclose those moments when he had totally misread his opponents. I contrast this book favorably with a poker advice book by professional Phil Helmuth, who never tells an anecdote in which he makes the wrong decision. <br />     By giving a comprehensive account of the murder trials, and delving into the history of poker as it evolved, McManus waters down the most exciting aspects of his book, but this is a small criticism; it's not as if those topics are boring in the slightest. It's just that they lack the raw power of the author facing off against icons of the game. <br />     The only digression that I found to be inappropriate, and even puzzling, was when McManus devotes a few pages to the biological reasons behind the impulses that men feel to cheat on their wives. Interesting? Yes. But it came off as slightly defensive for the author who rarely lets a woman go by without mentioning her level of physical attractiveness, and who openly courts marital disaster by hobnobbing intimately with strippers and attractive opportunists. We'll call his chapter noting the progress of women to the top of the game a penance for these transgressions.  <br />     But as a reader and a poker player, I don't really care about how bad Bad Jim can be. I demand to be entertained and instructed, and this book accomplished both, in spades. I feel like it improved my game, and also gave me things outside of the game of poker to think about. Was McManus trying to insert himself into a pantheon of highly respected books about the game? Probably. But the important thing is that he belongs there.  <br />	2005-01-12

This book covers everything from the soft-sell approach to legal recourses, and everything in between, along with advice on which approach might be best in any given situation.

One of the most beautiful girls in school takes note of him when he is assigned to operate the fog machine in the school play, but he is so smitten with her that his usual social awkwardness devolves into a tongue-tied panic.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />I liked the character of Jacob, and I certainly remember a student or two in school who he reminds me of. The book does a good job of fleshing out that anonymous character, and giving us reasons that contribute to that type of personality. The writing is also engaging and fun, with funny descriptive metaphors that are sure to capture the imagination of many children. But I rate the book fairly low because it is presented as a realistic story, but many of the scenes are so unrealistic as to seem surreal, or at least borrowed from a low-budget made-for-tv comedy about the horrors of high school (thought the characters seemed more junior-highish to me). For example, when Jacob accidentally stumbles into a school bully, the bully promptly stuffs him into a locker without so much as a word. There are no pop culture references, no shades of nuance in most of the characters, and a series of stereotypes about the jocks who seem to make up the majority of Jacob's classmates. Also straining belief was Jacob's over-the-top clumsiness, which often left him sprawling around like a clown in front of a crowd of peers. Nevertheless, the book is a quick and enjoyable read, and may give students a moment of reflection about their near-invisible classmates. The socially awkward student himself, however, is not likelyto gain much in the way of constructive advice, as the solution to Jacob's problems lie in the persistence of a beautiful girl who is willing to put aside all of the social hierarchy because she wants to date Jacob.  <br />	2005-01-02

Actually, I suppose it does.  <br />As a small business owner, I received this book as a present and could just never force myself to sit through more than a couple dozen pages at a time. This may say something about me as a business owner (now a failed business owner, come to think of it), but I think it also says something about the book itself.  <br />I find that it is useful as a reference book; that is, it will point you in the right direction to solve a specific problem that you might have. Personally, I had a hard time thinking of it as a place to turn to for help, although the information in it would have certainly proved helpful in several instances. Skimming through certain chapters can also get your wheels turning in a productive manner. But since it markets itself to all small businesses, a very large percentage of the information contained therein is just not going to be helpful to any particular business, either because it doesn't apply to that industry, or because of the size of the small business (small business, of course, includes a vast range of business sizes from lemonade stands to million dollar enterprises).  So, a cover-to-cover reading is not likely to be an efficient way to use this book.	2004-12-31

Migration and hibernation are famous examples, and Heinrich investigates these phenomena in enough detail so that the reader can appreciate how amazing they really are. He also explores a host of other methods of survival, never allowing us to lose sight of a couple of key concepts that mark the difference between life and death for the untold billions of winter residents. The first is the idea that all behavior and physiology has evolved over the ages since animals first managed to coexist with the strange and frightening conditions that mark the advent of winter. The second is that each individual creature must maintain a positive energy surplus over the cold winter months; all winter survival strategies are predicated on the idea that a creature must stoke its inner fire with energy of some sort.  <br />     Along the way, Heinrich interweaves his own experiments and experiences, leaving us with vivid pictures of his encounter with a fatally wounded snapping turtle, and watching a beaver lodge as the sun rises, for example.  <br />     The signature winter animal that Heinrich returns to time and again is the kinglet, the world's smallest perching bird that somehow manages to eke out a living despite the fact that it weighs no more than two pennies. The kinglet is a fitting choice for the tireless Heinrich, because he unearths a variety of survival strategies that the kinglet employs, yet still leaves an air of mystery around this amazing bird, whose presence in the cold winter woods is still not fully explained.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />     Heinrich's writing remains impeccable. His own enthusiasm for his subjects leaps from every page.  In contrast to so many nature writers, Heinrich is someone who derives a spiritual boost every time he walks into the woods, yet doesn't attribute this to any actual spirits. Heinrich is a man of science, first and foremost, and his childlike wonder at each stirring creature destroys the stereotype of scientists who study nature without truly understanding it.  <br />     The concepts are explained  in simple terms that we can all understand, and I found the mix of science and entertainment to be spot on. The chemical reactions that a bear undergoes while hibernating is educational and interesting; the story of a man who crashes through the ice onto a hibernating polar bear is entertaining.  <br />     I have nothing bad to say about this book. Heinrich is at the top of his game, and shows no sign of slowing down.  <br />	2004-12-30

At least half of the book contains the trappings of a novel, tracking the lives of individual ants and colonies as they exemplify points in his discourse. He also, less successfully, maintains this device when discussing ant god Edward Wilson, who is legendary among myrmecologists everywhere. Readers are invited to identify with the leafcutter scout who eventually sacrifices her life in service of her queen, or the two enormous bullet ants who slowly wind up their tales after their colony is destroyed. The book explores the mating cycle of the ants, the relationships between individuals within the colonies, the relationships between different colonies of the same or different species, and the way that ants deal with adverse environmental conditions. He also touches on the relationship of ants to the larger ecosystem that surrounds it, and gives the reader the theoretical knowledge necessary to see an ant colony as a superorganism.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />I really enjoyed this book. The scientific discussion was easy for me to follow as a layman, and the narratives were very engaging and even exciting in parts. Even though I've read one or two other books on ants, this is the first time that I've walked away feeling as though I have a good handle on what ants are, and what they mean to the world. What's more, I put the book down caring about ants, and wanting to observe them in their natural habitat. I think it's safe to say that I will never walk past an ant on the sidewalk without devoting a moment's thought to what that ant is up to. Hoyt also gives a good cross section of species that exemplify all of the oddities that are the mark of a highly diverse and evolved group of insects, and I liked that he explored some of the non-obvious issues that come up when studying ants. For example, he talks a bit about how ant speciesare named, and how researchers collect the ants they study.  <br />     I also appreciated the drawings that were included throughout the text, and the quotations that kick off each chapter. Little touches like this make the journey more fun.  <br />     On the downside, Hoyt makes the mistake of devoting a lot of space to discuss Wilson and myrmecological colleague William Brown. I enjoyed the facts, but I just felt that Hoyt was too close to these subjects to portray them objectively. Two scientific giants who are very active in their field can't be treated objectively by a science writer who has a personal relationship with them, in my opinion. As a result, we as readers are subjected to a lot of compliments and almost no criticisms of Wilson and Brown, and we also have to hear about their side of the story in scientific controversies. It's not that I didn't find the topics interesting; I just question whether I was reading a colored version of the truth.  <br />What I learned: <br />So much that it can't be capsulized, but I will note a couple of interesting ant facts that stuck with me. Ants enter into a series of complex interdependent relationships with the animals and plants around them. Birds and other predators might track a marching column of army ants in order to benefit from the flood of escaping prey. Beetles disguise themselves as ants in order to gain access to their homes. Aphids are kept as cows, and protected in exchange. Mites attach themselves to the feet of ants, giving the ants extra climbing power. Trees attract ants with food and shelter, in exchange for which the ant colony will keep more damaging foragers away. Leafcutter ants collect bits of leaves by the thousands, but they don't eat them. Instead, they use them as mulch to grow a certain kind of fungus, which they do eat. When a queen leaves a colony to found her own new colony, she places a bit of fungus beneath her tongue and uses it to start a new garden. If she forgets to do this,or the new fungus doesn't grow, she will die. Amazon ants can't do anything for themselves, but they can raid other colonies, stealing the pupae to raise as slave workers. Without the slaves, the Amazons couldn't even feed themselves.  <br />	2004-12-22

He introduces us to the people he meets and his companions, notes the spectacular wildlife and visages that he encounters, discusses some of the ecological issues facing Yellowstone, and gives us a look into the nuts and bolts of making decisions when hiking through the wild.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />I enjoyed some of this book, but generally I found more to complain about than to praise. This book, while lacking in major faults, just seemed to have no spark of its own that would make reading it a requirement. I felt as if I'd heard each environmental discussion before, read similar descriptions of the park in other books, and was frankly skeptically annoyed at Ferguson's claims that encountering a moose bore spiritual meaning, one proof of which was the mystical departure of a cold after seeing a moose.  <br />    Ferguson displays an impressive knowledge of the species that he encounters, and I appreciated his willingness to note the wildlife, and to share interesting tidbits of information about everything from wildflowers to otters. For me, these areas were where the book was most successful. <br />     But the overall tone gave me the impression that Ferguson perceives a world in which nature can only be truly understood by those in a special club who are willing to pay homage to the spirit of the land. Ferguson's desire to read meaning into ordinary encounters just rubbed me the wrong way, I suppose, and even now I'm struggling to put my finger on exactly what bothered me so much.  <br />	2004-12-22

(Dortmunder Novels)	Books	2	2	5	N	N	Not a good first Dortmunder to read	Professional criminal Dortmunder, who is characterized by his sad-sack appearance and his inoffensive demeanor, is suddenly a man on a mission after his ring is stolen by Fairbanks, a rich homeowner. Dortmunder was breaking into Fairbank's estate, and got caught. When the police arrive, Fairbanks can't resist an impulse to tell the police that the ring belongs to him, and Dortmunder is driven to try to recover his ring. He chases Faribanks from one domicile to another, always netting plenty of cash, but never attaining his goal. The climax involves clashing armies of crooks and security guards in Las Vegas.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />I enjoyed the early portions of this book, in which the situations and the characters are both fresh and interesting. But as the book wears on, believability is stretched further and further, and an explosion of new characters leaves only enough time for a stereotypical understanding of each (as with the hulking thief named Tiny--- yawn!). The problem with continually escalating the stakes and the forces at play on either side is that eventually you're just repeating yourself, but louder. Westlake falls into this trap, and the climax is only mildly suspenseful. I would have liked to have seen Dortmunder himself in a wider variety of situations, so that we could more fully explore and appreciate his quirkiness, but sadly, that was not the direction that Westlake chose.  <br />     I picked up this book because I enjoy the Parker novels so much, but I don't think I'd give Dortmunder another try. To me, Stark is the real author and Westlake is the pseudonym. <br />	2004-12-22

A different character might spend the bulk of a novel in jail, but ultimate pragmatist Parker doesn't tarry in planning and executing a daring escape. Author Stark throws a series of breakout situations at Parker, as he struggles for the room to operate within the confines of an ever-shrinking police search. As always, there is a seedy citizenry to take advantage of, and a division between thieves with honor and those without.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />This is only my third Parker novel, but I thought it was the best one of those I've read. There's something innately exciting about a prison break, and Stark treats it with a master's touch. The writing is lean and evocative, as always, and the relentless action keeps the pages turning. Stark has a way of throwing interesting problems at the characters, and then having them solve those problems in ingenious and yet believable ways. The combination of the fantastic elements of Parker's glamorous life and the realistic manner in which he moves through the world is one of the things that makes this series so enjoyable. The body count in this book was very low as compared to the other Parker novels I've read, which points to the variety of skills that he must employ to think his way out of trouble.  <br />On the down side, Parker puts his faith in others far too often in this book. At least three times in the book, he relies entirely on the ability of others to navigate trouble, and in two of the instances, he's relying on non-criminals with whom he's had very little contact. This seems unlike the paranoid Parker, and I suppose I just didn't like seeing him so vulnerable.  <br />	2004-11-28

463374:US	20422170	R1JYE6DNPIYFFN	1880418622	871670140	The Dark Tower (The Dark Tower, Book 7)	Books	5	6	15	N	N	A satisfying conclusion	The final chapter in King's Dark Tower series, this book is a labor of love, and it shows.  King picks up where he left off, and the gunslinger's ka-tet is finally broken as some of the characters breath their heart-breaking last breaths. We learn fairly early that at least one of the central characters is going to die; until the unthinkable happens, I was in complete suspense as to who would live and who would die. In between the dying, and the crying, and the walking, and the shooting, and the killing and the thrilling, and the freezing and the sleeping, we come to know Roland and his friends better than we ever have before. There are epic battles and brilliantly interesting villains, and Roland has a lot to do. He and the others must save the Beams by assaulting the camp of the breakers who threaten to bring it down. They must also save the life of that bumbling writer, Stephen King, who has managed to put off completing his tale for far too long. Meanwhile, Mordred stalks them at every turn, and the obstacles they face range from monstrous to monstrously mundane.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />If King wants to close out his career with this book, he will have gone out at the very top of his game. The closing chapters are like Jordan's perfect shot just before his second retirement. King might maintain his level of expertise, but he is unlikely to improve on it. There's not a page that doesn't demand to be turned; at two in the morning, I put the book down to go to bed. But at 4:30, I was still reading.  <br />     I liked this book because King doesn't get wrapped up in creating overly epic hammy scenes. He saves the emotion and heavenly music for when it matters; in the meantime, Mordred can still get a bad case of the runs. In too many epic stories, the emotional amplifier is turned to 11 for the entire run. King knows how to create peaks and valleys over which our hearts can wander. When he cranks it up to 11, we can tell, because we aren't numbed to thevolume.  <br />     Other online reviewers express dissatisfaction with the way in which some of the conflicts are resolved, but I really think that this is part of the package. If you're a gunslinger, and you're facing one of your great enemies, there aren't that many possible outcomes. Either you're going to hit, or you're going to miss. And gunslingers never miss.  <br />     I did enjoy some of the highly creative bad guys who emerge to make the journey a little more arduous. In particular, one glamming adversary feels like something from Alice in Wonderland, but I won't spoil it farther. Suffice it to say, the encounter will make you laugh, and will make you cry.  <br />     Another nice thing about this book is that it leaves enough of the story untold that we can take pleasure, as readers, in the fact that there is, in fact, more to see. The end of the journey has come, but that doesn't mean that we can't retrace our steps and meander a bit. The final battle of Jericho, the wandering days of Pere Callahan, the adventures of John Cullum, and the fate of the breakers are just a few of the loose ends that we can twirl about in our imaginations. Mayhaps one day Sai King will grace us with another tale; if not, and he comes to the clearing at the end of his path, another wordslinger may take up the tale, as has been the case with many literary greats. A collection of short tales, \\"Stories of the Tower\\" would do us very well, say thankya. <br />     A note should also be added about the format, which is terrific. King continues his trend of breaking the story down into books, chapters, and sub-chapters, which really helps to keep things moving. And the three different types of artwork ( <br />     King's epic begs comparison to the other great epics, to the Lord of the Rings, to the Chronicles of Narnia, to the Drangonlance seasons and even to non-literary epics, such as the great Westerns and the Star Wars films. In my opinion, it fares very well in comparison tothese other books. It lacks the simplistic purity of Narnia, which was created for children. It doesn't have the academic weight of the Lord of the Rings books, which were more concerned with geography than story-telling. Unlike classics that have had time to age, the Tower series is an epic tale shoehorned into the trappings of a modern novel. It was written in our time, and is steeped in the culture of the last forty years or so; but this in no way lessens the merit of the series, or prevents it from becoming an instant classic.  <br />     I have a few criticisms, below, but please don't let them come between you and this series.  <br />     I will agree that, in this closing chapter, the insertion of himself into the series can at times be distracting. I understand and enjoy the concept of King as storyteller in his own story, and I am glad that he is there. But I think that the inclusion of a villain who looks like Stephen King (times 3, no less) for no apparently good reason is overkill (the villain could have chosen another shape). That scene in particular intruded on our ability to enjoy the chapter, if only because it's too easy to imagine King pleasing himself with his self-caricature. Similarly, when Roland is calling off names of people he has known who have been a part of his quest for the Tower, he includes King, who he doesn't really like, but not, for example, John Cullum or Aaron Deapneau, or any of a host of other characters who would seem to fit the criteria that Roland is using before King.  <br />     Another minor criticism is that there were a handful of wrong word errors. I found no more than in many books, but I have higher standards for a masterpiece. Notably, in one scene, the gunslingers create a foul-smelling fire by burning bones, and they make sure to sit \\"downwind\\" of it. Of course, the intent was that they would make sure to sit upwind of it, not downwind.  <br />     In a strange departure from his rapid-fire storytelling, a sectionabout making clothes from hide is unnecessarily drawn out. I'm not sure why this is.  <br />     I also agree with another reviewer who criticized the afterword, which is focused on many things that are not important to us, the reader (you write for US, goddammit, and don't you forget it, monkey!). I would have preferred King talking about ending the series, instead of talking about readers who might seek him out. He says that he finds some of his earlier afterwords in the series a bit embarrassing, but I loved them, and feel that they burnish the glow of the dark tower.  <br />	2004-11-08

But time organization is one of the many, many things that the ever-practical Parker is good at, and he neatly balances ferreting out the source of a contract on his life with pulling a heist at an isolated, but immensely well-guarded, estate near that Canadian border. Once again, Parker has to work with other thieves in order to accomplish both goals, and his interactions with the underworld are fascinating as always.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />This is only my second Parker novel (and my second Stark novel), but I'm already beginning to appreciate the elements and rhythm that make up the series. Even though Parker's actions would be detestable in the real world, the fact that he is fiction allows us to take joy in watching a tough-guy who means what he says, says what he means, and has the guns and the wits to enforce his rigid moral code on those around him. Stark has captured an underworld that lacks the relentless glamour and gravitas of The Godfather (or any of a million-and-one crime movies out there), and yet avoids the complicated realism of The Sopranos. Stark's criminals are like those in the movie The Usual Suspects, or maybe a Tarantino film. Crime is a profession, an exciting profession with real drama, and the man who excels in it is the ultimate professional. He's like the Sherlock Holmes of shooting people and stealing stuff; he is so highly specialized that he can be an apex criminal, but probably doesn't know a blog from a boo-bah.  <br />     If I had a criticism of Firebreak, it would be that, at times, the characters are a little too talkative, and their conversations can be a little too neat. I can accept Parker as an exceptional man who imposes order and logic on a messy world, but when other characters pick up that black-and-white clarity, it seems insincere. <br />	2004-11-08

Each story carries the Dahl trademark of wickedness, often involving a protagonist who has an exciting improbable idea, and who then works to make it a reality.  <br />\\"Skin\\" is about a man who sees the work of a famous artist on display in a gallery. Seeing the work, he realizes that he knew the artist before the artist became famous, and that he convinced the artist to tattoo a masterpiece on his back. When the gallery owner sees the tattoo, he tries to figure out a way to own it.  <br />\\"Lamb to the Slaughter\\" is about an old woman who kills her husband with a leg of lamb, and then serves it to the investigating police officers while they speculate on the location of the murder weapon. <br />\\"The Sound Machine\\" is about an engineer who builds a machine that can allow him to hear the pain that plants feel when they are cut or otherwise damaged.  <br />\\"An African Story,\\" which is told using a frame device involving a RAF member, is about an old African man who discovers that a young man living alongside him is violently insane. When he discovers that a black mamba is stealing milk from his cow every night, he hatches a plot  <br />\\"Galloping Foxley\\" is about a sheltered man, the epitome of the staid British gentleman, has his commuting routine disrupted by the introduction of a stranger onto his train car. He soon remembers that the stranger is a prefect, who used to torture him mercilessly as a boy.  <br />\\"The Wish\\" is about an imaginative boy who fantasizes that a successful trek across a rug, while avoiding dangers represented by the different colors, will result in getting a puppy.  <br />\\"The Surgeon\\" follows the story of a doctor who is rewarded by a very rich patient with a diamond worth about a million dollars. After hiding the diamond by freezing it into an ice cube, the house is burgled. Features a rare unalloyed happy ending.  <br />\\"Dip in the Pool\\" is about a man who gets the idea to cheat in a daily pool held aboard an ocean cruiser. The pool involves auctioning off a range of numbers which represent the predicted number of miles that the ship will travel in a day. When the weather turns his \\"low field\\" sure thing into an almost certain loss of his life savings, he decides to jump off the ship in order to slow the ships progress as he is rescued.  <br />\\"The Champion of the World\\" seems to be the genesis for the famous children's book \\"Danny, Champion of the World,\\" and it involves a pair of men who decide to poach a wealthy landowner's pheasants by slipping them sleeping pills.  <br />\\"Beware of the Dog\\" is about an RAF member who lands, badly injured and unconscious, he knows not where. When he wakes up, he begins to suspect that he is not actually in England, but rather in the clutches of the enemy.  <br />\\"My Lady Love, My Dove\\" is about an obnoxious wife and a slightly less obnoxious husband who agrees against his better judgment to wiretap the bedroom of some visiting bridge partners.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />Without a doubt, the best tale is \\"An African Story,\\" which has the ability to evoke all sorts of emotions in the reader. The moral shadings of the course of action that the man decides upon are interesting; the odd elements of the story, especially the strange, almost-believable actions of the Mamba snake, are fascinating. The triple-coming of the snake, and other elements, give the story some common elements with classic fairy tales. The younger character, Judson, who is driven to murder by the sounds of other creatures masticating, is creepy as hell. And, finally, the brief frame story involving the RAF member is simultaneously interesting on its own, and useful in giving the inner story a sense of plausibility. In fact, as I write the praises, I think that this may be one of the best short stories Dahl has ever done (although the competition for that title would befierce indeed).  <br />   Two of the stories, Champion of the World and Galloping Foxley, are basically rehashes of material made more famous in later incarnations, and so they were much less interesting to me.  <br />     Many of the stories were not up to the standards that I have come to expect from Dahl; I suppose the publishers had a slim stack of excellent writing that hasn't already been used in more famous collections.  <br />   The Surgeon was interesting, but felt like only half of a story. With the fate of the diamond put in jeopardy by a random burgling that happened to involve an accidental ingestion of the diamond, credibility was strained. Some of the character reactions just didn't seem very well done either.  <br />   Others, such as \\"The Wish\\" \\"Beware of the Dog,\\" and \\"My Lady Love, My Dove,\\" were so weak that they seemed almost unfinished. Clearly, they are from early in Dahl's career. A more polished Dahl would have had a better payoff to a proposed wiretap, in my opinion. I also questioned ending the book with the wiretap story; unless the world disagrees with my low rating of it, I think it should have been buried somewhere in the middle.  <br />     \\"Dip in the Pool\\" was very good, although a little rushed, and I similarly enjoyed \\"Skin,\\" the opening.  <br />     Overall, I have to say that that book fell a little below my expectations, but was still a joy to read. I only wish that Dahl had written more; his body of work is substantial, but still leaves me wanting.   <br />What I learned: The betting pool on the cruise ship's daily mileage must have been based on reality. Also, apparently inviting a couple to play bridge in postwar England and then to spend the night was not an unusual situation.  <br />	2004-11-03

Without any real hope of rescue, he marshals his inner resources to scratch out a means to survive in the wild. He uses his sole tool, a hatchet given to him by his mother, to great effect. After barely surviving a tornado, Brian discovers that the storm realigned the sunken plane, enabling him to retrieve an emergency pack. After three months by the lake, he is able to turn an emergency transmitter on, and is rescued almost immediately. A short epilogue explains the changes that the ordeal wrought in Brian's character, and explains also that an impending divorce between his parents has occurred notwithstanding his adventure.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />I liked this book a lot. The writing was clean and realistic, and Brian, existing in a cultural vacuum, seems to be a realistic, three dimensional character. I was reminded several times of the movie Castaway, as Brian and the titular character of the film share many of the same needs, obstacles, and triumphs. Despite the intrusion of the divorce subplot, the story is basically a stripped-down survivalist story and I like the simplicity. Compared to My Side of the Mountain, the story is almost painfully real; however, it may not be real enough to be considered 100% realistic. Brian's interactions with the wildlife are scary enough to keep our attention without being an epic battle ending with a slain wolf, or anything like that. There are also several \\"life lessons\\" woven skillfully into the text, such as the failure of self-pity to solve problems, and the meaningful interactions possible with nature.  <br />I guess my main criticism would be that the ending seems abrupt, although I suppose the rescue is done that way on purpose. <br />	2004-11-03
468038:US	20422170	R2QC9XYEUD6413	0395857007	810027955	The Lost Grizzlies: A Search for Survivors in the Wilderness of Colorado	Books	2	2	6	N	N	Needed less pomposity	Author Rick Bass recounts three years of annual efforts to find evidence of grizzly bears in Colorado's San Juan mountains. Each time, he heads into the woods with a colorful cast of characters, most notably Grizzly Years author Doug Peacock. Their goal is to document the presence of the endangered grizzly; success will presumably spark a reaction in the government and conservation agencies to take efforts to protect both the grizzly and its environment. Bass finds what appears to be plenty of evidence, culminating in a terrifying encounter with a large male grizzly from 30 feet away. The centerpiece of the book is on the way that Bass and his companions interact with the environment around them, be it the woods, or the towns and ranches that they visit for one reason or another.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />As much as I liked isolated sections of this book, the drawbacks left me colder than a group of activists on a mountain peak at dusk. The good things included a worship-inspired look at Peacock, who is shown to be a modern day Johnny Appleseed in that he is far more comfortable in the wilds than among the people. Peacock charges off into the brush cursing when agitated; and he is liable to charge into the brush cursing when he is happy and excited, too. At a meeting with a fundraiser, he turns down money because he has been asked to have contact with a donor in exchange for the funds. He is motivated by unexplained feelings, mysteries of the woods, and mystic natural signs whose meanings he comes up with unaided. The fact that Bass seems to worship Peacock only becomes annoying when Bass attempts to insert himself into the relationship by intimating that he understands Peacock better than others in the group (I'm not even saying he doesn't, just that it detracts from the narrative). In most cases, the hero-worship merely serves to enhance the story, as we get behind a mythologizing of a man that even critics would call strongly individualistic.  <br />   We also fail to get a good idea of how the larger movement to document and thereby save the grizzlies is progressing. We don't know exactly what proof will produce what effect, and so the real-life impact of the mission is de-emphasized to the extreme. <br />   I have three other main complaints; the first is that the large majority of the conservation ethic articulated by the characters is extremely basic. There's a lot of quoting of Leopold, and a repeated return to the idea that we are all a part of the forest, that every unit is dependent on related parts, etc. He not only presents these ideas with the pride of their creator, but he goes over them again and again, with minor variation. Better was when he talks about specific issues, such as the ethical considerations of radio-collaring a bear (although we never get the pro side of that statement). Another interesting set of information is given by a character named Tolisanti, who gives a discussion on how many creatures are needed to preserve a species, and what roles different species play in terms of conserving an environment.  <br />   The second main complaint is Bass's annoying tendency to read spiritual overtones into almost everything. The quality of light, the sighting of a bear skull, the accidental discovery of a hunter's camp; everything has a meaning. And Bass doesn't think that he's coming up with the meaning, he clearly reads that the forces of nature are communicating with him, directly and on purpose. A meadow is happy that he's leaving, although it didn't mind his presence while he was there, for example. And there is a constant return to the idea that the existence of grizzlies is a function of the spirit of those who seek them rather than their own mechanizations. This might be ok for another reader, but I want more hard facts and far less spiritual rhapsody about how Rick Bass is a receptacle that nature chooses to fill with portent.  <br />   Finally, I have a big problem with Bass's attitudethat his own conservation ethic, which has a heavy basis in a Native American-like basis of respect for each creature, is the only proper one. He repeatedly refers to academics and bureaucrats in wildlife management in a demeaning manner, drawing a deep division between himself and paper-pushers. While I personally share many qualities and sympathize entirely with many aspects of the hippie movement, my sympathies fall short of condoning some of the bizarre attitudes. The way to save the woods might include a frontiersman-like effort to catalogue what's out there, but it also includes involvement by the government, as well as a lot of the hard scientific work conducted in the laboratory. Just because everyone's not a Davey Crockett doesn't mean that everyone doesn't care about preserving wildlife.   <br />What I learned: <br />The Hundred Years rule of thumb asks what population size is needed to give itself a 99% chance of survival for 100 years. There is a new idea in conservation that preserving wildness might be better sized by establishing a series of concentrated rings, with more human activity allowed in the outer rings, but little to no activity allowed in the central rings. This allows for less chafing on both sides of the fence, for both civilization and the wild. Different types of species as far as conservation goes include keystone species, which anchor a set of inter-special relationships; indicator species, which give early warning when something bad is happening to an environment; flagship species, which are the sexy animals that might motivate the public to devote energies to conserving an ecosystem; and recovery species, which indicate that an ecosystem that has been damaged might be coming back to life.  <br />Also, and most interestingly, when hunters shoot bears who have just recently emerged from hibernation, they may find live ants scurrying around in their stomachs, which have not yet begun to produce stomach acid.  <br />	2004-11-03
468096:US	20422170	R1IU3HTQCORF5T	0553379267	284019128	A Canticle for Leibowitz (Bantam Spectra Book)	Books	3	7	10	N	N	As a good read, this classic loses steam	The three sections of the book project into the post-nuclear world of the 27th century, the 32nd century, and the 37th century. Each section follows the activities of a religious order of monks who were the sole recipient of knowledge during a centuries-long dark age. As the centuries pass, a civilization slowly emerges, and is ready to make use of the documents from our age which hint tantalizingly at the secrets of \\"electrical essence\\" and the rest of the scientific discoveries that man made in the days leading up to the nuclear era. The first book is undoubtedly the best of the three, having the advantages of unveiling the futuristic world that Miller has dreamed up, and also the best character in Francis, an aspiring monk with a heart of gold that may have been the magnet for a miracle. By the end of the third book, a new nuclear war is threatening to break out, and the monks are considering taking to the stars to keep the flame of humanity burning bright. The book draws on religious themes, with lots of theological and moral arguments being made by the various characters.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />I loved the first half of the book or so, and couldn't get enough of learning about the post-apocalyptic world and the characters who populated it. The story had a very faint quality of artificiality, especially when it came to politics, but generally, the strengths of the plot and characters overcame this. The character of Francis was very engaging for his sweetness and almost gump-like simplicity, and his murder at the hands of cannibalistic mutants was a shock that required rereading. The longer the book goes, however, the more the characters began to feel like vessels for theological and moral arguments, and the final few chapters are so steeped in religion that it was difficult for me to finish. The fascinating story, involving a basic conflict between an abbot and a doctor on the morality of encouraging radiation victims to commit suicide, takes a backseat to dreams and symbols that are less compelling. Overall, the book has those ingredients that make a classic; an inspired background, intriguing human interactions, and philosophical statements all coexist on the same pages. The warnings against nuclear war must have seemed especially relevant when the book was first published in 1959. <br />What I learned: <br />This book gave me an appreciation for the intricate inner workings of the Catholic Church. I grew to appreciate the seriousness of sanctity, as it is built on an unbroken chain of tradition that has been passed on for thousands of years.	2004-11-03

They came to know Marsh as Mahmoud, an Arabian fighter, in a previous book, and his brother Alistair (known to them previously as Ali), has asked them to help Marsh cut his ties to the estate so that the two of them can live their lives contentedly in the Middle East. The problem is that, as rightful heir to the Dukedom, Marsh can't leave unless he is sure that there is an able successor. Without his vigilant watch, the estate will fall into the hands of a scheming couple, the Darlings, who act as Regents to the estate. Before long, it appears that someone in the line to the throne is attempting to clear the line of successors so that he can take the seat of power, but it isn't clear until the end which of the various suspects is responsible. In the end, the villain is revealed, and his ambitions are thwarted after Holmes and Russell unearth a five year old boy who is rightful heir.     The Good and the Bad:  On the one hand, I have a ton of criticisms of this book, all of which I feel are very valid and which spoiled the book almost entirely for me. On the other hand, I find myself open to the possibility of reading another novel about Holmes and his wife, so King must be doing something right.     One problem with the book is the writing, which is steeped in the overly-proper verbosity that characterized the Arthur Conan Doyle series. This is not so bad when there is action provided to keep us interested, but the book breaks down entirely for long stretches in which nothing exciting happens. For example, a ten page description of Russell's first tour of Justice Hall was particularly excruciating, as it was mostly description of room after description of room, with very little to break it up. It seemed to me almost as if King, having researched the time period extensively, didn't want to leave out the slightest detail. So, clearly,the pacing was poor, especially in the first third of the book or so. Not until an attempt on Marsh's life are we involved in the story, and that doesn't come until about 130 pages in.        Another problem is the characters which populate the novel. Many of the secondary characters are presented in monotone; for example, there is little said of Phillida Darling that does anything other than underline her tediousness and adherence to the social conventions of an aspiring socialite. The annoying characters are unfailingly annoying, while the members of Holmes' team are unfailingly good-hearted. Marsh's lesbian wife Iris is particularly gratingly good at everything and virtuous.     The actual villain is only not obvious because he is conspicuously absent from the scene throughout the book. I don't know that he had a single line of dialogue-not a very interesting character, to say the least. Since the wheels of justice are turning inexorably, we get the idea that the villain will definitely be captured, and his identity becomes completely trivial.        Holmes himself was humanized in the first Russell novel, which I can live with. However, I felt that in this novel there was nothing left of his exceptional abilities at all; anything that resembled the specific powers of deduction for which he is famous (induction, as all big fans know) is wasted on completely unimportant details, such as the fact that a letter was carried for a while before it was posted. The sole exception is when he applies himself to a game bird that has been shot, noting from the angle of various wounds that it had actually been shot twice. His expert disguise tactics also get a workout when he poses as a priest to make contact with an unsuspecting suspect. But for the most part, his near-supernatural powers of observation have dried up, it would appear. Russell, for her part, is gifted at reading the intentions and motives of people, based on their gestures and mannerisms. This is interestingas a counterpoint to Holmes' powers of analyzing evidence and constructing logical chains of thought; as a stand-alone act, it seems unrealistic, a worse fault given that the only reason to rob Holmes of his powers is in the service of realism.        For the most part, the mystery in this book is uncovered by tedious travel to witnesses who bear information waiting to be imparted. This is not very interesting detective work.        All of this might be forgiven, if the key evidence in their case, a marriage certificate, wasn't stumbled upon by Russell completely by accident moments before acquisition of the evidence becomes critical to presenting the climax. This was so shockingly artificial that I thought it must be a misdirection, but sadly it was meant to be swallowed.        My final complaint (the last one I feel like noting, anyhow) is that the villain, Ivo Hughenfort, is hopelessly outnumbered and outclassed, thereby preventing quite a bit of suspense. A lone criminal against a large team of outstanding detective, who are blessed with superior resources in every field imaginable, is a huge underdog. I want the villain to be an underdog only when it is in the service of mythologizing the hero; in this case, he was an underdog for no reason other than to give lots of characters their props.     What I learned:   The Lord of an estate in early 20th century England had a kind of alliance with the people of his area. They looked to him for guidance, leadership, and resources when they were in need, repaying the debt with their deference and fealty. At some point, tax laws made the agricultural resources that an estate typically had completely unable to provide for the system, and so the nobility had to turn to other enterprises in order to maintain revenue.	2004-11-03

Mowat relates excerpted tales from his childhood, most of which center around his unusual dog, Mutt. Mutt seems to be a once-in-a-lifetime kind of dog, whose unusual personality manifests itself in everything from duck hunting to cat chasing. Towards the end of the book, with the majority of Mutt's exploits behind him, the book expands to include stories of other pets, most notably a pair of great horned owls. The final chapter has the inevitable death of Mutt, although the details of his demise under the wheels of a runaway truck aren't given graphically.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />I didn't really enjoy this book very much, although my age might have something to do with it. Actually, I don't even believe that because the completely unnecessary verbosity asks for a certain amount of sophistication from the reader, and anyone smart enough to swallow the big words is probably not going to be open to the message. The grand verbiage is related to my other big problem with the book, which is that the mythic legends of the dog are almost certainly inflated. Mowat instills his dog with so much human character and emotion that it would have been more believable if it turned out to be a man in a dog suit. Yet, he pooh poohs another naturalist for \\"presuming to know what an animal is thinking,\\" with no apparent irony. Also, Mowat's sense of humor and self-importance are both extremely irritating. The humor is like a broad physical comedy in its lack of subtlety, and it's couched in so many words that it sounds like a foppish English gentleman failing miserably at a dinner conversation.  <br />On the positive side, it did seem like Mutt was a special dog, hyperbole aside, and it was interesting to get slice of life stories about a budding naturalist in Canada in the 1930s.  <br />	2004-11-03

It is re-issued every 20 years, and presumably updated with more modern material. <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />As an adult with an interest in such things, I thought that the book was interesting as a reference. There were a handful of somewhat obscure sayings that I had heard of, either as a childhood and an adult, and seeing these in black and white was kind of exciting. But from that perspective, I wanted more information about where each verse came from, and what might have motivated its survival. So, it's usefulness as a reference was very limited. On the other hand, it didn't necessarily do well as entertainment either, because of the sheer volume of nonsense rhymes that quickly began to blur into each other. Explicatory text between rhymes, or even between chapters, would have made the book less of a slog. As it was, I was just skimming each verse, looking for the gems. Also, this early edition of the book had some racist shadings on a few of the rhymes. As a repository of history, I support inclusion rather than omission; however, the illustrations created specifically for the book were objectionable in my mind, and the target audience is apparently children, so they should probably be purged.  <br />It was interesting to me to noted that the customer reviews on Amazon were from three lone rabid fans, who each said that they loved the book as children themselves. I suppose that I shouldn't pooh-pooh the entertainment value for children, as the effect is similar to a collection of nursery rhymes.  <br />	2004-11-03

Against a background of sinful luxury, Ethan attempts to unravel the nature of a threat indicated by a series of disturbing packages. Ultimately, he finds himself pitted against a cheerfully psychopathic anarchist named Corky, who is intent on kidnapping and killing Aefric, the son of the face. The extra element that really makes this tick is the morally ambiguous interference of Duncan, an old friend of Ethan who may or may not have died before he walked out of the hospital morgue. Duncan describes himself to Aefric as a guardian angel, but there is reason to believe that he is actually on the side of darkness. In the end, the anarchist finds himself in a fight to the death with Ethan.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />This is a very strong showing by Koontz, who evades most of his stereotypical devices and yet still manages to deliver a solid set of characters and an intriguing supernatural element. The annoying bantering dialogue is kept to an absolute minimum, and what banter there is seems more believable for its sparseness. There are also introduced elements that all ring true; Ethan enlists the aid of a hulking cop who is concerned about the potential negative impact on his career, for example. The villain is a high point, as is regular for Koontz, with a cheerful dedication to anarchy that leads him to perform little acts of vandalism even as he plans his larger acts of destruction. The setting is interesting, with the mansion of the Face continually impressing us with its opulence. And the villain didn't seem as hopelessly outmatched as Koontz villains often do, perhaps because we believe that Duncan may be helping him. There are also mysteries and revelations that come at just the right time; secrets are kept until the very end. The pacing is, as always, superb. <br />	2004-11-03
468234:US	20422170	R2FVQYZSF3R61J	0609801821	316008530	A Natural History of Parenting: A Naturalist Looks at Parenting in the Animal World and Ours	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Intriguing look into both parenting and nature	Naturalist Susan Allport takes a look at parenting in all animals, humans included, from a genetic evolutionary perspective. She discusses the different strategies animals have for choosing a mate, choosing a nest, hatching eggs versus bearing live young, and rearing their young. With every stage of exploration, she includes a discussion of how humans fit into this complex world.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />This was a very good book, and I'm considering it as a present for parents I know.  <br />One of the nice things about this book is that Allport manages to insert her own experiences into the book without seeming egotistical. I'm not sure whether women have a special talent for this, or whether my own male ego is offended by the intrusions of other male egos into my reading material, but I definitely notice a gender trend with regards to that quality of nature writing.  <br />Allport manages to touch on a lot of interesting material in detail, with only a slight tendency towards dryness. She mixes in a good amount of interesting examples with her discussion of selfish gene theories. In my option, though, she may not have had to take us through the evolution of scientific thinking, and I would have rather had the information confined to what we think now. The sole exception to this reservation is when she is talking about how a flawed scientific study was the basis for a revolution in birthing practices in hospitals in England and around the world.  <br />What I learned: <br />So much information was crammed into this book that it's too much to provide all of the examples that are interesting. But a few standouts include: almost every aspect of parenting behavior has the purpose of reproducing the genes of the parent, whether this means selfless devotion to the young, or the abandonment of an offspring, to that offspring's fatal detriment. This is true both of behavior and physiology. Humans have evolved to give \\"premature\\" birth to an undeveloped baby withan amazing capacity for development and learning.  <br />	2004-11-03

The book is written in a journal format, with entries covering such diverse topics as Packer's current studies into lions, a visit to Jane Goodall's chimp research site in Gombe, and hosting a conference of scientists in an effort to get a macro-perspective of the Serengeti. The book offers insight into the working conditions of the field scientist in a foreign country, which can be full of danger and obstacles.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />The journal format relieved expectations of a traditional storyline, and I liked that. I also liked the holistic view of a scientist's life; we get to see everything from the research as it is being performed to inter-scientist squabbles to dealings with politics and bureaucracy, all enormous parts of Packer's life. The writing was run-of-the-mill, with an amateurish attempt at high-mindedness that rises above adequate only occasionally. A man on a journey across the world with three young women, leaving his wife behind, is necessarily on the spot, and he makes frequent references to his wife and never mentions anything about the physical characteristics of the three young women. I don't even know what color hair they had. And this is mixed up with the common problem of the author being a little self-centered with the writing at times. Packer is never shown to lose his temper (with one heroic exception), or lust after another woman, or act selfishly, or chicken out, and I just think that rings a little false. Maybe a lot false.  <br />One particular thing that stuck out to me as a drawback was Packer's decision to intercut a flashback story about four students who were captured from Gombe by a military group, who held them as hostages. The story would have been fascinating if it were told all in one go; told in pieces of flashback, it is both confusing and anticlimactic.  <br />   One section of the book that I particularly liked was the description of a group of scientists coming together to create a computer model to predict the rhythms of life on the Serengeti.  <br />What I learned: <br />Lion life is centered around related groups of females, who form a nucleus that is utilized by the current reigning group of allied males. Incoming males will kill the cubs of the males they've just displaced. In the Ngorongoro Crater, a plague induced by a biting fly wiped out ninety percent of the lions, resulting in a tradition of inbreeding since the sixties. It is difficult to get needed supplies in Tanzania, which is only just coming into its own as a capitalist country. The original group of chimps that Goodall worked with split into two groups, and then the larger group started going out on raids designed to kill individual males of the smaller group. They literally tore apart Goliath, the oddly bold chimp that allowed the process of habituation to begin, and eventually they annexed the entire range and two of three females from the smaller group (all six males were killed).  <br />	2004-11-03

This is a great book, and probably my favorite in the Wayside School series. The stories are phenomenally quirky, and maintain an upbeat sense of optimism without preaching at all. Nearly all of the chapters work as stand-alone stories, although their degree of interrelatedness grows towards the end. For me, there were two standout stories. In the first, a boy is sent to the counselor because he can't stop himself from pulling Leslie's pigtails. He is hypnotized to stop, but also to see her ears as delicious candy when she uses the word pencil. In the last few paragraphs, Leslie breaks her pencil point, sharpens it, and then drops it beneath Paul's desk, but never uses the word pencil, ending the story without the expected climax. In the other one, a substitute teacher arrives with a third nostril, through which he sucks up the voice of every child as he or she speaks. Eventually the cafeteria worker Miss Mush saves the day with a Pepper-Pie-induced sneezing fit returning things to normal. I am so glad that one of Sachar's books was made into a movie that I enjoyed, because otherwise I would never have heard of him. <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />The writing is accessible and funny, to both young people and adults. The level of silliness is perfect, although there is one schmaltzy moment at the end that seemed out of whack with the rest of the book. But since this is an isolated incident, I'll give it a pass; kids will probably eat it up anyhow, and a book of thirty stories can afford to have one strong moral, I suppose.  <br />	2004-11-03

At this library, books by writers who can never hope to be published are given a place in the world. The librarian lives in the library, always answer the silver bell which signifies some new aspirant. They are treated kindly, and told that they can leave their book on any shelf once it has been entered into the registry. The narrator falls in love with Vida, a shy and awkward girl who is trapped in the body of what may be the most beautiful woman on earth. They live together happily for a period of months until she becomes pregnant, necessitating a trip to an abortion doctor in Tijuana, which is also the librarian's first exit from the library in three years.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />What a breath of fresh air. Brautigan's book just sails right by, with every page containing a reason to smile or visualize a stunning metaphor. As with his Hawkline Monster, this is a slightly surreal world in which whimsy overtakes reason. Positives include interesting and believable characters, awesome metaphors, witty dialogue, and a good feel for pacing. The flavor of the book is similar to Kerouac in that there is a sense of wild abandon and randomness that moves the characters along, but it is far superior in almost every aspect.  <br />If I had to choose a negative, I guess I would say that I was slightly confused at the ending, in which the librarian has become a hero on a college campus. I don't get a sense of why he is needed or held up, because he is no longer a librarian. Also, Brautigan includes himself as a character, and that's just too self-indulgent.  <br />	2004-11-03
468533:US	20422170	R84QKJFYTWNKI	0553104586	606595727	The Trigger	Books	4	3	6	N	N	Clarke & Baxter  at the top of their game	A group of scientists given free reign to explore their heart's desires are attempting to devise a tractor beam when they accidentally stumble upon emission of a field that detonates all explosives. The story tracks the political intrigue surrounding a discovery that will rewrite modern warfare, and the scientific refinements that play into this intrigue. Eventually, the Trigger gives way to the Jammer, which renders explosives useless without detonating them. Everyone seems happy with the exception of military warhawks, and domestic militia and gun rights advocates, who scheme in various ways to blunt the spread of the devices. In the chilling conclusion, a further refinement to the technology gives the controller the ability to kill any creature whose DNA is on file.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />This is perhaps the best Arthur C. Clarke book I've read, with the possible exception of 2001, and I'm only saying that because 2001 is so famous. Clarke's vision of the science and the potential cultural impacts is apparent throughout, and that is completely entertaining. He's also somehow successfully integrated a lot of social-benefit philosophical arguments into the dialogue without it appearing to be too contrived, and that is entertaining. The attention to detail when presenting the inner workings of the scientist's lab and, especially, the military, are entertaining. I suspect his writing partner had a lot to do with the humanity of the characters; unlike his previous novels, this one read like a mainstream political thriller, and things like a love story were handled with a professional touch so that they didn't intrude on the storyline. All of those things were so well done that the book was a joy to read. <br />The drawbacks, however, were all the more glaring in this context. The gun advocates are all shown to be crazy and delusional by the end of the novel, resorting to murder in the face of a losing battle (there is an exception to this, but it proves the rule). This seemed more jarring at the tail end of a lot of intellectual discussion about the issues of gun control. The book also kind of leaves us hanging. One of the thing I liked about \\"The Lights of Other Days\\" is that the book projected far enough into the future that you got a very clear grasp of the furthest-reaching impacts of society. This is lacking here.  <br />What I learned: <br />The issues surrounding gun ownership remain muddied. A scientist who creates an invention of military significance has virtually no chance of keeping the government out of dictating its use.  <br />	2004-11-03
468568:US	20422170	R2B12HBF1UDOMR	0805042989	468685495	The Raptor and the Lamb: Predators and Prey in the Living World	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Interesting look into Nature's nooks and crannies	Author McGowan takes the reader through various groupings of life on earth in order to examine the relationship between predators and their prey. Mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, arthropods, plants, insects, plankton and dinosaurs all take their turn in the spotlight as McGowan selects some of the more interesting predator/prey relationships among them. The chapters each contain an italicized graphic illustration of a predator doing its thing, and a discussion of that predator along with others in its class. For the most part, the discussion describes the behavior and physical characteristics that contribute to the success of the predator, and also notes the strategies that the prey employs to foil the predator. While the writing breaks down the information into laymen's terms, McGowan occasionally delves into a slightly more technical issue, and defines vocabulary and scientific concepts accordingly.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />I have a lot of negative feedback on this book, and I think that it generally comes down to the fact that the book was written and edited sloppily, as much as it pains me to knock the achievement of a likable English-Canadian gentleman who is obviously well-versed in the subject matter. But I noticed at least two or three word usage (such as team for teem, infection for infestation) errors, and, more glaringly, the italicized prose was just not consistently presented. I thought that McGowan was making up the scenes as exemplary of the typical predator foray, but in the chapter on plankton, the flowery writing is used to describe McGowan and a group of students collecting plankton from the sea. A final italicized section talks about a British man working on his garden and interacting with his wife and infant son. While I felt that the language in the sections was too flowery to be considered good writing, the bigger distraction was wondering where they came from, and why they weren't presented in a consistent format. If they are thingsthat McGowan has seen with his own eyes, how can dinosaurs be included? If he's making them up as exemplary, then why are there atypical situations presented which then have to be corrected with the non-italicized writing? And why would he insert one, and possibly two stories from his own life? Further complicating matters is the fact that sometimes the non-italicized prose seems to serve the same function as the italicized prose, namely to provide a descriptive illustration of the concepts discussed. But even that definition doesn't hold, because the plankton-collecting story differs from the others in that there are no predators or prey being described. If there is some sort of logic involved in their conception and presentation, I still object to them based on their overwrought language and mysterious origins. Amusingly, McGowan gives a sort of disclaimer in the introduction, letting us know that the presentation of certain gory details may be off-putting, but is nevertheless necessary. When I read it, I expected that the discussion would be a little graphic. But, it seems like the disclaimer pertains to some very gratuitous choices of phrase in the italicized text that is not essential to any aspect of the book.  <br />     On the good end of it, the subject matter is fascinating, and the bulk of the text is both accessible and informative.  <br />What I learned: <br />Sperm whales may stun their prey with sonic blasts before eating them. Plants have hairs in order to discourage insect predators; some of them serve to expose more of an egg sac to the air, which reduces the success of the hatchlings, and others might break off into a waxy substance that accumulates on the legs of aphids and other insect predators. Some bugs eat poisonous plants and then use the poison to protect themselves from bigger predators. Killer whales are smart enough to cooperatively splash the water in order to tip over an ice floe with a seal on it. Lions are slower than their prey, but compensate by having a better acceleration when they start; so, if a lion is within 50 yards of its prey, it has a good chance of taking it down.  <br />	2004-11-03

In other words, most of earth has been suddenly transformed to a time of prehuman hominids, with a few isolated chunks of mankind surviving from the time of recorded history. In what may or may not be a coincidence, two of the mightiest armies of history have been preserved at their peak of power, in the same general region of the world. Humans from the year 2037 find themselves in the camps of Genghis Khan and his Mongolian hordes on one side, and the Macedonian army of Alexander the Great on the other. The book climaxes with an enormous battle between the two forces, with the fate of the new world hanging in the balance. With the battle over, the basic problem still remains: what the hell happened to earth, and can it be undone? Not by the end of the book, apparently, although this is supposed to be the first in a series. <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />Arthur Clarke, writing with partner Stephen Baxter, has done it again. He's taken an intriguing premise, thrown in a wide range of interesting characters, and moved the story along at a brisk trot that makes it a page-turner for pretty much anyone. Many of his books appeal to the scientific discovery side of people, but this book is for historian geeks all the way. The what-if nature of the battle between two of mankind's greatest armies is just a pleasure to read, with fine attention being paid to the minute details of war and everyday life for the characters from various eras. A solid idea backed up by solid writing is so rare, and so enjoyable, that I was instantly on the internet looking for the other books in this series. Regrettably, this was just published, so I have a while to wait. Surprisingly, this was written with the same partner who brought us The Lights of Other Days, in which the characters were notably weak. Maybe there were just enough characters here,and enough action, that their shortcomings weren't as obvious or important. One minor quibble: the character of Rudyard Kipling is a little sappy at times, and also keeps quoting incidents from his childhood, as if Clarke just didn't want to see his research go to waste.  <br />What I learned: <br />Almost nothing about Kipling, surprisingly. Alexander the Great lived 1000 years before Genghis Khan. An up-close look at the dirty, smelly life of a nomadic horse-oriented tribe of warriors. The structure of the army was interesting: everyone was in charge of ten people beneath him, with the top ten reporting to the Khan himself. <br />	2004-11-03

He weaves anecdotes and scientific studies together flawlessly to draw conclusions that are hard to argue with, if only because he refuses to draw unwarranted conclusions when the evidence isn't clear. He personally studies ravens in his northeastern home area, in Alaska, and in Germany to note the differences between different populations of the animal. He also draws extensively on his observations from his own aviary, where it seems he is at times obsessively painstaking in recording nuances of behavior that would fly over the heads of the average bird owner.     The Good and the Bad:  This book has been done right, with a real attempt to keep the reader's interest without compromising the scientific value of the work. The information given is enough to be compelling without being too boring about statistics. The end of the book gets a little more tilted towards hard science, with a fairly in-depth discussion about what warrants consciousness and intelligence, but there's no other conclusion that would be appropriate.     On the bad side, there are very occasional forays into self-indulgence, as when he takes the opportunity to argue the comments of a peer reviewer who contributed to the rejection of the publication of his study, or when a not-so-funny joke is recounted.     What I learned:  The raven is a remarkable animal, and consciousness evolves for as much of a specific reason as anything else. One bird might be given all of the instinct necessary to operate within a very narrow range of activity, but shorted on additional brain tissue, which is costly to maintain. But the raven has evolved to develop food gathering skills through problem-solving, which allows it to be much more flexible in its approach to food gathering, social interactions, and defense. This hardwired ability to solve problems manifests itself as curiosity, a desire to play, and the ability to visualize consequences without actually performing the action; this last is the most compelling criterion for awareness.     Other interesting raven facts: They can count to as high as seven. They hunt items ranging from ground squirrels to baby seals, but subsist mostly on the carrion provided by bigger predators. They lack the physical ability to pierce skin, and so have to eat through natural body openings or wounds. They have a collaborative relationship with other predators, generally wolves, which results in the ravens possibly directing the wolves to a kill so that they can take their share. This has a strange effect where they're actually uncomfortable eating from a carcass that lacks a predator as a feeding partner. This relationship has been transferred to other species where wolves are scarce, ranging from human hunters to polar bears to, possibly, a cougar, which seemed to be led to a human by a raven hoping to feast on the aftermath of a human kill. The problem-solving abilities were best demonstrated by the fact that a raven, when confronted with a piece of meat dangling from a string, will pull the string up by degrees so that it can reach the meat.	2004-11-03

What seems to be a global alien invasion is characterized by flying spacecraft and a monstrous alien ecology growing up around them in mere hours, along with a host of supernatural occurrences like dolls that talk and tear out their own eyes. Molly and Neil soon find purpose in this nightmarish world; they plan to rescue children from the terrors which surround them, and are aided by supernaturally smart dogs, which seem to sense their purpose. Over that long night, they skirmish with all sorts of scary things while shepherding children from spot to spot in the small Colorado town. In the morning, however (or is it the following morning?), all the alien life forms have mysteriously vanished, taking with them pretty much every adult who was not directly involved in saving the children. Molly and Neil hook up with other saviors and groups of children, and head south to start a new world. Only in the end does Molly reflect on the invasion and experience an epiphany; the alien conquest was actually judgment day, and the souls of the earth have been taken to heaven or hell.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />This book is a prime example of good suspense narrative, with every page demanding to be turned and every chapter ending in a cliffhanger. Character development is perfunctory as the horrible alien landscape asserts itself, dominating everything in the reader's perception. The plot is fairly straightforward, and we are able to concentrate on the dangers as they come. The writing is in service to this one aim, to paint this global picture and to bring us into the minds of those who must experience it. I liked that there was one main ongoing storyline, and just one main character, which is fleshed out enough to have some character without wallowing in self-realization. I liked the monsters themselves, because thinking about weird alien life and how an extraterrestrial ecology might work is cool and fun. In this book, Koontz trades off his humor for a little extra horror, and I think that this is a value neutral judgment on his part. Some levity would have been appreciated, but would also have lessened the intensity of the experience.  <br />   I also like the contemporary references to Kill Bill, M, Night Shyamalan, etc.  <br />   On the bad side, I could have done without the superhuman dogs, a development that seemed both superfluous and unrealistic (in a different way than the other surrealism, obviously). Also, there were a couple of supernatural phenomena that didn't sit well with me, particularly the tendency of the evil monsters to quote T.S. Eliot to Molly. An appearance by her murdering father is likewise rather ho-hum. There was a trend of people being made to kill themselves, and I would have liked to see that better-developed as well (just explained more, not more suicides). And, the biggest flaw in the book for me was the surprise twist ending, which shows us that the invasion was actually judgment day. I didn't enjoy this at all; it felt gimmicky and was simply beside the point of the action. I could see that the genesis of the book (no pun intended) probably lay in the inversion of an Arthur C. Clarke quotation, which, paraphrased, is that seeing the technological capabilities of an advanced alien civilization would be like seeing magic or miracles. Koontz has the nifty idea of making an actual supernatural event, that of judgment day, seeming like an alien invasion. It's a cool idea, but I think the aliens were just a little cooler.  <br />   Another problem I had was that Koontz is pushing a conservative agenda, with major knocks against environmentalism in some of the early chapters.  <br />	2004-11-03

At the end of the fifth book in the series, Susannah has been spirited to New York, 1999 by the pregnant woman living in her mind, Mia, in order to rendezvous with some bad guys and to have their baby. The remaining gunslingers split into two teams; Roland and Eddie go to Maine, 1977, to pursue Calvin Tower, whose life they must save in order to keep ka rolling. Meanwhile, Jake and Oy team up with Salem's Lot hero Father Callahan (who goes by Pere Callahan these days) to New York, 1999 to rescue Susannah. Susannah occupies most of the book, which would ordinarily be disappointing, but turns out to be absolutely riveting as she wrests for control of the situation in which Mia and her opponents have all the cards. Roland and Eddie get a fair amount of screen time as well, blasting through a battalion of mobsters and eventually meeting up with Stephen King, who has authored their very existence (perhaps). Jake and Pere are short-shrifted spacewise, but make a quick and intense journey to the lair in which Susannah is held. Not wholly unexpectedly, the book ends on another cliffhanger, with Jake and Pere about to bust into a nest of supernatural goons with animal body parts, Susannah and Mia are in the throes of childbirth (the child, Mordred, is Roland's son and is also prophesied to kill him); and Roland and Eddie are headed through Maine, seeking a way to rejoin the others. Thank goodness chapter seven is published in about two weeks (9-21-04).  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />Admittedly, I just put the book down which is sometimes indicative of bad judgment on my part, but I am completely captive to this series. The characters are richly drawn, the inclusion of King as a character is quirky and interesting, the plot burns through pages like a wildfire, and there wasn't a single scene in which I found myself bored. Also, we are finally getting some satisfying answers to the rules that bind this universe together, although more questions are raised, of course.  <br />Criticisms? This was a little short compared to most of the other novels, and I understand that he wrote it directly before launching into the final chapter. And so I hope he didn't gyp us of a few pages just in order to get the damn thing off his chest.  <br />	2004-11-03

The continuing adventures of Sam Gribley, who left his life in the civilized world to go live on a homestead on a mountain when he was just a young teenager. The first book dealt with Sam overcoming the harshest of conditions in his new life and coming to terms with his family, who initially want him back. With that conflict settled, this book centers around two interlocked crises; first, Sam's peregrine falcon companion is taken by a thief posing as a conservation officer; second, Sam's younger sister Alice disappears (she has been living with him for a while now), and he decides to track her down.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />I may have just gotten to this book too late to derive the childhood joy that it is meant to impart. The characters all seemed wooden, the plot contrived and predictable, and the action unrealistic. The original book was one of my favorites as a young boy, and I imagine that I just missed the boat on this one. I did enjoy some of the ingenious survival skills Sam employed, and also liked that I can now recognize a few of the plant names that Sam mentions. And it is also a little thrilling to me to recognize that the tale takes place in the Catskill mountains, not far from my own childhood home. From outside the book, I can praise its politics, which are indicated by a bevy of strong female characters and a pure environmentalist ethic put into practical living.  <br />	2004-11-03
474001:US	20422170	R1Q6QU7ZFF39EO	1582343853	372577569	Rats: Observations on the History and Habitat of the City's Most Unwanted Inhabitants	Books	5	26	30	N	N	Almost perfect	Robert Sullivan relates his experiences as he delves into rats, with the focus being on the role that rats play in history and modern culture rather than dwelling on the nuances of rat behavior. He spends nights in a forgotten alleyway in New York, watching the rats as they emerge from their burrows to take advantage of the local restaurant waste. He spends time with exterminators (or \\"pest control specialists,\\" as the industry leaders prefer), whether they work for small companies or large ones. And, apparently, he spends time at the library, digging up historical information that is at times so obscure that you wonder how he ever found it as it relates to his subject.          But Sullivan's book, peppered with literary quotes from the likes of Thoreau and Emerson, is ultimately less about rats and more about people. The rats are a fascinating hook, and every time a rodent skitters across the page, Sullivan invites us to squirm along with him. But more often, the reader is treated to quirky episodes in American history, in which the rats play some sort of role.          The black plague, the era of Gangs of New York, the American Revolution, the labor movement, and anti-Chinese sentiments at the turn of the century are just some of the subjects of Sullivan's stories, and he tells them all with a master's flair.     The Good and the Bad:       This is one of the best nonfiction books I've ever read, edging out Hillenbrandt's Seabiscuit, and rivaling Kurlansky's Cod and the works of Bill Bryson. Sullivan knows how to tell an interesting story, and he has chosen a subject which rivets our attention no matter how it is presented. Putting the two elements together leads to a lot of compulsive page-turning.          Sullivan has that rare ability to reach deep into the history books and pull out the most engaging anecdotes, and yet find the connection to his story that merits the inclusion.         He also possesses the rare ability to insert himself into the story without dwelling on himself.  While much of the book involves his personal interactions with the world, he never strays into the grandstanding that so many authors seem to find impossible to resist.          The book is mostly tangents, and there are footnotes that lead to tangents from the tangents, and endnotes that add yet another layer of side stories. But that's okay, because this is a journey that is far more pleasurable than any destination could be.          If I had to pick a nit about this one (and I like to present a little criticism on everything I read), I would say that I was surprised that there weren't more personal stories about people who aren't related to the rat industry, and their dealings with rats. He relates the rat story of an acquaintance who finds a rat in his bathroom, and it is one of the most entertaining sections in the book. I can't help but think that there are other stories out there that would have been worthy of inclusion.         Similarly, I would have liked to have learned a little more about the rats themselves, as pertains to their social structure and other areas of interest from a naturalist perspective. For example, he mentions a couple of times that a starving rat colony will begin to cannibalize itself, but there's no in-depth description of this phenomenon.          These are small concerns compared to the overall level of success that the book enjoyed. You know a book is good when you don't think anything should be taken out of it; you just want more and more. I'm definitely going to go look up other works by Sullivan now that I've been introduced to his writing.	2004-10-29
474078:US	20422170	R2Q8888XYPDF	0446677906	346578458	Flashfire (Parker Novels)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Parker is a great entertaining read	Parker is a tough guy among tough guys, and the difference really comes out when he is betrayed by his fellow thieves, as is the case in Flashfire. After pulling a job, Parker's three conspirators \\"borrow\\" his money against his will in order to pull off an even bigger heist months down the line. Parker opts out of the big heist, which he has doubts about, but is in on a revenge plot, which propels him through a one man crime spree and eventually lands him in a posh Floridian neighborhood where the rules are written by old money. He is waiting to kill his three enemies, but others are out to kill him as well, and then the law gets involved. Parker is the ultimate pragmatist when it comes to accomplishing what he has set out to do; the rule of ethics that drives him is a little less practical and a little murkier. But in the end, it's one man against many, in a house full of guns. <br /> The Good and the Bad: <br />     This is the nineteenth Parker novel, but the first one I have read, so I was a newcomer in some respects. But I chose the book because I loved the film Payback, which was based on a different Parker novel.  <br />     I think that seeing the movie was a benefit, because the character descriptions were pretty weak, and it was nice to have Mel Gibson's performance to hang my mental image on.  <br />     Character descriptions aren't what you pick up a book like this for anyway; this is a modern crime noir, and I got the elements I was looking for: compelling and varied action scenes, crisp writing, and cool dialogue. Parker himself is intriguing because of his relentless drive and obsession, and the overall style of  the book reminded me of Louis Lamour.  <br />     If your protagonist is a thief (a mechanic, in Parker parlance), you need to have a world full of unsympathetic citizenry, and Stark gives us unflattering glimpses of a social elite in which the young are just waiting for the rich to die.  <br />     Overall, a very solid book, and I look forward to catching up on some of the back stories. It has a kind of timeless appeal that doesn't seek to hit us over the head with how modern it can be; yet it isn't a period piece rooted in the pop-culture of the day.  <br />	2004-10-29

The girl next door in the trailer park turns out to be the child of a psychopathic murderer (she is also disabled). This story intersects with the tale of a boy named Curtis who is on the run from a pack of otherworldly killers. Curtis himself is eventually revealed to be an alien.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />This book has a lot of stuff going for it, including a couple of interestingly layered characters (including another tough-as-nails detective), and the genuinely exciting twin plot points: life on the lam by a young runaway alien contrasted with the dilemma of a disabled-yet-precocious girl who is about to be murdered by her father.  <br />   The ending is also good, with a satisfying glimpse of a group of adventurers banded together to save the world.  <br />   My problems included an injection of God that seemed unnecessary, a dramatically out-gunned and outclassed villain, and of course, lots and lots of bad dialogue. I don't understand why every good guy who isn't simpleminded seems to engage in a brand of witty banter that puts them into the chair of a late night talk show host. I'm not sure whether to like the characters of the twin Vegas showgirls who are simultaneously beautiful and superhumanly capable. They are supposed to be so over-the-top that they come right back to seeming real, but I don't know if that works. The same philosophy definitely does not work in the case of a grizzled westerner who has the bearings of a gold miner, but the job of a caretaker for a ghost town.  <br />   Koontz also rails against the philosophies of utilitarianism, while, in my mind, mischaracterizing them in the extreme.  <br />What I learned: Dean Koontz seems to be incapable of straying from the following elements: Disabled people with hearts of gold, hard-boiled detectives who are tough and moral without being successful, outnumbered villains who have no redeeming qualities, and dog companions.  <br />	2004-10-27
475725:US	20422170	R2E5PZUAJ41YS	0553580884	482330793	The Undertaker's Widow	Books	1	4	6	N	N	Good courtroom scenes can't carry rest of this novel	Written by a former criminal defense attorney, the book is a crime thriller that is meant to be a guilty pleasure on the order of John Grisham. <br />   I'm no fan of Grisham, and I found Margolin's undertaking to be rife with the same types of problems I have with Grisham. <br />   The protagonist in the book is Judge Richard Quinn, who finds himself drawn into a web of intrigue after he is assigned to hear a homicide case against Senator Ellen Crease, who is running a primary political campaign against Benjamin Gage (both republicans).  <br />   Quinn is seduced by a beautiful woman, who is then apparently murdered. He hides his knowledge of the murder for a variety of reasons, and then is blackmailed to rule against Senator Crease.  <br />   What follows is a series of \\"gotchas,\\" with the last two thirds of the book being crammed full with at least a dozen major plot twists that implicate different major players in both murders.  <br />   The plot twists are one of the major problems in the book. They are by turns boring and absurd. At first, suspicion could fall on any of a half dozen people. By the end, pretty much all of the suspects turn out to be guilty in some capacity, and I just wanted the book to end. For good measure, Quinn's adoptive father has a heart attack for absolutely no reason, and recovers with no perceptible impact on the plot. <br />   Another problem is the character development. There seems to be a trend in pulp fiction to blunt accusations of cardboard-two dimensionalism by giving an obligatory problem to each character. So, the Judge has marital problems, his wife is a workaholic, and the senator is too cold for her own good. Who cares? A real character has real depth, and that means more than being something good and something bad. A real character has minor concerns and major concerns. A real character is sloppy. Why must the villains have dirty houses and the heroes have neat houses?  <br />   This problem is exacerbated by the plodding dialogue, which is often presented as an exchange between two people with no framing words (such as \\"he said\\"). I like this type of exchange sometimes, but in this book, each conversation bore down relentlessly on covering the information that the author thinks we need to hear. Almost every bit of dialogue is crafted with a purpose, and the purpose is almost always to get a piece of information about a crime out to the reader. There is very little attempt to color the dialogue of any of the characters with a recognizable speech pattern, with the exception of a shy character who speaks haltingly. The only time anyone says \\"uh\\" is when they're lying. Mostly, the people speak in grammatically perfect sentences that sound like a rehearsed courtroom exchange. <br />   Next problem: chauvinism on the part of the author. The women in the book, invariably sexy, are described in lush detail. This would be okay if we saw everything from the point of view of Richard Quinn (oh, how that would have improved this book!), but there is a shifting point of view that never seems to linger on the physicality of the men in the same way as the women.  <br />   The point of view thing is reminding me of another annoying incident. The evidence first points to Ellen Crease being a victim in the murder of her husband. But then a forensic specialist in the lab notices something about the blood spatter patterns that doesn't jibe with Ellen's story. He tells the lead detective, but the audience is kept out of hearing what the inconsistency is. This is done awkwardly about three times with sentences like \\"Tom told Harry what Dick had noticed about the blood spatters,\\" and so I assumed that the revelation would be huge and shocking. But it wasn't at all. It was exactly what you would expect, just something about Crease's position in the room being different. And the evidence turns out to be inconclusive, because another expert says that, no, the spatter evidence could support Crease after all. There are dozens of other revelations that are equally important to the story that are not kept from the reader. Why Margolin chose this one I have no idea. <br />   So what's done right in this book? Not much. The one thing that I enjoyed was the insider's view on the courtroom experience, inasmuch as Margolin convincingly explains three briefs that sit before Judge Quinn that have an impact on the trial. The description and explanation of the briefs and other legal matters is done succinctly, clearly, and with great purpose.  <br />   If Margolin wants to write legal thrillers, he should spend 90% of his time in the courtroom, and leave the rest of the events in the background. That's the only way he's ever going to be thrilling. <br />	2004-10-27

Brigance is the center of a legion of competing pressures and concerns, including escalating involvement in the case by the Mississippi population of blacks, and by the Ku Klux Klan. We get an intimate look at the legal process, as Jake fights off other lawyers seeking to represent his client, attempts to manipulate the press, the judge, the prosecution, and the jury, and faces problems dealing with practicing law on a tight budget. He walks a fine moral line as the situation escalates, and eventually finds himself hiding out at a friends house while the Klan tries to murder him.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />     After reading two or three other novels by this author (including The Firm), I've been talking down John Grisham for years, but this book has made me revise my opinion of him. A preface tells us that this is Grisham's most personal work, and his first; I think that those two factors may be what makes this book stand out to me.  <br />     This book has a lot going for it. The pacing is well-done, mixing violence and action scenes in with the also-exciting twists and turns in the legal arena. The book slowly builds to a natural climax with the jury decision, and the obstacles and situations Jake faces are varied and inventive. The language and writing are also very serviceable, with appropriate amounts of description and dialogue (although there seems to be a near-obsessive tendency to include detailed descriptions of every meal and drink consumed by the characters). This writing gives the author the air of a seasoned professional rather than the first-timer he was at the time.  <br />     The book also contains enough nuanced ethical considerations to be the focus of a college ethics course. Time and again, Jake is confronted with moral decisions, and his decisions are allover the place ethically. At times, I was impressed with his morality; often, I was shocked at his immorality. The other characters are also instruments of moral dilemmas, not the least of which is Carl Lee's murder of the two rapists.  <br />     Another great aspect of the book was the authority with which the legal profession is presented. As a lawyer, Grisham clearly knows the ins and outs of the profession, and his insider view of jury selection, expert psychiatric testimony, and the way that lawyers compete for a desirable case are all fascinating.  <br />     On the down side, I have two major criticisms, and they both cropped up so frequently that they inhibited my ability to lose myself in the story. I didn't like Grisham's other novels because I felt that the characters weren't flawed enough to make them interesting. Jake is flawed, all right, and his flaws make him kind of detestable. Detestable might be too strong of a word, but certainly, he was less than sympathetic in many ways. He hungers for media attention, putting it above his client's best interests. He threatens to sever a friendship with a court administrative aid if she doesn't give him a list of prospective jurors that the judge has ordered her not to give him. He flirts with his beautiful legal assistant, and keeps her existence a secret from his wife. In fact, he keeps a lot of secrets from his wife, including the fact that the Klan has burned down their house. He stands idly by while a sheriff literally breaks the legs of a Klan member, and then jokes about it the next day. He seems to use the word nigger interchangeably with black man, and states prejudiced views, such as \\"nigger are unpredictable, especially when they're in trouble.\\" I could go on, but you get the point. This is a main character that's hard to root for. The other characters are generally interesting, but sometimes cartoonish, especially the prosecutor, a fat political aspirant whose main function seems to be getting blustered at Jake's shot-from-the-hip one liners. <br />     That leads to my other criticism, which is that too often, Grisham turns to the camera and winks, asking us to chuckle or give an affirming cheer. Every time we see Brigance confront Buckley, the exchange ends in Jake getting the last word in, and it infuriating Buckley. Things like this, extending to several plot points, are just a little too pat.  <br />     Overall, an enjoyable novel that should help you burn some midnight oil. <br />	2004-10-27

The book's main premise is that the domestication of animals was a necessary stepping-stone to civilization, giving early man the ability to transport themselves and possessions for long distances, and also providing enough meat to take man beyond a hand-to-mouth existence. The book covers animals including horses, cows, pigs, reindeer, sheep, goats, chickens, bees, silkworms, dogs, elephants, cats, turkeys, geese, swans, ducks, rabbits, pigeons, rats, mice, camels, and, as they say, much, much more.  <br /> <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />This book has a premise that I find interesting: a look at the history of mankind through a specific focus. The weaknesses of the book are that the argument that people couldn't have gotten anywhere without animals is kind of at once obvious and unproven. Surely, having animals made things significantly easier, but it's difficult to say that civilization wouldn't have gotten going eventually anyhow. The book is also kind of redundant, because so many of the animals have such a similar history and impact that in some ways, reading about sheep makes reading about goats much less interesting. Also, in many of the cases, there is simply very little known about the domestication process, leaving many gaps to be filled with speculation. On the positive side, there were so many interesting facts that some sections of the book were nothing less than fascinating. Caras does a good job of bringing home again and again how a relationship that we've taken for granted happened only with great effort, and a significant sacrifice on the part of early man and the animals in question.  <br />What I learned: <br />Reindeer are weird animals, hunting lemmings and eating human urine. Cows are descended from Aurochs, which were three times the size of the cattle we breed today. Thereare probably no wild horses left in the world, with the possible exception of the outer limits of Siberia. The black rat was responsible for the black plague, but was supplanted by the brown rat that we know today. The definition of domestication that he works with involves the breeding of wild stock to produce favorable traits that make the separate gene pools measurably different.  <br />	2004-10-27

The invention and its effects on humanity are explored as they eventually unravel the secrets of the past, and alter the evolution of humans. Interspersed with this background is a human story involving a beautiful journalist, and the family of the entrepreneur including divorced wife, two sons, and their half-sister.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />Clarke hits a home run with the science fiction end of it, and this is purely where the good rating comes from. The futuristic world seems believable, and the technology is put to use to answer a whole host of questions that we have fun asking-what really happened to Jesus? What is the track of human evolution? What would the response be to a sudden and total lack of privacy? <br />The human stories, however, are cartoonish and leave much to be desired. The entrepreneur is like the guy from Jurassic Park, and none of the characters achieve more depth than the characters of that movie. An attempt is made, but it is ultimately poorly done, as is a plot involving a kidnapping and a physical struggle in the climax.  <br />What I learned: <br />The book is thought-provoking, and raises interesting hypothetical questions. What would it be like to strip away the lies we tell ourselves of our own past? Where in history and outer space would I travel? How much shame would I endure for my own past? <br />	2004-10-21

The book also undermines the notion of a liberal mainstream media. <br />Writing:  <br />In most cases, freaking hilarious. The first thirty or so pages literally made me laugh out loud a handful of times, and while the laugh density soon died down, the book never stopped being exciting. I read it all in one sitting, which is a testament to Franken's ability to absorb the reader. The facts also seem very well-researched, and Franken again and again draws a distinction between himself and his counterparts by hawking himself as the one who researches rather than lies.  <br />I agree with Amazon reviewers that a couple segments fell rather flat, as in the case of an extended fictional story in which his right-wing enemies who evaded the Vietnam draft bumble around in the war, led by Kerrey. <br />Conservatives have created a website that purports to refute many of the facts in Franken's book (frankenlies .com), and after reading everything on that website, it seems as if Franken is guilty of a few gaffes as well. But it's hard to trust the website, which at any rate is far more comfortable nitpicking minor points than addressing the major items in the book. In fact, even if you were to concede to the website everything that it claims, you would still be left with a very damning book.  <br />What I learned: That Coulter, Limbaugh, Cheney, Bush, O Reilly, Hannity and the others are complete liars who often just make s*** up. This is almost comical. What's more troubling is the hold that conservative and corporate America have begun to take on the media. He tracks the conglomeration of radio stations and family pig farmers, and the numbers of the last twenty years are astonishing. He also tracks the inversion of surplus to deficitthat Bush has created, drawing a grim picture of the future. <br />	2004-10-21

Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure (The 25th Anniversary Edition)	Books	5	2	5	N	N	A must-read	Summary: This is supposedly an abridgement of a classic Florentine tale by S. Morgenstern, but I'm not sure whether that's true or just a device to make the story more interesting. The main tale (within the tale of the abridgement) has been made into a popular movie. It involves a romance between Westley, a poor farm boy who lives as a servant on the estate of the parents of Buttercup, the most beautiful woman in the world. When he leaves to make his fortune, she is chosen as a bride by the odious Prince Humperdinck. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three thieves; Domingo Montoya, the master swordsman, Fezzik the gentle giant, and the Sicilian genius (*can't remember his name). Westley pursues them to kidnap her back, but is then captured in turn by Prince Humperdinck, who wants to finalize the wedding. The climax involves Fezzik and Domingo teaming up with Westley to save Buttercup from the prince. <br /> <br />The Good and The Bad: Very, very little to criticize here. Some of the frame story leaves us with a less favorable image of the author; to find that he is divorced and employed \\"tough love\\" on his son's too-ample girth is not the image of joviality we're hoping for. But the story within is, basically, flawless. The tongue-in-cheek humor is employed whenever the story starts to take itself too seriously. The fight scenes are compelling and graphic, and the characters merit a lot of emotional investment. <br />	2004-10-21

He also shares personal anecdotes, including a personal look inside the Nader campaign. <br />The Good and the Bad: Some of the arguments seemed strident, and even slanted, which is becoming a common criticism of Moore. On the other hand, the rip on the presidential election really got my dander up.  <br />What I learned: The 2000 election was unequivocally stolen. Moore had a good idea to use the power of the Nader campaign to modify the Bush campaign, but the Nader people wouldn't go for it.

After a period of time that seems alternately aimless and pleasurable, Bosch reopens a case file that's been gnawing at him all these years. He spends the rest of the book sleeping with a female cop, throwing his weight around on a Hollywood set peopled by animals, and eventually butting heads with the Department of Homeland Security. Even thought the Homeland Security stuff turns out to be less than central to the plot, it provides the most thrills because it gives Bosch time to shine as the ultimate underdog who never gives up. The climax involves a gang of murderers showing up at Bosch's house to take him out. Very fun! <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />The Bosch character remains someone I can get emotionally invested in. He is the strong silent type who can still listen to jazz in the night. His morality is always on display, and he always charges recklessly into danger, if that's what his morals tell him is the right thing to do. Bosch is just a pleasure to read about. <br />The downside in this particular outing was the convoluted storytelling, which I think got away from Connelly this time around. There are about two and a half plot twists too many, and the most entertaining stuff was ultimately not important to the story. A tighter plot might have been better. The convolutions of the plot eventually gave me enough of a headache that I didn't care so much about following the finer aspects of the police procedurals, or even the victim. <br />What I learned: <br />If this book is right, Homeland Security has way too much power to arrest and detain people who haven't been proven to be any kind of a threat. <br />	2004-10-21

By far the most entertaining material is to be found in the bear section, with other interesting stories about sharks and crocodiles. Some of the stories are told in the first person by the people who have had the harrowing experiences; others are more clinical in nature. <br />The Good and the Bad: Some of the essays were really excellent, particularly the ones told in the first person. The story of a geologist who lived after being partially eaten by a black bear was the best, and a journalistic story about a series of shark attacks was also very good. Another standout was the firsthand account of the lions of Tsavo. The scientific-sounding accounts, on the other hand, were generally boring, and redundant. The book would have been better with about five fewer selections. <br /> <br />What I learned: Snakes aren't really very dangerous, and will never pursue a man as prey. If you have to be attacked by an apex predator, a bear is preferable, as you have at least a chance of surviving. On the other hand, a crocodile is the worst, as a single bite generally ends your life.  <br />	2004-10-21

This book inspired me to give the author a second chance as one of my favored authors. The upshot: Odd Thomas can see dead people, much like the boy in Sixth Sense. They can't speak to him, but they can ask him to perform tasks for him through hand gestures. Thomas is a very funny, interesting character, whose offbeat sense of humor contributes to his reputation as a hometown eccentric in the tiny Texan town where he lives as a short order cook. He loves his short order cook job, and he loves his girlfriend, so his gift seems more like a distraction. He can not only see the dead, but also see a type of shadow-creature that seems to feed from the brand of misery spawned by death. The book covers a series of events that begin when a man (it's not clear whether he's dead or alive) starts stalking Thomas, at the same time that an extraordinary number of the shadows start showing up in town, indicating a mass disaster of some type.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />Almost everything in this book is good, because Koontz has once again deviated from his formula with great inventiveness and success. Sans gold-hearted children and knowing dogs, Koontz fills the space with an amazing narrator/character. The voice is pitch-perfect, and the supernatural element is at once familiar and mysterious. Misfires might include the incorporation of Elvis as one of the dead recurring characters, which seems a little cutesy for the context. The twist ending was simultaneously shocking and emotionally satisfying. 2003 is a very good year for Koontz. <br />	2004-10-21

The gold-hearted characters include a black woman who is raising the offspring created by her dead sister's rape, a pair of quirky brothers who fixate on different genres of mass human death, a latino maid with adorably bad English, the saintly and philanthropic \\"Pie Lady,\\" and a young boy who has the ability to travel between parallel dimensions.  The killer seemingly kills the detective, but is then haunted by what he thinks is the ghost of the murdered man.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />Usually, the deciding factor of a good Dean Koontz novel is whether the schmaltz outweighs the interesting plot points and supernatural occurrences. This book fails miserably, with the corny sentimentality completely overwhelming any of the potential interest in an intriguingly powerful boy. The power, incidentally, is a rehash of the power of Shep in By the Light of the Moon. The ghostly detective is interesting, but less so after we get an inside look at the ruse being pulled. We would prefer a supernatural explanation to the events; the mundane \\"reality\\" is, ironically, less realistic than a little hoodoo would have been. The death-obsessed brothers are completely unbelievable, and therefore boring. Plot threads seem pointless or undeveloped. Finally, the villain seems at a significant disadvantage, and this is never a good thing-how can one psychotic mortal hope to overcome the combined efforts of a supernatural boy, a cadre of protective adults, and a team of detectives that is closely monitoring his every move?  <br />   The good in this book is nearly completely confined to the character of the villain, whose villainy is revealed to us in a shocking and completely thrilling way. His reasoning is at once chilling and funny, and the book flows only when he the focus. The supernatural events that plague him are also fairly powerful until they are revealed as a sham.  <br />	2004-10-21

He slowly gets sucked into a web of intrigue as it turns out that she's missing, and finally finds himself framed for her murder by corporate enemies.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />A big part of Connelly's appeal involve the police procedurals and the character of Harry Bosch, two key elements that are missing from this novel. It flows fairly well, but the setup turns out to have been predicated on an unlikely ability to predict the main character's actions, and I wasn't buying. The pacing was good, and it was kind of neat to see a rich character apply his resources to the type of problem that Bosch usually faces, but still a weak effort for Connelly.  <br />	2004-10-21

In order to keep control, he must be ruthless in the face of an alliance of treachery that extends into his own household. He tries desperately to find an answer to an impossible problem. <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />From Herbert, I've come to expect an almost fanatical obsession with language and culture that paints a detailed, but not always interesting, portrait. There's something so haughty about so many of the characters that eventually, the grand moments and dramatic speeches lose their power for their frequency. Some of the characters remain interesting, in particular the warrior-turned-mentat Duncan Idaho, who has been reanimated for the purpose of destroying Paul. But there's something limiting about a character who has prescience and has already learned that there is no favorable outcome to his solutions. Paul seems helpless in the face of the enormous forces that surround him, even though his will can be carried out. But the absolute power makes too much seem pointless-when there are tens of millions dying by your every word and command, the human stories lose their power, and the masses seem overwhelming.  <br />However, Dune remains an engaging planet, and the \\"old guard vs. new bureaucrats\\" is always an interesting battle. As before, I found myself wading through a lot of boredom, but captivated by the occasional scene or image. <br />	2004-10-21

Jilly's life intersects with the two brothers when the three are injected by the proverbial mad scientist with a mysterious fluid that soon has the threesome experiencing superhuman powers, even as they are hunted by a cadre of trained killers intent on keeping the mad scientist's inventions from the world. By the end of the book, the three have evolved into something more than human, and they seek to use their gifts to improve the world.    I wanted to give Koontz every benefit of the doubt on this book, having just come off of the spectacular (by Koontz standards) Odd Thomas. What I found is that this book straddles neatly the improvements found in Odd Thomas and the pitfalls that have plagued his writing since the eighties. There is humor to be found throughout the book, particularly in the use of exaggerated and thickly strewn metaphors. Some of it works, and some of it doesn't. I didn't really mind it once the book got going, but what I couldn't forgive as easily were the characters, which were only different from the cardboard cutouts that have peopled his earlier works in details and professions. Dylan and Jilly are philosophical opposites who are attracted to each other. Yet, they're both seemingly incapable of moral uncertainty, and not just because they are compelled to do the right thing. Dylan is a model older brother, caring for the too-adorably autistic Shep with no thought to his own needs.     Another big criticism concerns the verbal sparring between Dylan and Jilly, which is so contrived that it wouldn't seem out of place on an old-time radio show. For example, as men with guns are bearing down on them, Jilly trades barbs with Dylan as he tries to convince her that he is not a serial killer (there is no reason for her to believe that he is one).        I also can't help seeing a similarity between Koontz's books and the films of M. Night Shyamalan. Odd Thomas is about a man who says, in a joking reference to the movie Sixth Sense \\"I see dead people.\\" In this book, Dylan can see the crimes of people with whom he has physical contact, exactly like Bruce Willis's character in Unbreakable. And he has another book from this time period that deals with a large-scale alien invasion, ala \\"Signs.\\"       Despite these criticisms, the book takes a fun idea and moves us fluidly from one action scene to another. The pacing is very well done, and it was certainly a page turner. I plan to still give more of the recent Koontz a try.	2004-10-21

Bloom is undoubtedly taking a certain liberty with the facts, as he strikes a rich vein of fantasy that is reminiscent of, but not borrowed from, a combination of fairy tales and American folklore. His tales of childhood are interspersed with \\"the present,\\" in which his son, who wants a father who can be more honest with him, relates the sad details of his death, in different ways.  <br />Writing: <br />Very well-written, managing to walk the tightrope between classic and entertaining without needing a net. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry. The slimness of the book allows for a reading in one sitting, which lets you really become absorbed. The movie was also terrific, but the book takes the prize, I think.  <br />What I learned:  <br />Maintaining a relationship with your family members is important. Dreaming big and refusing to accept the reality of your surroundings can have both good and bad consequences.  <br />	2004-10-20

The book seeks to provide us with a practical guide for living with germs in a way that reduces the risks of incurring harm. He opens with a general discussion of what constitutes a germ, and catalogues some of the more notorious types and species. He then devotes a chapter each to the germs in a different area of our lives: in the kitchen, in the bathroom, in laundry, in children and child feces, in sexual acts (mostly STDs), in pets, flu and cold germs, in drinking water, in the outdoors, in public areas, and finally, a discussion of what products are beneficial in dealing with germs.   <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />     I was really looking forward to this book, but found it to be a disappointment.  <br />     The back cover promises that the book is \\"often delightfully funny,\\" but I didn't really get that at all. It is less dry than, for example, a research paper on the same topic, but it falls far short of similar books about interesting facets of life (the book \\"Cod\\" comes to mind). The writing was far too bogged down in technical terms, and the author was far more focused on comprehensiveness than he should have been. The witticisms were just too few and far between to bridge the gaps. <br />     I think a better approach, when given this topic, would be to gather together all of the interesting facts, myths, anecdotes, historical anomalies, etc., and tried to find an organization system that would best present them all. But this author has instead taken all of the information that's out there, irrespective of the likelihood that it would be of interest to the general reader, and given each microbe its due. There is an effort to include interesting anecdotes, the large majority of which involve some sort of outbreak of sickness in one part of the country or other, but they fall short of the ideal. The author seemsto be primarily a public health expert, and secondarily an author (although he has written ten books).  <br />     This extends to the handful of illustrations in the book (tellingly labeled \\"Figures\\" as in a scientific paper), which are chosen by some criteria that I don't understand or appreciate, the least helpful of which might be the fuzzy picture of a Carnation Festival in Alliance, Ohio which took place months after a meningitis scare in the area had died down. I certainly hope that Bakalar had a personal reason (such as knowing the \\"carnation queen\\") for including the picture, because there was no value added for the reader.  <br />     What did he do right? Well, he's done a very good job at lightening the text, given that he prioritized comprehensiveness. But his real achievement is in giving good, practical advice that walks the balance between OCD behavior and complete sloppiness. Further, he presents a range of acceptable germ-prevention behavior, and invites us to find our own comfort level.  <br />What I learned: <br />Lots of information in this book. My take, after reading the book,  is that being extremely vigilant against germs will reduce my chances of contracting a serious illness from something like one in a hundred thousand to one in five hundred thousand (my numbers based on an impression, not remotely scientifically accurate). When it comes to mild illnesses, such as colds and diarrhea-inducing stomach ailments, a slob might be in for five such episodes per year, while a very germ-vigilant person might be in for one episode per year. So, if the added security and freedom from illness are important to you, invest the time and energy needed to stay away from potentially harmful germs. But if you're willing to take your chances, don't worry about it.  <br />     One interesting side note was the misleading claims of cleaning products that have antibacterial agents in them. He cites several studies that show that there is no benefit to using them, and a few others that imply that they might actually cause some harm. So when it comes to antibacterial or anti-microbial products, avoid them. This was one of the best chapters in the book, and I wish it had come a little earlier. <br />	2004-10-20

Herbert has found the perfect bridge between the two main camps of sci-fi fandom. For the purists, there is a well-detailed culture, realistic scientific advances, and a glimpse of a far future on a distant planet. For the pulp fan, there are giant sand worms that can swallow a spaceship whole, frequent action scenes, and heroes and villains to watch. <br />   Dune takes place mostly on the desert planet Arrakis, which is important because the giant sand-worms of the desert produce a valuable spice, that is worth a fortune. Arrakis has been under the control of an one of the \\"great Houses,\\" ruled by Baron Harkonnen. But it is about to come under the control of the heroic House Atreides, ruled by Duke Leto Atreides.  <br />   The two houses comprise one side of the interstellar triangle of power that is formed by the Great Houses, the Emperor, and the Guild. House Harkonnen and House Atreides are feuding families, and both sides know that Baron Harkonnen will commit treachery during the transition. The treachery leaves House Atreides in ruins, and Duke Leto's son, Paul, who is the hero of the book, flees into the desert while the planet reverts back to Harkonnen rule. Over the following years, Paul grows in power as he assumes the role of religious leader of the desert people, the Fremen, who are coveted by the powers that be for their superior fighting abilities. Paul is a uniquely powerful individual, blessed with mental superpowers that are both difficult and unnecessary to relate. <br />   The end of the book features a conflict between the Fremen, led by Paul, and the Harkonnens and their intergalactic allies. Needless to say, the villains are vanquished, leaving a fresh hope for the Fremen, whose secret dream is to convert the planet from a land of sand into a more temperate world that will allow them to enjoy life. <br />   Herbert has painted an epic world, fully detailed, which incorporates the elements of many different mythos. Mysticism and technology coexist without overpowering the human conflicts and politics. Codes of conduct are reminiscent of knights from the Middle Ages, giving the interactions a flavor that bears the excitement of tales of that time. Herbert does a good job of balancing action and character development; he shows us a neverending story, and tells us just a piece of the ongoing tale. Dune is the first of five books written by the original author; his son has written three prequels, and there are probably countless spinoffs, as is the case with the Weiss/Hickman Dragonlance chronicles, and Star Wars. <br />   I also liked Dune because of the ecological message; the Fremen sacrifice their immediate comforts for the chance to be environmentally responsible in a good way, and it's interesting that this is an integral plot point.  <br />   Dune asks for effort from its readers; the first fifteen pages were so much gibberish to me as I tried to begin to assimilate the names and terms that were specific to the world of the book. A criticism would be that there was too much of that kind of thing; but I guess that that's the flip side of the coin if you want to present a richly textured world. <br />	2004-10-20
483983:US	20422170	R1IDO3YIYEVA07	0393319407	797409052	The Diversity of Life (Questions of Science)	Books	4	6	8	N	N	The authority on this topic breaks it down for all of us	This book took me a long time to get through (probably about a week), because, while the language is user-friendly, there's so much information contained therein that at times it gets overwhelming. The book covers the history of life on earth in broad strokes, from the time of the first replicating organism through the present, and beyond.  <br />   More than anything, Wilson asks us to appreciate what goes into evolution, and what we stand to lose if we continue destroying our fellow species at anything near the present rate. He also provides a blueprint for an ideal solution to the current global crisis. <br />   One of my favorite sections is chapter 2, which recounts the story of Krakatau, a volcanic island that was blown from existence in the late 1800s. Biologists were able to visit the diminished rock that remained, and watch the reassembly of life on a less-than-desert island. The recounting of the violence of the explosion is gripping, made vivid through an eyewitness account by the captain of a nearby ship, and through the effects of the explosion, which literally traveled around the world in the form of waves. The tidal waves killed 30,000 people, and the sound was the loudest ever recorded in history (as judged by the distance from which people heard it).  Within a year or two, the island began to be a host for life again. Life reached out in several interesting ways, from parachuting arthropods to swimming lizards. You would expect plant life to be the first thing to take hold of the island, but scavengers were able to do their work first, and predators (at the insect level mostly). There were also animals that could eat the things that the sea brought, such as crabs and detritus. Eventually, life rose again, until the island looks very like other islands in the area.  <br />   Wilson also recounts how there were five previous great extinction spasms in the history of species, and how humans are bringing on the most terrible one of all. <br />   In chapters four through ten, Wilson explores the various ways in which species evolve to take advantage of habitat. He gives fascinating examples of symbiotic relationships, adaptive radiation, and the way in which live has slowly and steadily become more diverse over the last billion years. He spoke of certain species with great passion, including ants (which are his primary specialty) and sharks. These both represent extremely successful species, as ants make up more biomass than any other type of creature, and sharks are one of the longest-lived lineages in the world, having evolved to take up hundreds of different oceanic niches.  <br />   Another striking image in the book is the vastness of the worlds in front of us. There are millions of species of bacteria that are completely unknown to us. He estimates the total number of species as ten to 100 million, and stresses that no one can really be more exact than that with any certainty. Of these, we have named only 1.4 million species, and the naming of them is all we have done in the vast majority of these. Meaning, that for the small number of species we have identified, in most cases we have labeled them with a name and sent a specimen to moulder in the drawer of a museum somewhere. We are very ignorant of the world around us. <br />   The rain forests of South America are the lungs of the world, and contain perhaps half of the total number of species on the planet. When he wrote the book 14 years ago, he noted that the rain forest then took up an area the size of the United States, and was losing 2%, or an area the size of Florida, every year, mostly to small-scale agriculture and logging. <br />   In chapters 11 and 12, Wilson talks about the impact that humans are having on the environment, which is, of course, bad. He notes that ancient humans hunted every large flightless animal to the brink of extinction, pointing the finger at paleo-indians for the disappearance of Wooly Mammoths, and at early Polynesian traders for eating their way through hundreds of island bird species (mostly flightless).  <br />   Rather than focus on pollution, Wilson instead talks about physically preserving habitats and environments. There is nothing so threatening to an environment as the clearcutting, burning, or mining of the land itself. Noting that a tenfold decrease in an environment leads to a 50% reduction in the number of species (his own discovery), Wilson makes the plea for preserving large areas of land across the world, especially in 18 global hotspots that represent high areas of diversity that are under fire.  This part of the book gets very depressing, as you get a feel for the thousands of problems, the magnitude of solving even one, and the speed with which the situation is worsening. <br />   Finally, in chapters 13, 14 and 15, Wilson puts the hopeful smile back on our faces as he outlines both what needs to be done, and what has already been successfully done. <br />   He notes that the habitats that are being destroyed are mostly ravaged for economic gain. He then makes the argument that, in many cases, the preservation of the land can be more economically beneficial than the razing of it. For example, clearcutting a single hectare of rain forest yield about 1,000 in profit. But, harvesting the commercially viable fruits and other natural resources from the same spot of land yields 422 in profit-every year. He also notes that the pharmaceutical and food industries have much to gain from prospecting for species that can cure disease or hunger in some way, citing many examples. <br />   For example, rather than raise cows, if ranchers raised turtles for their meat, they would get much more meat per dollar spent, and have a much lower impact on the environment. <br />   In his call to action, Wilson asks that a linnean undertaking be carried out that would seek to name every species in the world. He then proposes that the areas be worked to extract some financial value fromthe species for pharmaceutical companies. Third, he says we should promote sustainable development, by using methods such as strip cutting rather than clear cutting, to take the interest from the land rather than cashing in on the principle. Next, he asks us to save what remains, by essentially recognizing the intrinsic value of the habitats that have no economic value (although, really, every environment has such value in that it provides services to the earth, such as cleaning the air, etc.). Finally, he says we should take steps to restore the environments that we have eliminated. By integrating civilization with the wild, or by reclaiming discarded developed land and making it into a functioning ecosystem, we can actually restore some of the damage we have done. <br />   This was a great book. By laying out the bigger picture, Wilson has shared a vision of the world as it really is, and also given hope by demonstrating that saving the earth is not an \\"owls vs. loggers\\" situation that necessitates taking sides. As many environmentalists know, the needs of the earth and capitalism are not at odds. <br />   The book motivated me to see what has changed in the last 12 years, and get an update on the situation. <br />	2004-10-20

The main character is Dr. Farokh Daruwalla, who was born and raised in India, but lives mostly in Canada. A recurrent theme is Farrokh's feeling of disconnect from both India and Canada; he is frequently described as feeling like he straddles both worlds without fitting in anywhere. One minor criticism is that we should have seen more of the doctor's life in Canada-probably 90% of the book takes place in India.        This is a minor complaint, and the book was really extremely well-written, even by Irving's high standard. With two hundred pages to go, a main plot thread involving the apprehension of a serial killer is wrapped up.  At first, I was wondering how on earth he could keep my interest for 200 more pages, and I worried about the foundering that I experienced in \\"The Fourth Hand.\\" But I shouldn't have worried. The last section of the book flew by, and I was even left wanting more in some respects.       Another small criticism is that there are simply too many perfectly mechanized plot turns, mostly based on the seemingly supernatural ability of the various characters to figure out things that seem objectively impossible to discern.        The various characters leap from the page, including a transvestite cold-blooded killer, a dildo-wielding hippie, her straight arrow police detective husband, a man who is hated in India for his offensive recurring portrayal of \\"Inspector Dhar\\" in the movies, a snobby steward, and a bodyguard/chauffeur, a dwarf who was formerly employed as a circus clown.	2004-10-20

And you know what? It was depressing. But it was also good.<br /><br />  It traces the life of a Chinese farmer named Wang Lung from the day of his wedding to a faithful slave named Olan until his last days on earth. In the beginning of the book, Wang Lung is a hard working farmer, but poor and subject to the hardships that complete dependence on the land brings. His wife O-lan brings about a small measure of prosperity, as she joins him as a partner in the prospect of improving their finances through hard work. They are even able to buy a new piece of land from the great House of Hwang, where Olan lived as a slave throughout her maidenhood.<br /><br />  After they have their third child, a drought-induced famine strikes, driving Wang-Lung from the land which he loves and into the city in search of food. O-lan and the children and Wang Lung's father beg in the streets, while Wang Lung works carrying a ricksha. The life they live is hard, and they are barely able to subsist, living in a hut they have built of mats (following the example of the other poor).<br /><br />  War and rioting break out in the city, and Wang Lung is carried into a rich man's house by a throng of looters. By chance, he finds himself alone in a room with a rich man who is terrified for his life, and he extorts a large amount of gold from him before sending him away. At the same time, his wife has found a loose brick behind which is a store of jewels worth a fortune. They return back to the farming land of the north, and use the money to buy more land and sow the seeds of a farming empire.<br /><br />  The second half of the book deals with the troubles that beset Wang Lung as a rich man, and these are less compelling than his battles against starvation.<br /><br />  The book held my interest, and is most useful as a look into the social strata that made up China in the early 1900s. Themes that run throughout the book are the mistreatment of women without thought, the differences that money makes in social standing, and the corrupting influence of a life of ease.ughout the book are the mistreatment of women without thought, the differences that money makes in social standing, and the corrupting influence of a life of ease.	2004-10-20

This might have been a good story, if the writing wasn't so bad in so many respects. Author Archer served as the youngest member of the House of Commons in England, and no doubt he got his start in writing through this position, rather than by his merits.  <br />   The book is an epic story covering the lives of two powerful men from the day in 1906 that they're both born on separate continents, up until they die in the 1960s. Their lives are parallel in some ways; in other ways, they are a study in contrast. William Kane is born into a life of luxury and power, the only son of one of the most powerful banking families in Boston's elite upper society. Wladek Kosciekicz, who later in life changes his name to Abel Rosnovski, starts his life as a foster son to a poor trapper's family in Poland.  <br />   Kane goes to Harvard and impresses everyone with his bearing and financial wiles at a young age. Abel discovers he is the son of a Baron, but the Baron dies and Abel is sent to a Russian prison camp after the Baron's castle is invaded by Germans.  <br />   Eventually, Kane works his way in as chair of a large banking firm, due in part to his father's name, but mostly because of his own hard work. Abel escapes the labor camp, makes his way to America, and works his way up from a job as a waiter to the owner of a large chain of hotels. <br />   In the course of a financial dealing between the two, Abel grows to hate Kane, and starts a bitter feud that lasts the rest of their lives. <br />   This could be an interesting book, and in some ways it is interesting. The rough young life of Abel is a fascinating story, as is the story of how Kane grows into his family inheritance. A rags to riches story set alongside a riches to more riches story is a good idea, and the backdrop of an emerging America and two World Wars is engaging. <br />   But the book is rife with problems. <br />   First, the poor editing of the book resulted in a rather high number of typos, ranging from wrong-word misspellings to the unintentional repetition of a phrase. This is a minor concern, but when the rest of the book is so shabby, the effect is magnified. <br />   More important is the writing itself, which is filled with on-purposes, rather than mistakes, and that makes them all the worse.  <br />   The tone of the book is generally dreadful, and seems to be infected with the some of the same problems as the books of the day-I wonder if Archer, in researching this book, read so much early 20th century literature that his prose picked up the stiffness of a Sherlock Holmes story.  <br />   Certainly, he does far more telling than showing, and he does this in the worst way possible. There are so many instances in which dialogue is summed up rather than presented, in which grief and other emotions are spoken of rather than exemplified, and in which character dynamics are mentioned rather than displayed, that at some points the book reads like the bible. <br />   Another problem is the pacing. The book moves through the years with a strange rhythm, sometimes dwelling on the most mundane of months for no apparent reason, and then whipping through Kane's experiences as a soldier on the front of World War 2.  <br />   The biggest problem, however, is the overall lack of theme. Archer presents striking parallels between the two men, describing some of their experiences with the very same language. The book is filled with the most bizarre coincidences, as Kane and Abel encounter each other, through random coincidence, three times without either knowing it. Then, their children meet each other and fall in love without knowing each other's identities. It's absurd. But, we can live with these types of coincidences if they serve a greater purpose, and that it the problem. In Irving's \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany,\\" all of the strange coincidences are presented as the will of God. But here, God is barely mentioned, and there is no strong feeling that fate has brought thesetwo men together for some strange purpose. There is no purpose to their meeting at all. Their hatred for each other is spawned through a misunderstanding on Abel's part, and his obsessive determination to take revenge on Kane is cartoonish and out of character. Again, we could understand if there were some reason the two men are drawn to each other, but Archer has given us nothing of that sort to go on. <br />   The stilted writing wrings no emotion from the hearts of its readers, neither joy nor sorrow. When young Kane sees his best friend killed and his sister raped by soldiers, there is no sense of immediacy or grief.  They say that the British have the best-developed sense of humor in the world, but all of the jokes fall flat (such as repeated \\"isn't-he-cute\\" descriptions of young William's precocious childhood. <br />   Then there are the little things that just don't make sense. The aforementioned raping results in the victim dying, apparently raped to death without any explanation. A young Kane has been receiving tutoring lessons for months from his father the Baron, but never notices that the Baron has gone blind. A woman meets Kane on the train; he is a fugitive and has been told to tell no one his name. The dialogue is presented word for word, and then she uses his name. How did she know it? I thought it was an insidious plot point, but it turned out to be a dumb oversight.  <br />  I have begun to think that it is only a recent phenomenon that readers demand realism from their depiction of professions and realistic situations. This book would undoubtedly fall beneath that standard, as the details of the jobs that Kane and Abel occupy are shown in crude outlines.  <br />   Kane is a supposed genius at mathematics, winning the only Harvard scholarship offered in the subject, but then puts this knowledge to no apparent use. It is as if Archer thinks that the theoretical and highly involved mathematics involved with advanced Harvard studies are the most natural academic pursuit for a banker. That's ridiculous. It would be interesting to hear how he applies this knowledge in interesting ways to the practical matters of making finance decisions, but we never get that sense at all.  <br />   Meanwhile, in an astoundingly unrealistic scene, Abel makes a journey as a middle-aged man back to Poland, and discovers that his foster mother is still living a miserable existence in the shack in which he grew up. She appears at first to be senile, and doesn't understand that Abel is her foster son from so long ago. He tries to convince her for all of thirty seconds, and then resignedly hands her some money from his pocket and leaves (the omniscient reader sees her use the money for paper to start her fire).  <br />   My list of complaints goes on and on, but I will close with the ending of the book. After both men have become estranged from their children due to a marriage between them, they each plan a reunion centered on the fact that Abel's daughter and Kane's son are coming to the east coast. Kane dies moments before they arrive at his house. Abel has a successful reunion, and learns that Kane was actually his benefactor before dying himself. It all seems so purposeless, and the book ends with a grand unveiling of the name of the grandson of the two enemies, William Abel Kane.  <br />   Who cares?  <br />    <br />* Note: After perusing the reviews on Amazon.com, I was  surprised to find that Archer is still a successful author, and even more surprised to find that Kane and Abel received rave reviews from the other readers. <br />	2004-10-20

Irving's characters are always part of a world that is different, and simpler, than the world we see around us. Due to growing up in isolation, they develop in different ways. Yet, they seem realistic, because their oddness is a natural reaction to the unusual living circumstances.        In the Hotel New Hampshire, which I would place third on my list of Irving (behind A Prayer for Owen Meany and The Cider House Rules), the narrator chronicles the story of his family. The parents met at a hotel called Arbuthnot by the Sea, and there are five children: Frank, Franny, Jon (the narrator), Lily, and Egg (from oldest to youngest). The family is nourished by the dreams of the father, balanced with the abilities and genius of the various family members.        As with all his books, Irving tells us the whole story, beginning with the parents of Father and Mother, and continuing until the youngest children are in their forties. The children are kind of like the ones in \\"The Royal Tennenbaums,\\" and the book actually shares a lot of themes with the popular movie.        Things they have in common:  --Both involve an incestuous relationship between an athletic brother and his beautiful sister; in both cases, the brother is the initiator  --Both involve a misfit family of brilliant children who turn to each other for understanding  --In Tennenbaums, the children become a Tennis player, a businessman, and a writer. In Hotel, the children become a weightlifter, a businessman (agent), and a writer.  --Both involve a father who is selfish, and who lives for an extended period of time in a hotel.  --Both involve one of the grown children attempting suicide.       Interesting.        Irving employs other trademark devices, including referencing classic literature (in this case, the Great Gatsby and Moby Dick). There are also odd sexual experiences, some of which are involving a group of whores who live in the Second Hotel New Hampshire in Austria.       One thing that bothered me was that one character spends a good deal of time dressed in a bear suit, and there are many instances of people mistaking her for an actual bear. This seems impossible to me.       For all the strong images in the book, the two that lingered in my mind between the two readings (which must have been a period of several years) were the image of Earl, a bear who earned a living for his trainer Freud, and the consummation of incestuous love between two of the main characters.	2004-10-20

She has wisely chosen to emphasize her relationship with her family and their poker lives, probably a prerequisite in order to get the book published. The reader is taken into the Lederer family home on an east coast campus, beginning with a focus on the mother's alcoholism.  Then, Katy recounts her experiences in high school and college, before moving on to Las Vegas, where Howard has made himself wealthy by betting on sports and cards. Finally, Katy returns to the East Coast, and we are left with a feeling of a work in progress- Katy's life story has no climax or summation; she and her family are still in the throes of the issues raised by their unusual choice of occupation. <br />   In general, I liked the book, because it showed the inner workings of a family that is at once familiar and strange. Their various prodigious talents and expressions of genius reminded me of two other genius families I mentioned just a short while ago: the Royal Tennenbaums and the family in The Hotel New Hampshire, right down to the physically frail and emotionally unstable youngest daughter becoming published by writing her memoirs. <br />   The father of the family, Richard Lederer, is also known to me as the author of a series of books related to puns and various commonly made mistakes in the English language. Katy is obviously a serious literary talent, who has grown up around words being used as playthings. Howard, in addition to being a poker genius, is also a chess master. And their mother, who has an amazing rote memorization that helps her as an aspiring actress, has a special talent for puzzles.  <br />   Howard in particular is pulled into the seamier side of poker, getting sucked into a gritty lifestyle involving drugs and cat pee in New York City. But the family seems to have made good financially, even though Howard seemed to be in the midst of a police crackdown on his sports betting business as the book wraps up.  <br />   What struck me also about the book is how very embarrassing it must be to the members of the family. Howard, continually referred to as overweight, is found facedown in the midst of a drug-induced slumber. The mother is weeping all morning to herself, unaware that her daughter is watching her, and even more unaware that her daughter will eventually write about the episode for the book-buying public. I felt a little uncomfortable to be reading these things, knowing that the subjects are out there, probably not feeling all that great about the exposure. <br />   By contrast, Katy is self-indulgent with her own portrayal, and potentially important but embarrassing episodes in her life, such as a break-up with a live-in boyfriend, are glossed over. Overall, we get a portrayal of a girl who is emotionally fragile, prone to depression and indulging that depression, who writes poetry and moons about in the background of happier goings-on because they are not appealing to her well-developed sense of being. <br />   If you can ignore that, however, she does make interesting comments about how wealth has affected her family, and about the implications that Las Vegas's existence has on the human psyche. Money isn't happiness, she says, which is certainly a well-worn clich, but which is never too tired a theme to be shown through interesting example, which is what Katy has done. <br />   I guess, when I think about it, there is some self-criticism on Katy's part. She records her compulsive grade-grubbing, characterizing it as petty, and also talks about becoming a hypochondriac, but there's also a sense that these problems aren't her fault, and that they're special problems for a special person. <br />   In the end, Katy's self-reflections and thoughts are far less compelling than the legitimately sordid and interesting tales of her other family members, and it is the portrayals of other members of the family that will stick with me into the future.  <br />   Katy is a good writer, although she is a little wordy for my tastes (she manages to use the word esplanade twice, for example). She has told the only interesting story from her personal experiences, and she probably could have told the truly interesting bits in about half the space. But I would like to read something written by her on another topic. She writes at one point that she has extensive notes and writing efforts surrounding her own stint as an aspiring poker player. This could be compelling reading, and I'd like to see more from her about topics other than herself. <br />Added: I saw Howard Lederer playing poker online at Ultimatebet.com, and I asked him whether Katy's book had made him unhappy in any way, what with all the revelations. He said no, not at all, and that he supported her 100%. <br />	2004-10-20

But that might not be a bad thing; for many writers, their masterpieces come early (when they still have something to say), and their less notable works come late in life, when the world is most receptive.  <br />   I'd generally put Stephen King in this category, but the jury is still out on Irving. A Widow For One Year bears all the hallmarks of classic Irving-quirky characters, riveting and humorous episodes, development of a \\"theme,\\" and nods to literary giants who have come before. <br />   In this case, the characters are, mainly, the family of Ted Cole, a philandering children's author who is more concerned with keeping his daughter than his wife. His wife, Marion, who is described as one of the most beautiful women on the planet, is grief-stricken by the death of their two sons, Timothy and Thomas. Their daughter, Ruth, conceived after the tragedy in an effort to make a new start, starts the novel as a four year old, but spends most of the book as a rather tough female novelist. The other main characters are Eddie, also a novelist, whose love affair with Mrs. Cole at the age of sixteen leads him to a lifelong interest in dramatically older women; and Hannah, a friend of Ruth's who is mainly described through her promiscuity.  <br />   The plot is difficult to convey, because the most traditionally sensational events of the book, involving a murder in the red light district of Amersterdam, are secondary to the character development, and indeed seem more like a device to introduce Ruth to a future lover. <br />   Irving is at his most entertaining when he is describing calamitous events befalling innocent people, and we get this in spades when Eddie, acting as chauffeur to Ted, and the gardener of a Mrs. Vaughn, get caught up in the violent fallout of a love affair between Mrs. Vaughn and Ted.  <br />   The theme is distracting, because there is a tremendous amount of focus on the degree to which a fictional novel is taken from the lives of the author. Ted, Ruth, Eddie, and Marion are all writers; they all draw from their lives to a different degree, and write for different reasons. I get the feeling that Irving is conveying his own views on the subject, but they are so intensely involved that they become boring. The average reader is not so interested in the real-life inspiration for characters and plot devices that he or she would like to read hundreds of pages inundated with that theme, I think. I didn't really care about whether Ruth used incidents from her real life or not, and I also was reading under the impression that Irving was using this as an opportunity to give voice to his own pet peeves with regard to book tours. Ruth hates signing autographs; does Irving? She tires of certain fan questions (where do you get your ideas?)' is this Irving telling us directly? Maybe the issue isn't even so much boring as distracting; I found it impossible to read about Ruth being irritated with an interviewer for not having read the book (for instance) without wondering if this is a John Irving experience. And this is because, at the same time, Ruth and the others debate how much of their real-life experience comes out in their writing.  Overall, I thought that this was not in full service to the reader's interests, and may have even crossed into the realm of self-indulgence. <br />   And so, this interfered with the book becoming a slam-dunk; in my mind, this and a slightly less-likable cast of characters keep Widow from overtaking the other favorites of mine in the Irving canon. <br />   For the record, here is my ranking to date: <br />First, A Prayer for Owen Meany, which also ranks on my list of best books ever read <br />Second, The Cider House Rules <br />Third and Fourth, a toss-up between The Hotel New Hampshire and The World According to Garp, which is tough becauseI've read Hotel twice, and more recently, while Garp was my first Irving novel and is fuzzy in my mind. <br />Fifth, A Widow for One Year, which is still an excellent book <br />Sixth, The Fourth Hand, which was the least enjoyable so far of the Irving books I've finished <br />	2004-10-20

The book tracks the backstories of the animal's trainer, owner, and jockey, follows them as they combine with Seabiscuit to shake the racing world, and then follows each of them as they dodder off into obscurity. Author Hillenbrandt takes care to place every event in its context, with the most important theme being that of a group of men and a horse who come from lowly beginnings to triumph over the wealthy establishment on behalf of the poor working or want-to-be-working class everywhere. <br />Writing: Hillenbrandt does a terrific job, giving us as many descriptive scenes as possible. Her narrative prose is richly descriptive without sounding too snooty, and she always seems to find the most interesting detail in what must have been a truly mountainous pile of material. While there were some parts that I found slow or boring, I suspect that they were included because their omission would have resulted in an incomplete story; if certain things don't happen, such as the narrative climax and happy endings that I want, I can only blame history. <br />What I learned: <br />The lives of horse jockey's were amazingly tough, as they went to all sorts of outrageous lengths to lose weight in order to remain legally viable to race. Their devil-may-care culture reminded me of the culture of newsboys during the same time period described in a book I read about Christmas. The fact that racing horses are weighted down with weights in order to even out their chances was a surprise to me; the decision of how much weight is made by a panel of subjective people, and the politics that accompanied this were interesting (and stomach-turning, in some cases).  <br /> <br />	2004-10-17

His insertion of self into the story of the woods is distracting, except for when he relates his actual activities impacting the forest. To clarify: I want to hear how he makes his forest an economically beneficial entity by planting and culling trees, but I don't want to hear about a moonlit trek through the forest on snowshoes for the sole purpose of stringing together a bunch of pretty adjectives on the off chance that he will engender compliments as to his literary talents.  <br />What I learned:  <br />A lot about trees, of course. One thing that was of particular interest was the way that trees grow to cope with their immediate environs. For example, a tree will point its branches upward so that ice won't form near the tips, and thereby rip the branch from the tree through sheer weight. The tree doesn't do this on purpose, of course, but any poorly-designed branches are ripped out over time, so you wind up with a tree perfectly suited for its particular locale. Another interesting bit of news was the way that trees develop a symbiotic relationship with certain species of insects, such as ants. The ants can eat a minimal amount of foliage without really hurting the tree, and the tree in turn is guarded by the ants from other, more harmful browsers. <br />	2004-10-17

A handful of characters, led by straight-laced Ray Steel and famous journalist Buck Williams, are among the millions who are left behind when all of those who have chosen God as savior disappear, presumably to go to heaven. Without global consensus on what happened to the millions who have mysteriously vanished, each character is left to make up his or her own mind about whether it was a religious event, and whether to accept God as savior. A magically capable politician rises from obscurity in Romania, and is soon identified by the born-again Christians as the Antichrist, wrapping up the first act.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />     I didn't know that this was a religious book when I picked it up. I got it because the subject matter seemed similar to other books I've found interesting lately (ironically, mostly science fiction) dealing with worldwide phenomena that change the course of human history. Also, I've noticed books by these authors hitting the bestseller list, so I knew they were popular. I thought it was odd that one of the testimonials on the cover asserted that this book would change my life, but I thought it was just an overzealous sales pitch. About fifty pages in, the book starts to hone in on the spiritual conversion of a man whose wife and son have gone to heaven, and I read the back cover more closely to discover the book's agenda (or at least the religious background of the two authors).  <br />     The book got increasingly preachy over the next three hundred pages, and plenty of time is given to each person's theological questions.  <br />     Despite the religion, to which I'm personally opposed, I did enjoy certain elements of the book. The beginning is pretty gripping, as the disappearance is unveiled and the initial reactions take place. Also, the authors have a real ear for dialogue, and the spoken interactions between the characters are very often simultaneously nuanced and clear, nto an easy task to pull off.  <br />     However, the book was clearly published on the expectation that Christians would buy it because of the religious gimmick, rather than on its merits as a novel. The characters are all initially interesting, but slowly become more and more cartoonish, in large part because the research to flesh out the details of their personal and professional lives hasn't been done. Don't write about a pilot and a journalist if you're not going to throw out some information about how their jobs work. The negligence is more glaring on the airplane side of things than on the journalism side, but it's universal. This manifests itself again when an overly-simplistic view of international politics strains credibility time and again, until at some point, nothing seems remotely believable. For me, this was when the Antichrist, posing as a humble but amazingly capable leader, refuses the leadership of the UN publicly because they aren't in line with certain noble goals (such as agreeing to eliminate all weaponry of the member countries), and the UN rushes to meet those demands in a matter of days. This is just so completely impossible that I couldn't overlook it. And presentation of certain of the facts is likewise sketchy, as when a police officer ruefully notes that in the suburbs, home burglary is up \\"200% in the last two weeks alone.\\" That statistic just doesn't make any sense, if you think about it, and I can't imagine the set of numbers that would fulfill that measurement. This is just sloppy writing. <br />     Further, we are supposed to believe that, in a world in which big, obvious miracles are happening, the large majority of the world doesn't recognize this and is still generally unsupportive of religion. In my mind, if an army was invading Israel by air and suddenly spontaneously combusted, or if every devout Christian in the world suddenly disappeared, the theological effect would be enormous. I'm a scientific person; this means that I go by the evidence. If God manifested himself in that way, you better believe I'd be drawing spiritual conclusions from that evidence, and I don't think that the rest of the non-saved world would be far behind me.  But in the book, it seems that people are taken aback by the initial catastrophes, and then move on to life as usual in a matter of weeks. To charge that scientists would ignore evidence of God is to mischaracterize science.  <br />     This is a subset of another problem I perceived, which is basically right wing politics permeating the text. Abortion clinic workers who are suddenly jobless are shown as selfish since they aren't overjoyed that there are no abortions to provide. Presidents Bush and Reagan are mentioned and given kudos, while Clinton is replaced by a fictional president. Californians uniformly believe that aliens were responsible for the disappearance, because they're so wacky and new-age liberal, I suppose. Buck, the hero, thinks back to the reasons that he got into journalism-to fight big government, for example. These details and a handful of others just give the book a slant that I wish it didn't have. It would have been just as easy to bash big corporations, or to focus on feeding the poor, as it would have been to bash those targets. To me, that's not religious, that's republican.  <br />     Finally, there is so much focus on theology. Characters wrestle with how best to spread their faith, and about how to accept God the best, and so on. But none of the more interesting theological questions are answered. Did all the other religions see their devout convert to Christianity, after they were left behind? Were there countries where virtually no one disappeared due to Muslim populations, and what was the reaction? What happened to the Catholic chain of command, and who picked up the pieces? Children up to a certain age were taken. What age? Werethere any exceptions? These types of issues are rather glaringly ignored, while too much space is given to the personal religious interactions between the characters.  <br />     One last positive note is that it's kind of cool to see an assembly of \\"super-duper Christian fighters\\" named Tribulation Force ready to battle evil. There's a kind of comic book feel, and later entries in the series will get a lot of mileage out of Christians using a manifest power of god to battle evil.  Neat stuff.  <br />     So, to sum up, you have some really good dialogue in the book, but if you take it out, you're left with interminable theological ponderings mixed with implausible plot points. Still, the book is interesting as a curiosity, and other books in this vein might be able to succeed in some of the weaker areas of this one.  <br />What I learned: Not a whole lot. I guess it did make me think about how awkward it is for some people who feel a need, an urgency, to spread their faith but who aren't accepted for those reasons in certain circles (my own included, with no regrets). Also, the end days as predicted in the bible are pretty bleak.  <br />	2004-10-16

While they couldn't fully replicate a natural wolf setting, they come as close as can be imagined by fencing off several square miles of varied terrain in the Sawtooth Mountains, and living within a small wired-off enclosure within the larger area. The wolves they raise from puppies so that they can interact with them safely, and observe them without interrupting their natural behavior. Over the course of six years, Dutcher describes the wolf behavior he observes in great detail, and he also highlights the more interesting technical aspects and logistical obstacles in filming a wildlife documentary. We get a more general, and less honest, view of his relationship with his wife Jamie, and his relationship with others involved in the project, others with whom he becomes increasingly contentious. There is almost no insight into the financial end of a project like this. <br /> <br />First, the bad. Dutcher falls into the common trap of inserting himself into the story when unnecessary; or, to be more precise, inserting his opinions into the story. On the one hand, the author should be able to express his ideas; he's the author, after all. But on the other hand, he's disparaging a group of colleagues who share responsibility for the wolves, and he's not making enough of an effort to give their side of things fair play, in my opinion. He does articulate their position on wolf welfare in general terms at times, but only to give him a vague idea to refute in detail. Also, every time he mentions his wife, I can practically hear her breathing as she reads over his shoulder. I don't mind that he's talking about his experiences with her as they pertain to the story at hand, but I do object to flights of romantic fancy when describing in detail the first meeting. Let's be honest here, it comes off as bald-faced pandering.  <br /> <br />Dutcher's tendency to defend each action he takes, and his obvious omission of certain things, leads me to speculate on his overall honesty, and to take everything with a grain of salt. It also leads to incomplete storytelling, which has the deleterious side effect of fragmenting the story a bit. This isn't a horrible problem, but it's a real one.  The basic disagreement between Jim and WERC, the organization he founds but which eventually throws him out, seems to be on whether the wolves should be managed by people, or whether they should live largely without human contact.  Some of Jim's management steps are so humanitarian that the \\"natural\\" alternative is just clearly barbaric, and would result in needless suffering. But he muddies his case when he implies that being taken away from the pack results in pack dysfunction, leading ultimately to some of the wolves killing each other as they battle for dominance. It's not fair, in my opinion, to speculate in such a roundabout manner on his ability to make harmony an ongoing element of the pack relations.  <br /> <br />On the good side, Jim includes lots of great information about wolf interactions, some of which seem to be recorded for the first time because of the unique situation. He also articulates in detail real arguments about the use of non-wild footage to supplement the footage of a wildlife documentary. There is some great behind-the-scenes information about camera angles and the like that was pretty interesting. He devotes a chapter to each wolf, which was a smart move, I think, because it gave me such a sense of the broad range of personalities and characteristics that each individual could possess.  <br /> <br />The writing itself was very good; it was clear and generally concise, and very accessible to the reader.  <br /> <br />What I learned: <br />I read once before that wolves aren't necessarily locked into their social hierarchy at all times. One wolf might assume alpha statusduring hunting, and another during feeding, for example. But this book refutes that claim, and shows that an alpha wolf is always very much in charge; even though he might allow another wolf to take a prominent role in an activity, there is always an understanding that the alpha is dominant, and the omega is submissive. Most of the fighting occurs among the mid-ranking wolves, who are not secure in their status and thus must assert themselves violently over the omega and each other frequently. Another interesting fact was that Lakota, the omega male in this pack, was one of the biggest, most physically powerful wolves, hinting that fighting prowess might be less important than personality or other undefined factors in determining status. <br />	2004-10-16

They have human stories that seemed mildly interesting, and that's the best that can be said of them. Hate is particularly good. In all the rest, the sci fi has taken over, apparently eclipsing the need for realistic characters, motivation, or plot. And the sci fi itself generally seems dull, rooted as it is in the decades before computing. Unlike in 2001, the writing is, as a rule, very stilted. A few of the ideas are interesting, but many of them have been done to death (like the idea of a scientist working with insects to conquer the world-yawn).

750350:US	20422170	R3MRYQJV1622YK	0345449347	990748107	The Fourth Hand	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A middling effort by Irving is miles ahead of the pack	Book Review: The Fourth Hand, by John Irving<br />   I borrowed this book from the library with the thought that, since Irving has written three outstanding novels in my collection (Cider House Rules, Owen Meany, and Hotel New Hampshire), I should probably read everything else he's written in case there are other gems in his life's work<BR>   The Fourth Hand is not such a gem, but nearly half the book was a delight to read.<BR>   Irving departs from the formula that has guided other of his works that I've read. In The Fourth Hand, the characters are not insulated from the real world; as a television field reporter with a degree of fame, protagonist Patrick Wallingford is as immersed in the real world as it is possible for a minor celebrity to be. He gains international notoriety when his hand is eaten by lions while covering a story at a circus in India. A significant time after the accident, Patrick receives a hand transplant. The widow of the donor, Doris Clausen, demands visitation rights with the hand, which is, after all, a still-living part of her husband. Patrick falls in love with Doris, perhaps because, on first meeting him hours before the transplant, she has sex with him in order to conceive the child that she and Otto never could.<BR>   The doctor who performs the transplant, Dr. Zajac, is an extremely interesting character who tries to develop a relationship with his son despite the best efforts of his ex-wife. Zajac's frumpy housekeeper is so moved by the doctor's feelings for his son that she falls in love with him, and transforms herself into a sexpot in order to gain his affection. <BR>   The second half of the novel tracks Patrick's efforts to develop a relationship with Doris after his body has rejected her late husband's hand. At the same time, Patrick's dalliances with women and the office politics of his television anchor job become entangled in these efforts and each other. <BR>   Most of Irving's novels track their protagonist from beginningto end; they are sprawling, and let you know how everything turns out. In this book, we get a section out of the middle of Patrick's life, and I was left wondering about the ending, and not in a good way. I would have preferred to see what contributed to the curiosities of Patrick's character; he is an affable man without any sense of \\"deepness,\\" but we don't know why. The book tracks his development into someone with values and integrity, but there is something missing.<BR>   Despite these complaints, The Fourth Hand is an interesting read, and some of the scenes are absolutely delightful. As always, Irving finds a way to incorporate text from other authors; in this case, EB White's children's tales Stuart Little and Charlotte's Web share time with The English Patient. And the intricacy of certain of the characters should serve as a model for novelists everywhere. Dr. Zajac, who is unhealthily thin, a bird watcher, a former lacrosse player, a brilliant hand surgeon, a miserable observer of human nature, a struggling father, and more, is the prime example of how to make a character interesting and engaging. <BR>   Irving has tinkered with the formula that has made his writing such a unique joy; the deviations are, on balance, more negative than positive, but I hope that the experience will help him to produce more masterpieces.	2004-03-11
