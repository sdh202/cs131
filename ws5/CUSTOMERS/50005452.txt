This particular poem is about the love between an American soldier and his bride-to-be in the Revolutionary era of the 1770's.  It is a graphic and sad tale of the sacrifices that people will make for true love.  The central theme of the story is the British soldiers taking hostage the love of the \\"Highwayman.\\" The soldiers use her as bait to draw him out so that he could be murdered.  Instead of submitting herself to this mission, though, she gives up her life by shooting herself with a gun, just in time to warn her love of the danger that he was being drawn to.  The rest of the story deals with the decision between protecting the life that his love sacrificed for and honoring the life of the lover that he has lost. <br />   <br /> The illustrations utilize dark colors, shadows, and details (and lack thereof) to bring the mood of the poem to life.  The words themselves also do a great job of creating the atmosphere of a tragic love affair that is destined for an unhappy ending.    <br />  <br /> While this book is a \\"picture\\" book, the themes of death, suicide, and murder prove too much for a younger audience.  This poem is typically one that it is read by High School and College students, not by young readers.  The poem is difficult to understand if just read casually, as it must be considered and pondered about in great detail.  I would recommend it to readers who are mature enough to handle the themes of this	2005-03-03

In the wreck she bumped her head and has forgotten her identity.  She is also unable to speak.  Ben's mother takes her in and plans to nurse the girl back to health.  They nickname her Teetoncey, in reference to her petite size. Everything about her remains a mystery.  Everyone wonders if she comes from a rich family.  They also wonder if there were treasures on the boat when it sank.  At first Ben likes the idea of trying to help the girl.  After awhile he gets tired of her in his room and he wonders if she will ever get well and be able to return to her own home.   <br /> <br />The book introduced a lot of culture and vocabulary from the Outer Banks of North Carolina.  The book also moved at a quick pace. Teetoncey would make a good choice for a middle school student who had to give a book report.  It's a quick and easy read.  The book also included the first chapter from the next book in the series.  Readers will read the first chapter and want to know more leading them back to the library to find Book 2 in the series! <br /> <br /> <br />I would recommed this book to boys and girls ages 10-12.  If the reader enjoys books about adventure, sea life, and boating they will enjoy this book. <br /> <br />	2004-09-22

It has a dark and ominous feel to it as you read.  It left me feeling very unpleasant and disturbed after finishing the book.  The dark colored pictures are very depressing.  The flow of the book is lethargic. <br />This book is a chronicle of depressing tale of a man who has been given a gift of finding water through the use of diving rod, who then mysteriously loses the gift and becomes depressed.  He gives up the things that he loves because he lost his gift.  No one can seem to break him out of his depressed mood, even his granddaughter.  It is kind of a heavy theme for a book that appears to be written for a younger age.  <br />The reader is drawn to the book because of the appearance of a pig on the cover.  It would leave one to believe that the book would be mainly about the pig, but the pig is just a supporting character to the story.  <br />I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless you want to be left feeling low and depressed.  Our children were not very receptive at all.	2003-11-15

The basis of the story is how a big brother picks on and teases his little sibling (in this case a little brother), but is still loved and admired by the sibling.  The interesting part of this story, though, is that the characters in the book are monsters!  No need to be afraid, though, as the monsters are not scary, but actually cute!  The little monsters enjoy the same things that human kids do, but of course, with a monster-like twist! The illustrations are very enjoyable, and it is fun to find the \\"strange\\" items in each drawing.

When you think of manners, usually the last thing that you think about is pigs.  You get a notion in your mind of a pig rolling around in the mud or digging its snout into the slop and making a mess.  I think, though, that the choice of pigs to demonstrate good (and bad!) manners in this book was a perfect choice.  Children, including mine, are naturally drawn to pigs, which I believe is the reason for the popularity of Charlotte's Web and Babe.  Just seeing a picture of pig dressed up as a teacher on the front of the book was enough to take this book off the shelf and put into our library bag.<br /> <br />My family and I really enjoyed that the author looked at both good and bad manners.  The human mind often needs to see a positive and negative connotation to truly grasp an idea.  It also gives the parent an opportunity to discuss why something is considered \\"good manners\\" and what can be improved in the situations where \\"bad manners\\" are exhibited.  The author covers a good deal of the \\"manners\\" that parents try to instill in their children, but in a fun way for the whole family!<br /> <br />To top things off, the illustrations in this book are wonderful!  They tease the imagination to see animals playing human roles.  Also, the emotions of the animals seemed to be expressed through the style and colors of the background and the writing on the pages.  Then, of course, are the subtle things on each page that entice you to spend time carefully looking at each page.  On every page there are small things that are sometimes overlooked at first, but quite enjoyable when found! The use of colored newspaper pieces in the background as everyday objects was ingenious and added so much appeal to the book.  This book is a work of art that is useful in teaching manners!	2003-10-29

As a fan of Amelia's books for 20+ years, I was looking forward to reading this book to my eight-year-old son.  I was disappointed in the book, though, and my son seemed to feel the same way.  When we usually read Amelia books we both end up laughing at her silliness, but this book seemed to force the humor and ended up not being funny at all.  My son did enjoy opening the flaps at first, but after the second one, everything just became too predictable.  It was liking using the same joke over and over and over, and it got tiresome very quickly.  I wish I could recommend this book to someone, but I can't.
