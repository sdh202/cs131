This is the 'case for peace' by the renowned Harvard professor and legal scholar.  Dershowitz gives a double enveloping of the issue, looking not only at how peace can be acheived but also at how western academics and the arab meadia work against peace, so that the very people who call for 'peace and justice' are actually those, like Dr. Sami Al Arian, who are involved in supporting financially and intellectually terrorism and the murder of children.<br /><br />Dershowitz looks at the Barak proposals from 2000 and the 'road map' as the area of peace and argues that the death of Arafat makes peace possible.  The withdrawel from Gaza and the completion of the security fence will leave a final border in place with 95% of the West bank and Gaza under Palestinian control.  A few settlement blocks such as Maalle Adumim and Gush Etsion will be the remaining issues, as well be Jerusalem and the refugees.  Dershowitz argues from some compensaiton but no return for the 'refugees' who today number 9 million(out of an original palestinian population in 1948 of 1.2 million, the greatest growth rate of people in the entire world, most 'refugees' have been 'refugees' longer than their families ever lived in Israel.)  Dershowitz beleives, perhaps incorrectly, that their is a solution and a way to share Jerusalem.<br /><br />The Gaza operation has proven that peace really can only come through Israeli unilateral action, that the Palestinians are not a power that can be negotiated with and that the PA is basically lawless and that Hamas will soon overtake Fatah as the main political party anyway.<br /><br />A small, well argued polemic aimed to some extent at the converted or those who already realize the truth about Israle and simply need some more encouragement in their arguments and debates with anti-Israel haters and terrorist supporters.<br /><br />Seth J.

However the KGBs rivals included other deviant forms of communism, heresies if you will, such as China, Albania and Yugoslavia.  China tried to penetrate Africa in the 1970s, bankrolling revolutions and dictatorships, Cuba was also deeply involved in Angola(to the tune of 30,000 troops) and in Ethiopia.  Russia had a toehold in Vietnam, but China was weary of the Vietnamese attempt to overrun Laos and Cambodia in 1975.  In South America different strains of communism helped lead to the death of Che Guevara.  The war in central America was about Communism and the KGB infiltrated the governments of the Middle east. Khrushchev was the orginal architect of the turn to the third world, realziing that even reactionary third world dictators could be courted through money to help fight America.  It was the opposite of the Stalin policty of viewing everyone as the enemy who was not proclaiming friendship.<br /><br />This excellent book looks at the KGB's role in africa though newly declassified documents and access to other hitherto unpublished files.  We see many funny apsects of the KGBs role and learn many new things about the extent of the penetration.<br /><br />A fascinating book.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-09-26

Pedro was witness to what is only now coming to light, the rampant racism, hatred of women, sexual harassment, fascism, drug dealing and money wasting that is what the U.N stands for today.  Pedro explains and shows with funny and lively examples the true nature of the U.N, support for terror and genocide and the dictatorship of the worlds dictatorships.  Since the UN is a democracy the fact that the majority of the world's nations suppress human rights, and women and are dictatorships means they can control the UN committees like Human rights, so that those committees never find 'human rights' violations in countries such as Libya or Cuba but magically only find them in the most democratic and free countries.<br /><br />The UN was created to stop genocide, but what was the UNs role in the genocides in Cambodia(1975), Rwanda(1994) and Sudan(1985-today)?  Nothing. In fact as Sanjuan shows the UN did nothing to stop genocide because those with the bloodies hands such as Idi Amin and Arafat are favorites at the UN, heroes to most of its member states.<br /><br />Sanjuan shows how UN employees engage in criminal activities and how the UN supported KGB spying and drug dealing and wasted billions of U.S tax payers money(the US pays for the majority of the Un budget and receives the majority of criticism from the UN).  Sanjuan shows how UN soldiers, which we now know to be true, traded sex for food in Africa.<br /><br />This is a brilliant account of the truth behind the UN and its inner workings and although some stories seem too fantastic to be true, it is nevertheless a wonderful rip roaring account.  Central to Sanjuans view is that anti-Semitism is rampant at the UN including a vicious UN sponsored campaign to smear U.S Jews and U.S Jewish lawmakers, the mere fact that Jews and Judaism would ever be mentioned at the U.N(given that Jews make up .00001% of the world) is ample evidence of anti-Semitism showing that UN workers have an 'elders of Zion complex' regarding Jews.<br /><br />A great book, a great gift for anyone interested in America and current affairs and why the UN doesn't prevent genocide, but supports it.<br /><br />Seth J.

It is a claim of moral relativism that the only people who can report about a culture are those from it. Under this guise a Christian Arab speaker from Oklahoma is sopposed to be better at understanding the subtleties of Iraqi culture, however the culture of Baghdad in 2005 is not the same as the remmembered culture of Lebanese Americans in Oklahoma.  Shias are not Orthodox Christians and we are talking about very different things here.<br />2)  Iraqi 'patriots' and 'martyrs'.  This book accepts the wrong view that a 'martyr' is someone who blows himself up in order to kill as many civilians as possible.  This is a twist, or an islamification, of the word 'martyr'.  Martyr in English means one who loses his life, preferable for the church or for a cause, never by taking a life.  This book and the Iraqi interviewees have perverted this word.  An Iraqi 'patriot' is also not someone who murders Iraqis.  In fact 90% of the suicide bombers in Iraq have been non-Iraqis and this fact is not illuminated, they are not martyrs or patriots, they are invaders who come to murder Shia civilians and Iraqi police.<br /><br />This book appears to be unbiased, as the author doesnt delve into propoganda and doesnt feed the reader his opinion.  He tries to examine the lives of ordinary Iraqis under Saddam, during the war and after as the insurgency grows and america becomes an 'occupier' not a 'liberator'.  What we realyl learn is something about impatience in Human nature, short memories and the muddled lies of history and language and meaning.  Surely Democracy is seen as the first time Iraqis could choose their leadership, hence the plethora of political parties.  However at the same time the anger that America appears to be less efficient at security than Saddam turns people to terrorism.  Sometimes there is a time to judge and perhaps the book would have been better had those who have 'martyrs' as sons been called to account rather then allowed to spread propoganda about how proud they were that their offspring took the lives of others.<br /><br />An interesting book with some accurate first hand information.<br /><br />Seth J.

He writes convincingly that he only met Saddam twice, in 1994 and 2002.  He claims, as he claimed before the Senate, that he med Saddam in order to put an end to sanctions in 1994 and in 2002 in order to get Saddam to let Hans Blix in the country to inspect for the WMDs.  If this is true, it begs the question why he needed to meet with Saddam in order to get sanctions lifted, shouldn't he have met with those who applied the sanctions, like Bill Clinton?  It appears that meeting had more to do with strategizing alongside Saddam, then with ending the sanctions and what he claims was the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children.<br /><br />Now Galloway turns the second section of his book into self aggrandizement surrounding his run in with Christopher Hitchens.  Hitchens, an American leftist intellectual, dared to be original and oppose Islamism and Saddam, and for that he has received the hate of many academics and leftists, including the insult by Mr. Galloway \\"\\"Christopher, your hands are shaking. Go and have another drink...You are a drink-sodden, former Trotskyite popinjay.\\" Is this a statement to be proud of?  Is hate speech, slander and petty accusations something to be proud of? According this book it is and this is just part and parcel to the rest.<br /><br />The last part of the book isn't original material, simply the transcript of Galloway's testimony in which he comes face to face with Minnesota Senator Coleman.  Galloway was accused of being on Saddams payroll by former Saddam regime officials as well as accused of supporting Saddam and being involved in the Oil for food scandal, he was named on a list of 270 people involved with such things.  He was also accused of running a company involved in the scandals.  The oil for food scandal incidentally stole 2 billion from the same Iraqi children Galloway purports to have wanted to help.  At the same time Saddam Hussein used the money to support the families of suicide bombers who murdered civilians, something Galloway never bothers to refute or condemn.<br /><br />In the end for those who hate America and hate the Iraq war this will make a good read, it is preaching to the converted.  For those with an open mind or interested in reading something calm and intellectual without bombasticism, this is not a very good read, rather it is full of anger and disrespect both for America and for intellectuals such as Hitchens.<br /><br />Seth J.

Books	5	32	41	N	N	Speaking the truth	This provocative book speaks the truth and delves into the darkness of honesty about the fate of the world in the years to come.  The author paints a bleak picture of demographic decline in Europe and the rise of Islam worldwide. The book shows conclusively how Islamic fundamentalism puts Europe in the dangerous situation it was in during the 1930s with the difference that today it is a demographic and not a political threat, however conversion to political ideology and religion are much the same thing since Islamism is a political ideology.<br /><br />The Clash of Civilizations was spelled out by Mr. Huntington and Bat Yeor spelled out the truth of Dhimmitude, now all that is left is to understand the true threat, and this book operationalizes that threat, giving examples from history, like paralleling today's western civilization with the native Americans in the 1600s.  He also gives a rundown the Islamic colonization of Europe that began in the 7th century and a short history of the Islamic-western relations.<br /><br />A good controversial book.<br /><br />Seth J.

Herzog was a descendant of a major Rabbinical family, his father was the Chief Rabbi of Ireland and then Israel, a family of Torah scholars immersed in Zionism and progressive for their time, perhaps more progressive than today's orthodox Jews.<br /><br />Yaacov's brother was a commander in the IDF and president of Israel.  Yaacov himself served as a special advisor on minority, mostly Christian Affairs, in Israel, he was a liaison to the Christian community, then an advisor to Ben-Gurion, then initiating secret contacts with King Hussein.  As a Diplomat he went to Africa and other places, cultivating Milton Abote and other 3rd world leaders.  In 1961 he was advisor to Canada and debated noted professor Toynbee when the professor compared Israel in 1948 morally to the Nazis.  In his debate he was seen to have won many points.  Throughout his life he was an erudite, an intellectual, a diplomat, advisor to four prime ministers, a Torah scholar, and an extraordinary human being.<br /><br />This book includes the CD of the Toynbee debate and is wonderfully written, artfully capturing Jewish life from Ireland to Israel and one mans extraordinary touch upon the world.<br /><br />Seth J.

The book purports to try to lift the veil off of Islamism and explain the Jihadists, their motives and origins. The first chapter deals with Culture Talk, which is to say an open dialogue about Islam, the West and Jihad. Here the book tries to show that 'Jihad' as a term was first employed by Muslims who were fighting fellow Muslims, whether it was against the rich slave traders of Africa or the effendis of Saudi, we are told it was not a term aimed at non-muslims.<br /><br />The second portion of the book tries to show how America grafted Jihad onto its goals in the cold war. Typical of the 'America is the greatest terrorist' this book tries to show that terrorism was invented by America to fight the cold war in Africa and central America. Then the book tries to show that, having learned about terrorism while aiding the contras, the CIA created the Jihadist elements in Afghanistan. In the final analysis the book argues that the CIA basically came up with the idea of Jihad and that by extension the CIA basically planned 9/11. Here is where the book fails.<br /><br />Apparently forgotten in these pages are several incidents of genocide against non-muslims by muslims that had nothing to do with the west. No chapter sheds light on the Armenian massacres, the Assyrian genocide or the Hindu/Sikh genocide in Pakistan. And of course no chapter explains the virtual genocide against the Chinese and East Timorese in Indonesia. These incidents of mass slaughter had nothing to do with the cold war, just as the Moro Jihadist insurgency in the Philippines had nothing to do with the cold war. It is true that their was massive funding for the Anti-Russian resistance in Afghanistan, and it is true that radical anti-western elements in the ISI of Pakistan encouraged the creation of Islamism. But this doesn't fit the argument that this book is trying to convey, namely that the West is 100% responsible for 9/11 and Al Queida. The reality is this book wants to blame the victim and to never blame those who are the actual terrorists. Although the book quickly condemns terrorism by S. Africa it never once condemns the same exact terrorism when practiced against the west. Why? Is the argument here that when terrorism is employed by western countries then the west is 'evil' and when terrorism is employed by Jihadists then it is also the west's fault. Hypocrisy is the name of the game in the conclusion. Thus there is a major failure of honesty in this read and many who hate America will be happy with this analysis but someone interested in the roots of Islamism will be left cold. Two facts remain, first the CIA is given far too much credit for being competent, which it is not and Second there is a total ignoring of previous Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Muslim nationalists like Nasser.<br /><br />Lastly the book tries to compare Christian 'fundamentalism' with Islamic 'fundamentalism'. But the problem is their is not one incident where Christian terrorists have gone to an Islamic country and bombed mosques or schools while shouting 'God if Great'. Their is simply nothing to compare, because witht he exception of Ireland their hasn't been any Christian terrorism in the 20th century.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzmannd Al Queida.

In all these accounts it fails miserably.  It is important to examine just a few of the major problems with this polemic.<br /><br />1)  Religion is the opening point of the book, the point being that since Christianity, Judaism, and Islam share some religious ideas that therefore there is hope for peace. First of all this is just plain bunko.  Religion, while on the surface a divider, has little to do with the conflict.  Just as religion is an excuse used by the protagonists in the Ireland-English conflict it is a similar excuse in the Middle East.<br /><br />2)  The question of human rights and bias:  Barely a page goes by in this `unbiased' and `well-balanced' book that doesn't say hateful or discriminatory canards about Israel and Israeli society.  One of the major canards is the question of Zionism and anti-Semitism.  We are told that Zionism causes anti-Semitism in a `cycle' of violence.  Zionism is said to cause anti-Semitism because those who oppose Israel must take their hatred out on all Jews, because Zionism identifies all Jews with Israel.  It is interesting that the book doesn't make the same excuses for those who would blame all Muslims for Sept. 11 despite Bin Ladens appeal to link all Muslims to his ideals.<br /><br />The vitriol given towards Israel is beyond just rhetoric and `anti-Zionism' it is downright shameful and hate speech directed without due observation of facts or reality.  Israel is a \\"militarist, repressive model of a racist, colonial state(page 222)\\".  \\"World Jewry is caught in a double bind of a Zionist ideology that both feeds and exploits anti-Semitism(page 223).\\"  There is virtually no understanding of the conflict and it begs the question if the writers ever even visited Israel.  An entire section is titled \\"making Palestinians invisible in Israel\\".  We are told Arab villages in Israel are without electricity and that \\"Villages find it difficult to communicate with other villages\\"(pg 144).  This is pure absurdity.  Not one `village' is without power in Israel and since Israel has standard mail services and phone service and computer internet it would be logical they can communicate.  The book claims Arab students \\"study Hebrew classics\\"(pg 145) and this is a blatant fabrication, Arabs study Arabic and Muslim law in Israel.  However the book acknowledges this by then claiming that by forcing Arabs to learn Arabic they are not made part of Hebrew Israeli society.  The book can't seem to make a decision on which anti-Israel propaganda Shtick to use.<br /><br />The Arabs are not `invisible' in Israel.  If anything their high standard of living, large single family homes and BMWs are more than visible.  The book isn't based on reality, even in the important section where it discusses Arab Christians it fails to mention the more than one dozen anti-Christian riots by Muslim Arabs in recent years(Nazareth 1999, Turan 2000, Mughar 2005, Taiba 2005).

The truth is such intolerance, hatred and bigotry simply cannot be reconciled no matter how one sits or how one prays or how one understands them.  It doesnt matter that a Muslim thinks this is the word of god, since its obvious to most people that no god would order his people to kill the rest of the world.  However we are making a presumption here, namely that the Koran can coexist in the modern world, which, aside from as a historical work, it cannot without engendering endless hatred.<br /><br />THe Koran is a historical work and just as we have become used to viewing the Bible as historical and spiritual the only honest way to approach the Koran is through the same method.  The Bible has a passage which orders the stoning of Homosexuals and yet no one today would justify that, and therefore we must apply the same logic to Koran, parts of it are outdated and simply are intended for a tribal people living in the desert in the 7th century.<br /><br />This book is propoganda for a convert to Islam.<br /><br />Seth J.

We are talking about a book that is basically a major hate text like Mien Kampf, that orders its beleivers to: \\"Slay them wherever you find them. Fight against them till idolatry is no more and God's religion reigns supreme\\" (Sura 2:190), \\"Seek out your enemies relentlessly\\" (4:103), \\"Make war on them till idolatry shall cease and God's religion shall reign supreme\\" (8:36) etc...<br /><br />If it were any other book and not a 'holy book' it would be labelled hate speach and intolerant.  Instead we are treated to long diatribes here about how the Koran is wonderful for treating women.  However how do we explain Sura 4:34 that commands the beleiver to beat his wife?  The Koran is an interesting book of history that gives us an eye into the culture of primordal Arabia, of a desert culture and how that culture wrestles with its own internal issues and deals with outsiders.  The values of the Koran, namely keeping women as second class citizens, dowries, owning slaves, and committing genocide against 'unbeleivers' are not values that make sense in the modern world, and that being said, any attempt to try to explain and appoligze for them falls short of the fact that every inch of intolerance and bigotry found in the Koran cannot be defended but must be condemned and cannot be explained.  Just as in the Bible one cannot defend morally the injunction to stone homosexuals, neither can such passages be explained away or covered up in Koran.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-09-15

Harvard is not only the center of anti-American liberalism and hateful Islamism but it is also the center of the landed aristocracy of elitists that hate the other 99% of America.  However luckily we have Mr. Larry Summers, a true gifted gentleman whose only fault has been that he dared challenge Harvard.  He began by beating down faculty attempts to divest from Harvard and invest Harvard money with the Islamist regime  in Khartoum in order to support genocide and  Summers went on to offend people by daring to admit that very few women enjoy or study science and pure math.<br /><br />This book is from an insider and full of juicy details including character and personal sketches that skewer the prefoessors in question.  We learn here how every Harvard student is indoctrinated and forced to recite the first ten verses of the Koran and how the student is given fake inflated grades, how the Core classes required at Harvard are nothing more then extreme-narrow classes on things that don't matter, that most Harvard students will graduate not knowing who fought in World War One who the Civil war, but aware of the tribal dynamics of Sub-Saharan Ghana.<br /><br />This is an excellent book, an east fun read full fo anecdotes and personal experience about the nations premier institution and perhaps shocking in its fairness and accuracy in portraying just how out of touch the American liberal left wing America hating aristocracy ahs become in America.<br /><br />Seth J.

These were not human rights vitims, but rather those who had committed human rights violations by taking part in the murder of civilians in Israel.<br /><br />However this book feels sorry for the terrorist.  THere is no compassion here for the 1200 Israelis murdered during 2000-2004.  There is however much propoganda pretending that the big bully Israel shouldnt have invaded the 'little town' of Bethlehem.<br /><br />Bethlehem is not the center of peace that Raheb weaves.  Bethlehem in 2000 was 75% Muslim, a center of Hamas activity and a ceneter of militancy.  In Biet Jala, a Christian village, Terrorists took over the houses and sniped at Jewish civilians.  Christian Palestinians took part in these activities in the name of fighting the occupation, showing that, like their muslim colleagues, they also were not readin scripture.<br /><br />The 'little town' of Bethlehem was a festering nest of terror.  The ISraeli army used its standard heavy handed tactics which always look bad on film and in the media to defeat the terror to the point of sourounding the church of the nativity.  Raheb doesnt find fault with the murderers who the church gave sanctuary too, or the fact that the terrorists brought in guns and bombs into the church, desecrating it and leaving it reaking of urine and feces.  Nope.  Apparently it was worse for Israel to souround the church then for terrorists to take it over.<br /><br />Makes plenty of sense.  Luckily 99% of Christian Arabs dont agree with this line of hated reasoning and many people were apalled by the sacking and desecration of one of Christianities most holy sites by terrorists.<br /><br />Seth J.

This is Behtlehem 2000, a place where PA laws forbid mixed marriages that allow the child to be Christian, where Christians are harrased and expelled and forced to emigrate.  A place where daily the birthplace of christ is desecrated.<br /><br />The propoganda stories about Islam abound in this book, and in general it is a text for brainwashing people to convert to Islam. Koran is placed beside Bible and Jesus is defamed.<br /><br />The pictures are the books only redemption for they show the people of Bethlehem and the town itself.  The text is pure propoganda.  In 20 years not one Christian will remain in Bethlehem, the fault of a repressive anti-minority Palestinian administration that has set its goal the ethnic cleansing of Christians.  Unfortunatly this book is only full of glowing love for the Palestinain terrorist organziations and songs from a 'refugee camp' where 90% of the residents are not refugees and where Shahid(martyr) posters of those who blew themselves up to take lives line the streets, the most un-CHristian message one could think of.  Offensive and disgusting.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-09-05

In all 37 villages are shown to have been evacuated, destroyed or converted during the war.  Most infamous of these is Dayr Yassin.  Attention is also paid to the religious institutions damaged in the fighting such as the mammoth Notre Dame complex that ended up on the Front line.  In the Old CIty and on mt. Zion many Churchs were damaged.<br /><br />COverage is given to the Christian, Armenain and Muslim communites.  The 37 villages spoken of are as far away as 25km in some instances, but some are much closer such as Rahavia or Lifta.<br /><br />Statistical breakdowns are given of businesses lost, property confiscated and land changing hands.  Very detaile descriptions are amde of UN resolutions and attempts to settle financial disputes.  Basically the city was divided in 1948 and the Jews of the Old city were depopulated from their quarter by the Jordanian army while many Arabs fled to east jerusalem.  This was not exactly a population exchange since the number of Arabs fleeing was much higher then the Jews forced from the old city.<br /><br />The book is biased.  Most damage done to Churchs is always assumed to have been done by Israeli forces rather then jordanian, when the opposite is probably the case.  It would be hard to understand how the destruction of Notre Dame or the Ethiopian CHurch in West Jerusalem could have been done by ISraeli artillary unless it was firing at its own positions.<br /><br />It is also not easy to excuse the blatent fabrications concerning the destruction of the Jewish quarter of the old city.  If this book perports to cover property damage from the war it is decidedly one sided as the title implies.<br /><br />Nevertheless researchers on the war will find the information indespensible, the writing however is lacking in objectivity.<br /><br />Seth J.

In debunking and revising the history of ancient Israel we necessary therefore cast great doubts on the origins and beliefs of Islam.  It is interesting that the very same Palestinians and pro-Palestinians will reject the idea of an ancient Israel but at the same time argue for the temple mount being 'the third holies site in Islam' for the two are mutually exclusive.  If, as is argued here, ancient Israel didn't exist, then neither did the temple that Mohammed is supposed to have flown to on a night journey on a winged donkey named al-Buraq.<br /><br />The problem with revisionism is that when one begins to revise history they then must go through and revise all history since it is all connected.  If ancient Israel didn't exist then where did the Jews of Yemen and Ethiopia come from?  if ancient Israel didn't exist and the Jews are khazars then why is Jerusalem to holy to Muslims? If Ancient Israel didn't exist then what tradition did Jesus call upon, why then is Israel mentioned by Alexander the Great at a time when its not supposed to be unified according to this history.<br /><br />Revisionism like this begs many questions.  Archeology's claims on Israel, as supported by the anti-Israel Copenhagen school, are based not only on modern politics, the science of archeology having been infected by politics and religion, but its only argument is lack of evidence is evidence.  Therefore according to this school Mongols and Native Americans didn't exist since there is little evidence for either in archeology, but if they didn't exist then who sacked Baghdad?<br /><br />This book holds little water, its arguments are simply that no clear evidence exists, besides the Bible and Alexander the great and classical works, for the claim of a unified ancient Israel state.  However the same book claims, without any shred of evidence whatsoever, for an ancient palestinian-canaanite identity.<br /><br />It is pure politics this study, not archeology of history, but polemic at its best.

After the fall of Rome the Vandals came from Europe through to Morrocco and North Africa.  later in the 8th century the Arabs, newly converted to Islam, swept through Morocco on their way to Jihad in Europe.  Later, after the reconquista of Spain in 1492 the Spanish moved into Morocco, at first to free European slaves.  In the 1700-1800s Morocco was on seat of the Barbary pirates who plagued European ships and took European slaves.  In the late 18th century this all ended and the cycle began anew with the French conquest.  The SPanish had a small northern strip of Morocco but this book focuses only on the French role, which is perhaps a disappointing for the Spanish war with the Mountain Rif(Berber) tribes was as interesting if not more so.<br /><br />This book, like Porch's others, is very good, artfully told, beautifully rendered, an easy fun and popular read.

It is a two part assault beginning with the cover.  In a book ostensibly about who is and isn't an `anti-Semite' and why Dershowitz is wrong we are given a picture of a concrete wall, part of a border constructed by Israel to keep terrorists out.<br /><br />The argument is that `anti-Semite' is an over applied accusation used by those who defend Israel in order to tar their opponents.  It is ironic that this accusation comes from the same author who later in the book accuses of Israel of being a `racist' and `apartheid' state.  Since the argument against using the word `anti-Semite' loosely is that it is slander then why does the same book go on to needlessly slander its opponents.  If overuse of `anti-Semite' is indeed unfair then isn't overuse of `racist' the same thing.<br /><br />Onward.  Anti-Semitism refers to the term used by a German theorist as a way to hate Jews based on race and not based on religion in a secular Europe.  Since it turned out later that Arabs were also Semitic the term is problematic.  The reason Israel critics are brought in for the term is their rampant fabrication regarding Israel and their blatant hate for the country, which is, unfortunately, the only country with a majority of Jews in the world.  Since many anti-Israel rallies have signs that show the Star of David(Israel's symbol) interlaced with the swastika(the sign of the ideology that tried to exterminate Jews) it is quite clear the connection.  Since anti-Israel ideologues accuse Jews of controlling the media to support Israel, the claim once again is accurate.  Since anti-Israel people are connected by degree in many instances with those who deny the Holocaust, for instant Islamists, once again the phrase is accurate.  Finkelstien doesn't like being called an `anti-Semite' and this is the crux of his problem.  However the second half of this book simply contradicts his own original point.  If its not `fair' to label all anti-Israel people anti-Semites then why does he go on to make outlandish claims regarding Israel, outright lies about Israeli justice systems and total fabrications of Israeli history?<br /><br />Anyone who would go so far as to claim Japan didn't have a right to exist and that it was the center of racism and friction in the world would be `anti-Japanese'.  Since Jews are Semites and Israel is a Jewish country, therefore the same rule applies.  Those who hate Israel are anti-Semites.  It is ironic that Finkelstien uses B'Tselem data, since by his very definition everything in Israel is racist and inhumane, if that be so then why rely at the same time on Israeli data?<br /><br />A faulty, racist book.<br /><br />Seth J.

It is NOT comprehensive, rather it tries to be comprehensive in demonstrating the many types of verbs, hollow verbs, weak verbs, and verbs from the several `buildings'.  Arabic is a complicated language and it is helpful to have these things demonstrated for the reader and student.  However this book does not work as a reference for verbs or words, because it isn't alphabetical, rather it is based on category of verb.  It is of limited use therefore in translation, it is rather a verb structure manual.  It does have all the active and passive and the participles and the Masdar nicely drawn out and this is helpful for understanding the pattern of Arabic.  However beyond this the book does not come in handy the way it should, in general it doesn't have enough verbs.  Most linguists assume that one needs 500 verbs in order to know a language.  This book includes obscure verbs no one will ever use while simple verbs are missing because they repeat a pattern already demonstrated.  For those in Arabic studies this is an essential book, but it needs updating or expanding.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-08-29

Bediuzzaman  was born before the destruction of the Ottoman empire and served as a loyal servent of that empire in Europe suppressing Albanian and Greek uprisings.  He was in that a colonizer and imperialist, ironically the exact same things he condemned in what he saw as western imperialism in the post war period.  In essence he beleived Islamic empire was acceptable and good, while 'infidel' empire was bad.<br /><br />Later in life during the war he was involved in the November 1914 proclomation of 'Jihad' by the Caliphate against the Western powers in WWI.  In 1915 in Turkey's war against the Russians Bediuzzaman took part in the Armenian genocide and its subsequent cover up.  Genocide is not sopposed to be part of 'Jihad' at least not according to this book where we are told Islam is only tolerance and ethics.  One account of the period states \\"As for Bediuzzaman and his followers, they used to pursue the Armenians mercilessly\\".  Bediuzzaman said \\"Muslim's belief is stronger than any power\\" at this time.<br /><br />In the aftermath of war and Ataturkism's victory and the advent of secularism Bediuzzaman and his ideas seemed to wain.  Women were given the vote in Turkey and universities were opened to women, in many ways making Turkish society more equal and progressive in 1922 than most 'western' nations.<br /><br />Through the 1950s Bediuzzaman and the Risale-i Nur movement he founded continued to obsess not only over the role of Islam and the importance of Koran but also \\"dangers facing the country from communism and freemasonry and urging [the government] to restore the Qur'an and truths of belief.\\"<br /><br />The idea was quite clear. Mr. Bediuzzaman was  obsessed not only with turning back the clock on the progressive improvements made by the secular government of Ataturk but he was conspiratorial in his obsession with freemasonries role in society.  These beliefs engendered the kind of fanaticism that led to bombings and terrorism against Mason lodges, Western banks, tourist resorts, and the murder and torture of feminist authors in Turkey.<br /><br />These results are not mere critique of 'globalization' as this book pretends.  In fact Islam itself is globalization, simply put it is a differing view of globalization then what Bediuzzaman termed the 'materialist' 'naturalist' world of 'philosophy'.  In short his message was a furture of the \\"Qur'an holding sway over the future, the age of science and reason\\".  This is religious fanaticism and to put suimilar ideas in the mouths of Pat Robertson or Jerry Fallwell makes them seem part of the lunatic fringe, however becuase they come from a Muslim we are told they are acceptble worldviews, even progressive, in this account.<br /><br />Forthermore this book's introduction obsesses over confronting the 'worldview' of Daniel Pipes, an American historian on political Islam.  Why Pipes is mentioned is not clear since he has nothing to do with Bediuzzaman, but it shows insecurity on the part of the book, insecurity that somehow a 'Pipes worldview' is brainwashing us all on Islam.  However reading what Bediuzzaman has to say in his own words should be enough to concince us that his rejection of science, philosophy and equal rights is all we need to know.<br /><br />Seth J.

Anyone involved in the dubious idea of the one-state solution is tilting at windmills and obviously has no concept of history.  Lets review a few other 'one state' solutions that didnt work.  The Ottoman empire, the Russian Empire, the Soviet empire, the Austro-Hungarian empire, Yugoslavia, Czechslovakia and Lebanon.  In each case two communities, usually involving different relgions or ethnicities or languages, were forced to coexist in one state.  In each case the outcome was breakup and or bloodbath.<br /><br />Israel is then being asked in this pie in the sky book to accept 9 million palestinian 'refugees' to live in a state the saze of new jersey and not only that but to have a 'jewish state' as well without a jewish majority.  In reality what this solution entails is not a 'one state' for two peoples but rather Greater Palestine.<br /><br />Palestinians already form the majority in their territories(West Bank and Gaza) and Jordan and have 25% of Israel.  It has been an awful failure of ISrael not to grant autonomy or democracy in the territories where roughly 2 million Palestinians live.  This is true, since settlers in the territories vote and Arabs do not.  Only in the Golan and east Jerusalem has citizenship been extended to all.<br /><br />However we are told in this book it is not possible for Israel to dismanlte the settlements, and then the disengagement proved it was in 2005.  If Israel can successfully pull out of Gaza then its only a matter of time before a Palestinian state comes into being.  And eventually perhaps two palestinians states(one in Jordan as well) and in the future when demographics catch up with Israel there will be three Palestinian state as Israel also becomes Palestinian.<br /><br />Its not a one state solution, its actually a three state solution.<br /><br />Seth J. frantzman	2005-08-29

Due to Mcllelan like preparations he did not launch Operation Crusader until 18th November, 1941.  Because of Birtish success Rommel abandoned his siege of Tobruk on the 4th of December and began a long retreat back to his supply base.  However it was not to last, although not covered in this book, Rommel regrouped with reinforcements and by 29th of Janurary had recaptured Benghazi.

This book is addressing the latter, but we must address both.  Zionism is a nationaist idea coming from the late 19th century.  It is nationalist and religious and secular(one of many ironies) and embraces the Jewish people's quest for a nation.  We must view it as we view pan-Turkism.  pan-Tukism views the Turks as a people, but the Turks are also Muslim, thus it encompasses religion and nation. Jews are basically the same, a nation wrapped inside a religion, like all old tribal religions used to be and like Hindu Nationalism is today, and we might at Japan is.<br /><br />Zionism was socialist.  It looked for a land, originally Uganda, and then Israel, which shoes just how unreligious it originally was, since it didnt see Israel as essential.<br /><br />In Israel is did suprisingly well and like most national movements it envisioned a 'greater' version of the homeland, like 'greater' Greece or 'greater' Serbia, or Ukraine.<br /><br />The critique is that it doenst have clean hands.  Most ideologies dont.  Ideology and its affects are not two in the same.  COmmunism isnt inherently evil, but it is responsible for evil.<br /><br />However the contemporary critique of zionism is decidedly a left wing communist view that nation doesnt matter.  But then COmmunism died and so did Zionism.  Zionism and its ideals died long ago.  So why is this book trying to put a new spin on it?

In order to come to this conclusion a few brigades are employed to challenge the standard view.  First the book argues that since some Southern Democrats supported affirmative action and since they are perceived as racists who cared for the status quo therefore affirmative action was initially a conspiracy to keep the structure the same.  Second the book assaults the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act was in fact unsatisfactory because it didn't help everyone, only factory workers.  No sacred cows here, the G.I bill which was 100% color blind, is assaulted because the majority of those who took advantage of it were white.<br /><br />The argument here is quite brilliant.  Since Whites seem to succeed and since some affirmative action projects didn't do what they were intended it is all supposedly a conspiracy against African-Americans.  However this begs the question if perhaps without affirmative action what would the outcome have been.  If all these labor standards, the GI bill and affirmative action are racist, then should they be done away with.  In fact the GI bill is not a fair example since it is not `affirmative'.  The premise of affirmative action is that given to equal candidates the African American candidate must be chosen based on his race and `underprivileged' status.  The central bases for affirmative action is a reliance on racism.  In this the book is correct, but not in the case of the GI bill.  Since we are told by the same critics that Blacks were overrepresented in the armed forces then logically they would have been in a better and disproportionate place to take advantage of the color blind GI bill.  They didn't take advantage of it apparently, or not in great numbers.  However the only people to blame for this are the people who didn't take advantage, not the government who extended the hand of help in a color bland manner, in a way Dr. King would have approved of.<br /><br />Not a well argued text.<br /><br />Seth J.

The dollar has weakened against other currencies...well really just against the Euro.  U.S national Debt is high and so is personal debt in America.  Corporations have failed and scandals have taken place.  Inflation may happen again.  Because of these things the Dollar is dead and people had better invest elsewhere, by purchasing overseas traveling more, buying gold or buying euros and stuffing them in mattresses or shorting the dollar or buying futures of other currencies.<br /><br />If it was true that the dollar was dying then the investment strategies would be intelligent, however the dollar isn't going anywhere.  The dollar is still the number of exchanged currency in the world.  On the border of Israel and Egypt at Taba the duty free shop has prices in dollars.  In Cuba the second cash economy is black market dollars.  In Iraq Saddam was caught with a suitcase full of....you guessed it, dollars.  In China they look to the dollar to decide what to do with the Yuan and whether to float it.  In Argentina they tried tying their currency to the dollar and destroyed their economy, but it was the fact that they choose the dollar as the goal, not the Euro.  The Yen, Yuan and the Euro may be important, and the Ran and the Ruble and even the Dinar and the Rupee, but the almighty dollar is still  the one currency that the world looks to and U.S markets are the only markets that affect the world.  Declines in Asian currencies and Europeans ones don't affect each-other without the dollar intervening.  The dollar may have traded down against the Euro as of late but this is a temporary problem.  Perhaps in 100 years things will be different, but investors who are investing for today certainly cant look out to the future that long, since many things may very well be different in that amount of time.  This book is all sensationalism and is simply not accurate.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-08-26

Those targeted in this book fall into a number of categories from anti-American journalists, to America-hating academics, to those in the media and in Hollywood.  From Michael Moore to Al Franken.  They may not literally be `ruining' the country but their bile, their viewpoints are so negative, distorted and hateful that they are indeed bringing the nation down by poisoning the minds of the youth and encouraging young Americans to either tune out the government or make up astonishing lies about their country, which just happens to be the freest, richest and most philanthropic and open minded country in the world.  Americans are religious, but have the most diversity of religion, Americans have pride in work and American business is the most powerful.  Americans are the most diverse country in the world despite all the accusations of racism.  American military power is use selectively but justly, unlike other nations that were the most powerful in the  world at their time.  American aid single handedly supports the UN and most projects in Africa and elsewhere and American philanthropy fund the most art in the world.<br /><br />Yet many American academics, intellectuals, rich elites and Hollywood `blowhards' hate their own nation and spend endless hours blasting it in books, on TV and in the lecture hall.  This book takes them to task and yes it names names.  We know that Liberals and the radical left have always used character assassination to destroy people like Justice Thomas or Jerry Fallwell, or Gengrich or Guliani or Rush.  One by one the radical hateful left has used its machine of academics and the media and Hollywood to poor sewage and lies on many American figures,  from painting Hitler mustaches on Hitler to calling Rush a `big fat idiot'.  Finally someone is giving it back in spades, telling us the truth about many characters that got away with so much before.  Now we are served up a warm dish with all those on it who for so long have loud mouthed their way into our living rooms and newspapers.  Finally we are told the truth about them.  Finally we are given a book that even uncovers some we didn't know about, some professors and journalists busy sabotaging America, busy saying they hoped we would suffer \\"a million Mogadishu's(referring to the deaths of 18 U.S servicemen in Somalia) in Iraq\\".<br /><br />A wonderful, fun, jibe of a read.

Eritrea didnt used to exist.  Originally its coast line was a colony of arabs from arabia who used it as a slave trading stop ont the way to the Red Sea. The rest of the interior was Coptic Christians and culturally part of Ethiopia. When the Italians arrived in the late 1800s eritrea became the jumping off point for the invasion of Ethiopia, which failed miserably in 1896 at Adowa and was not completed until Mussolinis invasion in  1935 using gas against the Ethiopians.<br /><br />Haile selassie governed Eritrea and Ethiopia from the 1920s until 1975 when he was killed by Marxists.  Eritrea had by this time been fighting for independence for some time.  Although the war was couched in cold war terms of freedom against colonization and the fighters pretended to be Che, the real war was about religion, it was about Muslims in Eritrea and coastal arabs wanting to dominate the Coptic Christian minority, and it was about economics, the  Ethiopian need for a port to the sea.<br /><br />In the end the brutal war cost many lives and the Americans were involved on the side of the Eritreans, another exmaple of American support for Muslims, while the Soviets supported the Marxists in Addis Abbaba.  The country was brought to its knees until independence in 1993.  This book claims the Europeans and meddling cold war adversaries destroyed the country.  However the corruption of Eritrea has nothing to do with outsiders, sicne few if any exist in Eritrea anymore, rather it has everything to do with the people themselves.  The imperialists and the Cold war did intervene, but the 'freedom fighters' were home grown.  In fact without support from europeans and the fake creation of the country by Italy in the first place it might well never have existed.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-08-26

However the picture painted her is moslty lies.  Arab parts of Israel appear in poverty but this is deceptive.  Statistics prove otherwise.  The Arab houses in Israel are on averare 150% larger then Israeli ones, partly becuase 90% of Arabs in Israel own land and have a home, whereas more than half of Jews live in apartments which are much smaller and do not own land.  87% of all BMWs sold in ISrael and the territories are sold to Arabs and the same figure is for SUVs and other expensive cars.  This doesnt belli a poor people, it shows wealth is different in Arab areas, Arab areas are dominated by larger homes and expensive cars and less savings and larger families.<br /><br />This book pretends to 'show the Israel we never see on TV' but this is also a lie.  98% of all reports in the international media cover palestinians, palestinian human rights and conditions, palestinian children, medicine and sports and human rights and charaties in palestinian arab areas.  In fact on TV all we ever see is reports from the 'other side' most people in the west have never even seen a report on how the average Israeli lives.<br /><br />This book is mostly falshood from a perosn who knows no arabic and doesnt check out statistics and figures on Palestinians or Israeli-Arabs.<br /><br />Seth J.

Because of this line of thought all manner of Catholic crimes have been conjured up to such a degree that the Church is now `implicated in the Holocaust'.  Nothing could be further from the truth and finally this book sets the record strait on a controversial Pope who lives in troubled times.<br /><br />The major accusations against Pius XII is that he did little to stop the Holocaust, that he was friendly with the Germans due to his long experience in German affairs and that he didn't do enough to save the Jews or Rome.  Lastly he is accused not only of knowledge of the Holocaust but in conspiring to steal Jewish orphan children given over to the Catholic church in this period.<br /><br />Let us examine some of the reality.  Nazism was a pagan barbarian ideology that had roots in socialism and the utopian ideals of futurism combined with race theory.  Nazism was not Christian and the Holocaust had nothing to do with Christianity.  The Catholic church was strong in nations like Austria, Croatia and Poland, as well as Southern Germany, where the biggest Nazis and Nazi-allied movements came from and where the largest number of Jews were killed.  However despite these facts many Catholic priests were also assaulted, arrested and deported or murdered either for speaking out against Nazism or for the mere crime of being Catholic.  New records have shown Hitler's hatred for the Church and his plots against it, especially the plot to kidnap Pius XII.<br /><br />Pius XII lived in harsh times.  Confronted with the atheist scourge of communism and knowledgeable about the fate of Catholics under communism he felt that the Church would be better treated under Pagan fascism and Nazism.  The advent of war made protecting Church assets and people number one on his list.  Jews were not Catholics and tragically this was not a high priority for the church.  However many Jewish converts to Catholicism were sent to the camps by the Nazis under the race laws and the church protested these things.  Not only this but the Church hid thousands of Jews in Italy after the Nazi coup in 1943(Mussolini was toppled and Germany took over Italy).  Well aware of threats to kidnap him Pius nevertheless condemned Nazism and racialism.  The church protected 10s of thousands of Jewish orphans and it is sheer audacity for those who call Pius `Hitler's pope' do insult the church for saving Jewish children.  It is almost as if they are saying it would be better the children were dead then catholic.  In the end the Church made many mistakes, but mistakes that do not warrant the slander imposed on Pius XII.  He may not have been a saint but he was no Pope of Hitler either.<br /><br />(...)lly this was not a high priority for the church.

Patrick Sookhdeo writes a sobering account of genocide in the Sudan.  Raphael Israeli covers the `re-islamization' of the Balkans and examines the role of Jihadis and imported Arabs in the Kosovo war and the Bosnian war.  K.P.S. Gill and Ajai Shni look at islams role in south east Asia, particularly the Islamist terror in Thailand  and Indonesia, and perhaps leading the reader to look deeper at Islamic terror in China and the Phillipines.  Joseph Farah and Shaul Shay take a deeper look into the maturization of the new radical Islam in the Afghan war, and Algeria and Lebanon and how they single handedly declared war on the rest of the world.  Also noted here is how in the west Islamists and their apologists `play the press'.  A third section covers `unconventional weapons' but unfortunately doesn't cover the unconventional means, whereby terrorism has learned to defeat armies since democracies and western nations with western concepts of Human rights cannot confront radical Islam on the battlefield fairly.  Islamists use and exploit the west's laws in order to defeat the west and murder `infidels'. David Bukay does an excellent job of summing up the book which he edited.  This is a new edition to book examining the role of Islamism and its mutli-faceted approach is helpful because it gives the reader a variety of perspectives.  The book is both scholaraly and intelligent and easy to grasp for the general audience.  The inflammatory title may distract some from this book, but this is a very down to earth well reasoned address of many islamist issues and islamist causes many of which, like South east asia, go unnoticed.<br /><br />Seth J. frantzman	2005-08-26

Religion has been responsible for terrible things, the inquisition, today's Islamist terrorism, Jihad, the problems in Northern Ireland, Kashmir, Sudan, Nigeria.  Everywhere we see religious violence and religious belief on the rise.  The answer of this book is that religion is the problem and it shouldn't exist.<br /><br />There are several problems here, first among them is the simple minded idea that `religion' is defined as basically the big two:  Christianity and Islam, with Judaism thrown in for good measure so it to can get blamed for something.  However secularism is also a religious belief system, communism is religious in its doctrinal ideas and rejection of `heresy'.  Religion is not just what we think of as religion, rather religion has always existed and crushing the two main religions that exist in the world today won't end religious violence.  People yearn for a higher power and holy book and in general they yearn for fanaticism and a black and white world.  We see today in the liberal acceptance and support for militant Islam simply a refreshing of the leftist communist view that the world is Black and white and Islam is simply another version of communism where everyone is either a `believer' or an `unbeliever'.<br /><br />The solution posed here is that religion is responsible for everything.  The Holocaust is blamed on the Jews and the Catholics, an odd twist since not only were the Jews the main victims, but Catholics priests were also killed and Nazism was a pagan barbarian idea based on idealistic utopian ideas of socialism and futurism.  Nazism was a religion unto itself, but it wasn't Christianity they birthed Nazism.<br /><br />Bill Graham and the evangelicals and the Born again Christians of America are compared in this book to Bin Laden, but there is no comparison, while one advocates the murder of civilians to conquer the world, the other plays with ideas of salvation and rebirth in Christ, no suicide bombers are found there.  Hinduism, Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, these other religions don't come in for much critique but this book apparently advocates their suppression as well.<br /><br />Since most leftists have suddenly found themselves loving religion again and telling us we must be tolerant it is good to see a book that dares to open peoples mind and tell us not to be too tolerant of religion and this is a necessary message.  However the conclusion may not be correct.  The destruction of organized religion and the imposition of rationality will only lead to a new religion, and a new fanaticism.induism, Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, these other religions don't come in for much critique but this book apparently advocates their suppression as well. <br /> <br />Since most leftists have suddenly found themselves loving religion again and telling us we must be tolerant it is good to see a book that dares to open peoples mind and tell us not to be too tolerant of religion and this is a necessary message.

Now he applies his wonderful talents as a historian and writer to the Jewish experience in modern times from the 17th century to today.  He examines European anti-semtism and the rise of nationalism alongside the enlightenment and the new rights for Jews.  Also looked at is the situation of Jews in Muslim lands and elsewhere, subjects usually given short shrift in books of this kind.  Finally we are given excellent portraits of Jewish migration to the Americans and within Europe.  Most are not aware that in 1930 many of the Jews in Germany and France were recent arrivals from the east, Jews from the Shtetl of Russia and Ukraine escaping persecution, dire poverty and revolution.  These Jews contrasted greatly with the `liberated' and `assimilated' Jews of Germany who had created the reform movement. Important Jewish personalities like the Rothschilds are interwoven along with fascinating stories about Jews in Latin America and elsewhere.<br /><br />This is a tour de force, as always well written and researched and easily readable.<br /><br />Seth J.

Beginning with the romantic version of Islam as brought back by Sir Richard Francis Burton and T.E. Lawrence the English speaking world has been enamored with Muslims.  Then came September 11th.  Since then every American and most in the world who are non-Muslims have been indoctrinated with the zombie-like incantation \\"Islam is a religion of peace\\".  Furthermore such key concepts of the reason why 9/11 happened have been turned on their heads.  `Jihad' has been told to us that it means `inner struggle' and in fact that `holy war' is therefore peaceful.  We have been brainwashed to believe that Islamic veils and `hajib' or the veering of women is actually liberating for women and liberal western women are the number one converts to Islam because of this propaganda.  We have been told that Islam is the most peaceful religion, as if such a thing is possible, and that Islamic slavery was `humane' and that Islamic Dhimmi law is actually a wonderful way for people to live as second class citizens.  The fact that Islam took over 1/3 of the world and committed genocide against millions of non-Arab and non-Muslims peoples and destroyed 1000s of native religions is brushed over, while any instance where those who were colonized by Muslims and dared to defend themselves is characterized as `religious hatred' by the non-Muslims.  In short, in the last 4 years the entire world has been caught up in a mass psychosis that only books like this can relieve.  This is the proscription.  Truth and honesty is the proscription. Since not everyone can go out and read every Hadith, digest every Sunna, visit every muslim country, read the Koran in its original, learn the differences between Alawites and Sufis and go on the Haj and since not everyone knows the intricate history of all the myriad conflicts in the world involving Muslims against non-Muslims, this book is a useful primer.<br /><br />This book dares to dispute the unthinkable.  It dares to question all these closed minded assertions we have heard.  It dares to ask `perhaps Islam isn't a religion of peace'  and examine `when was Islam peaceful?'.  Has their been one year in the entire history of Islam where a Jihadist hasn't murdered a non-muslim for the very simple reason that he wasn't a `believer'.  This book finally sheds true light on the treatment of homosexuals and women and minorities in Muslim countries.  We were brainwashed to believe that the Iranian revolution and its forced veiling of an entire nation of women was a wonderful thing, we were told that the fact that Iranian non-muslims became second class citizens was  a value we should strive for and that executing and beheading men for committing homosexualits was therefore a great value.  Well we were lied to, this book gives out truth and dares to break down walls of accepted idiocy.

These are mostly `Israelis' who have left Israel like Avi Shalim or Baruch Kimmerling or people such as Ilan Pappe, historians and critics who all argue that Israels history is full of genocidal intentions and that Israel shouldn't exist and that Jews should return `home' to Europe.  Each one of these articles is full of hate speech.  The conclusions are always standard fare, Israel is unabashedly evil, everything Israel has ever done is evil and conspiratorial.  Israel is one of the `greatest threats to world peace'.  Israel is one of the `most brutal states in world history'.  Israel is constantly compared to the Nazi regime.  This book is a good example, a wonderful symbol of what the left is capable of when left to its own hateful intentions for this book argues that Jews deserve to be `cleansed' from Israel to make way for `greater palestine' of Israel, the west bank, gaza and Jordan.  Most of these authors claim to be Israeli but more than half left Israel long ago either for higher pay or to be among their intellectual hate-israel allies in the west.<br /><br />This book chronicles the left.  It chronicles the basic title `whose left in Israel' and the question itself is full of hate speech for it implies that those who are not leftist and don't agree with the opinions here don't deserve to exist and in fact according to these internationalists they don't even exist in Israel.  The idea is that anyone that doesn't agree isn't `left' in Israel to be spoken to or understood.  Basically the message is no one is left in Israel and therefore Israel should be destroyed.  Those in this book call terrorists `freedom fighters' and when buses full of children are blown up in Jerusalem these authors say that is `collateral damage' for the `ultimate freedom of the Palestinian struggle'.<br /><br />This is a basic hate text, like Mien Kamp and Protocols of the elders of zion, full leftist hate fiction.

While more than a million Americans died in brutal fighting involving armies of 100,000 men, bands of Sioux fought a war in Minnesota against settlers. This book looks into claims that `thousands' of white settlers were killed.  In the end the uprising was put down and 303 and Sioux were sentenced to death, a large number for a tribe that numbered only in the area of 10,000 people or less.  In the end 28 were hung. Lincoln took a personal interest in the matter and at a time when 1000s of American soldiers were dying daily on the battlefield he became concerned with the lives of 28 native-Americans.  In this we see the lie put to sleep that Americans of the time saw Indians as only blood thirsty savages, instead we see that Lincoln was a just man, not only interested in freeing slaves, but also interested in saving the lives of native Americans.  He hoped to review and reform U.S  Indian policy but his untimely death did not allow it.  Instead further wars were fought with the Sioux tribes, primarily the Dakota and Hunkpapa tribes over control of the Black Hills.  Celebrated chiefs came out of those conflicts such as Red Cloud and Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse and the famous Custer last stand.

In well inked, and touched up drawings this wonderful book tells a gripping story of the search for the truth not only behind the original Protocols, a document drawn up by the Tsarist secret service to implicate Jews in a worldwide conspiracy, but also its enduring legend.  We see Hitler speaking in a Beer Hall, we see Henry Ford and his racist book \\"the International Jew\\".  We see how the book and the myth have been again and again disproven and how it lives on as an enduring idea not only in the west but also abroad.  We see it travel to the New World and then we see it's first published copies in Arabic, its distribution by Arab governments and its popularity even in China.<br /><br />We see today how the myth of the Protocols has even infiltrated leftist and liberal thought, so that one scene in the book tells the true story of how an 'ethnic student association' at an eastern liberal arts school distributed the paper at its rallies on 'culture day'.  We see how it has led in the last few years to hundreds of bombings of Jewish places of worship and Jewish graveyards, in short today's liberals and neo-Nazis in Europe are completing the job that Hitler started.  Jewish graveyards left untouched by the Nazis in France are today daily assaulted and desecrated, not just by the skinheads but by Islamists and radical leftist students who claim they must spray swastikas on graves to 'fight for palestine'.<br /><br />This is a wonderful, beautiful book, very adult in its content, character and depictions but done in a revolutionary format that will recall many of Maus and Persepolis both 'comic' style literature that addressed serious topics.<br /><br />Seth J.

Nations don't simply take over parts of the world by mistake or overnight.  People in general do not convert en masse to religions other then their own.  However when we address the history of Islam we have become conditioned to believe that Islam just existed, it sort of magically came into being and 1/3 of the world magically came under its sway overnight.  Then we are told that barbarous Christian's intent only on greed and murder assaulted peaceful Islam through crusades from Spain to the Holy land.  This evil crusading didn't stop until colonialism extended over almost all Muslims.  This is the classic western and Islamic narrative.  But its not the whole story.  There was a time when Muslims too reveled in their accomplishments, their great campaigns against infidels and the great booty, then they realized that such stories didn't read well in the new anti-war tolerant secular west and they presented the rise of Islam differently.  There was a time when accounts reveled in Mohammad of Ghaznis destruction of thousands of `idolatrous temples' in India and his `200,000 slaves' that he took back with him in the 11th century.  Now we are told that Islam is basically indigenous to India, it never colonized India, it just mushroomed up suddenly.  History books today wont tell any readers that the ottoman empire was a colonial empire that colonized Arabs in the middle east and Christians in Eastern Europe, instead we are told that the Ottoman empire sort of peacefully conquered ¼ of Europe and then it was the evil Europeans who had designs on carving up that `sick man of Europe' and forcing the ottomans to enact laws that protected minorities and ended slavery.<br /><br />This book opens our eyes.  This book dares to ask the questions \\"How did Islam expand?\\" and \\"what happened to non-Muslims in conquered areas?\\".  In a sense what is being asked also is `how did north Africa and the middle east become Arabic and Anatolia Turkish?'  Without war and genocide its not possible that any of these regions would look as they do today.  In the 7th century when Islam conquered parts of Persia and Byzantium the region was 90% Zoroastrian and Christian.  Today it is roughly 1% of those two faiths.  What happened to them.<br /><br />This book shows that the Islamic treatment of non-Muslims amounted to the fate of those conquered in the new world by Europeans.  Non-Muslims were discriminated against, made slaves, raped and then became second class citizens.  In an insatiable thirst for slaves and women for harems(places of sexual slavery) Islam declared Jihads deep into Africa and Europe, depopulating Eastern Europe and the coast of Africa.  The experience of natives was the same as the fate of native in the Americas...genocide and eventually conversion, with a few hold outs.  An excellent sobering account.<br /><br />Seth J.

Although some prior knowledge is assumed, for instance an idea of the difference between Islam and Christianity, an idea of what a German is and a Latin.  However in general this concise read covers the ground well and unlike other books doesnt telescope the history to the present, allowing the reader to take in the last three or four centuries and not spend 2/3 of the book on the crises of the last ten years.<br /><br />The Balkans is complicted and complex, hence the word 'balkanization'.  I would have liked to see more religious, ethnic history. For instance more information on linguistic differneces and the shifting pattersn of migration.  However this book is a tour de force, beggining with descrptions of the landscape it takes the reader from the 4th century to the most modern one, showing the complex history of this complex region.<br /><br />Seth J.

The subject is the Americas in the period before Columbus and the ravages of western diseases.  The claims are deeply speculative and some will say revisionist.  They are basically trying to get at three perplexing questions. 1) What was the population of the Americas before Columbus and what was its economic development? 2)  When did Americans first arrive and from where and by what?  3)  What happened to this civilization.<br /><br />We are told by new scholarship that perhaps Americans immigrated from Siberia or across the pacific not 11,000 years ago but 20,000 years ago.  We are also now finding that population densities were much higher then previously thought, not only among the Aztecs and Incas but in the Mississippi valley and elsewhere.  At the same time we learn that technology of the Native Americans was higher and more progressed then previously thought.  Lastly we are told the claim that diseases whipped out between 90-98% of the people living in America at this time.<br /><br />These are radical new claims, especially the claims regarding Native American tampering with the environment.  These are interesting claims and perhaps some of them are true.  There are however several reservations.  Evidence for the arrival of Americans 20,000 years ago is scant and based on only a few sites where carbon dating may have been wrongly applied.  Secondly, the population densities of the Americas have been widely claimed as larger, especially in Diamonds well received book `Guns, Germs and Steel'.  The idea that diseases brought by Europeans lead to one of the worst epidemics in world history, ten times worse then the great plague, is also rehashed from previous studies.  The wonderful thing about this book is it presents the new ideas in a clear and convincing format, easily digestible and a fascinating read.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-08-19

He was not a specialist on the Middle East. However in the same way that the Americans who created democracy in Japan(Mcarthur) and Germany(Eisenhower) were not experts on those civilizations, it doesn't take an expert who has learned biases through his expertization of the people, rather it takes pragmatism and a good mind.  Arabs themselves have conquered many peoples and regions without being experts and brought Islamic civilization to those places, so it is ironic to hear them complain that only a true arabist could dare to go to Iraq.  What was needed in Iraq was impartiality and a good sense of how to get things done and how to confront terror, as well as help from the locals. In the end either these things were squandered or didn't exist.<br /><br />The march to Baghdad was a success, a military marvel.  However in the coming years more then 1700 American servicemen would be killed, hundreds of foreigners kidnapped and brutally murdered and more then 20,000 Iraqis fall as victims of terrorism mostly caused by outside Jihadis.  Iraq we have been told is not a political unit, this is not entirely correct.  Most of Iraq is Arab, and the Kurdish speaking areas have only recently been autonomous.  Places like Kirkuk have had fluid populations, once Turkmen then Arab and now Kurdish.  Border change often in the middle east, and 90% of those changes were made by Arab governments in the past before the 1800s.  However Iraqs diversity and its history means that creating a stable government and a democracy would be hard, new democracies have a hard time when there are large social cleavages, hence we saw democracy eclipsed in the 1930s.  Homogenous countries usually fare better.<br /><br />In the end America may have squandered the victory.  This book doesn't see the central problem however.  The Americans succeeded in Germany and Japan in 1945 because they were ruthless towards terrorism, especially towards ex-nazi terror against American forces in Germany.  Secondly America succeeded because it quickly co-opted local elites who wanted to run the occupied countries.  Lastly it succeeded because it empowered the new elites to crush dissent when necessary.  In Iraq the average Iraq policemen spent 7/8ths of his training learning about the Geneva convention and human rights, rather then learning state of the art anti-terror methods.  Iraqi policemen who put their lives on the line for their nation were ruthlessly slaughtered in droves by the insurgents, and America did little to back them up or arm them or give them leeway and power.  This was at the heart of the problem.  A good read, but needs more focus and work.<br /><br />Seth J.

Bush	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Quite Brilliant with small flaws	This very original piece of work describes the history and biological basis of nepotism.  This book has been described as a `polemic' which it surely is not, instead it is an interesting, very calmly argued accounting of nepotism through the ages.  The riveting begins with a description of the Godfather and nepotism in America, especially the widely held view that George Bush and Al Gore are examples of the `new' American nepotism.  The argument proceeds to describe nepotism in non-western societies, such as China, Africa and of course the caste system of India, including biological descriptions of nepotism among animals and nepotism at the tribal and clan level.  Then we are given an introduction to western nepotism, the Romans, the Greeks, the Jews, the rise of the Church and Charlemagne's family.<br /><br />The second section of the book describes nepotism in America from the 1700s to the present.  The waves of American immigration are discussed, the separate cultures of North and South, the rise of the Boston Brahmins, the Roosevelt's and the Kennedy's.  Given the claim that nepotism has deep roots in America the book desires to discover how it is that America, alone among the nation of the book made the condemnation of nepotism a prime value, a value that has led to success and strength, including the meritocracy.<br /><br />A very interesting book, part history, part sociology.  The only flaw here is that it concentrates on a few examples and individuals, describing these peoples rise without giving context of the grander scheme of nepotism.<br /><br />Seth J.

However in general in 95% of all American public schools students are today taught that Paul Revere didn't do his ride, that Washington was a brutal slave owner in it for money, and that Jefferson was a hypocrite.  Every American revolutionary is described as greedy and wrong in their cause, every ideal is either hypocrisy or not true.  In general the line of teaching and thinking today is that the American revolution and the basis of the constitution and American values is all evil and bad and based on ulterior motives.<br /><br />This book is just continuing this anti-American theme of revising American history.  However this book pretends it is a lonely voice in the dark, but in general most of us already know what is being said her.  Most people are aware that the Native Americans joined the British side and were brutalized at wars end.  Most are aware that their were extremes and their was a racial aspect to the war and a class aspect and that it degenerated into a civil war so much so that Ben Franklins son joined the English.  Who is not aware of these things.  There is little new information here, accept perhaps a little bit more time spent explaining how perhaps it would have been better had American continued to be occupied by the British government and imperial Britain continued to tax Americans without representation and continue to force the church of England down every American throat and discriminate against Jews and other minorities.  American revolutionaries had many qualities to be admired, in some ways they were more progressive then politics today, their ideals were more utopian then ours, in the end American revolutionaries were people to be admired not spit upon the way this book does.<br /><br />Seth J.

Part of this book is about how facts and the media distort events, like the case of Mohamad al-Dura, however even in these investigations this book is sadly lacking.  We don't get a good look at the truth behind what happened in Jenin, how thousands of international reporters faked a 'massacre' that never happened, how the big elite media of the world and millions were deceived into believing thousands had died when 38 had actually been killed.<br /><br />Here we have a view of how Israeli society became 'uncivil' during the intifada.  After 2000 Israeli civilians were murdered between 2000-2004 the author is astounded to find that society has changed and people have dared to condemn and confront terrorism and Islamism. The author is horrified that Israelis became angry that they were being murdered every day.  This book shows shock that now its hard to visit Palestinian villages because suddenly their is hate between people.  This is simply an ignorant account of what happens when rich people who live in comfortable rich environments with their bourgeoisie friends are suddenly confronted with the reality.  Terrorism doesn't discriminate based on class or political ideology and perhaps that was the great shock of the story, that some rich Tel Aviv anti-Israeli academics found out they could also be victims of the type of Islamic and nationalist racist extremism among the certain parts of Palestinian society that they themselves had coddled for so long.<br /><br />In the end the society that became uncivil was also Palestinian society.  It also became hateful and angry.  This unbalanced account tries to pretend that only Israel reacted to the conflict and that only Israelis became 'uncivil'.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-08-19

The wiritng is superb, the characters are deep and portrayed well, the history however is deeply flawed.  The central theme of this book is that Milosevic conspired to steal land and in doing so launched a war that destroyed the Balkans.  We are told the Tudjman, Croatias Catholic president was his 'ally'.  THis is however not proven by the burden of history.  Tudjmans army rampaged through Bosnia and slaughtered and ethnically cleansed serbs as well as muslims.<br /><br />We are told here that the idea that the conflict was base don ehtnicity was a scam, which is interesting considering it was the west, like this author, who created the myth of ethnicity and 'ethnic cleansing' in the Balkans.  However it is true the conflict is not based solely on land, but rather the diverse nature of the region, with Catholics, Orthodox and Muslims and in this war it was as common for the catholics to be brutal to the orthodox christians as for eithe rto brutalize the muslims.<br /><br />This book presents a one sided story, a story where Serbs are portrayed not as people but animals and in this books attempt to dehumanize them we see the same ethnic hatred that the book claims doesnt exist.  If it was about land then why must this book only tell one side and pretend that half the party to this conflict were wilde beasts and not humans, thinking and breathing like others.<br /><br />As a tale and as a novella this ia masterful account.  it is not history and the judgements on the history of the region either lack understanding or are based on myth.<br /><br />Seth J.

Easter Island is known for its isolation and its statues, as well as its startling degree of population decline. Easter Island was discovered, forgotten and then rediscovered.  Its people originally arrived on canoes as part of the Polynesian expansion and colonization of the Pacific.  Originally the island was forested and may have sopported larger mammals and other beasts, however in short time the trees were cut down and only chickens, brought by the polynesians, remained.  The population embarked on the construction of the great stone statues, and then proceeded to fight endless wars.  The art of canoe building was forgotten.  When Europeans arrived diseases decimated the population untill few remained.  The few that did remain were interviewed about their naitonal myths but no information could be found on the giant stone structures, that the people then living seemed in no position to be able to create with the tools they had.<br /><br />A good book.<br /><br />Seth J.

It consists of three themes:<br /><br />1) America is an empire and is decidedly run as a crusader state trying impose its Christian liberal secular ideas on the world.<br /><br />2) Progress is relative.  Rather then progress, the world is `cyclical' and therefore nothing is ever right or wrong, peoples are different.  Civilizations are different.  Slavery is `bad' it is just a different way of organizing society.  Genocide isn't `bad' it is simply a different way of creating homogeneity.  We must never judge.<br /><br />3) Because of the above to `facts' America must never impose its ideas or will on anyone.<br /><br />This is quite clearly the line of thinking among those in the world who either a) oppose America, or (b) hate America.  This  includes parts of the academic elite  in the United States who due to their wealth and status doubt their nation out of a misguided view that everything their nation engages in is bad and when their nation is attacked then it deserves it.  Putting this behind us let us analyze why this view is simply incorrect.  The Moral Relativist mafia would have us believe that Islamic law is simply `relative' neither `backwards' or less `progressive' then secular law.  However under this logic Nazi law, and genocide and slavery are also simply `relative'  Who are we to judge the Nazis, after all the Nazis were a `civilization' and therefore who are we to impose our `progress' on Stalins Russia, Hitlers Germany or Saudi Arabia.  Under this logic western women would still not be allowed to vote, but lets leave that behind.  The logic that we must never label anything `progress' because we aren't allowed to judge may make sense.  However when another civilization, i.e. Islam, tries to impose its will on us through terrorism wouldn't the logic of one civilization not being allowed to impose its will on others kick in.  According to this study no.  This is not only wrong headed it is hypocritical.  Militant Islam wants to impose its will on our western society.  However we are not, according to this view, allowed to defend ourselves.  This book is a blueprint for terrorism, it gives those who want to murder westerners an excuse and it is a self hating literature if one is an American.<br /><br />Seth J.  Frantzmanl.

Colonialism is one of those topics that every western student is expected to have a knee jerk reaction of 'bad' when the word is mentioned.  Along with 'imperialism' this is the word used to condemn the west and justify murder and terrorism everywhere in the world.  From Hamas to the IRA to the Tammils, it is always generic 'colonialism' that is being fought against.  But how does colonialism come into play with nationalism?  What about the question of colonialism and the west.  What was colonialism?   <br /> <br />These definitions and debates are interesting, however in seeking a broader understanding and looking at 'colonial studies' this book doesn't address some important questions.  Most important this book accepts that 'colonialism' is a western creation when in fact it is not.  Since the 7th century Islam has colonized 1/5th of the world.  The Ottomans colonized Eastern Europe and the Afghans and Turks did the same to India.  China colonized Korea.  We have examples of colonial societies outside the west not usually recognized as such, in the pursuit of western academics to pursue their goal of self hate.  The Roman Empire and the Assyrian empires were colonial constructs.  Colonialism didn't start in 1492.  For instance for 1000 years, 500 of which took place before 1492, the Arabs colonized East Africa and deported 5 million slaves from the region.  They ran plantations and imported religion, in a similar model to the one applied by the Spanish in South America. <br /> <br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-07-27

Gibbon wrote his masterpiece in the 18th century at the time of the American revolution.  Clearly influenced by the ideals of the time, by the experiment of mass democracy in republican form, not tried since Rome and by new ideas of economics set out by Adam Smith as well as the ideals of the enlightenment, Gibbon penned his classic volumes on the fall of the Roman Empire.  Previous abridgements focused on the destruction of the western empire, this one follows the volumes through to the rise of the Church and the fall of the eastern empire.  Amazing sketches are given not only of the barbarian tribes of Europe but also of the Parthians, Ehtiopians, the old churches of Nestorians, diophysites and Monophsysites the Copts and of course the religion of Islam.  What is most fascinating here is the level of enlightenment of the author and exposes the lies that many in the west were taught, namely that t he west is intolerant and racist.  In fact Gibbon shows us through his beautiful language that perhaps not only were people more intelligent and insightful in 1776 but in his treatise on the rise of Islam and the life of Mohommed we get perhaps a more  insightful and tolerant but critical view then most will get today in an entire program of Islamic studies.  This illuminates two lies, first the lie that the west was narrow minded and self centered and ignorant until just recently when we embraced `diversity' and secondly that the modern view of Islam is not only not revolutionary, but that it is not modern.  Gibbon was perhaps more modern, more intelligent, and more dynamic with his sense of whit and reality then most scholars today, and certainly then most `accepted knowledge'  Much can be learned from this masterpiece, not only insights into church-state relations, taxation and warfare, but also the question of tyranny and the question of fanaticism, as well as how best a society can defend itself from enemies both outside and inside.<br /><br />The message of the forward to this abridgement is deeply flawed.  HANS-FRIEDRICH MUELLER, who did the abridgement remarks that many `born again' Americans will find the book `offensive' because the author questions the role of organized religion and faith.  This is patently untrue and shows the ignorance of the European abridger in his self centered and arrogant interpretation of the world.  We see that the same forward directs us to understand the message that Gibbon brings, the bigotry and incessant war and `empire' and apparently the power of the elite lead to the destruction of Rome.  Be warned this was not the message of Gibbon.  Rome guarded itself against barbarian invasions for more than a thousand years.  In its corruption it died, in the laziness and arrogance of its people it died.  In not having its own soldiers at the frontiers it died.  Gibbons message has nothing to do with America or with the American system, it has everything to do with why Europe has collapsed and is disappearing.<br /><br />Seth J.

We see that the same forward directs us to understand the message that Gibbon brings, the bigotry and incessant war and `empire' and apparently the power of the elite lead to the destruction of Rome.  Be warned this was not the message of Gibbon.  Rome guarded itself against barbarian invasions for more than a thousand years.  In its corruption it died, in the laziness and arrogance of its people it died.  In not having its own soldiers at the frontiers it died.  Gibbons message has nothing to do with America or with the American system, it has everything to do with why Europe has collapsed and is disappearing.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-07-23

A good book, one of many on Mr. Putin, this book is fair and it gives credit where it is due and dishes out criticism where it is due.

It covers every African nation in depth and focuses on all the important themes.  Beginning with independence it covers the struggle in Algeria, Ghana, and of course the famous 1960 year of independence.  it covers De Gaulle and the Suez Crises, moving south to survey the Belgian Congo and the Portuguese colonies.  Moving on it looks at the cold war struggle and the white minority regimes.  The book reminds us of the two million Europeans who once inhabited north Africa.<br /><br />Many forgotten episodes will be new to people.  This is simply a tour de force.  No stone is left unturned.  From the AIDS epidemic to the African dictatorships that looted their nations to the idealism or Senegal and Tanzania to the horrors of Idi Amin and Mugabe and 'elder' statement like Hastings Banda as well as crooks like Liberia's Taylor.  The civil conflicts in Katanga and Biafra are covered, as is the struggle against Apartheid.  No one will be left unhappy.  One does not need to be an African enthusiast to find interest here, a general interest in history and our modern world will suffice.  This book will help explain why year after year Africa gets poorer and deeper in debt and no matter the UN and the NGOs and the Aid organizations nothing is helping.  Although pessimistic, this is a fair, balanced and refreshingly honest account, both good history, reporting and writing in one volume.  There is surprisingly little judgment and politics here, simply an amazing familiarity with all the triumphs and tragedy of the last fifty years, from French human rights violations in Algeria to the theft of farms by Mugabe.<br /><br />Seth J.

The Nazi racial theory applied to Slavs led them to be used as slaves and treated as meat by the German conquerors.  Poland was treated a cow for milking, as hundreds of thousands of Germans entered Poland to administer and colonize it, it being the first nation to be 'liberated' for German 'labenstraum'.  Here we get a story of the 'holocaust' of the non-Jewish Poles and perhaps this is where the helpful aspect of this book collides with the its other bizarre appeal.  Many Holocaust deniers cite this book in order to prove that The Holocaust is being used to only show Jewish suffering while the 'real' holocaust of other non-Jews is covered up in histiography.  Hence the name 'Forgotten Holocaust\\".  However logically if the suffering of the Poles needs to be brough out of the dustbin of history and brought out alongside the Holocaust then why compare it to the Holocaust.  The suffering of the Poles is not a 'fogotten Holocaust' rather it is another massive war crime that should be addressed in history and presented alongside the holocaust to show that the Nazis target other groups for destruction, if not extermination.<br /><br />The Polish experience was different then the Jewish one.  Polich Jews were destroyed, Poles were slaughtered in large numbers.  However we have in the case of Poland a double tragedy when one realizes that hundreds of thousands of Poles were deported by the Communist Soviets between 1939 and 1941.  In the end POlish borders were moved westward while Soviet Ukraine and Beylorussia and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad took over swaths of eastern Poland.  Polish minorities such as the Germans were removed from Poland in 1945.  Much of the 1939-1945 Polish history remains to be uncovered, such as resistance units, and the uprising of the Home Army and the suppression by the Soviets.  This book begins down that path, however as a use to Holocaust deniers or those who want to see Jewish suffering relegated to the side it also presents a helpful tool, and that is tragic.<br /><br />Seth J.

First of all the setting is correct, America is the only super power and the world is threatened by terrorism and AIDs and gloibalizaiton is something that exists.  The prescription in this book is for America to 'lead' by cooperating and to 'fight poverty' and do lots of other do-gooder things in order to make others happy about globalization, perhaps 'solve' the AIDS problem and 'contain' dictators like Saddam.  We know from the thesis of \\"The Pentagons New Map\\" that the world is already divided into two spheres, one that 'works' and one that is disfunctional.  According to Huntingon the world is divided into 'civlizations'  This book only adds to these not mutually exclusive ideas by claiming that peaceful solutions can be found to problems and that America can use its influence, economic and political, to make others agree.<br /><br />First of all, America is the new empire.  Cooperation doesnt work.  First of all, most of Europe positions itself as being 'anti-america'.  Second, Americas true ally, India, has gets little attention here.  The author, of course, denies that the main source of the worlds problems are found in that long belt that includes North Africa, the Middle East and Cnetral Asia, namely Muslim nations and those that border them.  The Democracy problem was solved  in South America, it yearns to be solved in the Middle East however this book provides no clear solutions.  Cooperation couldnt stop the Rwandan genoicde and it will do nothing to stop AIDS so long as African cultures deny it sexists, therefore cooperation is a dead letter.  America, unfortunatly, must go it alone, and those who choose to follow will be rich and happy, those who dont will be poor and undemocratic.<br /><br />Besides its only a matter of time before the world ceases to be unipolar.<br /><br />Seth Frantzman	2005-07-02

Basically John Brown was an extremist, in his christian inspiration he saw Slavery as a stain that had to be whiped out through blood.  Instead of waiting for the government to act, like other fanatics(such as Peta or anti-abortion activists) he used violence to acheive his goal.  Brown was a romantic figure in some way, he use da sword to kill people, he fought a guerilla war in Kansas, he raided the south, he stole horses, something of an AMerican Pancho Villa, accept his vause was sopposedly idealistic, despite the blood he spilled.  This book is an apologist account, but it is one that is being used to make up for the slander and anti-John Brown books that have been written.  Some have seen this book as a northern conspiracy to justify the murder of white southerners, this is not the correct conclusion, rather this book seeks to change the slant of history towards John Brown, not simply to make the slant more 'nothern' but simply to make it more pro-Brown, and if this is a 'northern' agenda then it perhaps shows how far the nation has not come since 1861.<br /><br />In the end John Brown challenged the government and a Southerner, Robert E. Lee, led the elite soldiers that brought the American terrorist to justice.  John Brown wasnt the first AMerican guerilla or revolutionary, but his idealism and his acts deserve attention for it shows the quiet waters of idealism and violence that led men to great and terribe deeds in the 19th century.<br /><br />Seth J.

He embraced the cause of Jewish self defense, leading the JDL and coining the phrase \\"every Jew a .22\\".  He went on to fight the Soviet suppression of Jews and then did Aliyah to Israel where he quickly became infamous for his ideas and speeches regarding the demographic problem and his calls in \\"They Must Go\\" for a volunary expulsion of Arabs.

The middle east is unpredictable and beggining there we might question why it is important to write a tentative biography of someone who hasnt done much.  First of it should be said it is important to have a new book on Syria as Patrick Seales are outdated.  Asad is dead(the elder), Syria is out of Lebanon.  These are major changes for the Alewite 'secular' government in Demscus.  Russia is out of the picture militarily, the Americans are on the border, the nation is isolated.  Kurds demand rights.  Where to house the x-lebanese Syrian settlers who have returned(300,000 by some estimates).<br /><br />However the book does repeat some idiotic storias about Israel.<br /><br />There is a theory presented that Israelis dont want 'peace'.  But peace is a misleading term.  What the author means is Israel apparnetly doesnt want the Syrian version of peace and 'justice'.  The authors suspect comment that Israel is 'racist' is also interesting in light of his non-mentioning of the horrors visited upon Muslim fundamentalists in Homs in the 1980s when Asad the elder killed tens of thousands of them.  Presumably the message is clear, when dictatorships repress people, including Christian minorities, thats no big deal, any human rights abuses are acceptable if dictatorships commit, and of course a Muslim cannot be 'racist' since that term is only reserved for liberal democracies such as Israel.  Highly controversial statements such as these should have been left out of what is otherwise a dry, but honest and updated text.<br /><br />Bashar Asad is interesting.  Syria is a fascinating nation with many minorities including the Alewites who govern, the Kurds, Druze, SYriac CHristians and Armenains as well as a few Turks and Circassians no one will tell anyone about.  Syria is also in dnager today, no longer the military behomoth it was in the 1970s.

The European 'dream' is 'superior' and America is lagging behind.  This extends to working hours, productivity and technology as well as othe issues.<br /><br />Let us ask if this is correct. A Survey of the 500 richest americans will find fully 19% never had college eduations and less than 10% had inherited wealth.  What will a similar survey show in Europe? It will show that 90% of the Richest europeans were born  rich and groomed by the elite for wealth.  Europe is still a society of old money and class, where people are expected to remain in their station and not try to move up.  In America however a recent immigrant can found his own business and send his children to Harvard.  How many of the richest europeans are recent immigrants?<br /><br />Europe is not the hope for the future, but rather a window onto a ding civilization.  Declining birth rates, self hate, and the mass conversion ot Islam will make Europe a nation of Theological fundamentalists.  The author points to Europes 'secualrism'  however just recently European nations are passing anti-blasphemy laws in order to appease militant Islam.  In Europe the state funds religion and in many cases the state funded religion is extremist in outlook.  This is Europe, a civilization that no longer clings to any western values.  Democracy in EUrope is the showpeice of the elite. Europe has a terrible human rights record.  Europeans allowed the rwandan genocide.<br /><br />Europeans go throughout the world telling others, especially Africans how to beahve in the new imperialsim of 'charity work'.  However the era of Europe is over.  Western Europe imports teenage protsitutes from Eastern Europe.  This is Europe, a land of religious extremism where the laws of the church are being reapplied and soon it will be illegal to curse god.<br /><br />Not a model, but a throwback, reactionary tragedy.<br /><br />Seth J.

It is about what the west produces, namely models, who only want to degrade themselves.  Let us begin with the cover.  A degrading picture of a western woman.  It is all she has learned, the west offered her freedom to choose her life, it gave her possibilities, it didnt forcibly put a burka on her.  And this is the result, degredation masquerading as scholarship.  Some parts of this book may intirgue and titilate and keep the reader interested, some parts try to show how the west is influencing China.  but let us recall who is telling the story?  A self hating western woman who sees only other cultures, hates her own, and yearns to be scnatilly clad in another culture to attract foreign men.  Not a suprise that the people profiled in this book, one is involved in threesomes, and the other two are abject racists, refusing to date their own people and 'only' dating those from another race, a program that  is an insidious and sad as it is to be a racist and only date ones own.  To judge based on race is wrong, and tragically it is all the westerner has learned.  In an attempt to appreciate other cultures all the west does is obsess over them, self hating, never judging, and in doing so judging.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-06-19

In 1941 when the Nazis had overun all of Europe and the Japanese tried to take over Asia, America dared to be an evil imperialist by opposing Nazism, after all Nazism was actually 'anti-colonial'.<br /><br />When the Russians took over Eastern Europe and ensalved their own people and those of 15 other nations America dared to stand up for its imperial interests and defend Europe and the world.  Instead America should have done nothing and let the world all end up like North Korea so that every nation can end up like cambodia where 1/3 of the population is killed and 1/3 put in a Gulag.<br /><br />In the 2000s when Militant Islam went on a rampage in Europe, in Nigeria, the Phillipines, Indonesia, Thailand, Sudan, Israel and India, slaughtering innocents, America dared to retaliate when 3000 of its citizens were killed.<br /><br />This is the empire of America.  The WTO and IMF bail out starving nations, helps build dams and infrastructure and that is bad.  Yes America is an empire and if these are the sins America is accused of then America must keep going full steam ahead, and keep opposing religious fundamentalism, Nazism and th enslavement of the world.<br /><br />Seth J.

She watches as her mother is stripped of a job and forced to donn religious idicoy to go about outside.  It ends with her going to Europe.  Now we learn what Europe had in stall for her, namely drugs, homosexuality(not her), sex, dating, liberalism, all those things that Iran was stripped of.  So we follow her back to Iran, back to enforced Relgiouns clothing, back to a society created by the Left, a society where women are unequal, where religious fascism is the staple and where her ever reverent comic style can be once again put to good use to educate and enthrall the audience about the evils of Religiousity forced upon society.<br /><br />What we see here is something more however, read between the lines this book says something deeper, namely that the same problems that enslave Iran, enslave Europe.  In Europe young women turn to prostitution, drug use and sexually explicit clothing as a way to enslave themselves to modern society and men who have no honor.  In Iran the smae enslavement is forced upon women by the government, in reverse order, the men are immoral, and women are closeted in Purdah.  We see here the irony.  In the free society(Europe) women throw away their earned freedoms in search of fulfilling mens sexual needs and their own psychiatric self hate.  In Iran women were forced to throw away their freedom by a liberally supported Islamic revolution.<br /><br />Which is better?  We are not left with a clear answer, however the obvious one is that in a none religious society people may choose their own path, rather then have their clothing mandated by the government.  This is a riveting account and a deep person will come to understand the choice facing the world and the choice facing the west in particular.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-06-18

The disappearence of the Aral sea is mostly an environmentalists wet dream, it is the stuff of legend of hyperventalating protestors.  The Aral sea is in fact, not disappearing.  The Aral sea is shrinking, like the Dead Sea.  This is a problem.  However it will not be gone by 2020 and it is not the 'worlds worst ecological catastrophe'.<br /><br />Second Mr. Ferguson, the author didnt stop this problem, he got caught up in politics and accused of murder.  This book does not just document the issue of the Aral sea, it also documents the politics and 'culture' of central Asia.  The author, who was an appologist for communism in the 1980s todays explains wrongly how the Central Asian republics were created and their nations deliniated by evil Russian 'imperialists' who artificially divided it into five states.  This is simply not true.  The lines on the map may be artificial but the peoples are not.  The Tajiks speak Persian.  The Kyrguz are related to the Xigurs of China.  The Kazakhs and Uzbeks and Turkmen are closely related cousin tribes.  Before Russia arrived they all had states and wondering nomadic peoples attached to them.  Russia helped give them an alphabet and allow them to create their own literary culture and homogenize traditions.  Islam had already colonized these peoples, they were merely re-occupied.  Now they have made up for independence by ignoring the destruction of their environment.  This is where the book detours again.  The book blames russia for the Aral sea problems.  However it was Uzbek leadership who, during the Soviet period, destroyed and exploited their autonomous country.  In the independent period, which has now gone on for 15 years the book pretends how these nations cant take any responsibility for it, as if they are just helpless cultural artifacts.  However for the past 15 years they have plundered the Aral sea.<br /><br />This book is sad hogwash, perhaps good as adventure writing.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzmanr /> <br />Seth J.

The premise is quite simple.  Jews are a tiny conspiratorial minority.  They control banking, media, money, and other things.  They use these things to wield intellectual power, to dominate nations, to force the west to conform to their values, and eventually they use their power in the government to swamp the `host' nation with immigrants and plunge the `host' nation into war with foreign nations either (A) to weaken the `host' nation or (B) to help Israel and Jewish interests.<br /><br />What are the problems with this line of reasoning?  First of all it is true that Jews appear to be disproportionately represented in certain professions, music, media, banking as examples.  But the author doesn't ask why?  Jews gravitated to these professions because they were forbidden others, just as African Americans succeed in sports and music, so the Jews likewise succeed in places they can.  Do Jews `critique' the `host' nation.  Yes, Jews turned out to be part of university and intellectual life and Jews certainly worked to create Human Rights and lead nations to give more rights to minorities, since Jews saw in other minority's reflections of themselves.  However Jews were equally represented on both sides of the debate.  The U.S is a good example.  Jews are both intellectual powerhouses of Liberalism and of Conservatives.  Jews are on both sides of economics, from the most radical capitalists to the greatest communists.  Jews supported Mussolini and were persecuted by him.  Jews funded Franco and Jews served in the international brigades to oppose him.  More than 100,000 Jews died for Imperial Germany, some killing fellow Jews in the other `host' nations of France and England.  If Jews are in fact the leaders of a culture of `critique' they do so against one another as much as against the host country which is why one finds so many anti-Israeli Jewish academics and self hating Jews.  Likewise if it true Jews conspire to bring in minorities then why did Germany flood itself with Muslim immigrants after the Holocaust, Jews have had no part in Europe's own immigrant invasion.  In the 1960s the racists argued Jews were conspiring to bring blacks to the north to create a race war, however those same blacks Jews helped in the civil rights movement are today the leading anti-Semites.<br /><br />This book is shod scholarship and although its no Mien Kampf, its racial theories are not far from it.<br /><br />Seth J.

In Muslim countries, even those pretending to be 'secular' anyone who dares to convert to a non-Islamic religion is persecuted and in many cases imprisoned.  In Muslim countries such as Malaysia and Pakistan, this 'religion of peace' has made it illegal for a Muslim to be converted to another religion.  These are true stories of what it is like to live in these societies, from real people who experienced this persecution.  The message is clear, we must open our eyes to the truth going on in the Islamic world, and to a culture that is in opposition to all those values of the rest of the world.  This is not about Jesus, this is not about how wonderful Christianity is, rather it is about tolerance.  In Western Universities students are propogandized about the 'tolerance' of Islam and the 'protection of the peoples of the book'.  In The West Students are encouraged to convert to Islam, and every major Western college such as Oxford of Harvard has million dollar muslim endowments for the spread of Islam among the students in the guise of 'education'.

Millions of Rajput Hindu slaves were deported, enough that the Gypsies found their way to Europe in this manner.<br /><br />This book tells the story of the people enslaved by the Barbary pirates in the 17th-19th centuries until their evils were put asunder by the great U.S Navy when Jefferson declared that the world had had enough.<br /><br />This book is about barbarism, it is about slavery, and it is about opening the doors on the slave trade by Muslims of non-muslims, a trade which still goes on in the Gulf State and Saudi Arabia as well as Sudan and Niger.  A slave trade aided, abbetted and covered up by western liberals.  This book is a must read, if not for the harrowing account then to enlighten about a part of history that will never be taught in school, since it invovles daring to expose the 'religion of peace'.<br /><br />Seth J.

In the first in a long line of appologist leftists he is the prophet, the prophet of the lefts tryst with destiny, whereby the left jettisons all of its loyalty to ideas like equality and defense of minorites and instead embraces totalitarian theological fascism.  Foucault was the first and it is important for english language readers to digest the magnitude of his infatuation.  Foucault concluded in 1978 that the Shah was '100 years behind the times'. In a sense he was correct, these ideas that men and women are equal, that minorites should have rights, that gays should have rights, that nations should not be run by religion, they are indeed old hat, they were indeed products of that thing called the enlightenment, something that led scholars such as Twain and Jefferson to doubt the viinity of Jesus, and dare to ask if perhaps a state should not be run by religion fundamentalists.<br /><br />Today we live in the Foucault world.  The world where extremist fascism is aided and abetted by leftist appollogy, where the left is supporting the Burka, the Abbaya, the Chador, the Purdha, the virtual disappearence of women from society, where the modern west should be sold down the reiver to theocratic slavery so that every person can be equal in poverty.  Foucault rejected Marxism and in Islamism he saw the answer to the worlds problems.  In the millions the Iranian Revolution murdered, in the democracy it slaughtered, he saw the answer.  Not a suprise given that we has brought up by the same left that denied the existence of Stalin's Gulag.  The fact that he doubted the enlightenment is not a suprise given that everything to him in the West was evil.<br /><br />Foucault never bothered to confront himself on this one lie.  He never bothers to ask 'am not I a product of the West, is not my self hate a product of being a westerner?'.  Leftists everywhere yearn for the Caliphate, Foucault was the first.<br /><br />Seth J.

This book builds on others such as 'State of Nations', 'Vieled Empire' and 'Affirmitive Action Empire' to explain how Soviet ethnographers tried to shape the new Russian state.  Several themes were common.  The Soviets were devout anti-imperialists, and the Russian people as a distinctive state ceased to exist after they attained power, in place of the U.S.S.R became a state of 'nations' whereby different ethnic minorities not only were preferred in the state but new nations were created.<br /><br />The second theme is that of Russia as an 'Empire'.  Recent scholarship shows how Russia used 'colonial methods' to extrapolate and study and compile census's of the peoples that inhabited russia.  The problem with this line of reasoning is two fold.  First it is unequivacally a fact that Russia raised the awareness of the peoples they encountered, bringing them alphabets and encoruaging native literature.  At the same time it is not neccesarily 'colonial' to want to census the people that live in your country.  However the theory is that all this understanding ethnicity work had colonial overtones.<br /><br />Leaving this behind this is a fascinating, illuminating and wonderful work that opens a door unto the multitude of peoples that inhabited soviet Russia.  In many places where a people existed that had no boundaries, no written language and no schalarly culture the Soviets created local elites, education systems and drew boundaries where the minority would be a majority.<br /><br />Russia became an 'empire of nations' in this manner.  Mostly the book looks at the first 20 years of Soviet rule, from 1917 when Soviet forces enlisted minorities in the fight against the Whites through to Stalins encouragement of diversity.  In the end the programs were abandoned to some degree in the late 1930s as the build up to WWII began, in the aftermath corrupt elites built on this system, creating nationalism, discriminating against ethnic russians and in many cases creating national awareness where non existed before.  A good book.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzmantem, creating nationalism, discriminating against ethnic russians and in many cases creating national awareness where non existed before.

A whirlwind tour of American history that draws many conclusions and traces many cultural attributes to formerly unjunjectured connections this book is a happy addition to the literature on where Black culture came from, who is responsible for the baseness of U.S culture in the underclass, and why 'white liberals' are not helping the matter by encouraging retrograde behavior and fake history and sladered pride.<br /><br />An important critique, showing that it is important to challenge received stereotypes and question received 'facts'.  A controversial books whose conclusions may not be accurate, but are nonetheless important to spark new debate.  The book is not only about Black Culture it is also about poor white culture, about american ethnicity and about the ghettozation of U.S cities, as well as an important remmemberance that it was Western Civilization that ended slavery, forcing Islamic nations to stop importing slaves in the 1840s-1880s.<br /><br />Seth J.

The history of Irans work the bomb dates back to the 1980s, or maybe the 1970s.  The overthrow of the Shah ushered in a reprehensible regime that forcibly imposed morality and modesty on women(the Chador) and removed rights of minorities and others.  Immediatly upon assuming powere however the regime was plunged into a terrible war with Iraq where millions of Iranians, including child soldiers were enlisted and gassed in battle by Saddam.  The regime purged the communist, liberal and democratic elemnets as an excuse to win the war.<br /><br />The nuclear program was covert and extensive in the 1990s and no one noticed.  In the the first years of 2000 the program progressed.  However unlike Iraq where the nukes were stored only at Orsirak the Iranians spread their program out, fearing Israeli or American attacks.<br /><br />Iran supports terror the world over through its proxy Hizbollah in Lebanon among others.  Ironically it also supported Armenians against Azerbaijan in order to not enliven Azeri claims for autonomy in the Persian state.  Today after dealing with Iraw, America faces Iran.  Iran has pretended to reform, however it continues to build the nukes.  This book presents a good view of the showdown to come.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-06-18

However there is a major setback in this research.  First of all it doesnt ask the question if any of the stereotyping is based on experience.  It assumes all stereotyping is illogical.  But what is a stereotype and why is it 'bad'?  A stereotype is a beleif of a virtue about a certain group of people based on name or visual association.  Let us recall that in Israel of 2153 Israeli civilian deaths by terror since the year 2000, 100% have been caused by arabs using terrorism.  Does this make the stereotype of arabs as terrorists logical.  According to the authors no.  According to the authors one must never stereotype and the fact that a child who has seen his mother stabbed by a terrorist dares to draw a picture showing that terrorists as an arab makes the child racist.  The theory of this book is that every Israeli is racist, a stereotype unto itself ironically.<br /><br />The second setback of this book is that it, of course, ignores the arab stereotypes of Israel.  Their are 5 million Israelis and 250 million Arabs.  Every Arab also has stereotypes that lend themselves to continuing the conflict.  However we dont see the arabs brought in for criticism here.  This book is basically a racist text, it argues that based on someone being a Jew they are racist agianst arabs, that every Jew is born hating and that every Jew in Israel is indoctrinated to hate.<br /><br />The authors never bothered to ask ther question:  were not the suicide bombers also stereotyping the Israelis they kill?  Does the terrorism create stereotyping?  Does the terrorism also lead to continuation of the conflict.  The authors are self haters who want to convince the world that Israel, their country, is evil.  A sad commentary, a lesson unto itself of stereotyping.<br /><br />Seth J.

The area covered is the steppe lands from Mongolia to the former soviet republics(Kazakhstan, Uzbek, Tajik, Turkmen and Kyrgiz) as well as the Sinkiang(Xinxiang/Uiguer) province of China.  It covers with wonderful fluid writing the history from the original linguistic families of Turkic speaking tribesmen to the arrival of Islam.  We see how the people were once Buddhist and how Arabic script colonized them only to be repalced by Cyrillic in modern times.  We are told of the the story of the Kok Turks, and CHinese expansion into Inner and outer mongolia.  Various dynasties are covered, including Persian influence and the lands of Bokhara and Khiva.  The arrival of the Mongols is explained and the decline through to Soviet expansion<br /><br />Most fascinating is the account brings us up to the modern day, explaining the Communist state of Mongolia and the Sovietization of Central Asia, including the various autonomous 'nations' the Soviets created for groups like the Bakshir nomads and other peoples of the Steppe, preserving, creating and in come cases fragmenting culture.<br /><br />The soviets even impressed language onto peoples, such as the Uzbeks, giving alphabets and coercing natives.  Modern times has seen war, famine, dictatorship, Chinese encroachment, Suppression, and of course Islamization of the region.

Inner or Central Asia, the land of the Steppe peoples has produced countless massive migrations of peoples and an ehtnic and linguistic patchwork stretching from China to Turkey and beyond.  An area that comprises Muslims and Buddhists, that was home to the Huns, Genghis Kahn and the Turks, it is fascinating history of a part of the world that few realize is important.<br /><br />The Huns appeared in Europe in the 2nd century CE.  Alexander the Great was in the area in the 5th century BCE.  The land of the steppes, stretching from Mongolia to central asia, through tot he Caucuses is an immense land.  Conquered by Genghis Kahn, it was ruled by the ancestors of these hordes for hundreds of years.  The hordes disintegrated leaving remnants as distant as India.  However we see also the Turkic influence on the languages not only of the Xuiguers of China's Xinxiang province but also in the Azeria, Uzbeks and Kazahks.<br /><br />The Steppes provided a land for Buddhism and Islam as both religions spread through it.  Yet we also see Marco Polos journey.  This is history on a grand scale, told throuhg conjecture, and eye witness account.  it explains culture and vast military conquest, as well as linguistic and archeological evidence.  In short this is THE text for the region.  It explains the impact on the civilizations of the Persians, Islam and Europe as well as China, Russia and Japan.  In Short the heart of the world is the steppe peoples and the regions once ability to produce massive waves of barbarian migrations led not only to the collapse of the Roman empire, but the ethnic and linguistic changes that causes Germany to speak German and the Muslim Ummayid empire to collapse.  The horsemen of central asia figured in Tamerlane and Alexanders worlds.  They also lived on in their special cultural societies into modern times.

A short easy, consice, and pleasent read not full of polemics or bias.  It covers the main actors involved, the struggle and the outcome.  The Lebanese Civil war began in 1976 with the attempted assasination of Pierre Gemayel, a Lebanese Christian leader.  In retaliation a cycle of violence broke out originally between Phalange militias and PLO elements, widening into a costly wider war, that dragged in all communities eventually dividing the nation between christian and Muslim.  In the ensuing violence and massacres more than 100,000 may have been killed.  The Syrians intervened in the first year and in 1982 so did the Israelis.<br /><br />After the Israeli withdrawel from Beirut Lebanon became a Syrian colony accept for the south which was jointly contested by israel and Shia Islamists, and the north which was largely given over to the Maronites.

This book fills an important gap.  Most are fimiliar with Israel through the headlines, \\"checkpoints\\", \\"palestinians\\", \\"terrorism\\".  But there is another Israel.  There is the idealistic land and people who came from more than 100 countries, many with nothing, and built a first world nation.  They built an ideal society, with kibbutzim, communal owned property where new farming techniques were created.  They came to the forefront in technology and science.  An innovative nation, Israel should be a model for the world.  In Israel women and men serve together in the army, race in the western sense of the word does not exist, as millions of immigrants from disparate places such as the Soviet Union(former) and Ethiopians mingle in society.<br /><br />Israel is a nation of people who live in small houses, where society is fluid, where orthodox religion coexists next to the nude beahces of Ashdod.  A state that has pioneered exonomic and environmental programs.<br /><br />This book is a wonderful study, a fascinating look at a new country and its role in the world, and its gifts to the world.  Many things will intrigue, and this is not a book of politics, this is a book about achievment, about revolutionary ideals.<br /><br />A good eye opener, away from the polemic driven press that frequents the middle east all to often.<br /><br />Seth J.

It also delves into 'lesser' 'genocides' in Bosnia and the \\"U.S Mexico border region\\".  It is these dichotomies that make the book problematic.  First, the introductions explain different categories of genocide. Then there is a rundown of genocides of 'indegenous' or 'first' peoples.  These are well known or not, depending on ones backround.  The native american genocides in the Americas are covered as is the genocide of the Herero people, and the Armenians.  Also mentioned are assaults on native peoples in South East Asia and India, as well as the Sudan and Australia.<br /><br />However some major assaults on people go unnoticed.  For instance the ethnic cleansing of Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan in 1948, the killing of more than 250,000 Chinese by Indonesia, and of course East Timor.  Genocide is selective, not in its fact, but in how the west perceives it.  Certain conflicts are not called 'genocide' becuase of Political correctness. For instance the mass slaughter of Assyrians in 1920s Iraq is not mentioned.<br /><br />This is where the book breaks down.  Wonderful chapters deal with post genoicde and trauma and memory in such places as post war Germany.  However the foolishness that one article labels the American-Mexico border a 'potential' genoice or a place where 'genocide' terms ar eused is pure nonsense.  IF this is true of the border area, then it is true of every nation in the world, and that downplays the seriousness of actual genocides like the Holocaust.  if the Holocaust is 'like' the Mexican-American border region, then 'genocide' means nothing.<br /><br />The Bosnian case is also suspect.  Most now confirm that the 'genocide' that took place, involved perhaps 2000 civilians.  ANd of course the war and the 'ethnic cleansing' terms were political aimed only at Serbs, ignoring Croat and Bosnian and Kosovar atrocities.  Genocide is not war, and this is where one writer is very mistaken.  failed Attempts, or thoughts of genocide, are not genocide.

It is repeated like a mantra, every student of Jewish history or of Islamic studies must learn it and repeat it, until it becomes myth.  This excellent study is one of the few to challenge this dominat view.  Today academics encourage the propoganda that Islam is 'more tolerant' than Christianity.  However here we are given a small taste of that 'tolerance'.  Dhimmi is a word meaning 'protected'.  However just as the Nazis created concentration camps to 'protect' the Jews the word itself can be used in many ways.  This book analyzes the experience of Jews in Muslim lands.  Some have accused this work of 'only' concentrating on the negative aspects of Muslim-Jewish relations, however this is just the point, a litany of works have focused on this subject in Europe, it time that the dust be taken from the truth about Islamic nations.<br /><br />Partly the problem rests on lack of sources and literature, this book begins to fill this essential gap.<br /><br />A second way to analyze the question of which Jews were 'better off' is to see the end result.  If Muslim lands were 'better' to the Jews then why did the Jews of Europe become free and wealthy?  Why were there more Jews in Europe than muslim lands despite persecution, endless forced conversion and murder due to claims that Jews created the black death?  Jews numbered 12 million in Christian lands while they numbered only a million in Muslim ones in 1930.  By 1945 the numbers were 6 million and 1 million.  By 1967 the numbers were 8 million and 50,000.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-05-30

Despite its unique title, it is a history not only of the Churches of the Holy Land but Christian life under Muslim and Jewish rule, as well as the short period of the Mandate 1918-1948.  Arab Christians have suffered to be sure under all three.  These Christians were the originals, those who converted at the time of Jesus and after.  Under the crusades they had mixed loyalties, fearing what would happen when the Muslims won.  Under Muslim rule they were Dhimmi, they fought amongst each other, competed for great power allegiance and had to suffer discrimination and the rampant disrespect of their churches.  Under Jewish rule the community has suffered from inter-marriage and a lower birth rate than other Arabs as well as the tragedy of out-migration, which is threatening the community's very existence.  Despite alliance on the West Bank with Fatah, Christians are still harassed and persecuted in quiet ways, and through laws that discriminate such as the Palestinian law whereby a child is the religion of the father.<br /><br />Under Jordanian rule Christians were forced to learn the Koran in school.  Under Israel they are suspected of dual loyalties.<br /><br />A marvelous account.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantmzan	2005-05-30

General Parma's troops were massed in the Netherlands to be floated across the channel under the tutelage of the massive Armada made up of Caravels and even Triremes.  The Armada was paid for by the Churchs gold, it was to be a crusade.  England was a provincial backwater, not yet a sea power, and Elizabeth an untested queen, her captains like Sir Francis Drake were pirates. However the Armada failed.  It fell into issues in the Channel, the weather was bad, it blew out to sea, foundered in Ireland(where later Eamon De Velera was a descendant of Catholic shipwrecked Spaniards).  Elizabeth and her interesting assortment of naval commanders were made heroes.  England gained a defining moment that would be replayed when she faced down both Napoleon and then Hitler across the same Channel and was miraculously saved both times.  Protestant Europe survived and as we know much of the world was altered by the victory.<br /><br />The author is an expert on Maritime studies and specializes in privateering and naval warfare.

The answer, not found in this book, it is not.  Jerusalem was claimed by the Jews to be a place where Isaac was not sacrificed by Abraham.  However this was pure revisionism from the beginning, since by the time David founded his city in Jerusalem, no one knew.  David did build Jerusalem, and two temples did rest above his city.  Herod did built the monstrous temple mount that exists today.  Jesus was crucified in or near Jerusalem.  Mohammed never saw Jerusalem, he referenced 'the holy' which was not Jerusalem but became Jerusalem when it was conquered.  On the temple mount the Muslims found a rock, and claimed Mohammed's footprint was in it.  As illogical as the same rock being where Isaac and Abraham were, this shows how a once faked holy site is then doubly faked.  Pagans faked its holiness to.  They built a temple atop the mount.  The city is holy, no doubt, but the historical facts attributed to it are bogus.  Persecution followed, of Jews by Christians and then of Christians by Muslims.  In 1948 the city divided, Christian students in the city were forced to learn Koran half the day and Jews were forbidden to enter.  1967 liberated the city, for all faiths, despite the authors opinion that it would be better for intolerance to have triumphed and only one religion be allowed sovereignty.<br /><br />This is a sad disingenuous tale, which does not remark on the idiocy of the very idea of a city being 'holy' to three faiths.  Maybe it is holy to the world?  Maybe the Buddha was in Jerusalem.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-05-29

Without the Arabic beside the English it has a slight drawback, however the index more than makes up for any problems, making it easy to search for your favorite subject, may it be slavery, war, or Jihad.  Some references are obscure and without commentary some things are left unknown, despite several helpful footnotes.  If one is interested in a fair and good translation in English, without bias, and not printed on behalf of an Islamist government, this is the pick.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-05-29

Books	5	7	13	N	N	A good start	This wonderful book helps the Christian and non-Christian reader understand where the two theologies differ and why the doctrin of the trinity is not what Muslims say it is.  THis book concentrates on theology and the different affirmations fo God according to the two faiths, for one it is submission, for the other love.  The author does a wonderful job and introducing the reader to these tough subjects and making sense of questions of sin and forgiveness.<br /><br />Probably the only issue here is that the central theme of the book is not answered fully.  A textual comparison has never been done of the New Testament verus the Koran and this is lacking.  How is it possible the 'Father of Jesus' who said 'turn the other cheek' be the same god who ordered Mohammed to kill all the pagans in the world?  In essence, becuase the history and the context is in the way and because religion by its nature is based on faith/not logic, we are not dealing here with an answer but an anecdote.<br /><br />Seth J. frantzman	2005-05-29

The Armada was created by Phillip II in 1588 with the hopes of bringing the Catholic church back to England by the Sword.  General Parma's troops were massed in the Netherlands to be floated across the channel under the tutelage of the massive Armada made up of Caravels and even Triremes.  The Armada was paid for by the Pope's Gold, it was to be a great crusade.  England was a backwater to some extant, and Elizabeth an untested queen, her captains like Sir Francis Drake were pirates. However the Armada failed.  It fell into issues in the Channel, the weather was bad, it blew out to sea, foundered in Ireland(where later Eamon De Velera was a descendant of Catholic shipwrecked Spaniards).  Elizabeth and her interesting assortment of naval commanders were made heroes.  England gained a defining moment that would be replayed when she faced down both Napoleon and then Hitler across the same Channel and was miraculously saved both times.<br /><br />This book retells this famous story, with whit, wisdom and in a handsomely written style.  However there is one glaring problem, the need by the author to slander and revise the story of Elizabeth.  Instead of the Gallant queen who claims `I know I have but the body of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart of a king'  we are given the portrait of a selfish woman who cares only for herself, who allowed here naval seamen to starve to death after the battle and who gives no such speech.  The sources for this are dubious and the revisionism is not fair to such an extraordinary women.  However if true, perhaps the allegations force us to reconsider our views.<br /><br />Seth J.

For hundreds of years, reacting to persecution of pilgrims in the Holy Land, Christian Armies ravaged Europe, the Byzantine Empire, Egypt, and the Holy Land.  They captured Jerusalem, and held the land for a hundred years.  They erected many castles and played out a romantic drama between the legendary King Richard II and Saladin.<br /><br />Today the Crusades is used by political opportunists to claim that `the roots of the problems of the middle east are the crusades'.  It is a nice idea and it fits in with the modern day Western view that everything wrong with the world must be the West's fault.<br /><br />However when we deal with the Crusades we must realize that it is memory and obsession that keeps them alive, not the reality of the endeavor.  The Crusaders had only a few hundred knights in the Holy Land.  They paid for their laborers, unlike the Muslims who used slaves.  They were intolerant, but they were confronting intolerance, they were from a different period.  They were confronting Islamic Crusading that had brought Islam to the gates of Paris, and Constantinople.  The roots of the middle east conflict are not in the crusades, it is a moronic theory, rather the roots of the conflict are in the geographical location of the Holy Land, and the tragic fact that the worlds largest religions inherited a claim to that land from the small tribe of Jews who settled it so long ago with their One God.  This is the root, not the battle at Hattin, or the Siege of Jerusalem in 1099.  The Crusades are an excuse.  It is as if American terrorists were attacking England claiming that they ahd to make up for the wrongs of the revolutionary war.  Pope Urban IIs call for the crusades was akin to Mohammed call to his followers to take over the world.  One must put themselves at the time to understand it.  To graft modern issues onto the past is foolish, and excuses like these only work so long as people believe them.  The root of WWII was at Munich, the root of the middle east conflict has nothing to do with what happened long ago.<br /><br />Seth J.

Singapore, Burma, India.  The Japanest struck swiftly and desicively, capturing Singapore in record time and sinking two of Englands greatest warships.  The war as it developed in the jungles of Southeast Asia employed many fascinating characters and peoples.  The Japanest claimed they were creating a 'co-prosperity' sphere where Asians would work together towards the common future.  However the truth of the matter is more complicated.  Despite the Japanese claim that imperialism was 'racist' the Japanese turned out to be as imperialistic and as condescending as Europeans had been, as they stripped countries of natural resources to feed their ambitions.<br /><br />The British employed many Indian troops and other native troops to stem the Japanese tied.  Recovering from the loss of Singapore, the defeats of the Dutch in Indonesia and the threat to both India and Australia the English waged an unending guerilla war in Burma, made famous not only by 'Bridge on the river Kwai' but also by the Chindits and Orde Wingates irregulars.<br /><br />This is an excellent panorama, employing whit, history and stories of the characters and cultures bisected by the war.

Not only is there Operation Bluestar and the Punjab crises, but also the problems in Sri Lanka, Kashmir and of course the rise of the BJP.  This book begins with this backdrop to trace the rise and governance of Rajiv Gandhi, Indira Gandhi's son.  His brother Sanjay was killed in a plane crash and Rajiv, by all accounts a mild mannered man, assumed the helm of the worlds greatest democracy.  He did so against a back drop of communalism and poverty and other issues.  This is a fascinating short read.<br /><br />One problem is the authors treatment of the BJP and the Ayodha case.  A very biased opinion is given on the origins of the Ayodha temple and the dispute, with no regard to the history of India, the Islamic colonial occupation of the subcontinent and the rise of Hindu `nationalism'.  Despite this drawback the book is a needed contribution to the paucity of books on India in the post independence period.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-05-26

The book traces the birth of Islam and the injunction to Jihad.  There is no sugar coating here, no pretending that Jihad means `peace' or that Jihad is the `internal struggle'.  Instead a fair presentation is given as to the reasons for Jihad and its manifestation.  The history of Islam is traced, from the 4 early Caliphs, through to the defeats at Constantinople and Tours.<br /><br />We are given a tour of Islam as it spreads and as it confronts Christianity.  We encounter the Crusades.  We see how Islam transformed, became corrupted and attempted reform.  We see the Ottomans at the gates of Vienna and then the `sick man of Europe'.  Great concentration, perhaps 1/3 of the book, is dedicated to the confrontation in India between England, Islam and Hinduism.  It is here that the books strength lies.  The author gives a perfect rendition of the Indian independence struggle and Ali Jinnah and the birth of Pakistan.  An honest assessment is made of how Pakistan became a `home for Islam' and then a `home for terrorism'.  Pakistan is presented, not Saudi Arabia, as the home of international terrorism, due to the ISS support of the Taliban and Osama.<br /><br />There are several generalizations, as there must be in this book.  There is great description of Christian vitriol against Islam and similar Hindu `anti-Islamic' statements.  The reader is told that even Dante was not fair to Islam.  There is great cataloguing of Christian atrocities.  However the reader is not treated to the many Islamic atrocities at places like Famagusta, and oddly Lepanto the turning point of the Mediterranean expansion of the Ottomans is not covered.  This can be attributed to bias on the books part.  Islam is presented as the victim, however it is not clear how this `defensive' Jihad conquered 1/3 of the world?  Many questions are left unanswered and the reader must be cautious for many events are one sided, however this is not apologetic, Islam is also given its due.<br /><br />Seth J.

The idea is to present the weakening of the world powers throughout the world, and the rise of new conflicts.  We see the epic encounters of the Great Powers with smaller powers, such as the Vietnam war.  Important conflicts such as that between Israel and the Arab world is given a fair and unbiased explanation.<br /><br />Smaller conflicts such as the Falklands are also covered, as well as the international system during the cold war.

The warnings had been there all along.  Zhukov was calling him on the phone.  Operation Barbaroosa was already in full swing, the greatest titanic clash of arms the world had ever seen began on June 22nd, 1941.  This book takes the reader through the outbreak of hostilities to the first ten days.  The lead up to the war and the causes of Russia's weak position are given a tour de force of story telling.  We learn how Stalin, while pretending to prepare for war and claiming he knows the attack is coming, puts his army in the worst possible situation.<br /><br />When war comes, the army is helpless, the commanders shaken, and they want leadership.  Stalin offers to resign, and then he disappears.  He is shaken too. He has been betrayed?  Perhaps he worries he will lose his empire?  Zhukov and the few competent Soviet commanders are forced to deal.  In the end millions die, hundreds of thousands are captured.  10 days did no change the world however.  As the Nazis strike deep into Soviet territory already the gears are coming into motion that will make the Russian war machine unstoppable.  For all his failings Stalin had built up a country economically to win, he had instilled an ideology of victory.  Stalin waited for the Germans in Moscow and he declared \\"if the Germans want a war of extermination they will get one.\\"  When Churchill visited in 1942, Stalin said \\"the Germans are not supermen\\".<br /><br />This is a masterful account of these days, an insiders account of the Soviet mindset, a character study of people under crises, no one will be disappointed with this excellent account.<br /><br />Seth J.

The Book is sopposed to be an 'expose' on the 'true' story of King David's life.  However we must ask, what are the sources for this.  The source is the Bible.  So really we are not getting anything true, rather we are getting an investigation into seeming contradictions within the Biblical narrative, which itself may not be 100% accurate.  Since this book doest not include the Hebrew and it is evident that the investigation is not based on the original Hebrew with its nuances then one wonders what this reinterpretation or 'redaction' of the story is really based on, it is based on translation.  So the semi-obvious argument that for instance Samuel ceased to see Saul, it simply based on a misunderstanding of a translation.  Had anyone read the original Hebrew it is clear the message is not that they NEVER saw each other again, it is a nuance, an allusion to a deeper feeling that Samuel did not 'call' on Saul, did not sit and dine with him, did not give him counsel, etc...  Their is no evidence for most oft he conjecture here.  For instance their is no evidence that David didnt kill goliath, just as there is no evidence that Goliath ever existed.  If one is skeptical about the origins of the Bible, it doesnt make logical sense to try to argue within the framework of the text, the text and the belief in its accurace is based on faith, not neccesarily accuracy, despite what we know from Josephus and archeological diggings, no archeology is going to tell us that David actually did so and so, or that he had sex with so and so, since in our modern day we cant even get stories strait who is to expect in 1000 B.C everyong knew everything that took place accuratly?<br /><br />Seth J.

On the one hand we have Liberalism, an ideology loosely based on Communism, that has origins in the equality movements, an ideology today that embraces everything no matter how awful, as long as that thing is a 'different culture'.  Liberalsim today is no more then universal moral relativism, where a terrorist is a 'freedom fighter' and a child molester' is simply exploring his sexuality.<br /><br />Islam is a religion, whose central themes include genocide(Dar al Islam, Dar al Harb), the beating of women(sura 4:34) and sex with 9 year olds(Aeisha).<br /><br />Today Islam and Liberalism find themselves hand in hand.  Liberalism has become a major defendoer of Islam, for although Liberalalism was originally based on secualr ideals like equality, today a liberal defends the viel, the Burka, the Abbaya, becuase today that is 'diversity' thus the beating of a women, 'honor killings' or the suppression of women are part of 'culture' and therefore neccesary.  Thus a Muslim women in Saudi arabia according to liberalism doesnt deserve the same human rights as a western woman becuase the Muslim women has a 'different culture'.  An Arab women who is a victim of an 'honor killing' becuase she had premarital sex isnt entitled to the same human rights defense as a western woman from Canada, becuase in the Arab womans 'culture' an 'honor killing' is 'cultural'.  This book takes a deep and disturbing look at how liberalism has betrayed itself in defending radical, chauvinist Islam in places like Afghanistan(where Liberals found themsleves supporting laws that make it illegal to go to a movie theater and where adultery is punishable by death).  A good analysis of how Human Rights are now based on culture, rather then universality, so that if in a certain culture people have 'different' 'values' for 'human rights' then liberalism will say \\"those people dont need human rights\\".  Thus liberalism becomes a suppressor of human rights, rather then the upholder of those values that as Locke argued are universal.  In essence Liberalism is racism today becuase it argues that certain religions and races, ethnicities and cultures deserve different rights, due to their 'culture'.<br /><br />Seth J.

The reason Africans dont appear in the Bible, isnt becuase the Bible is racist, its because the Bible applied originally to a small tribe(although perhaps not small in those days) of people enslaved by Egypt, who then immigrated to Israel.  The obsession with race has been taken to another level with this book that not only argues the Bible is Egyptian in origin but argues that Egyptians are Africans, whereas just becuase Egypt is in Africa doesnt say much about the ethnic makeup of the Egyptians in 2500 B.C.  This is the problem when one wants to telescope our modenr day racial idelogy into a time before such things mattared.  The Bible didnt mention race because its a modern theory, unless one takes the Biblical narrative of Ham to mean Africans, since Ham went to Africa.  The Bible had a very narrow scope of the world, mostly concentrated on the various peoples of the Middle East and their origins.  It is moronic to try to graft on a modern day obsession with africanizing everything, onto a book and a revelation that dates from a period thousands of years before the common era.  This book is yet another example of historical revisionism and academic hoco-pocos.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-04-27

It is sort of like saying \\"the Missing link did exist but no fossil remains exist\\" its nice because you cant disprove it and by writing a book on it, it seems to cast doubt on something.  This book wants to cast doubt on the Bible and the question of where monotheisim originated and in another retelling of a typical debunking exersize, we are told it originated with AKhanotons cult in Egypt.  The problem is their is no evidence of this, just as their is almost no evidence that the Jews or Israelites or Hebrews were ever in Egypt.  Its the irony that this book wants us to suspect one part of the Bible, namely the question of Sinai and the question of G-ds role with Abraham, while at the same time not questioning the authenticity of the entire Bible.  How can one pick and choose?  How can this book argue that the part about Sinai and the revelation is innacurate, but the part about being slaves in Egypt is true.  It doesnt add up, either one accepts the Bible, or they dont, thats a matter of faith and no amount of psuedo-archeology will prove or disapprove the unprovable.<br /><br />Seth J.

The book is mainly based on environmental mismanagement and how that has led to the total collapse of such diverse societies as Easter Island, the Maya and the Anastazi.  All the accounts are accurate, fascinating and basically true, especially in the case of Easter Island.  But there are a lot of holes in this text.  For instance it tries to connect Easter Island and its overpopulation and destruction of forests with what happened in Rwanda in 1994.  Then it shows a map titled \\"conflicts in the world\\" and a map below it titled \\"environmental problems in the world\\" and both show the exact same countries.  This is just totally fabricated to prove a very weak thesis.<br /><br />What does Rwanda have to do with Easter Island.  Overpopulation destroyed them both.  But in the case of Easter Island it was deforestation that led to unsustainable population whereas in Rwanda the environment was fine, the people were misled into slaughtering each other.  One had racial issues, the other trees.  There is almost nothing in common.  Finally this book includes its first chapter on Montana and environmental problems along the Bitterroot valley.  The subconscious idea is to connect environmental issues such as mining in Montana with Easter Island and to lead the reader to say `oh my god...because of logging our country might destroy itself'.  This is so wildly moronic a connection that it leaves the reader wondering if the book, which grew out of a few lectures and had many research assistants working on it, is simply a collection of stories, with a faked thread between them.  Lastly it is important to note that this survey is far from complete.  It pocks and pans a few societies over the last 2000 years that destroyed themselves, leaving the vast majority that declined for other reasons unmentioned, since they might take away from the overall claim that environmental mismanagement leads to disaster.<br /><br />Seth J.

The war is fascinating because it pitted so many competeing ideologies against one another.  It was a war of secular versus religious.  Of Rural versus urban.  Of fascist versus communist.  of democracies(sort of) verus autocracy.  It was in some ways a popular war versus militarism.  It was a 'world war in minature' and a war of 'two revolutions'.  Thomas is the best chronicler of this, and his higly readable account is must read for everyone interested in the origins of world war two or Spain, or world history in the 20th century.<br /><br />The Spanish civil war was a defining experience not just for Spain but for the various administrations across Europe in the 30s.  It saw the mass intervetnion of both Stalins Russia and Mussoluni and Hitler.  it saw international brigades raised across Europe to fight for one side or another and one found in Spain German communists, having come from exile in spain, fighting against the German condor legion.  Thomas's is slightly weak on his exploration of the origin of the war, perhaps because he does not weight the sheer chaos that was taking place, in part this is due to hsi non-judgemental method of writing, and he should be praised, but one wonders, why he does not give a better detail of just how total chaos had gripped the countyrside in 1936.  He seems to underestimate the red terror, but in the end he is quick to see that both Franco and the Communists wanted only dictatorship in the end, their was no good in the war, only bad, and the end could only be negative.  A fascinating account about a fascinating topic.<br /><br />The military anlalysis is good as are the character descriptions, with a fast lucid style and standard British whit, the text is good for the historian or the laymen.<br /><br />Seth J.

However if you are a person actually interested in the conflict then its not helpful at all.  I have a day in the life Palestinians and this is a totally false and inaccurate account.  ISM is a group dedicated to genocide, financially supported by Saudi Arabia which helps arm, train and protect terrorists. It is not a peace movement as claimed in this book.  ISM provides transportation for suicide bombers, it has been implicated in helping to conceal Kassam rockets in Gaza and it is hand in hand working with terror groups.  When an Israeli child is killed ISM holds celebrations at 'ending the occupation'.<br /><br />Anyone who has actually been to the West Bank or Gaza and travelled there can confirm that this book is not only bhiased but is pure propoganda.

However Mr. Barghouti makes some major errors in describing the reality.  He has obvisouly never travelled to Israel, the country he so abhors and who he blames all his problems on.  First of all let us remmemebr that his nostalgia is for pre 1967 Palestine, a place where women could not vote and only rich landed gentry, like Mr. Barghouti could vote.<br /><br />His Mr. Barghouti is for a Jerusalem where Jews could not pray at their holy site and where Christians were forced to teacht he Koran half the day in school.  His nostalgia is for a country where Jordanian curfews kept people inside most of the time and where Jordanian army troops occupied every inch of the countryside, wher emost villages had no water, no electricity or sanitary services.  Of course Mr. Barghouti is nostalgic for this society for was one where he and his clan made up a small elite of the five or six families who controlled Ramallah and Jerusalem.  His nostalgia is like what a Russian nobleman felt after the rise of Communism.<br /><br />This poetic, well written book is disengenous for it harkens back to a world where the poor had no agency where women had no rights and where his land was occupied by simply a different foreign power.  Although many of his generation still retain framed pictures of the late King Hussein on their walls, it is a fake image, an image of self rule that never existed, an image of a perfect society that only the Palestinian bourgousie could tell.<br /><br />Seth J.

The question here really is not whether or not intellectuals have used Orwell, they have, but rather what is the nature of Orwell that appeals to people to do so.<br /><br />Perhaps it is worth understanding Orwell.  Orwell was an English radical, a communist who went to fight in the Spanish Civil War and very much opposed Churchill style conservative natioanlism.  Then Orwell realized the evils of Stalinst style communism and wrote books such as 1984, and ANimal Farm, trying to come to grips with the monster state, the police state that was the Soviet Union. Orwell never stopped being a socialist, he never stopped being a leftist, but he realized that the worst forms of Leftism were actually the same as the worst form of the right.  In the 1930s as Hitler gobbled up Europe Orwell found himself on the side of Churchill opposing Nazism.<br /><br />Orwell never became a right winger.  But he became a thoughtful leftist and this is what lodges in this books throat, that Orwell dared to change, he dared to grow up and dared to realize not every conservative, such as Winston, was evil and that not every leftist, like Stalin, was a saint.  Hitchens also grew up.  And many other intellectuals such as Horowitz and Podhoretz grew up, changed, and realized some of their colleagues were wrong.  And this book is merely a character assasination of anyone who dares to challenge the monolith of leftism.  It pretends to assautl those who defend the 'establishment' but in fact Hitchens is still fighting the establishment, he is fighting the liberal estblishment, sort of like in 1984.<br /><br />Seth J.

However as most people know 99% of writing on Israel is by the same people whose essays appear in this book, Chomsky(a defender of holocaust denial), Finkelstien(known anti-semite), and Said(known anti-Israel brainwasher at Columbia).  So here we basically have a compendium of their thoughts.  Perhaps the only use would be if someone wanted to purchase this rather then three books by these three chaps, and then this goes a good way towards combining and giving a little spoonful of grule rather then the whole meal.<br /><br />The text is full of fabrications and half truths.  THe greatest myth presented here is that the media and literature is pro-ISrael.  Anyone familiar with the subject knows this is inaccurate.  Secondly a section of this book is devoted to 'debunking' Joan peters excellent work on the true origins of Palistinians.  Third we get more of the meal served up explaining the true 'ancient' roots of Palestine.  Lastly we get the wodnerful photograph on the cover which wasnt even taken in Israel, but rather is an image from Egypt, but it suits the rest of the story, the myth that Palistinians are poor, when in fact their average GDP per capita is twice and Israelis, the myth that Palistinians dont have land, when the average palistinian has 2.3 times as much square feet as an Israeli.<br /><br />A fantastic and wonderful case of deception and full of anti-Israel dribble, diatribe, propoganda, brainwashing at its best.  a sad account of what the debate has come down to.<br /><br />Seth J.

His politics, called Fascist in the West, were populism, combined with a stiff necked admiration for Stalin and for Russia's former Czars who extended the borders and brought RUssia Pride.  And in the end this is what this book is about.  Western Liberals, so proud of telling everyone how Nasser brougth 'pride' to Egypt were alarmed that a Russian, nay a Slav, dared to want the same for his nation.  Zhironsky scared the west, he dared to say he would whipe Pakistan from the map, crush the Afghans, the Turks and deport those who to this day enslave Russians and commit terrorism in Russia.  But Zhirinovsky failed, his views which many agreed with, were washed under the carpet or at least not spocken of, and he has ceased to be important.  When this was written this was not the case and in the end this book serves as a wonderful diatribe and a window into the soul searching that took place in post soviet Russia when ex-communists turned natioanlists beleived their country could be reborn, but that was before the Russian army failed to prove itself in Chechnya in 1994.<br /><br />Seth J.

This book pretends to use statistics to show that the media is pro-Israel, the idea here is that the myth of 'good' Israel must be exploded.  This is the standard anti-Israel theory and diatribe, set up a situation where you convince someone how 'everyone' is taught Israel is wonderful so that you can brainwash them yourself with anti-Israel rhetoric.  Its like the old brocken record of claiming that 'everyone' knows muslim women are oppressed so we must explain how muslim women are actually better off then muslim men.<br /><br />This book is full of half truths, partial lies and some outright falsehood.  Mohammed al Dura for one was shot by Palistinains.  Secondly just because a few british kids dont know anything about Israel doesnt neccesarily lead to the conclusion that means the media is biased.  THose kids also dont know anything about Ghana, does this mean the media is biased towards Myanmar?  One doesnt preclude the other, or lead to it.<br /><br />For the anti-Israel mafia this book is required reading and will insulate their world where they beleive everything is pro-Israel, despite what they see on the evening news.<br /><br />Seth J.

It is an interesting theory, and given it one must conclude that therefore the West should either A) only hire muslims to report on Muslims or B) not report on the Islamic world.<br /><br />This is not however the conclusion.  Rather the conclusion is that the West becuase it is 'bad' and 'colonial' is projecting a false image of Islam everywhere it reports about it.<br /><br />Let us take some examples and see what this is talking about.  The argument is that the west is always biased and always giving us the wrong view of wonderful islam.<br /><br />1)  Saudi Arabia-where women cannot drive, cant vote and can be beheaded for adultery.  All this is a fact but apparently to report these facts would be biased, thus by doing so the western media encourages the unfair analysis that muslim countries discriminate against women, even though they do.<br /><br />2)  Chechnya, Bosnia and Israel- in both cases the media is strongly pro-musim in the West, however this is overlooked in this case.  In a case where the media is pro-Muslim this book simply ignores the fact.<br /><br />3) Afghanistan and Pakistan:  to islamist states where blasphemy is illegal, where a woman can be beaten by her husband and where a woman who is raped can be killed by her family.  WOnderful, and if the media reports these things then the media is anti-Islamic, becuase it dared to report something that might make westerners who are used to this 'colonial' idea that women are equal, wonder about Muslim societies where they are not.<br /><br />The myth is clear and the argument is clear.  90% of Muslim countries have laws that discriminate against women.  For the media to report this would be wrong becuase then westerners might getthe idea 100% of Muslims discriminate against women.  Since this is the basic argument here then probably the conclusion should have been that no culture should ever be allowed to report about another culture since by doing so the one culture might be coompared to the home culture and thus it would be biased reporting.  Total nonsense.<br /><br />Seth J.

However there exist two major problems with this text.  The first is the use of the word 'ethnic cleansing' a term coind by americans to excuse the was in Bosnia and Kosovo, it was a term that was sopposed to embody racism and remind us of the Holocuast.  However the term is disengenous and inaptly applied.  Their is a difference between genocide and ethnic cleansing and their is a difference actually between ethnic cleansing and what happaned in Kosovo.  No ethnicity was actually  cleansed in Bosnia or Kosovo, rather religions assaulted eachother, same ethnicity, different religion.<br /><br />The Armenians genocide and the Holocaust do not even compare with the Bosnia conflict.  And Stalins deportation of the Ingush and Chechans, a truly ethnic cleansing operation, also is incomparable.<br /><br />The second flaw is that huge tracts of cleansing are missed in this account.  What of the pogroms and slaugthers that befell minorities in 1913, and again in the 1920s as maps were redrawn?  What of the population transfers in Cyprus?  What of Stalins genocide of the Russian Poles and Germans and many other peoples?<br /><br />This is a worthwhile account but the reader must be cautioned to know that these incidents are very different, and that not every case of european 'cleansing' is brought to the surface here.<br /><br />Seth J.

It is an excellent study of country by country analysis with a plethora of data on ethnic groups and surveys.<br /><br />Espeically trying to understand the North caucuses and its many 'republics' that exist within the Russian state and Siberia and its many ethnic tribal groups this book is the best on the subject and has not been surpassed or updated by another account.<br /><br />Every state is accounted for and their is a major focus on the ethnic breakdowns of the regions, which is very important in trying to understand places like Tajikistan and Georgia or Abkhazia or Degastan.  Most of these places are either so foreign, so marginal or so small that despite press accounts understadning the multi-ethnic dimensions is hard.  The author gives a quick history of each place and stresses how the upheavels of the War and Stalins deportations and Lenin's fake national creation policies created nations where non existed before and awakened people hitherto unawakened.  TOpics such as literature and language are touched on as is politics.  It is fascinating to understand Moldova or the problems of citizenship in latvia, which is 1/3 Russian.  Explaining the Russian diaspora is as fascinating and trying to make sense of the assimilated regions of the Volga, including the Tarters.<br /><br />Special emphasis is given to stateless groups such as the Cossacks, and the various bands, Kuban, and Terek are illuminated.  Quite possiblyh this is the most masterful account fot he diversity of the old USSR and how the diversity plays out today in rivalries and conflicts.  The book is an unbiased as it can be in discussing the Armenian-Azerbaijan war and Chechnya, both touchy unresolved conflicts.

This is something new and fascinating.  Here we have a text that seeks to examine Churchill the legend, the man, the history of him and his relationship with the english speaking world since 1945.  Chapters include investigations of Churchills funeral, 'operation Hope Not' and Churchill 'failure' to lose World War Two, the Finest Hour.  Here we learn of Churchill's FUlton speech and also his famous relationship with America, as an honorary citizen no less.<br /><br />Most interesting are chapters on Churchills relationship with Australia and Canada as well as new anecdotes about why Castro and Guliani, who agree on nothing, both are admirers of Winston.  This book also examines the many biographers of Churchill, including Manchester, Gilbert and Jenkins.<br /><br />THe conlusion is that Churchill is not simply the 'man of the century' but perhaps of the next one as well.  This is a tour de force and every Churchill admirer must read it, in fact anyone interested in histiography or in the western egnlish speaking world since 1945 will enjoy this.

For instance we learn of the rise of nationalism in the Caucuses, central asia, Finland, Ukraine and the Baltic states.  We learn also of how Islam is actually a new creation among the Cauceses and in Central Asia, that in fact most of these peoples were not converted to Islam in the 1800s but the rise of Russia, the decline of the Ottomans and the entrance of Sufism actually solidified and normalized Islam in these socieites that had been very tribal with their own distinct customs.<br /><br />The conflict in Chechnya and current RUssia under Yeltson helps make sense of Yeltsins disposal of Gorbachev and then subsequent bombarding of the 'White House'.

Between 1870 and 1920 we see the awakening of the Germans, a realization not only of the cultural and literary as well as economic and scientific achievements of Germans but also of the importance of the German communities across EUrope from Finland to the Baltic states to Eastern Europe and america.  The German empire stretched in Africa and the pacific.  Today one finds that Tsingtao beer is actually German in Origin.<br /><br />And what of those Hessians who tried to stime the American revolution?  THis book didnt touch on these subjects and for this it deserves critique.  it doesnt deserve critique for trying to prove that the Third Reich is not all their is to German history.  In fact a new history is needed of Germany and the Germans.  Germans, the culture, the language is interesting and important, not least becuase of the fall of the roman empire, but also for subtle factors such as the rise of Prussia, the influence of German on Anglo-Saxon, the importance of the Tuetonic knights and the conversion of Eastern Europe.<br /><br />But what of the Germans. What of the fate of those German communities that streched from Poland to Romania to the Baltic?  What of the linguistic ties between Germany, Flanders and the Netherlands.  What of those half dozen electors of the Holy Roman Empire?  What about the linguistic differences of South and North German, East and West and Austria?<br /><br />A new history is needed and this only partially fills the gap.<br /><br />Seth J.

I purchased it before embarking for India.  THe ice age,  and the people who emerged, something about this period of history is fascinating.  This was a time when man was embarking on his struggle to be become what we are today.  Culture, religion, even tribe were taking shape.  Cultivation of plants, the herding people settling down and then being dispersed again.  This book is a tour de force in one respect, its grandeur, its ability to whisk the reader from Jericho to India, to CHina and then to the AMericas.  To explain the tale of human history in this period that we have so little information about.<br /><br />But that being said something about this book is almost unreadable.  It is the authors 'ingenious' style of using a character from the 19th century to see all this important information.  Since archeology and anthropology is basically boring to the pedestrian, to the non-professional, the author wants to use a 19th century companion of Darwin to understand how the people lived after the ice age.  The idea is to put the reader back in time, to literally sit by the fires of the people in 18000 B.C.  But their is a problem here.  It is a little disconcerting and it made this reader angry to have to wade through so much speculation.  Albeit the science is a real sleeper, but this style makes it a little too popular.<br /><br />An important book, but the style may throw some people off.  And since this book is for the non-professional, the mention of Mr. Sykes doesnt matter.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-03-15

It is an interesting diagnosis and one most anti-americans and self hating americans are sure to agree with. The problem is that their is little historical evidence of either, neither has america been a nationalist country(compared to the natioanlism of fascism or the nationalism of Nasser) and neither has america given undue suspicion to foriegners, only being suspicious of those foriegners who come to America with the intention say of  flying airliners into buildings.<br /><br />The author doesnt take into account that after Sept 11th most of the voices in America were ones blaming america, and that almost every academic in america beleives America is evil.  It is an interesting kind of natioanlism when the elites of the country hate the country, its actually an 'anti-nationalism'.  One might consider the outocmes of a terrorism attack on say Iran that killed 3000 people to see what the normal response would be.<br /><br />The books diagnoses of how america is suspicous if foreigners is also interesting as it is incorrect.  The prime examples he looks at is Muslims after 2001 and Catholics in the 1860s, and no doubt he gets the second example from the film \\"Gangs of New York\\".  Unfortunatly the suspicion of foriegners is one result of having a coountry made up 98% of non-natives.  But is America more suspicous then other nations?  The data would show thatin fact america is the most accepting and least suspicous of all nations in the world.<br /><br />The books last flaw is its drawing a parrellel with Israel.  If the books original thesis, that america is hateful towards foreigners, was true then it would also logically apply that Jews as foreigners would come under the 'hated' category.  Thus either the points about america's alliance with Israel(and england) are either false or the idea that america hs undue suspicion is false.

It is interesting that for the decades where the arab was seen as coming out of Lawrence of Arabia and he was seen as noble and honest that no one wrote a book about how distorted that view was in portraying bedouin culture as so grande when in fact it is not.<br /><br />THis book goves tot he other extreme.  It is true that arabs have from time to time been seen in a 'negative' light.  But if one counts up all the 'bad' guy images in american culture they will find they are overhwelmingly white.  The mere fact that arabs actually did cause the terrorism in america is a good bases for people to stereotype them, and culture has donee verything it can int he opposite direct to make everyone 'appreciate' and 'love' the Koran and Islam. Their are almost no negative images in popular culture of Arabs or Muslims.  Rather it is in the culture of the street where such negative images sometimes get by the censors and people are allowed to talk about them.  This book is simply incorrect, no data is presented and no research was done into counting just how many 'negative' images are being seen, the book relies on hearsay and a general feeling that 'negative stereotypes' must be 'combatted'.

The irony of the liberalism here is that in the 1930s and 1970s the same liberalism was used to describe how Soviet Communism would triumph over western capitalism.  Then the academics heralded the progress in central asia, whereby women were no longer stoned for adultery, whereby women could actually show their faces in public, whereby women could go to school and, worst of all perhaps for the touchy `culture' women might actually speak their minds, vote, enroll in the military and get divorces.<br /><br />Today those liberal triumphs are condemned by the same liberals for being against the culture.  One thing can be sure, if you read through the lines of this book, Communism did reform the backward cultures, it brought light to people who only 40 years before had never had Veils, but had created a Veil in response to Sufi missions, and then Communism came and removed the degrading Veils.  It was an assault on a fake culture that had never existed.  The communist obsession with finding tribal identities amongst the many turko-mongolian peoples of Central Asia is perhaps more interesting and less biased.  And for these two topics this is worth reading, but be careful not to be taken in by the idea that wearing a veil is somehow liberating to a women, because actually it just makes women into objects.<br /><br />Seth J.

This tells the story of Communism's tentative strides towards making its Central Asian empire one of equality while at the same time trying to encourage ethnic individualism.  Communism had railed against the Tsar's empire, thus when it came into contact with the Steppe peoples of Central Asia, mostly of ethnic Mongolian stock who had recently been converted to Islam and where women were required to wear long heavy veils(as evidenced by the wonderful photo on the cover and within).<br /><br />The Communists had a two track approach.  On the one hand they continued their ethnic encouragements to create separate republics out of the tribal material.  Yet at the same time Communists opened schools for women, enrolled girls for the first time, taught women to read, and within a short time had even trained the first Uzbek female patrooper.  These successes were coupled with `veil burning' events where women would be protected by tough honorable communist youth as they burned the symbols of their oppression.  But this sparked protest, ethnic and religious.<br /><br />The author weaves a wonderful story, the book is full of replete moral equivalency, so the Russians who are liberators of women are also seen as `imperialists' somehow suppressing a culture, but if one reads between the lines they will see that the pictures alone show the truth of Communisms crusade to bring equal rights to Asia.  The process has reversed itself today, but for a short time in the 1920s idealism triumphed and women could walk down the street with their hair flowing proudly behind them, no longer confined to anonymity behind a Burka.

The authors prose moves from describing the key parts of Israel to a massive cast of characters who took part in the hostilities from weapons purchasers in California, to Trumans advisors, down to the soliders on the ground, Jewish and Arab, including the wives of many and the survivors of such key clashes as the Etsion bloc and the Haddassah convoy.  Those reading about 1948 for the first time will be enthralled, veteran students of the 1948 war and Israeli history will find hundreds of new facts that one never knew existed.  The authors sources are beyond reproach, ebing key individuals on both sides, and including such interesting personalities as Abdullah Tel to Mordechai Raaanan.  The book does not read as a biased text, rather the author puts himself into the midnset of each actor so that one comes away with a deeper understanding then one finds in a dry historical commentary.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book, a good introduction to Israeli history, as well as a classic text and a needed addition to anyones book shelf who specializes or enjoys Israeli, middle east history.

Let us look at a few topics.  The book claims Islam is a religion of world peace.  This is only accurate in the sense that the Qu'ran orders its followers to kill the entire non-beleiving world, then there is World peace, the world is divided into two parts by the Quran, the Dar Al-Harb(the world of war) and Dar al-Islam/Salaam(world of islam/peace).  SO within the muslim world, between muslims, in theory there is peace. BUt in the rest of the non-muslim world there is only the command to kill.  This can be deduced by anyone reading the Koran.<br /><br />The second major lie is the position of women in the islamic world.  This book pretends that women are 100% equal in all muslim countries and that the Koran gives equality to women.  If the Quran gives equality then why does Surah 4:34 say \\"beat your wife\\".  Once again this myth coneveyed in this book can be easily put aside by reading an accurate translation of the Quran or by learning Arabic.  If women are equal in Islam then why do they by law have to wear burkas and Abbayas, whereas men have no such modesty laws applied to them?  THis book doesnt begin to answer this obviosu question.<br /><br />Anyone interested in being brainwashed, in getting a lovely rosy and fake picture of Islam should read this book, anyone wanting their children to convert to Islam should definetly pick this up.  If you are interested in Islam it is more worthwhile to read the Quran.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2005-01-18

Although Jerusalem had been but a side show and not a prime objective, it ended up being one of the symbols and one of the most important victories in the war.<br /><br />Famous scenes of men crying at the Western Wall(the holiest site in Judaism) and Dayan(eye patch included) strolling down the Old city steps.  Similar important battles such as Ammunition hill went down in Israeli military history as some of the bloodiest and bravest ever fought.<br /><br />Of all the books on the six day war, this is by far the best one on the Battle for jerusalem.  Many subjects are covered, including the many units involved, the commands, the ordinary soldiers, the UN workers, the Mayor, the Israeli museum, the children and the hospital staff.  Few people are left unmentioned in this tour of the battlefield, that puts the reader in the picture.  The only downside of this book, like most on the conflict, is an almost total lack of maps and few if any acounts of the jordanian experience.

Most people will accept that the crossing of the red sea, the miracles and all, are a myth.  Likewise most people can assume that to some extend the stories in the Bible, like Joshua's conquest of Israel, are mythologized.<br /><br />But the claim in this book is not that these myths are reminiscent of some history but rather that no Israelites existed, no Hebrews ever existed and everything about the stories of the Bible is fake.  So while we are told to accept that the Caananites are real, even though the source for them is also biblical, we are told that the idea of a single God is totally made up and that the entire history of ancient Israel never happened.<br /><br />The evidence for this is simply the lack of evidence.  It is sort of tantamount to saying since we don't have evidence as to when the Native Americans came to America then apparently they never came.  Well then who are all those people?  Its almost like saying that since we don't know how the pyramids were built, then apparently they were never built.  But they got there somehow?  If Josiah created the history of the Israelitenation, then where did Josiah come from? If King Solomon is fake then why is his presence confirmed in other traditions throughout the ancient world, throughout Africa and the middle east.  If ancient Israel didn't exist and they never believed in one God then who built the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, and who fought the Romans in 70 A.D and who was Jesus born to.  The problem here is that archeological evidence does actually date all the digging in Israel to the time of David and Solomon.  Evidence exists from Persia and from Egypt of diplomatic dealings with an Israelite and even a Canaanite state.  Thus the Bible is accurate in many of its time line descriptions, it is simply inaccurate in its descriptions of Miracles.  This book is revisionism and should not be read by anyone interested in the accuracy of the Bible.<br /><br />Seth J.

In condemning the destruction of the Babri Masjid this book doesn't seem to point to any of the reasons for it.  Not once is one given the context of the rise of Hindu movements.  No one is told that millions of Hindus were killed in Genocidal operations in Pakistan in 1948, ethnically cleansed from their ancient homes.  Not once are we reminded of the 1000 years of British and Muslim imperial domination and colonialism of India.<br /><br />Rather this book assumes the Hindu movements and their chauvinist nature came from no where and thus the author takes them to task and skewers them for their militancy.  While this book seem to understand and commiserate with Muslim militancy, it never once excuses the same violence in communal riots from the other side, although the statistics are usually shown, giving evidence of the two sided nature of the rioting, where members of both communities are killed.<br /><br />The tragedy of this book is that it is very detailed but overwhelmingly biased.  Many times we hear that the Hindu movements are `elitist, brahmanical' without any correleatons to he reasons why.  The book says the movements harked back to a fake `golden age' but doesn't think to describe the reasoning for this.  Thus anyone interesting in  the BJP and the like will be displeased here unless you are fanantically anti-hindu.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-12-26

If we take that to be the starting point then let us imagine what the author would have felt was an 'honest' approach.  THis would apparently have been to do what the Soviets did, support the 22 Arab states and 200 million Arabs against the 1 non-muslim state and the 5 million Israelis.  'honost' brokering would have been something along what the Iraqi's did to the Kurds, maybe the use of Gas by the U.S to crush Israel, this is apparently the conclusion one is sopposed to draw from this unabashadly biased account.<br /><br />The list of the U.S dishonest actions appears to be that the U.S dared to support Israel, dared to allow Israel to buy weapons and then dared to not give into the Oil cartel of the Arabs in 1973.  The other 'dishonest' parts of the deal are apparently the U.S efforts to broker peace with Egypt, the U.S support of King Hussien, the U.S support of Afgahnistan against Russia, and the U.S attempt to stop the genocdie in Lebanon.

Unfortunately in this attempt it makes more mistakes, creates history and fabricates important works so as to resemble nothing more then a polemical fictionalized account of the actual texts and events involved.  A few of the major errors are:<br /><br />  Although the Old Testament is accused of being a fabrication and fake this book nevertheless accuses Jews of inventing Holy war, so while Moses is said to not be a real person, we are still told that Joshua waged genocide.  Although the word 'war' appears more in the Koran then any other topic this book describes Islam's relation to war as 'general' and says Jihad is more a moral struggle, meanwhile missing that half the Koran is incitement to war, including an entire chapter titled 'spoils'.  Jesus is accused of being a war monger and the pacifism of Christianity is said to be 'fake' explaining that the real message of Jesus was holy war, even though a cursory reading of the New Testament reveals no such word.<br /><br />  Although this was supposed to be a study of actual 'Holy War' it deteriorates into an anti-western diatribe, trying to explain how although Europe became Secular in 1789 that the west is still waging a 'holy war' in the exporting of McDonalds or the export of such fanatical religious principles as democracy.<br /><br />  Terrorism, suicide bombing and genocide are  termed 'rebellions' and the book explains how most of the victims of terrorism are in fact Muslims, although data doesn't show this to be true.  This is one of the strangest books ever written.  For a book that begins with chapters titled 'Islam and War' and 'Christianity and War' it appears as if the author never read the Bible, the Torah or the Koran, since no such quotes are used and there is a total gap in any understanding of the concept of war in all three.

The fact that Hitler gave his power to Adiral Doenitz upon defeat is usually forgotten accept for WWII buffs and those fascinated by the Nazi elite.  THis book delves into something more interesting, the rise and fall of Eric Raeder one time Grand Admiral of the German Fleet.  He had served in the High seas fleet and suffered the years of decline during the 20s.  Although in some ways a defense for his role in Nazism this book is nevertheless a very interesting look into the German navy, one arm of Nazism that was left to some extent untouched by the horrors of thuggish fascism.  An interesting look at another side of WWII, from a branch often forgotten about.	2004-12-21

From chapters on family life to sexuality, including chapters on the eslavement and kidnapping of the slaves and explaining the differences between practices in rural areas and urban this is a fascinating work.  The author is encumbered by a concern not to offend so he slices through the subject with zeal, revealing how pregnant female slaves were beaten, explaining that abortion was more common then thought and startling the reader with his descriptions of the African women with 'bodies seemingly designed for pleasure'.<br /><br />Making use of a veriety of sources from palace records to individual letters, common accounts and colonial writings, this scholarship far surpases most work on the subject.<br /><br /> By far the most illuminating account of slavery in Muslim soceities, although a narrow work it serves a smirror not only for other scholarship on the subject but also for the apologists who regard slavery in Muslim societies as a noble ideal.  A must read.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-12-21

These Jews found themselves under Vichy Administration in 1940 and Italian administration in Libya.  The same racial laws applied to Jews and work camps were set up for many.  Nevertheless the Jews of North Africa escaped the fate of those in Europe.<br /><br />The most fascinating portion of this book details the homegrown anti-Semitism of the French administration of North Africa, a right wing and socialist phenomenon that began before World War Two and lasted after the liberation by the U.S army. Of interest also is the treatment of Jews in the Italian sector.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-12-21

Thus the `Masada myth' must be revised just as the `Jesus Myth' or the George Washington `myth' must be revised, the people involved must be defamed and somehow this makes history more pure, more accurate and more `fair'. But what is behind all these works of defamation is not a `search for the truth' but rather a search to do the opposite of what one perceives is untrue, or embellished history.  Did the Zealots all commit suicide at Masada?  Has the `last stand' been glorified by a nation in search of a national heroic myth?  This is the base question, but the answer is not what one would expect.  Rather then explaining the problems of the source i.e Josephus, and concluding that perhaps we don't know exactly what happened at Masada the author of this book works hard to portray every person described by Josephus and the excavations of Yadin as the opposite.  So rather then the Romans using Jewish slaves suddenly the Romans are honorable peace lovers and the Jewish `Zealots' become murders and thugs.  But what is interesting here is that there is NO bases for alluding to the Zealots as `thugs' and `murderers'.  Whereas the Masada story, of people committing suicide to stop Roman tyranny is at least based on a historical account, one written by someone who lived during the event, and told of it through accounts he recorded.<br /><br /> Similar attempts to question the New Testament also work hard to pretend that Jesus never existed, which is yet again an example of how revisionism goes to far.  In order to seek an accurate telling of history one does not have to pretend that every known historical fact never happened.  This book is mostly a hateful spiteful book that alludes to many transgressions without confirming or denying anything; rather the only thing proved here is that the idea of Masada was embellished, sort of like the Boston massacre or any important nation-founding event. Historians today like to debunk national events, not to clarify history, but to serve their own political ends, the end here is nothing less then the defamation and delegitmization of Israel, a sad conclusion to an important topic.<br /><br />Seth J.

The slave soldier neither has the interest or the caring to defend his homeland, rather like a mercenary he fights for his life and runs away at the earliest possible moment when all seems lost. This book develops the scholarship on Islam's early use of slave soldiers, making the arguemtn that the weakness and distrust of the early Islamic rulers led them to adopt slaves, who had no kin, no tribe, and therefore would be apolitical.  The fact that all four of the first Caliphs were assasinated certainly helped this idea on its way.  The second major factor in choosing slaves is that the Bedouin soldiers and raiders who propelled Islam out of Arabia were not reliable soldiers and could not wage set piece battles, all though this military fact is overlooked this is a good study and goes half way to explaining the failure of Islamic Jihadist armies at Lepanto and Poiters.<br /><br />Seth J.

This work docuents not just the history of the massive slave trade to Arab lands, that numbered in the millions stretching back to the 7t century but more importantly this book documents modern day slavery in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the middle east and north africa.  Here we are given an insight into many parts of the Islamic slave trade, a fascinating topic.  The final chapter is an interesting discussion of the role of women in Islamic societies and documents many sad and cruel rituals that women undergoe in rural soceity throughout the middle east.  These rituals involve such barbaric practices as bleeding the women to make sure she is a virgin during the marriage ceremony.  An important quick read.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-12-13

Here we learn that the Islamic slave trade was made up primarily of women.  The book helps to aswer this phenomenon by showing that not only were women used as Sex slaves in North Africa but that women from many traditional east african soceities performed much of the work, thus making them more productive.  The questions sourounding the role of women in the slave trade is given a variety of looks.  One slave girls narrative tells of how her mother is left to starve by the slave master who subsequently buries the daughter alive.  This is the truth of slavery and especially the turth of slavery as it was propogated by Zanzibar in East Africa.  Slaves were not 'protected' or treated as human beings, they were simply meat, frequently disgarded along the way when they got sick or seemed weak.  This book finally exposes the truth about slavery fcusing on the enslavement of women and the role of women in slave soceities.  Above all it shows that many of the African men, despairing of the arab slave caravans who took most of their women, turned to brigandage and joined roving bands of warlords, thus ensuring that Arfican pride would not be darkened by the cruel evils of slavery and its targeting of women by Sexual predators from the middle east and europe.<br /><br />Seth J.

The fact remains despite all the pretending is that these people were slaves, to be bought and sold as meat and used as the masters pleased, frequently being raped and beaten.

In these caravans frequently half the slaves would be left by the side of the road to die.  Many of the female slaves, who made up more thenhalf the slaves, would be raped and degraded.  Upon arrival in the North many of the male slaves were used in the military while the women were sold as concubines, sex slaves.  This book examines the slave trade from many viewpoints, addressing key important gaps in the scholarship.  This is one of the few works on the subject and is a wonderful beggining for the study of the Saharan slave trade. Bernard Lewis's general history of Race and Slavery in Islam makes a good companion to this volume.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-12-13

The focus here is on the Africans sent to North Africa via the slave routes stretching acorss the Sahara and those beggining in Zanzibar.  Between the 7th century and the present it is estimated that 11 million Africans were taken as Slaves to the muslim world.  This book explains how they were captured, transported and most important their new lives in the Muslim world.  Usual accounts paint a picture of a paradise where a slave lived as an equal and assimilated into the Muslim soceity.  The reality was quite different then the western myth.  This book tells of African women chosen only for their sexual attributes then used as sex slaves, any resulting children would be sold or 'pimped' off by the owner rather then living freely as Qu'ranic law sopposedly guaranteed.  Here we have a wonderful new account of the Africans deported to North Africa, a story frequently overlooked in western history, which is all to often caught up in self flagulation of describing the Atlantic slave trade.<br /><br />Seth J.

This book tries to divinate the truth and the origin of the 'curse of Ham' since over the generations many have perverted the bible to show that the descendants of Ham were African and were also meant to be slaves.  The truth is a little different.  Just as Atalantic slavers used the exuse that africans were not human to enslave them thus Muslims likewise used the excuse that africans could be enslaved as pagans.  But the Bible was simply used as an easy way to not feel guilty about slavery.  The reality was that slavery was practiced not just against Africans and that the race of Africans had little to do with slavery.  Rather the slave trade seems to have been so long and prosperous in Africa due to the Africans being active participants, the lack of a unified empire in Africa to oppose slavery and the lack of other sources of humans to serve as slaves.  After all we know that Rome enslaved the Gauls and other europeans.  But when Europe developed a strong state the only europeans open to being enslaved where those colonized by the Ottomans.  Likewise the depopulation that followed the Islamic conquest of the middle east meant that slaves could not come from thos eregions.  Slaves certainyl couldnt be transported out of China.  Thus Africa became the meat market for human cruelty, the sickness of slavery that eventually consumed and destroyed african soceity.  But among the warrior tribes such as the Zulu we do not see enslavement, why?  Because they dared to raise the sword against the Perverts who came to buy their daughters into slavery.  The 'curse of Ham' had little to do with Africa rather it had more to do with Humans and the weakness of the state.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-12-13

The author, not interested with the fate of the slaves but rahter focusing on the actual process and transformations of slavery in Africa lends his qonderful analysis to the Altantic slave trade and the Islamic slave trade.  Here he gives the reader all the important facts.  FOr instance he documents how more then 2.3 million slaves were shipped by Arab slavers to North Africa and beyond from 1600-1800, at the same time as 7 million were shipped across the atlantic.  Drawing on a wide range of sources this book tells the tale of slavery down to the minute detail.  From who were the buyers to where the cources of slaves were, to the brutal methods used to kidnap the slaves themselves.  A social and economic analysis as well as a cultural understanding is given to the slave trade.  Most important this book casts light on the huge numbers of slaves sent across the Sahara to the slave markets of the Islamic empire.  The only small drawbacks are a few minor generalizations made in the introduction but otherwise this is a masterful account.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-12-13

Here we learn not only of the roots of Slavery in the Sudan where the Arab Muslim north has been enslaving the African south for more then a thousand years but we also learn of the role of race in the conflict as well as the more interesting role of the English in denying slavery.  One chapter in particular shows how the English, sent to abolish slavery, actually upheld it by reclassifying household slaves as 'domestic servants'.  Thus slavery was never legally abolished in the Sudan the way it was in Egypt and the Ottoman empire.  Rather the average person today in the Sudan sees nothing morally wrong with owning slaves or raping slave girls.<br /><br />This book is an impassioned plea to the world to wake up to the reality of the Sudanese genocide, the racist fascist civil war that has gone on for 40 years.  Yet one knows the track record of the world, of humanity, when it comes to stopping genocide.  That record is 0-4(Rwanda, Cambodia, The Holocaust, the Sudan).  In fact the Sudan was recently picked by the U.N to head the human rights commission.  This is why books like this are so important, to perhaps help one ignorant person realize that horror, genocide, slavery and racism are not just what one reads in the history books, rather they are happening today and have a burden of history attached to them.  An important book, the best book on the Sudanese civil war.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-12-13

This book finally begins to fill in one gap in this important hisotry of slavery and african peoples.  Here we learn the true story of the Zenj, an African people taken from their lands and used as sexual slaves and servants in Iraq.  They revolted, suceeded and were fianlyl crushed.  In the end they suffered genocide and their descendants are no longer visible in Arab lands, like the other million Africans deported to the middle east, they disappeared.

This is the story of the Jews, but more then that it is a story of Europe, the times, the culture, the politics, the arts, and of minority rights in a continent torn by ideas.  This is the essential work for the period and covers such an array of personalities as to both suprise and stun.  From Poland's Pisudski, to Kafka, Freud, and Bela Kun.  All the major actors are here, painted in a wonderful matter and shown in the times and places that made them, the context of their relations within or with the Jewish community is the crowning acheivement in this excellent study.<br /><br />This book takes us inside the worlds of Poland, where Jews amounted to 10 percent, inside the congresses in AMerica where concerned Jews lobbied on behalf of their ancestors in easter europe.  Here we learn of forgotten genocides in Ukraine in the 1920s and of the situation of German Jews and also of the oft not studied Jews of Bulgaria and Hungary.

Rather it is a history of the 'border culture' and the U.S involvement uaually in Northern Mexico as financiers and owners of industry, from car manufacturing to Oil and railroads.  AMericans have had an impact on mexico, usually one that is viewed by the nationalist Mexican academics and anti-american self hating U.S academics as detrimental and 'colonialist'.  This summation of the encounter is not all together fair when one considers that Americans may not own land in mexico and that all AMerican landownings were illegally confiscated by the mexican government, while the U.S dishes out billions in health care to illegall aliens. But this is a history of that encounter.<br /><br />Nevertheless the more interesting topic of how the Mexican governemnt settled its northern borders is not covered.  The Mexican suppression of Native peoples and exploitation of its people is not covered either. This is the downfall<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-12-05

A Jewish refugee living on the West bank is \\"wrong\\", he should not live there and it is not fair that if he chooses to live there that he might choose to live in a safe place, with gorgeous vistas.  This book was compiled by left wing Israelui architects, whose meager experience in politics does not dull their hatred of the country for which they have worked in the past, namely the state of Israel.  Their arguments are strong, they dont think its fair that Jewish villages happen to be located on hill tops or that those villages happen to be clean and neat and tidy or that those villages have defenses like fences to keep people out.<br /><br />The book begs the question of what is so interesting about a village in the west bank.  The Authors are entirely racist in that they do not also covers similar settlements in the American west or the Moroccan occupied Western Sahara.  This book doesnt draw any parrallels between places throughout the world where immigrants have designed new communities, out of fear or in order to live safely and in culturally homogenous places.  THus in the end this racist narrow minded presentation falls far short oft he great work it could have been.  it could have shown how early Islamic occupation of the same area was also dominate dby hilltop villages and armed military camps, as in the Roman period.  THe subject lacks depth and history, whereas the subject itself; how immigrants settle land, is an amazing one.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-12-05

Unfortunately today American history has been withered and scattered by the assault of revisionism.  This book brings back to life the honest truths, things such as the fact that many state department liberals in the 50s were in fact communist agents in the 30s.  Facts such as that Native American lands were actually purchased.  Even more illuminating fact like that Miscegenation laws were originally passed to stop Slave masters from raping their slaves, not to stop black men from marrying white women as most slanderous articles now assume.<br /><br />This book brings back to life the real American history, the facts not that typical 'America is evil and everything American is bad' point of view of most high school teachers and most text books.  Finally illuminated is the wonderful spirit of Americanism, the individualism, freedom and special unique values that only America created, values that withstood fascism, communism, monarchism and finally triumphed over adversity.  These Judeo-Christian, Greek inspired values which so many today scoff at saved the world time and again and were the beacon to freedom fighters since 1776.  These values protected the independence of nations in the Americas while fighting colonialism abroad.  Read this book and you will be endowed with a new birth of freedom, that revisionists have tried so hard to stamp out.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-11-28

The author who grew up in Tunisia describes the hypothetical positions of the colonizer and the colonized, trying to discern what are the options open to them.  In this anlysis several important realizations are made, such that the left discourages terrorism at home but supports it when 'suppressed non europeans' engage in it.  But beyond a few insights the book lacks almost any grip on reality.  Certain platitudes are taken for granted, for exmaple \\"The colonized is presumed a thief\\".  or the colinizer is racist.  Or the colonized has no choice over his desinty and \\"is not a man\\".  But this is just not acurate for all colonial situations.  In many situations the native inhabuitants did retain many of their rights and their soviergnty, the Rajas in India might come to mind.  It may be true of Tunisia however which the book is coming out of, but little experience is given in the book, no facts are included as if the book applies to all situations.  Rather this book applies to the situation in the ALgeria and Tunisia, and that is about it.  Despite the vast generalizations, this book is mostly a museum piece of the kind of works that passed as 'academic' in the 1960s when anything that siad \\"Europe is evil\\" was gobbled up by the unsuspecting deluded public.<br /><br />Nevertheless The book makes many startling and suprisingly accurate preditions and critiques.  Of most importance is the illustration that most rebels against colonial governments in N. Africa became heavily relgiious, and the 'rebels' turned to religion and tradition as sources of pride.  Also revolutionary in this is account is the pointing out of the hypocrisy of the left and its relations with terrorism.  WOnderful points are made as the leftists of europe tried to straddle the question of why the 'good' anti-colonialist rebels became 'religious fanatics'.  The leftists shuddered when one of two points adopted at Bandung was religion, not simply freedom and communism as the left predicted.  Memmi's other works and his later statements regarding the situation of minorities under Islamic rule are sobering and honest.  This is a good introduction.<br /><br />Seth J.

Islamism is a direct reaction tot he west, employing western concepts like 'human rights' and such other odd ideas to then attack the west.  THe Islamic world was much more liberal and moderate before it came into contact with the west.  The current wave of terrorism and hatred is based much more on islamic reading and studying in the west then actually the original 'Islamic civilization' before contact with the west.  for instance the hatred  of 'womens rights' is more based on a hatred of the western woman, then it is the way Islamic women actually used to act.  The anti-semitism of modern islam is anothee aspect that was wholly stolen from the West.  The search for the 'real' islam is a waste and this book is correct in understanding the Islamism is merely a search, like communism, for a third way.  It is the wests coddling of Islam that has emboldened its most fanatic members, it is the lefts support of terrorism that created the 'left wing' terrorism that then transformed into militant Islamic terrorism, it is the wests self hatred that has made Islam hate the west.	2004-11-17

But it is hideously guilty of tunnel vision.  It seems to ignore a few essential points.  First of all America has always been involved in war somewhere almost from the day of creation.  Countless presidents sent American forces abroad, from Jeffersons war on the barbary pirates to Wilson's punitive expeditions against Pancho Villa Mexico.  How does one square this with the assessment found here that Bush's use of force is new and dangerous and somehow unprecedented.  Bush's war in Iraq is not unprecedented in terms of casualties.  It is unprecedented in terms of manpower perhaps and cost.  But America has invaded so many places so many times.  Who remembers the 30 year occupation of Haiti?  The thousands lost putting down Phillipino rebellion in 1900?  The hundreds lost fighting Sandino in Nicaragua.  And who remembers such interventions as LBJ's 1964 invasion of Dominican Republic.  This book suffers from tunnel vision.  It doesn't ever present he reader with a general list of the wars from 1789 to present that America embarked on.  Rather it focuses on Mr. Bush.  And while Mr. Bush is important, it seems to ignore the unilateral bombing campaigns enacted by Clinton against such disparate targets as Sudan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo and Bosnia, not including the interventions in Haiti and Somalia.<br /><br />If this were a  better study it would conclude that if a year doesn't go by without an American invasion somewhere then that wasn't a typical year and that the War on terror has more in common with the War against Japan then it does wit the interventions in the first Gulf War.<br /><br />Nevertheless this is a good book, by an eminent author and is a good contribution to the question of Bush, the War powers act and the American president as commander in chief.<br /><br />Seth J.

The backbone of the `evidence' is that a few people had Cell Phone that didn't work properly around the date of the crash.  The other evidence is simply better.  The FBI took two hours to get to the crash site, is this evidence that the FBI is simply lazy or that it was a conspiracy for them to take to long.  Rather the book argues two hours was a short time asking the question \\"How did they know to be so close\\".  Well by most standards 2 hours is a pretty long time for FBI to arrive at the scene of a dead congressional official.<br /><br />Lets examine the truth.  After Wellstones death the Democrats used the death to help get a Democrat elected, using the funeral service as a `bush bash'.  Later 69% of the states voters believed a `conspiracy' existed.  So did the death of Wellstone help or hurt the Bush administration?  It hurt the bush administration by turning Minnesota more liberal and keeping the Wellstone seat in Democrat hands.  So what is the conspiracy?  This book could just as easily insinuate that it was a democrat conspiracy to keep the Senate seat.  But instead the authors are ardent democrats who have a penchant for believing any theory.<br /><br />A few more pieces of `evidence' are just as laughable.  For instance `garage doors mysteriously' malfunctioned.  But don't garage doors always malfunction?  And better yet it is definably a conspiracy because someone from the NTSBV admitted they didn't know what caused the crash.  If every plane crash where a cause is unknown is a conspiracy then that means a whole bunch of other aviation accidents are part of some massive conspiracy, perhaps a conspiracy to keep man out of the sky and on the ground?  But the book if you want an insight into how convoluted and funny conspiracy theories are.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-11-17

Among topics is the women of the Kibbutz movement, women in the IDF, women as widows of war, women as rape victims and Sephardie and Arab women in Israeli society.  Many interesting women are discussed such as Israels first female general and a woman running for the Knesset.  It appears to be a good start, and for someone unfamiliar with Israel, unacquainted with Israeli women, it may seem to be a good text with which to understand Feminism and the so-called fake equality in Israel, after all the premise is that Israel is not as Equal as people say.<br /><br />Unfortunately this is just a fabrication.  Let us take the rape and domestic violence statistics.  The article would have you believe that since Arab women aren't reporting being raped then therefore there is no rape in Arab society in Israel, and a subsequent article would have one believe that the main quest of Arab women in Israel is to fight the Israeli `occupation'.  The reality is rapes are underreported among the arab minority in Israel, not that rapes simply don't take place.  The reality also is that Arab women are disproportionately non employed and cannot even find jobs in most Arab towns due to discrimination against them by fellow Arabs.<br /><br />Another huge lie in this book is the focus on the `Peace movement' of Israeli women.  But not one ounce of ink is devoted to women in Green an important movement demanding the terrorism be condemned.  Also not one page is devoted to asking the question \\"Why don't Palistinian women protest against terror in the same manner Israeli women protest against the army?\\".  These unresolved questions make this book a biased text.  In fact the text borders on racism when it hollers \\"exploding the Myth that Jewish men don't beat their wives\\".  Can one imagine the same sentence with `Jewish' replaced by `Arab'.  This is a racist, hateful compilation of diatribes against Israel which will only make the reader biased.<br /><br />Seth J.

Here is the book that delves into the psyche whereby a womans rights activist will also protest on behalf of the Taliban.  This is the text that explains how a left wing [...] rights activist will stand by the Saudi regime. This is the text that explains how the people at Human Rights Watch will stand by and watch genocide in the Sudan.  Here is the text finally, that will light the candle of light in the dark room where the deals are made between Bin Laden and Noam Chomsky.  Here Horowitz exposes, in the hard scrabble illuminating style that he is known for, the wonderful factual and strange bases of a left that is so lost it has embraced Militant Islam as its savior.<br /><br />Todays college campuses force students to read the Koran before attending classes, schools are told they must have `Islam week' where students enact `Jihad' against their classmates and female students are instructed to wear veils while the men enact the Hajj.  Here we see how the Liberals on campus distort the Koran, how they say `Jihad' means `love' and that `Dhimmi' means `equal' and that Islam is a `religion of peace' as if any religion is inherently peaceful.  Here we see how the Left eats up the lie hook-line-and-sinker and betrays its leftist roots whereby human rights and womens rights and tolerance had been its most sacred cows.<br /><br />A wonderful book for those that want to understand the insanity of today's media coverage and the bias of today's academics and the odd strange alliance that seems to have been carved out since Sept 11.<br /><br />Seth J.

Global warming is a problem.  Poverty is a tragedy.  Immigration is a fact.  A `war on want' would be nice.  But in order to fight the `war on want' one must first eradicate hatred, intolerance, racism, nazism, Islamism, communism, terrorism and all other types of -isms.  Throwing food at intolerant hateful people doesn't make the problem go away, it just makes them hungrier.  This book ignores fact and whitewashes the world.  England is not `caught between America and Europe'  rather England is being taken over by intolerance.  But it is intolerance towards the west that sweeps the world today.  See Immigrants don't have a `natural right' to immigrate where they please.  In fact the greatest threat today is that countries in Europe, namely Holland and France, will be overrun by immigrants in the next 20 years plunging the European continent into another dark age.  In order to fight the war on poverty that will supposedly solve all the worlds problems one first has to learn the lesson of the Marshall plan.  You have to first beat your enemy into submission before you raise him up in your image.  This was the approach used in Germany and Japan in 1945 and it has succeeded.  If this book were to have suggested this policy, it would be accurate, but simply throwing money at a problem only makes the problem worse, Africa is a showcase of this.  There are 50 times the amount of aid organizations in Africa today then in 1960, and yet Africans are poorer today.  How is that possible?  It is because of misguided ideas like these.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-11-17

Teller went from being a `madman on the Mesa' to working on theories surrounding star wars, called by many to be the `real Dr. Strangelove' from the wonderful Peter Sellers film.  This very readable account details Tellers life, from being a refugee to working alongside Oppenheimer and the rest of the Nuclear Bomb people at Los Alamos.  Teller went on to be the main architect and driver behind nuclear bomb technology and strategic warfare aims, all the way to the early 80s.  This is a fast paced biography with diagrams of the bombs and good explanations of the science involved as well as covering Tellers private life and social life.<br /><br />The only missing point which would have been nice is more explanation of the Tellers theories regarding nuclear power and the utilization of nuclear weapons.  Perhaps alongside the science it would have been nice to have more text devoted to the nuclear experimentation and this is the main part that makes the book seem to skip.  One minute the reader is listening to lecture the next he is learning about Tellers family and then suddenly we are back in Alaska on a new test, with very little background from one scene to the next.  Nevertheless the book remains the only and best book on Tellers life and detailing the American nuclear community as it matured in the 60s and 70s.

Always a fascination to the Whites he has seemed to embody all that was noble and all that was tragic in the fight of Lakota and the bigger fight of all native cultures against impending doom.  Crazy Horse, his dreams and his often strained relationships, his messianic nature, his young virile attributes, whether the victory over Custer, his murder by his own people, or his noble riding to surrender mounted proudly on a white horse.  AL the poetry of the west and the vanishing ways of the Lakota is presented here in a lively story telling of the life of Crazy Horse.  It is a needed contribution to the scant literature on this Indian leader and noble hero of the American west, who often seems more fiction then fact.<br /><br />But herein lies the problem.  Not much is really known about Crazy Horse, except that he participated in the defeat of Custer in 1876, he subsequently surrendered and was killed.  That is about it.  But their were tales, rumors, stories, oral traditions, some invented, some accurate and some embellished.  Anyone looking for a scholarly account should look elsewhere, this book is pure popular history bordering on a novel, but contained within it is the truth of the Lakota culture and the legend of Crazy Horse.<br /><br />Seth J.

Who does not at the same time fear the intolerance and racial problems, the famine and disease, while yearning for the bush?  This is the question so eloquently explored by a renowned travel writer in this tour de force that takes one from the dusty bazaars of Cairo to the Volk of South Africa.  The stories follows the famed Cape to Cairo route, starting in the Maghreb and heading South.  Passing the formidable fanaticism of the Sudan, the genocide in Darfur, to the ancient Christians of Ethiopia to such melting posts as Kenya and then south to the harshness of Zimbabwe and whence to South Africa.  From visiting the normal tourist destinations to seeing the people as they are this book gives a wonderful historical political look at the continent of Africa.  One question being asked is how has Africa changed since the idealism of the 1960s?  What is the role of the countless aid organizations?  What is the role of religion and race in society?  Without going into polemics but simply through gentle observation and slight off the hand remarks this book helps guide the reader through the vastness of Africa, the problems and the delights.<br /><br />The text refers to the  \\"Era of Charity\\" trying to stop the \\" ineradicable miseries: Famine, displacement, poverty, illiteracy, AIDs...\\"  the book explains how the massive dumping of foreign capital into Africa has simply turned problems into \\"permanent conditions\\"  and nothing is more honest an observation then from a former Peace Corps volunteer.  The text begs the question again and again `how is it possible that these African countries are poorer and less developed then in 1960, ney 1860?  How is it possible that only infrastructure in places like Khartoum is the remnants of the British?  And this is the essence of the title \\"Dark\\".  This is not a safari that shows one beautiful pictures, rather the reality is coaxed out of the continent, laid bare, and among the horrors, one discovers the simple humanity of Africa the enticements that led Joseph Conrad and the poet Rimbaud to seek the wafting smells of Injera.  What can be more enticing then wonderful travel writing on the words most diverse and sometimes most terrible place.

What does this mean?  Terrorism is alive and well in Russia, Nigeria, Sudan, Thailand, India, Philippines, Indonesia and Europe.  Terror training camps still exist.  Bin Laden is free.  Pakistan has nuclear weapons and Iran is making them.  Civilians heads are being cut off amid jeering on Al Jazeera.  If this is winning, then what is losing?  Although this book, like a few recent ones, claims that the secret hand of America is putting the `beat down' on terror, the evidence seems to be to the contrary.  Any reader of a newspaper can tell you that the world is full of terrorists on every continent, killing hundreds daily.  The problem is Americans tunnel vision on terror and inability to create a real world policy of containment against terror.<br /><br />One major gap in this book is thus:  Most of the 9/11 terrorists came from Europe, learned their hate and intolerance in Europe before being trained in Afghanistan.  So if America wants to `dismantle the terrorist infrastructure' then the front line is in Europe, not Iraq.  But this book doesn't seem to tackle these more disturbing growths of intolerance and hatred.  This book doesn't even address why America has been o far unable and unwilling to crush the insurgents in Iraq or find those what have beheaded so many civilians.  While it is nice and through this book one can, imagine that we are winning, the opposite is in fact true.  But the reader maybe interested in at least understanding some of the aspects of the war on terror that we are not aware of and the secret work being don't to stop terrorism.<br /><br />Seth J.

Apartheid was a system of racial segregation practiced in South Africa, a term like `Ethnic cleansing, that jumps from one conflict and is now used with haste to explain other conflicts and unjust behavior, in this instance Israel.  But Apartheid is a term that really invokes what happened in South Africa where 90% of the population was kept from the government, and given barely 17% of the land.  In South Africa everything was segregated, from hotels to toilets.<br /><br />This is in stark contrast to Israel where nothing is segregated, where Jews and Muslims live side by side and where the majority of the people also own a majority of the land.  In Israel all political parties are represented in the Knesset and although this book doesn't admit it, the Arabs have three political parties that have members of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.  So from the first page this book is Disingenuous to the topic.<br /><br />But beyond the fabrications in pretending that Israel in any way models South Africa one must delve deeper into the fabrications that exist in this text.  This book is honest in explaining that Israel was and is a Jewish state, for Jews and that the `Right of Return'  applied to those who had at least one Jewish grandparent.  What this book doesn't explain is that for this reason the law of return granted any persecuted Jew a place to go as a refugee,  something no nation had done for the millions of Jews trying to flee Germany in 1939.  Beyond these many fabrications or simply twisting of history this book also claims that 1948 was a `massacre'.  But the truth is the only massacre of the 1948 war in Israel took place in Gush Etzion where 150 Jews who surrendered where massacred by the Arab Irregular forces.  This of course is not mentioned and this book merely parrots the propaganda.<br /><br />This is a sad testimony to how history can be changed, how facts can be twisted and how pure propaganda can pass for academic scholarship.<br /><br />Seth J.

The problem the author addresses is how to blend the two cultures creating some sort of hybrid monster called Islamo-Christian civilization.  But the problem is that Islamo-Christian civilization already exists in Syria, Egypt and other places where Dhimmi laws keep the Christian in a state of perpetual fear while the Muslim is respected under the law.  What the book really means is to try to find an Islamo-Western path, whereby the extremes of Islamic religion can be grafted onto the modern humanist approach of the West.  Unfortunately, and this is the problem, this path cannot take place.  Anyone who has researched even in the most paltry manner, the civilization of Islam can see that Islam does not coexist and certainly does not allow itself to be grafted onto non-Islamic civilizations.  The West is no exception.  The west values freedom of speech, accuracy in history, self critique, and equality for women, such concepts that rarely exist in Islamic societies, concepts that are irreconcilable.  The Argument found in this book that Europe can be some sort of uber-testing ground where Islam is slowly absorbed and then combined with western thought simply is inaccurate and while it might work on paper or in the theoreticians lab it doesn't work among people.  Turkey is a perfect example of a country that tried to accomplish this feat, and with more or less successful result for 50 years.  But how did Turkey create an Islamo-Western society?  First it whipped out all minority groups, leaving a country 100% Islamic and then it brutally suppressed the religious muslims, with the result that today it is becoming more and more militantly religious.  Is this the path for Europe.  This book thinks it is although it wont admit it and this is where the major flaw in the reasoning emerges.  While this paints a nice utopian picture of coexistence, anyone who has studied Islam, should understand that this idea is false.  Nevertheless this book should be read to understand the rush of academics to welcome their coming Dhimmi status in Muslim Europe.  This is a definite contribution to the literature.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzmanhould understand that this idea is false.

From standing strong at Stones River and Perryville in the Western Campaign, to leading the Union Cavalry Corps against Lee and Stuart this wonderful biography puts the reader in the saddle for a tour de force of the Civil War.  Due to its slightly dated reading this book takes into account many controversies and topics that modern civil war writing seems to have forgotten.<br /><br />The wonderful account also covers Sheridan's post war career both as military governor of Louisiana and Texas and then onto his work on the frontier in pacifying the Sioux, Comanche and other tribes.  Custer's defeat is covered in detail as are the interesting careers of Custer and Crook in general, who led cavalry divisions alongside Sheridan in the Civil War.  Of most interest for veteran readers on the War is the interesting topic of Sheridan's involvement in supporting Benito Juarez in Mexico against the French as well as Sheridan's short attach&eacute; status with the Prussians in 1870 when they defeated Napoleon III outside Sedan.  This biography covers much ground and gives amazing insights into the characters as diverse as Grant, Sherman and even the Southern Gentry of the time.  The authors pugnacious personality comes through in the wonderful language and forgotten themes of this book, which gives one a refreshment from the Politically correct history of today.  A must read for Civil War Buffs and anyone interested in history.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-11-16

Here is a wonderful book the critiques Chomsky pointing out the many ways he has fabricated his sources over the years and has used hateful intellectual lies to turn subjects around, and make them seem acceptable.  Here we see the Holocaust Denial that Chomsky defends.  Here we see how Chomsky ignored the Cambodian genocide and supported the Soviets.  Here we finally have the limelight shined on Chomsky's obsessive hatred of America and Israel.<br /><br />But what is most wonderful and enlightening about this read is that finally the reader, who has long suspected that Chomsky is wrong or misleading, finally this book gives the read tools to argue against the Chomskists.  Here is simply a wonderful book that everyone will quickly consume due to it wonderful revolutionary nature of turning cherished sacred cows on their heads, showing that the `truth' of manufacturing consent is nothing more then the actual manufacturing consent.  Chomsky himself has manufactured Consent among the student masses, and then blamed the corporations for spewing the very propaganda which he is so excellent at.  Anyone one who dares question reality and anyone who is being seduced by Chomsky or the left must read this book to open their minds to intellectual freedom<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-11-16

But the very first page will make you realize just how important it is.  This is a plea, a loud call to save Israel before it is to late.  It is not the much maligned ignorant intolerant ranting that it is accused of.  Rather this enlightening work, written by hand and smuggled out of a Ramle prison, calls for the separation of the Arabs and Israelis as the only hope to a true and lasting peace.  Anyone who has been to Israel will understand that this is necessary.  But for those still taken in by what Kahane called the `myth'  of coexistence this book will explain in excruciating, terrifying detail the truth behind the coexistence of the 1920s and 30s, the endless riots and assaults on Jewish refugees and Jewish villages.  Separate chapters detail the transfer of Germans from Poland and Czechslovakia after World War Two, as well as enlightening paragraphs on the India-Pakistan transfers of 1948 and the transfer in Cyprus in 1974 and even among the Turks and Greeks in 1921.  But this book also tells the dismal stories of places where transfer did not take place such as Sri Lanka or Burma, where strife, hatred, intolerance and racism have resulted.<br /><br />Of course it is easy to label this book hateful, for most of us raised in the West it will seem incredibly intolerant and primitive, but this book understands the truth about how things really are in 90% of the world.  For anyone interested in the survival of Israel, for anyone wanting to understand the modern day Israeli right, and for anyone wanting a totally new view of the conflict this is a must buy.<br /><br />Seth J.

First this book gives a good introduction to morphing of Islamic terror and the rise of hatred for the `West\\" and particularly America.<br /><br />Little insight is given into history.  For instance how does one square the rise of fundamentalism with the rise of Arab nationalism?  Are they not two sides of the same coin?  The Muslims determination to confront the west and having seen the total failure of Nasserism, not embraces Fundamentalism.  Where is he context of the war inside the Muslim world between Seculars and Radicals?  What of the fact that every terrorist who created 9/11 was schooled in Europe and learned his hate from European finances and Saudi financed Imams?<br /><br />This book presents the fundamental flaw that America should be wasting its time `winning the hearts and minds of Muslims\\".  This book doesn't understand that the present conflict has nothing to do with winning hearts and minds, the very idea is in fact imperialistic.  Did America try to win the hearts and minds of Communists? Did America succeed in Winning the hearts and minds of the Nazis?  This book puts the blame on the `neo-conservatives soldiers blaming their obsession with `Israel' and `Oil'.  But is it not true that Sept 11 was planned long before the neo-con rise to power?  How does one square that incongruous argument?  The main failure of this book is its lack of historical depth and its lack of realizing that Islamic fundamentalist/Islamism is simply the logical outgrowth of society, a natural phenomenon, like the rise of Communism or Fascism, that takes place from time to time in a society where people perceive themselves as victims.<br /><br />Seth J.

Anyone who has worked in the middle east will be aware of the nature of how the world works here.  In examining Camp David and the 'fall' of the Peace Process it is not proper, to do as this book does, and simply accept that everyone is telling the truth and try to spread 'blame'.  he meeting at Camp David wasn't like Versailles, and one researching he meeting is not dealing with honest diplomats, rather one is dealing with people who have a deep vested interest in protecting their lives, the lives of their people and the lives of their holy sites.  How can anyone with such emotional ties be in the least bit trusted.  This book, if anything, serves as yet another example of how the conflict in the middle east is often simply fabricated based on the pre-conceived notions that people are inherently honest.  This is yet another addition tot he heap of \\"whose fault is it\\" literature on the Camp David meeting.  But placing blame doesn't solve the conflict.  It only deepens the intolerance.  Not a worthwhile read, accept for the middle east scholar, aware of complexities.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-10-31

Israel has fought 5 major wars, each one to secure its borders.  1948 was to create a country.  1956 was to stop the infiltration and prempt Egypt's growing army.  1967 was fought out of desperation, but led to the creation of a `Greater Israel'.  1973 was a defensive conflict, that almost proved a disaster.  1982 was fought to stop the shelling of the Galilee by a proto-Palestinian state in Lebanon.  The recent pseudo-conflicts of the First(1989-1992) and primarily the second Intifada(2000-present) have created new border issues, resulting in the construction of the security fence.<br /><br />Creveld fresh from his studies of the IDF and Dayan now uses his analysis in this fresh and insightful book to explain the question of defensible borders and how they relate to Israel today.  In 1948 any military tactician could see the borders `given' to Israel by the U.N and rejected by the Arab leadership, were indefensible.  The Arab state controlled the high ground, Israel the coastal plain.  Israel was roughly 9 miles wide, meaning the country could be cut in half in a days fighting.  But today, as Creveld points out, Israel has the best military in the Middle East, and perhaps the best in the world.  Israel's inventiveness have led to her developing of the Merkava tank and other weapons that could easily clean up the armies of her neighbors.  Beyond Israel's army are the peace treaties that at least on paper guarantee Israeli security against a renewal of the 1967 situation, the situation that caused the conquest of the West Bank and Gaza.  Today the threat is terror.  And terror, unlike the Germans, can actually be stopped by maginot line style defenses, listening posts, and other technology based infrastructure.  This book argues passionately, and intelligently that Israel's military solution should be a withdrawal to a line somewhere near the green line, that can be easily defended and yet leaves the majority of palistinians outside Israel, to fend for their own destiny.  This book does not ask hard questions, such as what to do with the 250,000 Israelis living in villages on the West Bank, but it does give a military solution.  An excellent, well thought out, non-emotional approach, this will be enjoyable reading for any student of the middle east conflict and anyone wanting to understand one path to peace.<br /><br />Seth J.

Forced to flee many of its members still harkens back to their times in Iraq, with fond memories of a Jewish community that had been deeply intertwined with the life of Iraq.  The Jewish community of Iraq was the oldest in the world, stretching back to Abraham, who came from modern day Iraq and of course including the Babylonian exile as well as the great Sages who wrote the Talmud.  This wonderful reminiscence of a time gone by and an era gone is a wonderful introduction to the lives of Jewish communities from Arab lands, and a great testimony to the Iraqi Jewish community and its legacy.<br /><br />Seth J.

France has long been the beacon of independence and it has bequeathed much to this world.  THis book, however, examines the more sordid, arrogrant and anti-american policies of France.  Long an idealistic people France has become increasingly hateful of America, mostly becuase of Frances jealousy over being saved by America in so many places.  Its not just an irony that France wanted to bill the American troops for 'staying on French soil' during World War Two, rather it is part of a concerted effort by France to always obsess over pride when gratitude should be number one.<br /><br />This tells the intimate details fot he Frnaco-American relationship.  From Lafeyette to the XYZ affair, to Lousiani purchase through to WOrld War Two, Dienbien Phu, LAgeria and the latest scraps over Saddam.  In the end the conflcit with France boils down to France wanted to be a Great Power but remaining merely a regional power of little or no importance, overshadowed even by its erstwhile neighboors England and Germany.

This book is not a feminist anthology on Palisitnians on the west bank, rather it is a feminist-nationalist book on the Arab women living in Israel.  It looks partly at the ideas of modernization among arab/muslim women in Israel and tries to look at the varying way that women are used in the nationalist anti-Israel movement.  One method is examining birth rates.  In order to `modernize' the Arab women they are encouraged to marry older and have less children.  But a second nationalist strain encourages them to have more children in order to `out breed' the Jewish population.  It is an interesting study.  A very biased book which frequently replaces the word `Jew' with the word `zionist'  but it is also the only book of its kind on the issues confronting Arabs in Israel, especially women.  Unfortunately there is little focus on the status of women in Arab society, rather the book looks at women as a tool to confronting Israel and how the Arab community uses women in this manner, thus it examines the status of women in Israeli society.  But unfortunately although this is supposed to be a feminist text, it comes off as very nationalist, not analyzing problems associated with women in muslim communities, particularly the phenomenon of `Honor Killings' and other issues, such as the education of women are availability of abortions.  An interesting book, a good contribution to literature on Israel, but one must read it with a questioning eye.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-10-27

FIrst of all it fails to make a disinction between religion and ethnicity.  China has both religious and ethnic minorites, although these do not always go hand in hand.  But in order to appease the left this book works hard to show that 'muslims' are being suppressed and defined racially as 'others'.  But one must find it hard to beleive that the book ignores the persecution of chinese christian, merely because devoting any time to such a subject wouldnt make it readable to the anti-christian sorts who enjoy books on minorities.  Unfortunatly this is the great flaw here.  The Book totally ignores the actual ethnic minorities of china in order to create a fake ethnic minority of the Hui, who are in fact Chinese.  The real ethnic minorities exist along Chinas borders, in Tibet, Xinjiang and other places. A tregedy of a book that had greatness in its grasp.  China is a country with many minorities, but this book shows the ultimae flaw of trying to creat minorities out of thin air and then trying to apply western ideas such as 'racism' onto and asia society where such ideas are either foreign or nonsense.<br /><br />Seth J.

In its sheer breadth of knowledge it covers a vast array of questions from pre-emptic strikes to the status of civilians and the question of responsibility.  WOnderful discussions on all aspects fo waging war from blockades, to the question of appeasement.  A very fascinating read with several minor flaws.<br /><br />THe first major flaw is the preoccupation of this book with western conflicts.  Major wars, with millions of dead, have been waged in this century alone that did not involve the west, for instance the Iran-Iraq war.  Little analysis in this study is given to the question of a non-western perespective on war and what it means for western nations confronting non-western ones, who live by completely different rules.<br /><br />THe second major flaw is the all to often obsession with treating terrorism without mentioning Islam.  In the chapter on terrorism and guerilla war their is a disproportionate focus on the IRA and the 'Stern Gang' which would make one assume that these organizations were disproportionatly good examples of terrorism.  The opposite is true.  Not one sentence, in fact not one word in this study deals with Islamic terrorism, which just happens to be the main confict in the world today.  THe question of 'just wars' was obviously aimed at the recent Iraq war, so why not deal with the question of Sept 11?  FLaws such as this point to an overreaching political correctness which takes away from this volumnes very heroic attempt to understand modern war.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-10-27

Here we see a society where the men go out at night and party and dress as they please while the women are harnessed to do the house work and have up to 20 children and meanwhile dress in ungodly amounts of clothes in the name of `modesty' in a climate where tempetures reach into the 100s.  So while the men are at the local bar in t-shirts the women are laboring with the sheep and keeping their eyes down, lest they be beaten and killed in an `honor killing' which is neither a killing, nor honorable, but rather a barbaric murder.<br /><br />Yet the terrible poetry of this book does not explain one final facet, which is that this society is duly supported, funded and has been largely created by the United Nations.  This Palistinian society used ot be more progressive and even had many communists, until the UN began doling out handouts.  Then we see that in places like Gaza honor killings are actually subsidized by the UN and women are allowed to be `sold' by their parents, all under the watchful guise of the UN which was sopposed to be teaching them about womens rights and such modern concepts.  A tragedy made worse by the misguided policies of the west.  While the women next door in Israel are enjoying freedom of expression and freedom to vote and dress as they please, women in Gaza and Jordan and the rest of the UN mandated areas are being enslaved and suppressed.<br /><br />Seth J.

The story travels from the Copts of Egypt, to the Maronites of Lebanon and then onto the Christians of Israel and Jordan.  Because the story tries to follow in the steps of Jesus, it ignores the Christians of Syria, Iraq and other Arab countries.  But this does not take away from this book, which is a wonderful one of a kind contribution to the slim reading on the Christians of Arab lands.  The Copts number about 5 million and make up less then 2% of Egypt.  Similar percentages are given from the Christians of Israel(including the West Bank) and Jordan.  Lebanon by contrast is almost half Christian.  Each of these countries now has a huge Christian diaspora, numbering in the millions, a Diaspora the unlike the Palestinians who live in UN supported refugee camps, has gone unnoticed and uncared for.  Not one penny of UN money was ever spent to help the Copts of Egypt, who as one reading this book will see, are subjected to persecution, assaults and humiliation on a daily basis.  The most startling revelations in this book concern the Christian community of Nazareth, where radical islamicists hijacked the Israeli court system to allow for a monstrous mosque to be built on a so-called Islamic holy place, a direct assault on the humble Christian community that lives in the town of Jesus.  This book is also an amazing account of the lives of the Christians who have equally suffered from the 2nd Intifada(2000-present) where they are caught in the middle between Palestinian terrorists and the Israeli defense forces.  Here we see the quiet community of Biet Jalla, destroyed when 3000 palistinian gunmen occupied it and a fierce gunbattle with Israeli tanks resulted.  Here we see the sad story of the Maronites, who helped create arab nationalism only to see it used against them as they were ethnically cleansed from Lebanon.

When the ten northern tribes of Israel were gobbled up they became `Lost' and for more then 2000 years people have been speculating as to their whereabouts.  This book traces the development of the `myth' of the Lost tribes, trying to show the various claims and hoaxes that have struggled to `discover' the tribes.  Tracing this history from the New World to China, India, Africa and beyond the author shows expertly how missionaries and later Jewish researchers came to regard certain tribal peoples as descendants of the ancient Hebrews.  The major flaw here is that this is a fascinating subject which this book actually makes boring.  Here is a subject encompassing all the world and hundreds of interesting tribes with varying customs and traditions, many of which have been manufactured to appear Jewish in origin.  Some of these tribes are practicing circumcision whereas some were shown to have merely `Jewish countenance'.  This book immediately disregards that the Ten Tribes even exist, which obviously ethnically they probably do, although they probably are no longer Jewish.  Who is to say the Bedouin or the Kurds are not some ethnic remnant of the Tribes of Israel?  This book also makes dull a subject by focusing inordanently on the claims of various Baptist missionaries rather then going out and researching and describing the actual tribes themselves.  SO while this is a great new addition to the last tribes literature it is by no means an enjoyable read.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-10-25

Chaim Herzog was among a very fascinating family that included the Chief Rabbi of Israel in the 40s.  Chaim himself served in numerous posts, finally becoming President of Israel in the 80s.  This narrative covers every aspect of Israeli history from its high points to its low ones.  Chaim has been central to every major event in Israeli history, from the siege of Jerusalem in 1948 to the Ethiopian airlift.  His smart, to the point, autobiography pulls no punches in its incisive critique of Israeli society today and the mirror of the past.  For instance he takes to task such luminaries as Golda and Dayan, while criticizing the rise of `fundamentalism' in Israeli society, painting a not so pretty picture of today's Yeshiva attitude towards serving in the IDF.  He explains how the Rabbinate was actually more liberal in the 1940s then it is today.  This is a wonderful tour de force on Israeli history, from someone who was central to Israeli policy for year.  Not an apologists account, Chaim equally praises Ariel Sharon for his Unit 101 strategies as well as Peres for his inventive ideas.  Probably no one in modern Israeli society could be so unbiased as to see the vital gifts that both Sharon and Peres have given to Israel.  A must read for anyone interested in Israel or the modern political situation in the middle east.	2004-10-25

Unlike some of these similar books, Carmen Bin Laden has both kept her name and is not `fearing for her life'.  It is not clear why but for some reason she has also had an easy time keeping her children and educating in a normal manner away from the fascist ideology of Saudi culture.  This is yet another `insiders' account of what its like to be a western woman trapped in the arab world.  The irony here is that like ALL similar accounts the writer takes NO personal responsibility for her actions and the decisions that got her into this mess.  Although the book is honestly critical and rightly skewers the 12th century style society of Saudi Arabia,  it doesn't seem to ever ask the question \\"perhaps being swept off my feet by an exotic man is not what it seems?\\".  Even when she catches her husband cheating on her she doesn't dare to wonder \\"Is Islam perhaps a contraction, its obsession with keeping women veiled while the men violate every verse of the Koran?\\".  When the author describes her abortion she also doesn't seem to see the hypocrisy in living in an ultra-religious country in a fundamentalist society where everyone is busy forcing their wives to have abortions, participating in orgies and drinking themselves to bed every night, contravening the exact laws that supposedly are soooo important.  This is simply a sad account of someone who should have known better, but apparently, due to the massive volume of literature on this topic, no one seems to have learned since the 1970s, when these kinds of books began appearing, that living in Saudi Arabia, or Egypt, or Iran, is like living in a primeval world where women have less value then a car and less rights then a dog.  But, if this book is any indication, we will be seeing the same story played out for the next hundred year, until Wahhibism triumphs, or is extinguished.  A good read if you haven't already read the dozen other likeminded book.

This book explains that rather then simply seeing the world as a clash of civilization, rather each region can be carved up and explained and conflicts understood within the regional framework.  While this approach works nice on paper, it also contains a few obvious problems.  While it is true that most relations in Asia are regional and certainly don't extend into Africa and that the world has lost its bi-polar nature since the fall of the Soviets, it is also true that certain transnational movements such as Islam, do in fact extend beyond region.  For instance, this book sees Afghanistan as an `insulator' keeping Asia(India)  away from the middle east.  So for this book the Pakistan-India conflict is simply a regional outgrowth of two regional powers.  Realism would seem to agree.  Yet the truth is that Pakistan fanned the flames of Islamic fundamentalism all across Asia  and Turkey is once again dabbling in pan-Turkism in central Asia, even stretching to the Uigurs of China.  These phenomenon's, not to mention the presence of Arab volunteers in Chechnya and Bosnia, seem to contract the thesis here.  Nevertheless this book is a wonderful framework where regions such as Africa(sub Saharan) and South America(an underconflictual region) and be seen to have transformed themselves in the post-cold war world.  A book of interest to anyone trying to understand international relations in the coming century.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-10-25

As with most book on Poor Henry VIII, the women get center stage, ignoring, but not totally, the extraordinary events of the Tudor ruler.  Nevertheless this book is sure to be, along with Wier's and Frasers, the staple on the six wives.  Catherine of Aragon and he divorce deservedly devour half  the book, but important details are given on Parr and Anne of Cleves.  This book is not for the expert or the tried English Historian, rather it is a good weekend read of popular history.<br /><br />Although roundly accused of not writing a `history', only the most snobbish and elitist have been able to condemn this eminently readable account.  Those keen on finding grammatical errors may do well to stay away since this book is not of the scholarly nature, but rater reflects the refined English tastes of relaxed fine literature.<br /><br />The only real downside is that very little context is given to Henry's ambitions or the ambitions of his many powerful councilors.  But alas, it is a wonderful history of the Six Wives that makes this all the less necessary.<br /><br />Seth Frantzman	2004-08-10

From its early beginnings in Marx's study to the fall of the Berlin wall and the remaining `mastodons' of N. Korea and Cuba.  This book tells the amazing story of Mao's long march, the fall of Portugals empire in Africa, the rise of Eurocommunism and may other fascinating stories.  With the typical whit and insght, and unbiased touch of an Englishman, this book storms through communisms many victories, following it through a time when over half the worlds populaton was under the communist ethos and looked like Marx's dialectic might actually be the new way.<br /><br />But as this wonderful popular study points out, Communism was rotten from the core.  Every country where Communism succeeded, it suppressed civil liberties, stymied the economy and used nationalism to whip up support.  Missing slightly from this eminently readable account are the most unstudied communist movements in Africa and S. America.  Although dealt with, these movements are brushed over, with frequently but a page being donated to the communist victories in Ethiopia and the rebel movements like the `Shining Path' in Peru.  With the exception of these minor issues this book is a wonderful history of Communism.  Not an academic work, it doesn't bore one with the details of analytical thinking, rater it tells he true history, with special honesty given to Allende's regime in Chili.  A must read for anyone interested in the 20th century.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-08-10

With the end of World War Two in 1945 Europe's right wing was cleansed, and even made illegal in some European countries, like Germany  It was the right wing parties that had plunged Europe into war and subsequently been involved in Genocide.  For 50 yeas he right wing disappeared from the European political landscape, replaced by strong Communist and Socialist parties and `Christian Democrats'.  Then suddenly in the 1990s every European country except Germany and England saw a massive resurgence of right wing parties.  From Jorg Haider in Austria to Berlusconi in Italy, to Le Pens successful second place finish in France.  In Denmark and Belgium national parties like Fortyns came to preimence as well.<br /><br />The rise of this new respectable European right, washed of its fascist past, is told in flowery, loquacious verbage by an excellent journalist.  This book is very biased, as clear by the title.  But the bias should not get in the way of thos seeking to learn more about this fascinating phenomenon.  Here we see how the right wing has developed in different countries.  From holocaust deniers to the very accurate leaders who claim correctly that Europe is being taken over and subjugated by immigrants, this book details all the leadership and appeal of the new right.<br /><br />Unfortunatly not enough attention is paid to Eastern Europe, Russia or the rise of Islamic fundamentalism.  Zhirinovskie's nationalist party and Lukashenko of Belarus, along with the Croatian nationalists are not given enough attention.  Neither is Franco or Portugal's recently fascist governments given much  coverage.  The other main drawback is the authors unwillingness to shed light on the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Europe, a clearly right wing political force.  Because this book is trying to paint all of Europe's right as being racist or anti-immigrant their is little criticism given to the true Extreme Right wing of Europe, the ultra-religious immigrants who have overrun parts of Europe, and thus led to this backlash.  Although Anti-Semitism is talked about in detail, very little is written on the fact that this is related directly to Europe's immigration problems.  But all in all this book is essential for anyone trying to understand Europe today.<br /><br />Seth J.

As early as the 1980s some qustoned whether Arafat was a Terrorist or a 'Peacemaker'.  Here we see the definitive truth.  We see how while Barak was trying to give 97% of the West Bank and Gaza to the PLO, Arafat worked behind the scenes to loose Hamas bombers against Israeli civilians.  We see how Arafat engineered the so-called Al Aqsa martyr attacks and how he has always wanted no peace.  THis book is excellent in uncovering the turth and showing that even as Rabin and Peres worked for peace, the PLO girded for war, and even as Barak was giving in to all Arafats sopposed requests, that bombing of Israeli civilians were being planned and executed.<br /><br />This book will help anyone understand the true nature of the Israeli-Palistinian conflict.<br /><br />Seth J.

But the truth is that Fascisms real successes were in Italy and Spain where it stemmed the tide of uncontrolled anarchism and communist subversion to create a proletarian corporate state.  Although Fascism is now synonymous with evil, this was not so in Italy, where today's Italian party includes a coalition of Italy's old fascist party.<br /><br />This wonderful much needed book examines Mussolini and although it pulls no punches in detailing Italian atrocities in Ethiopia and Mussolini's weakness to stand up to Hitler this book also widely and accurately praises Mussolini by offering a sobering honest account of his life.  Usually the Italian dictator who came to power in 1922 is dismissed as a buffoon and a clown.  But this book shows positively that this is not case.  Mussolini called on the veterans of WWI to stand up for themselves by refusing to be spat on in public and he called on the nation to stop the flirtation with international socialism and instead become a nationalist productive beacon.  His movement condemned the parasites of society, but unlike the Nazis, these parasites were not outlines by race or religion, rather they were parasites who came from all classes and embodied the ethic of the professional bureaucratic communist, those who never worked but who were professional strikers and politicians, living off the backs of proletariat to create a new dictatorship where the proletariat would be enslaved as it was in Russia.<br /><br />Here we see how Mussolini went from being a dedicated socialist to apply his ideas to a new movement.  And we see the inner workings of the Italian state under fascism, at peace with Europe until Hitler dragged it into WWII.  No punches are pulled.  This book details Mussolini's vast secret police forces and his failures as well as his insane obsessions.  But a fair assessment is made, especially in analyzing Mussolini's half hearted defense of Italian Jews and his efforts to never allow one concentration camp on Italian soil, which is why not one Jew was ever deported until after the Nazis took over Italy in 1943.  This book reminds us that Mussolini's greatest influences had been Socialism and in particular two Jewish women, titans of Italian socialism, which is why it has been a tragedy that Mussolini has gone down in history as no more then Hitler's goon, which he certainly was not from 1922 to 1943.<br /><br />A round defense of Italian fascism and an excellent biography.  Anyone interest in the alternative fascisms of Spain and Italy, will enjoy this book as will anyone interested in Italian politics and  society or WWII.<br /><br />Seth J.

Fir instance the Lavon affir is not mentioned and neither is Elie Cohen, the Israeli spy who was Asads left hand man.  Also their are several odd misfactuals.  For instance we are told that one mossad agent grew 'curly' side locks to imitate an Orthodox Haredi in a few 'weeks'.  This is pure nonsense, becuase Paellas, the sidelocks take years to grow.

The problem here is mostly that the book ignores all the islamic atrocities and anti-european sentiments among islamic scholarship while emphasising every inch of anti-muslim or intolerant writing done by Europeans.  A heavily documented history of the anti-muslim manuscipts published in this book pretends to illustrate that it was Europe that was intolerant when in fact it was Islam that was on the offensive occupying Europe from 700AD through the 1800s.  So how is it possible that it was all Europe that was intolerant when it was europe that was invaded, enslaved, persecuted and attacked for so long?

Here we are able to divest ourselves from the emotions sourounding the conflict by changing the names to protect the innocent and there bye we see how the conflict truly works.  We see the truth behind the kinnewikans and how their 'brother' earthlings forced them into squalor and then conspired to make it seem like they were the victims when the truth is that the entire earth waged a fascist war against the Minervans only to be beaten back time and again, and yet in the end we see how propoganda and lies are able to twist the truth so that the true victims, the Minervans, become the oppressors, in the eyes of the media and the actual baby killers, the terrorists, are called heroes and 'human rights activists'.  This book is so amazing that its actually true and it will make you shudder when you realize such injustice takes place daily in the press and the news and how events and history is twisted by lies and propoganda so that people no longer see the truth.

Beginning the way most histories should, it describes a quick review of Iraqi history, from ancient times to Saddam.  An overview is given of the short British occupation, and of the development of the various groups of Shia, Sunni and Kurdish Iraqis.  Then the book shifts into a short biography of Saddam, describing his tribal roots and the roots of the Ba'ath party of Iraq.<br />Finally the book moves on to cover the `wars of Saddam' against Iran, the Kurds and Kuwait, culminating in the first Gulf War.  With this wonderful background the reader is given a fascinating insight into the second Iraq war by someone who reported during it.  Keegan seeks to address the fundamental question of how the war was not only different but also `mysterious' in its nature.  How did the Iraqi army, which  numbered 300,000 men, simply melt away?  Although the Iraqis possessed plenty of military hardware in artillery and Armor, it was mostly found abandoned and the army didn't even make a stand in Baghdad where the western press had anticipated a `Stalingrad on the Tigris'.<br />Te may end up as the seminal book on the war.  Easily discernable maps point out the development of Iraq as a country and the subsequent positions of the military units on the eve of war.  The later chapters detail the hunting of Saddam and his regime officials following the end of large scale hostilities.  The only think lacking is the fact that the guerilla war still simmers in Iraq, and it doesn't give any real coverage to Al-Sadr or the other recent flare-ups in rebellion.<br />Seth J.

Frequently the shortest pieces by men like Podhoretz could do more in the way of explaining conservativism and its attributes then ten book such as this.  Partly this is because although this book claims to be `unbiased' their sis certainly a bias in the sense that the authors confront American conservatism as if it is some sort of strange item, as if they are examining an ancient culture like an anthropologist.  The reader almost finds wanting a short \\"I have conservative friends\\" to buoy the authors acceptance that conservative are a legitimate force.<br />The main claim and direction in this book is trying to figure out how Conservative thought came to `dominate' American politics and how America became a `far more conservative' nation then it had been.  The problem here is that neither statement is true.  The Conservative movement may have been a reaction to out of control government and rampant social engineering liberalism but it was only a reaction by the vastly silent majority.  In the old days this book claims the nation wasn't proclaiming itself conservative, but this is simply because conservative thought was de facto the way of life.  Conservative nuclear families were the norm and church going was typical. By the 1970s their was a vast movement to turn the accepted way of life on its head.  Conservatism, as embodied by Goldwater, was the reaction of the majority saying \\"wait a sec, aren't we the norm?\\".  So the claim here that these `radical' reactions like Christian radio, Rush Limbaugh, Prayer at cabinet meetings or a university for homeschoolers is some sort of radical reversal, ala the Iranian revolution, taking America into the Puritan dark ages is just not literary honesty.  The reality is that in the 50s no one would have noticed a prayer at a cabinet meeting, schools taught what conservatives considered `normal values' and radio shows like Limbaugh weren't needed because his views were the accepted viewpoint in the media.  When the media and education systems changed the conservatives found themselves out in the cold and created their own education systems to rebel against the liberalism they saw being shoved down their throats.  This book, although detailing all these facts, doesn't seem to understand that Conservativism is simply a reversion to traditional values.<br />Yet this book, for its shortcomings, is a good analysis of the conservative way of life and the rise of conservative power.  Certainly this book opens up the alliance between southern democrats and hawk democrats like `Scoop' Jackson, along with the Paleo-conservatives who struck down the eastern liberal wing of the Republican party led by Nixon and Rockefeller.  This book does not delve into the main break between neo-conservative thought and Goldwater/Taft conservativism, but this is simply another small oversight.

This is the most interesting revelation that comes from this study.  Before Israel the Palestinians were a group of Bedouins, Druze, immigrants, Nouvo riche families(Nashashibis) and effendis(Husaynis).  Palestine had been an Ottoman backwater.  In the beginning it was grafted onto Jordan.  But today's Palestinians don't think of themselves as Jordanian.  This is an irony since in 1948 it was not the Israel that invaded Palestinian lands but rather the Egyptians and Jordanians that `occupied' Palestine from 1948-1967.  In a sense the true identity of Palestine came about only after 1967 in the opposition to being government by Dhimmis or non-Muslims.  It was at this point that the Palestinians, who had no real identity, suddenly found themselves, in opposition.  Arafat, a minor character, gained fame among the refugees and the rest is history.  Now the Palestine `identity' has tried to graft itself onto the Israeli-Arabs, especially the Bedouins and Druze who support Israel because they were suppressed by the `Palestinians' and their fellow Arabs by being denied land.  This is an ironic identity, almost as amazing as the Zionist creation of a `New Jew' identity in the 1930s.  If anything this book is a testament to how history can be invented, and how people who had no idea they belonged to a political unit 60 years ago suddenly feel like `brothers' due to their shared experiences.

The actual title should be 'Two lands, one people' since that is the actual reality today.  Their were never actually two peoples in the same land, even in the much maligned and reviled 'Mandate' period.<br />Of course, typically, this book frames the conflict as one between 'Jews and Arabs' when their are many more layers to the fabric of the diverse mosaic that is the holy land.  Their were inter-Jewish struggles of Revisionists against Zionists against the Orthodox.  And within the Palestinian camp their are equal divisions between the Bedouin, the fundamentalists, the socialists and the effendis.  Not to mention the Druze.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-05-24

If the thesis were true then America would have already taken over the UAE, and Kuwait and Saudi.  The reality is that America has no interest in colonization, only stability.  If stability in the region requires dumping some dictators and invading some countries then that is going to be a fact in the world, as long as America is the Hegemon.  But unlike the English America has no interest in governing people, especially people as savage as the Afghanis.<br />This book tries to pretend that a new imperial age is being opened up where America and England will once again become astride the world.  The fact is that the only countries to try to colonize the middle east recently were the Soviets.  In fact America has time and again supported the indigenous religions of the Middle east, allowing the Saudis to become a semi-fascist Sharia state and aiding the Jihad in Afghanistan while allying with the Islamist Zia in Pakistan.  America has time and again saved Middle eastern nations, whether it was pressuring Israel to sign cease fires or helping the Turks invade Cyprus or supporting Pakistan against India and defending Kuwaiti Autonomy America has actually helped Middle eastern states colonize non-Muslim states such as Cyprus and Lebanon.  This is the reality.  Unfortunately this book is in the theme of all those who use `new imperialism' as an excuse to preach hate and intolerance of the west and as an excuse to attack the west.<br />Seth J.

This first person account is an excellent story of one many struggle to redeem the American Indian and stand up to oppressive or unjust government policies, put in place not only by the BIA but also by fellow Native leaders like Dick Wilson at Pine Ridge.<br />Anyone fascinated with the rise of AIM and its actions will enjoy this fast paced account which rivals Means own autobiography.  Banks tells of his `exile' at Onandaga and his flight from federal authorities, as well as his leadership in many causes.<br />There are several flaws unfortunately.  Banks gives almost no background on the many native tribes whose causes he championed.  Even the Ojibwa culture is not given in much detail.  Also a major drawback is the total lack of any maps.  The AIM movement was a national movement representing tribes throughout America and demonstrating at many key reservations and yet we are not given any maps showing the mosaic of reservations.  The siege of wounded knee with its many geographic descriptions and military confrontations is also not given a map, which makes it difficult to understand just how the action took place.  Nevertheless this book should not be faulted for it is a true gem and a wonderful relic of a bygone age, when Natives found their spirit to retrieve themselves from many government programs that infringed on their way of life, told by one of its leading participants.<br />Seth J.

Banks tells of his `exile' at Onandaga and his flight from federal authorities, as well as his leadership in many causes.<br />There are several flaws unfortunately.  Banks gives almost no background on the many native tribes whose causes he championed.  Even the Ojibwa culture is not given in much detail.  Also a major drawback is the total lack of any maps.  The AIM movement was a national movement representing tribes throughout America and demonstrating at many key reservations and yet we are not given any maps showing the mosaic of reservations.  The siege of wounded knee with its many geographic descriptions and military confrontations is also not given a map, which makes it difficult to understand just how the action took place.  Nevertheless this book should not be faulted for it is a true gem and a wonderful relic of a bygone age, when Natives found their spirit to retrieve themselves from many government programs that infringed on their way of life, told by one of its leading participants.	2004-05-24
657151:US	51065232	RN0FHUUMEUHCQ	0743250281	873169967	How Israel Lost: The Four Questions	Books	4	22	37	N	N	A deeply probing account	Four simple questions are given in this book.  Why A Jewish State?  Why no Palestinian State?  Why do we care?  Why is their no peace?  The book then precedes to answer these questions.  Many characters are brought in and many characters are quickly glossed over with aside comments, such as Tommy Lapid.  References are made to infamous statements such as `break their Bones' by Mr. Rabin.  A whirlwind of information is sifted through, presupposing either that the reader is knowledgeable or gullible about the subject.  And this is where the `evidence' and the argument begins to unravel.<br />The major drawback of this kind of book is that it gives the arm chair  `I could solve that' interpretation of events.  Although background is given and fair shirking is given to both sides, for instance admitting that the Palestinian protests are over-emotional and the `human rights' groups predictably overreact, there is still a slight bias against Israel.  Unlike \\"Right to Exist' this book presupposes certain elements that are not entirely accurate. For instance the argument about peace is boiled down to `Why didn't Barak give that three percent back' as if allowing the Palestinians stewardship over the Temple Mount would bring peace or tranquility, which it would not.<br />As for the whirlwind tour through why Israel exists and why we care the book is perhaps more fair.  The idea that Israel is a `bulwark of imperialism' is quickly debunked.<br />But in the end one is left with a real feeling of pedestrianism with this read.  For Israel enthusiasts or those familiar with the conflict and its many sides this book will not add much kindling to the fire.  For those looking for an introduction `Case for Israel' or `Right to Exist' is a good companion to this volume.  As another viewpoint in the literature on the conflict this is certainly a welcomed addition.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-05-24

The Main thrust here is examining not just `who we are' but also who is trying to tear us down.  For instance it is pointed out that the people most actively hating American history and values are those at the top levels of academia.  Those who refer to the founders as `dead white men' are the most celebrated professors.  Protestant values such as rebellion, individualism and protest are seen as relics, while the communist international is seen as progressive.  In the same light America is now being told to embrace Sharia Islamic law far more then she is told to embrace any of her traditional Judeo-Christian roots.  America is more influenced by the voices of fascist intolerance then the tolerance and `rights of man' delineated in the constitution, a document under attack daily by the courts and institutions.<br />In effect this wonderful study shows a nation under siege.  Unlike the European protestants the American protestants had no history of suppression under a theocracy and thus although church power was curtailed the nation was not revolting against an all powerful church, rather the constitution made for freedom of religion.  This value of democracy and questioning extremism was what guided Washington's hand.  It was more the Spartan agrarian equality that influenced Jefferson then the opulent arrogance of Athens.  But in this day and age where Near Eastern Studies is given pre-eminence over American History at Universities and Public schools America is suffering from a two pronged offensive of Communistic socialism and Sharia law Islamism.  And increasingly it is not the new immigrants from Latin America that threaten our national identity but rather the elites who hate and insult their country at every turn.<br />As shown in this book it is clear that many of the academic anti-Americans would have been happy in Saudi Arabia or Nazi Germany or Stalin's Russia, then they are happy with American values.  Here we see a final call for Americans to remember their roots, their special roots which for so long took immigrants with histories of persecution and turned them into American citizens, rather then today when immigrants are intentionally left behind, intentionally not trained in English and intentionally forced to keep ties with their native lands rather then retain a new American identity that so many yearn for.<br />And excellent one of a kind read.<br />Seth J.

It deals with three conflicts, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia.  The claim with Iraq is that America encouraged Saddam to invade Kuwait and then conspired to starve Iraq and assassinate Saddam, in the end America simply took over Iraq.  The truth is that Saddam chose to invade his neighboors.  First he choose to invade Iran, then he choose to Gas the Kurds and finally because of jealousy he invaded Kuwait.  The sanctions were approved by the U.N and they didn't work anyway.  Saddam used the Oil for food program to get billions for new weapons.<br />Yugoslavia may be one of the only conflicts that this book is slightly accurate in portraying.  IN Yugoslavia the government reacted against terrorism and in doing so the international community claimed `ethnic cleansing'.  In a brutal war America bombarded civilians in Serbia and then invaded Kosovo, helping to finish the cleansing of Serbs from the province and supporting terrorists.  Here the book is on the mark.<br />In the last analysis the Afghanistan conflict this book is so far off the mark as to amaze anyone.  The Taliban destroyed thousand year old Buddhist statues, they stoned women to death for daring to leave the house alone, they made music and cinema illegal.  IF ever their was a regime that never deserved to exist it was the Taliban.  Most of the Taliban were not even indigenous Afghans, but foreigners who invaded Afghanistan in the 80s to fight the `Jihad' against the Soviets.  In the end the war against the Taliban was as just as the war against Nazi Germany.  This book may well be so extremist as to argue that fighting Nazism was also wrong and therefore it may not even be worth flipping through.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-05-21

First that America caused Saddam and then plotted to starve his country and remove him from power.  Second that 'the west' conspired to ruin the oil for food program.  But neither of these main avenues of assault are accurate in the least bit.  First of all Saddam actually took power himself, Saddam chose to invade Iran using Soviet supplied weapons, Saddam chose to gas the Kurds and Saddam chose to invade Kuwait.  How is it that America gets blamed because some dictator is off his rocker?  The reality is this argument is just as fallacious as saying that America caused 9/11 by training the Mujadeeen to fight the Soviets in the 80s.  These arguments take all responsibility from the person enacting the crime, almost like saying France create Hitler and therefore caused the death camps due to reparations.<br />The second assumption is that the oil for food program money ever went to food.  The reality is that the program created 2 billion dollars in commissions for U.N fat cats and that the rest of the money went to give Saddam more weapons.  Why doesn't Saddam get any blame for starving his people?  he is the one that led his nation on a disastrous war against most of his neighbors.  This book twists facts and history to create a plot that pitches itself to the 'I hate America' crowd while providing no evidence or truths in its telling the story of the Middle east.  In the end this book gives no credit to the actual leaders like the Ayatollah or King Hussein who play an important role in their region, rather it gives all the responsibility for every wrong doing to 'the west'.<br />Seth J.

The book purports to try to lift the veil off of Islamism and explain the Jihadists, their motives and origins.  The first chapter deals with Culture Talk, which is to say an open dialogue about Islam, the West and Jihad.  Here the book tries to show that `Jihad' as a term was first employed by Muslims who were fighting fellow Muslims, whether it was against the rich slave traders of Africa or the effendis of Saudi, we are told it was not a term aimed at non-muslims.<br />The second portion of the book tries to show how America grafted Jihad onto its goals in the cold war.  Typical of the `America is the greatest terrorist' this book tries to show that terrorism was invented by America to fight the cold war in Africa and central America.  Then the book tries to show that, having learned about terrorism while aiding the contras, the CIA created the Jihadist elements in Afghanistan.  In the final analysis the book argues that the CIA basically came up with the idea of Jihad and that by extension the CIA basically planned 9/11.  Here is where the book fails.<br />Apparently forgotten in these pages are several incidents of genocide against non-muslims by muslims that had nothing to do with the west.  No chapter sheds light on the Armenian massacres, the Assyrian genocide or the Hindu/Sikh genocide in Pakistan.  And of course no chapter explains the virtual genocide against the Chinese and East Timorese in Indonesia.  These incidents of mass slaughter had nothing to do with the cold war, just as the Moro Jihadist insurgency in the Philippines had nothing to do with the cold war.  It is true that their was massive funding for the Anti-Russian resistance in Afghanistan, and it is true that radical anti-western elements in the ISI of Pakistan encouraged the creation of Islamism.  But this doesn't fit the argument that this book is trying to convey, namely that the West is 100% responsible for 9/11 and Al Queida.  The reality is this book wants to blame the victim and to never blame those who are the actual terrorists.  Although the book quickly condemns terrorism by S. Africa it never once condemns the same exact terrorism when practiced against the west.  Why?  Is the argument here that when terrorism is employed by western countries then the west is `evil' and when terrorism is employed by Jihadists then it is also the west's fault.  Hypocrisy is the name of the game in the conclusion.  Thus there is a major failure of honesty in this read and many who hate America will be happy with this analysis but someone interested in the roots of Islamism will be left cold.  Two facts remain, first the CIA is given far too much credit for being competent, which it is not and Second there is a total ignoring of previous Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Muslim nationalists like Nasser.<br />Lastly the book tries to compare Christian 'fundamentalism' with Islamic 'fundamentalism'.  But the problem is their is not one incident where Christian terrorists have gone to an Islamic country and bombed mosques or schools while shouting 'God if Great'.  Their is simply nothing to compare, because witht he exception of Ireland their hasn't been any Christian terrorism in the 20th century.<br />Seth J. Frantzman11 and Al Queida.

Clark had written on the lead up to Iraq, O'Niell wrote about economics and now we have a book examining the far more insular world of ambassadors, CIA agents and special investigations in Africa.<br />The Ambassador has led a very action packed life.  Here we learn about the last American to meet with Saddam before war broke out in 1991.  We also learn about the growth of democracy in Africa and finally we learn about the famous `sixteen words' where Bush claimed he knew about Saddam looking for WMB in Africa.  SO Mr. Wilson was dispatched to Africa to hunt down the leads and in this eye-opening account we learn that all evidence that was found was embellished to such a degree that the truth no longer resembled the `findings' at CIA HQ.<br />This is an interesting account of what its like to be an Ambassador and gives  quick tour of various aspects of American foreign policy as well as certain special looks at Africa, where seldom does information make it to the general press.<br />In the end this book is not revolutionary, nor are the insights new.  The scandal of the `outing' of the Ambassadors wife is well known.  Although the accusations are back, the result is much ado about nothing.  The `outing' took place because the Administration wanted to explain how the Ambassador had gotten his job, namely on recommendation from his wife who had worked at the CIA on WMD.  Thus it was natural to send Wilson to Africa to track down what had happened in Nigeria.  The problem was that Wilson didn't produce, perhaps because of his partisan feelings, but more likely because their was no evidence.  So when questioned about he `sixteen words' we learn that the administration let Wilson's wife's name drop, partly out of revenge but partly out of disclosure to show why Wilson had been selected.

As a movement it came on the world stage as a socialist alternative to Communism.  Fascism saw the state as a nationalist vehicle for combating the excesses of communism, preserving the status quo while mobilizing the people to achieve `higher things'.  For 18 years Fascism in Italy thrived, although launching the state on two imperial wars, it left minorities well enough alone.  Fascism in Spain likewise didn't create the horrors of Nazi Germany.  Unfortunately, perhaps, Nazism is what Fascism has been associated with.  Yet fascist movements existed in other places to, throughout Latin America, and also in Lebanon and even among Jabotinsky's followers in Zion.<br />This book tries to give a rendition of Fascism as it was theorized all the way through to its bloody conclusion.  It focuses mostly on Italy and Germany, although writings of others are weaved together to show the Fascist mosaic.  In the end Fascism has far worse a connotation then communism even though Communism clearly exterminated millions more people then Fascism.  What was so abhorrent about Nazi Fascism was its obsession with racial purity,  nevertheless Communist regimes in places such as Cambodia employed similar racial ideas to prosecute their destruction of society.<br />The importance of this work cannot be underestimated.  Academia frequently gives students a `communist' interpretation of certain events, asking people to look at things through a `marxist' lens and to analyze events through the rubric of Marxist thought.  Thus many of us have a pretty good notion of what Communism is and was.  Yet most of us will hear the word fascism frequently without any guidepost as to exactly what the movement was or how it ever captured peoples imaginations.  Here is an excellent analysis of the birth, growth and death of fascism.<br />Any student of politics, political philosophy or European history will enjoy this lively intellectual account.  And, of course, the book certainly isn't sympathetic to Fascism, its merely an introduction.<br />Seth J. Frantzmancount.

Its taken for granted that most of the world press, especially in Europe is anti-American.  When it comes to the actual people abroad many support America, within certain limits. The problem is jealousy and this book lambastes them for this.  People simply have to walk down their streets and see Coca-Cola and McDonalds and they find themselves angry at the `Yankee'.  Probably the worst thing is that all the countries America has really put its neck on the line for hate America the most, whereas the countries that we actually bombed into submission like Japan and Germany are full of people who love us.  Irony?  Is it because we first saved the world from Fascism and then Communism?  Is it perhaps that hating America by foreigners is not just a sport, as claimed here, but is actually due to Americas own self hate.<br />This was the seminal problem with this otherwise uproarious account, it didn't probe the truth behind the hatred.  Beyond jealousy the single greatest reason that foreigners hate America is because we go abroad and we tell them how and why to hate America.  Fellow Americans like Chomsky and Soros spread anti-American venom throughout the world and then its ironic to go abroad and simply hear their ideas parroted.  But when foreigners say things like `Bush is the oil president' they are just parroting what they have read in the American press.  This book completely misses the boat on this essential truth.  Most foreigners wouldn't have as much to say against America if we Americans weren't so self-critical.  Nevertheless this is a wonderful and necessary account.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-05-18

Although the venerated author does tackle class, a very important  issue, the book doesn't seem to draw the obvious conclusion.  Here we see many of the familiar terms like \\"white money\\" or \\"white society\\" and yet this isn't America in 1950.  Today's America is no longer white, in fact society at large is far more Hispanic and Asian then it ever has been.  And yet there is still the racist stereotype that anything wealthy is white and that to succeed people must conform to `whiteness'.  Such is the lie and such is the sad state of affairs that even the many educated and successful people interviewed in this book seem incapable of getting past.<br />I was most unhappy not to se Condi Rice interviewed since I think her take on these things would have been most profound.  Nevertheless this was a good start, finally admitting that class sometimes trumps race.  The problem was that that conclusion didn't seem to draw this factuality out.  Poverty is endemic, its not racial, it's a sickness and a culture.  The culture of the trailer park mirrors the culture of the ghetto, and although racial lines may be drawn, they have little to do with success.  Success is also a culture and it turns out that wealth breeds wealth.  Thus the interviewees and this study should have drawn that idea out more, asking people to do what Booker T. asked them to do so long ago, namely, to succeed despite everything.  Dr. King asked us to judge people by the `content of their character rather then the color of their skin' but it seems that in some points made here skin color is still paramount.  And unless people heed Dr. Kings words, we will still be having `conversations beyond the color line' in 50 more years.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-05-18

Globalization exported to non-western countries enriches minorities, forcing the majority to commit acts of genocide and therefore creating chaos.  So basically the argument would be that if it weren't for globalization then the semi-fascist majorities would remain in power, dictatorships would be rampant, but at least their would be `order' and no `chaos'.  This book is basically one long trilogy blaming the hard working victim who happens to prosper because of liberalized markets.<br />In most of the countries examined, from Russia to Rwanda to Indonesia, their were minorities who took advantage of the equality granted them under new laws and liberalized markets to branch out of the jobs forced upon them by tradition and in some cases did disproportionately well.  According to this account the Chinese of Indonesia deserved to be attacked in race riots. Why?  Because they dared to become middle class, and not be servants.  And yet the book describes them as \\"suppressed indigenous majority.\\".  Which indigenous majority?  The Muslims who attacked Chinese owned businesses were new arrivals, since only a few hundred years ago their weren't Muslims in Indonesia, but their were Chinese.  So basically this book is just one giant excuse for genocide, blaming the west because our evil ideas of `equality of minorities' dared to allow the yoke to be taken off the heads of such disparate groups as the Jews of Russia or the Indians of Burma.  Apparently western ideas like `freedom of religion' created chaos and forced the majorities in countries like Lebanon to commit genocide, and here we have a whole litany of excuses as to why the majority Hutu had to go and slaughter their neighbors.  Basically the reasoning is simple:  how dare minorities ever break out of their ghettos and become independent, because if they do then they have to be crushed, and the excuse can be that they became western.  The reality is that the Tutsi of Rwanda never became western and neither did the Chinese, rather they simply became economically successful, and to the majority who were racist, that meant they had to trampled.<br />This book blames the west where it should be blaming the cultures that produced such ethnic and religious discrimination.  In the end this book leaves no real compromise, arguing that apparently the world would be better off if these cultures were allowed to just commit genocide, suppress religious and ethnic minorities and have rampant totalitarian dictatorships.<br />Seth J.

Frequently the Spartans, compared to their fellow Greeks in Athens, are shown to be chauvinistic enslavers of Helots to fund their semi-fascistic wars fought by engineered `supermen'.  But the problem with this frequent analysis and the comparison of Monarch ruled Sparta with `democratic' Athens is that they are simply wrong.  Forced Helotization was frequent in Greece and the `Democracy' of Athens did the same practice.  In fact the truth is Sparta was just as democratic and in Sparta the people were equals, with equal lands and equal rights, their wasn't even any coinage in Sparta.  In many ways the Spartan City State was the most successful country in Greece.  Sparta never suffered civil strife, and for more then 600 years the Spartan women did not see `the campfires of an enemy army'.  Unlike Athens or the other states Sparta wasn't continually suffering internal dissension or class conflicts, rather the community seems to have been relatively happy and at peace.  Some have argued that it was the `fascist' nature of the military utopia that kept rebellion from breaking out.  But history shows that most societies with strong central governments like the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany were not successful at suppressing their citizens over long periods of time.  Thus for things to go so well for 600 years the Spartans must have done something well.<br />By far the most unpretentious of the Greek states Sparta never built large buildings or temples, rather it was in its minimalism that it became wildly successful, and fanatically loyal to its own soldiers.  Only in Sparta was the life of one person valued, which is why the second peace in the Peloponnesian war came about because of Spartan concern over 150 hostages taken by the Athenians in battle.<br />This book is an interesting read.  The appendix has no real place in it but it can be ignored by simply not reading it.  The main drawback is that there is no detail as to exactly how the Spartans accomplished so much with so few people and so few soldiers.  It was a major accomplishment for Sparta to field an army even 1000 strong.  And yet for hundreds of years Sparta dominated all the states around it, holding almost a quarter million people in servitude in neighboring fertile areas.  In the end when Sparta was broken by Thebes no one seems to have wondered how such a tiny community had been so influential and so feared.  Never has the world seen a comparable state of such small population wielding such power with the exception, perhaps, of Israel or Singapore.<br />Seth J. Frantzmaning it.

In the end when Sparta was broken by Thebes no one seems to have wondered how such a tiny community had been so influential and so feared.  Never has the world seen a comparable state of such small population wielding such power with the exception, perhaps, of Israel or Singapore.  <br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-05-17

Planned to coincide with the Soviet liberation of Warsaw the Poles fought for 63 days until, their city reduced to rubble, they were forced to capitulate.  The Soviets purposely allowed the Nazis to crush the rebellion so that any vestiges of Polish independence would be destroyed.<br />This book opens the lid on this previously unstudied subject.  Meticulous research and analysis covers Polish-German relations from the 1600s through 1939.  Then the book follows up with separate sections on the actual rebellion and the post rebellion settlement.  Excellent character studies are made of leading officials such as General Boor.  The story is punctuated throughout with personal accounts by actual individuals involved, giving the book a very personal feel and contributing documentary evidence to the narrative.  This is a much needed account of an uprising that has frequently either been overlooked or confused with the earlier Warsaw Ghetto uprising.<br />Yet it is the books attempt to differentiate its narrative from the more famous Warsaw Ghetto Uprising which actually is its major drawback and flaw.  In 1939 Warsaw had been the second largest Jewish city in the world, and in many professions such as Academics Jews were the dominant force in Poland.  Yet this book attempts to downplay this in order to place attention on the other portion of Polish history under the Germans, namely the Catholic and nationalist Polish resistance movements.  This is why although the history meticulously covers the period 1939-1944, it barely mentions the Ghetto uprising, totally ignoring an event that would have been on the resistance's minds and an event that some members of the Polish resistance actually participated in, to rescue the remnants of the Ghetto fighters.  In refusing to cover this separate incident, even in a marginal manner, one wonders how much other information might simply have been left out because it didn't play to the tune of the Polish nationalist feel of the book.<br />So while this book fills an essential gap in history it is by no means a full history of the resistance of the Poles to the Nazi occupation. Nevertheless because of its meticulous research into the Allied relationship with the Russians and the Polish Home Army, one is given an extraordinary insight into the foundations of modern Poland.<br />Seth J.

Following on the footsteps of a new biography of Adams this book is a welcome contribution to early American literature on the founding fathers.  Born in the West Indies Hamilton moved to America and became a revolutionary war hero.  He was a federalist above all and admired Napoleons concentration of power.  He reorganized American finance as the first secretary of the treasury.  He sought rapprochement with England to increase commerce and he settled in New York.  Yet he was killed in an unceremonious duel with Aaron Burr, who was later to go on to become a traitor.  He has been seen as a controversial character mostly because many believed that had he been elected president he would have declared the dictatorship.  Little evidence exists to support this.<br />Hamilton was one of a second generation of American founders, along with Madison who dominated politics as Jefferson, Adams and Washington were eclipsed.  His untimely death dealt a blow to the federalists but it was not catastrophic and Hamilton and Monroe easily filled the gap. Hamilton is getting lots of press today and he has made a Trumanesque comeback in American history.  He is now considered to be one of the `great' founding fathers.  Its not clear if his actual accomplishments merit this weighting but certainly up until recently their was a dearth of scholarship on him, now there may be a plethora.  This will certainly remain the best researched standard on Hamilton for years to come.	2004-04-29

Nearly half the book has pictures in it and there is a wonderful inset of color photos.  The color photos show the unique international character of the allied armies, from Senegalese French troops to Vietnamese and Sikhs.  The rest of the text is a plodding, sometimes enjoyable read about the first world war and its important events.  From Jutland to Serbia to the Fall of Russia, the French mutinies and Gallipoli the war is covered.  There is not quite enough coverage of the Turkish-Russian theatre or of the Armenian genocide but this is to be expected. There is good coverage of the many weapons used, including the German rail guns, the 250mm long guns.  Scant coverage is given to German surface raiders or Von Spee but `Castles of Steel' is the superior choice for the naval war anyway.  In final summation this is a good read and the pictures are excellent.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-04-29

The main difference cited here is that America refuses to admit that it is an empire, unlike say the English and Romans who are proud of their empires, America enjoys self denial.  According to this enlightening text, we find that America may very be a benevolent if not at least a benign empire and we will indeed be a unique world power.

Along with `Clash of Civilizations' and Brzezinski's book this book is the singular best assessment of the new global position, especially as it relates to America.  The author divides the world into the non integrating `Gap' and the functioning `Core'.  Students of Political Science can be excused for surmising that this reminds them of the `center-periphery' debate.  But this book is not a scholarly approach, in fact if anything its greatest downside is that its language is playful and low brow, perfect for an introduction to the global situation but lacking for those who were enjoyed Huntington's earlier revolutionary work on the similar subject.<br />The analysis is wide ranging, part autobiography and part introduction to Naval War College analysis.  In the end the books greatest triumph is in the wonderful color map that details where exactly America has intervened between 1999-2003.  This map clearly illustrates which countries are seen by America as `allies' or at least `stable'.  This include S. Africa, North America, the southern cone, the EU, China, Japan, India and Australia.  Basically the middle east, eastern Europe, central Asia and most of Africa, along with central America are seen to be the potential problem countries.  By in large this simply reflects where America has had to intervene or where current wars and civil strife are taking place.  One could also argue that these are the countries with the most dictatorships and human rights abuses.  A very insightful text that is wonderful for anyone interested in Americas new vision of the world.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-04-29

In Europe their is no race, their is just people, but here in America people cant go five minutes without wondering about race and race relations, as if it is the single most defining item in life.  this book analyzes so-called 'biracial' kids and the trouble they have when posed the question 'where are you from' or 'what is your heritage'.  The answer should be as simple as 'Cleveland'  and 'Asian and white'.  But this book convolutes the subject by making it seem like 'biracial' kids have lots of trouble.  The reality is the only one giving them trouble is books like this that make them feel different and out of place and put emphasis on their 'racial differences'.  In reality 'biracial' is not even the correct word for children of two races.  Rather the correct word is 'American citizen' because these children aren't actually two races, if anything they are like most of us, they are a blend of cultures and heritage.  For instance lets say the kid is Mexican and black.  Then the kid is actually Spanish, Indian, African and maybe even part Anglo-Saxon, and probably has some moor blood as well.  So the kid is not really 'biracial' and the very term in itself is racist.<br />So in the final analysis this book does little to help children like myself, who are mutli-culture, and does more to harm then heal.<br />(...)	2004-04-26

The main argument here, above all the other rhetoric, is that adoption of interracial children should be the norm among people and that it is incorrect for the agencies to `match' the race of the children with the parents.  Rather the argument is the parents should just be given whatever comes along regardless of the fact that the parents might like to raise a kid that resembles themselves, thus making it easier for the child to feel that his parents are actually his parents.<br />The truth of the matter is people don't want interracial children.  Why?  Because people have a natural instinct to prefer what they are. Just as a dog would choose a puppy from its own breed a human will do the same.  Many couples have worked hard to adopt `unwanted' children, for instance both my uncles have inter-racial kids that are adopted.  And these people who are willing to have these children make up for all the people who prefer like-race children.<br />This book argues the opposite.  That its actually better for people to adopt outside their race.  But what is the motive here?  ISnt the motive secretly that the people adopting are narrow minded and believe that by adopting a child from another race that they are being `diverse'.  The reality is that a child does not make someone `tolerant' and it doesn't help the child to end up as a pawn in the race game that pervades America.  It is universally a fact that minorities refuse to adopt children that are inter-racial, in fact minorities frequently try to adopt children that are as `pure' which is to say one race as possible.  Thus this book is pitched to European-Americans asking them to adopt these `unwanted children' and arguing that those that refuse to do so are `racist'.  But what about the minorities, aren't they just as racist?  This book simply ignores this fact.  And ignores reality.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-04-26

Unfortunately this is just that, a beginning.  What about a relationship between a Mexican woman and an Asian man, or an Indian woman and a white man?  What about all the other races in America.  Today Latinos make up that largest minority group and yet there is no book documenting their inter-racial marriages.  This is because books like this perpetuate an obsession with black-white race, rather then expanding the study to include all races and all relationships.  It could have just been an overlook of the author to not include more diversity but it appears as if the book itself might be racist because it doesn't bother to look at the fact that inter-racial relationships are not `taboo' but rather are the norm between all the races in America, yet all the attention seems to be put on the black and white relationships.<br />Seth J.

Yet this argument simply ignores the facts.  First of all this book ignores personal responsibility.  How bout people on welfare taking responsibility for having unprotected sex and having ten kids without ever bothering to get married.  How bout taking responsibility for not having a job.  People that don't have jobs and can never find work are in that situation because they actually work to not find work.  Most people that are unemployed love being unemployed and they love living off the government dole and being lazy.  And this book simply ignores this fact.  This book tries to make everyone feel so bad for people that are basically in a situation they themselves caused.  Rather then trying to exhort these people to learn a new skill and not have as many kids instead this book blames the government because the government has dared to say `if you don't find a job in five years we might decrease your stipends'.  Amazingly enough in countries that don't have welfare people manage to find work.  If welfare ended tomorrow all these people would go get jobs,  in fact it is welfare that pays them not to work and discourages them from having a honest job.<br />(...)	2004-04-26

First off its predictable in its `exposing'  the `secret' life of Sororities and showing us that many of the pledging activities are less then wholesome.  The problem associated with Sorority pledging is not that hazing exists, because hazing in itself is useful(just look at the military)  the problem is that the hazing in sororities frequently involves making already insecure women more insecure and more immoral.  BY forcing women to do (...) contests and be involved in `naked parties' the Girls don't end up with  the same benefits that Male Greeks do, rather they end up learning that their bodies are all that will ever matter in life, kinda the opposite of feminism.  And beyond this the girls are basically taught that they are just pleasure tools for men and that what is required of them in life boils down to poll dancing or stripping.  But this image and these `insights' are mostly just the sensationalistic accounts most of us already were aware of.  The idea that girls `go wild' and run around nude to please each other and others isn't news.  This was simply predictable, and what wasn't highlighted in the text was that many sororities don't haze, thus negating these `oh my god' accounts.<br />The second predictable element was the feeling that many Greeks will simply hate this book while the public at large will pretend to now `understand' Greek life.  But this is a very slanted view of Greek life.  Greeks aren't all conformists because if they were then how would it be that Greeks go on to manage most companies and inhabit the Congress.  The reality is Greeks are simply like other clubs and this book totally ignores the fact that many university clubs haze.  In fact most of the honoraries at college haze just as bad if not worse then Greek Life.  And yet in the honorary system the girls wont be performing nude `cucumber jobs' for other girls, rather they perform them for men as well.  And for that edifying experience they get to join an honorary.  So really the only thing this book exposes is that people, when left to their own devices, are immoral and cruel, another not so big surprise.<br />So if you want to read an account of Sorority life that basically mirrors what you see on `girls gone wild' then this is the book for you.  If you wanted something deeper that examines the nature and history of Greeks this is not the place to find it.<br />Seth J. Frantzmany get to join an honorary.

This is a wonderful book shedding light on something no one ever admits, namely the obsession of white women with black men.  This does indeed expose the true taboo that no one ever mentions and that no one dares to speak of.  But what the problem is here is that this book doesn't discuss the other side of this erotic coin.  No where is it mentioned what all these white men were doing while their women were out with black men.  The truth is that all these white men where cavorting with the young black women who frequently served as nannies and cooks in these households in the 19th century.  In fact Strom Thurmonds own dalliance in the early 20th century with a teenage black women was simply the norm in those days.  Yet no book dares to expose the other side of a coin that many know about, the illicit `jungle fever' of Caucasian men for African America women.  So this book is a mixed bag, it examines one nature of inter-racial relations while ignoring another segment of 19th century society.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-04-26

But this book actually targets only one kind of marriage, namely that of white women and black men.  Unfortunately this book also takes up the rhetoric of trying to show how many `white lynch mobs'  were the norm.  In fact few documented instances exist of such a phenomenon.  In reality their were far more anti-white riots in the inner cities of the 60s then their ever were `white lynch mobs'.  But this boo gets away without using documentation because it is an accepted American myth that inter-racial dating is a terrible national taboo.<br /> Had this book bothered to analyze American history it would have noted that inter-racial marriages were the norm rather then the exception.  Interracial dating in fact created the modern Cherokeee nation, which is more Scottish then it is Indian due to the massive interrelations of these communities.  Also we see that interracial marriage between white men and Asian women were also the norm and that no `lynch mobs' rounded up these women.  Beyond these facts is the covert level of dating and marriage between white men and African  American women, of whom Mr. Strom Thurmond is simply the most famous.  In the end this book is the predictable text that is mildy racist towards whites in its polemics and inflated remarks regarding `lynch mobs' which in reality target more Jews in the South then they ever did African Americans.<br />Seth J.

This is investigative journalism, not history, and thus we are given a very intimate portrait of the president and his advisors and the halls of power from the U.N to Saudi to the white house where decisions were made and plans were hatched.  The main problem with this book is not its political views, because it is surprisingly balanced for such a heated subject.<br />The main problem here is that this book has no sense of history and no conclusion of context.  Just what was the Iraq war?  How will the Iraq war be judged?  For some the decision to judge the Iraq war a vast conspiracy is already cemented in our mindsets.  But for many the Iraq war has not crystallized.  For the Iraq war was quite simply a seminary event.  America has never before embarked on a war of building democracy beyond the western hemisphere.  One could argue differently about Japan and Germany but the reality is the American occupation of those countries was due to their own attacks on America.  In Iraq we have a country far removed from America posing no threat to the mainland, yet posing a threat to the region.  And we have an administration with the willingness to gamble that American troops could not just conquer a hostile Arab country but could also create democracy in a place where no such tradition exists.  In the least the administration felt a friendly dictator could be set up in one of the Middle east's most fractious countries.  This was the epic of the Iraq war.  Far beyond a mere conspiracy to get a few gallons of oil, and beyond the mere propaganda of WMD, Iraq was in affect the epic of America entering its place on the world stage as a hegemon, capable of anything.  Woodward doesn't touch on this theme and yet for a man of his stature and a book as anticipated as this it would have been nice to have a conclusion that explained just what the Iraq war symbolized for American policy.<br />Thus in the end this book is a balanced account of the events, without much analysis of the aftermath.

From the early American interventions in Haiti, Dominican republic, and the `Sandino Affair' in Nicaragua.  This book quickly moves to the Mexican civil war and then the Chaco war among others.  Urban terrorism such as the Tupamarus is covered in detail as well, just as the Allende coup is also covered although few died in the actual coup.<br />Then the attention turns to the revolutions in Bolivia,  the Shining Path of Peru, the `La Violencia' in Columbia and the Cuban revolution among others.  Even the experience of Latin American involvement in the world wars is covered as is the little covered `soccer war'  in central America.  Of the most recent large scale conflict, the Falklands war, is covered as well.  This is the only book that, in addition to its companion, covers the entire history of Latin American wars.  No other text exists that compares to this.  This book is not a military history though.  It doesn't specifically talk about small unit or even regimental tactics.  Rather large battles are mentioned.  Mostly this book looks at the causes, the differences, the combatants, the leaders and the social and economic challenges of the wars.

The premise behind this work is simple, no volume exists that documents every conflict in Latin America.  Although many books exist on the liberation struggle and a few books exist on the war of the pacific, no thorough scholararly account exists chronicling Latin Americas heretofore unnoticed violent history.<br />From the independence struggle to the early border wars and the breakup of the unified northern countries.  Little, or perhaps simply inadequate, coverage is given to the Indian wars, but this is mostly due to the fact that most of the Indians issues had been resolved by the 1810s.  The book covers every war from the Mexican American wars and interventions to the wars between Uruguay and Argentina and the war of the triple alliance which almost led to the extinction of Paraguay.  A wonderful text that quickly navigates the struggles.  This is not pure military history so although battles are covered this book does not lend itself to studying tactics and strategy, rather this book looks at the causes and affects and high points of the struggles.  If you are looking for a blow by blow account of which regiment went where and who turned whose flank, this is not the book.  But this is a thorough account and it documents even the smallest conflicts.  A must read for anyone interested in Latin America, many people think Latin America has always been peaceful since independence but the truth is the opposite.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-04-20

Did Christianity Begin with a Mythical Christ? : Challenging the Existence of an Historical Jesus	Books	2	25	174	N	N	Problems abound in the text	Jesus was a real person.  This book argues differently.  Here we see evidence presented that Jesus was a fictional character.  But the evidence is simply to large to the contrary.  The best evidence of Jesus is written by Josephus, a Jewish scholar who wrote in Latin and spoke of a man named Jesus, who created a `tribe' of Christians.  Josephus served in the Jewish war in AD 70 and he would have been in contact with people that actually knew Jesus.  Beyond this evidence is the biblical evidence.  The Book of Matthew clearly traces the lineage of Jesus back to King David.  Why trace the lineage of a person who was but a myth?  The tracing of ancestry was a typical Jewish trait to establish the reliability of Prophecy and therefore it is normal that such would have been done for someone real, not a made up character.  Beyond this evidence is the evidence from even the Qur'an which although it disagrees with the gospels nevertheless agrees that Jesus was a person.  Thus is it just no logical to argue that Jesus was a myth.  Certainly many of the acts of Jesus may be considered legend but the reality of a man named Jesus is an established fact.<br />Seth J.

Books	2	15	42	N	N	Pure Revisionism	This is a purely revisionist text with little basis in reality or fact.  Jesus was a normal name in the first century AD.  How do we know?  Because Josephus, a Jewish scholar who worked for the Romans and fought in the Jewish War of 70 AD.  Josephus reported that a man named Jesus had been a leader among the Jewish people and created a `tribe' o Christians, followers, who he reported `to this day exist'.  Thus we see that a very accurate history by a contemporary of Jesus wrote about Jesus as a real person, a real man.  The deeds and the acts of Jesus may very well be mythic but the reality of a living person named Jesus is just not up for debate.  This book tries to defame and revise the history of the Gospels by claiming that the `sect' of Christianity had some Pagan elements.  This may be true due to interactions of early Christians with Pagan tribes in Anatolia and Rome, but this doesn't cast the existence of Jesus in doubt, rather it casts the Christian theology into doubt.  So here we have a classic text that tries to pretend Christianity is a `myth'.  But the reality is he early gospels of Mathew have many very historical parts to them.  For instance Matthew details the lineage of Jesus back to King David, thus trying to make Jesus out to be a legitimate Jewish Messiah.  If Jesus was a pagan god then why would Matthew have wasted time tracing his genealogy?  This is one of many factual holes not addressed in this work.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-04-16

Aburish draws a parallel between American support for radical Islamic fundamentalists and minority leaders against the `masses' who would have selected someone else.  Several nations are picked out for criticism among them Lebanon's Maronites,  Syria's Alewite Asad, Saudis Wahabis, Iraq's Sunni Saddam and Jordan's King Hussien and even Arafat. While true that all these leaders were corrupt and probably didn't have the average Arab in his best interest it is a clich&eacute; to simply blame the west.<br />The reality is the House of Saud established itself, without western support, in the 1920s.  The Jordanian Hashemite King was installed by the British but the majority of Jordanians are Palestinians.  Is the argument that Jordan should become a Palestinian state?  Wouldn't this mean that the Palestinians would no longer be able to complain that they were `stateless' and `refugees'?  Although the Sunni's of Iraq are the minority it was Sunni wealth and traditions of governance that brought them, rather then the mountain Kurds or `Swamp' Shia Arabs to power.  The West actually supported King Faisal in Iraq only to see him overthrown by the Sunni Ba'athists.  In Lebanon it is true the West supported the Maronites but it is also true the west abandoned the Maronites during the Lebanese Civil War.  In Syria the west played almost no role in putting Asad, an Alewite, into power.  And the west certainly played no role in choosing Arafat as leader of the PLO.<br />So this book is a wonderful study.  The character assassinations and descriptions of fumbling, barbaric Arab leaders and strongmen is refreshing from the usual hum-drum academic works on these regimes.  The text is lively and fast paced, but unlike most Aburish books, the critiques have been heard before and most of them don't entirely stand up to scrutiny.  In the end the West did support Saddam and the Saudis, but this was only after most of these strongmen had already put themselves into power, rather then the west conspiring to suppress the Arab majorities. With the obvious exception of Jordan's King Hussien, who actually runs one of the more free and open Arab countries, so in reality the west has helped those Arab masses. Also not touched on is the fact that the Western support for Islamic fundamentalism against communism has recently backfired in the rise of Osama and anti-western fundamentalism.  Here the book shows that it is outdated.  And probably the book is also flawed in not acknowledging that the west cleared retreated and failed to install its leaders in Lebanon, despite intervention in the 50s and 80s.<br />Seth J.

Unfortunately this book is the one that is intolerant, intolerant of Christians.  Rather then giving Christianity credit for creating a homogenous Europe where people like Darwin, Newton and Marx and Locke could create their wonderful ideas of science this book accuses Christianity of suppressing everyone from Africans to women and maybe even pets.  But lest we forget that it is in the Christian countries of the world where women have the most rights, where minority rights are protected and where religious rights are protected.  Everywhere else in the world, in non-Christian countries, free speech is frequently illegal and religions are suppressed.  All one has to do is compare America, a Christian nation, to Saudi Arabia and one cans see the difference between Christian influence and other religions.  And it is undoubtedly true that pets are treated better in Christian Europe then in most parts of the world where pets are eaten for lunch or kept outside.<br />This books amounts to nothing more then religious hatred convincing its readers to hate Christians and the Christian faith.  Yet this text ignores the truth.  This book ignores that no Christian church anywhere preaches hate or intolerance or racism while many other faiths do actually preach such doctrines.  The book says that it was Christianity that destroyed art work.  While true of Christianity in the 1400s, it was actually Christian nations that created the renaissance in the 1500s, where the Pope himself employed artists like Michelangelo.  It was also in `evil' Christian Europe where Darwin and Newton began toe experiment with natures laws, and Pavlov raised his dogs and the mad monk cultivated his plants that led to the discovery of genes and heredity.  SO this book is simply one long diatribe of the worst side of Christianity, like the Spanish in Aztec lands, whereas it ignores the noble, good and peaceful deeds of the Christian faith.<br />Seth J.

For instance the book claims that there is no mention of Jesus in the Dead Sea Scrolls.  The Scrolls discovered at Qumran actually were written by the Essenes a Jewish sect that was mystical and midrashic in nature and wrote its texts in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD.  The reason Jesus was not mentioned is because the Essenes were Jewish scholars interested only in documenting the Torah, rather then writing diaries about contemporary events.  The first mention of Jesus in a non-Christian text can be found in Josephus's works on Jewish Antiquity which was written in AD 80, by Josephus who fought in the Jewish war of AD 70 and was born roughly around the time Jesus would have died.  Josephus wrote that Jesus was `a holy man,  believed to be a prophet'  and that `followers, the Christians exist to this day' meaning that early Christians were living around the time of AD 80.  This is a historical book documenting what was happening in Israel and Josephus saw no reason to elaborate on Jesus, but it is enlightening that Jesus, as a real person is mentioned by a non-Christian.  The legacy of the real Jesus is also found in the Qur'an which extensively documents Jesus life including his death.  Thus we find that not only Jews, but also Muslims agreed that a real person named Jesus existed and was seen by many as a prophet, one trying to reform Judaism.<br />This book claims that the idea of Jesus being a virgin birth was based on Pagan beliefs.  But this is also untrue.  The idea of a special birth was  Jewish idea first described in the Torah when Sarah gives birth to Isaac at the age of 80 even though she has been barren her whole life.  Also Sampson was born under special circumstances.  The idea of the `myth' of the virgin birth although contrived was based on Jewish theology which gave special status to special births.<br />The best evidence that Jesus was a real person comes from the gospel of Mathew when he described the genealogy of Jesus back to King David.  Why create an in depth lineage for a `pagan god'?  The truth is that Mathew was Jewish and Jewish tradition held that in order for someone to be a Messiah their roots had to be established.  Thus Mathew traced the true ancestry of a real man named Jesus.  In the end this book is just a series of false claims, innuendo and defamation aimed at Christianity and Christian theology.  Although parts of Christian theology like the trinity and the transfiguration seem odd, they are just as equally odd as the pagan tribes who used to drink blood, eat humans and sacrifice girls.  So in the end one can be assured that Christian theology is based on reality, with some legends grafted onto it.<br />Seth J.

Nasser served as the leader of Egypt from roughly 1952 tom 1970.  These 18 years were dominated by radical social change in Egypt, two wars with Israel, the loss of the Sinai and the conflict in Yemen.  Nasser embodied the `free officers' movement and pan Arab nationalism.  Nasser made inroads with Ba'athists of Syria and Damascus.<br />But most of all as this book sheds light on, Nasser was an Nasser's confrontation with Radical Political Islam, a phenomenon that the text argues has now come to dominate the Arab world.  Nasser opposed what we call `Wahhibism' or `Fundamental Islamism' and he fought against it openly in the Yemen while making sure to support secularists like Asad and rounding up the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt which was funded by the Saudis and had tried to assassinate him.  This impassioned book written by eminent Arab scholar Aburish, who previously wrote studies or Arafat, Saddam and the House of Saud, calls on people to have renewed interest in Arab Nationalism, which Nasser embodied.  This book sheds light ont he inner workings of arab politics.

Nevertheless Stalin, the man, has remained largely clouded in mystery, like something that haunts Russian history.  Here fort he first time Stalin is unmasked and his daily life is brought into the open. This intensely personal biography delves into the inner circle of Stalin's `court'.  From Mikoyan to Molotov, Khrushchev, Kagonovich to others like Beria and Zhdanov.  Here is the intensely intimate portrait of a nation, a people, and a group of leaders who rose to power in the late 20s and early 30s.  Stalin and his friends participated in a mass psychosis, one that came to grip the entire country as the Great Terror and the Purges accelerated.  As literally millions were shipped to the Gulags to work on such inane projects as the White Sea Canal, Stalin and his circle remained ever in control, but ever intriguing against one another.  This book covers every year and almost every great gathering in detail not hum drum \\"he went to lunch and then to bed\\" but in shocking irreverent portraits of how these characters circulated amongst one another and how they related to the country.  The most fascinating aspect of this is the intentions of the title `Red Tsar'.  Stalin believed that the Tsar had controlled the country with 300,000 minor nobility and Stalin intended to control the country with roughly 300,000 political officers.  In the end Stalin and his court mirrored the court of Ivan the Terrible or Catherine the Great.  Very little had changed.<br />Although Politics and Foreign affairs and the war is touched on it is not the main point of the biography.  The main point of this biography is to try to understand, nay to experience, the inner workings of the Politburo and the Kremlin under Comrade Stalin. Other biographies such as Volkoganovs have served as eye openers into `secret' portions of Stalin's life, while Conquests `Breaker of Nations' delved into Stalin's Gulags and foreign affairs.  But this is the first serious biography that allows the reader to understand the Russianess and the uniquely Russian traits that haunted the Soviet leaders.  Far from being revolutionary communists these men embodied the very spirit of Russia, from the standard suspicions to the shadow that history cast upon them.

During the 1970s the French, beginning their long relationship with the Iraqi Ba'athist regime, began shipping parts for a nuclear reactor to Baghdad.  The reactor at Osirak was almost completed in 1981 when PM Begin ordered a lighting raid to destroy it.  The heroic mission of Israeli pilots ranks with Entebbe in the history of daring raids against terrorist regimes.  Here is the story, finally, told in its fullest glory after more then 2 decades.  Here one will once again learn of how Israel, against all odds, dealt with the Iraqi menace 10 years before America was confronted with the same regime.  In fact Israel was taking the lead in destroying the same `Weapons of mass destruction' that future American administrations would complain about.<br />This is a wonderful blow by blow, minute by minute account from the diplomacy of the 1970s to the actual raid.  The text is quick and witty and the reader will enjoy the fast paced narrative of this much needed account of a forgotten military raid, that may have saved the world from a nuclear armed Iraq.

Full of clich&eacute;s such as `white mobs' and `lynchings' which were actually the exception and not the rule this book argues that because white men dared to say they were defending `white womanhood' that therefore they were enacting white patriarchy and suppressing blacks who they felt were `inferior'.  This argument goes on to further show that the `white patriarchy' tried to enforce a feeling of conflict between civilization and barbarism thereby enflaming racist passions.<br />The end conclusion here is that the trials pitted not just race but also class against each other and that the courtroom eventually gave blacks accused of crimes he right to confront their white accusers.  And in essence the question of interracial relationships is raised, turning the white female victims into heroines for daring to have inter-racial relationships during a time of segregation.<br />Yet problems persist in this simplistic and textbook account.  The question of white men raping black women is never addressed.  Why?  Because apparently that subject doesn't fit the traditional argument.  This book should have shed light on this all to common phenomenon, one at the heart of Strom Thurmonds own extra-familial relationships.  Thus the other side of the coin is never looked at.  And furthermore the text never addresses the fact that some of the women actually may have been raped.  The text takes it for granted that every single women was lying and that the `racist' white mobs simply assumed victim hood.  But perhaps the truth is that many of these women weren't lying and actually were victims of a crime, now glossed over to serve a traditional view of the pre 1960s south.<br />Seth J.

Although only 3000 slaves immigrated and Americo-Liberians make up only 2.5% of the population of the country today nevertheless the state has been seen as unique in its origins.  This book tries tot ell the tale of this `failed state' mostly by exploring the contemporary Doe/Taylor crises.  Samuel Doe was the man who assassinated Tolbert's cabinet in 1980 and took power, becoming the countries first indigenous African leader.  Charles Taylor was the Americo-Liberian who led a Libyan trained and Leone backed rebel offensive which took the capital in 1990.  Liberia had been known as a safe, democratic country worthy of foreign investment, not resembling its neighbors which had a long history of corruption and coups.  But today Liberia mirrors the rest of its neighbors and has descended into bloodshed.  This book tries to explore the complicated topic of `why?'.<br />There are several fundamental flaws in this dry read.  First and foremost is a total lack of maps or figures.  The early history of Liberia was one of its relations with the tribes that occupied the land, the Grebu, Kru and others.  This is a history that requires maps to explain.  Besides the dearth of maps, there is also no reliable figures showing population, economic or political statistic breakdowns.  These types of diagrams would have helped the reader understand the quickly glossed over history of this complicated nation. Nevertheless this remains one of the few studies of this interesting nation.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-04-12

Among these have been Scott Ritter and Hans Blix, both of whom claimed that Iraq was not a threat and that America acted too soon, in the first case Clinton's \\"Desert Fox\\" and in the second case the recent invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003.  The problem here is quite simple.  The inspectors didn't find weapons.  Does this mean they don't exist?  No.  The weapons did exist in the 80s and 90s.  in 1982 even the Israelis had to bomb Iraq's nuclear facility.  The Iraqi stockpiles and use of chemicals weapons in the 80s were widely documented.  So What happened to all this contraband?  Apparently it disappeared.<br />This account tells the story of the short lived and totally unsuccessful attempt by Hans Blix and his team in 2002-2003 to discover the banned Iraqi weapons.  One must remember Hussein had kicked out the inspectors after Desert Fox, and rightfully so.  The problem with the inspection, which this personal account doesn't explain, is that they were a charade and a failure from the start.  The Inspection were set up to fail.  In `Resurrection of Saddam Hussein' the details of the inspectors desert hide-and-seek game is plainly explained.  Here we have a case where the weapons they were looking for could be concealed in someone's basement.  So in the end this book leaves the reader with cold feet.  Clearly Blix feels that the inspections didn't find anything and probably never would have.  But this doesn't really preclude the existence of weapons it simply means they were readily visible.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-04-12

In 1801 Jefferson dispatched the newly created U.S Navy to deal with the state-sponsored piracy of the Barbary states, Tunis, Algiers and Morocco.  This book paints Jefferson as a President willing to extent American values and principles overseas by fighting America's `first war on terror'.  Although this language is slightly clich&eacute;d and not entirely accurate in the 19th century sense, nevertheless the book gives a resounding argument behind why terror and unlawfulness must be punished and that appeasement never works in the face of unfettered aggression.<br />Probably the most interesting aspect of this war was that the fledgling America was willing to go all the way across an ocean under the vary eyes of the Europeans America had rebelled against, to fight a nameless enemy only to protect American merchant interests.  In many ways this was a forward thinking war.  Smacking of Palmerstons later `gunboat diplomacy' this war against the Tripoli showed how a newly formed idealistic republic was willing to go around the globe to protect is citizens from barbarism.  A wonderful read, the authors style is quick and witty, and the writing is lucid and action packed.  Any student of American history will enjoy this new take on Jefferson and the young American navy just as anyone interested in today's war on terror will enjoy its 19th century antecedents.<br />Seth J.

Here for the first time is an account of the Vietnam war fought by the Nixon administration. Nixon began his experience with Vietnam with more then 500,000 men in Vietnam, and he inherited the massive protests from the LBJ administration.  Nixon's first reaction, since the Army had crushed the Vietnamese in the aftermath of Tet, was to break the will of the enemy.  Nixon's instincts led him into the Christmas bombing in 72, the bombing of Hanoi, the intervention in Cambodia and the mining of Haiphong harbor.  All these acts came just short of crippling N. Vietnam.  And then, just as the war was about to be won Kissinger signed the Paris accords.  Why?  Because Nixon had promised `peace with honor'.  Nixon had ended the draft, re-instituted the volunteer army and eventually brought all the Americans back home.  But in the end he ensured the end of the freedom of S. Vietnam.  This book tries to blacken the Nixon legacy further by showing that he needlessly prolonged the war and that he caused undue destruction of the North.<br />Yet the book has several gaps.  First and foremost it is a political, not a military account, which is unfortunate for anyone interested in the facts on the ground and the truth behind the `Vietnamization' of the war.  So we don't learn much about the competence or abilities of newly trained S. Vietnamese units nor do we learn about the successes of programs like Phoenix.  Also missing is the truth behind the fact that the protestors were actually looked to by the North as inspiration to keep fighting.  In the end this is a necessary addition to the scholarship on the Nixon period 1968-72, but lacks many points.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-04-07

Bush	Books	2	58	405	N	N	Mostly false claims	This book claims that the Bush white house is more corrupt then the Nixon administration and it claims to know the truth since its by an insider from the Nixon years.  One problem though.  The Bush administration hasn't done anything corrupt.  The Bush administration hasn't hired crooks to break into hotels, the way the Nixon administration did.  The Bush administration hasn't planted documents, firebombed think tanks, released psychological records the way the Nixon administration did to its enemies.  And unlike the Clinton administration the Bush administration hasn't used the IRS to probe peoples private lives.  And last of all, None of the Bush administration cabinet members or staff will ever go to prison for deeds done while in power, unlike Halderman, Ehrlichman and John Dean, all of which were convicted of various crimes under Nixon and many of whom served prison terms.<br />This book is simply false.  IT is mostly a wild claim aimed at getting you to open the cover, when the allegations and innuendo are not proved and few facts are given and the arguments, weak at best, are never fleshed out.  Unlike the Nixon years when the crimes were clear, it just wasn't clear who ordered them.  Bush and his men have done nothing of the sort and neither are they accused of any crimes that parallel the Nixon, Clinton or Kennedy years.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-04-07

Decidedly American in nature, although the author argues it was inspired by the French revolution, the Haitian revolt against both Spain and against England and Spain helped create the second independent republic in the Americas.  Toussaint, the leader, became a folk hero and the consequences reverberated all across the Americas, as images of slaves putting their masters to death were scene in the daily papers.  Of course the most important political implications is that the Haitian rebellion ended Napoleonic hopes for an expanding empire in the Americas.<br />This is an important analysis and account of the Haitian rebellion, interesting in light of the recent problems in Haiti, which has unfortunately become the poorest country in the Americas, in direct opposition to its American neighbor who gained independence a mere dozen years prior.<br />Seth J.

But instead this book is polluted with the false idea that no matter that Americas roles was over the last 60 years it was always `wrong' and usually full of `racist' `stereotypes'.  The false logic here goes so far as to say that America didn't understand middle eastern `culture' and therefore basically no matter what America did, whether it supported secularism as in the Shah or support militant Islam as in the Muhadeen in Afghanistan, America must be somehow `bad'.<br />This is the false foolish logic that permeates this political tripe of a text.  Here we find the argument that somehow because America supported Israel's `right to exist' since 1960 that America deserves to be hated in the Middle east.  OF course this ignores the fact that America under Eisenhower supported Nasser and Egypt.  And it ignores the fact that America helped create and prop up half the regimes that exist in the middle east, from Saudi to Pakistan.  There is very little to be gleaned here unless you are one of these people that believes with the analysis that America is evil, and racist and never does anything good or proper.  In the end this book neither admits nor understands the very American policies it was supposed to tell the history of, thus making one wish they had an actual history book in front of them, rather then a political broad sheet.<br />Seth J.

But more then that it is a history of American political life from the 1960s to present and the development of the policies of various administrations.  This is the wide ranging history of think tanks and policy wonks, of lobbying groups and obscure professors, of old ideas and new revolutionary concepts, and of a small breed of like minded individuals sometimes in power, sometimes out, who came to the pinnacle of their abilities under George W. Bush.  These men and women of diverse backgrounds and from diverse places in the political landscape combined academic ideas and military sills along with policy know how to craft a revolutionary new American doctrine.  This book also presents biographical sketches that provide a refreshing insight into people like the oft-maligned Cheney, who this book shows  came from a solid middle class background, whereas many assume we was born into wealth.<br />This is a wonderful read that takes the reader on a fast paced accessible tour of Washington politics.  It would be helpful to go into this read with at least a perfunctory knowledge of who people like Jean Kirkpatrick, Henry Kissinger and Richard Pearl are.  It would also be helpful to have at least a quintessential understanding of the various larger foreign policy issues of the Nixon, Carter and Reagan administrations, all of which were formative for the `vulcans'.  Nevertheless this book serves as both a primer and a textbook on these amazing characters, both a biography and a political book, this is a must read and a book you will not find easy to put down.<br />Seth J.

In this book it is assumed that since Rome dared to make value judgments and condemn the barbarians, who in fact were savage and ruthless, that Rome must somehow be some sort of evil hegemon like America and the Barbarians must have been `noble savages' like innocent peace loving native Americans.  Unfortunately this is revisionist tripe.  The reality is the barbarians actually were savage and it took Roman civilization to pacify and civilize them.  Only by serving in the legion and learning roman ways of life and settling in the provinces did the barbarian tribes like the Gauls adopt civilization and become what we know today as the medieval europeans.  If it hadn't been for Rome and Rome's extraordinary pursuit of science and technology and administration Europe would be a cultural backwater of feuding tribes to this day, much the way Creaser found it in 30 AD.  In fact Rome's influence is so broad that not a major town exists in Europe today that doesn't include the trappings of a Roman wall, aqueduct and amphitheater.  The Barbarians on the other hand built few lasting structures.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-04-05

Yet this book sheds new light on the Mongol influence throughout the world.  From the dynasties of china to the Moguls of India to the many potentates throughout central Asia and even in Russia Mongol influence didn't simply disappear but survived even to the modern day.<br />The secret to this 'hidden' impact on world history is the quick assimilation of the Mongols.  They quickly adopted the faith of those they conquered, in most cases Islam, and through this new medium they spread themselves out, founding dynasties and small empires throughout the world.  Mongol 'hoards' existed in Russia for hundreds of years having an impact felt even in Europe.

The working poor aren't `invisible' in fact they are very visible.  Every time one gets gas or goes to a fast food restaurant or goes to a lumber yard they get to witness the working poor in their natural environment.  And in fact the term `working' is improperly addendumed to the word `poor' in this book. Many poor people, this book ignores them, are not working at all, they are simply sitting around.

He was a communist and a soviet spy.  Although he very well may have morphed and changed, he did in fact serve the Russian government for a time, and these records have clearly come to light following the opening of KGB archives in the 1990s.<br />This book is a look at the Hiss case, the ultimate `trial of the century' which pitted the anti-communist crusaders like Nixon, Chambers and Mcarthy, against the eastern establishment's pretty boy Alger Hiss and his leftist allies.  The case, its details are all in dispute and so are all the semi-important `facts' regarding the defense and prosecution.  This book tries to peel away the layers of propaganda that have pervaded the Hiss case over the years and instead shed light and the actual details of what happened.

For many years, due to lack of access to East German archives the results and history of the Dresden bombing were not only clouded in mystery but were actively falsified by nazi sympathizers to make people `feel sorry' for what took place.<br /><br />This book paints a new picture.

The story follows the young girl as she is forced to wear a viel and `modest' full body black robes  and then as se is barred from being educated with the boys and she witnesses the suppression of women as her mother, who had a good job and a college education, is forced to wear the same `modest' clothing and forced to stay home.<br />But this is a story of strength and perseverance against a tyrannical government.

The central claim here is that Mr. Bush misled the nation into invading Iraq and that from the beginning the number one target was Iraq.  There are two major flaws with this line of reasoning.  First and foremost is the fact that the author was himself in charge of the war on terror.  The mistakes attributed to the President are in reality Mr. Clarks mistakes.  The fact that America wasn't prepared or that Osama wasn't caught were Mr. Clarks mistakes and this book in many ways is his argument defending himself and passing on blame to the president.<br />The second major flaw here is that this book entirely overlooks the invasion of Afghanistan.  In trying to claim that Iraq was superimposed as `target number one' the book pretends that the invasion of Afghanistan never happened.  But the reality is that America struck first at Afghanistan, and when Osama wasn't found America moved onto Iraq, to deal with another unsavory dictator.  Mr. Clark had argued for `containment' of terrorism, a theory that smacks of Kennans approach to Moscow, so the actual victories in Afghanistan where 200s of terrorists were arrested and thousands killed were not the design of Clark.  Once again this book proves to be mostly overblown `insider' comments and much pass the buck.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-03-22

This is true to some extent.  What the book ignores totally is that this is not a new phenomenon, rather the immigration of people has been a fact of history.  In the 1860s similar arguments were made that immigrants, Irish and Italians at the time, were going to overrun and destroy America.  Odd how now the descendants of those Irishmen and Italians write books like this and say `how dare immigrants come to America.'  Irony?  Obviously this text is alarmist in nature and the points made are not correct when one notes the long history of immigrations.  Event he current `Caucasian' populations of Europe are immigrants, from Central Asia.  This book ignores these facts.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-03-18

But the content in developing this thesis makes this book a pure hate book.  The argument goes on to try to `prove' that the `white' race is superior because European civilization is superior and tries to show `scientifically' how other races are dumber.  But then the text takes an even more bizarre turn into anti-Semitism, claiming that the Jews who the book claims have higher IQs are controlling the world.  Typical anti-Semitic tripe.  But the argument is illogical.  If the book believes that intelligence is the determining factor in greatness, then how can Jews be then discarded as `inferior'.  The book, of course, ignores history by claiming that Europeans are superior.  What about Europe in 800 B.C when the Gauls were eating their own children and Rome and Greece were barbarian republics?  IN 800 B.C civilization was in Africa and China and the Middle East.  Obviously this puts the arguments on their heads.  Truly a sad hateful work, although it had potential in its claims that civilization and race do have certain commonalities.  Obviously race isn't merely `constructed' as other argue, but Race has little to nothing to do with the success of civilizations in the long term.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-03-18

This claim alone should relegate this book to obvious inaccuracy.  Anyone with even one eye can determine exactly what race someone is by looking at them, the exception being people of mixed heritage.  But modern anthropology taught at every college in America teaches the physical differences of indigenous people of Africa, Asia and Europe.  But beyond this false argument the book then descends into the swampish argument that Eugenics have been used in America for `sexist' and `homophobic' purposes.  How is this possible?  Are their more men in America then women?  No.  So how were Eugenic used for sexist reasons.  This argument is never backed up, it is just said with the idea that the audience will gobble up this as `truth'.  And how can genetics have been used to `homophobic' reasons when even the most left wing homosexual activists admit no `gay gene' exists.  This argument is simply pure fallacy and this book makes many outlandish claims that seem to be in line with the statement `if you tell a big enough lie enough times people will believe it'.  Not a reliable text.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-03-18

Unfortunately this is patently untrue.  The Japanese themselves were the ones obsessed with Race as they invaded half of Asia to create a `co-prosperity sphere'.  Of course the only people meant to prosper were the Japanese.  Far from `turning racism on its head' the Japanese were far more imperious to the people they conquered then the U.S and English had ever been.  In fact millions of Koreans, Indians, Thais, and Philippines were enslaved, raped and murdered during the war, not by the Americans(who they viewed as liberators) but by the Japanese occupation forces.  In China, especially at Nanking, the Japanese entered into a war of extermination against the Chinese.  Why?  Well the patently racial doctrines convinced the soldiers that the enemy was `inferior' and this key point is missed in the text.<br />This books argument must be taken to task for it ignores the facts.  The reading here doesn't fully explain the true affects that `racism' had on the Japanese mind set prior to the war.  The Japanese didn't set out to `payback' the Europeans, rather they took the racial doctrines to heart and simply adopted them.  In the end it was the Japanese offensive that used race as a motivator rather then the U.S and England.  How else can one explain why all the nations of Asia viewed the Americans as liberators?<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-03-17

This is a needed contribution to the scholarship.  Li Lisan was co-founder of the Communist party and went on to study in France and then settle in Russia.  Although this book focuses on his love affair with Elizabeth Kushkin, it also tells a weaving fascinating story of the links between international communism and cracks within it.  Excellent portraits are given of the mercurial Stalin, who jailed Lisan along with many international communists who didn't toe the party line.  In the end Lisan returned to China, saw the civil war to communist victory and then was finally killed in 1967 in the cultural revolution, just prior to the large scale military skirmishes on the China-Russia border that showed the final split between Moscow and Beijing.<br />A wonderful book.  A must read for any Chinese or communist enthusiast.  This book brings back to life the heady days of warlords, Sun Yet Sun and the birth of communism in China during the chaos of the early 20th century.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-03-17

America.  This book gives special attention to the many 'acts' of these right wing groups, usually resulting in assasinations of left wing leaders throughout S. America and elsewhere.  Much attention is given, of course, the role the CIA and AMerica played in first encouraging the Pinochet coup and then aiding 'pinochetism' throughout Latin America.<br />The main problem and flaw of this immensely readable text is that their is no context for the Pinochet action.  In the 1970s the left wing groups were'nt simply lovable democratic insitutions, they were also revolutionary terrorist organizations like the FARC of Columbia, the Shining Path of Peru and the Tupamarus in Uruguay.  The Tupamarus in particular were a terrorist organization bent on destroying a peaceful democracy.  In the end it took right wing militarism and the support from people like Pinochet to push back the leftist terrorists.  This book paints a picture of 'evil' right wing 'death squads' maurading around the world killing off peaceful leftists.  Very little context or history is given to show the intentions or 'acts' of the left wing groups targeted.  In fact the destruction of the Tupamaurs saved Uruguay from becoming a totalitarian state ala Stalin's Russia.  The reality was that the left wing terror groups were every bit as terrible as Pinochet's 'condor' squads.  So although this text is well written it is only half the story, but a neccesary introduction.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-03-17

Nevertheless any study of Soros's multi-billion dollar Hedge fund style investments will show that he has not only funded democracy but he has invested heavily in these countries to earn a profit.  Keeping democracy alive mostly is in self interest to the Soros pocket book, rather then any benevolent idea of helping the 'people' of Eastern Europe, who mostly remain poor and starving, subjected to terror and mafia style corruption that did not exist under totalitarian Communism.  In the end the people of Eastern Europe traded the false-god of Communism for the equally false-god of investment banking and cowboy capitalism, with Soros at the forefront.<br />A dangerous text full of self obsession and slight of hand regarding Soros's personal investments in these societies, smacking of conflict of interest.<br />Seth J.

Born in poverty in one of the worst ghettos of Jamaica he found Music to be his passion, and through it he weaved Politics, history and love into a common mosaic.  Marley's new style, his conversion to Rastafarianism, much to the surprise of Haile Sallaise when he visited Jamaica and was almost crushed by crowds, and his exporting of his music and values to America and Africa is an extraordinary story.  From Marley's impassioned plea for feuding politicians Manley and Seaga to `come together' as well as Marleys succesful tours of the States and his appearance at independence celebrations in Africa. This is the standard text on Marley and it covers everything from the intricate details of his musical breakthroughs, to the history of his religion and even the current affairs of Jamaica.<br />You will not be disappointed with this excellent, fast paced read which brings the story to a close with Marleys cancerous toe, discovered while playing Soccer in Central Park.<br />Seth J.

This is a good book but it has several small flaws.  First of all the title is slightyl misleeding.  This book is more then just the hunt for 'the bearded menace' Saddam.  This book is really a chonicle of intelligence gathering prior to the war and then the subsequent hunt to catch Saddams circle.  This circle included Saddams sons and in fact the greatest acheivemetn of the American forces was killing his barborous children.  THe reality is that Saddam was not found as much by american expertise but rather by local lip wagging.  So this books title is slightly misleeding but the story is a must read.  Mostly this book explains that the Iraq war was in many ways a personal war, waged against one man and his inner circle, unlike most wars in the past which have been waged against entire nations.  One item not explained in this text is why Saddam Hussein was found which a giant canned ham just ten feet away.  In a country like post-war Iraq it must have ben hard to find canned ham.  So where did Saddam find such an item?  A true perplexing mystery, but nevertheless this is a wonderful quick, action-packed read.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-03-15

It reads like a novel, from character to character from country to country surveying Europe from 1945 to present and the lives of the Jews who remained after the Nazi horror.  Looking deeply into the lives of Jewish communities in the eastern block the author illuminates the still struggling Polish community, who suffered anti-Semitism either because they were communists or because they were not, usually simply as an excuse.  The author deals with specific individuals and this is probably the greatest flaw of the text.  Jews came to the very pinnacles of government in Poland and Czechslovakia(Slansky) and yet these pivotal government officials are all but ignored, because the author concentrates on the everyday lives of Jews who chose to either immigrate to or remain in Europe.  So one is found wishing they could read more about Bruno Kriesky the Jew who led Austria in the 70s and was noted for being anti-Israel.<br />The book is broken up into neat sections detailing the growth out of the rubble of the holocaust, 1968 and the rebirth of European anti-Semitism among other subjects.  Good portions are devoted to large Jewish communities in France and Italy.  One overlooked community are the Spanish Jews who supported Franco, but otherwise this book is a must read for anyone interested in modern Judaism or post WWII Europe.<br />Seth J.

From short histories of whaling to the birth of the Jesuit missionaries and other things this read is like a scroll of history.  From detailing the odd and confounded Carlist wars to the Basque support of Republicanism, although they had nothing in common with the radical communists, and of course the modern issue of the ETA and the suppression of the Basques under Franco, this book seems to do it all.  Immensely informative while not always willing to make judgment calls this book is still a must read.  On par with other wonderful works like 1968 and `The Chosen Few' this book also has great chapters on Basque food and the Basque language.  Anyone will enjoy this book.

Perusing many different subjects without much connection and hopping from island to island(one has to in the Caribbean) this book details many of the issues the Caribbean faces.  From large remnants of the salve trade to smaller remnants of the indigenous people(Arawak and Carib) as well as the everlasting sting of colonization this book paints a colorful picture of the many personalities of the islands and their diverse history.  Probably the most ignored fact of the book is that while the British dominated islands have become largely successful democracies the former French and Spanish colonies have slumped into depravity.  Little analysis is done and the figures presented mostly are not analyzed.  Nevertheless this book is more travel journal then history, and popular history at best, so it does its trick.

Smith's book argues clearly that although his was a government of the minority it was a benevolent government, and one which when history judges, was better then what has been today in Zimbabwe.  This book tells this epic tale from a hands on point of view.<br />History has proven this book to be accurate and its assessments to be wholehearted.  Mugabe, who was supposed to represent `majority rule' has proven to be a thuggish dictator, he has driven his nations economy into the ground so that whereas under Smith the country exported grain, it now relies solely on foreign aid.  Mugabe has jailed the journalists and outlawed political dissent.  And to boot Mugabe has thrown all the minorities off their land.

First off this is the perfect book for any return Jew, secular Jew or anyone interested in the many facets of Judaism.  For instance:  How did Reform Judaism start?  What was the Sanhedrin?  Who was the Baal Shem Tov?  Probably many Jews would stumble over the answers or be left speechless and this is where this book shines.  This book details almost every facet of Judaism anyone could ever want or need to know.  What is the difference between the Mishnah and Midrash?  Once again this book gives short concise answers to this.  From Ertez Israel to the Oral law this book outshines many like it in the sheer breadth of knowledge contained.<br />The major flaw in this book is that it is almost useless if you are already versed in Judaism.  If one wants something deeper and wants a more thorough explanation of the items contained here they will not get it.  This book is written in a folksy manner, like someone lecturing a small group of interested students.  Jokes protrude from the page for instance \\"many Europeans believed Jews had to kill every tenth patient...I wouldn't want to be the 10th guy in line at the doctor\\".  While funny these passages detract from the text and sometimes makes the book feel more like `1000 things you didn't know about Judaism'.

This book tackles a fascinating subject; scurvy which killed 100,000s of sailors.  Many passages illuminate the causes and affects of this terrible disease, which quite simply results from a lack of vitamin C and causes the bond of the body to weaken, causing terrible bleeding in the gums and from the skin.  The cure for scurvy was not understood for 100s of years and this book takes the reader on a quick stroll through this history.  Why did Eskimoes, who ate no vegetables, not suffer scurvy?  This question was posed by the English whose aptitude for eating limes gave them the nickname `limies' since limes appeared to counteract scurvy.  Why did preserved meat not work?  Why did cooked meat or limes not work?  These questions were eventually answered by the man who found out the truth behind the disease.  This is the books central theme and actually its main detraction.  Since the book focuses on the men, reminiscent of the recent book on the OED, it detracts slightly from the overall history of scurvy.

Concentrating mostly on the period of the 1860s-1920s this is the most amazing, excellent historical account of Mexico in the period that can be found.  Far more then a tail of American investment this book tells the story of Mexico and its people experiencing the pangs of development and industrial revolution.  President Diaz who dominated Mexican politics during this period made it possible for a vast number of Americans and other foreigners(like Germans and Spaniards) to purchase vast tracts of lands and develop not only the Oil industry but also the Mexican rail industry.  In the 1910s a series of revolutions beginning with the Huerta insurrection brought such luminaries to the fore as Villa and Zapata.  These forces eventually destroyed the large American investment in Mexico, harming the American exile community(much of which had helped to build up Mexican infrastructure) and swept away and entire era of Mexican politics.  The Veracruz intervention is documented in great detail as are all aspects of the `Americanization' of states like Sonora.  Scant attention is paid to the role of American tourists or Mormon missionaries or the years of 1930-1990(the era of the PRI).  But nevertheless the book does bring the history to the present of NAFTA and presumes the election of FOX and the `almost' election of the PRD in the early 90s.<br />A wonderful book.  A great read and one of the only books to give such a sweeping colorful detail to this essential period of Mexican history.  A period that harpers to today's Mexican law which forbids foreigners from owning land in Mexico.

Apparently the 7 million Jews and million other germans, communists, Gypsies, Catholics and other minorities just immigrated to somewhere, somewhere no one has been able to find them but I guess they didn't leave their forwarding addresses.  This book is a hoax and its text is full of hate and racial slurs, terrible misfactuals and contemptable academics.  Buyer beware.	2004-02-27

Which peaceful settlement would that hve been?  The peaceful settlement when the COnfederates fired on Ft. Sumner or was it the peaceful settlement that would have allowed Slavery to exist?  Was it the peaceful settlement that would allow states to suceed from the union any time they wanted?  This books argument is wrong and the idea is nonsense.  Any true student of the Civil war knows that the war, once Lincoln was elected, was inevitable.  Regardless if you support the South or think the war was a catastrophe(it was) it doesn't mean you can just re-write history and decide it didn't need to happen.

One problem with this argument is that many Jews actually do resemble their arab and Simitic cousins in the middle east.  Many Palistinians have fair, blond, features, but that doesn't mean they are not Arabs, it just means they intermingled with europeans crusaders.  The reality is that the Khazars NEVER immigrated to Khazaria, they were whiped out by the mongols.  Most of the tribes of the Caucuses were not emigratory tribes, like the armenians and Georgians and Chechens, they were sedintary and like the Khazars they weathered the storm of invasion.  Unfortunatly the Khazars did not weather the storm very well and they disappeared, but they NEVER moved to europe and this book is full of hateful remarks and polemics against the Judiasm, very offensive.	2004-02-25

Two major problems abound.  First, most Jews do actually share many Semitic(middle eastern) qualities in their features.  Now the Khazars were Caucasian, which is to say they were very different looking then say Arabs, who are also Semitic.  The Khazars disappeared in the wake of the Mongol invasions and few if any were ever able to travel to europe and mingle with their fellow Jews.  The Khazars were a unique people but like most peoples of the Caucases they did not immigrate to anywhere, they simple stayed in their place, like the Chechens and Armenians and Georgians have also done despite invasion and persecution.  So the hateful polemic that is said in this book, used to defame Judaism, is not credible and those interested in Khazaria should search for the actual Thirteenth Tribe book that was written by the author, not this text which is published by a Neo-Nazi organization.	2004-02-25

Scurvy is said to have caused more misery then all diseases and to have killed 100,000s of people at sea.  This book was the first true study of the disease and the history of mans seek to cure it.  During the age of sail every voyage was plagued with preventing scurvy.  Most prone to scurvy were the exploration expeditions that the Europeans launched all over the world from the 1400s to the late 1800s.  For 400 years, as this book supremely documents, Scurvy was THE problem with seafaring, because if the crew died it really didn't matter if you found land or not.  Thus many remedies were tested and tried, some that did NOTHING and others that hit the nail on the head without realizing it. For instance it was observed that the Eskimoes, who subsisted on an all meat diet, did not have scurvy.  The European sailors who were experimenting by bringing using fresh vegetables to combat the Scurvy, were suddenly dumfounded, not realizing that Vitamin C existed potently in raw meat as it did in Limes.  This wonderful book weaves many amazing tales of hardship, survival, experimentation and the like.  An important work and a good read.	2004-02-25

This premise is wrong, pure and simple and the book does not rpove its won thesis.  The book uses examples of American wartime propaganda to show how `racist' the Americans were.  But what about the Japanese?  The Japanese committed genocide in Nanking China, they forced millions of Koreans into slavery, including massive sexual slavery.  The Japanese tortured and cut the heads off and performed Nazi-like experiments on the POWS in their custody.  The Japanese committed atrocities against every people they controlled from the Phillipinos to the Vietnamese.  But these racist doctrines are ignored in this book because the book is totally one sided in its `hate America' claim that everything America did in the Pacific was wrong.  Apparently the 15 nations that America helped liberate didn't feel the same racism that this book claims existed because from Haiphong harbor in the west to Manila the peoples of Asia celebrated the coming of the Americans and English and other free peoples who pushed the Japanese back to the Island they had launched the war from 20 years earlier.  History and facts show this book to be pure anti-American polemics rather then the `groundbreaking' ideas that it claims to represent.  The only ground that is broken is the ground of truth and honesty.	2004-02-25

Beginning with a short introduction of the `early years' the book quickly opens with Wingate in 1936 Palestine/Zion where is quickly discovers the passion that he will keep for the rest of his life, namely Zionism.  Wingate, witnessing the anti-Semitic nature of the British officer corps, gravitates towards the Zionists due to his penchant for sticking out and backing underdog causes.  This book tells the riveting story of Wingate's training and arming of the famous `night squads' which became the backbone of the Palmach who eventually led Israel to victory in the 1948 war.<br />The second story is the story of Wingate in Africa.  Exiled to Africa because of his deep connections to the Zionists Wingate once again latches onto a new cause, the 1941 liberation of Ethiopia, which had been the last free African state before the Italians invaded it.<br />The third story is where Wingate once again shined, namely in Burma leading the Chindits who operated behind enemy lines fighting the Japanese.  Once again Wingate's penchant for native causes and brilliant ability to adapt unorthodox fighting techniques helped prepare the way for British victory.  Churchill called Wingate a genius and when you read this book you will wholeheartedly agree, this is truly the story of the man who was the `fire in the night' when the world was becoming dark with fascism.<br />Seth J.

This book claims that the Jewish faith has been abducted by orthodox Judaism and corrupted through the use of the Talmud and other religious texts.  Unfortunatly the exivdence is lax and mostly unsubstantiated.  Many of the footnotes are quotes come from 'eminent historians' but these 'primary sources' turn out to be nothing more then Jewish converts to christianity, writing about why they left their religion.  Anyone will recognize the frequently the most fanatical people are the converts, and thus these sources are weak at best, lies at worst.  This book makes many offensive claims and beyond the claims its contention that modern Judaism is far seperated from the original faith is not proved.  This book does not hide its anti-semitism, rather many quotes clearly show that the authors approved of pogroms in eastern europe and the writing here clearly argues that terror is not only good but is actually totally acceptable.

This book ignores 100% its subject, which is the 'dispersion of Egyptian Jewry'.  Instead this book spends its time bashing Israel and then blaming the Egyptian Jews when they were rounded up, abused, tortured and jailed, for what crime?  For the crime of daring to be Jewish.  This book never mentions half the events that took place with Egyptian Jewry following 1948, which is sopposed to be the basis of the text.  This book, because of its political hatred of Israel, abuses the history of Egyptian Jewry in order to lash Israel, a tragedy of history and a tragedy on the subject.<br />Seth J.

This book ignores the truth and ignores many other facts sourounding the unfortunate event.  This book sadly, and regrettably, completely ignores the similar massacres of the Etzion Block where 100s of Jewish civilians were also murdered.  Hopefully a second edition of this work will carry the name 'twin massacres' Dier Yassin and The Etzion Block.  But until then this book will be a biased account of  a controversial episode, one that has been blown out of all proportion.	2004-02-16

This book lifts the veil off the lefts argument that communism was a benign force that simply wanted workers rights.  The truth is portrayed here in brutal detail.  From Stalins mass murder of millions of Russians in the Gulag to the horrors of Cambodia, the genocide of Vietnam, the work camps in Cuba, the terror in North Korea, basically this book sheds light on the stain that was communism, no matter how many people were taken in and believed the people were being helped this book shows clearly the truth, that communism succeeded in doing only one thing:  killing more then 20 million civilians during the 20th century.  Communism ruined the economies of the countries it took over, it destroyed the standard of living the people had and then it killed off the people who dared to disagree and it killed of the very workers who dared to actually want to vote or have any form of free speech or religion. The insidious nature of communistic ideal is brought to light here in this fascinating read, this wonderful translation.  Communism was THE threat to the world in this century and this book tells this history of this threat and shows how, had communism won, the world would have fallen victim to similar atrocities.  Luckily the western democracies with America in their lead stood up to the fascist ideology of communism.  A must read!!!<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-02-13

Although some would argue that the Eskimos have retained their independence, the truth is that Ishi was an amazing person simply because he remained true to his lifestyle, not affected by the outside chaos of invading euro-American cultures.  Ishi was a California Indian, living on land that had once been perhaps the most heavily populated Native American lands in the United States.  Unlike the Indians in `Last of the Dogmen' he didn't live in some secretive enclave of hold out Indians, ala Machu Pichu, but instead he was all alone, perhaps more sad then romantic.  And this wonderful book explores Ishi, his story and his `brain'.  It explores the nature and character and extraordinary story of Americas last truly Native American.  A terrible testimony to a lost culture and lost way of life.  A very necessary update on the famous, but not well known, story of Ishi.<br />The greatest downside of this telling is that it is too much narrative and not enough history.  This is a shame because the story of Ishi is fascinating without the unnecessary personal jibes.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-02-12

Capitlizing on interest in feminism and the Bible these essays serve up a cold plat eof fabrication and misinformation, mostly detailing the life of Dinah and her relations with other women of the tribe of Joseph, unfortunatly Dinah comes off as a harlot, and her friends as Pagans and idolworshipers full of a mishmash of psuedo-pagan religions, none of which actually existed at the time of Jacob but this book simply fakes these other religions pretending that the women in the Red Tent would have resorted to heathen barbarism when not in the presence of Jacob and his sons.  The reality is that no acts of human sacrifice or the bleeding of cats took place among the women of Jacobs family and since none took place this read is mere conjecture.	2004-02-12

A great diversity of Jewish thought on what it means to be Jewish and how Daniel Pearls last words mean something to them.  But regardless of its many insights and fascinating thoughts this book has several flaws and drawbacks.  This book was supposed to serve as kind of a eulogy to the heroism of reporter Daniel Pearl, but one has to wonder what exactly is being done here.  Although some of the stories here are interesting many of them are not that great and although some new ideas are expressed and new passions of faith explored, in the end this book leaves you wondering `why?'.  It's not clear what the message has to do with Daniel Pearl and it's not really clear why many of the short `I am Jewish' statements were included.  It's not even clear who the audience was intended to be.  Was it supposed to be fellow Jews?  Was it supposed to make Jews understand how important their faith is, and he great diversity within their religion, or was it intended for non-Jews to help them understand the essentially Jewish outlook on life.  Is this a call for tolerance?  And if it is then tolerance by whom of who?  Daniel Pearl was tolerant, he went to Pakistan under the wrong impression that if he presented himself as a journalist trying to understand the struggle of the `freedom fighters' then they would open up.  But instead the `freedom fighters'(terrorists) only saw Mr. Pearl as a Jew and they killed him because in their warped view of the world by killing a Jew they were getting back at Israel or America.  But probably the only truth that Pearls life shows is that no matter how much you are tolerant of the intolerant the intolerant never become tolerant. Their was nothing to learn about terrorists, unless its their location so they can be targeted for extinction.  But that message, sadly, is not made in this book.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-02-12

This short read is full of pictures and diagrams that try to walk the reader through the mysteries of Kaballah, explaining the many aspects of it and illuminating its basics to the reader.  The problem here is that the book does not give a full picture of Kabalistic works.  The Zohar, one of the prime texts of Kaballah, is not shown to be a biblical commentary, which is it, but rather this book portrays Kaballah almost as if it were Yoga or some esoteric mystical faith, not founded securely in Jewish thought and religion.  Probably this book might be a bare minimum of introduction but it requires more reading for one to appreciate what Kaballah really means. Danny Matt's 'Zohar' is a for more acceptable read.	2004-02-12

In successive chapters the author provides a blow by blow account of the many problems with the current translations of the bible and the book shows that several standards should be employed in Biblical translation.  Emphasis is given here to comparing the statements of Christ in the New testament and how they differ between the many versions of the Bible available:  KSV, NKSV, ASV, NIV etc... This book shows clearly how the attempts of translators to have the `meaning' rather then the `word' of the bible have led to some serious issues, including downright mistranslated text. This book shows the fallacy in those that claim the Bible needs to be translated into `modern forms of speech'.  Behind the movement to translate the bible into increasingly modern forms is a slight arrogance that thinks many cannot understand the bible without it being `down to their level'.  This popularity of ever modern translations makes one wonder whether one day Jesus will be saying `I'm Lovin it' rather then `peace be with you'.

Special clarity is given to many of the fundamental aspects of both.  For instance from the beginning we see these two men, one in his traditional attire and the other in his modern dress.  Most important and interesting is the variety of subjects touched upon and the many citations from the Talmud and Maimonadies among others.  This is an interesting read dealing a with a rarely addressed issue, namely the major disputation betweens to two extremes of Judaism.  The reform position vis-&agrave;-vis womens status and rationalizing the refusal to adhere to some old traditions is explicated here.  Evident here is also the very scholarly nature of orthodox Judaism, and it is a shame the Reform Rabbi was not better versed because he is clearly demolished in many of the arguments and appears to shy away from directly confronting Reinmans points.<br />The great failing here is that it is not entirely topical, the reading gets bogged down in places and there is little to interest the reader and keep the reader involved.  Its interesting that the entire text is presented in letter form, but this also leaves much to be desired.  The men were not overly fastidious in their organization and theirfore the book begins to break down.  A good start and a good idea but the book needs some work.  Really whats needed is a book written by both a reform, conservative and orthodox rabbi explaining the key differences in their practices and adherences.	2004-02-03

This Russian leader emerged after the fall of gorbachev and his star rose quickly.  In subsequent Duma elections his right wing nationalistic party gained a good following and many in the west feared that Russia would become a right wing reactionary state.  But Zhironovsky's brand of politics quickly faded and this books outdated analysis shows through.  Zhironovsky was best known for a stunt in which he arrived at the Duma dressed in an army uniform, conjuring up images of Hitler, Mussulini and Franco who had done the same.  Yet other scandals followed as Zhirinovsky's ties to Saddam Hussien came to light and his denial of his Jewish heritage also hurt him among his many anti-Semitic followers.  In the end Zhirinovsky is an interesting personae but he is not the rising hobgoblin portrayed in this book.	2004-02-03

This amazing treatment of the Gulf War and its importance does not focus on the ground offensive that retook Kuwait, instead it focuses on the battle of Khafji, in which three Iraqi divisions invaded Saudi Arabia and were destroyed by the combined arms tactics and technology that would prove so efficient days later when the Coalition launched their own offensive.  What makes this book so amazing and its focus on this event unique is that the author argues this event, more then the later campaign, was the turning point in the war. It was at Khafji that the American army, which had not won a large battle since Inchon, faced the `ten foot tall' giants of Iraq and watched as the Iraqi army was destroyed.  Previously the `speed bumps' of American soldiers along the Iraqi border felt that they could easily be brushed aside, but this battle taught them that regardless of the Iraqi armies veteran status and its triumph over Iran and Kuwait it was no match for the new technologies arrayed against it.<br />Probably the unspoken but obviously poignant statement of this book is that it illuminates the truth about the Gulf War.  Many have argued that America and the coalition did not give the `sanctions' time to create a `peaceful solution'. This book shows the Iraq was going for the prize, namely the southern oil fields of Saudi, just beyond the abandoned coastal city of Khafji.  Had American troops and technology not been in place, the Iraqi army would have destroyed Saudi and Americas oil lifeline.  Those who argue that Saddam wanted a `peaceful solution' are proved wrong in this epic account.<br />The writing is superb, the action is intense and there is no history of the Gulf War that compares in any way to this masterful account.<br />Seth J.

This book paints a picture of `action groups' and congressman who wanted to remain behind the veil of isolationism, pretending the worlds problems had nothing to do with America.  Meanwhile FDR was girding for war, enforcing sanctions on Japan and rebuilding an American army that was the smallest of the western democracies.  The isolationists remained adamantly against intervention as states fell to fascism, Spain, Italy Germany and then Poland, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Serbia, the low countries, France and Norway, until all of Europe was under fascist rule.  Meanwhile in Asia the states of China, and southeast Asia likewise fell.  But this book argues that isolationism was the correct stance.  Unfortunately this book is simply wrong in its assessment.  Had the isolationists won then the world would all be either speaking German or Russian. This book advocates keeping the wool over ones eyes even as the fire is burning down the house.  A better selection would be the book `Alone' about Winston Churchill by Mr. Manchester.	2004-02-02

This book tries to argue that anti-Semitism has a logical basis, the basis being that somehow Jews, simply because they are a group, deserve to be discriminated against.  The argument is so illogical as to betray understanding, since one could simply replace Jew with any ethnic group: Chinese, African-American etc, and draw the same moronic conclusions.<br />This books central theme is trying to portray a scholarly analysis of Jewish behavior and how that behavior has made Jews both successful and targets of attacks.  Yet the analysis has several major flaws.  The book tries to pass off as scholarship a reasoning that says Jews have been mean to gentiles and that Jews therefore somehow deserved anti-Semitism.  This analysis ignores something central.  It is true that Jews, having moved to Europe during the Roman occupation in the first century A.D, began to cultivate certain habits of intermarriage and religious cohesion.  Because Jews lived all over the old Roman empire they became perfect intermediaries for trade and eventually became involved in Academia and Banking, two strains that would give anti-Semites much powder for their arguments.  Yet these traits are not in themselves explanatory of the ingrained, institutionalized hatred that some on the west had for Judaism.  The Europeans accused Jews of being capitalists and communists.  They accused Jews of both `sticking together' and `putting their heads where they don't belong'.  They accused Jews of being both `religious fanatics' and `secular atheists'.  Well how is it possible that all these accusations are true, certainly this book does not reconcile the fact that the accusations against Jews in Anti-Semitism have little factual basis and are more the creation of anti-Semites, who love to find worldwide conspiracies.<br />This books Pseudo-scholarship is not really worthy of its subject.  The author quotes many sources that supposedly portray anti-gentilism within Judaism, but the truth is no such thing exists.

Books	2	3	26	N	N	Misguided analysis	This book, a critical assault on America's invasion of Iraq and its aftermath, makes many wrongheaded conjectures.  The worst mistake made in this book is its many assertions that the war in Iraq has lead to a weakening of America influence in the Middle east. In Iran the youth are pro-American and the Clerics will soon be thrown from office.  Libya is giving up its arms. The Turks are fighting terror.  The Syrians have been bumbled.  The Pakistanis are cooperating and arresting the people the funded only five years ago, the Taliban.  The invasion of Iraq has lessoned American need for Saudi oil, so on the final analysis the war in Iraq has actually reversed decades of American embarrassment in the Arab world, from the hostages in Iran in 1979 to the Beirut crises of 1982.  The reality, not found in this book, is that American power is gaining in the Middle east and America is changing the agenda of many nations in the region.  This critical account simply doesn't pass muster due to the wide range of facts against it.	2004-01-29

The author, in this very reticent, imaginative, and honest book diagnoses the wider impact of terrorism and its newfound importance.<br />There were times in the past when great civilizations were struck down by zealotry.  Rome was destroyed by massive immigrations of barbarians, from Goths to Huns to Vandals and others Rome was swamped and its empire destroyed in a short period of a 100 years prior to which it had been the controller of the known world.  The fall of Rome ushered in unbridled savagery and a period of de-civilization.  The same can be compared to the situation today and so argues this book.  Today the western European powers, fat and rich, have given up their empires in the hopes of a peaceful world and the tolerance of the West has encouraged the boldness of terror.  Already twice in the 20th century the world was threatened by zealotry, first by Nazism and then by Communism and now the new threat is Terrorism and the exponents of hatred towards the freedom found in the western democracies.<br />This book does not necessarily see the total picture of the terrible cataclysm facing the world and it does not critique the western powers enough for their lazy approach to policy but it does diagnose the direct threat and the coming war between civilization and its enemies.<br />Seth J.

But the title is deceiving as the book is in fact not a Bible at all, it is just a collection of disorganizaed poetry and documents, none of which seem to form a story or a biblical narrative.  In some ways the setup mirrors the Qur'anic setup where seemingly unrelated passages are jumbled together but at least the Qur'an as reason(its longest to Shortest in Surah's), this `Bible' is not a bible but just a collection of unimportant little readings.  The Gnostics and Gnosticism was a very important movement in the first centuries after Christ and this `Bible' does not do them justice.

According to this book America was just to hard on this person.  Although the main character had gained vast sums of wealth due to a previous book he had sold America hadn't given him enough.  Although he had benefited from affirmative action and other quota systems it wasn't enough, in the end this book is about failure and whining.  This book is about someone who wanted everything for free and wanted everything on a silver platter and when it didn't arrive they cried `racism' and abandoned their country because supposedly some little carribean hideway was blind to racial aspects.  Of course the little carribean hamlet is only `blind' because no diversity exists on it and there are few other people living on the island the main character moves too.  A very disappointing book about someone who is just a quitter, although he claims to be disillusioned and let down and suppressed, maybe he should go to former soviet Russia and see real suppression then he might not take America for granted.

This wonderful account details the back story of the various super-rich who came to dominate Russian Industry from Yukos to Aeroflot and the Russian Central Bank, from oil to automobiles.

The Torah, oft commented on but rarely successfully explained, is not illuminated here and in fact many of the 'asides' and 'comments' seem far to laid back and far to unprofessional to really meet the muster required of a biblical commentary carrying any weight.  such lines as 'the holiest of holies' take away and transport the reader into popular history, from which the reader never emerges.  A biblical commentary should be of the highest most professional nature and its points should be clear, but this edition skips over essential debates due to the authors disinterest or, perhaps, ill knowledge.  For instance the 'Rape of Dina' is totally glossed over and none of its ramifications are illuminated.  Why was Dina Raped and what was gods judgment on the vengeance?  Did Dina love the prince of Shachem?  This commentary does the bare minimum although it seems to spend more time on other items, for instance the Dietary Laws.  This is by far one of the least impressive commentaries that can be found on the Torah, far better ones can be found, unless you value the laid back nature of it, then you will be happily pleased.	2004-01-26

The book claims to address the \\"six million myth\\" and claims the holocaust did not happen and then goes on to claim that Hitler never intended to kill any Jews or other minorities.  This terrible lie also tries to pull the blind over the eyes of the reader by claiming that the evidence for the holocaust is mostly either mistranslated or made up.  Well what about the thousands of personal accounts.  What about the hundreds of accounts by Doctors who personally saw the gas chambers and worked in them?  What about the pictures and the mass graves uncovered.  Can a picture of thousands of bodies recently gassed lie?  Can the aerial photographs showing groups of naked people being herded into a gas chamber lie?  Can the smuggled photos of the gas chambers lie?  Can the design blueprints captured in the war lie?  No.  This book is a terrible tragedy, terrible piece of anti-Semitism that purports to criticize Israel by denying the Holocaust, as if the Holocaust was the sole reason for the creation for Israel, which is not the case.<br />The next major lie in this book regards Zionism which the book compares to Fascism.  The reality is that Zionism was a nationalistic pro-Jewish movement that wanted a homeland for the Jews so they could protect themselves against the anti-Semetic whims of the European regimes.  The Zionists considered Uganda and Vietnam before settling on Israel, so the authors contention that it was a racist movement that relied on `obscure biblical evidence' is false.  Zionists went to Israel because the English and even the Arab king Hussein invited them.  A terrible fabrication this book should only be read so one can understand modern Anti-Semitism and Holocaust Denial.	2004-01-23

The basic argument here is that throughout history, since 70 A.D to be exact, Jews have tried to embrace government so as to be protected by it.  As the weakest and more discriminated against people in Europe Jews frequently worked in the courts of Kings.  When communism and socialism wee being Born this book shows how Jews worked to establish the Soviet in Russia and fought in the Spanish civil war.  In America Jews quickly embraced the more tolerant state, aiding on both sides of the civil war and occupying a seat on the supreme court for more then a century.<br />The question this book asks is:  Has the Jewish alliance with the state proved to be a fatal tactic?  Examples of the expulsion from Spain in 1492 and the Stalinist purges of Jews in Russia seem to be prime example.  But the book does not address the fact that in the middle eastern countries Jews had no status and frequently existed with no alliance to the state and yet the Jews of the middle east were also suppressed, pogromed, and sometimes expelled.  Jews of the middle east, despite the fact that they were not visible were still hated and they were forced to wear distinctive embarrassing clothes and were restricted from riding horses and forced to work on the Sabbath.  So the conclusion should be that it really doesn't matter whether Jews embrace or shun the state, either way we will be at risk and the reality is that at least by embracing the state Jews have gotten a measure of power to help influence government so that it is harder for government sanctioned anti-Semitism to take place.	2004-01-23

Here the book examines the recent pogroms in France where religious Jews were assaulted whenever they ventured onto the street and Jewish centers were bombed, although not reported, this rise in evil is clearly shown to be the shame that now overhangs Europe.<br />The book draws two major reasons for the rise in anti-Semitism.  First the author explores the Arab-Israeli conflict and shows how the catharsis of anti-Zionism has grown into full blown hatred through the government sponsored publication of Elders of Zion by many regimes such as Saudi and Egypt.  Then the book looks at the fact that many leftist Europeans us Israel as an excuse to be anti-Semitic, in affect attacking the holocaust survivors so as to remove themselves from the shame of not preventing the Holocaust.  This two pronged offensive is uncovered in this excellent book which rivals in its directness the `Never Again' work of Foxman.  A must read for anyone interested in Intolerance, diversity, anti-Semitism, Islam or Israel.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2004-01-22

The book sets out to look at fundamentalism and its violent nature.  But wait a sec there are no violent fundamentalist Christians or Jews that exist today.  There are no Jewish or Christian terrorists today.  So in order to balance the book and not make it simply a laundry list of Islamic terror the author creates Christian and Jewish terror by claiming `Jewish and Christian fundamentalism is involved in terror as well'.  But history proves this wrong.  When is the last time a Jewish or Christian fundamentalist hijacked an airplane?  Never.  When is the last time a Jewish or Christian fundamentalist strapped a bomb on and blew up a bus?  Never.  So this argument doesn't pass muster.  In the past their have been extreme Christian sects and the book is correct in this analysis.  The book is weak in trying to talk about `violent Judaism'.  What violence?  3500 b.c was the last time Jewish tribes went romper-stumper on their neighbors in a fundamentalist manner.  But this book claims Israel's wars are fundamentalist, unfortunately the author never realized the IDF and Israel is a socialist secular nation like France.  So this book is a fabrication because the author didn't want to admit the only fundamentalists who are violent today are Islamicsts, the terrorists.  The book doesn't tell the truth about intolerance and hate in the middle east, instead it covers up terror by accusing Christianity of hate.  A typical tactic.	2004-01-22

It bills itself as an attempt to 'build a bridge' so that people can understand violence is not the norm in Islam.  The book claims that fundamental extremism and its popularity is due to the 'population explosion' in Islamic countries but this is not true.  The Iranian youth of today are secular and hate the Ayatollahs, it was only in 1979 that they were all fundamentalist.  The author refers to the Mohamad as the 'Prophet' but this is innaccurate.  Any biogrpahy should explore the true life of a person.  How often do you see biogrpahies of Jesus called 'jesus: The son of God' no, because that would betray that duty of the book to investiage the actual events.  This book is perfect for the apologist because it white washes the truth about the Badr offensive, the selling into slavery of the tribes of Medina and other such acts that took place around 632.  A very suspect account written by someone who is obsessed with only the good sides of Mohomads life and a book that does not cirtique or even try to tell the truth.	2004-01-22

But what false image are we talking about?  The author claims that many Muslims, especially in America, have obtained high roles as politicans and business leaders and that theirfore the idea of Islamic terrorist is false.  But the problem is that it is not false.  The terrorists of Sept 11th really did live in America.  They did train in America.  They really did kill 3000 Americans.  So this book should have been more honest in realizing their are many images of the Islamic faith from the ultra-orthodox to the religiously moderate to the apostate and the terrorist.  This book is a shame.	2004-01-22

First the book is basically the history of God from the Islamic viewpoint although it pretends to be open minded.  The chapter on Judaism claims that Judaism was created by monotheists and pagans when the truth it that it was not. Judaism was created when Abraham was helped by G-d in the desert and G-d aided Abraham in creating a nation of people.  This book claims that the Christian apostles were epileptics when no such evidence exists.  In fact the apostles were real men, mostly from the lowers classes, who met and followed Jesus and agreed to aid his ministry.  Why does this book attack and defame two of the religions it is trying to understand while casting no critique on the third religion, Islam.  The chapter on Islam says `Mohomed, the prophet' and that's the end of it, no questioning, no critique no `was mohomad an epileptic'.  How blatantly biased.<br />This book is not a history of God, it is a history of God according to a disillusioned Christian who now believed in Islam.  The author claims that the Islamic word for God can be both male and female but the book does not point out the exact same is true for the word G-d in Hebrew and the early Christian versions of the bible.  Only when the bible was translated into English did G-d become `he'(not the male form but the non-gender form).  This book is a total fabrication when it comes to citing Hebrew scripture and it ignores what it was supposed to be exploring: the history of god, instead it becomes a polemic against Christianity and Judaism.  Not worth the read unless you're a Muslim or a feminist.	2004-01-22

Early works on the Yom Kippur war suffered due to secrecy on both sides of the conflict.  Later works, like Blums 'eve of destruction' are narrow in their outlook and focus usually on only one or two elements of the conflict.  This masterful work focuses on the entire conflict.  From AMAN's intelligence failures to the planning for operation Badr to the 'last temple' statements of Mr. Dayan.  Here is blow by blow coverage of the minor skirmishes and the large battles as well as day to day accounts of the fate of the men along the Bar-Lev line.  The Yom Kippur War has long been relegated to the Sack Heap of history, a seminal conflict ignored in the broader context of the Arab Israeli wars.  Usually it plays second fiddle to the `Six Day War' yet the Yom Kippur War was the most fascinating of the conflicts due to its multi-dimensional nature, from the surprise attack to the early setbacks, the airlift and the final world shattering gains in the Golan and across the Suez.<br />Rabinovich is well known for his other work in the Jerusalem Post and he is an acknowledged expert on political and military affairs.  But this book remains a tour de-force of epic proportions.  Simply a very readable, extremely accessible and detailed account.  Scholars of Israeli history as well as those looking for an epic military history book will enjoy this new volume.  Anyone interested in the Arab-Israeli conflict and the modern geography of the middle east will find this book insightful.	2004-01-20

Manji, who is Canadian, calls for a new birth of freedom for Muslim women and through her tale she exposes he truth behind the Koran and behind the radical Wahhibists.  This books passionate argument should not be passed up by anyone interested in the `religion of peace' because it not only exposes the dark underbelly of middle eastern culture but it also is a rallying cry for all the `progressive' Muslims yearning for the education and equal treatment of women.  This is a must read, a wonderful, singular account.  Is their more proof of the accuracy of this book then the fact that the author has received death threats and hate mail?  Obviously those this book targets have something to fear from it due to the many denunciations of it.  A very valuable account.	2004-01-16

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	3	10	105	N	N	Price of disloyalty should have been title	Apparently according to Mr. O'Neil the price of Loyalty was whatever he could make on a book.  His most recent statements of `well I'm rich and old so they cant touch me' led him to write a rambling vindictive account of his time with the Bush administration.  Apparently Mr. O'Neil realized that now was the time to write a book about `scandal' regarding the Bush administration.  If the administration were more popular this book would probably detail how wonderful a time O'Neil had.  Either way this account is weak, flimsy and mostly just conjecture.  One the one hand this book explains how O'Neil was frequently ignored during meetings and how his time alone with the President frequently amounted to O'Neil talking and their being no response.  The book claims that this shows the president didn't care or wasn't involved.  Yet at the same time the account also claims that there was a vast conspiracy to invade Iraq.  Wait a sec.  If O'Neil was being ignored and no one spoke to him in the meetings then how was he privy to the inner machinations of the cabinet?  It can't be both ways.  This account claims that although they wouldn't discuss monetary policy with the treasury secretary they did, in fact, discuss secret foreign initiatives with the secretary.  It simply doesn't jive, either they shared everything with him or they shared nothing, it can't be both ways.  Therefore this book comes off more as the ramblings of a disgruntled employee then of a reasoned account of the treasury department.  Probably this book is an `inside look' at the Bush white house but it is written by someone, who like Stephanopolous, is trying to capitalize on his 15 minutes of disgruntled dissident fame.<br />Seth J.

In many ways the author seems to look at Lebanon as if it was the Post-Civil war south where racist gangs went on rampages.  In 1860 Lebanon apparently was going through a similar foreign intervention of carpet baggers in the form of Europeans whose investments were enriching the Maronites and therefore upsetting the delicate ethnic balance between Druze and Maronite.  The problem is that this balance had been based on Islamic supremacy, and that was the only thing the Druze would allow.  Jealousy and a fear that Muslims might actually end up poorer then their Christian neighbors led the Druze to go on a rampage murdering as many as a hundred thousand Christians, they were only stopped in their genocide by international intervention.  In many respects the popular action of genocide in Lebanon presaged the Armenian massacres of 1915, the Assyrian massacres of 1920 and the Sikh massacres of 1948, each involved a muslim community committing genocide against an ancient minority community, mostly due to the fact that the world wasnt watching and using societal upheaval and chaos as an excuse.  Yet in Lebanon in 1860 the international community did notice and intervened.  But in the end all this did was postpone the genocidal conflict until the 1980s when new terrorists would go on new rampages and kill another 100,000 Christians while the world ignored the conflict and the media in fact aided and abbeded the terrorists by calling it a civil war when their was nothing civil about it and the war entailed a superior majority rounding up a  an unarmed minority and killing them all.  This book, like so many of its ilk, is biased and flawed but it is one of the few on the subject.	2004-01-13

So basically this book claims that to understand and even critique is racist.  The main theme is 'how dare the west critique'.  Well isn't Mr. Said critiquing, maybe this book should realize its utter hypocrisy to say 'how dare you critique us' on the one hand while then critiquing the west on the other.  according to this volume the great flaw in the west is that it dared to try to understand the east, well maybe it would be better if we just remained ignorant of it.	2004-01-13

Now that being said this book combines all the looney left into one big sausage pie.  Here you find Nader, Huffington, Moore, Molly Ivins and Paul Krugman and other luminaries.  And they are at least honest, they have hate in their hearts and here they belt it out. Probably the only one duped into this book was Mr. Dershowitz who probably didnt realize he would end up in the middle of anti-semites like Mr. Moore.<br />A very sad commentary on american politics. The book should have been titles 'a national critique: how Bush's america is an injustice' or something like that, benign and possibly honest.  Instead this book uses a brash semi-fascist title to get hateful leftists to buy it.

Foremost among these prior to this book was Netanyahu's Fighting Terrorism. This book sits atop the heap in its very cogent analysis of the ways in which terror must be confronted, fought and finally crushed. Through separate chapters and many 'Items' this book weaves a web around the nature, practice and final end to modern terror. Libya, Saudi, Iran and North Korea are given special attention. The pacifists who want to surrender America to the Burkhaizers are condemned and their mission of giving in to evil is condemned. This book is a wonderful assessment written by two of America's foremost policy experts. However, lost from this are several key points. For instance; the authors do not thoroughly investigate other examples of how terror has been fought or defeated, where they should have analyzed Israel and Algeria's experiences. Also there is no real analysis of the role of Preemption in the war on terror, even though this policy has been inaugurated by Mr. Wolfowitz, a colleague of the authors. A good addition to any current events reading, you will not be disappointed. Probably the largest problem however is the title 'an end to evil'.  There will always be evil and there will always be terrorists.  This is why the book probably should have elaborated on how to actually crush terror while acknowledging that terror is something that will most likely go away.  Nevertheless this remains he most current, most up-to-date insiders account of the current policy on terror and how that policy can be better implemented.	2004-01-09

It illuminates the conflict and brings to life the many pivotal portions of the struggle, from Bloody Sunday to the hunger strikes and the final peace deals that have finally taken the gun out of Irish politics, something Michael Collins dreamed of long ago.<br />The largest problem and greatest fallacy of this book is that it is terribly biased and one sided which one could probably gather from its name.  An example of this can be seen in the chapter on Bloody Sunday, a seminal event which mirrored Americas own Kent State protests that resulted in the deaths of students.  The problem is the author, after having written that the marchers threw `rocks' and `bottles' at the Police, then goes on to call the marchers `non-violent'.  Wait a sec!  Nonviolent means not being violent it doesn't mean throwing rocks and bottles.  This is just one of the many examples where the IRA is portrayed as fighting for civil rights while at the same time they are blowing up civilians.  What happened to the civil rights of those civilians.  If you want a less biased account I would recommend Tim Pat Coogan's `The IRA'.  This book has its merits in that it works hard to distinguish between the Provisional IRA and the other branches within the framework.  An interesting account, but not the most fair in telling the truth of the conflict.<br />Seth Frantzman	2004-01-09

Here is a book that finally tells the whole story about Eisenhowers defense team and its use of espionage and covert ops to stop and roll back communism the world over.  Ike was a confrontationalist, not a d&eacute;tente' man.  This book, by the very esteemed popular Historian Mr. Ambrose, helps to convey the wide range of activities.  From the planning of the Bay of Pigs to the overthrow of the Iranian and Guatemala governments Ike brought America to pinnacle of Cold War politics, daring to confront the communists in the same manner they confronted the third world, namely armed intervention.

The author begins with a general introduction to what he intends to accomplish his work.  The bulk of the work focus's on Ben Gurion and the politics of the Yishuv from 1945-1949.  Here the book does a wonderful job in navigating the many challenges Gurion faced as he first confronted the English then courted the Americans, the Russians  and finally faced up the fact of an Arab invasion.<br />This wonderful book does something that few, if any, have done before; It analyzes the other political parties in Israel and their various methods and ideas for the creation of the State.  From the radical left to the radical right each political faction is given separate attention and its goals, methods and ideas are investigated.  The final portion of the book deals with the `New Historians' and the debunking of certain ideas for instance the Refugee Issue and the `David vs. Goliath' issue that many modern Historians have used to critique and castigate Israel.  The simple thesis is that the 1948 war must be analyzed from a standpoint of the conditions of 1948 rather then looking at it from the standpoint of today and critiquing the Yishuv for the mistakes of modern Israeli PMs.	2004-01-08

A very interesting combination of scholarship and sweeping popular history.  The countries covered include Syria, Israel, Egypt, Iraq and Lebanon.  The rest of the middle east, although mentioned intermittedly is ignored.  Many usually forgotten episodes are illuminated here.  For instance special coverage is given to Kings Faisal and Hussein.  Coverage is also given to the oft ignored genocide committed against the Christian Assyrians by the Iraqis and special reference compares it to the similar genocide against the Armenians following World War Two.  The author gives coverage to Mr. Antonious's assertion of an `Arab Awakening' and the birth of the Muslim Brotherhood and Ba'athist movements is given attention.  Of special interest is the coverage given to the drawing and re-drawing of the middle East's maps thus creating problems that persist to this day.  This is the thesis of the volume, namely that western interference in the mapping of the middle east and politics of the middle east has created many of the problems that exist to this day.  This is not entirely proved since organizations like the Ba'athists and the Pan-Arabism of Nasser were home grown ideologies that borrowed from European Social ideals.  In the end probably the greatest left-overs of the foreign involvement in the middle east is the Kingdom of Jordan, which was a figment of British imagination that has taken hold.<br />Seth J.

This book intends to expose the `cover-up' of the British disasters in the Zulu war and the author tries to prove that their was indeed some massive cover up.  Of course the cover up couldn't have been very thorough since everyone with any knowledge of British colonial history knows the the defeat by the Zulus.  This book claims the british were crushed despite their superior weaponry but this is a misnomer.  The British were defeated due to their lesser then brilliant officers who strong the better trained and better armed british contingent out in a long line, allowing the british regulars to be butchered by the vastly more numerous Zulus.  The author claims that it was a failure of British arms.  But Isandlwana is no more a failure of British arms then the defeat the British suffered in Afghanistan or at Yorktown.  Rather, the reality is that the gigantic Zulu army went on to lay siege to Rorkes Drift where a handful of similar British soldiers held off thousands of Zulu for more then a day.  Isandlwana was a freak accident and this book labors too hard to show that the British covered up a defeat.	2004-01-06

This book includes everything.  It looks at the origins of the tribes of the Jews and their founding in fire of the original kingdom of Israel.  It explains why the zealots took to the hills to fight most of the great powers of the day from Assyria to Rome.  The author gives a wonderful tour of the Diaspora, life under the Christians and intolerance under the Muslims.  Special chapters deal with Yiddish and the life of `Jews in Exotic Places' like Ethiopia, China and India.  Separate chapters also look at the Holocaust as well as Jewish resistance in World War Two and Jewish life in the United States.  Of course the birth of the state of Israel makes up the last portion of the book.  The only downside is a total lack of maps and the loss of essential chapters detailing Judaism in places like South America and Russia.  Nevertheless this is a wonderful book which includes much poetry and literary sources as well as personal insights and experiences.	2004-01-06

A far better account can be found in `The Seventh Million' by Mr. Segev.  This book tries to critique efforts by elderly Jews to reclaim that which was stolen from them in the Holocaust and the author insinuates that men like Simon Wiesenthal have been trying to lay their hands on money in the name of Jewish victims for selfish reasons.  Yet the reasons are not selfish.  The money that people like Mr. Wiesenthal have gotten has gone to good causes like tracking down Nazis and telling the story of the Holocaust to new generations.  Probably the only highlight of this book is that it illuminates the dearth of scholarship and interest in the Holocaust prior to 1967 when America and Israel became obsessed with the Holocaust.  The book makes the ludicrous assertion that it is wrong that Americans know more about the Holocaust then they do about the Civil War, thus perpetuating the hateful claims of Mr. Vidal that Jews are `un-american'.  This is where the book fails and borders on becoming anti-semetic.  A disappointment.	2004-01-06

In the Red Tent we are supposedly told the story from Dinah's point of view and apparently learn the true life of the women in the bible.  Apparently this is to make up for the lack of women in the bible.  Unfortunatly this thesis is false, the Torah and Tanakh abound with strong women(unlike other holy books).  Remember Deborah who gathered her armies or Esther who saved the Jews or Judith who cut the head of Holofernes.  Now the Red Tent's main problem is its obsession with Paganism, almost as if the author set out to make fun of the Torah and monotheism.  This is terribly insulting and ruins the story because it makes this book seem overtly political, an assault on religion.<br />The most fantastic parts of this book include the distortions.  The Bible tells of Jacobs long 7 years of work to marry his wives yet this book makes it 7 months.  Why?  To fit the feminist narrative and make Jacob seem a small brutish male.  Next the book distorts the story of Dinah.  Dinah is only mentioned briefly in the bible and she is mentioned as a victim of a rape, her brothers in turn raze the city to the ground where the rapists originated.  But in the `Red Tent' Dinah says she enjoyed the rape, this typical feminist twist is odd because it almost indicates that rape should not be punished and in fact that Dinah wanted to be raped because she `went out'.  This caustic analysis harms the story and casts further insult upon the Biblical narrative.  The use of Paganism in the `Rent Tent' is a totally fabricated incident, insinuating that all Jewish women worshipped dozens of gods and not the `god of jacob'.  Meanwhile the pagan gods run the gamit, some never existed at the time of Jacob and some were involved in child sacrifice, so why didn't the women in the tent sacrifice Dinah? If the author wanted to write a book glorifying rape and paganism then why didn't she just make up a story why did she fabricate and assault a biblical text?and assault a biblical text?	2004-01-02

The essays are called `bold' but the reality is that disagreeing with the Vietnam war isn't exactly revolutionary.  No original thought is found within these essays instead they are the typical `America is evil' mentality.  One essay in particular focuses on the war in Laos and Cambodia but it ignores the Vietnamese invasions of these countries and the destabilizing influence that Vietnamese troops caused as they rampaged through the rice fields of Cambodia in order to invade South Vietnam.  The reality is that these essays completely ignore and in fact deny the truth about Pol Pots regime in Cambodia, a communist regime that killed 25% of the country and especially murdered minority groups and Muslims.  These glaring anti-factuals make this collection hard to accept and even harder to digest.  Fans of the authors previous work will be delighted, while most will be unhappy.	2003-12-31

It used to be in Europe people blamed Jews for sucking the blood of children, and that was the excuse to go on a good old fashioned Pogrom. Today the media invents a new Blood Libel, in the form of saying the Jews go out nightly and suck the blood of nice peace loving palistinians.<br />Lets get the argument strait here. Almost everyday a palistinian enters a civilian place and murders Israeli civilians. In the last ten years some thousands of Israelis have been killed by terror, these are Israeli civilians, not military people. The palistinains claim they are fighting for freedom, fighting a war against a brutish oppressor. Apparently the war must be fought against civilians, civilians who go to work everyday and never even see palistinians.<br />Lets get the argument strait. The authors claim the palistinians are suffering a 'holocaust'. Holocaust as a word was first applied to the systematic extermination of 1/3 of the worlds Jews. Now lets see, have 1/3 of the palistinians been rounded up, gassed and cremated? hmmm, no. In the worst years of the Israeli palistinian conflict about 800 palistinians are killed and 500 Israelis. So isn't the 'holocaust' mutual. Even if every palistinian killed was a civilian(when in truth most are holding weapons as they are shot down) it still wouldn't be a<br />'holocaust' since palistinians target Israeli civilians.<br />This book is anti-semetic trash aimed at enraging readers and having them hate Israel, and don't kid yourselves by hating Israel, you are an anti-semite. Its the same thing. This book accuses the IDF of intentionally killing and suppressing the palistinians.	2003-12-31

Here are essays that `confront' large corporations and so-called `pogroms' against the Muslims of India.  First the corporations are the only reason India isn't poorer then it is.  If it wasn't for the millions of jobs provided by American corporations like Intel India would be a largely agrarian state with nothing to offer and even more starving poor. In the issue of militarism the essays are totally misfactual. Roy looks at the attacks on Muslims but she totally ignores the mass murder of Hindus in Bangladesh or the Sikhs in Pakistan and she ignores the massacres of Hindus daily in Kashmir who are simply trying to go to their holy places.  Thus the arguments seem to say that the communal violence is only one sided when the reality is that it goes both ways and the essays simply ignore one entire side, a terrible dishonest distortion which betrays its subjects and betrays India.	2003-12-31

Nonetheless these essays include a typical anti-American theme.  The first conclusion, that America is the worlds only superpower and their America is evil is foolish in the extreme.  Since America has not always been the `only superpower' where is the essay critiquing China for being the Superpower of Asia, or Russia for its superpower status from 1945-88?<br />The main fallacy within this books convoluted segments is that most of the essays have no real defining characteristic, they are simply devoid of  any original thinking.  The essays model themselves on `dissent' but the reality is that dissent for dissents sake doesn't make writing interesting or ideas `revolutionary'.  From these essays the conclusion is that any act of terror is legitimate and any act of self defense is unacceptable. Although the books title includes the word `struggle for democracy' no actual struggles are depicted in the collection.  One would think that one essay might illuminate the triumph of democracy in some sub-Saharan African nation but no such work is found here, in fact all the essays focus on how America is a big bully.  In the end the book has no redeeming features and the conclusions are unoriginal.  IF you're a fan of Chomsky you'll no doubt gobble up this tripe with the same relish as you might read `Fateful Triangle' but for those searching for original work you will dismayed.	2003-12-31

Foremost among these prior to this book was Netanyahu's Fighting Terrorism.  This book sits atop the heap in its very cogent analysis of the ways in which terror must be confronted, fought and finally crushed.  Through separate chapters and many `Items' this book weaves a web around the nature, practice and final end to modern terror.  Libya, Saudi, Iran and North Korea are given special attention.  The pacifists who want to surrender America to the Burkhaizers are condemned and their mission of giving in to evil is condemned.  This book is a wonderful assessment written by two of America's foremost policy experts.  However, lost from this are several key points.  For instance; the authors do not thoroughly investigate other examples of how terror has been fought or defeated, where they should have analyzed Israel and Algeria's experiences.  Also there is no real analysis of the role of Preemption in the war on terror, even though this policy has been inaugurated by Mr. Wolfowitz, a colleague of the authors.  A good addition to any current events reading, you will not be disappointed.	2003-12-30

There is also a plethora of literature about the `monster' Milosevic.  Unfortunately few books tell the whole story.  This book is the exception. Written by a noted critic of America and Nato this book exposes the truth behind the Bosnian war.  He explores the so called `Mass Graves' that the U.S used as an excuse to bomb the Serbian people.  He shows how the reality was that Albanians were destroying churches and libraries in Kosovo and murdering civilians while the world community actually conspired to help them.  Millions of innocent Serbs were forced to flee Kosovo and Bosnia in the aftermath of Nato's bombardment.  It was the Serbs that were ethnically cleansed and this book is an in depth investigation into how and why.  Using previously unknown sources and exposing unread media reports the author does a wonderful job.  This is a wonderful book on the Balkans conflict and a necessary protest piece.<br />Seth J.

This book gives a whirlwind tour of Austrian History from 1200-1900.  Then the book slows down and achieves greatness in describing the intricacies of Franz Joseph's rule as well as WWI and the road to Anschloss with Germany.  The book picks up by describing the little know  portion of Austrian history, the post 1945 Austria.  At first divided between the major power Austria then became a `permanently' neutral power, although a power that hosted a controversial leader in the form of Mr. Waldheim, a former Nazi.  The book then covers the `awakening' of Austria as it found itself post cold war.  Although not up to date, it doesn't cover the election of the right wind Jorg Haider, this is an excellent introduction and survey of Austrian history.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2003-12-29

The author tackles several subjects in this hands-on accounts.  The author looks at traditional `man-eaters' although the word itself disturbs him in his politically correct nature, he looks at the Siberian Tigers, the Lions and even the Bears of Rumania.  He looks at the myths surrounding the `man-eaters' and he analyzes the political responses.  He tells wonderful tales of the alligators of Australia and weaves a web of intrigue whereby the reader can now distinguish between the truly lethal `man-eaters' and the skinny snouted harmless critters of the inland streams.  Many stories are interwoven including vast accounts of the natives who like always seem to live `in harmony' with nature.  Only when modern man came along with his weapons and his urban development did the truly viscous kings of the animal kingdom disappear.  The only shortcoming is the small amount of room devoted to wolves and sharks, but obviously the book is such a wonderful gem to only so much could be covered, especially since the account is part travel writing.<br />Seth J.

Although a refreshing account this book contains a number of outright fallacy's.  First of all the story of Abraham is not, in fact, identical for the three faiths.  The most obvious point here is the distinction in Islam of Ishmael who in the Torah/Old Testament is cast away and who god describes as `a wild beast of a man, his hand against all others'.  The question the author raises is `Since Abraham is the father of the three faiths can't he be used as a unifying person to bring understanding'.  In short, No.  Abraham is not the central figure in any of the three faiths.  Judaism has Moses, Christianity has Jesus and Islam has Mohamed.  Abraham is simply a father figure but not a dynamic prophet of god.  He was a shepherd with a small number of followers and a small family.  He frequently lied to local rulers and said his wife was his sister, so that he would not be murdered for her.  His brother, Lot, ended up in a cave and made love to his own daughters.  Abraham circumcised himself at an old age and his wife gave birth when she was 80.  But the parables and stories aside the man, Abraham, is a very human fleshy character and the authors thesis does not hold true.  He is not a unifier, he is simply a beginning, like Adam and Eve or Noah, who are equally nebulous.  In the final result this book does not hold the water is reputes itself to hold.	2003-12-26

The real gem in this book is the nonchalant writing style, the narrative stride of the text and the up to date nature of the history which brings us to the present day.  Covered within these pages are the typical story of Castro's early life, his exile to Mexico, his arrival aboard the Grandma in the Sierra Madre and his victory over Batista.  Also covered are the typical stories of his government, the obsession with sugar, the forays into Latin America and Africa and the ever present `scandals' and persecutions of men like Padilla and Ochoa.  A well written robust account of the life of Fidel and his Cuba.  A superior account can be found in Guerilla Prince, especially for those interested in the foreign policy of the Fidel regime.

A better account and although a work of fiction a more plausible account can be found in Mr. Archers `The fourth of Estate'.  Maxwell had connections with Israels Mossad and he did have many high level contacts in Israel and he was involved in dubious behavior with the Russians but this book goes one step to far and simply creates relationships that did not exist.  Beyond Muckraking this book is mostly fantasy and conjectured accusations that for the Maxwell hator or for the uninformed may well seem accurate but the truth is far more likely to have nothing to do with Maxwell being murdered by the Mossad.  In fact Maxwell simply failed in business and probably committed suicide.  This is an interesting account but should be read with an eye of suspicion.	2003-12-22

From their beginnings as Dutch colonizers to their Brutal wars with the Zulu as they trekked northward to escape British imperialism.  The Dutch of Africa became a hardened and embittered people.  As they grew from a paltry group of colonists to become their own tribe, whose roots in S. Africa predate the migration of the Zulu, they also became hardened against those who wanted to crush them, namely the British and the more viscous of S. Africa natives.  This book tells the tale of a people between two worlds, on one hand the African world of the Natives and the European of the imperialists.  In the end the Afrikaans, being so numerous and having no country to call home could not simply move, the way so many whites did when fleeing black nationalism in Africa.  The Afrikaners became victims of their own situation, although the first to suffer the horrors of the concentration camp, and although a poor and starving people in 1900 they grew to dominate S. Africa, and many opposed helping the English in WWII.  A marvelous account that brings to life the history of the region this is a muct read for anyone interested in Africa, Aparthied or colonialism's consequences.	2003-12-22

A fine account an d a good biography especially for any former reader of Zinn or anyone interested in the revisionism of Zinn.  This book sets out not only to tell the story of the Zinn revolution in American history but also to explain how Zinn is a `true american' and not an `anti-American'.  Of course Mr. Zinn agrees with not one policy that America has ever taken.  Mr. Zinn sympathizes with every foreign power or anyone who has ever attacked or killed Americans from King Phillip to Osama.  Sadly Mr. Zinn's united states would look more like the former soviet union then the America we know.

Unfortunately that was not the case.  This book is a collection of essays from times gone by, from the greatest of the critique's, Mr. Chomsky.  This book details a myriad of subjects, boldly among them the steamship like memorandum on why Mr. Carter and Mr. Reagan were creating a `new cold war.'  The essay was written in the 80s.  Days after the essay was written the Soviet Union collapsed and the cold war ended, forever.  That fact alone should doom this book to obscurity but the other essays are more fascinating, including the interest in East Timor, which would not grace the American media for more then a decade and other essays on a vast array of Subjects.  An interesting volume but the work is heavily outdated.  For a soldier of Chomskyism this book will be another wind in the willows to add to the library and it is a must buy, in fact it will make a wonderful gift for any Chomsky lover.  For those interested in Chomsky's take on the current geopolitical struggle, this book will be very disappointing.	2003-12-22

This narrative history ranges from the first Dutch settlements to the post-apartheid era.  It covers the Great Trek, the Zulu Wars and gives special attention to the harsh treatment of the Afrikaners at the hands of the British during the Boer War, in which many were forced into the worlds first concentration camps.  A very fluid history and one of the only books to focus on the history of the Afrikaners as a people and a culture.  The author is an eminent South African Historian, and an original fighter against Apartheid, yet he argues passionately to explain the reasons the Afrikaners, their nationalists having come to power in 1948, choose apartheid over majority rule.  Important leaders are revealed such as Mr. Smuts, Mr. Botha and Mr. De Klerk as well as insights into Mandela and Mbeki's rule.  A must read for scholars of south Africa and those interested in Apartheid, its creation and consequences.	2003-12-17

A man whose daring and exploration gave Russia claim to Alaska and gave Russians maps that would send them full throttle into Asia, from Kamchatka to the Sakhalin Islands to Port Arthur.  This wonderful new book tells the story of Bering in depth from his first voyage to his tragic death.  A necessary piece of history this will be of interest to anyone who enjoys high adventure and exploration as well as Russian History.  A singular individual, Bering accomplished so much in his life and opened so many doors to what had been a closed Russian society.  Far more then simply the Bering Strait this book sheds light on a whole era, and a whole new episode of history, usually overlooked in our bias for  dashing English explorers like Cook and Scott.<br />Seth Frantzman	2003-12-12

He begins by looking at the history of the Christian church in China, its roots in Protestant and Catholic missionaries.  Throughout he reveals the stories and turning points of the growth of the Chinese church.  This dynamic group of men and women stood against all odds to bring the word of Christ to the people of China.  The author then explores the quick growth and sad repression of Christianity.  In many ways he compares it to the relationship between the Christians and Rome.  Although they were suppressed they finally came to dominate the Roman empire in less then 500 years.  Missionaries have been China for 400.  The author forecasts a massive exponential growth of Christianity, showing how once it becomes 10% of China its rise will be unstoppable.  The final conclusion of the author is that China will become a key ally of the west against militant Islam and that the commitment China have to Christianity will help renew the faith in the west, where church attendance is down dramatically. A very interesting work.  The author helps to remind us that John Birch, who  gave his name to the right wing society, was actually a missionary in China before being murdered by the communists.<br />Seth J.

This book is hard to come across but it is a gem of scholarship, a very inspirational story of faith in the face of evil.  While the catholic church was interested in complying with Hitler Mr. Niemoeller refused to leave the pulpit, his fiery speeches attacked Hitler himself until finally the Nazis took him away.  An amazing man and author of the famous quote they came for the communists and I was not a communist..

As most anyone interested in biblical scholarship is aware the five books of Moses comprise the Torah and the number of Hebrew letters in the Torah has always remained the same since it was first recorded into its present form.  Thus one can be assured that when you read the bible(whether it be the Hebrew, Catholic or King James) you are receiving the same stories, with some translation difference in English.  The question this book delves into is the question of how the Torah came to be and why so many contradictions and repetitions appear in the five books of Moses.  As an example; why is the story of the creation of earth told twice?  This author is at the forefront of biblical(old testament) scholarship by showing that in fact the five books of Moses are most likely a series of different books combined and then redacted into one form.  There is the Books of J and E and then there are additions and some commentary in a book of D(Deuteronomy) and a further layover of the Redactor who brought these varied books together.<br />The argument here is relatively simple, if far fetched for those not familiar with it, namely that two bibles existed in ancient Israel Books J and E.  These most likely were due to the civil war between the two Jewish states(Southern and Northern).  The author presents his case clearly, if briefly, and explains that  these two books were combined to form the beginning of the modern day Torah.  Yet the chapter of Leviticus was later edited to be made mostly a legal diatribe on the Rabbinical Priesthood, while Deuteronomy was edited to be put in line with Samuel and the god/Israel relationship.  A redactor was able to combine these varied plots and lobby's to create the text we know to be the Torah and the one that we know to be correct, one that has existed for three thousand years(plus or minus a few hundred).  No other religious book comes close to the Torah in its exactness, for instance the New testament is retranslated and seemingly changed every few decades.  Rest assured this book is a revolutionary look at the origins of monotheism but a quick flip through and you will see this is a must have as a companion to any biblical research.  A must have and a joy to read this will open your eyes to biblical scholarship and shed light on the imprint man has given the interpretation of God.

Many books document the environmental catastrophes of Russia, the business climate, the `Oligarchs' and the war in Chechnya but there is a dearth of knowledge surrounding U.S-Russia relations.  Building on the `Lenin's Tomb' and \\"Resurrection' as well as `The Oligarchs' this book explains the quixotic nature of U.S policy.  From George Bush's support of Yeltsin to Clintons aiding of the youthful Russian economy to George W. Bush's  \\"I Saw his soul\\" speech in regards to Putin.<br />A whirlwind account documenting many of the American efforts vis-&agrave;-vis the former Soviet States this book is essential reading for those interested in the current Georgian crises and the fate of Mr. Shevrednadze.  Also included here are insights into the Chechan conflict, the Kursk, Putin's nationalism, Zhironovsky's fascism, Yeltsin's infirmity and the fledgling `cowboy' capitalism of Russia's oligarchs and mafia.

With separate maps of most Italian towns and easy to read legends showing the locations of train stations, bus stops and cheaper-then-average hotels/hostels you will have no problem navigating the otherwise precipitous Italian landscape. The focus of most 'Lets Go' books is the lower end hotels so if you're looking for four star elegance you may be slightly dismayed. Nevertheless this volume has excellent introductions to Italian history, culture, food and geography. Separate sections detail concerns for women and the gay/lesbian traveler.<br />A very helpful guide to Italy, this is slightly superior to the similar 'lonely planet' travel guide. Its sections on Venice, Naples and Palermo are essential to navigating those harder then average cities.

The book bills itself as showing the secrets of the CIA involvement in bring Mr. Pinochet to power and it contains the documents to prove it.  One quote describing the book says `The smoking Guns are all here' apparently indicating that America was directly responsible for every heinous act of Mr. Pinochet.  A debatable thesis at best, this book does clearly link the CIA to Pinochet coup, but it must not be forgotten that the weapons and men who followed Pinochet to power were the responsible parties.  The reality is that Mr. Reagan later ensured that Pinochet would leave power, so if `evil' America brought him to power then at least `evil' America got rid of him.  An excellent book that is very interesting and exposes the excesses and brutal nature of the Pinochet regime. Few books are as thorough in documenting the American involvement, political science majors will be pleased.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2003-12-08

Although The Israelis were told to not be `the first nation to employ nuclear weapons in the middle east' Mr. Eban replied to Mr. Rusk saying `We wont be the second either'.  Thus this book describes the complicated political game that was the 1960s relationship with Israel in which America looked the other way at the Dimona project while JFK declared he would support `any friend'.  Nasser helped cement the relationship by excepting Czech arms.  Thus this books shows the truth behind Americas ties to Israel wasn't `Jewish influence' but rather cold war politics.

Although shallow on some details and not current enough in terms of looking at contemporary populations this survey of Gypsy history is an important account.  Although the author does not fully explain the origins of the Romani and he does connect the importance of the `wandering Jew' stereotype to the gypsy phenomenon this book does give a complete account of relations with and among the Gypsies from their original immigration to Europe to the present.  Gypsy's are present in every major European country, and in some eastern European countries they makes up a large percentage of the population.  Poor and wretched the Gypsies are phenomenally misunderstood and understudied, unlike the Jewish Diaspora which is well documented due to Jewish literary traditions and academic heritage the Gypsy's are a people lost to words and a people that deserve books like this one chronicling their ways and customs and plights.  One factual error may  be present in this book, in an early chapter the author assumes the description `Egyptians' applies to Gypsy's, the authors conjecture is most likely incorrect as `Egyptian' probably meant `Arab' or North African muslim.  A minor error that should not detract from the book as a whole.	2003-12-08

Although the account is biased and highly subjective it lends itself to a very interesting read, one that any scholar of Australia or the far east and especially anyone interested in Indian-white relations will enjoy.  The book details the original encounters with the natives as well as contemporary native issues, such as the 1988 bicentennial of the founding in which a massive wave of Aboriginal protest swept the nation to draw attention to the plight.  Of course parallels with American Indians are everywhere.  A very interesting book, although `Fatal Shore' is probably a superior and less anti-European account.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2003-12-08

Fleming has done it again.  Following success with `Barrows Boys' and `Killing Dragons' Fleming has written the epic compilation of the quest for the North Pole.  Although `Arctic Grail did a good job on this subject it had one mighty failing, it concluded with Peary's march to the Pole.  Mr. Fleming uses new evidence to show that Pearys and Cooks march to the pole were both illusions and probably outright frauds.  Simple analysis of their log books makes this clear.  Fleming goes on to write about the many airborne attempts at the pole and the actual successful walking attempt in 1968.  Simply the most up to date and wonderful book on the Pole attempts, it covers everything from Franklins doomed expedition for the passage to the Jeannete, Nansans Farthest North and Mr. Peary's illusion.

Nevertheless this volume has excellent introductions to Italian history, culture, food and geography.  Separate sections detail concerns for women and the gay/lesbian traveler.<br />A very helpful guide to Italy, this is slightly superior to the similar `lonely planet' travel guide.  Its sections on Venice, Naples and Palermo are essential to navigating those harder then average cities. The 2003 edition may be slightly inferior to the 2002 edition if you can pick up the older one(not much has changed in Italy so the traveler need not be concerned about hotel closing or the statue of David moving!)<br />Seth J Frantzman 2003	2003-12-03

George Bush's foreign policy has accurately been described as a `revolution' by these very insightful authors.  They take the president to task for the unilateralism while also giving him begrudging praise to turning on its head the way we have viewed international bodies and our `allies'.  The authors seem to criticize and congratulate at the same time, thus giving the book an air of unbiased reading that is often hard to find in books about the Bush administration.<br />Unfortunately the case is not closed.  We do not know the full extent or effects of Bushs policies yet.  All we can do is estimate.  The reality is that this insightful books will need an update in a few years and thus maybe it is better to wait until then to purchase it, Nevertheless for those interested in current events this will be a happy pick, especially for the unbiased open minded reader.  Bush's policy must be understood in order t o understand Americas new role in the world, as an empire and a hegemon.	2003-12-02

It combines the authors vast knowledge of many subjects with the inability to get to the point.  The book was intended to be about the great volcanic eruption of Krakatoa, which destroyed the island and caused havoc.  A fascinating story indeed.  But this book rambles from subject to subject.  From the history of spices to navigation to geology and finally, two thirds of the way through the book the actual event is described, but by this time many readers will be bored to death.  This is a wonderful book and the prose is beyond comparison, but it does include a variety of subject,  someone with an eclectic mind will enjoy this fine account but if you are only interested in the event this may not be the best book.	2003-12-02

Although some choices were provided it seemed that the book passed over many fine dining establishments.

886392:US	51065232	R23M3D484Q9CNP	0471404209	746286426	Ice Blink: The Tragic Fate of Sir John Franklin's Lost Polar Expedition	Books	4	8	8	N	N	A good read, slightly speculative	The Fate of the Franklin expedition will most likely always be a mystery.  This wonderful, speculative account is one of the best.  The author does a step by step look at all the factors and issues leading to the disaster that cost the lives on 129 British Navy personnel in search of the Northwest passage.  Franklin had left England in 1845 with two of the best equipped ships ever put to sea for arctic exploration, he had experienced officers and a compliment of 129 men.  They were never seen again.  Subsequently 50 expeditions searched and found only scraps of clues as to their disappearance.<br />This book claims the culprit was most likely Botulism in the canned meat.  This speculation runs contradictory to that lead poisoning thesis put forward in `Frozen in Time' and the fact that admiralty investigations proved the meat tins were not thoroughly sealed(thus Botulism couldn't have formed).  Nevertheless this is one of the best books on the fate of the expedition.  The author describes the final `death march' south along King William Island and the subsequent cannibalism that took place.  Excellent diagrams bring the ships to life and maps show the final route of Franklins last survivors.  A must read for those interested in arctic survival and the riddle of Sir John Franklin.<br />Seth J Frantzman November 2003	2003-11-26

The author builds and rehashed Gibbons original thesis and tries to paint a picture of how the church, beginning in the 6th century, tried to suppress free thought and debate.  While the church certainly did crush those it didn't agree with the books basic thesis is deeply flawed.<br />It was the Romans that crushed Greek thought by defeating them.  Rome was an exuberant, lascivious culture but not one that had deep philosophical debate.  This the western ideals of the Greeks and the obsession with reason was swept under the carpet long before the coming of the Universal Church.  The author argues that the church suppressed the western mind.  But it was the church that condoned sending the voyages that discovered the `new world' and it was the church that built its own observatory and it was Saint Thomas Aquinas who wrote the book on rationalizing the existence of god.<br />While this argument is pertinent the book contains many problems.  The reality is, of course, that western interests with scientific study and philosophy survived during the dark ages and saw a massive come back in the Renaissance, which took place right under the noses of the Popes in Rome.  If the church was so backward the Renaissance would not have been as vibrant as it was, seeing as how the church was based in Italy, the center of the renaissance.	2003-11-24

Hayes, Samuel Tilden, and the Stolen Election of 1876	Books	4	12	13	N	N	A singular account	This is a wonderful account of a forgotten crises, the election of 1876.  This was the election that created the `Southern Block' of unrepentant deep south governors and ended reconstruction, thus handing power back to the same people who had stood strong in the face of Lincoln in 1859.  An amazing story of American politics as it was in the late 1800s.  The machinations, the political machines, the `smoke filled rooms' and the `gray beards' who were king makers.<br />This is a riveting, if sometimes disorganized, story of the `stolen election' in which competing delegations from southern states created a crises that in some ways shows the weakness and towering strength of American democracy.  The subsequent election of 1880, covered expertly in `Dark Horse' which serves as a good companion to this book, was also tumultuous.  A wonderful read the opens up the whole theatre that was Americana in the 1870s.  The personalities of Grant and others are exposed in this book as well.	2003-11-24

A great companion to `Stalin's Generals' by Shukman(editor), this book tells the stories of every rank of Germanys command in WW II.  Separate sections detail the `Anti-Nazi Generals', the `Desk Generals' the Fieldmarshalls the `Battlefront' commanders and the `innovators'.  Every German general and military leader is mentioned.  From Guderian, the man who created `Blitzkrieg' to Rommell the `Desert Fox to Paulus who surrendered Stalingrad as well as luminaries like Rundstedt and Kesselring.<br />These wonderful biographical sketches help one understand the diversity in command of Hitler's war machine.  The generals ranged from the totally incompetent to dire hard Nazi's to professional soldiers like Rommell.  A number of the Generals were captured or killed before the war ended and many were tried for war crimes.  A wonderful book, very well written and one that allows you to jump from place to place since each sketch is authored by a separate expert.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2003-11-24

Most have forgotten that Garfield, Hayes, Harrison and Mckinley were civil war leaders and most were generals for the North who were brave and dashing in their youth.  Garfield, Hayes and Harrison have been swept into the ?dustbin of history? of late but this book revives them and tells the tale of their lives during the great cataclysm, the civil war.  When it comes to Grant not much is new here, and one would be better to pick up an individual biography of Ulysses.  The rest of the book is superb and one of a kind.<br />The author does a wonderful job in the brief biographical sketches of these future presidents and the book does an excellent job painting the picture of battle during the civil war, and the effect that singular heroism can have on events.  A wonderful study.  Any civil war buff will enjoy this account as will anyone with an interest in post civil war politics and American history.  This book makes an excellent gift and a fabulous read.  Not to be missed!!!	2003-11-24

Garfield	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A wonderful, one of a kind read	This is an amazing book, and a must have for anyone interested in post civil war America.  The `Stolen election' of 1876, so well covered in `Fraud of the Century' helped set the stage for the Garfield contest in 1880.  Garfield was a former civil war hero who was put onto the nomination floor at the last minute as a compromise between warring republican political factions.  His Vice-President, Arthur, was foisted upon the ticket as another compromise.  Garfield held great promise until he was gunned down by a lone gunmen, someone whose political fantasies mirroed the machine politics of the day.<br />A wonderful account, very well written, lucid and easy to read, a colorful account that evokes the times and tells the inside story of `smoke-filled room' politics.  A very American book that tells tales about our country and its Democratic nature.<br />Seth J. Frantzman	2003-11-24
892288:US	51065232	R1OAAGMJUK6KE8	0963624202	833171542	From Time Immemorial: The Origins of the Arab-Jewish Conflict over Palestine	Books	5	50	89	N	N	The Classic Work	The classic work on The Jewish Settlement of Palestine.  This is the classic book that explodes the myths surrounding the establishment of a Jewish State in Israel.  Peters originally intended to write a book describing the plight of the Palestinian refugees.  Her main questions were \\"Where did the refugees come from?\\" ,  \\"What is the Palestinian claim to the land of Israel?\\"  \\"how can the refugee problem be solved?\\".  This book seeks to tackle these questions by examining life in the holy land prior to 1948. Peters looks at a massive amount of data to draw her conclusions and make her solid arguments.<br />Central to the first portion of the book is the issue of Dhimmitude as it applied to Jews living in Palestine and the Arab countries prior to the British occupation in 1917.  She shows the great hardships and discriminations and pogroms the Jewish minorities suffered in Palestine as well as throughout the middle east.  Peters shows how the Jews never left Palestine and how a Jewish presence was maintained in cities like Hebron and Jerusalem from the time of Rome to 1948.<br />The second portion of the book investigates the claims of `numbers' and `facts' that have permeated the `who is the rightful owner debate'.  Peters looks at the immigration data and shows how the British worked hard to suppress Jewish immigration while turning a blind eye to Palestinian immigrants.  She further shows how absentee Arab landlords sold land to the Jewish settlers at very steep prices and that it was actually Arabs stabbing each other in the back that allowed for Jewish settlement and land purchasing.<br />Peters examines the refugee issues and shows how the Palestinians were treated vastly worse in Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt then they were by the Israelis. She shows how Arab rhetoric never translated into aid on the ground for the many thousands of Palestinians who fled following the failure of their invasion of Israel in 1948.  Peters goes on to show the best solution to the current problem would be a simple realization that an equal number of Jews were forcefully thrown out of the Arab countries in 1948 as the number of Palestinians who fled Israel.  500,000 Jews were forced to flee Yemen, Iraq, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Iran and other Arab countries following the 1948 war and those Arab countries confiscated all the possessions of these Jews who were forced by the same Arab governments to leave.  The Arab governments should have simply turned those possessions over to the Palestinians who had fled Israel, thus solving the refugee problem many years ago.<br />This is a classic work, although criticized by many if you read it you will see the facts are clear and the thesis is sound.current problem would be a simple realization that an equal number of Jews were forcefully thrown out of the Arab countries in 1948 as the number of Palestinians who fled Israel.  500,000 Jews were forced to flee Yemen, Iraq, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Iran and other Arab countries following the 1948 war and those Arab countries confiscated all the possessions of these Jews who were forced by the same Arab governments to leave.

This book tells the tale of the `siege' of the Christian church in Bethlehem in the spring of 2002.  During this period a Palestinian death squad occupied the sacred church and used it as a bunker to hide from the Israeli army.  The event was very controversial with some angry that Israel would dare to surround a church and some angry that Palestinians would dare to invade a Christian site.  The siege lasted more then 30 days and ended peacefully with Arafat `promising' to put the militants in prison.<br />The problem with this account is that it is rabidly pro-Palestinian.  Can you imagine if Jewish settlers had entered a Mosque and taken it over?  Well the world outcry and protests from amnesty international and the U.N would be never ending.  But basically the author argues that it was the vicious Israelis who were at fault because they dared to try to apprehend palistinian terrorists who were avowed members of a death squad.  The author looks at the situation through the eyes of those who were involved in the action; a shopkeeper, a palistinian, and an Israeli.  Unfortunately he choose an Israeli who was a typical revisionist, one claiming he didn't want to be in the west bank.  This is a biased account, full of anti-Israeli tirades and will not be good reading if you support Israel or want a balanced account of the standoff.	2003-11-21

These epic war leaders of the 5th century AD are sure to interest you for their eccentricity that is reminiscent of Patton and Macarthur.<br />Most of the sources are Thucydides history of the war, one in which he participated and fought in on the Athenian side.  Nevertheless the book is unbiased and covers all the participants from Athens to Sparta to Syracuse to Corinth. This well written tome is sure to spark renewed interest in Greece and the Hellenistic age.  Wonderfully presented I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the classical age or high military drama.	2003-11-21

As has been noted this book seems to endorse and defend the Islamic slave trade as the author argues it was more `humane' then the western version while at the same time this book explores the roots of Islams obsession with Slavery.<br />What's clear from this book is that Islam invented the African slave trade and introduced it to the West.  The West had taken slaves in battle but had never penetrated Africa as slave traders for the purposes of money.  Islam send thousands of Arabs deep into the hearts of Africa to get as many slaves as possible. This book details how most of the slaves sought were female which would be used for the sexual recreation of Muslim men.  The African women that became pregnant were punished and the children were murdered.  The male African slaves were frequently used as soldiers or killed and thus there is relatively little African culture in the Arab countries that imported more then 11 million or more African slaves from 500AD onwards up to this day.<br />The author tries to argue that these slaves were more humanely treated because they were not used to work fields as the slaves in the West were.  But its not clear how its more humane to treat young African women as sexual slaves for mere enjoyment, only to murder them at age 25 then it is to keep slaves for most of their natural life working on a farm and procreating.  Few if any of Islams African slaves were allowed to mate with eachother and have offspring this is why little African culture is apparent in Islamic countries today throughout the former Ottoman empire.<br />This book is essential for the west to understand that Islam was a slave loving and slave holding culture, one that in many ways mirrored the western obsession with human trade.  It is an interesting book.  This is essential reading for understanding the dark side of Islamic societies and the obsession that Arabs had in the slave trade.  The slave trade exists to this day in the Sudan and Africa where Arab gangs raid villages, stealing women and children to be sold as slaves to rich Saudis for sexual pleasure and house work.  Not much has changed in 1500 years in Saudi Arabia, and this book is a good primer on the basis for slavery in Islamic society, a basis that the author claims comes from the Koran exhorting Muslims to treat slaves well but to import them vigorously.Sudan and Africa where Arab gangs raid villages, stealing women and children to be sold as slaves to rich Saudis for sexual pleasure and house work.

The book explains how Greek ideas about freedom and love of art helped create the Renaissance in the 1500s which influences our tolerance of the profane today.<br />This is an important work, although by no means the most interesting of the `hinges' series it is a very insightful and intelligent account.  The book mostly focuses on Athenian Greek life and the philosophers and ideas it produced.<br />An interesting book, a good companion to the other `Hinges' books that look at the Irish and the Jewish contributions to the Western way of life.	2003-11-21

This book, while interesting and entertaining, has several flaws.  Its largest flaw is the authors subconscious hatred of Catholicism and love of Islam.  The author tries to make the argument that `enlightened' Islam(the same people that were circumcising women and importing slaves from Africa) was actually far superior to the western states of the Catholic world.  And that learning was loved  in Spain where `Jews and Muslims' preserved the works of Plato and Aristotle.  The basic fallacy here is that this is simply incorrect.  The Muslim governors win Spain had no interest in learning, they only had interest in conquering lands for Allah and they did not support these efforts, by many Jews who were translating the documents.  The Islamic hysteria with persecuting `non believers' led them to destroy many Greek texts that seemed polytheistic.  It was the Jews of Spain, who would later give birth to Maimonadies, that preserved the works of Plato and Aristotle and transported these works along trade routes to Christendom, where they were eventually adopted at Oxford and Florence.  This is where the author does the story justice, in describing the men and schools of learning that worked to preserve essential western works from the intolerance of the Church.  The book should have been called `between Cross and Crescent:  how enlightened men preserved the essential works of western civilization'.  An interesting account but historically flawed.	2003-11-21

This is a wonderful book, and the writing is as beautiful as the cover.  In some ways the book seeks to redress the actions of the Bounty's crew in casting Captian Bligh and his men into the ocean, thus the book castigates the mutineers far more then most other works on the Bounty.  This wonderful book also tells the story of the ensuing trials and tribulations that beset all the key characters including Mr. Bligh and Mr. Christian.<br />Included you will find excellent maps detailing Bligh's extraordinary journey home, a journey that proved him one of the worlds great navigators.  Maps also show the subsequent search for the bounty and the mutineers journey to Pitcairn island, where they quickly created a new society with the natives.<br />This is a must read for anyone interested in the South Seas, exploration or good drama, and would make a wonderful gift.  For another riveting tale of the sea read `Barrows Boys' by Fleming.	2003-11-21

It is lucid, quick whitted and lashes out with strong brush strokes, assaulting the nations of Europe and encouraging German minorities to rise to the occasion.  This book was the work of Hitler in the late 1930s when he had obtained power but prior to the beginning of World War Two.  The first chapters detail the authors interest in the German minorities and their rights throughout Europe.  The latter part of the book delves into the importance of America in Germanys coming conflict.<br />In the end this book is not much more enlightening then Mien Kampf in shedding light on the psychology of Hitler.  Although some new material is included mostly this will appeal to the German/Nazi enthusiast.  The writing becomes boring and you get the feeling you've read the same point again and again.	2003-11-21

These men, from various diverse backgrounds, served under a vicious tyrant and yet they were able to propel their nation to victory.  Obviously men like Zhukov figure prominently here.  He helped lead the defense of Leningrad, Stalingrad and was at the forefront of Operation Mars and the capture of Berlin.<br />These excellent character sketches apply to almost every high ranking Soviet general and some of the more obscure.  The commanders of the Air Force and Navy are included as are sketches of Stalin's key staff officers of `Stavka'.  Sketches are also made of the `might have been's'  the `ghosts' of Stalin's army which was the officer class Stalin eliminated in the 1930s.  These men were persecuted mostly because of their connection to the revolution and/or Trotsky.  These men, who Stalin brutally murdered, were the cream of the Soviet military and had been responsible for fashioning the Soviet army into a modern technological army and fighting not only the interventionists but also Poland.<br />This is must read for anyone concerned with World War Two, Stalin, or the Soviet Military system.  This is a wonderful book and biographical sketches like these are almost impossible for find elsewhere(with the exception of Zhukov who everyone is familiar with).  Of special interest are the portions written by Dmitri Volkogonov, whose legendary biographies of Stalin, Lenin and Trotsky have been eye opening best sellers in the USA and Russia.<br />---Seth J.

He had arrived just weeks late.  The mechanical `beasts' he had brought with him, tread driven sledges, have broken down.  Soon Scotts party is starving and unable to walk, and eventually they die, having reached the South Pole but not been able to return to their homeland.  This book chronicles the disaster of Scotts expedition, the success and dramatic failures it encountered.  The author then explores the hitherto unknown part of Scotts accomplishment: the aftermath.  Such interesting aspects are looked at as the memorial designs for Scott and the many memorials in London's Newspapers.  Also the author looks at the `imperialism' of Scotts enterprise and the way in which Scott and his `martyrdom' have been remembered.  An interesting book, with much to offer.	2003-11-16

Sir Francis Drake was a legend and his exploits are almost unbelievable.  He almost brought Spanish trade to a standstill in the New world.  He Sacked Cadiz and he helped defeat the Spanish armada of 1588.  And in 1577-80 he circumnavigate the globe, becoming only the second person to do so since Magellan.  Even more extraordinary he did so not for explorations purpose or to seek out trade, but mostly just for the hell of it.  Drake went around the world because he had already navigated the straits of Magellan and entered the pacific to raid Spanish trade around Chili and the Philippines.  By the time he was near the Philippines it was actually easier for Drake to go west rather then turn back.<br />The authors main argument and reason for writing this book is to investigate what Drake did for the many months that are unaccounted for in his voyage.  The Authors argument, based on some evidence, is that Drake discovered/mapped the Northwest, including the coasts of Vancouver, Oregon and Alaska.  Most of this information was omitted from official account, most likely because Queen Elizabeth wanted to establish a colony on the west coast of America to rival the Spanish Main.<br />The author explores much of Drakes life as well as covering the circumnavigation in depth.  This is an important work that investigates a Pirate turned accidental explorer who helped map a region of the world that wouldn't be acknowledged and re-mapped for almost a hundred year or more.  A wonderful account, very entertaining and easy to read.	2003-11-16

Most know the story of Magellan.  He set sail from Europe in the early 1500s, traveled to South America, where he discovered the passage the retains his name, to the pacific.  He traveled to Polynesia and mapped many islands.  With his men on the verge of starving he became the victim of mutiny and natives on a pacific island.  The surviving members of his once large, 5 ship, exploration party sailed for home via Africa.  Only 18 men of the original hundreds returned to Spain.  Their they told a story of savagery and hardship unparalleled in human travels(although later rivaled by the arctic explorers).<br />This is an interesting account of Magellan's adventure.  The downfall of this book is that it is flowery and full of flavor, almost as if the author was trying to view the world as those in 1500 viewed it.  But the flowery language takes away from the feelings of accuracy.  For instance one passage describes Magellan's men capturing `giants' in  southern Argentina.  The author provides no context of what these `giants' were, although he describes them as native men of south America.  Where they indeed `giants' that used to roam the earth in 1500?  Were they simply large men, larger then the short Spaniards?  This type of weakness and accepting of the crews descriptions is not authoritative.  The author should have explored what tribes lived in the southern tip of Argentina and told us of what height these people were when anthropologists later mapped the natives of South America.<br />Other then these subtle failures in writing style this book is good and it provides a much needed insight into life aboard Magellan's boats.  A very folksy colorful account.  A color insert is included with the book.	2003-11-15

This book finally fills the gap in scholarship surrounding Gaudi.<br />Gaudi was a Catalan from Barcelona.  He sculpted the famous La Sagrada Familia, Park Guell and a few other works including an apartment building.  He was a modernist and his buildings frequently appeared alive, as if from some fantastical dream, crawling, moving, fluid.  He was a genius, on par with Goya(who lived a century before and was a painter).  This is a wonderful account of the life and times of Guadi.  It explorers his passionate faith and his obsessive qualities.  It also looks at his unique designs and revolutionary ideas while exploring the cataclysms and social movements which shook Spain from 1900-1940.

She was born in rural India and given to an arrange marriage at the age of 11.  From that age she was raped repeatedly b y her husband, by the police and by members of a higher cast, the Thakurs.  By the time she was in her teens she had run away, having brought `dishonor' to her parents, and joined a group of bandits.<br />The film `Bandit Queen' portrays these circumstances in brutal detail.  This book is her story in her own words, as written by a well known French journalist.  This is a fabulous book, rich with detail and clear in its presentation of the life of a poor low caste(not class but caste) women in rural India, whose way of life has not changed for hundreds of years.<br />The event that brought world attention to Phoolan Devi was the massacre of dozens of men in a village.  Devi's bandits had rounded up the male villagers and in revenge for an earlier gang rape performed by these men on Devi she ordered them all shot down like the dogs they were.  Devi became a crusader, an avenging angel for the rural women of India.  In the end she gave herself up and was later elected to Parliament and assassinated.

Cook's first voyage explored the islands of the pacific.  His second voyage tried to find `the southern continent' Antarctica.  The third voyage explored the North pacific and ended with the death of Captain Cook at the hands of the natives of a pacific Island.<br />Cook was responsible for mapping much of the pacific ocean and its many islands.  His voyage was the first to sketch the giant stone sculptures of Easter Island(Rapa Nui).  He circled New Zealand, mapped parts of Australia, explored the Bering straight, kidnapped Polynesian Chiefs on islands like Tahiti and tried, in vain, to discover Antarctica(all he found was a sheet of ice but not land).  Cook was a giant in his own time.  He dealt with many powerful native tribes and his men catalogued the lives of these native peoples long before they were spoiled by colonization and western ways.  This book is full more then fifty sketches of the tribes he encountered and the items he saw.<br />This is simply a wonderful accurate and thoroughly researched account of Captain Cook and his voyages and contributions.

The arguments are varied but they all boil down to this:  The western media makes the middle east out to be undemocratic, barbaric, discriminatory towards women and full of fundamentalist terrorists.  Well lets look at the main points here.<br />Is the Middle east a center of democracy?  Well, no actually every country in the middle east, except Israel, is a dictatorship without freedom of speech, freedom of religion or freedom of he press.<br />Is the portrayal of the middle east being full of backward fundamentalists inaccurate?  Well in some instances yes.  Egypt and Iraq and Pakistan are slightly modern.  The rest of the middle east lives in the dark ages.  Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Oman, Yemen, Iran are all backward nations where little has changed since 532 AD(except now they have trucks and electricity).  All schools in the middle east teach the Koran as part of daily practice, there is not one secular state in the middle east, expect Israel(sort of).<br />Are women discriminated against in the middle east?  Well in Saudi women cant leave the house without permission and they cant drive either.  In Iran its illegal for women to visit beauty parlors or touch `unrelated' men.  In most middle eastern countries it is legal to beat and murder your wife for `honor' if she cheats.  Clearly women are 100% equal!<br />Does slavery exist in the middle east?  Yes, Arab traders routinely raid Sudanese villages to get slaves and sell them in Saudi.<br />While the rest of the world also has issues with human rights and women's rights and slavery and democracy the middle east seems to combine violations of all three. If anything the treatment of the middle east in the western press ignores the most extreme abuses of human rights found through the middle east.  In comparison the middle eastern press is virulently anti-western and anti-Jewish.  Maybe the authors of this book should look at bias on AL-Jezeera before they condemnwestern and anti-Jewish.

This was a massive fleet numbering more then ten thousand men.  It was larger then anything the Europeans would ever put to see to serve the sole purpose of discovery. The Chinese fleet was also an anomaly.  China was the `middle kingdom' and the Chinese knew they were the center of the universe.  So it was odd the prior to 1421 a large fleet was sent five times to discover new lands.  The Chinese did not try and conquer these lands, and they barely even tried to trade.  Thus it is a shame this book does not detail these voyages more.<br />Instead the author decided to write some revisionist history.  The author decided that `maybe' the Chinese Fleet, on its sixth and last voyage(one whose findings would later be burned and all record of discovery destroyed) `discovered' America.  Apparently they planted some corn and cavorted with the Indians.  The evidence?  Well none.  The author conjures up some interesting stories about a European who accompanied the voyage, and some other theories that support the theory that Cook and Magellan had `maps' that already depicted the new world.  Well lets not go crazy.  If Columbus knew where he was going then why was he scared that his crew would fall off the face of the earth?  There is some question about why Magellan thought he could go all the way around the earth, but just because Magellan had guts doesn't mean he was following Chinese maps.<br />The book is disjointed, the author speaks in the first person far to much and little evidence is used.  It is an interesting book and an interesting theory but unfortunately its just totally incorrect.	2003-11-13

It seems oddly inspiring and intellectual.  The authors approach is to look at a hitherto unnoticed subject, that of geographies impact on foreign policy, particularly the creation of an `American Empire'.  The authors opening paragraph explains his thesis.  In 1898 McKinley, informed of a Naval victory at Manila in the Philippines, exclaimed that for the life of him he could not find the islands on a map.  Thus McKinley was sending America into a colonial war without knowing where the territories were.  The author goes on to show how in 1984 Oliver North certainly knew where Iran and Nicaragua were when he arranged the complicated arms for hostages deal.  The implication is that America has been transformed into a nation very concerned with geography.<br />A man named Bowman is the culprit, according to the author.  Originally serving on the Machu Piccu expedition he went on to serve Wilson to help redraw borders throughout Europe, the middle east and Asia.  Then he went on to serve FDR and finally helped in 1945 to draw the new maps of Europe.  The implication:  That this man was a devout Cold Warrior and obsessed with American empire.<br />But the logic here is not only faulty, the books rambling ideas and coverage of academic shenanigans is simply to far fetched.  Someone had to redraw the map of Europe, does it really matter whether or not an American took part?  In 1945 someone had to draw a line down the center of Germany.  Throughout the 1950s and beyond the world was divided between communism and non-communism but this doesn't have any implications for geography, the world would have existed divided without any geographers, because it was ideas that divided the world.  Thus this book could have done more.  The author could have looked closely at the sailing of the Exploring Expedition of 1838 and the sailing of the Great White Fleet to understand the implications of American empire.  Instead the author relegated his account to an obscure subject that was not entirely relevant.

Arguably women in antarctica have as much interest and stories to share as men.  Unfortunatly this author, an unabashed feminist, just lists lots of boring facts and petty acheivements of women.

Typical of the rabbinical theories of Israeli statehood the author calls on the creation of a secular state based on the `original' intent of the founders like Ben-Gurion and Golda.  The problem is the author is selective in his choosing of statements by Gurion.  While Gurion did condemn the occupation of the West bank he did not believe the Israel should be forced to tolerate a terrorist state of Palestinians, instead Gurion proposed that Jordan occupy Palestine so as to keep the terrorists in check.<br />The author ignored the essentially Jewish non-secular nature of the founders of Israel.  From Hertzl who yearned for `Der Judenstat' to Ben Gurion who was happy to see rest on Sabbath(whether or not he actually `kindled a fire' on the holy day) to Golda Mier who declared `it is more objectionable for an orthodox soldier to eat from a non-kosher kitchen then for the secular Jew to eat Kosher food'.  The founders yearned for labor Zionism not secular Zionism.  Secularism means the separation of church and state to such a radical degree that no mention of religion can be made at the state or educational level.  This was not the intent of Ben-Gurion in creating an `all Jewish' Histadrut(labour organization) or when he created an all Jewish army or when he emphasized the creation of Jewish `facts on the ground'.  Gurion was obviously more obsessed with creating a homeland for ethnically Jewish people, but they still had to be Jewish, practicing or not.<br />Unfortunately a secular Israel(if by secular the author wants what we have here in the USA where no sense of religion is introduced in school) is not Israel.  Israel without a Jewish majority is not Israel, and without a Jewish majority and a Jewish army the Jews of Israel will be in worse Peril then the Jews of Europe in 1939.  This is a fact that the author does not seem to grasp in his argument for the creation of  a terrorist state in the west bank.to grasp in his argument for the creation of  a terrorist state in the west bank.	2003-11-12

This excellent, lengthy, biography deals with FDR in all his greatness.  The authors main point is the FDR saved the world,  capitalism and America.  FDR made many firsts.  He was the first president in a wheel chair.  He was the most traveled president up to that time(Coolidge, president from 1924-1928 had never even left the United States).  FDR was deeply involved in building the atom bomb, which he wanted to use against Germany.  FDR?s Wife Eleanor was to become an icon for feminism and women?s rights as well as a champion of minorities.  FDR was the first president to serve four terms.  And he beat the depression and won a World War(although he didn?t live to see its conclusion).  This book more then does him justice.  It is important to learn of the internationalism of FDR in this time of terror.  FDR was the ultimate activist in foreign policy, pushing America relentlessly towards war.  He actively supported England, the special relationship, and ensured war with Japan due to an oil embargo.  Although accused of looking the other way to warnings of pearl harbor, FDR was quick to arrange a token revenge mission, ordering Doolittle to bomb Tokyo and ditch his planes in China.<br />This book rightly claims that FDR, next to Lincoln, was the great savior of the nation.  The title evokes the ?Four Freedoms? of Rockwell;  freedom from hunger, freedom from fear, freedom of speech and freedom of religion.  An excellent account and a necessary update on this greatest of American presidents.	2003-11-12

Many find interesting the sharp divide in Israel between secular and orthodox.  Yet what many don't realize is the current manifestation of Judaism and Jewish debate only mirrors what took place in the time of King David when Ancient Israel was a Jewish state.  The leaders of ancient Israel and the Jewish people of ancient Israel were bitterly divided between those that were overly observant and those that were marginally observant.  The Bible tells stories of  these people and their debates.  This book details the epic and naturally Jewish debate over religion and observance.  Between the ultra orthodox, to the orthodox who reject statehood to the religious Jews, the messianic Jews,  the Ashkenazi and Sephardic and even the radical secularists of Shinui, and the labour Zionists.  Israel is an extraordinary country because of its vast diversity in opinion.  Never has the world seen such a `stiff necked' people who posses so many diverse and amazing qualities of debate.  There is no correlation in Jordan or Saudi of the diverse religious opinions one sees in Israel.  This book does a good job of presenting the current religious debates one finds in the Jewish state.  An interesting account.	2003-11-12

This author wanted to understand what would make a women commit such an act.  The author uses thee stories of five women who became suicide bombers to illustrate the reasons behind female suicide bomb and suicide bombing in general.<br />What drives someone to martyrdom is one of the essential questions.  The second question the author examines is what drives women, who are oppressed and promised little for their deeds, to become suicide bombers.  Religious Imams have promised Muslim men who become suicide bombers that they will receive 30 to 100 virgins in heaven for their deeds.  Well Palestinian women aren't promised 100 virgin men(one doubts they would want 100 virgin men) and there is little religious reward for their suicide.  So what drives them?  The author draws the conclusion that it is a myriad of small issues and events that drive the women to death. The author contends the main reason is the poverty and hopelessness these women feel about their lives.  This excellent book also shows definitely that these young women are `recruited' and almost brainwashed into these horrendous acts.  Many of the women are groomed from youth to hate and live for suicide.  It is a terrible commentary and the author is critical of the Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Al Aqsa leaders who use the youth of Palestine as suicide bombers when many of these leaders live comfortable lives, sending young women to their deaths.<br />The author also explores the women who have tried and failed to commit suicide.  She shows the sad and awful lives the women are faced with.  Pressed into killing themselves by men who aren't willing to die they are then sent to prison and their houses sometimes demolished.  A frightening account of what drives people to commit terrible acts, an inside view of the Palestinian crises and the creation of a culture of martyrdom as the only goal in life.  An important book to add to any understanding of the Palestinian resistance movement, this book unmasks the heroic picture usually used to portray Palestinian `freedom fighters' and shows the brutal honest truth.e.

Wrong as is made plainly clear in this extraordinary story of struggle and survival.  This is the story of the Sudan where for the last 1500 years Arab slave traders have been enslaving Christian and animist Africans.  In modern times no effort has been made by anyone including the west or the U.N to outlaw slavery and slave trading in the Sudan.  Other African countries are no longer plagued by European and Arab slavers but the Sudan is still beset by this evil.<br />The author was born in the Sudan where slave traders raided his village, murdered the men and enslaved the women and children.  The Women were used to sexual recreation for rich Arabs while the boys were used for simple housework.  The author explains the terrifying events he experienced and his struggle to try and escape his sadistic masters.  The author finally managed to escape and immigrate to the United States where he has worked to expose the world to the trauma of ongoing slavery in Africa.  He exposes with brilliant language, reminiscent of Fredrick Douglas, the horrors of slavery.<br />This is an important book.  Few know anything about Africa and even less is known about the continuing aspects of Arab slave trading which are brought to light in this important and seminal work.  A wonderful piece of literature about an obscure subject, an easily readable account, a necessary addition to any library.	2003-11-11

The author takes the reader on a walk through the many faces and issues surrounding Eminems meteoric rise too fame.  The book discusses his childhood and his seemingly rise out of no where.  It describes the unlikely rap star and why people love him and hate him.<br />Probably the largest problem with the book is the authors personal injections of race and his personal opinions into the book.  Rather then admiring Eminem for succeeding in a field where everything was against him and admiring Eminem from getting ahead in a society that does not cater to the poor trailer trash white male, the author bashes Eminem for his skin color saying \\"whereas Woods(tiger), Williams(Serena and Venus) represent rebel victory Eminem represents a reversal of race roles...toppling of black men when too many black men are imprisoned\\".  This diatribe and a few other statements like it have nothing to do with Eminem.  He was promoted by a black man Dr Dre and is loved by all the races.  His ideas on the multiculturalism of rap and the extending of hip hop culture to all races are essential messages in this age of racial hatred and the author should have stayed well away from his own personal theories.  Eminem didn't topple any black men, Eminem simply pulled himself up by his own boot straps, succeeding where almost no one else has before and using musical talent that no one can even try and imitate.  An amazing story of a true American rebel and the world he created.	2003-11-11

Beginning with the founding of the party and the election of Lincoln this book takes us through many of the essential victories and defeats of the Republican party.  It looks at the Johnson impeachment crises.  The scandals of Grant.  The `stolen election' of  1876.  The rise of Teddy Roosevelt and Taft.  This book does a wonderful job at looking at the era of republican dominance(1920-1933).  The author brilliantly looks at the essential problems and changes facing the GOP.  The transformation of the party from one of federalism under Lincoln to one of anti-government under Reagan.  He shows how the Republican party worked hard to find the soul of the nation and preserved all that was essentially American.

This new tome stays with his typical argument that everything American is bad and American power is the worst thing the world has ever seen.  Mr. Chomsky, ignoring American democracy and women's rights and our essential freedoms, takes America to task for being a `Hegemon'.  Using falsely long words touched with Hubris and tainted by a plethora of superlatives he lays into the `American Empire' mentality declaring that he is `challenging the reigning ideological system'.  Apparently this ideological system is western civilization and to Chomsky things like allowing women to vote and having free speech and democracy mean nothing, if anything they are an evil appendage that he would like to dismantle in order to build a `new society' of love and peace.<br />This book and its arguments are as outlandish and off base and unrealistic as most of his volumes.  Like `blowback' and `towards a new cold war' he believes that by simply arguing that America is evil he can sell copies.  Yet his arguments are rehashed and mostly illogical.  For instance he wants us to believe that America is the greatest terrorist nation on earth and that we are the greatest sponsor of human rights violations.  Well at least in America women can leave the house without permission from a man, unlike Saudi, and at lease in America we get to vote every four years, unlike China.  This book is so full of lies and false claims and weak arguments that its almost to difficult to try and explain what exactly the new argument here is.  Mostly this new volume is a waste of time as it mirrors previously published Chomsky diatribes.	2003-11-11

For more then a generation the black flag of POW/MIS has flown over many a house and VFW post in America.  Many hundreds if not thousands of men went missing in Vietnam and never returned.  It is believed that many were never released from POW camps in Cambodia and Laos.  This book chronicles the investigation and sightings of Americans POWs who were left behind.  Like rumors of the holocaust, rumors of POW sightings in Laos have been commonplace but many investigations have turned up little.<br />This is a wonderful book.  It goes into great detail surrounding the mystery of the lost men of Vietnam.  An essential read, interesting, informative and tragic.  It reminds us why we must never leave a man behind.  Anyone interested in the military, Vietnam, east Asia, or in need of good winter reading will enjoy this book.  It would make a great gift as well for an avid military buff.	2003-11-11

The sad part here is not that his points are well made or that his essays are not good writing, the tragedy is he should have written a book and combined the ideas from his essays to form chapter outlines.  As a collection this is a weak read where much fat is included with the meat.

Badly presented material which otherwise is interesting, not the correct format.	2003-11-11

John Ross, who had earlier failed to find the Northwest passage and had created a mirage of `Lancaster sound' in 1818 returned in 1828 to lead an expedition by steam to seek out the Northwest passage and map the arctic.  He ended up stranded for almost four years.  His men survived on meager rations while learning from the natives.  A small party led by his Nephew James Ross also discovered the Magnetic North Pole.<br />This is an amazing account of the ordeal of this harrowing journey into the arctic wasteland.  Well written, its greatest downfall is that it includes only one map.  This book will be enjoyed by anyone interested in the arctic, seafaring, adventure or survival stories.

When the senior crew members sailed to Java for help Corneliszoon, a crewmember took charge and soon set off on a wave of murder and slaughter so terrible the island was renamed 'Batavia's Graveyard'.  A harrowing account of savagery, evocative of Lord of the Flies.

This book brings to life men like Bolivar, San Martin,  and Miranda.  Wonderful chapters details the rebellions from the first stirrings in 1780 to the final victories in 1850.  It details the liberation of Brazil, and the rest of Spanish America.  A good deal of information is provided on the English involvement, their diplomatic missions and their precipitation of war in Argentina.<br />The books downfalls are mostly editing mistakes and a few misspellings along with the occasion flaw in dating.  In many ways one wishes the book could expand to include the early life of the new republics.  It would be interesting if the author could have covered the `ten years war' between Argentina and Uruguay and the Three nation war where Uruguay, Argentine and Brazil allied to almost annihilate Paraguay.  But alas these subjects are beyond the authors framework.<br />The book is not biased and doesn't dather into the obscurity of socialist theory and other revisionist obsessions that many people have for Latin America.  What is not fully explained is why the Latin American choose to fight for independence.  There is much history on the American revolution and the decision to oppose the British but there is little analysis of what drove these men to declare war on a vastly superior European power(albeit one that was in decline).

On the one hand it is the first and only(to my knowledge) account of the Hugo Chavez debacle in Venezuela.  This volume documents the rise of Chavez.  The failed coup, the army, the prison term and his present role as dictator-in-making of Venezuela.  This is a fine account of  the life of this controversial leader who embodies the 1970s communist idealism with the standard Latin American coup mentality and obsession with military strongmen.  He is a caudillo in every sense of the word, except he is living in modern times when Caudilloism is no longer appreciated because it subverts democracy.<br />This book highlights the present problems in Venezuela.  The major flaw here is the authors opinion that Chavez is a romantic communist who is reforming his country.  Well this is just not true.  Average Bolivians, especially the urban unions hate Mr. Chavez and the oil workers walked off the job to protest his treatment of them.  Mr. Chavez is a typical leftist who has used divisive politics to `help' indigenous rural Indians and divide the country along race and wealth lines.  In this he has failed, which is why the country came to an economic standstill last year.  Chavez suspended the rule of law, arrested his political opponents and pounded his chest in daily 4 hour TV broadcasts.  He is a disgusting gutter like gangster and the author doesn't look at this side of him at all.  The author in point of fact was a writer on the guerrilla movements of the 60s in Latin America and has apparently been taken under the Chavez spell, because Chavez once met Castro, who is the authors hero.  The book is terribly biased and does not tell the whole truth, namely that ordinary proletariat factory workers in Venezuela hate Chavez and his programs.  He has systematically crushed the unions in his attempt at dictatorship.	2003-11-07

When the French began to penetrate the Sahara in the 1830s they had no idea how much of a wasteland it was.  The Sahara in fact is so big it could swallow the United States whole.  In the last 19th century explorers and military adventurers began to venture into the vast  wasteland, usually the expeditions originated from the south.<br />Charles de Foucauld and Henri Laperrine star as the main characters in this historical account of colonialism and adventure.  One is a wandering womanizer turned saint, a fanatic whose insane ideas knew no bounds.  The other is a strict military officer.  The only characteristic the two men had in common was  devotion and strict discipline.  They became fast friends as the fanatic led the soldier across the desert in search of empire and national redemption.  The author details in great photographic text the many stories and adventures these two men had, one of which included the creation of a camel corps to explore the desert wasteland where no man could survive.<br />This book is perfect for anyone interested in survival/adventure stories, anyone interested in the Sahara and life in the desert as well as colonial enthusiasts.  This is not an overview of the French colonial experience in Algeria, although many of the subjects, like the rise of Muslim fundamentalism are touched upon, this book looks at the French colonial experience through the eyes of two very eccentric if  typically French individuals.  An important book on an oft not covered subject.	2003-11-07

912087:US	51065232	R3V6QHM3ERY09W	1401300561	890884070	Never Give In!: The Best of Winston Churchill's Speeches	Books	3	94	105	N	N	Good but not great	Originally this book seemed to have high hopes.  Churchill was simply the best, most eloquent moving speaker of the 20ths century.  Anyone who has listened to his speeches on tape will agree that his metered tone, angry growl and twisting of words like Nazi into 'Nazziiii' will move you to tears and to want to follow him.  This book is a compilation of his `greatest speeches'.  Unfortunately the volume does not emphasize his BEST speeches, namely the ones he made from 1938-1941.  The author, his grandson, should have spent more time introducing the really famous speeches and spent less time and space on the more marginal speeches which took place in 1942-44.<br />Churchill has always been remembered for three things; Warning Britain of impending war in the 30s, rallying the country when all seemed lost in 1940 and finally for warning the world of communism in the `iron curtain' speech.  Although these important speeches are in this book its not easy to find them and they are jumbled in with speeches that are easily forgettable.<br />Its almost impossible to locate the `Never give in, never surrender' speech for which the book is named.  Its even harder to locate the `fight on the beaches, fight in the hills' speech. Not quite as hard to find is the `finest hour' speech.  Also hard to locate though is the `if a large part of our island should be occupied we shall retreat to our empire and our navy' portion of his famous 1940 speech.  This essential line occurs in the end of a speech that is not introduced as being important, and yet this line was important in seeing Churchill's unending hatred and indomitable will to defeat Hitler, no matter the cost, a personality trait which probably saved western civilization from the Huns.<br />An important book, a great reference and a good gift.  Its downfall is that the author didn't want to add much commentary. He must have figured readers would find the important speeches and statements themselves.  But to someone who enjoys Churchill but is not familiar with when exactly his famous speeches  occurred it will be hard to find his best one liners.Churchill but is not familiar with when exactly his famous speeches  occurred it will be hard to find his best one liners.	2003-11-05

The Bronfmans, Diller, Murdoch, Redstone, Turner, Levin, Redstone, Eisner and others.  Although very well written the book smacks of arrogance.  Just who is Mr. Wolff?  He is a nobody who happened to wriggle his way into a conference under the cover of interviewing Murdoch and spends the time pretending to hob nob with the largest media `moguls' of our time.  Wolf seems to think these men are mere mice in his vegetable garden.  If only Mr. Wolf could be given the reigns he could do ten times what mere mortals like Diller have done.  He criticizes each man and breaks these `Moguls' down to size.  In doing so he does help to explode some myths.<br />His analysis of Bronfman is insightful, Mr. Bronfman has mismanaged his empire, but at least he dared to take his family out of the stodgy booze business.  He says of Diller that his success has been `luck'.  Well if its all been luck then why hasn't he gotten unlucky, instead Mr. Diller has climbed higher and higher year after year.  The author aims his guns at Roger Ailes of Fox news saying he is `creepy'.  Well maybe he is creepy but he has turned Fox News into a very powerful news network and created a number of media stars like Bill O'Reilly.<br />This book is a scathing account, its intellectualism is a thinly veiled attempt of someone who is deeply jealous of the power these `moguls' have.  Mr. Wolff may be a good writer but that's no excuse to basically say everyone who has been successful in media is either a moron, a cheat or just plain lucky.  Apparently even Mr. Bloomberg is a fool according the standards set forth by the author.  The book is merely a simple way of the author telling us he is unhappy he hasn't accomplished more in his life.<br />This book had great potential as a close and inside look at the men who forged media empires and use them to bend the way we think.  Yet it falls far short in its endless ranting and small minded attacks on people that are all to easy to attack.  Lastly the authors conclusion that the media business is about to collapse is his most off base and irrational comment.  A total fallacy!le that are all to easy to attack.

He made three fatal errors.  He ordered his troops to rip the veils off women in order to force modernity upon the radical Muslims of Iran.  He dealt with Israel with brought him the hatred of the Mullahs.  Lastly he tried to emphasize a pre-Islamic past, a Persia where the capital was Persepolis.  This went against the Islamic nature of erasing anything historical that comes before Islam.  Thus the Shah drew the ire of the radical Muslims of Iran and he was ousted from power.<br />This book details his ideas and his efforts. He speaks openly about his anti-communism(the only thing he shared with the Mullahs) and about his military build up, trying to make Iran a world power.  He speaks about his ideas of combining moderate Islam with a secular government.  He speaks about the influence that Ataturk and Nasser had on him.  He speaks about how he gave woment he right to vote and did not have a polygamous marriage.<br />This is an interesting book.  Obviously it tells the Shahs story from his point of view, but his point of view is something we are to often deprived of in the West.  In our time the Shah has been vilified as a ruthless leader who used American money to suppress his people.  The reality, as he articulates, is that the radical Muslims created a far worse dictatorship where secret trials, execution and worse religious persecution were rampant.  Iran might not have been perfect under the Shah but at least women could go to school, at least women could shake the hand of an `unrelated man' and at least dancing and beauty parlors were'nt illegal.  An important book in light of the current opposition to Irans Muslim dictatorship.	2003-11-05

The Shah had dismantled everything the religious radicals held dear in Iran.  He had abolished `Islamic only' history and began speaking of a `pre-Islamic' state based on the historical Persia.  He ordered his army to rip the veils off women and then finally gave women the right to vote, something that Islamic radicals like the Ayatollah found anathema to their male dominated society.  Lastly the Shah became an ally of Israel.  In many ways the Shah wanted to emulate Ataturk but he didn't realize Ataturk succeeded because he was a nationalist.  This book details the total failure of the alternative to the Shahs rule.<br />The 1979 revolution has been called the `last great revolution' but in fact it was a total failure.  The Muslims who took power in 1979 promised a free democratic society based on traditional Islam.  But it wasn't long until `traditional' Islam began to infringe on the everyday rights of people.  Dancing was abolished.  Women were no longer allowed to shake the hands of `nonrelated' men.  Beauty parlors were closed and veils were forcefully applied to all women. The state became totalitarian and in effect the new regime became worse then the old for many average people.<br />The authors of this book went to Iran in the 90s and explored this phenomenon of a revolution gone wrong.  Although slightly dated this book shows the reality inside those that would proclaim Islamic states based on religious Shari'a law.  This book chronicles the failure of the high minded revolutionaries, in many ways similar to the failure of revolution in Russia.  In both Russia and Iran a revolution promised freedom for the average man but ended up shackling the average people more then before.<br />Today Iran is in the midst of returning to secular democracy.  In 1979 Iranian students hated America `The Great Satan' now they listen to broadcasts intently..  An interesting book, an important read.	2003-11-05

The author surmises what `might have been' if the Japanese had actually built the bomb before the Americans could drop one.  This conclusion has several serious flaws.<br />First the Japanese did not have the technical expertise that the Germans had at  their heavy Water plant in Norway.  The Japanese, even with the `secret' plans could not have built an atom bomb.<br />Second if the Japanese had been able to build an atom bomb they would have had no where to test it and therefore the bomb they would have created most likely would have never worked.<br />Third the Japanese had no delivery system to drop the bomb on L.A(as is concluded in the book).  Japan had short range bombers and no Japanese aircraft carriers were serviceable in 1944/45 when U-234 was sent on its mission.  The best the Japanese could have down with an atom bomb is drop it on the Philippines, maybe India, China and if they were lucky Australia.  By 1944 Japanese air capabilities consisted of kamikaze pilots, not sophisticated bombers.<br />So the logic in this book is all wrong although its an interesting story the author should have left off the conclusion.	2003-11-04

Ok so here is the book we have all been waiting for detailing the kidnapping and rescue of Elizabeth smart.  Except its not.<br />Here is the book by the parents who invited strange men into their house as handymen, virtually ensuring their daughter would be kidnapped and then they went on to write a book so they could make a pot full of money.  The book itself lacks information and is basically a big piece of propaganda about faith.  Faith is great but its one thing to have faith and its another to hire handymen with criminal backgrounds and let them hang out alone with your teenage daughters.  Did the bible command the smarts to allow strangers into their house???<br />A few other problems are presented by this book, beyond the mere profit taking of it all.  The Smarts don't clarify a number of inconsistencies in their story.  First, why did it take so long for them to give the police the name of the fellow who actually kidnapped the girl, he had worked for them but somehow they just forgot to mention him, fishy!  Second the book doesn't resolve how it is that magically after 9 months(the term of a pregnancy) the Smarts suddenly remembered this odd and terrifying character who they had knowingly let their daughter associate with.  Lastly the book doesn't explain how the daughter suffered from the so-called `Stockholm' syndrome.  This is totally ridiculous.  If the daughter, as we are told, was shown the posters asking for her return then she knew her parents wanted her back, so then why when she was at a party dressed in a burkha did she not cry out?  Totally fishy!  The burkha would have disguised a woman who was pregnant, oddly enough.<br />This book is a waste of time, it doesn't answer many of the questions about the Smart family and in the end reads like a wet tortoise, slow and not easy to get a handle on.	2003-11-04

No other study or similar volume compares to what Mr. Massie has done here.<br />This book follows on his excellent account of the build up to the Great War and the development of the dreadnought. His last book on this subject (Dreadnought: Britain Germany and the coming of the great war) detailed the great naval arms race that made war 'inevitable'. This book details the actual conflict.<br />The author argues that while the arms race made war inevitable the German high commands decision not to boldly use the navy condemned it to failure. The author tells many fascinating tales in his book. He has excellent character sketches of Churchill, Scheer and Tirpitz. He also looks at the amazing story of the 'Goeben' a German surface raider.<br />He looks at the advent of unrestricted submarine warfare. He also looks at the battles that did take place like the River Plate(Falklands) and Dogger Bank as well as the bombardment of British coastal cities by German ships.<br />The climax of the volume is the battle of Jutland. The author tells in stunning detail every action packed minute of this epic clash of steel on the high seas.<br />An amazing book, sure to be THE standard on the subject for years to come. Massie's prose is beyond comparison, he writes history to make you feel it, to give you an appetite for the wide range of subjects he touches upon. All WWI enthusiasts and naval buffs will love this book as will the common reader with an interest in history.	2003-11-03

Massie's second book on the British/German dreadnoughts is a winner!!!  The first volume named 'Deadnought: Britian Germany and the coming of the great war' was a masterpiece of history and a great span of history from the unification of Germany to the declaration of war.  The first book detailed the arms race between the two nations, specifically at sea.<br />This second volume covers a mere four years of bloody conflict, yet its a tour de force.  The Germans confronted the British in the North Sea with a large navy that had come close to rivaling Englands mighty naval supremacy.  Yet the Germans were timid at sending its high seas fleet into action. Why?  Because the Kaiser treasured his fleet and was afraid it might be destroyed or harmed.  <br />The book expertly covers the search for the 'Goeben' and Dardenelles campaign, the fights at sea in the pacific and the standoff at the river plate(Falklands).  These were times when small german surface raiders travlled the high seas seeking out prey.<br />The books climax is the battle of Jutland, an epic battle where Britians 'castles of Steel' confronted the High Seas fleet in  a massive contest.<br />This book is simply massive in scope as well as words.  A wonderful, if lengthy read.  If you have read the first one you will love reading how these fleets confronted eachother, if you missed the first then you will love this one for its scope of history.  Makkie describes in meticulous detail the lives of central characters like Churchill, Beaty, Scheer, Jellicoe, and Beatty, Hipper, and Tirpitz.  Wonderful character sketches bring these great men to life.<br />A sad story about a great German fleet whose commanders, although very skilled, did not have the guts to committ an expensive armed service to battle and the decisive English who gambled everything on the theory that 'every man will do his duty'.<br />A must read, will Makkie write another book, I hope so!	2003-11-03

Its a barren wasteland, a treeless landscape festooned with Polar bears and Reindeer(how exactly did the reindeer get to the island?). In the mid 1700s a Russian ship, blown off course, found itself stuck in the ice near the island. 4 men went ashore and when they returned to the boat it had disappeared. These 4 men would spend the next 6 years in this wasteland trying top survive against the elements.<br />This epic adventure story is told very well by the author, who journeyed to the island to understand the struggle himself. The author tried to understand how these men made the most rudimentary tools, like a bow and arrow from driftwood. These 4 men had many run ins with Polar Bears and somehow survived.<br />An extraordinary adventure tale. An easy informative read. Half the book details the travels of the 4 men on the island while the other half is an investigative report by the author, exploring the village where the men came from and the relics that still exist of their journey and their life on the island.	2003-11-03

Opus Dei is a 'secret' society, in many ways a catholic rival to the masons, meant to promote catholic power among the wealthy and powerful of the worlds catholic nations.  Yet the fact that it is mysterious doesnt mean that it preaches false idols or that it is covering up the 'Truth' about jesus being married. Opus Die is simply catholic reaction to a world increasingly secular.  the author claims this organization is involved in something vile, yet he shies away from saying exactly what.<br />The 'secret' organization that Da Vinci may have been a member of didnt have any knowledge of the life of Jesus, it based its 'theories' on cult pracices that have no basis in reality.<br />In the end this book is a great fascinating tale of suspense, but it is a fictional book.  Lots of people including ABC news have been duped into beleiving this book has 'truth' to it when it is based on NO EVIDENCE whatsoever.  The bible and Josephus are the only documents that speak of the life of Jesus.  In neither work is Mary magdelane spoken of as a wife of Jesus.  In no place is mary magdelane not a prostitute.  The bible is clear on this.  If you dont beleive the biblet hats fine, but you cant just make up history whern no text or evidence exists.<br />Just because Da Vinci painted a fresco doesnt mean anything.  Did Da Vinci know jesus?  No.  did Da Vinci have access to 'secret' documents that were written in the time of Jesus?

In Saudi women can drive, they cant leave the house without written permision of a male, only 4% of Saudi workers are women, in essence this is a fascist country but those being persecuted arnt a race, they are instead a sex.  Thier is something profoundly wrong with a country who sends male delegations to international womens conferences(every other delegate is female).  The Saudis laws are so archaic, and so backwards and none of this is detailed in this book.  Instead the author refers to the country as 'traditiona'.  Hmmm, if traditional means the total suppression of half of humanity then I guess thats accurate, except I always thought traditional simply meant conservative, as in Sicily or Mexico.<br />An informative book but not the whole story.  For a more thorough investigation of Saudi women read 'Nine Parts of Desire'.	2003-10-31

Sometimes extremism requires extremism from another direction, Fujimore represented that.<br />This book was written before the fall of Fujimore and before he tampered with the courts and tried to become a dictator. The book details his upbringing as a minority(Japanese) in a Latin country. His rise to power is something of a rags to riches story of an immigrants child triumphing over adversity, an amazing inspiring story.<br />When he achieved power he set out to destroy the terrorists in the mountains who daily terrorized the average farmers. Unfortunately this is where the book detours from reality. Fujimori's policies were not saintly, he used power and guns to crush terrorism and in the process innocent people lost some of their rights. In the end his ham fisted policies alienated the peasantry, the very people he was trying to help. He did rid the country of terrorists, an amazing achievement but in doing so he hurt many people and this is why he was unceremoniously thrown from office.<br />A biased book, but the only book on this amazing man and his amazing times. Their have been few studies of the rebel movements of Latin America and even fewer books on Peru. until a more neutral biography is released this is all we have on Fujimori, no matter how flawed it is.<br />A small but informative book.	2003-10-31

Many political histories have been written about Saudi(The coming fall fo the house of Saud by Aburish) and many critiques of Sadui have been written(Crude Politics) and their are few if any books examining the Saudi military.  The Saudis joined in all the wars against Israel and used the Oil weapon after the 1973 war.<br />The Saudis have also come into conflict with many of their neighboors.  For instance in the 1950s-60s the Saudis supported the Yemeni royalty in their struggle against the Egyptian supported Nationalists.  Suadi saw Nasserism as a threat to its security.  The Saudis also imposd their will on the UAE, Bahrain and Oman.  The other walks  you through Saudis dispuits with each of tis small gulf neighboors and the border issues with Yemen and Oman.<br />The Saudis greatest threat has come from Iran and Iraq.  The Shi'ite revolution of 1979 saw the Saudis worried about tensions in their own police state against the Shiite minority.  This amazing book explores this problem in detail.  THis book also deals with the problems of Saddam Hussein and a strong Iraq.<br />A very neccesary read to understand the police state of Saudi and why it has been able to exist so long without a threat to its fuedal royal family.	2003-10-31

The authors think somehow that just because someone murders children is no reason to condemn him or even critique him.  To begin with the bias does not help this book.  ALthought he authors ahd much access to Arafats people they seem to have been taken in by some of his propoganda, something the PLO is expert at.<br />Their are only a few books on Arafat.  &quot;Arafat terrorist or peacemaker' by Hart is the most biased towards arafat.  'Arfat: defender to dictator' by ABurish is one of the more ciritcla ones.  two new biographies of Arafat have recently been released one is biased and the other one is more nuetral.  I would have to say this book is the worst of all of them.  THis volume doesnt uncover much new evidence and yet it also fails to give a critical history of the PLO.  The PLO was invovled in almost taking over and destroying two countries, Jordan and Lebanon.  The PLO was thrown out of Syria and Egypt for these very reasons.  Arafat himself, despite his success at survival, is not a lovable character, certainly not as lovable as the authors make him out to be.  Harts volume is more insightful while Aburish's is more palistinian oriented.<br />The saga of Arafat is not over and we will need to wait for a full appraisal of his life.  The recent resignation of Abbas does not bode well For Arafats leadership and neither does the rise of Hamas.  This book is dated and its not thats special.	2003-10-31

This book details the 1954 coup in Guatemala in which a lefitst was overthrown.  THis is reminiscent of the 1973 coup in Chili where Allende was overthrown.  America has been implicated in both coups, yet their is much more evidence for this one.  Guatemla was a hot bed of communists in the 50s, Che Guevara himself was their!  The Americans sent down some dirty tricks people, many of whom would alter be employed as 'plumbers' under Nixon(people like Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy).<br />THis is a quick and interesting read.

Yet this history of portugal remains largelyunderstudied and no other volume exits in English describing Portugals dictatorship.<br />Unfortunatly this book explores more the philosophy of fascism and the interworkings of the government of Salazr rather then looking at the foriegn policy and politics of fascism in Portugal.<br />Portugal, upon the end of Fascist rule, wuickly gave up its colonies in Africa, where Cubans were quickly dispatched to Angola and Mozambique.<br />THis is an interesting book, mostly because it is one of the few on the subject.

The author originally set out to simply observe and learn about the 'women behind the veil'. This is something many of us in the West would like to do since we dont often see Islamic women, instead we ususally are confronted by Imams and Islamic groups telling us how we shoudl view Islam.<br />The author spent time among Islamic women learning of their toils and their hardship as well as their joy.  THis book takes one on a ride through Islamic history and culture as it pertains to women.  The author looks at Mohomed and his treatment of women, his polygamy and the cutting off of womens hands ordered by his successor.<br />The book looks at Iranian women in the time of fundamentalism.  How they were not allowed to touch 'unrelated' men and how this was embarrasing when one met Michael Gorbachev.  She sheds light on the barborous nature of fundamentalism which frequently twists religion to suit its chauvinistic theories.<br />The author looks at Islamic Queens and leaders like Benezir Bhutto who challenged the Koranic 'a people led by a women shall surely fail'. The author then takes us on a tour of the evils of fundamentalism as its ignorance was applied to Rushdie and even towards calls to tear down the 'idolatrous' pyrimids.<br />Lastly the author takes stock of Islam and women.  She cites the fact the women married to Muslim men are 8 times more likely to be killed by their husbands.  She cites female circumcision, the veil, noneducation of women, Polygamy and the murdering of women who dare go without the viel to show the fundamentalism has warped what should have been a beautiful religion.<br />This book is an insightful, intelligent and unbiased account of the lives of women in Islamic society.  The author shows how our own prejudices make it so that musim men who murder their wives actually get shorter sentences because we judge them 'deranged' rather then 'premeditated'.

This author is a noted anti-semite who has written the modern equivelent of the 'Protocols of the elders of Zion'.  This author is also the same person who wrote 'the Israeli Holocaust against the Palistinians' which is a fabrication.<br />This volume sopposedly addresses the nature of the Talmud and Khabballah in Jewish tradition.  The author tries to show the Jews worship the Talmud as a 'god'.  I'm not a genious but the Talmud isnt even used in Jewish prayer and never makes its appearence during Jewish ceremonies.  The Talmud is a legal text that tries to 'put a fence around the Torah' by taking broad interpretations of Jewish laws.  It comments on many thigns including looking at every line of the Torah and debating the meanings of such obscure traditions as the dietary laws.  The Talmud may serve as an arbitrator of theology but it has nothing to do with base Jewish beleifs.<br />This is book is pure anti-semetic tripe full of falsification and quotes out of context.  The author has little education in this area and this book is full of nonsense.  If your one of these 'committed' christians who wants a book about Jewish theology read something like 'back to the sources' or 'to pray as a Jew' which are books about the Jewish texts and will give you an unvarnished look for yourself at Jewish prayer.  This author wants to debunk the Jewish religion, something anti-semites have done for a thousand years, but he has no understanding of Jewish tradition or the place of the Kabballah and Talmud in Jewish thought. <br />As an aside the author claims the Talmud was written by Satan.  Actually it was written by a series of noted Rabbis, so unless you beleive that Jews are a Satanic cult(which is odd since christianity is based on Judaism) then this book is total rubbish.	2003-10-29

It is a fabrication!  Lots of people get sucked into reading this book on anti-semetic websites and because it is sold without an introduction.  This book is like 'Mien Kampf' its a racist hateful book.  Originally this book was published as if it was a 'secret' text written by jews as a plan to take over the world.  It was a fake 'blueprint' for world Jewish domination.  And of course what do you hear from Islamic and neo nazi anti-semites.  You hear daily \\"the jews control the world\\".  This book was the beggining of worldwide 'Jews rule the world' anti-semitism.  Apparently the jews werent very good at ruling the world because the Nazis killed 6 million and Israel can barely keep the west bank.  Hmm, those two facts alone should explode this disgusting rubbish bin book.<br />Unfortunatly many of you will purchase this book because your either ignoratn of its origins or you are an anti-semite.  If your already an anti-semite then save your money because I've already explained what the book says.  If your ignorant then I hope, in fact I BEG you, to go buy 'A lie and a libel:the history of the protocols of the Elders of Zion\\" by Binjamin W.

THis is a very odd book from someone who has written two other great books. Blum's account of the Jewish Brigade in WWI and hisa account of the Yom Kippur War(Eve of Destruction) are both marvelous and TRUE accounts of the events.  Having done extensive research on te Yom Kippur war I can vouch for 'Eve of Destruction's' authenticity.  Yet this book seems oddly out there.<br />First of all the two men this book chronicles Larry Williams and Robert Cornuke have both written books on the subject detailing their adventure.  Now the problem is that the books are in conflict.  WIliams book details two trips while Cornukes book is ambivlent on whether he has found Mt. Sinai and he does not mention Israeli Mossad. So this deminishes the books credibility.<br />The Saudi archeological service cannot be trusted.  Many people claim that the book must be wrong because the Kingdom of Saudi has destributed some pictures of the painting described in this book and these painting look more european then biblical.  Well who trusts the Saudi internal government, which is a dictatorship and has no reason to release evidence about this mountain, especially if such evidence will bring millions of non-Mulsims to the kingdom for pilgrimage.  Saudi already has one holy cty, it doesnt want another.<br />THis book is not racism as some claim nor is it 'offensive' it is merely an exploration of the Biblical site of Mt. Sinai.  THose that accuse this book of being offfensive because these guys had to sneak into Saudi should instead accuse the Saudis of offense for not allowing international research teams to search their country for non-muslim archeology.<br />The Kingdom of Saudi does have a lax intelligence service if your an ex-SWAT member and this is clear from the many terrorist attacks on U.S installations in the kingdom so those that say this cant be true because oft he vaunted Saudi intelligence service are also wrong.  Saudi, as the book shows, is a fuedal state that lives in the modrn world.<br />Those that say the discovery, if true, has ramifactions for the worlds religions are wrong.

One is on marriageand Gods message baout intimacy.  The second is about the 'gathering' where the Jews will be saved from Armegeddon and is the WORST book in the world.  This is the second most useless.  Why?  Because this book puports itself to be a 'historical' insight into the disappearence of the ten lost tribes of Israel.  Yet it is a total fabrication by someone who has no knowledge of Hebrew and no knowledge of the debate souroundignt he subject.<br />Many scholars have actually looked at the evidence sourounding the ten lost tribes?  They used empircal reasoning to determine what might have happaned to these people. How many were their at the time of capture?  Where might the Assyrians have removed them too?  What might they have done?  Evidence exists for the possibility of these tribes ending up in India, Yemen, the Cuacuses, Central Asia, and even Africa. The truth is that rabbinical scholars have also looked into the biblical references to their disappearence and the description of them being in the 'north' which may mean they are simply obscure(disappeared).<br />This author fabricates history by saying the Hebrew Bible contends that these tribes are in fact under the surface of the earth.  Hmmmm, I seem to remember that being from a disney film or something.  Your telling me that a PHD in history can reasonably assume the ten tribes are living AT THE CENTER OF THE EARTH!!!! and will one day reappear.  Wait a sec, this book is fiction...oops oh no its in the wrong section.  I'm not sure why this book is in the non-fiction section but its not a history book or even a philisopphical book or even a theological book.  Its written by a messianic mormon who uses his own wacky ideas to contrive history and lie to us about a bible we can pick up an read for ourselves.<br />So if you are interested in watching someone 'prove' that the ten tribes have built massive underground caves in the ceter of the earth and that they exist down their waiting to return then go read this, if your interested in reality their are other books on the ten tribes and what might have happaned to them.st down their waiting to return then go read this, if your interested in reality their are other books on the ten tribes and what might have happaned to them.	2003-10-28

Somehow he has contrived some passages from the Bible(Hebrew) that talks about armegeddon, the return of the lost tribes and the mount of olives.  Hmm what about reality? Since when does history include the supernatural???  This book purports itself to be a study of the theories regarding the 'end of days' and the return of the ten tribes, yet the qauthor tries to present evidence that these tribes are literally living under the earths crust!!!!<br />That should have been enough for the book the be removed from the non-fiction shelf.  Its like writing a book trying to 'Prove' that Jesus was a viring birth.  How can you prove the supernatural??? you cant.  You cant 'prove' that the red sea opened or that Eve was made from the rib of a man.<br />A terrible book that lacks all intelligence and insults the many Jewish scholars and Rabbinical scholars who ahve explored the meaning of 'north' the missing tribes and the probably existence on this planet today in the form of small minorities.<br />USeless!	2003-10-28

The Assyrians were an ancient people that lived in Iraq and iran and were totally whiped out after WWI as the world community looked on.  The Armenians lost about half their population due to genocide at the same time.  The Kurds, on the other hand, were merely pushed into the mountains of Iraq, Iran adn Turkey where they still exist today.<br />THis book details the fate of minorities in Muslim sosicieties, showing how the new nationalism of Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Iran made average Muslims very intolerant of minorities and pitted age old tribal hatreds against one another.<br />The only flaw thiw book has is it tries to link the three groups as if they have something in common.  Yet the Kurds have nothing in common with the Armenians.  The Muslim Kurds and Christian Armenians were neighboors in eastern Turkey in 1914.  The Kurds had traditionally been rebelious against the Turks but during the war the Turks enlisted them to help keep the christian Armenians in line(due tot he invading christian Russians).  During the period 1915-1922 the Armenains were forcefully removed and forced to march to the deserts of Syria where 500,000 to 1.5 million were murdered, raped or kidnapped.  The Turks used the Kurds to killm most of these Armenians, promising the kurds booty and young girls as the reward for helpingt he Turkish nationalists get rid of this thron in their side.  The Kurds had frequently raided the urban rich armenians prior to the war and were only to happy to now strip the men o f their valuables and rape and marry the 14 and younger girls.  So the author seems to have missed the boat in trying to make it seem like these two minority groups had a lot in common.  In reality the Kurds were involved in the genocide of the Armenians and in some cases the Assyrians during the chaotic period.<br />As a book this is an important resource.  It just important to realize that these groups although all persecuted were actually involved in persecuting one another.that these groups although all persecuted were actually involved in persecuting one another.	2003-10-28

Yet the books main failing is not in its wirting but in its seeking to compromise with a terrible fascist.<br />Mosley was born in 1910, married the son of the Guiness fortune, divorced him and then married the head of the British Union of Fascists.  These were the type of Nazis that the author tries to convey were not scary but simply foolish and wealthy.  ALmost like these people became fascists for fun, like all the aristocrats that became communists(Mr. Philby etc...).  But the problem here is that Mrs. Mosley and her husband were Nazis every bit died in the wool as Hitler himself.  THis book tries to dazzle us with their trips to Germany, their meetings with Goebbells without ever batting an eye to the fact that this woman was complicit in the murder of 6 million Jews and the destruction of Europe.<br />We learn how painful it was for the Mosleys to be imprisoned during the war.  Well they were traitor!  We also learn how Mrs. Mosley tried to rehabilitate herself after the war.  How she tried to rejoin the aristocracy and how boo-hoo it was hard on her because she was never 'truly' accepted back into English high society.  Well why should she have been accepted.  THis is a person who loved Mr. Hitler and though the Nazi program would have been great for England!!!<br />This book tries far to hard to paint a rosie picture of its subject.  THe biographer seems to have been taken in by the 'times gone by' mentality of the old and dying British fascists who romance 'what it was like with Hitler in the old days'.  Well the fact is their isnt anything special about being rich and hateful, theirs nothing romantic about 'aristocratic' anti-semitism, as if some how having blue blood makes it ok to hate others.<br />Not a very fair treatment.  Probably of interest if you too miss 'the times gone by' when the rich could all be anti-semetic and laugh about it and no one saw anything distateful about it.r />Not a very fair treatment.

A million Arabs fled their homes at this time.  At the same time the Arab states expelled about a million Jews.  Almost all these Jews immigrated to israel and settled on the land that had been recently abandoned by the Arabs.  This book traces the steps by which the new Israeli government gave the land a Jewish feel, replacing arab names and changing names of villiges to reflect the new majority.  THe author and his politics condemn this act as a fatal sin against the 'peace loving' Arabs(Palistinians).  He goes so far as to never be able to write the world 'Israel' instead referring to the land as 'Eretz Israel/Palistine' which implies his feelings that the Jews should leave and the land should return to the Arabs.<br />The author tries to show how landmakrs in Muslim Spain still exist in modern spain.  What he means is things like the ALhambra, a fortress so large that the christians simply didnt tear it down.  The fact that a few Islamic monuments exist in Spain is only an example of Christian tolerance, not historical reality.<br />When Islam conquered the Holy Land they changed EVERY single name and murdered every Jew they could find.  When Islam conquered India it changed EVERY SINGLE NAME and destroyed every Hindu Temple it could find.  When Islam conquered Byzantium it CHANGED EVERY NAME(constantinople is now Istanbul as example).  SO whats new?  Apparently the authors thesis is that although lovable Islam cna whipe out civilizations and change all the names the Jews arnt allowed to do this even when they are the majority and even when the NEW villages they mad had no roots in the old landscape.<br />This is a flawed book written for political pupouses by someone who cant wait till the Arabs overun the Jewish state and change all the names back into the 'old' arab names.  Tel Aviv will be called Allah Akhbar(which is a new name since their was no Tel Aviv before the Israelis built it).  Masada will be called 'Allah Allah'.Aviv before the Israelis built it).  Masada will be called 'Allah Allah'.	2003-10-27

Islam means 'submission to god'.  How does this apply to the modern world?  Well the author, Mr. Zimmerman, coming off his succesful expose of Jackson, shows us how Islam preaches hate.  Now what the author explains is that this mainstream hate isnt just your average 'kill the infidel' hate it is actually a deeply ingrained hate.<br />Zimmerman looks into a phenomenon that has taken the Islamic and western world by storm.  Among Muslims the phony book 'Elders of Zion' is widely read and beleived to be true.  But thats not the worst of it, argues Zimmerman.  The Western media today is in cahoots with Islam by becoming so anti-Israel and by beleiving Palistinian lies like the myth of the massacre at 'Jenin'.<br />Zimmerman clearly illustrates the current crises in the west in regards to confronting the intolerance and hate that is widely assocciated with main stream Islam.<br />A great book, that opens the gate to the anti-semitism of the western press and the Islamic world.	2003-10-23

THe author rags on these people beyond beleif in an unbiased manner which smacks of his dislike and knee jerk reaction to the term 'settler'.  But the very brave Jews who live in hebron today are merely extensions of the jewish community that has always existed in hebron.  Unfortunatly this age old community was virtually whiped out in the Arab riots of 1929 and they have only recently returned, standing up to those that beleive they should be thrown into the sea.<br />THis book is a biased account of these Jewish pioneers who settled a wild land and made it productive.  THis is the account of the extension of Zionism into the West Bank and Gaza.  In 1948 the Jordanian army and its arab militias whiped out the Jews of the Etzion Bloc in the West Bank and closed the Old Jewish quarter of Jerusalum.  Yet the author condemns the Jews who wished to return to their ancestral lands following the 67' war.  THis book, one of the few on the subject deserves some merit because it does shed light on these people, unfortunatly its a biased light.	2003-10-21

'No Victory No vanquished' is a useless account written just after the war.  'The war of Atonement' by Herzog is informative.  'Yom Kippur War' by the london insight team is slightly biased against Israel but very informative.  'Two O'clock war' by Boyne is totally americanized and does not have a good grasp on Israel.  This read by General 'Bren' Adan is the most professorial of the books and one of the most dry but also most informative in regards to the SOuthern front.<br />Adan found himself and his unit facing the brunt of the arab attack along the canal in the first days of the fighting.  he lost 1/3 or more of his tanks in a wasted counterattack during the second day of the conflict.  But although wounded his unit went on to cross the canal and take vengeance upon the Egyptians.  This authoritative account is critical of the role of Sharon and commends 'Dado' for his original counterattack plan that was subsequently changed by Gonen.<br />An interesting account of Israeli arms in a time of crises.  the new book by Blum 'Eve of Destruction' is a much easier read but does not contain the detail of this dry account of the war by one of its cheif participants.	2003-10-21

What does diveristy claim.  It claims, as we learn in this fine read, that diversity is essential to success and understanding and tolerance.  THis is actually completely false.  Diverse workforces and diverse college campuses dont actually make anything better, in fact they make people less tolerant.  Diversity is the ideal of the communist left that says everyone(remmember &quot;workers of the world unite you have nothing to lose but your chains!&quot;) is the same and that by mixing us all together in some grand social experiment that we will all be happy.  That sad part is that 'diversity' and 'tokenism' really mirrors far more what queen victoria did at her diamond jubille when all the 'oddities of empire' the diverse masses from all over were paraded in front of the aristocracy.  This is the truth behind diversity.  In fact the liberal would love it if every diverse 'oddity' of humanity could come to college dressed in 'traditional garb' so that we can admire and see them as if they are in some museum.  But this doesnt help the 'exotic' people we bring in to diversify ourselves, it actually mkaes them feel more like outcasts.  Hiring one Sikh and one Hindu and one Pathan and one Gurka and one Jew for your coproation wont help them, in fact they would all be more productive if they worked with eachother against eachother.  The idea that they will become more tolerant is also false.  In most racially mixed societies(Brazil, south africa, Israel, Australia, America) the many races hate eachother much more then they did prior to the mixing.<br />Lets take for example the situation in malaysia when they were building the Petronas Twin Towers.  They had Japanese workers building one tower and koreans building the other.  The teams hated eachother and competed.  If they had been mixed they would have worked slower and they still would have gone to lunch speratly and not 'tolerated' on another.  Here is an example where diversity would not have helped in the workforce.  Diversity is simply the aristocracies latest social experiment to divide us so that they can keep us all down rather then letting us become tolerant on our own.  A great book.ere diversity would not have helped in the workforce.

Failure is a choice. THis books message is that their is 'NO EXCUSE' for the total disaster that is the education system in America.  The author focuses on race(something everyone seems to be into these days) as the barometer of the failure. The authors show how The major divides in education are between the Hispanic/Blacks and the Whites and the Asians.  They show how in essential subjects like math asians are ashamed to leave school with an A- while Blacks are rarely ashamed to go home with a C-.  THe authors further deminstrate that the situation is intolerable, that allowing children to graduate, regardless of race, without having amassed minimum basic skills, like gee being able to read,  or add 6+5.<br />The problem with those that condemn this work is that they claim that the statistics used in this publication(standardized tests and such) are unfair because they dont test the 'individual'.  The flaw here is that it doesnt matter how much 'individual' you want if the kid cant read and cant add then he will be a failure in life.  It doesnt matter how much we want to pretend that 'all students are different and they learn diffeently' if the kids cant read, then they wont get anywhere.  Who cares how different they are, or what CULTURE, they come from, the importance of simple skills can be taught to them.  THe problam with those that oppose the views in this book is that they are justifying failure, they want education taught to the lowest common demoninator with no standardsw whatsoever.  It is a psychology of failure that has taken hold of the education system.<br />People will say when reading this fine work 'well its unfair because these kids are poor they have a harder time learning'.  Well thats odd because 90% of the richest people in America were born poor and somehow they got an education and worked hard.  Their is simply no excuse for a kid that cant do simple alegebra by the 12th grade.  The fact that teachers use race as an excuse to pass that kid from grade to grade is what leads to his abject failure in life and the perpetuating of the racial divide.  The book argues that we must raise the standards for everyone and expect the whites and the Blacks and the Hispanics to achieve at an asian level, and if they dont want to then so be it but then dont blame their failure in life on 'discrimination', blame it on their inability and CHOICE not to learn. Its not cutlrue that makes a person stupid but it is the culture of failure and worshiping stupidity and laziness that encourages kids not to suceed.<br />This is a wonderful book that sets striat the truth behind americs totally useless education system.  THis is the book that will explain to you why every liberal wants to plow more money into public education when their own kids go to private school.  This is the book that will show how Washington D.C spends more per child in education then almost all the states and yet has the 49th WORST scores on all tests and in all subjects.  Where did the money go?  probably it went to teaching about culture and tolerance and diversity so that these kids will be masters of racial understanding but barely able to read.  Have the kids been helped, well they are tolerant and thats good because when they are out working at the gas station they will have to tolerate lots of abuse from annoying customers.s use race as an excuse to pass that kid from grade to grade is what leads to his abject failure in life and the perpetuating of the racial divide.

It is a 'what if' book that goes beyond his normal mathematical approach to human events.  Dupuy correctly illustrates the many'flash points' in the world, places like Israel, Pakistan, Central America, Russia, the Balkans.  Yet he goes to far in 'forcasing' war in these regions.  For instance: Egypt-Libya; their is almost no chance these nations would go to war and if they did the Libyans would be no match for the american/soviet equipped Egyptian army.  Central america:  The peace process here has brought and end to the 1980s style struggle and honestly these nations internal problems would not spill over the way Dupuy forcasts.<br />Dupuys worst scenario if the 6th arab-israeli war.  Why?  Normally Dupuy has been at the forefront of those that say history is important to analyze the future.  But he is using bad history(odd for someone who wrote a book on the arb-israeli conflict) in his look at the 6th arab israeli war.  First: he forecasts a staggering intifada that would help slow down the IDF in its lightning blitzkrieg to take out the combined arab armies.  Dupuy for all is knowledge doesnt seem to realize that in 1967 when Israel took over the west bank the palistinains had a chance to fight alongside the jordanian protectors but they did little to know damage and had no effect on the war in the west bank.  So how could they be any more successful now?  Your telling me a bunch of rock throwing youth and a few guys with old AKs are going to stop the Israeli army, not this is just not the case.  The palistinians wouldnt dent anything and the Israelis wouldnt be forced to 'massacre' them to get through.<br />A flawed book.	2003-10-17

Honeslty the book should simply be reclassified as fiction since its been made clear(through the authors resignation and the rescinindg of the bancroft prize) that the book is packed full of misinformation and fake sources.<br />The thesis of the book, written by an anti-gun rights professor, is that the 'gun culutre' is a new creation of the mid  to late 20th century.  Gee I'm not a genious but we all recall the Militias that went to war in 1776, and they ddidnt go to war with the british holding sticks and stones, they all had guns.  Well if every single house in concord and Lexington was armed then that would lead me to beleive that most of the houses were armed, wouldnt one call this a 'national gun culture'.  It shouldnt have taken rocket science for the author to realize his thesis was flawed, but instead he fabricated history in order to make his thesis work, which is the greatest sin an author can make.<br />Unfortunatly a more liekly thesis could have been 'the national gun culture of today is a phenomenon because we dont need guns for protection the way the men in 1776 did&quot;.  Now this thesis could be proved.  It is true that vast waves of immigrants arriving from the 1840s onward were not gun owners and that the percentage of guns per household declined in the 1860s-90s.  But this doesnt help the author get away from his deliberate fabrications of evidence and sources.	2003-10-16

A great assesment of both the negative and positive in Israeli politics.  The author is quick to critisize Israel for heavy handedness in the 80s and mistakes made in dealing with the palistinians.  Yet he is quick to show the hypocrisy and 'New anti-semitism' in the western media and England in general.<br />He is qucik to show how western jurnalists who go to the middle east frequently do not speak arabic and only interview anti-israeli sources.<br />THe author gives us a case study in the Jenin 'massacre'.  This massacre was reported by the western media on no evidence except stories from palistinian 'survivors'.  The media quickly said mass graves had been dug and hundreds or thousands killed.  The western media hoped that like Sabra and Shatilla no one would investigate and the myth could remain.  But the U.N and many others did investigate and it was found that only 30 or so palistinians had been killed mostly because they were shooting at the Israeli troops.  But this author, a former liberal and someone who comes from Israels left, has finally put his foot down.  He realizes that the internal critique of Israel only feeds the hate of the western press in places like the BBC where old fashioned 'blood libel' anti-semitism has been replaced by 'balanced' reports of the 'holocaust against the peaceloving palistinians'.<br />THis author tells it like it is.  He explains that for all its fault Israel is THE model democracy in the middle east, confronted by brutal fascist terrorists who make it a point to murder pregnant women and little children.  He makes the stand for Israel.  A 'right to exist'.  This is something the BBC has finally proved it does not want.  Uncovering the age old 'aristocratic' anti-semtisism of England the BBC secretly wants Israel whiped out and replaced by a lovable arab  state that will go on to export terror the world over.<br />The author explains how everytime we critisze Israel for defending itself we fuel the terrorist vehicle and embolden them to strike farthur and more brutally against israeli civilians.  The author understands that the U.N and all its organs is the new anti-semitism and that now that Jews have a state its easier to hate 'israel' while pretending you dont hate 'Jews', when in reality most of these pro-palistinian voices are secretly nazi sympathizers who dont have the guts to say they beleive in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.<br />A wonderful book that explores Israel in its time of crises and shows emphatically that Israel has a right to exist free of terror.ze Israel for defending itself we fuel the terrorist vehicle and embolden them to strike farthur and more brutally against israeli civilians.

But this book is simply wonderful.  Mr. Maher quickly hits at the jugular of what we need to do to fight the war on terror.  He understand that airport security should not be PC, and that a 20 year old arab has more chance of being a terrorist then a 80 year old caucasian grandmother.<br />Mr. Maher is correct in his critique of the war on drugs.  We are the ones doing all the cocaine, we should fight the war against drugs here in America, not waste time in Columbia.<br />Mr. Maher also points out the important fact that America and our western way of life and our freedoms are better then Islam.  Mr. Maher hits the nail on the head in his several essays on why we need to beleive in ourselves and that we need to condemn islam for its dictatorships and for its treatment of women.  He makes a great point that the hippie stoner is less dangerous then the stones thrown by islamic fundamentalists.  Mr. Maher also understands that Islams violent invasion of europe does not make it a 'religion of peace', he understands that many Islamic countries live in the dark ages and that we americans should not be afraid to be 'cultural imperialists'.  Maher points out 'your telling me they are mad at us because they have to eat our crappy fast food'.  Good point.  Well siad.<br />Definetly the most enlightening paragraph is when Mr. Maher shows how if a woman in Syria, Iran or Pakistan called the police and siad her husband was beating her the police would say 'and your point is?'.  Maher condemns the backwardness of these Islamic societies and rightfully so.<br />A wonderful book, it redeems Mr. Maher and brings him back into our media culture, his is an IMPORTANT VOICE for america and for freedom and for condemning moral reltavism.	2003-10-14

This is sopposed to be an inside account of the Special Forces. Instead it seems to be a water logged account of a series of totally useless failures of the Special forces.  Now I dont know if this is what Clancy intended but its what the result was.  The Special forces in fact were very effective in Vietnam and in other secret operation throughout the world but we dont seem to hear about much success in this novel.<br />Instead we are treated to long build ups to failed or aborted operations.  Take the Achille Loro inceident.  The ship was hijacked.  THen it wondered around the mediteranean, from egypt to lebanon and back again.  AND THE SOG COULDNT FIND IT!!!! GIVE ME A BREAK! Its a big ship, its not that big an ocean, your telling me the sum total of americas security aparatus couldnt find it.  That one sentence in the book just made me want to throw it away.  Here are the SOGs sitting on the beach in Italy ot cyprus 'contemplating a take down'.  Thats the end, if your guys cant get their craop together enought o go find a boat that size and board it then we might as well disband the SOGs.<br />The book goes on to detail more failures in Greneda and in another incident where an american navy man is killed aboard a hijacked airplane.  In this incednet what did the Special ops do?  Nothing.  They flew back and forth across the mediteranean and then wen thome after allowing the hostages to be taken into the labrynth of beirut.  And Clancy spend a chapter on this, detailing all the sopposed importance of Special Ops.  What was the help of having these anti-terror groups if we do NOTHING but watch.<br />THis is a totally useless book.  It doesnt do anything justice and voers operations that were all either aborted or failures.  Like the operation it spoends pages talking about to free the embassy in kuwait, and then all of a sudden ABORTED.  So why not tell us about something successful?<br />I think the reality is that the co-author Mr. Stiner was a totally indecisive individual who mostly was not able to carry out orders because he didnt have a plan in mind and when he finally came up with a plan washington cancelled it.  I think Mr. Clancy should have profiled a more interesting officer who actually took part in a successful operation.  In fact Sepcial forces have been succesful recently in iraq and Afghanistan, but they were totally useless in the 80s, the period the book focuses on.

It being the 30 year anniverary of the war it is a prescient work of important proportions.  Having just succeeded in his wonderful book 'the Brigade' Mr. Blum now tackles this great subject.  The Yom Kippur war was a truly traumatic event for Israel.  A war that almost launched the 'Sampson option' and one that brought the great powers to the brink of world war.  it witnessed a great airlift ot israel from america and setbeacks, the worst in history, for the ISraelis in the first 72 hours.  Stunning defeats of ISraels Tanks in the Sinai and her air force forced a rethinking of ISraeli military abilities.<br />Blum bring this epic struggle to light in a humaness not seen in most military/political books.  A wonderful account!!! Very human, very much accesible which brings one right to the sinai to face the Egyptian onslaught, then whicks you up to Mount Harmon in the Golan and then back to the stench of the smoke filled Pit where great minds like Mr. Dayan plotted the fate of the Jewish state, watching as counterattack after counterattack failed to dislodge to Egyptians.<br />We learn more insight into the 'Sampson Option' when Golda contemplated launching the weapans that would have ended a million lives in Egypt and Syria, in order to save the remnant of Jewry from genocide at the hands of viscious arabs.<br />A great compendium that showcases two future Prime miniters, 'Arik' Sharon and Netanyaho.<br />A must have for any collection on the arab-israeli conflict. A neccesary work.  Far superior to 'Two O' Clock War' which is weaker.  Also look into 'The Brigade' also by Blum and a stunning account of the Jewish Brigade in WWII.	2003-10-13

Balakian does it again!  Having come off the success of 'Black Dog of Fate' this eminent researcher now adds essential new scholarship to the Armenian holocaust.  Sometimes called the 'secret genocide' or 'forgotten genocide' Mr. Balakian seeks to explore not only the Armenian massacres and extermination campaign of the Turkish government but also American and European response.<br />Balakian takes us on a tour de force as he first analysis American human rights campaigns that culminated in the hundreds of front page stories about the armenian massacres that ranged from the 1890s to 1917 and the subsequent armenian famine.  Balakian shows how noted womens rights figures like Julia Ward Howe dedicated themselves to saving the remaining Armenians.  Balakian reveals the essential humanism of ambassador Morgenthau whose clear understanding and indignation helped form the basis for essential documents explaining the TRUTH behind the Turkish governments campaign to 'end the Armenian question once and for all&quot;.  Also revelaed is the betrayel of the armenians by Wilson(who originally envisioned an armenian state) for Arab oil, something history has seen repeated again and again but with different victims.<br />The Author details the early Hamidian massacres of the 1890s and shows how the culture of genocide became the norm in Turkey as turks were exhorted to do unspeakable acts of cruelty to their fellow man, convinced they were carrying out yet another Islamic Jihad.<br />This wonderful account adds another volume to the paucity of books on this essential overlooked subject.  The land cries out for justice for the Armenians, a people overlooked by history, forgotten, brushed away to the dustbin, but the lord reaches out through men like Balakian to bring the worlds attention to this hidden holocaust, something far to many people have worked far to hard to make us forget!<br />The only misgiving I have is that once again we are treated to the maps of turkey but no maps of the genocides path, no maps of the war, no maps showing figures of Turkish armenians and their deportaiton and how some eventually did survive to live in America, France, Uruguay and Lebanon.  This is one of those windows of scholarship, never tackled to my knowledge, the neccesity to document the armenian diaspora and show the extent of the slaughter with graphs and maps.<br />A must read for anyone interested in human rights, the development of war crimes, Armenians, Jews, American middle east policy and genocide in particular.ps of the genocides path, no maps of the war, no maps showing figures of Turkish armenians and their deportaiton and how some eventually did survive to live in America, France, Uruguay and Lebanon.

As the British at ROurkes Drift and the American at Midway dared to fight to end against superior numbers it was apparent that we, the west, and our values were the central point in why we won.<br />Thier is some question as to how this applies to Alexander in India, as he crushed his enemies through military genious.  Was it because his soldiers were free thinkers?<br />...<br />This is a wonderful read, very well presented.  The author weaves many tales together at once.  When looking at Lepanto, the crucial naval victory that finally ended Islams relentless enslavement and raiding of Italians in the Medditeranean.  The authors contention is that the victory had more to do with the birth of capitalism then the superiority of western military prowess.  Indeed it was the Venicians who led the vanguard into the muslim masses, wading into them with the sword and the cross, but apparently secretly looking forward to the immense profits they would reap upon conqueriing the seas.  True.  This author is brilliant in showing us these esential values of how free market economics and freedom of speach helped us win time and again against brutal dictators whose soldiers never exersized independent thought and were doomed to failure like the Zulus.<br />A great account.

Lets first look at the author, Mr. Kupchan.  He was a staffer under clinton and an admirer of Carter.  He is a devotee of the Noam Chomsky school of politics which states &quot;everything American is evil and America has reached its zenith and is declining&quot;.  Mr Kupchan has been predicting the 'fall of america' for many years.  He began voicing these ideas in the 70s and 80s when he thought America would lose the COld War.  Kupchan and his fellows predicted that Communism was rolling us back in the third world and at our very doorstep(Central America) and that soon America would be isolated and alone.  He saw people like WIlly Brandt and Ostpolitic as the new wave of anti americanism sweeping europe that would soon cripple us.  And then suddenly we won and Russia collapsed.<br />So not Mr. Kupchan has writtena book trying to explain how realists like Huntington and Fukuyama are wrong, when the only wrong person here is Mr. Kupchan.  THe central point in the Kupchan matrix is that the rise of China(he says asia but we know what were talking about here) and the rise of the EU(which just lost a vote in Sweden to join the Euro so how united they are is a mystery) will threaten america in the next decade and overturn us as the sole Hegemon in the world.<br />Kupchan simply doesnt understand what he is talking about.  He never takes into account the FACT that Russia will return strong once again.  he does not analyze the Islamic threat to western civilization(Muslims will soon dominate most european countries where they will make up more then 40% of the people due to their high birth rates and immigration).  He also doesnt analyze the fact that the two strongest EU power centers(France and Germany) are both in violation of EU debt standards for membership.  The only strength in the EU is the small nations like Denmark and those nations are no match for america and have neither the vision nor the resolve for being world powers.<br />As for China, the Chinese are all becoming capitalists as they reorganize their consumer banking system.  Soon China and America will see eye to eye.<br />This book also does not take into account the rise of India and its impact on China and Islam.  Countries like India and Brazil are ont he rise and we must discount this.<br />Not a very credible analysis by someone who has a personal hatred for AMerica.world powers.<br />As for China, the Chinese are all becoming capitalists as they reorganize their consumer banking system.

Beyond this she concludes that this expanded role is sending the military to go where diplomacy would work.  Lets analyze this point by point.<br />1) The war on drugs.  We have committed a few men and lots of equipment to fighting the war on drugs in S. America.  We helped kill Pablo Escobar and we have ehlped spray the drug crops.  Whats wrong with that?  The drug lords have large armies and sophisticated weaponry, countries like COlumbia need our technology and know how to fight this very real war that once threatened to topple the COlumbian government.<br />2) The Balkans.  We committed men and the air force to help the albanians.  Although I think this was a totally useless war that resulted in the murdering of tens of thousands of peaceful christians its apparent that Milosevik would not have budged without force.  Sometimes we need force to accomplish goals, read Clauswitz's 'On War' and you will understand.<br />3)Nigeria:  The author is totally off base here.  We dont have troops in Nigeria except to train the weak innefective corrupt Nigerian military.  Thats the role of a Hegemon like us to help other countries defend themselves and keep order in their region.<br />4)  Afghanistan.  THe author syas that we shouldnt have used our military in the war on terror. Well then whats the military for?  If we cant fight those that murder our civilians then I guess we should just give up.<br />5) Indonesia: We are helping crush the indonesian islamic militants who are murdering civilians and christians daily.  THis is part of the war on terror.

The anti-semite will enjoy this book so that he can say \\"see I knew those jews would have done the same to the germans, the germans were just pre-empting them\\".  And it serves those thirsting for revenge(like Abba Kovner who wanted to poison the Germans waiting in the detention camps).  Unfortunatly this book is of dubious accuracy.  it claims that the russians used Jews to guard the millions of German prisoners they capture din Poland and used Jews to round up the Germans indigenous to Poland.<br />What is true is that many German prisoners disappeared.  it is true the russians killed as many Nazis as they could.  it is true the Russians crushed the German community of Poland, uprooting many of them for slave labor and other things.<br />Its dubious that the few jews still alive in Poland could have been enlisted in this effort.  Most of the Jews left in Poland were immediatly subjected to progroms by the Poles and many fled to israel or fled west.<br />The books account while sparcely accurate by no means constitute a Jewish holocaust against the germans, which is what the author tries to show.  An interesting read.  Maybe a forgotten part of history but probably just a creation of a vivid imagination, probably no one will ever know what happaned to the Germans of POland and the German POWs.	2003-09-29

For a decade the white minority government of Ian Smith had been fighting a losing struggle against Mugabes Marxists.  The Rhodesian government had 'declared independence' from England in order to continue the war which England had encouraged the government to negotiate a ceasefire and allow for a majority government.<br />We all thought that Zimbabwe would now have equal rights for all.  This book details what happaned and the horror that Mugabes country has become. Mugabe promised land reform, what he meant was that he would take every inch of white land and reward it to his 'boys'.  His followers grabbed the white land and then they did nothing with it and soon a country that had been exporting grain and food was on the brink of national starvation.  Mugabe could have devided the land fairly and could have given it to the blacks who had farmed it for years under white rule but instead he gave it to his corrupt 'boys' and ruined the economy.<br />Next Mugabe became a dictator.  He had fought against what he called white dictatorship but he then became a dictator himself, like all communists who promise freedom but only bring slavery to their nations, Mugabe quickly outlawed freedom of the press and civil rights and imprisoned those that spoke against him.<br />THis wonderful book written by a man who was born in Rhodesia tells the story of idealism gone awry.  Her majestys government in England that had orginally called for a settlement now has snactions on Mugabe and opposes him at every turn because England knows the Mugabe is a viscous dictator worse then the white government he replaced.  The people are Zimbabwe are starving.  They were better off under Smith when at least they had some freedoms and food.  Now the country is a disaster and this book is one of the few to expose the truth.  A riveting tale, a must read for africa buffs.

It begins by exploring Rwanda past and the colonial initiatives that exacerbated a tribal conflict.  It shows how years ot Tutsi rule infuriated the Hutu majority and turned them into beasts worse then the SS.<br />The author explores individual cases of people adn the memories they faced.  He takes a sharp cirtique to the U.N and the world community who sat by and watched.  He carefully lays out the lies perpetrated by the French and Belgium troops in the country that watched as people were butchered in front of them.  The author explored the obivous nature of the genocide as rivers choaked with bodies polluted the lakes of Kenya it was obivous what was happening.<br />Once again, as was the case of the Jews in Germany, we see a minority people subjected to brutal behavior and not fighting back.  it seems the curse of people chosen for genocide that tehy are always the weakest people who chose not to fight to the death.  The Tutsi community allowed itself to be herded like cattle and watched as their relatives were butchered.<br />The author explores the legacy of 'Justice' in rwanda.  he shows how many war criminals are now living here in the U.S and the world does nothing.  The author shows how the U.N only seemed to become upset when the Tutsi rebel army took back the country and the U.N was suddenly worried about 'retalitaion'.  Apparnetly the U.N doesnt mind if you murder a million people but when one of those people decides to take a little vengance then all of a sudden the U.N steps in to stop the criminals from getting a taste of their own medicine.<br />The author goes on to show how the U.N helped to arm the committers of genocide as they fed them in refuggee camps.  THe U.N supported the former war criminals as they fled to congo and continued the campaign of genocide.  The U.N did everything except helping the victims, the U.N only helped the prepetrators.<br />This is a wonderful book where you will learn that the world will never change.  The U.N and the 'world community' loves genocide and the more people you murder the more they will support you.  If you are a peaceful nation like Tibet the U.N will ignore you and give you no aid.  But if you are brutal like Saddam or Pol Pot the U.N will spend years helpign you and feeding you and your people.  This is the lesson of the Rwandan genocide.

This 800 page volume contains many useful maps and pictures which will be helpful.  Coverage is well done.  Their is some question as to the accuracy of the entry detailing the rvolt at Auschwitz as various sources(\\"Anatomy of a death Camp') have put the number of Germans killed at 4 or 5 while 'Doctors Eyewitness account' put the numbers at as many as 100.  Clearly something is missing.  THe SS kept such extensive records of the numbers of Jews they killed one would think that someone could unearth the number of SS killed/hospitalized after the crematorium revolt.<br />Nonetheless this large piece of information will be helpful for reference.

Gilbert shows the many competing politics of Poland that also fueled the hate and destruction of the Jews in that country.<br />Gilbert does not show, however, the importance of the Danish King who did so much to save the Jews.  This is a lost chapter that deserved more work.<br />The book is one of a kind and deserves to be read.  Gilbert obtained his list of the 'Righteous' from Yad Vashem and he has been loyal to the Israeli official list of those that helped the Jews.<br />It to bad that with such a long list of people that saved even one person the book ends up sometimes feeling like a long list of names and short descriptions of deeds.  Their might have been a better way to present it and still uphold the message Gilbert was trying to make.  Gilbert also shows how it has taken so long for people to be recognized for their deeds, a tragedy unto itself.  These people that risked their lives to save just one person, are so important because they show to us what can be done in the face of evil.<br />This book will help you understand how if you save one life you save the world.o long for people to be recognized for their deeds, a tragedy unto itself.

'nonsensational material' is how the book bills itself.  What does this mean?  That the death of 7 million people, the attempt to exterminate a people(whose only crime was that they didnt meet psuedo-scientific racial criteria) is not sensational! What an awful way to begin.<br />Next this volume is weaker then the Laqueur 'Encyclopedia of the holocaust' which is a much more authoritative volume that includes tomes more information, has more pcitures and more maps and is sensational in that it doesnt dumb down the TRUTH.<br />This encyclopedia continues the virulent anti-semitism that tries to convince us that the 'Jews' were a 'people apart'.  How can this be when we all know Jews held top jobs in the governments, businesses, colleges and medical insistutions in both Poland and Germany.  The attempt to blame the holocaust on the Jews by showing us the object of the 'wondering Jew' is something that seems to seap through the introductory passages of this book.<br />Stating that teaching the holocaust is mandatory in most schools and that hsi book will be helpfull is a nice and noble goal.  But it doesnt seem to be a valid reason for creating a compendium of holocaust material.  Shouldnt we have an encyclopedia of the holocaust not just because kids are 'required' to learn about it?<br />This volume does not include the variety of contributors(although  they convinced Yad Vashem to contribute) nor the plethora of maps and pictures that other similar works include.

This was an epic battle that took place in 1939 between Japanese forces and Russians under the command of Zhukov.  In this conlfict it quickly became obivous that the japanese forces were vastly inferior to their russian counterparts.  Although brave the Japanese Armor, and planes and weapons were inferior.  Zhukov, a military genious, eventually routed the japanese army causing horrendous losses to an army that had hiterhto only known victory against the militarily inferior Chinese.<br />Russia gained a hero from this conflcit, Zhukov.  He was able to test his theories regarding the goruping of armor, and his victorious tactics would later be used against the Germans.<br />Nomonhan should have ended the superiority complex of the japanee military.  They should have taken these lessons to heart.  Unfortunatly the only thing they learned was that they should not try a full scale invasion of russia(this is why they did not help Hitler in 1941).  They should have learned that America would have even better technology then the russians and a war with America would be disastrous.<br />Nomonhan is a fascinitating story of two imperial countries facing off for months of brutal fighting in which thousands perished and yet neither country declared war oin the other.  This mirrors the confrontations between Russia and China in the 60s and the confrntatiosn between China and India in the 50/60s when it became apparent that the Indians were no match for the Chinese(thus shattering Nehrus nerves).<br />A very long book, very detailed with easy to read amps detailing the campaigns.  The classic and sure to be the staple on this subject for decades to come.  The other 'Nomonhan' book by Colvin is weak and inaccurate.  This 'Nomonhan' is written mostly from the Japanese point of view, thats its only downside.	2003-09-26

He was a modern day King David(from whence his name comes).  FOllowing in the footsteps of the modern day prophet Herzl.<br />I was very excited to read this book.  These were the essential years of Ben Hurion and the essential yeas of the modern Jewish State.  This was the time of the founding of the settlements, this was the time when Jewish land ownership in Palistine increased 10,000% and when Zionism stopped being a dream and became a reality.<br />Ben-Gurion was the engine of this.  Emigrating to Israel after the turn of the century he helped dound the Jewish labourorganizations that came to dominate the Yishuv, eventually he steered the World Zionists away from Wiezman to support him, while at the same time opposing Revisionism(Manachem Begin and Jabotinsky).<br />THis book should have been a more interesting read but I found it focused to much on Gurions personala ffiars(his letters, afairs, feelings) and focused too much on the many little posts he held in numerous useless organizations(all of whom have been religated to the dustbin of history).  THis book should have given his life more persepective by detailing the general modd of Israel and the amny events taking place while he lived their.<br />Yet instead of detailing Gurion AND the birth of Israel, this book only details GURION.  What about the creation of the settlements?  The land dispuits? THe birth of the Haganah?  What about WWI and WWII.  it seems much was skipped ehre because the author wanted to focus on the personal life of Gurion and his immense ego.  I became a little bored and disiluusioned and time after time I had to read about some little useless speach Gurion gave at soem meeting no one remmembers.<br />THis book had greatness in it grasp for detailing such an amazing period(see 'One Palistine Complete' that is also a total let down of leftist rhetoric).  I prefer books like 'terror out of Zion'  Martin Gilberts 'Israel A history' and 'Blood and Fire' to this read.  Maybe I will have to purchase the biography of Jabotinsky to learn more about this period because I was not enlightened with this volume.

Most people interested in WWII are slightly familiar with North Africa.  The baptism of fire at Kaserine pass, the emergence of Patton and Ike and the fighting against the Vichy French.  Yet this essential campaign has never been fully excplored.  Here finally is a book worthy of the study of this important theater.<br />The author looks closely at the American struggle to liberate north africa.  It begins with the invasion of Vichy held lands.  It continues on to the failures at Kaserine and Pattons assault on the remnants of the German army in Africa.  A wonderful account, easily readable with highly detailed campaign maps that explain every battle and every encounter.<br />A must have for the WWII enthusiast.	2003-09-25

But in many ways, like the historical fate of Ariel Sharon(another brash military genious), Patton has been attacked.  Accused of not obbeying orders in Sicily(which he didnt), accused of doing little more in North Africa then let the Germans surrender(the British sopposedly having already beaten them) and accused of stealing gas tor ace across France while the British and american infantry did most of the work.<br />Well lets analyze this more closely.  THis book is a revisionist account.  Well researched but badly presented.  it starts from the beggining.  it does not give Patton the credit he deserves for his genious in the Lousiana Manuevers.  Then the author(due to his agenda) must disparige Patton in North Africa.  Of course the reality is that the American army was a disaster in N. Africa prior to Patton, he energized the troops(who had been shattered in their first encounters with veteran German units).<br />Then the author must repeat the accusation the Patton was a failure in Sicily.  Lets get this straigt.  Patton and his men went three times as far as the British units and crushed twice the opposition, eventually capturing the two biggest cities on the island, and thats a failure.  Its only a failure in the eyes of someone who wants everyone tof ollow orders no matter how irrational.  patton was unorthodox like Stonewall, thats what wins wars, not textbooks.<br />Patton 'Genious for War' is the superior account.  Written by veteran historian Carlo D'Este it presents a balanced and good portrait of this military genious, a true character, a lot better then General Wesly Clark(Ashley Wilkes).	2003-09-25

Carlo's biography differs in that it covers only the war period.  Weak on the Lousiana Manuevors it does detail essential aspects of Ike's career.  It explains his terrible experience as staff officer to Macarthur.  It also shows his dull career as an army nothing in which he trudged through years of worthlessness before being appointed the top job in Europe.<br />Ikes story is purely American.  Unnoticed for years, with a less then interesting record at West Point, he was picked by Marshall to lead the men ashore in N. Africa.<br />This biography explains the essential Ike, the books Maps are well presented and show the tactivcal units that most books fail to show.  Nevertheless the writing lacks and Este's account does not do him justice.<br />Carlo is well known writer on WWII, his books on Patton and his books on the Italian and Sicialian camapigns are one of a kind, but this focus on Ike is not his best work.	2003-09-25

THis new treatise is well worth the time though.  It probably doesnt reveal new information but it does present existing information in a highly readible and riveting format.  This read also emphasis the Peace Conferences effects on Turkey, the Middle east and Africa and Asia.  Most books on the conference emphasize the redrawing of europe, the book gives a broader and more insightful interpretation.<br />The chapter set up in this book are excellent.  Covering each incident seperatly the author investigates the birth of Poland, Yugoslavia, the territorial disputes of eastern europe and of course the long vaunted reparations.<br />The author analyzes the players, Lloyd George, Wilson and Clemenceau.  It also looks at luminaries like the Greek Statesman and Ataturk's effects on the conference.<br />This riveting account helps lay the groundwork for the many territorial disputes that effect the world today.  Included are the authors observations of the creation of Palistine and Transjordan as well as the Lebanon, two states that would arbor much unrest in the second half of the twentieth century.<br />Important events such as the Armenian genocide are not overlooked and this lends credibility to the volume.<br />A very readable account, not easily put down, highly recommend.	2003-09-25

THese quotes are anti-semetic and sensationalistic in nature since we all know that only one Jewish act of terror has taken place in the last ten years(Mr. Baruch Goldstien).  yet during the struggle for independence Jewish Terror organizations romed Palistine striking fear into the hearts of arab fascists and British administrators.<br />On July 22nd, 1946 an explosion rocked Palistines best hotel, the King David, killing 91 people.  It was the most profound act of terror during the British madnate.  this bloody incident helped convince the British of the hopelessness of palistine and helped strengthen Jewish resolve.<br />This is the riveting, page turning, story of the Jewish underground organizations who struck back, first at the Arabs in revenge and then at the British to achieve independence.

Actually this book is totally useless.  Here the authors dig deeper into the magic, the sophistry, of Six Sigma.  Please tell us more practitioners of this blind faith.<br />This book details how to create the teams needed for Six Sigma.  First it explains the role of the 'black belt' and 'master black belt'.  We're not given insights into why a business model for grown ups has to treat us all like children, having teams and coaches and lots of 'feel good' language invovled.  How bout a chapter on firing lazy employees?  How bout a chapter on what to do when 10% of the items coming off the line are defective?  No, that would be too realistic.  No wholesome language,  Just wizardry.  When every single item coming off the line is defective we must sic the teams on it and analyze the issues, the diversity, the feel goodies of it.  How bout just firing every single person on the line?  This book is pure sophistry detailing a fad, a flavor of the week approach developed at GE and now appearing in every book in the world on business.<br />Business existed before Six Sigma and it will exist when this flawed system is gone.	2003-09-24

Ok so you get  the point.  Six Sigma is a useless business model that does nothing but repeat itself and denigrate itself upon the masses who coulndt understand it anyway.  This book tries to explain to us loeman what Six Sigma is.  Unfortunatly no one knows that six sigma is becuase its a scam.<br />Six Sigma is another 'fix all' for managers.  Sopposedly it makes companies more efficient, makes 'cycle' times less and creates less defects in the line.  How about just hiring competent employees, paying them more, training them better and shooting union organizaers?  Wouldnt that do the same thing?  How bout firing every employee associated with a defect in a product?  How bout having a computer stamp out the product, since humans are flawed?<br />Six Sigma tells us what we already know.  That we can do things better and we can analyze how we are doing something in order to do it better.  Six Sigma bills itself as the end all be all and managers slough it off on hapless middle management to use.  But middle management cant understand it anyway.<br />Six Sigma is like a religion to companies like GE and Motorola, who blame all their success on it, yet what these companies dont realize is that they convinced themselves to do better, it had nothing to do with a flawed, out of style and useless business model.<br />This book goes beyond most trying to explain this system.  Yet it doesnt analyze the essential flaws of SIx Sigma, mainly that the words themselves are meaningless and the system is a total scam.	2003-09-24

So he 'invented' six sigma.  a totally useless business model.  Towards the end of his book he becomes so esoteric that he seems to have lost grasp of what running a company means.  Living the good life and waltzing around with a new woman apparently got to his head.  Six Sigma is cute but its useless if thats the only thing you focus on, some esoteric model that has nothing to do with down to earth business, its a number crunchers dream but a realists nightmare.<br />A terrible treatment.  Iaccocas book is more real and down to earth.  This book started out with a down to earth irsihman who built himself up but it ends with someone who has a head thats too big for us all and thinks he is better then the world(strolling around in his cheesy kashmir sweaters).<br />Jack wastes pages and pages detailing all the waste he contributed to charity and community involvement.  My company has a community involvement program, I wouldnt volunteer if I was paid to.  Business shouldnt be wasting time in lobbying or in charity, it should do what its essential goal is, to do business.  Leave charity to the philanthropic organizations. If Jack really cares for charity as much as his book says he does then I feel sorry for the people at GE, forced to waste time with kids and art and useless things like that they could be doing on their own time.<br />Not a fan.  Yet there are parts of the book that detail some interesting parts of GE. Like when Jacks Predeccesor says to him \\"if a plane crashed and everyone was killed in the top leadership who would you save to lead the company\\".  And then \\"what three people would you want to live to manage the company.\\"<br />So it deserves a few stars.  Besides like Henry Ford, I dont trust anyone with a PhD running a company.	2003-09-24

Truly a tale of endurance and originality.  This was the only state ever created in the americas not relying on colinialism to create it.  Here the 'Saints' built schools, railroads and an army.  The settled the land from California to Nevada to Arizona and beyond.  The almost came to war with the American government in 1858.  Some mormons massacred a group of Gentiles traveling through Utah(but gee history seems to have forgotten the massacres of mormons back east).  We learn of the regime of Young.<br />The book details the indian wars and immigration.  Like estbalishing the state of Israel by the Jews, these pioneers esablished their own Zion which in many ways parrallels the creatiion of the Jewish state a 100 years later.<br />This bridges the gap between the mormon histories of Nauvoo, the hero making of Orrin Port Rockwell, and the modern mormon books that detail the power and secrecy of the chruch.  This book also goes beyond the sensationalistic accounts of the Mountain Meadows Massacre(titled 'American Massacre' it would have been more aptly named for the Waco massacre in 93.)<br />An important book, well written and structured so as to make it easy for the reader to grasp.	2003-09-23

Lets simplify this.  She looks at the 'Zealots'(lets recall Zealots were jews who fought the Romans so her term is wrong), Jews who have settled in the west bank and apparently have not so nice things to say about their Muslim naighboors.  But Stern wants us to compare these people, and Jerry Fallwell to a Muslim about to strap on a bomb.  Lets compare here.  The Jewish guy wears a flack jacket to get to work and guards his kids so they can go to school, he hates the terrorists and maybe he hates Palistinians but he is not a killer.  Only one jew in the last 10 years has murdered Muslims in an act of terror and that was Dr. Baruch Goldstein(you can look him up I dont have room to tell his story).<br />Now how many people did Stern interview that were about to go murder in the name of Christ?  none.  instead she wanted us to beleive that religious christian conservatives, alla Jerry Fallwell, were about to take up the sword for the new crusade but they ahdnt found the sword yet(were they choosing between an Ar-15 and an AK-47???)<br />Stern then interviews some muslims who are about to strap on a bomb and go blow up some 'infidels' after the interview.  She wants to explore thier souls and 'understand' why they are prepared to die in order to help cleanse their country of hated christians and hated women who display more then a finger.<br />Whats the line here Stern? That  a born again baptists, a Jewish settler and a Muslim terrorist are the same.  This book is the ultimate in moral equivilancy.  Sterns point is that we americans also have terrorists, we need look no furhtur then the christian right.  But this is false.  The christian right has committed no terrorist acts(unless you want to label Mcveigh a christian then  thats one).  Stenr wasnt after the mcvieghs of the world though she wanted to show that christianity produces terrorists, yet she is wrong.  Judaism dont produce one onehundredth the number of terrorists that Islam does.  THis is because, as Stern does not point out, Islam is profoundly intolerant in its militant form.  Their are no Jewish terrorists, so she shouldnt have even included Jews in the book.  She could have looked at Sihks who have killed in the name of god, but she was apparently not open minded enough to realize they exist.<br />A terrible, rambling account that only justifies terror at the expense of christianity and Judaism.produce one onehundredth the number of terrorists that Islam does.

He explores many new anectdotes and reviews many specific examples of empire, while weaving together a story that ultimatly leads him to conclude that America should export the values of free market democracy abroad.<br />How does the author explain the virtues of empire, something most opf us are taught is evil in grade school?  The author shows that british common values and british obsession with order and the legal system made for leaps and bounds in development from China to Belize.  When one contrasts former English colonies with other former colonies(be they portuguese, French or Spanish) one will see a higher proportion of democracies among the former english colonies.<br />Lets look at a few points.<br />No Former british colony has engaged in genocide against its own people, while Former french colonies like Rwanda have.<br />Most former british colonies are democratic:  Australia, Botswana, S. Africa, Belize, Jamaica, Kenya, U.S, Canada, India etc...  How does one explain that neighbooring countries like Ethiopia, Cuba, Angola, Indonesia, Mexico are mostly either dictatorships or near dictatorships with one party rule?  It cant just be bad luck, it is in fact that the British took time to educate their colonial citizens in the British system, creating a democratic elite.  THis was the case in India.

He grew his hair long and had dark penetrating eyes. A 'Man of god' an early convert to Mormonism he became one of Smiths most trusted men.  When Joseph was killed he had risen to become a defender of the Mormon church, but a defender who preffered the gun to the good book and a horse to the pulpit.  Rockwell helped lead his people west and then his legend grew.  He fought indians and crushed anyone who would threaten the church again.  He helped found Deseret, the mormon nation and carved a living out of the hard scrabble desert of Utah.<br />He served as a Church leader for many years and the eastern press never forgave him for his involvement with the Danites, a secret society that took vengeance upon the gentiles who persecuted Mormons up and down the old northwest eventually chasing the Saints out of Missouri and Nauvoo.<br />This harrowing story of blood and guts and honor is told in a folksy manner that brings you back to the camp fire for one more round of tales.  The most amazing poart of this book is that Rockwells story is true.  An american classic.<br />A great read for anyone interested in the history of the Mormon church, the american west, or the individual tradition of self defense.	2003-09-23

His next book was a landmark account of the 1998 death season on Everest where about 20 people went 'into thin air' and never returned including the guide for the group Jon was with.<br />Now Jon has put his sights on the radical Mormon settlements and critiqued religion in the process.  Maybe Jon should visit Mecca to see some read fanatics or even the west bank and see some orthodox Jews(do they take the Uzi's off in the mikveh???).  Jon K has drawn our attention to the many small settlements of Mormon radicals who dot the western hemisphere.  He wants us to beleive these viscious religious people are somehow a threat to normalcy.  Maybe they are a threat to the wine and brie crowd, but these religious fanatics dont want to stroll donw fifth avenue, they want to be left alone.<br />Krakauer brings our attention to some guy who has 20 wives or something(and of course he must point out that Brigham Young had lots of wives, the last of which was a teenager).  Yet Krakauer does not mention Henry the 6th or Mohommed who both had teenage wives among the many they had.  Why is this? Is Krakauer afraid that He might be english and theirfore a descendent of Polygamous Henry VI or is Jon afraid of offending America's new privilidged class, the muslims.<br />Polygamy is practiced in Islam after all.  So why is bad when radical Mormons want to have a few wives?  Eh Jon?  Why is it ok for the Saudis, but not us Americans?  Or is Krakauer just jealous he cant get more then one lady at a time.<br />This book is a waste.  it sopposedly bills itself as shedding some light on religous fanatics but in fact it doesnt. All fundamentalist religious people are mostly the same, they keep to themselves and they act strange(go visit some hasidic Jews and youll understand).  But its strange to us and to draw such fire upon them and castigate them and then to imply that Mormonism as a religion is upsetting because these radicals exist is just a bad conclusion to a book that did no need to be written.

Thank you kind sir for helping to educate us and show the the truth behind the new Jihad being waged in eastern europe.  This book has helped awake me to the turht behind the destruction of Orthodoxy in the lands of Kosovo and Croatia.  The western media has overlooked this because it is biased and disgusting.  It is worse then the holocaust because the media now knows the truth about the cleansing of serbs but ignores it because the media is pro Muslim and hates christians, expecially christians who stand up for themselves(probably this is why the media doesnt mind the holocaust because the Jews went like sheep, had the jews fought to the last as they did in Warsaw the media would have called them racist against the nice germans).  This is the case in Kosovo,and this book tells the truth, that one day we shall reclaim our ethnic land and force the foreign monster back to from whence he came.	2003-09-21

Its nice that we are taught to view Islam as a \\"peacefull\\" religion and encouraged to understand Islamic culture and its architecture and philosophy(oh and how can we forget lovely Islamic poetry).  This book points out that not all is cute and loving on the other side of the border, behind the Mosques closed doors.<br />This book explains the passage in the Koran \\"take not Jews or christians as friends\\".  How the Koran encourages every member to fight at the frontier to become a martyr and take Jihad into the world of Dar al-Hard(where we live).<br />So while today western governemnts in the search for secularism are finding the bible to be a 'hate speech' book then we must focus our attention on intolerant Islam.  If you tried to find all the parts of the bible that sopposedly show hate towards Gays then you will find ten times the hate in the Koran, Gabriel shows us that the Koran includes literally hundreds of pages encoruaging the Muslim to murder us(non muslims) and to stone gays and oppress women.  How can we tolerate these people and this religion in our midst?  If Gabriel is to be understood, then the time is ripe to begin the new Crusade against this viscious insidous religion that enncoruages our death, how can we tolerate a people amonjg us who want everyday to kill us and rape our daughters(which was the fate of the Sihks and Coptic christians and Lebanese and Ethiopian christians and Armenians and Jewish tribes of Saudi and countless other minority groups in Islamic societies.???<br />An important landmark book.br />An important landmark book.	2003-09-20

THey suffered the same fatigue and even got to weat flack jackets and halmets, but they didnt get to carry guns because the military felt the western press could not be trusted as they might turn the guns on the american soldiers(most western media is anti american, anti democracy and islamic in nature and practice).  This book details the very good, loving nature of the american military and how it nurtured the reporters, giving them unfettered access to events, something the russians wouldnt do.  Now we must look at something else, pertinent to this equation, the press was embedded, therefore it was protected, unfortunatly, from the evils of Saddams empire.  Some of the press should have been released to expereince the torture chambers for themselves so they could have given us an unbiased account of how nice Saddams regime was.<br />A great book./	2003-09-19

America is a brutal place where people have all these disgusting freedoms, like religion, speach, those types of sins.  Now America is also evil, as this book shows clearly, because we invade countries that produce terror.  This is the argument presented in this book and books like it.  Here the author argues that our strength, the fact that we are the sole hegemon in the world, is having consequences for us and the world.  Well clearly.  The question is are these consequences bad or good?  The author argues they are bad and that America is taking far to active and over bearing role in the world.  The author needs to rethink this.  If the communists or fascists had triumphed what kind of world would we live in?  They would be MORE overbearing.  Islam is more overbearing, isnt it?  So maybe a taste of Amaericana is what the world needs, the author doesnt put his book in historical prospective.  Its a fallacious account.<br />See we learn from Mr. bacevich that americas policy is mean and viscious because we stand up to dictators and because apparently we didnt allow more terrorists to kill our civilians.  Many years ago america helped muslims defeat communism so clearly we deserved the 'blowback' when those same people decided to take us down a notch.<br />America the bad.

How Asad invaded Lebanon and how he never stopped fighting the Israelis.  In Fact Syria remains the one country bordering Israel to have not signed a peace treaty and exchanged ambassadors.<br />Asad is a truly modern man.  A secular socialist from a minority sect in Syria he crushed the fundamentalist Muslims at Hama, killing more then  20,000(remmember the only rile is that muslims are allowed to kill eachother but westerns get critisized for dooing so).  This he rid his country of the fundamental extremeists that one find in other nations.

Why do we need albright?  Because Albright will help Islam conquer the west.  Albright will help the albanians topple most of their neighboors and we will bomb the civilians to stop these people from defending themselves.  Albright is the greatest secretary of state in modern memory(the last 2 years are an exeption) and this book details every exploit, every inch Jihad came closer to our shores, every helping hand we gave to communism and terrorism and fascism.  Albrights book is just a wonderful necceary aaccount of americas foreign policy.<br />She details how an foreign policy of invading countries that support terror is viscous.  She shows how a better foriegn policy is supporting terrorists because if we support them enough they will become wealthy and then hopefully they wont have time to waste blowing themselves up because they can hire someone to do it for them.  Albright explains in this book how she helped the PLO build airports and schools and day care centers so that the terrorists could mor easily get his bombs from Iran(the airport) teach his children the art of bomb making(schools) and then put his kids in day care while he went to become the next martyr.  This policy was well on the way to achieving her goal(the destruction of israel) when viscious right wing neo conservatives stole the 2000 election.<br />A must read to understand americas morasss.	2003-09-19

THis volume illimunate the crusades in a new way and help you understand the propoganda that claims they were wrong and for greed.  In fact the crusades were a response to Islamic aggression whereby Christian chruchs were destroyed in the holy land and christians enslaved.

Some will debate this raising the name of Mitterand, but De Gaulle looms over france like an albatross as the conscience of the nation.<br />De Gaulle was influenced as a young man by the injustice of the Dreyfuss case.  The hatred of inequality would later convince De Gaulle to fight to the death rather then submit to Nazi terror.<br />The book details De Gaulle as the war hero in WWI.  He went on to write about the new generation of tanks and how best to employ them(as the Germans would) in concentrations.  During WWII De Gaulle found himself watching the government vascilate and finally give in to the hated Germans.  To cap it off De Gaulles WWI hero Petain was the one to give in to the Nazis.  De Gaulle fled to Britian to carry on the conflict and he was found guilty of treason by the Vichy french.<br />De Gaulle carrried the honor of france abroad, helped to liberate hte colonies from the Vichy and finally leading the french back to Paris.

This book will explain why Coolidge's simple ways made him one of the most imporant presidents of the 20th century, not because he accomplished alot but prescisely because he set out to do as little as possible.<br />Reagan thought Coolidge was an American hero.  Why?  This book will explain the great enigma of Calvin Coolidge.  Coolidge emerged as an American hero when  he stood up to the Boston Police department when they went on strike.  He fired them and hired new officers because this was a time of anarchy in the city and the people needed security.<br />As president Coolidge vowed to keep his hands off government, off taxes and away from the public space.  He beleived what was good for business was good for America, and he helped support the rising market.  Coolidge wanted to pass as few laws as possible so as to keep the government from encroaching on the people.  He was a true Jeffersonian.<br />Coolidge was sworn in with his family bible.  He never travelled abroad(except Cuba) and never flew in an airplane or went down in a submarine.  He was the last of a dying breed of simple politicians who valued the simple american life.  This is an important addition to any collection of American political biography and an important read for someone perplexed with the current governments invasion into our daily lives.	2003-09-17

We must recall that the Egyptian media was telling the Egyptian people that hundreds of Israeli planes had been shot down in the Six day war, so the authors reliance on figures that are inaccurate &quot;more then 200&quot; is not exceptable.<br />Nevertheless this book adds to the scholarship on the Yom Kippur war.

Its not enough that in school history is being balkanized into little diverse gorups of multicultural hysteria, now the originas of man and the scientific community have to be racialized so that the new PC look of Jesus(as a black man) can fit the program of the leftist race baitors.  This book uses a disgusting title and terrible cover to induce us to read about 'the real origin of mankind'  a thesis that is neithber provable nor even dabatable with the evidence we have at hand.<br />Oppenheimer tries to use new evidence to prove that their was one vast migration out of Africa that served as the basis for modern man and of course, modern mans racial characteristis.  Very importnat to learn about race because its so central to scientific debate.  Should we have affirmitve action for planets that are farthest from us in the solar system?  Clearly science(a field of facts and figures) must be racialized and racial debate ignited so that we can prove we all once had African pigmintation in our skin, something that neither matters nor has any relevance on anything(including the bible).<br />This book is a waste of time, totally unsatisfying and not academically important.	2003-09-15

We sturck back quickly, whipping recalcitrant nations to our side, like Pakistan, and toppling the Taliban in Afghanistan with the help of the N. Alliance.  Soon after the Bush admin racheted up the rhetoric against Iraq.  This book makes the (not startling or new) argument that the war on terror(a rieghtous war in whcih we confront a new enemy worse then communism) was 'Hijacked' by Bush's oil policy.  Kets get this strait, we have already heard the accusations about Bush's invasion of Iraq.<br />1) Bush wants for revenge becaused Saddam tried to kill his dad.<br />2) Bush wants to give the American public something to watch on TV, rather then falling stocks(he learned this from CLinton who bombed Iraq duing Liwinsky).<br />3)  Bush wants Iraqs oil.<br />4)  The armed forces have nothing better to do and Bush wants to kill some more Muslim kids(since he coulndt kill enough civilians in Afghanistan).<br />These spurious claims are now presented in a new format.  This book purports itself to be solidly behind the war on terror but feels bush hasnt been strong enough in pursuing it.  Case in point(so goes the argument) is Saudi.  Saudis made up most of the hijackers on 9/11 and Saudi finances most of global terror and of course Al-Quaeda is headed by a Saudi.  We all know Saudi is a threat to the world(at least now we are waking up to this fact) and that Suadi pretends to be our friend while financing attacks on us.<br />This book is in line with the argument that we arnt doing enough to combat global terror.  Now this is probably true, in order to truly confront global terror we need to invade Pakistan, Saudi, the West Bank, Syria and maybe a few more nations(including France too).  Now this just isnt possible.  Bush's war in Iraq was founght not only to make a peaceful Iraq that will be a loyal oil supplier, but also to rid Suadi of our troops so that Bin laden can no longer claim we are occupying the holy land.  Once Iraqs oil is up and running we can wean ourselves of Suadi oil and then we can topple the saudi regime or terror sponsoring.  The author just doenst understand that these long term goals will take time.  We destroyed the immediate training ground: Afghanistan.  Now having taken Iraq the terrorists are coming to us and our soldiers are dying, but thats preferable to having the terrorists attacking our civilians here.<br />THis books conclusions are incorrect.  While it is true the Bush regime is pro oil it is not truee that Bush sold us out to get oil, he is merely making long term strategy.e Iraqs oil is up and running we can wean ourselves of Suadi oil and then we can topple the saudi regime or terror sponsoring.

The author exclames that he will weave the tale of a number of men living in the land.  A christian businessman from the city(whose business is ruined by the terrorism and military occupation), a Palistinian murder(who yearns to kill israeli civilians but gets stuck in the siege), and a Jewish soldier(who is nice and conflicted about his role, which suits the anti-Israeli press). <br />This short volume portrays the deterioration of life in the Bethlehem and the lead up to the final siege of the Church.  The author does a great job whitewashing the terrorists, who are portrayed as honorable fighters defending thier homeland(apparently its neccesary to murder Israeli civilians to accomplish this very noble goal).  The author also does a great job justifying the occupation of a holy christian place by viscious terrorists and then treats the Israelis as goliath like monsters who 'dare' to lay siege to the chruch.  Clearly the author felt the israels should have allowed the terrorists to do as they pleased after murdering civilians.<br />The irony and hypocrisy in this book is clearly evident.  The author acknowledges that the 'cause' of the Intifada was the visit of Sharon to the Muslim Holy place(the temple mount).   Its interesting then that the same author finds it totally exceptable that terrorists should occupy a christian holy place with their weapons.  All Sharon did was tour the temple mount, he never entered the Mosques, yet thats viscious and unexceptable to  newsweek while the occupation of one of the holy christian churches in the world by Muslims is a neccesary act so that they wont be jailed.  Can we imagine the insanity Muslims would delve into were a single Jew to dare to enter a mosque on the Temple mount?<br />This is a book typical of the anti-israel lobby at Newsweek, and a book that is full ofbias and scaterlogical writing style, doing no justice to the profound events it covers.	2003-09-15

The state departmentr lets us down every day and supports the most un american regimes in the world.  The state department supported the barbaric turks in thier invasion of Cyprus.  State looked on as Allende was toppled.  Recently State supports Pakistan and Saudi, two regimes that helped create terrorism in Afghanistan and two places that fun terrorism the world over.  Yet this book does not understand the tenents of realism.<br />It would be nice if we could invade Suadi and crush these despots who funfd billions towards our destruction and who made up the majority of the 9/11 attackers.  But its not that easy.  We need the Saudis for a few more years as we establish our oil power in Iraq.  Onc e our troops are safe in Iraq we can take out the Saudis because we will have a new ally in the Gulf.  America has always had an ally in the Gulf.  We had the Shah in the 70s(when the Suadis created the oil embargo), in the 80s we had saddam because he helped us get back at the Iranian revolution, and in the 90s we had Saudi, because Iraq and Iran were controlled by anti americans who had grown too big for thier britches.  Now we will have Iraq again and we can rid ourselves of the distateful Saudis once and for all.  The State department is full of Kissinger-like realists and we need to try and understand some of its actions before judging it harshly the way this book does, taking no account of the fact that what one sees on the surface(support of Saudi) may not be the case.	2003-09-15

One is called 'Crude Politics\\" and another deals with the State departments betrayal of america.  But the reality is different.  This book attempts to that we are not confronting Saudi because of oil.<br />This is partly true.  We need oil.  Thats why we invaded Iraq so that a friendly Iraqi regime will supply us with oil so we can rid ourselves of the barbaric Saudis<br />The book examines a number of points:<br />1) Most of the terrorists on Sept 11th were Saudi<br />2) Saudis fund most religious schools in Afghanistan that provided fodder for the terrorists.  Saudis also secretly fun most fandamentalist terror organizations.<br />3) Our cantacts with the Saudis, who the government says are our allies and who we are dependent on for oil, have hindered the war on terror by not allowing us to confront them.<br />4)  The Saudis are a barbaric rtegime that supports worldwide terror and funds anti americanism and yet we turn a blind eye to this.<br />Apparently realism prevents us from invading Saudi.But rest your emotions, the Saudis will get thiers and they will be hung in the town square and shot down in foriegn lands by our agents, its only a matter of time.	2003-09-15

For many years I have been digesting books on Islam.  I read the Koran(an english version of course) and I read 'The Rage and the Pride' and 'In the Path of God Islam and Political Power' and 'What went wrong' and many other books discussing the political/religious offensive against American and the world. But this book was sadly lacking.<br />The author wants to show us how Islamic Jihad has entered a new phase and how the attack on america was an inevitabloe extension of islams 1500 year holy war against the world.  Well the author tries to illuminate the passages in the Koran that exhort Islamic soldiers to assault the infidels world.  Then the author shows how Jihad is practiced all  over the world today(from Kashmir to the phillipines to the Sudan).  Then the author shows us how Islam has infiltrated Europe and America through organizations like CAIR(an islamofascist group that says it wants to help us understand the 'peaceful' religion).<br />The book is right on the mark but the authors organization is weak and so is the text as well as the historical info.  The author cites some of Islams current holy wars but leaves out key places like Nigeria.  I recommend both of Daniel Pipes books \\"Militant Islam reaches America\\" and \\"In the Path of God\\" his books are organized more logically and draw attention to similar themese of Islamic assault on the west.<br />This book had potential but its author let us down.  Its true that Islam is as great a threat today as Fascism was in 1939 and Communism in 1950, but this book is simply not academically resilient.	2003-09-15

I reccomend Harts &quot;Arafat&quot; and Aburishs 'Arafat' above this.  This book tries to paint a picture of Arafat as a great legitimate political leader.  But this book does not show the whoel picture.  It makes Arafat out to be more then a terrorist and does nto weigh the effort that he was a viscious murdered of children(which he was for most of his life).  THis book does take into account his many twists and turns but it probably gives Arafat too much credit and is not as interesting as other works on the man.	2003-09-15

Books	4	1	1	N	N	interesting, insightful	This book tells the stories of Europe's Jewish diaspora from 1492-1967 in a series of portraits of the communities.  From Venice to Amsterdam to Spain to Russia and Vilna among others are given a slice of life/slice of time of these amazing and enduring Jews.  We learn of a Jewish ghetto where the Jews are shut in every night(for their protection).  We also learn of the open Amsterdam ghetto where Jews lived like equals and prospered.  We learn fo the great Jewish communities of Spain that were crushed in 1492, including the land of Maimonidies.  We learn of the Vilna ghetto and Abba Kovners partisans who fought to take revenge for the destruction of the Jeursalum on the Baltic.  We also learn of the Russian Jews of 1967 who yearned to return to their land of Israel after the Six day war.<br />This is a wonderful book that explores many people and many cultures and sheds a light on the events of the Diaspora in Europe.<br />A must read.	2003-09-15

Both men seemed off to a good start, one in the war and as an artist and the other in the seminary.  Yet other issues dominated the childhood of these men that forced them into extremist polituics and eventually led them to mass murder.  Both were phenomenal politicians and able to lure their own collaborators to their doom.  An interesting way to present these two, by comparing and contrasting these similar lives that led too very different outcomes.<br />Now the writing itself is commendable and so are the parralells.  But the author should have written two biographies.  The only redemption this book has is that it shows how right wing facism is exactly the same as left wing liberalism(Communbism to be exact in this case).  Stalin and Hitler allthough they prported themselves to be on diffrent wings of the political spectrum were both monsters who crushed minorities and enslaved their own people.  They became allies in 1939 and the world shuddered with what these beasts could accomplish together, luckily for all of us Stalin and Hitler wasted the enslaved masses of their nations destorying eachother.  All the better for the Americans to pick up the pieces.<br />I would recommend Conquests' \\"Stalin breaker of Nations\\" and Kershaws two volume work on Hitler \\"Hubris\\" and \\"Nemisis\\".	2003-09-14

Kennedy, 1917-1963	Books	1	10	122	N	N	Another Kennedy lover loose on American shelves	Another useless Kennedy loving book has been loosed on us and I want to show you how useless this book is.  Thier must be 50 books on JFK.  This book now tops the pile, sopposedly exploring new evidence(how much new evidence can their be, arnt we waiting for the CIA to admit they killed him?) and sopposedly explodes the myth that kennedy wanted to expland the war in Nam.  NOw lets not fall off our chairs, Kennery was a warlike person, a hater of the communists, your telling me he got cold feat and then suddenly died.  No.<br />JFKs life wasnt 'unfinished' as this biogrpahy claimed.  It was finished.  And it was finished apparently by a man who was a big communist lover, who also was invovled with anti castro right wing groups and apparently was involved with the mob(also anti castro) and the CIA(which was also anti castro), but wanted to kill kennedy becasue Kennedy wanted to kill castro.  So Kennedys life is finished.  And its for the best.  Kennedy was a monstrous man, cheating on his wife, using drugs, prostitutes, abusing women, lying, having sex with the same woman his brother was, destroying the CIA while putting america into wars half a world away.  Nothing was unfinished unless you wanted Kennedy to finish his term so he could be involved in more wrongdoing and chicanery.<br />This is a useless biography, something that deserves to be put onto the used bookstore shelf along with the over 50000 books on JFK.	2003-09-14

None of us remmmeber what happaned at Famagusta.  The Muslims were sieging the city and the indegenous CHristians were praying to god to help them.  Then the Muslims lured the christian leader out under flag of truce.  In front of the city the muslims cut his skin off him and stuffed it with hay, he was still alive to see his skin hanging on a dummy body.  THis is typical 'peaceful' muslim behavior of course but what one forgets is that even with the ottoman victory the christians lived on, and currently occupy half of Cyrpus.  THis would not have been the case had Kissinger and the Viscious intolerant anti-minority Tirks had their way(remmember what the turks and other 'peaceful' muslims did to the armenians?).  Hitchens tells the story of Cyrpus as it happaned.  How the Greek Cypriots were betrayed and how the machinations of foriegn powers brought the island to civil strife and finally turkish invasion.  WIth the Turkish invasion the christians were forced to flee or be massacred, but of course like most population exchanges the only people that had to leave were the non muslims, the muslims in christian cyprus stayed put because western powers are always more benevolent(remmember what happened with India/Pakistan in 1948 how all the hindu/sihks were massacred in Pakistan but westerners get mad when one muslim dies in India).  Hitchens book is an important work and not biased, it does focus to much on foriengers and does not talk about the day to day violence that overtook Cyprus prior to the invasion.	2003-09-14

This book details the international cold war aspect of the war.  It compiles good information about the respective militaries involved in the conflict and gives briefs on man yof the key Israeli and Arab actors.  The most intriguing aspect of this read is its focus on the air left which it claims 'Saved Israel'.  I've known American volunteers who went to Israel and helped unload the planes so the arms could be brought to the front as quickly as possible.  The reader must decide how central a role the air lift played in the outcome of the war.  The authors knowledge of military hardware is extensive and insightful.  This book does not have the personal feel that Harzogs 'War of Atonement' does, nor is this book an in dept study of the military strategy and thoughts prior to and during the war.  The author does touch on the controversial subject of Israels nuclear program and the questionable application of it.<br />Probably that is the most interesting new knowledge brought to fore in this book is its emphasis on the 'brink' of nuclear war between the super powers, something that other authors including Sharon and Adan have not discussed in thier respective autobiographies that detail the conflict.<br />this book is worth a read.	2003-09-14

It provides an excellent introduction that has real transcripts from the Israeli fortification the Suez and the radio contacts with HQ as they were overun and sourounded.  This gives the reader the feeling of uter collapse that the Israeli army found itsefl in when Egyptian and Syrian units rolled over them in the first day of the war.<br />Yet the book goes on to detail the ensuing U.N machination, the historical buildup, the palistinian problem, the intentions of the 10 nations at war(this includes the arab contingents sent to fight in the war). The book details the 'brink' of nuclear war between the super powers and the subesquent airlifts.<br />In the end the Israeli army routed the Syrian and Egyptian armies and came within miles of Damascus and Cairo, encircling an entie egyptian army on the east side of the canal.  The book has many drawbacks.  It does not credit Mr. Sharon witht he credit he is clearly due for his hard hatted efforts to breakthrough and take the initiative while other isreali counteroffensives were crushed.  THis book also is typically biased as the english press always is, towards the palistinians, who had nothing whatsoever to do with this war.  In fact the war was fought by Sadat so that he could later sign a peace with israel and get rid of the russians so he could ally him self witht he americans(liek King Hussien had done).  Sadat allowed his Syrian ally to be crushed while his soldier sstopped only miles from the canal, waiting under thier SAM missle shield.<br />Other books on the subject might be helpful in filling the gaps.  Notably Sharons 'Warrior', Harzogs 'War of atonement' and Boynes 'Two O' Clock war'.  For details fot he israeli counterattack on the Sinai one can read Aden(Bren)'s account of the war.	2003-09-14

He says Cochise was a true chief of his people, a noble warrior.  He says of Geronomo that he was not a chief, just a vengeful leader of small band.  Cochise was a political and military leader who cared for his entire people for many years, fighting to keep them independent and finally dying alone, free in the Dragoon maountains of Arizona.  The Apache lived in a savage, inhospitable desert, a no mans land, no food, no water, but these amazing people lived up in these mountains and for more then a hundred years were a nemesis to indians and Anglos and Mexicans alike.  Cochise led his men in battle against the americans only a few times.  Mostly he negotiated with the soldiers at Fort Bowie(today you must walk a wonderful short trail to see this post).  Sweeney has written this and a book on Mangas of the New Mexico Apache tribes.<br />This book os so thorough so well written and so unflawed in its great depth of study of the experiences of Apache in Arizona and Mexico and slowly theyw ere driven from thier way of life.<br />This is a must read, superior to any biography of similar Native American characters.	2003-09-14

In the 20th century a series of ideological political thought systems came to the fore that tried to offer man salvation(since man had found no salvation in god for more then 2000 years and was tired of waiting).  Socialism and its brother communism and fascism uised the new weapons and mass media of the day to crush humanity into slavery.  Orwell first witnissed this in Spain when he saw Fascism confront COmmunism and seven Anarchism on the battlefield.<br />Orwells books Anamial Farm and 1984 show us a bleak world in which idealists control our daily lives and force us to do what we are told or risk death and imprisonedment(alla Stalinism).  In some ways we must fear this as the future.  With technology and weapons as powerful as they are the chances of us all becoming slaves to a dictatoprial government that wants us tot hink and act a certain way is ever present.  Orwell came to understand the evils of communism(he had been a big slinging socialism when younger).  Orwell, having died young, saw through a lens of humanity and pored into his few works the conscience of the 20th century.<br />This is a good read and this book renews our interest in orwell after so many years of his virtual eclipse.	2003-09-14

Harts 'Arafat Terrorist or peacemaker', Aburish 'Arafat from defender to dictator' a book called 'Arafat in the eye of the beholder' and then another book just released named 'Arafat'.  This book seems to take most of his life into account.  From his days in Kuwait and Cairo  to the most recent time with Abbas as PM.  Unfortuantly the conclusion is flawed.  Abbas has quit and Arafat has all the riens of power.  The conclusion that his many mistakes are going to eclipse him finally is wrong.  Arafat is still loved by his people.<br />The book is unbiased, which is nice from other works on Arafat.  Unforutnatly the book doesnt fault him for supporting murder of children(but I guess we forgave Begin so we can forgive Arafat).  The books view that Arafat has caused much suffering for his own people because of his military mismanagement is right on the mark.<br />This is an important update on Arafats life, the other bios of him are dated.	2003-09-14

Hitchens who used to be a good little liberal, has finally seen the truht behind the new liberal value system, anmely that they will do whatever it takes to have power, sort of like Hitler and Stalin.  Hitchens, who loves Orwell, has seen the pigs and knows that Clinton is no better then the dictators of Soviet russia.  The Clintons took this country into the gutter, and forieghn countries loved it.  Now liberals are whining that the world hates us.  Wait, you mean blessed France and lovable China and the cute Iranians hate us, oh no.  You cna judge us by our enemies, hitler hated us to, should we be worried?  The CLintons and their followers made everyone laugh at us.  Here they were renting out the white house, lying about what they had to drink at funraising events, lying about big things and little things, as if they just coulndt turn the lie switch off.<br />They had no shame and Mr. Hitchens shows the havoc they reaked.

Its about the size of half a deck of cards, and far less discerning.  Hitchens should develop this into a real book, but he suffers from jurnalists disease(writing short stories and publishing them as real books when they should be sold as a Zean on the street by kids).  Beyond the faults, if you can find this book its worth a thumb through for the fact that Hitchens shows the fallacy of the left liberal argument that the war in Iraq was a mistake.  Lets analyze his points:<br />1) Saddam is a viscious dictator, he murdered hundreds of thousands of 'peaceful' muslims.  The left loves Saddam.  But the left also loves the same people he rounded up and shot in the swamps of iraq(these people are mostly terrorists and fundamentalists).  The left seems to love everyone in iraq, no matter how viscious and brutal.  Our war will make Iraq more peacefull.<br />2)  THey call this a war for oil.  At the same time that Liberals want us to wean ourselves of Saudi oilt they wont let us drill in Alaska or find oil in other muslim states.  Well Iraq has oil, but if we buy it from saddam he will build bombs, so we took out saddam and now we get the oil and we leave Saudi, so our troops will no longer be on muslim 'peaceful' holy land.<br />3) Liberals say some kids will die in our attack.  Daily saddam steals the 'oil for food' money and builds weapons and gives the money to his military.  Saddam murders kids daily but somehow the fact that we might have to kill a few to save them all is wrong.<br />Hitchens explodes the myths of the anti war movement showing the fallacies in an off the cuff, seat of th epants dieary like format, an interesting book.	2003-09-14

Liberals say Hitchens is a liar, I say this is a must read.  Orwell was a good communist, he had the dream in his heart for a better world.  Like some sort of phantom Bobby Kennedy he saw the way the world could be and asked 'why not'.  Orwell then watched as COmmunism became a viscious hideos monstrosity.  Everywhere communism went it became more brutal then what it was replacing.  In RUssia the communists took peasants(who had simply been suppressed under the Tsar) and murdered millions of them for no reason whatsoever.  Orwell eventually migrated his views and wrote 'Animal Farm' thus opening the glass on the evils of totalitarian leadership and the blind ideals of the foolish followers Orwell matters because he opened his mind and stopped following a false ideology, an ideology that became as bad as fascism.  Hitchens is a great writer and wonderful poetic author.	2003-09-14

He takes on all manner of people while not focusing on the true hypcrisy in the leftist love of the hate for america found in Islam.<br />Morris wrote this to capitalize on the sudden resurgence in conservative poplar literature and to capitalize on the money he could make by saying we should &quot;off the heads&quot; of the traitors.  Coulters &quot;Treason&quot; is superior and so is &quot;In the path of god&quot; Islam and political power.<br />This book is not helpful.

This book and others like it('Harvest of Sorrow' by Conquest and 'Gulag' by Applebaum) describe the terrible pain and suffering and outright genocide that was perpetrated against the Ukrainians by Stalins Russia.  This began with the collectivization of the farms.  Then the Kulaks, who Stalin called capitalists because most owned one or two more chickens then their neighboors, were all shipped to Siberia.  What followed next was the confiscation of the grain from the farmers and the starvation of millions.<br />This book details the tragedy.  It is a good accounting of this very hidden history, unknown to the west until years later.  In fact many western jurnalists were duped into beleiving Stalin had created a 'maricle' in the Ukraine.  THe only miracle was the disappearence of millions of people, whose only crime was that they were peasents.	2003-09-14

I disagree.  Why is it that americas heroes today are only the soldiers of ours that have been captured?  When did heroism come to mean \\"i got captured and I survived\\".  John  Mccain also a hero.  Well it seems to me that America is cought in a psychosis and this book is at the forefront.  The romans didnt admire those that were captured, they admired those that won battles.  We used to admire the winners, like Patton and Macarthur and Grant.  The British used to admire the men who fought to the death, paying the ultimate price.  We admired men like that, John Paul Vann, Custer, Nathan Hale.<br />Now I dont want poeple to think I'm slandering Mr. Durant. He's very brave and served his country.  I jsut find it a little sickening, a little depressing that men died so that he could be captured.  Now the optimist says 'well thats the point' but I am more pessimistic, Gordon and shulbert fought to the death, why couldnt Durant?  Why couldnt Lynch.  Lynch is getting paid some ungodly amount for her srory and all she did was pass out while her comrades fought bravely to the end.  Whats heroic about Lynch?  Nothing in my opinion.  Something is Heroic about the men who died trying to defend her though(wheres the book on them?).  I might be wrong. This was an exciting read, very well written and interesting.  Black Hawk Down is better because it shows the whole story.	2003-09-14

Hitchens claims Kissinger was involved in lots of cold war scullduggery.  He claims the Nixon admin convinced the S. Vietnamese to break off peace talks in 68' thus prolonging the war.  Well thats cute, the vietnamese couldnt think for themselves???  COulndt south vietnam make a choice.  If the south had really wnated peace they could ahve ahd it but they choose to stay with us and keep fighting.  Well tthe Nixon admin didnt want to lose the south just yet(it fell in 75').  Then Hitchens says that Kissinger conspired to have Allende thrown out.  Well whats wrong with that.  Allende stole american property so we supported his enemies.  Thats the way realism(and Kissinger was a realist) works.  If your neighboor steals from you and a bully comes along and says 'Ill take care of him' then you say sure 'ill look the other way'.  Well we looked the other way when allende died fighting in the presidential palace.<br />Hitchens accuses Kissinger of other skullduggery, namely cyprus.  Well once again realism triumphed.  AMerica needed Turkey to put allow our missles in it to fight the communists and we needed them as a friendly muslim state.  Well we didnt need the Greek Cypriots for anything excpet the british liked them.  So we let the Turks invade and then kept them at a line dividing the island.<br />So how can we accuse kissinger of doing anything but acting in americas self interest.  Yes he was tough, but thats the way the world is.	2003-09-14

He tries to look at the Ottomans as an example.  Lewis seems to miss the boat on this one.  Islam first invaded Christendom in the 7th century and by 732 was at the gates of Paris.  From this period it was pushed back in spain until it was driven out in 1492.  Now Islam recovered quickly, having dealt with the crusaders it blossomed in Turkey.  The Ottomans were the first to use Cannon in Europe when they crushed the Byzantines and flooded into eastern Europe.  Now 'What Went Wrong'? tries to answer why it is that Islam, so advanced, having 'invented' the number 0 and having 'preserved' the works of Plato and Ptolemy, why this religion of 'Peace' suddenly declined after the 17th century, recieving one military disaster after another from the hands of the Eropeans(who had been so backward only 500 years before in the eyes of Islam).  Lewis tries to show how the Turks confronted these dilemmas with legal reform and tried to 'modernize' themselves.  Unfortunatly the only modernization the turks got was learning genocide against the Armenians and then becoming secular under Attatuck.  Lewis has tackled the wrong country and drawn the wrong conclucions from this short study.  What went wrong?  Why did Islam, once so advanced, become so backward and retract itself to acting the way it did in the 7th century.  Why does Sadui look more like it did in the 600s then it looks like modern day New York?  Lewis doenst confront this dilemma.  He doesnt confont the question of why Europeans nations were able tos eperate church and state(although bloodily) while Islam remained entrenched in state sponsored religion.<br />The reality is that Lewis did not do an expansive study of this phenomenon.  For the same reason that the Chinese rejected British imperial civilization only to adapt another western concept: communism, can we understand why Islamic countries have also saddled themselves between the secularism of Attaturk and the fundamentalism of the Taliban.  Maybe 50 years ago when Socialist Ba'ath parties and nationlists like Nasser and secularists like the Shah and Attaturks succesors where in charge we would have been acxking ourselves 'Why is islam so leftist?'  Lewis simply doesnt understand that countries like Suadi and Afganistan that have chosen to stay in the 7th century are simply backward totalitarian states trying to keep a small group of wealthy men in power, its no different then Stalin, and we should only view it as being 'wrong' in the send that we should want these countries to be democratic.  Islam and democracy are compatible and modernization ios compatible, in America we modernized the savage repressive deep south, how is it any different to civilize the Saudis?  It just takes time, money, and some killing.<br />Lewis's book is an interesting study, perhaps more relevant for those interested in Ottoman interpretations of western advance.ization only to adapt another western concept: communism, can we understand why Islamic countries have also saddled themselves between the secularism of Attaturk and the fundamentalism of the Taliban.

For many it was a trauma, when the undefeated IDF and IAF seemed impotent to arab aggression.  For Egypt it marked the popular triumph over thier hated enemy.  Harzog, former president of Israel, was on hand to be an eyewitness as the events unfolded.  THis is his study of the conflict.  It is throrough and he gives an unbiased account of the many israeli actors who fought the war, men like generals Aden and Sharon and the prime minister Golda.  The downside of the book is that it appears to emphasize the Syrian front far to much.  The Syrian offensive, like the Egyption one, took the ISraelis by suprise when it was not defeated in the first day.  But the Syrian front was not, in my opinion, the most important theater of the conflict.  THe large egyptian army(we must remmember Egypt and Nasser had been ISraels principal antagonist since 1948) and the fighting near the suez was the most important and where the war was decided(when Sharon brilliantly crossed the canal and encircled the Egyption third army).  So this is a fair account of the war, their are other books.  Aden(Bren) wrote a book about his experiences in the Sinai, as well as Sharons 'Warrior'(autobiography) and the book 'Two of Clock war' appears to be well written although not lenghty.  Their is also at least one other book entitled 'the Yom Kippur War' that is a very professional, although critical of Sharon, account of the war.	2003-09-14

Now we all know Stalin to be such a towering personality and this book just doesnt cut the meat on him.  I suggest that when availible you should pick up Volkogonov's \\"Stalin Triumph and Tragedy\\" and also Conquests' \\"Stalin: Breaker of Nations\\". Nevertheless Radzinsky(a russian Jew descendent) sheds light on the evils of Stalins terror machine and Stlins rise to power in the 20s.  Unfortunatly it shies away fromt he horror of the Ukrainian famine and the mass movement of minority populations that were crushed by Stalin(a Georgian himself).  THis book does nto shed enough light on the Gulags and the virtual citiies of penal colonies the government created to build projects like the White Sea Canal.  This book wears a tad thin on its coverage of Stalins total blindness to the coming German war and the reaction of Stalin to the war(he offered to resign).  Not enough attention is given to the 'Doctors plot' and the coming repression of the Jews of Russia.  Nevertheless in the panthion of acadmeic studies of Stalin this book is a decent investigation.	2003-09-14

Now maybe I'm not a genious but I'm only 24 and I've never met a nazi and I dont think I've ever seen one.  But I have met militant blacks who hate whites, and militant native americans who hate whites, and militant Mexicans(Mecha) who hate whites and blacks, and even militant Jews(not to ignore the militant muslims who hate all us infidels).  Now maybe I'm crazy but i dont see a hundred little hitlers, I see a few wacko youth who are lost and have become fascists because they need an ideology and the youth of today are floating aimlessly with no movement to be invovled in and no war to shipped off to.  The fact that these stupid fascist wanna bees ran into a few african immigrants and were drunk and killed one is just bad luck.  Somehow the murder of Mathew sheppard and the murder of the man who was dragged to death in Texas gets lot sof media attention but disproportionate to the reality.  Im a Jew and I've never been worried when I walk down the steet(even if I'm sportin a Kipa(Yarmluke))that some nazi youth might jump from a jeep and take their jack boots to my circumsized manhood(of course they might be disuaded by the Ar-15 I keep loaded in my closet) from invading my house.  I'm much more concerned that I'll be the victim of gang violence or have some 'peaceful' muslims yell 'Heeb' as they drive by.<br />I think Ms. Langor should focus her attention on the other viscious youth movements(like urban minotiry youth) who are more violent and far more numerous then the reputed 100 hitlers living in america.  Maybe Langers correct then(face value), there are only about 100 nazi youth in this country that we should be legitimatly scared of.  How many bloods and crypts are there? 1000s probably, im more worried about them.	2003-09-14

This book, as far as I know, is the only one that explores the fascinating history of the Cherokees after they reached Oklohoma.  We all know of the 'trail of tears' where the cherokees were removed from Georgia and forced to march to Oklohoma.  This book tells the great story of their attempts ot civilize the land.  How they built homes how they bought slaves and how they fought with neighbooring indians(who looked like savages to the new americanized Cherokee).  The Cherokees fought in the civil war and even fought civil wars among themselves.  This book details the hatred of the pure blood cherokees for their brethen who seemed more white and scottish then the others.  The cherokee nation then was oborbed into the state of oklohoma when the Indian territory was aboloshed.  This is an extraordinary tail of a hitherto unknown american story about one of americas most talked about, but seldom understood and studied, indian tribes, the noble civilized cultured Cherokee(who so many people claim to be descended from that a modern Indian joke goes &quot;what do you get when you have 40 Cherokees in one room?

Mr Aburish, who also wrote a book on Arafat and one on Saddam, details the growth of the house of Saud and its royal family.  How it transformed a desert kingdom into a thriving middle eastern power.  How it confronted Arab nationism and how it has now come to suppress its own people. Unfortunatly the book does not detail the support of terrorism and the suppression of women and foriegners(who do all the work since Saudis cant seem to learn how to drill their own oil).  THis book talks about arabs from an arab point of view and is indispensible int he understanding of the Saudi mindset.

How did it happen?  THe author explains in detail how the CLinton administration bent over backwards not to offend the 'peacefull' religion of Islam and did nothing to stop Bin Laden.  Terrorists understand only strength.  Clinton and his boys were to busy doing other things to notice that Bin Laden was being allowed to get away with unspeakable crimes, much like [Germany] in the 30s.  It is no wonder terror finally hit us so hard when we did so little to prevent its unleashment.  This book takes us behind the scenes in Yemen to understand the Cole bombing and shows us the foolish military policy that had us bombing the Sudan while thousands of terrorists were training in Afghanistan.  This book explains how a weak administration with a weak foreign policy can allow our country to become so open to attack.  Its clear that Bin Laden saw our weakness, our openness as he was allowed to hit us from the shores of SOmalia, tot he mountains of Kenya, to the cities of Saudi and finally our own backyard.  Its not like Bin Laden didnt warn us, Like [Germany] with Kampf, Bin Laden told the world he would 'declare war on the United States' and the CLintons sat back laughing and must have been thinking \\"these savage muslims cant possible hit us here in this socialist paradise we are building\\".  Well the book explains what happened, pick up a copy.  And for all of you Clinton lovers, the author is not a clinton hater he is merely explaining how we dropped the ball, a republican might have done the same.	2003-09-11

This is not a story of the everyday man in Cuba(although we do learn that he suffered much economically). This is not an economic history of Castro's Cuba(Although we learn how much the economy declined and sugar production as well). This is the story of Castro's foreign flings and the cult of personality around him. We learn of Castro's invasions of a dozen countries in Africa, from Angola to the Congo. We learn equally of Castro's associations with his Latin American compatriots and his attempts to invade and infiltrate most of his neighbors. Those that love Castro and believe he created a socialist paradise in Cuba will not be happy with this book. Equally those wanting to learn the gruesome details of the many suppressed by Castro will also not be happy. This is a fair portrait of this larger then life Guerilla and the wrath he has brought upon the world. This is not a negative book that condemns Castro, in fact I find myself admiring him more after reading it. What one does have to ask themselves if they are an admirer of Castro is if he is truly loved by his people why are their no free elections? Why are other political parties outlawed in Cuba? Why are only government sponsored newspapers allowed? If Castro's socialism was such a paradise then why not let his own people write what they think of it, and say what they think, why murder your political rivals? Or banish them? It is so obvious that communism and all it brings is slavery to its own people, Cuba is a great example and this book tells all about Castro. The author could have done away with the investigation of the Kennedy murder because she reveals nothing new but pollutes many pages with theories.	2003-09-09

It purports itself to be a jurnalistic account of the Lebanese Civil war and the Israeli situation in Jerusalem. Unfortunatly the book consists of half and half reporting and cute little stories.  We learn about the bombing of the jurnalists own house and we learn about the newsrooms of Beirut.  While we should celebrate the authors guts in covering these viscious times it seems to me the reading was light and weak.  More a travel jurnal then what I expected.  The book, like everything on Lebanon, is biased, it takes the side of the palistinians brushing over their savagry in ruining a nice country while critisizing the christians for daring to defend themselves.  It critisizes the Israelis  for 'indiscriminate' shelling and says nothing fo the palistinians indiscriminate shalling that also ruines lives.  The chapters on Israel are insteresting as an American Jews critique of the Jewish state, but most of the observations are repugnant.  This idea that israel is some vast memorial to the holocaust, some remnant, is a revulting notion and it seems one elucidated by the author, he does not seem to understand the greatness of israel as the only country where free speech and free religion exist in the middle east, as well as democracy.	2003-09-05

Its sad a book like this needs to be written because its so obvious that Israel is a Reigtous democracy.  If you have a region somewhere and their are ten countries. And all but one country is a dictatorship and all but one country it is dangerous if you are a minority, especially a relgiious minority.  In all but one country the people are univserally poor except for a few wealthy families.  In all but one country women and gays are discriminated against.  In all but one country the press is owned by the government or censored.  In all but one country people may not protest without risk of being shot.  Now which country would you support, the nine that are dictatorships with kings and elite fmailies where minorities and freedoms are crushed or in the one democracy?  Well according to professors on our campuses these dictatorships are great and the democracy is bad.  This is the lie about israel.  Dershowitz shows how the media lies about Israel.  He shows how lies distort the history of israel and how the media wants us to think that the nice terrorists are the true victims.  Dershowitz finally takes the media and left to task for their antisemitism and their lies about what Israel is really all about.  I hope all the leftist lesbians who hate Israel go to a place like Saudi and then tell me its better then  Israel, oh wait they wont be able to tell me because they will be stoned to death and forced into a burqua and not allowed to drive or speak.  HMMMM, which country is better.	2003-09-05

Unfortunatly much of it is the authors recollections.  Now this does not discount the books greatness. The story is one of heroism and triumph over great odds. The Israelis built one of the best air forces int he world.  An air force that able to defeat the arabs many times and proved in one on one combat to be far superior.  Some detractors say this was simply because the 'American' weapon system was better, thats like a workmen blaming his tools, which is typical of the arab mindset, if they lose they always blame some plot that brought them failure, instead of crediting their opponents resolutness.  Furthermore the Israeli air force was able to slip into entebbe and rescue Jewish hostages, something the americans failed to do in 1979 in the Desert One failure.  On top of this the Israelis were able to airlift tens of thousands of jews from Iraq, Ethiopia and the Yemen.	2003-09-05

No other book deals with the entire Lebanese Civil war from 1975-1989.  Other books like 'From Beirut to Jerusalum' and 'Israels Lebanon War' deal with segments of the conflict.  This is an important work and all the more so because of Mr. Fisks first hand accounts.<br />Unfortunatly like all the other books on the mideast this book does contain bias and hypocrisy.  Once again Mr. Fisk whines about the hardship of the palistinians.  We must understand that Mr. Fisk, like all Jurnalists covering the civil war, was taken in by the Palistinian propoganda machine.  Mr. FIsk does not level the same criticism at the Syrians that he does of the Israels when both of these countries where involved in similar incidents in the Lebanon.  Mr. Fisk like so many biased authors also overlooks the virtual ethnic cleansing of the christians of Lebanon. But for these flaws this book is far less biased and sugarcoats the Palistinians far less then many similar works.  I truly recommend this read to anyone who can stumach the 700 pages.	2003-08-31

It touches on the many aspects of Italian life, the rise of the middle class, the shift towards mediteranianism, the triumph of Christian Democracy, and the love of sport(football).  This book also touches on the love hate mentality that Italians have for Americans, they love our protection but love to hate the USA. This is a short narrative, it perhaps does not touch on the more important events that are shaping Italy today.  The mafia, the red terrorists, the elections of 1992, the corruption, the craxi regime, the invasion of immigrants and the plight of the south.  Perhaps the book needs to be longer, it should be recommended as a short concise read on Italy for those taking a survey course or those interested in the current state.	2003-07-23

While Wiezman was tinkering in Washington and Ben-Gurion was debating with England small bands of Jewish youth were striking fear into the hearts of the british soldiers in Palistine.  Terror our of Zion focuses on the Stern gang and the Irgun and thier triumphs and tragedies.  It focuses on thier leaders Avraham Stern and Manachem Begin.  The book also focuses on the near civil war that took place between the Haganah and these terrorist groups.  In many ways these groups were the forfathers of the now illegal Kach movement.  These groups in some ways predicted the birth of Mr. Goldstien who slaughtered the Arabs at prayer in the 90s in retaliation for Arab attacks on innocent Jews.  THese terror gorups also created two Israeli prime ministers, Begin and Shamir, both of whom have had a formative influence on modern Israel.  This is a worthwhile read and the only study of its kind on these essential groups.	2003-07-17

Yet he has been forgotten.  He has been relegated to the trash bin so that leaders like Mr. Netanyahoo and Mr. Begin can have the limelight(should I include Sharon).  This is his story, told in his words.  Few books on Israel detail the reign of Shamir and even fewer seem to judge him in a fair light. A founder of the Israeli republic, he should not be forgotten.  This book talks about his ideas and his many struggles.  But alas, the book also has weakness in that it does not describe all th events that took place under his premiership.  He descibes more the scandals then the positions he stood for.  Mostly this is due to the fact that this book was written soon after his retirement and he felt the reader would be familiar with his struggles, but 20 years later we are not familiar.	2003-07-17

In many ways one can see the correctness in this by analysing the major movements in the 20th century that have embroiled America in war.  The Fascists so threatened the world that America was forced to fight them.  The Communists so threatened global civilization that the Americans were forced to fight them.  Most recently Islam now threatens western and global civilizations and now America is fighting them.<br />Fallaci, in her small book, explains to us the evils of Islam.  She describes the horrors forced upon women and the visciousness with which Fundamentalists treat their women(One of the terrorists siad he didnt want women at his funeral, especially not the most tainted women, Pregnant women).Fallaci explains how viscious Islam destroyed the Buddhist statues in Afghanistan.  She condemns the Europeans, who say they want diversity, and use diversity as an excuse to allow Islam to infiltrate europe, turn European cities into bazarrs and create human rights abuses in the very countries that espouse to be the beacons of human rights and exceptance.  Just look to the murder of the great Pim Fortyn or the murder of the Arab girl in Norway for speaking her beliefs and marrying a white man.  Fallaci shows how complasent Europeans have become and how just like the British appeased the fascists Europe now appeases Islam at its own risk of being overrun.  Fallaci's passion makes one want to join her to defend the Ponte Vacchio(saved from the Nazis) from the coming wave of Islamic terror and save the nude statue of David(or painting of venus), which will certainly be burkahized once Islam takes over Europe.  Fallacis book should be read and read again.  Her enemies are attempting to silence her in Europe.  In America she is being threatened with death.  Like the Germans who opposed Hitler we must heed her words and draw our swords to the coming threat.  Fallaci, an eminent athiest, understands the threat against Christian Europe.  She understands that the Pope must awake from his appeasement and stop applogizing and instead save Christendom from Islamic domination.  ALready Islam has whiped out the Sikhs of Punjab, the Armenians of Turkey and the Christians of Iraq, Lebanese Catholics are threatened with genocide.  How long must we submit to Islamic terror until we draw our swords and with the superiority of our weapons strike back against the tidal wave of Islamic immigration that has taken Europe by storm.  Fallaci calls us to wake up, she is the joan of arc of the western world asking us to awake in Chhristendoms darkest hour since Charles Martel defeated the Islamic hordes in the 10th century.threat.

In bookstores across America shelves and shelves are given over to Buddhism and Taoism but it is rare to find even one book on the Noble warriors, the Sikhs.  Yet these people are in many ways a unique and amazing religious group that inhabits northwest India and has followers all over the globe(a diaspora due to their persecution).  The story of the Sikhs, as painted so well in this book, shows how they have fought so hard against the attempts of the Muslims to create genocide upon them.  Their Hindu neighboors have also been hostile, although this hostility has become more blatent recently under Indira Gandhi.  The Sikhs were slughtered like animals during partition in 1948 by the Muslims who cleansed them from Pakistan, where not one Sikh remains in what had been their ancestral homeland.  In the west Sikhs have been the target of racist attacks partly because neo-nazis think they are Muslim(due to the turbans) and partly due to jealousy since they own so many businesses.  I recommend this book wholeheartedly.  It is obviously partisan but the author has an intricate understanding of Sikh lure and history.  The author does not touch on Sikh militism unfortunatly to an extent that should be touched upon.  He does not explain the Sikh revenge attacks upon Muslims in 1948.  He does not explain Sikh terror which is the reason so many Hindus dislike them.  But the book is nevertheless excellent.	2003-07-15

This read has several shortcomings.  Mr. Pipes attempts to survey many Islamic countries where Islam is the vast majority or the near majority.  In these short paragraph length studies he does not touch on one subject that needs to be touched on, namely the fate of minorites in Muslim societies.  He does not explain the ethnic cleansing carried out in many Muslim countries that helped create a homogeneity within nations like Turkey.  Nevertheless he provides a wonderful appendix that includes a list of Muslim populations of countries throughout the world.  What one will realize when reading this list is that the number of minority populations in a Muslim country is directly proportional to the time the country has been Muslim.  I recommend this book wholeheartedly in light of our need to understand and critique the Islamic world.  A good companion to 'The Rage and the Pride'.	2003-07-15

I beleive in the free market.  I beleive that capitalism invigorates the mind and cuases the individual to succeed where the communist will fail.  Nevertheless I recomment Marx's Kapital because it is an important analysis of the current system of the movement of capital.  His analysis is not full of propoganda the way 'The Manifesto' is, instead it is a logical view of our system, perhaps more of a totallity of the evidence then Adam Smith's own read.  I cannot recommend this read strongly enough to those that call themselves communists for this read will make you shiver as you realize that Marx understood capitalism more then any of his succesors.  Lenin and Mao and Gramsci were mere mice compared to the mind of Marx.  In the final summation when one has read all three volumes of Kapital(the third is unfinished) one will come to find that present day Communists have misinterpreted the view of Marx.  The reality is that the command economies of the soviet bloc alienated the workers from their labour more so then capitalism for it stole from them the earning that come with hard work and reduced the workers to slaves, something Marx would have felt was monstrous.  Read this book and you will not be a Communist, instead you will be born a Capitalis anew with a view towards reightous capitalism in which all are rewarded for their work.	2003-07-15

It does a good job delving into the viscousness of the Sudanese Civil war.  A war in which a viscious Islamic north is suppressing and enslaving a peaceful christian south, where oil may be located.  This is the story of Islam at the 'frontier' where holy warriors journey from across the middle east to push the bounds of Islam into new territory, creating chaos and svagery as it spreads.<br />Unfortunatly the book revolvs around a naive western woman who neither understand or has the least bit of insight into the truths about the African continent.  SHe has joined thousands upon thousands of foolish whites who have gone to Africa to 'feel the pain' of the indigenous people.  Rather then 'feeling the pain' this women spent her time in Lascivious love with a barbarian.  Naively building schools she just couldn't fathom 'why' the war was taking place.  This book is a good lesson for all the foolish westerners who hope to colonize the third world with thier liberal politically correct idea that with love and understanding peace will come.  Throw money at the third world and soon it will be peaceful and loving, these people like emma give no thought to the tradgedy they are actually actively participating in and have become unwitting allies of the butchers and slave traders.	2003-06-04

THis book expects you, the student, to delve back into the classical times and into philosophy for understand.  So far different from the light conservative reading of O'Reilly and so far different from the un-balanced unsubstantiated works of Michael Moore or Chomsky, this book requires you to think.  Bloom explores many subjects facing the American college student and the developing of the American conscious.  He points out the current trend(all too relevant today even though the book was written in the 80s) towards moral relativism.  He notes how we as Americans ahve become so afraid of value judgements.  He speaks about the inculcation of college students with all embrasing words like 'culture'.  He also comments on the non-integraton of black students on college campus's despite the massive outreach efforts.<br />He notes the current distrust of classic texts and the current trend towards Satre and Marx on campus while noting the decline of emphasis on western thought and western civilization.  This book is a great read, highly educational and of great value for todays student or young professional in understanding the lingo of the left.  For a non-fiction biography of Bloom read Ravelstein by Saul Bellow.	2003-06-02

He also led one of the few Israeli parties to oppose Labour/Rafi for thirty years in the opposition until the Likud victory in the 70s.  Begin is a ma larger then life and this is his story about the 'Revolt' against the British empire.  His decision not to fight fellow Jews and not to fight Ben Gurion are legendary.

THis time the topic is Israels first year in existence.  He touches on such topics as; secularism vs. religion, settling the territories, arab lands, immigration.  His argument is simple.  THe Jews, having defeated the Arab in the 48 war, treat their neighboors badly while at the same time creating a theocratic state and encouraging Jews(who according to him were living peacefully with their arab neighboors) to emigrate to Israel.  This book is very informative and well written but its argument is wrong.  For a less biased account I would recommend \\"From time immemorial\\".  For an account of the war read 'O Jerusaleum'.  Segev does no justice to the heroics of the early Jews who built a strong state in the face of enemies, but he does try and substantiate Arab claims that they were forced off their lands(after murdering thier Jewish neighboors of course).  Be careful with this book it is biased.	2003-05-20

He also talks about the heady years of Botha(the imperial president).  he explains the meaning of the word 'coloured' talking about the Cape coloureds and he talks about the Indian voting blocks.

During his tenure Singapore severed its ties with Malaysia.  He locked heads with Indonesia.  He also exported Singapores expertise to other countries like Pakistan and Sti Lanka.  This book chronocles this journey.  From 1965-2000.  Most interesting is Yews insights into the countries around his.  His meetings with asian leaders and the discriptions enclosed are indespensible.  Mr. Yew talks with candor and directness about the role of democracy and capitalism in the world.  He critisizes his neighboors, like India, who persued state-planning.<br />FOr those the critisize Mr. Yew one has only to look at the standard of living in Singapore and the standard of living in the neighbooring countries to see the disasters of communism and socialism.

It was a quick read.  Horrific and graphic in detail.  The Dr. in question is sent to Auchwitz in 1944 and he spends a year in Nazi camps.  He is well known for his personal observation of the Nazi Doctor Mengele. He details the 'experiments' and also explains the camp structure(his privilidged position allowed him to circulate freely and he had access to camp records and the S.S).  This book is an important document in Holocaust literature.  Yet it raises many questions.  This man collaborated with the Nazis to survive.  He does nto detail the true nature of Mengeles crimes.  Instead he seems to whitewash the horror and torture infliced upon innocents. I felt that he was not telling the whole story, maybe it was too horrific.  He leaves some questions to be explained, but his book is full of details.	2003-05-20

Wiesenthal is a legend.  Having survived the Holocaust he became a great Nazi-Hunter.  Documenting the crimes of the holocaust and seeking to track down the thousands of Nazi butchers responsible.  He dedicated his life to the pursuit of justice, keeping the memory of the Jewish dead alive as his sources tracked to globe looking for Nazis, who were hiding like rats in Latin America.  This is an important work.  Too often is the Holocaust viewed in a vacume.  We hear little about the pursuit of justice or the pre-Holocaust era.  Here is the story of the pursit of justice and the story of the notorious Nazi butchers like Mengele, Eichman and Stangl.<br />This book is also an investigation of the disappearance of Raoll Wallenberg and the questions of guilt of others associated with the Nazis.<br />A good read.  Very pro-Wiesenthal. Enlightening as Wiesenthal has also investigated many other interesting things related to Jewish history, like the presence of Rabbis on COlumbus's voyage.	2003-05-19

A compilation of many people this details every aspect of the famous death camp.  From the design of the ovens to the lives of the women.  Yet I think it is missing crucial information.  It claims only 1.5 million died at the camp, I think this figure has been dispuited and is low.  It also does not detail the resistance as I've understood it. Apparently in 1944 the Sonderkommando rebelled, leaving 70 S.S dead and wounded.  In the chapter on resistance the author only says 3 S.S were killed.  The reality is that Dr. Miklos confirms the data of 70 dead in his book 'Auschwitz: a Doctors eyewtiness account'.  Now the reality is that the rebellion destroyed two cremetoria and that Miklos witnessed these events.  I dont think the chapter on resistance focus's on this profoundly heroic act enough.  The book is very detailed and examines all aspects of camp life.  But I felt that it did not detail the crimes of the Nazi Doctors enough.  I felt it glossed over the torture perpetrated on the guinea pigs(humans), Miklos glosses over it too but the reality is other accounts detail the horrors of the experiments.  It also glosses over the treatment of women.  It does not mention the rape of women(or men).  But we know from accounts that during 'selections' many Jewish women were subjected to rape and barbarism.  SO why does the book cover this up?  I think these issues should have been addressed.  But nevertheless this is a great book about the machinery of murder.  It will make you wonder how it was all possible.	2003-05-19

It was through more then 100 years of training and discipline whereby a small group of young Jews, tired of being robbed and persecuted by thier Arab neighboors, took up the gun to defend their settlements.  How these romantic men, wearing traditional Arab clothes, took up the rifle and the sword and fought pitched battles with bands of savage Arabs, bent on causing terror(like they do today)vowed to protect the innocent settlers.  This book details this period greatly.  Shwoing how these Jews sometimes got out of hand.  How they formed gorups that eventually grew into the Haganah, and today the IDF, one of the greatest military forces ever seen by the world, better then any army King David ever fielded.  This is an important work that fills the gap in the scholarship dealing with the Jewish community in Palistine(the Yishuv) prior to 1948.  Pick up a copy of 'Terror out of Zion' for more reading if you want to learn about truly tough Jews.	2003-05-16

I bought it in the original Russian.  I had already read Volkogonovs study of Lenin and Trotsky and his book 'Autopsy of the Soviet empire'.  THis, though, is the seminal work of a man who passed far to quickly from our view.  He had yearned to detail the crimes of Stalin, the secrets also.  This grand book details many obscure facts not found in other books.  DIsjointed writing,as anyone fmailiar with VOlkogonov knows, this book nevertheless is very readable.  Many critisize this saying it was not written by a true historian, its not organized, it smacks of a freshmens writing, in that it does not develop a topic thouroughly before going on to something else.  It jumps around.  THis is all true.  Mr. Volkogonov was not a writer by trade.  He was a military bureacrat who yearned to breeth free and compiled this information, independent of the west, for years before publishing his account after the fall of the Soviet empire.  If we view it that way this book is unique, it is a testimony of a man who witnessed the evils of the Soviet system, who knew personally what Stalin had done and wanted to expose it.  He could weight the good and the bad.  This book is invaluable as history.  It is by a Russian writing about the failings of his own country, in its formative period nonetheless. A must have and a must read.  A landmark in Soviet studies.	2003-05-16

Unfortunatly he is sandwhiched between the Dobrynin/Groymko periods of the cold war and the more chaotic period of Yeltsin.  After all we have forgotten Gorbachev and the period of Glasnost.  Is this because the Russians have a propensity to forget them?  Its not clear.<br />Nevertheless this is the only book on Mr. Shevardnadze(the only one I could find).  SO its an important document. It seems to glossy to me.  It seems to not get at the beef, the meat of what was happening from 1980-1990.  I wish it detailed the afghanistan ending, I wish it detailed the various new nations created in the breakup of the Soviet empire.  I wish it detailed the new voices that came to the fore in eastern europe.  I dont think the book answers the question: How did so much happen, so fast?  Obviously Shevardnadze was key.  But then why arnt we told more about his role in shaping policy throughout the Russian sphere of influence.  I feel that the book approaches the topic from a political scientists analytical eyes, disregarding the historical questions.  Lacking flair and literary greatness the book is doomed, and yet essential for those who want to learn more about the Gorbachev era.	2003-05-16

THese scholarly works have now been followed by a much lesser work.  Clearly Conquest was responding from calls by his supporters to publish a book on the life of the monster, Stalin.  But unfortunatly, instead of publishing a scholarly, in-depth 700 page study he has publish a rather paltry tale.  Full of information it nevertheless lacks in several areas.  It lacks mostly in the details of the post Great Terror.  It lacks when describing the war.  It lacks in describing the 'doctors plot'.  it also lacks in the fact that it does not do justice to its title.  Stalin: 'Breaker of Nations'.  Conquest does not detail these nations.  He tells nothing of the Jews, Tatars, Udmirts, Greeks, Germans, Armenians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Poles, Fins, and Estonians who were victimized by Stalin.  Stalin was a breaker of nations but we dont hear about these nations.<br />Read this book, but then go and read Volkogonovs 'Stalin: Triumph and Tradgedy'.	2003-05-16

He documents the early issues faced by the Jewish state.  Relations with arabs were paramount.  Settling the borders and making them peaceful.  Mr.  Segev wants us to beleive that the evil Jewish state forced Arabs from their homes and wouldnt let them return.<BR>Lets first analyze what the Arabs did in the early days of the war of independence(1948). When they took the etzion Block they massacred all but 3 of the jews left alive.  Every Jew was killed in the settlement.  Butchered.  This was the fate awaiting the 600,000 Jews living in Israel in 1948.  SO when the Jews won the war the Arabs fled.  The Palistinians had no respect for the land and they fled without firing a shot. And then, after cuasing chaos and murdering any Jew they could find, these mobs wanted to return to their homes.  Well mr.  Segev wishes they had.  He secretly wishes the first israelis had been the last and he wishes they had been thrown into the sea, to swim back to europe, back to the ovens.  This is a revisionist account.  This book is full of antithapy towards the Jewish state and its founders like Ben Gurion, Golda, and Begin.  If you hate Israel, or you want another point of view, or your one of these people that feels the Jews are always at fault and the nice, peaceful, palistinians deserve ALL the land back, then read Mr. Segev because his books do contain good information.  But please pick up a copy of \\"From Time Immemorial' to balance your accounts of this period.	2003-05-16

White Afrikaners are being persecuted and massacred and the Black government does nothing. Not so different then what has happaned in Zimbabwe. This book tells the history of the white tribe of Africa. These people were not colonists but natives having migrated to Africa hundreds and hundreds of years ago(before the Zulu migrated to SOuth Africa). These people were forced into undue suffering under the British and suffered in the first concentration camps. THis book tells the story of Aparthied. And it helps to preserve the heritage of a unique people, living in a unique land. When we are older the whites of SOuth Africa will only be a memory, long since butchered and raped by their Black neighboors, they will suffer the fates of whites who have lived in ANgola and Zimbabwe and Uganda. The truth about the situation is that the current Black government has done little to protect the nations minority populations(Indian and White and Chinese) and they are just as intolerant, if not more so, then the whites who were in power previously.<br />This book is dated but it is an essential read for anyone who has been fed up with the view of S.

Clearly a supporter of this great man, Levy details the hunts and lives of the Nazi butchers.  An interesting account.

Too often we dont acknowledge the feelings of revenge.

The author blends together the actual tale of the genocide with the events that took place afterwords.  Many books take a far to introverted look at events as if they occur in a vacume.  This authot is able to show the events all across afrika, particularly the rise of Kabila in the COngo as an afterbirth of the tradgedy of rwanda.

Instead I recieved a book that is full of wonderful academic work but confusing to read, and not focused on the genocide itself.  I wanted a book closer to Martin GIlberts history of the holocaust which blends historical accuracy with documents and interesting accounts of the tradgedy.  Instead this book goes overboard documenting German complicity while shying away from the actual deportations,t he massacres, maybe this is due to a lack of actual historical record.  Fine...I will settle for that.  But until Im satisfied im going to read \\"caravans to oblivion\\" and other books on the subject because I want a book dealing with the genocide, not just the documents of government soruces and diaries by government figures.  I believe the author uses the volumes of sources to prove Turkish complicity.  Except I didnt need to be convinced of complicity by the Turks( we all know the Turks butchered the armenians, otherwise how can one exlained why no armenians live in turkey today?)

This book, lauded to be the capstone, the beggining for an exploration of his touted literary genious, is actually probably only useful as toilet paper.<br />So it goes... Kurt Vonnegut uses this disgustingly cheap segway to work himself out of every situation.  His book wastes pages and pages of precious ink talking about aliens and splicing in images of WWII.<br />Its pure trash.  Up their with Michal Moores \\"stupid White men\\".	2003-03-18

The focus is the governments of England and Germany and specifically the naval arms race between the two.  The name, Dreadnought, refers to the new class of battleships that evoke the modern warship, abandoning the iron clad models and ships of sail.  These new floating gun platforms were designed by both England and Germany and by 1914 the Germans(a landed power) were within striking distance of defeating the English navy.<br />The book looks at such famous characters as Winston Chruchil, Kaiser II, and Bismark. The author details the rise of Germany, its unification and wars against its neighboors and its quest for world supremacy through colonies and military power.<br /> The insights into naval technology, and prewar politics is interesting.  The focus on England and Germany as the main rivals and also the important focus on Bismark as leader of the German states is of great interest to someone who knows little about the extraordinary birth of modern germany.	2003-02-21

He rigourously documents a myriad of sources and illuminates the struggle that Isreal has gone through to come to grips with the Holocaust.<br />I strongly recommend this book because it touches on so many subjects and no other account will provide the reader with such a variety of historical events, from retribution to reparations.	2003-02-21

This book details the Spanish America war and its environs.  it details the important figures like Mahan, Dewey, Roosevelt.  It details the rise of guerrilla warfare in Cuba and the Phillipines.  Nevertheless I felt it did not eleborate on the importance of the conflict internationally.  It iverestimated the Americans as showsing the war to be won before it was fought.  The reality of the conflict, the first defeat of a European power by a non-european power(the Russo-Japanese war was in 1905).  Although one passage relates the newspaper jingoism detailing the first shots of the rugged americans against the sparkling halmets of the Spanish soldiers, it underestimates the impact of this war in which the Americans whiped european colonism off the face of the American continent.	2003-02-21

This book may be in order.  The problem is that the book is 557 pages long(text).  By page 184 you are at 1990. page 362 is already in 2001.  This book makes the fatal mistake of focussing so heavily on the present, dedicating 100 pages to only a few years time when the first 100 pages covers more then 50 years.  Is it possible that the current situation is worth so much text?  I doubt it.  Sharon has lived a life of action, serving in all of Isreals wars, the architect of victory in at least two of them.  He is an amazing figure and this book focuses to much on the present, not realizing that daily events in ISreal today are just as important as they were in 1953 or 1976.  If the book had dont justice to the other years it should be 5000 pages long.  SOmething is fishy in denmark when it comes to this book and I would only recommend it as a history of the modern Sharon era, pick up the autobiography &quot;warrior&quot; to understand the rest of Sharons life.	2003-02-21

I picked this up in Italy to read about all the popes(most of which I knew nothing about).  This book, with its short synopsis on each pope is a great read.  It also illustrates the marvelous variety of personalities that inherited the throne of peter.  From the smiling Pope John Paul I to the warrior pope Julious II.  It details the roman persecutions and shows how few popes were killed in the period, details the schisms and also the sexual adventures of the popes.  Shows how many popes were murdered, and how many had short periods in power.  It also details the papal election process and its developments.  A must read for those interested in a history of the Popes without the usual tenderness associated with some publications and the usual wordiness of academics.	2003-02-21

I never put it down and read the whole book by arrival.  It is an incredibly readable book.  As far as I understand it was oringinally published before sept 11th so most of the book is unbiased by the great acts the mayor performed on that day and afterword.  This being siad the author is great at detailing the intricacies of New York politics.  A worthwhile read for anyone who didnt experience the Guliani era first hand(in NY).  As another reviewer siad it does lack detail and certainly is in no way a biography of the man.  The book is a political biography the starts in 1988 and ends in 2001.	2003-02-21

Before the revolution the American colonies were driven into a viscous war with their northern and western neighboors, the french and indians.  Forced to learn the art of colonianal combat and deep forest fighting in a hostile climate the colonies earned a sense of independence.  This war was also dotted with the interested personalities of General Pitt and Montcalm.  THis book fills an essential gap in American history.

Unfortunatly for all his grandeur this publication is mostly flawed.  its essays ont he Japanese intentions in WWII, its view of Islam and his biased, illogical hateed of the Republicans and his view of Americas role in the world are all flawed.<br />Nevertheless I recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a fair and intellegent critique of the conservative agenda.  Most of illogical trash that documents Americas sopposed obessesion with dominating the world is not worth the reading.  Pick up Gore's book but I would recommend bringing along some other sources so you can better be academically equipped to rebut Mr. Gores comments.	2003-02-21

It includes looks inot his personal life, his childred, Uday and Qusay and also his sons in law and his bombmakers.  It covers the kurds and the southern Shia muslims.

It documents the vile lifestyle of men who pay for sex from Japan, to Thailand to the Phillipines to India and the savagery that is being forced upon innocent women that are traffiked between these nations.  Usually kidnapped from the poor regions, lured with promises of money these women are kept as slaves and brutalized from age 11 until they are rife with desease and they are casted out like trash.

It details the rise of Liberalism in italy and the subsequent rise of fascism and then the Christian Democratic control of Italy following the war.  Luminaries include politicians like Craxi and Mussulini.  Unfortunatly Mr. Smith is far to harsh in his criticism and almost purpously humorous accounts of Italy's role in political and military affairs.  unfortunatly there are few books that document Italy's political history for such a long period 1860-present.  Theirfore it is a worthwhile read to understand the long passage of Italian political history.<br />Unfortunatly I think Mr. SMith underestimates the great Italian politicians like Craxi and Mussulini and Crispi, the many faces of Italian politics, he makes fun of Italys military adventures(against the Ethiopians, Austrians, Americans, and Libyans among others).  It is unfair to pretend that Italy was totally incompetant when in fact it played a major role in this centuries many wars.	2003-02-21

Terrorist is the answer. Harts extensive interviews with those close to Arafat make for an incredible work.  Yet Hart takes their statements as fact.  he fully indulges the arab obsession with the idea that Jews control American politics and the American media.  He fully indulges the antisemetic ideas that Zionism is racism.  he fully approves of Arafats bloodthirstyness that led the butcher to walk into the U.N with a gun on his hip.  Hart goes onto allow his lying interviewees to distort the truth sourounding 'Black September' showing how sopposedly Arafat had no role in the murder of Isreali Athletes.<br />Nevertheless the book sheds light on Arafats extenive enemies amoungst the Arab states.  His experience in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon where his terrorists were bashed into submission.  But testamount to the one honorable characteristic of arafat he has never given up.<br />Hart will always be a biased man, who never realized the terrorists in front of him were butchers of children and the heroes of the Isreali state that they wish dead are the true reightous people of the middle east.	2003-02-21

A man who felt dictatorship was the ideal form of government.  Someone who opposed the church and led the 1000 red shirts to liberate Italy from foreign rule.

Most interesting in this book is the look at the Garibaldis adventures in Uruguay, the 9 years siege of Montevideo, sent me searching for more on the subject.
