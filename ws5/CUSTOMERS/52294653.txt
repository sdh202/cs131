This is the third book I've read by this author.  And so, even though her books are strangely disturbing, I keep coming back for more.  Ms. Nahai is a native of Iran.  She's also Jewish.  This gives her a unique perspective.  Her books however, are not political.  Instead, they are narratives of love, loss and guilt.  But she throws in so much magic realism that her books all read like fairy tales.<br /><br />In this book we learn about the lovely Roxana, a bad-luck child, born for sorrow.  How she lives out her destiny is the skeleton of the story.  But it is also the story of her daughter, who, at the age of six, watches her mother fly out of the window of their lavish home..  Yes, I said fly.  Roxana has that ability.  And this is where the story departs into a reality that exists in the author's imagination and whose words just pulled me into an intriguing story.<br /><br />Yes, I know it could never have happened this way.  But I was too busy swallowing up this book to care.  The characters are colorful and each is flawed in some way.  Roxana, of course, is the most flawed of all and, as we watch her leave her unhappy home for an even more unhappy existence, there is a seed of recognition of human emotions that are deep inside the human psyche.  The setting too, is especially interesting because everything  happens in Iran, right before the recent revolution, and then continues in Los Angeles in the community of Iranian refugees.<br /><br />Each character is indeed larger than life.  But I found a little bit of myself in each of them.  And the narrative flow is so well done that I just wanted to read and read and read.  Definitely recommended.	2005-10-04

My highest recommendation!	Subtitled \\"John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam\\", this 1988 non-fiction book won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award and I can well understand why.  I'm an avid reader of books about Vietnam.  However, this 790 page epic, with an additional 70 pages of acknowledgments, footnotes and indexes, makes all those other books seem lightweight.  Sixteen years in the writing, every word has been scrupulously researched.  Not only are there detailed descriptions of the battles, however.  The reader is given the opportunity of looking at the really big picture of the politics of the time.  I'm not talking just about the national politics though.  There were politics inside the military and between the Americans and the South Vietnamese.  We read about real people and the human disaster and the interwoven complexities of waging this war. And, central to the book, we learn about of Lt. Colonel John Paul Vann whose opinions of how the war could be won often differed from those of his superiors.  But we learn more than just about his military expertise.  We learn about the man himself.  We never really like the man.  And yet, we do come to understand him with all his warts and demons.<br /><br />Neil Sheehan was an award-winning Vietnam War correspondent for United Press International and The New York Times. He knew John Vann personally as well as the other military and political leaders mentioned.  But he goes much deeper into the character of John Vann, who died in a helicopter accident in 1972, than just his military experiences.  He really gets into John Van, the person.  And it's in these sections that the book reads like a novel, as we get to know John Vann, the man who could never really escape his early roots.  He was born in the South, an illegitimate first child of a mother who neglected her children to the extent that they never had quite enough to eat while she had many gentleman friends and spent money on fancy clothes for herself.  Eventually he enlisted in the army. That's where we learn about Korea and the blunderings and mistakes that happened there. I remember learning about this Korean war as a child.  But this book really made its folly real to me.<br /><br />During John Vann's pilot training in the northeast, he met his wife, a respectable young woman from a middle class family.  They married young and had five children.  But John was a womanizer and couldn't seem to help himself.  There were always at least one or two other women in love with him.  And that doesn't even count the recreational pleasures he enjoyed in addition. Towards the end of his career he had a daughter with one of the Vietnamese woman he romanced while keeping another woman as a full time mistress.  He also often exaggerated his good deeds when it came to his family, always trying to make himself a hero.<br /><br />This was a challenging book for me to read.  There were details of military operation which I had to read slowly in order to understand.  But once I got into it, a picture started to emerge.  This was a picture of mistakes turned into bigger mistakes, how the world views of the American military created a monster in Vietnam which was a sea of corruption as a way of life.  The Vietnamese people suffered the most of all.  It was really brutal and there were parts in the book where I couldn't help but shudder.<br /><br />This is clearly the most comprehensive and best book about Vietnam that I have ever read.  I give it my highest recommendation.  But be forewarned of its density and appeal to those who want facts and figures along with a very human story.ted in the army.

Subtitled \\"Tales From the Assembly Line\\" this 1991 book is the autobiography of a worker in a General Motors plant during the late 1970s and early 1980s.  There's an authenticity to the author's blue collar voice and he sometimes sounds like a stand-up comedian with the intent of keeping me laughing all the way.  I loved his sharp tongued way of expressing himself, the words lightning bullets full of irony and wisdom.  Ben Hamper is a likeable guy in spite of his alcohol consumption and contempt for authority.<br /><br />The book took me right into the heart of the factory and a world as foreign to me as that of any exotic country.  I learned a lot and laughed out loud, especially when he described the hi-jinks and scams and silly games they all played.  There was one part where he described management's idea of increasing production by creating a mascot.  I just couldn't stop laughing during that part of the book and I'm still smiling now when I think about it.<br /><br />Mostly though, I identified with the author in spite of the fact that I've been gently raised and have lived in New York City all my life.  Ben Hamper has a gift for writing and this book is testament to that.<br /><br />Flint, Michigan was going through some changes during those days, as was the entire American auto industry and this book let me feel this through the eyes of someone who worked daily 9-hour shifts at a dirty sweaty job and who was also paid top dollar for his efforts.  In this author's case the money went right into an outrageous consumption of alcohol.  Eventually though, it did catch up with him.<br /><br />The automotive industry has changed now.  And Ben Hamper is obviously out of a job.  But I did discover that he had a website and was still writing columns so his fans can keep up with his clever mind and his unique way of looking at the world.	2005-09-16

Researching family roots sometimes brings surprising results.  As the author describes in her forward, she wasn't planning on writing a book when she quit her corporate job to do nothing but genealogical research.  But as the details of her family's slave background slowly emerged, she combined factual information with family lore to create this saga of her mixed black and white heritage.  \\"Cane River\\" starts out like any novel with one difference.  All of a sudden we see a copy of a letter, a legal document, a newspaper clipping or a photograph.  Something clicks then - and transports the reader into the reality of the institution of slavery - a shameful dark legacy that is part our American history.<br /><br />The book is 522 pages long, but I read in a few days, in the heat and humidity of a New York City summer, finding time after work to read on a park bench Washington Square Park as twilight fell around me. That's when I opened the book and let myself be transported to Louisiana, at a time when everyone spoke French and the white families ruled the land and there was no way that slaves could ever rise above the institution that held them captive.  The book begins with two 9-year old girls.  One is white.  One is black. The black girl is the white girl's slave.  The slave might be able to go to church with the white girl and even take first communion.  But she will never learn to read.  And she will always have to serve the white masters.  Yes, it's true she is a \\"house\\" slave.  She will never spend her life bending down in the field.  But she will spend her life standing up.  Because, with the exception of a few kitchen chores, if a house slave has a few moments when she is not actively working, she is standing and waiting to be told what to do next.<br /><br />Through the character of Suzette, who was a real person in the author's family history, we meet this girl child who will never learn to read, as she is raped as by a white man and bears his child.  And later, bears a second child from him.  We meet her mother Elizabeth who had been sold away from two young sons in her former home.  We meet her deaf mute sister who works in the fields like a man has her three young children sold away from her.  We meet the white slaveholder who treats his slaves like children with a bit of benevolence.  But when he dies, his widow is helpless in running the plantation and the cruel overseer takes over.  Sooner or later all the slaves get sold off.  The author just doesn't simply tell us about it though.  She makes us feel it.  She has the slaves first come to be listed as inventory.  They have to line up by age, separated from their families.  They are all panicked.  Their families are all that they have.  Suzette begs the white father of her children to buy the children.<br /><br />But this is just the first generation.  Suzette's daughter Philomene has a story of her own.  She's lucky because she knows real love for a short time with another slave and bears twin girls.  Then he is sold away.  There's a white man interested in her though.  He takes care of her somewhat for awhile and she bears him eight children  Their oldest, Emily, is taught to read and write.  And even has her portrait painted in New Orleans.  A photo of that portrait shows a young girl with light skin who looks as if she leads a privileged life.  That is not the case though.<br /><br />We follow these people through the Civil War and through emancipation.  There are moments of joy and family bonding.  And, through the years, their situation does improve a bit.  But even if there is no more slavery, there is still angry racism which often results in murder.  And even though Emily's French lover and father of her five children wants to protect her, he still cannot give her any land, and finds his own life in danger from his fellow white men.<br /><br />Through it all, though, there is the family, held together by the women, who live through all the horror and somehow stay strong.  The book ends in 1936, with a glimpse of the racism which had replaced the institution of slavery.  There were tears in my eyes then, mostly for the sorrowful lives so many people had been forced to live.  But those tears were also of admiration for the endurance of this family who actually lived though it all.  My own life is very different from the characters in the book and I hesitate to say that I'll ever really feel what they felt.  But I couldn't help thinking that \\"at last, I understand.\\"ll the horror and somehow stay strong.

In this novel set in the Philippines in the 1970s we first meet Zamora, a wealthy Spanish landowner, as he helicopters to a remote area and discovers a small band of people who are still living the stone age.  His study of this group of people seem to be his hobby and his passion.<br /><br />We also meet a young girl who is a servant in his home as well as his troubled German wife who soon grows weary of her unhappy life.  There's some political intrigue and some interesting characters and the story had a good chance of holding my interest.  Alas, though, the author left too many connecting details out to give it a coherent narrative flow and although I continued reading, the plot never quite hung together.  When I finished the book I still wasn't sure what it was about although it raised the questions that perhaps there wasn't a stone age tribe at all, but just a plot on the part of the corrupt government to give Zamora access to areas which would be politically advantageous to the dictator.  If this doesn't make sense to you, it doesn't make sense to me either.<br /><br />Add to this a Hollywood film crew that has come into the town to make a movie about the Vietnam War.  This section of the book was probably based on the filming of \\"Apocalypse Now\\"  This part seemed to flow along well until it, too, lapsed into postmodernism and left more unanswered questions.<br /><br />There were some parts of the book that were extremely well done. One was the voice of the servant girl character.  However, this one character was not enough to save this book from being hard to follow. On the whole, in spite of some good descriptions of the locale, Dream Jungle was too disjointed for me to recommend.	2005-08-31

That's why I've always wanted to read it because if so many people loved it, I should love it too.  Right?<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />It's not as if I didn't try.  I took the book to my favorite spot in the park and pushed myself through it.  It was a struggle though because it's dripping with just too much honey, making it slow to slog through and making me impatient with the story.<br /><br />Written in the first person in the voice of a 14 year old white girl in 1964, we visit the world of the Deep South just as the spirit of integration was gripping the country.  Her mother has died under mysterious circumstances and she has been raised by a faithful black nanny who decides she want to register to vote.  This sets off a chain of events which forces the two of them to flee.  They wind up in a neighboring area where they are taken in by three Negro sisters who live together on the outside of town and raise bees.<br /><br />Each of the characters is fully developed and I think the author wanted to make them larger than life. She also wanted to throw in some sweet-as-sugar philosophy about the meaning of life as experienced by this all-female household.  The beekeepers have created their own religion, based on some catholic teachings about the Madonna but which goes much further in than that.  There are lots of rituals and lots of long passages of the philosophy of life.  This is a  coming-of-age story, especially when attractive young black teenage boy gets friendly with the girl.<br /><br />The best part about the book are the facts I learned about raising bees.  But not one of the characters was real.  And I felt annoyed throughout because of the girl's constant self pity.  Of course this was because she was supposed to learn some lessons in life.  I guess she did.  But all the preaching really turned me off.<br /><br />I'm glad I read the book, if for no other reason than to see what the public is gobbling up.  The writer is probably talented as the book as a good narrative flow. But the syrupy philosophy was so honey sweet and it kept me wincing throughout.  And I kept counting the pages that I still had to read in order to finish it and write this review.  So in spite of its other rave reviews and its best seller status I just can't recommend this book.the book, if for no other reason than to see what the public is gobbling up.

Isabel Allende's skill as a storyteller is once again demonstrated in this never-dull and always fascinating adventure story based on the legend that has long intrigued many writers and thousands of filmgoers through the years.  This is a story of the fight for good over evil in the person of a masked man dressed all in black who fought for justice in the early days of Spanish California.<br /><br />Most of this book is about Zorro's early years, and Allende has used her imagination and literary skill well.  The basic legend makes him the son of a wealthy Spanish landowner but Allende  went further than that in her narrative.  She makes his mother a half-breed Indian warrior, and she has him spend his early manhood in Spain, where he learns to fence, meets up with gypsies and falls in love.  There are violent politics going on all around him too.  There's Napoleon's occupation of Spain, and then the violent hand of the inquisition after Napoleon's defeat.  Injustices and villains are everywhere.  But there is never a doubt that Zorro will try to change that.  As a boy he sees the injustices against the Indians in California.  Later, he sees the injustices of the slave trade.  These are horrible wrongs.  But Zorro fights for justice.<br /><br />There are no subtleties in this book.  Everything is right or wrong, good or evil.  There is also no doubt that Zorro will survive victorious from his many adventures.  And so I just sat back and let the narrative take me where I knew it would go.  I let myself be carried along with the story and became Zorro myself, a young man of great athleticism, physical strength and high intelligence.  His motives are always for the good of all and there is no doubt he will be victorious.<br /><br />A book like this is a big departure for me.  I usually like nuances of emotion and books that have no easy answers.  But once in a while it is completely refreshing to let myself get caught up in an adventure story.  Isabel Allende is a master of her craft and doesn't waste a word.  It's great escape fiction that's fun to read and easy to follow.  I could open the book and read for ten minutes and know that those ten minutes would be a welcome change from whatever I was doing at the time.<br /><br />This is not great literature.  The words are simple.  The story is straightforward.  I winced at the horrors of the time and yet found them fascinating.  And, I also knew that Zorro would somehow find a way to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles.  This was a great read.  And definitely recommended.is a master of her craft and doesn't waste a word.  It's great escape fiction that's fun to read and easy to follow.

The country was called Ceylon before independence in 1948 and most of the action of the story takes place then, under the yoke of an English colonialism which penetrated into every aspect of life. The first few chapters introduce our main character, Sam Obeysekere, born in the early part of the 20th century to a privileged dark skinned Ceylonese family.  There are troubles though and deep secrets which are only hinted at in the beginning.  But as we get to know Sam better, there are some things that start us wondering.  Sam grows up, is educated at Oxford, and comes back to Sri Lanka to become a prosecuting attorney.  That's when he encounters the Hamilton Case.  A wealthy tea grower had been murdered.  At first it was blamed on the coolies who worked on his plantation.  But after a little investigation, that an Englishman was put on trial, something unthinkable at the time because this was a Ceylonese court. Even after the case ended, there were loose ends that were never tied up, but that was only halfway through the book.<br /><br />As the story goes along we meet some memorable characters, most notably Sam's mother Maud.  She was once of the privileged set, the type of woman who raised eyebrows in the 1920s with her flamboyance.  She drank and smoked and went to parties and usually was the subject of gossip.  As she aged, however, and her husband died, she depended on Sam who was now a wealthy man, married and with a son of his own.  By now my own feelings about him had changed as he treated both his wife and his mother badly.  Basically, Maud was allowed to live in the home of her young womanhood where Sam was born.  This home was at the edge of a jungle and she was virtually a prisoner there even though she had two servants, who are themselves interesting characters.  It was in this portion of the book that I learned more than I ever imagined I wanted to know about insects, snakes, plants, humidity, monsoon storms, leaking roofs and deep loneliness.  And I got to love Maud who somehow never lost her spirit and energy even though she started losing her mind.<br /><br />The author uses words well, a flowery style that seems a bit too over-decorative in places, but yet is entirely appropriate to the characterizations of the people and the worship of the English language at the time.  Through it all though, there is a rumble of discontent, and we're also introduced to the revolutionary who once was educated in the same English school as Sam.  He was also privileged but chose be \\"of the people\\", insisting on wearing sarong at all times, even with an English jacket.  Early on, he marries Sam's sister.  But that is another part of this convoluted story that at first seems disjointed but yet all comes together in the final chapters.<br /><br />One of the things I loved about this book is because it took me to a time and place I knew nothing about.  It enriched my understanding of colonialism and its many effects which still resonate today.  And it also introduced me to some very memorable characters, each of them flawed in different ways.  This book was quite an undertaking for the author and I applaud her efforts even though there were parts that dragged a little.  No doubt about it though, this is a fine book.

Set in working-class Niagara Falls, New York, a young widow and her 12-year old daughter decide to take a shortcut home through a wooded area after a 4th of July party.  But there's a gang of drunken young men hanging out, high on meth and looking for trouble.  What follows is awful.  The woman is left unconscious and bleeding but her young daughter manages to escape and get help.  It seems like an open and shut case.  But even though most of men are arrested, the town turns on the woman.  \\"She had it coming,\\" is the way they look at it.  <br /> <br />Much of the book is written from the point of view of the 12-year old girl.  Our heart goes out to her as she realizes that her childhood ended on that awful night.  What follows is a nightmare as her schoolmates taunt her and threaten her mother. There's a policeman, however, who was the first to discover the victims. As he watches the court system humiliate the woman and her daughter, he is enraged enough to take justice into his own hands.   <br /> <br />This book is a mere 154 small pages and is more a novella than a novel.  It packs a terrific punch though.  From the very first sentence, I was captivated, and read it at a breathless pace and cringed to hear about the horrors of the justice system for rape victims.  This is especially true in a small town where everybody knows everybody else and the families of the rapists turn against the victim.  <br /> <br />Joyce Carol Oates is a prolific writer and, through the years, I have enjoyed many of her novels.  I look forward to reading many more.	2005-07-24

Sometimes a book comes along that I just seem to sink into.  It is rich with detail and subtleties.  It is a story of an individual as well as a story of human nature. Its prose is beautiful and intellectual.  And the theme enriches a place and a time with which I am familiar.  Philip Roth's 22nd novel is such a book.  It won a Pulitzer Prize.  And I can well understand why.<br /><br />This is a story about the American dream and the turning point in the late 1960s when protests against the Vietnam War were escalating.  And it is the story of the effect on one family when their 16-year old daughter commits a violent act of terrorism. But this book is more, much more than this seemingly simple story.<br /><br />The very structure of the book broke a lot of rules.  There are more than 80 pages from an aging narrator who sets the stage.  He's in his 60s and attends a 45th reunion of his high school class of 1949.  The depth of detail here introduces Newark, New Jersey, which was a Jewish neighborhood in those days. It was these children's grandparents who immigrated to America, fleeing the pogroms in Russia.  Their children grew up working hard and prospering.  And their children seemed to be living the American dream.  Then things changed.  Especially for the family of Merry Levov.<br /><br />The rest of the book is a bunch of recollections.  Their order seems haphazard.  They explore the father's thought processes.  It gets deeply inside his mind and we see how he thinks.  There are long passages in which no actual action happens other that the character's thoughts.  Usually I don't like passages like that.  But in this book I got so into them that I felt real emotion and found myself feeling little gasps of recognition for certain human emotions that were exposed by the careful crafting of the author's words.<br /><br />The family relationships are complex.

It's set in 1932 and revolves around three different individuals who converge in Boulder City, Colorado, where the Hoover Dam is being built.  Each one has a story and these stories get well developed during the first half of the book.  When they finally meet, I felt I knew them all well.<br /><br />First there is Filius, an engineer who has just suffered a tragic loss.  He's extremely intelligent and this intelligence was cultivated in an upscale childhood in which his love of engineering and architecture was nurtured. The chapters about him contain the details of the dam building as well as wonderful metaphors about the land.  Then there is Lena and her young son from Kentucky.  They've also just suffered a tragic loss and are headed to Boulder City because it's the only city in the country where everyone has a job.  And then there is Lew Beck.  He's a short man who with a streak of cruelty and violence.  At times he can be sympathetic but he also goes further than necessary when seeking revenge for any kind of slight.<br /><br />This is also the story of a place and a time.  It is the middle of the depression and the City of Las Vegas is just beginning to develop into the wild and woolly gambling capital of the world.  There's a Wild West feeling to the whole atmosphere as well as the reality of building a dam to harness the Colorado River.  The story is well paced and I was immediately drawn into it, especially because the characters were so well developed.  I especially loved the parts about the dam construction because even though I didn't understand every technical detail, I was in awe of the difficulties encountered and the difficult working conditions for the men who built it.  Now, I wish that when I visited Las Vegas, I would have included a visit to this man-made wonder.<br /><br />The book did have its weaknesses though.  Sometimes there was a bit of over-writing and the characters a bit stereotyped.  But yet, I kept reading, I thought about the book all the time, and couldn't wait till I had a few precious moment to pick it up again and live in the world created by this writer.ped.

I know it is all fiction.  And yet ...<br /><br />Philip Roth is a Pulitzer Prize winning America writer, his body of work spanning more than five decades. His style is not fancy.  You won't remember an artistic turn of phrase or the poetic resonance of the words.  But you remember the story, just as I remember some of his short stories in \\"Goodbye Columbus\\" which I read in the 1950s.  His style has developed through the years.  It's richer now, more abundant with words.  There is one constant though.  And that is his love for story.<br /><br />In this unique novel, Mr. Roth takes us back to Newark, New Jersey in 1940.  Narrated by a Jewish 10-year old boy, we get a sense of his non-religious Jewish neighborhood and the peaceful lifestyle of his family, born in America and loving their country.  Of course they all know who Charles Lindbergh is.  But they never thought it possible that he be elected President of the United States.  His anti-Semitism is legendary but this is, after all, America.  It shouldn't really matter that the President admires Hitler and starts signing pacts that promise to keep America out of the war in Europe.<br /><br />We follow all this through the eyes of the young boy who watches with wonder the goings-on around him.  His 14-year old brother joins a youth group and spends his summer vacation in Kentucky to become more Americanized.  His older cousin runs away to Canada to enlist and returns as an amputee.  His aunt marries a rabbi who is dazzled by Lindbergh and even goes to Washington to a reception for a well-known Nazi.  His father, who is an insurance agent, refuses to be transferred to mid-America.  And his mother tries hard to keep the family from turmoil.  Though all this, there is a feeling of foreboding, and I felt I was right there, inside the young boy's head, as he experienced the events going on around him.<br /><br />No.  There are no concentration camps or gas ovens.  And no, the horror can in no way compare to the experiences of the Jews in Europe.  And yet, every time I picked up the book I felt chills.  Some of it could be linked to politics today but that, of course in the eye of the beholder.  This is fiction.  But then why does it ring so true. This is not a pleasant book to read.<br /><br />Mr. Roth is better in setting up the scene than he is in completing the story.  Towards the end the twists and turns of the plot are a little convoluted and preposterous. But I sympathize with the writer's challenge because he's writing about an historical event that didn't happen and trying to make it real.  And so I do not fault him for this.  Instead, I applaud this rather unique novel which kept me awake at night thinking about what could have been.Jews in Europe.  And yet, every time I picked up the book I felt chills.

That was an award winning book.  Unfortunately, \\"July, July\\", which is about a 30-year class reunion in the year 2000 of a group of people who came of age during that period of time, falls flat on its face.<br /><br />This is an interrelated story of what happened to this these people.  In the book, they are all now in their early fifties, and not one of them has really grown up.  It's a fast read, only 306 small pages, and there are some flashbacks to 1969.  But everyone seems to be have made poor choices and are unhappy with how their lives turned out.  There's a lot of whining as they all come together again.<br /><br />All of their angst has to do with their romances gone sour.  There's not a word about their philosophy or the economy or technology or any of the vast changes that have occurred during the past 30 years.  And, even in that \\"lost romance\\" department, I found myself laughing out loud in places which were supposed to be serious.  I believe that anyone who has lived a full life probably has had some romantic disappointment in his or her background.  However, the people I know don't spend a lifetime wallowing in despair about them and letting such memories ruin the rest of their lives.  That's why this book just didn't ring true for me.<br /><br />Forget about this book.  The story is weak, there's not a single likable character in the whole bunch, and the narrative is generally annoying.  Good thing it was a fast read and that it held my interest.  Otherwise I wouldn't have read past the first chapter.	2005-05-29

Born in 1949 and growing up under communism in the former Yugoslavia, she never expected that Communism would collapse and she'd be thrust into a war where formerly friendly neighbors started murdering each other.  More than 200,000 people were killed during the Balkan wars in the early 1990s and there are over 80 people now in The Hague on trial for war crimes.  Ms. Drakulic recently spent a full five months observing her trials.  And this book is the result of her observations.<br /><br />The trails are poorly attended.  Sometimes she was the only observer there.  The people on trial come from various backgrounds and from different countries.  Each has been accused of mass murder.  And they all were surprised to be arrested, thinking themselves as heroes, not as criminals.  Thus is the way of war.<br /><br />The book is short, a mere 206 pages, broken into 13 different chapters, each chapter dealing with a different person.  Of course there is a chapter on Slobodan Milosevic as well as his wife Mira, who was the most feared woman in Serbia, writing a column that could end someone's political career or sending a person to prison.  But there are also chapters on lesser known war criminals.  What about the soldier who was assigned to the killer squad which did nothing but shoot bound and blindfolded prisoners who were delivered to their place of murder by bus?  And what about the soldier who made sport of going into the prisoner's barracks and selecting out a few each night for torture and murder?  There are people on trial who gave the command to murder thousands.  And lesser known criminals who do not have anyone willing to step forward and accuse them.<br /><br />One interesting fact is that these people are all in a detainee center together now awaiting trial.  They are not fighting each other though.  To all intents and purposes they are friendly and cordial to each other, getting along well and seemingly forgetting the horror that they have recently inflicted on each other.<br /><br />All this is told through the author's eyes, of course.  She discusses her own life and uses it as a mirror to better understand the minds of the accused people.  She respected and feared her father, not unusual in her country.  She was friends with people of different ethnic groups.  And, most of all, she never thought that such bloodshed could happen in the country she loved and had her life disrupted by the war.  This book is also a personal examination of her own feelings.<br /><br />This is a good book although sometimes not pleasant to read. But I do acknowledge the author for writing it.

This 2004 book, winner of the Milkweed National Fiction Prize, is one of them.  Its set in northern Alaska and starts in the late 1970s, when the main character, nicknamed Cutuk, is five years old and growing up in a sod igloo with his father and brother and sister.  No, they aren't Eskimos.  They're white Americans from Chicago.  However, they are living an Eskimo way of life that most Eskimos have already abandoned.<br /><br />Cutuk has no memory of his mother.  She couldn't take the way of life and abandoned the little family when he was a baby.  His father, Abe, does a good job of raising the children.  They hunt and fish and live on the land.  A few times a year, they hitch up their dog team and it takes a full day to get to the town.  Everyone in the town is Eskimo and the children taunt him for his white skin.  Cutuk and his family are dressed in animal furs; the Eskimos wear brightly colored nylon parkas.<br /><br />One of the best things about this book is the detail of life in the frozen north.  There is no plumbing and mice are ever-present in their igloo.  There is constant work to take care of the dogs and hunt for food.  But the family is happy.  Abe is an artist who occasionally sells a painting.  He also makes wooden tables which he sells in town.  Otherwise, everything else comes from the land. The children learn through correspondence courses and study by the light of lamps during the long winter nights.<br /><br />\\"Ordinary Wolves \\"is a coming-of-age story for Cutuk as it covers the time period right up to the present.  He yearns to be an Eskimo but has to learn to accept who he is.  The story is rich with details of his everyday life.  I was particularly fascinated by the different kinds of meat they eat and I will never think of meat as simply \\"beef\\" again.  I learned about hunting and eating animals.  I learned about the balance of nature.  And I learned about how things are rapidly changing and how the modern world is taking over.<br /><br />Cutuk grows up and eventually spends time in Anchorage.  Though his eyes, all he sees is waste.  We follow him through his awkward romances, his attempts at earning a living and his eventual return to the land and way of life he loves.  The writer captures all of this with skill.  I felt I was right there with him.  And, even though I've read several books about Alaska, this is by far the very best one.<br /><br />I loved this book, loved the world the author described and loved the characters.

Here, the fictional character from Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\", the absent father, Mr. March, who is off fighting in the Civil War, is given center stage.<br /><br />Coupled with scrupulous research of the time period and her wildly creative imagination, she fashions a riveting tale.  She captures the sights, the sounds and the smells of a long-gone period of time that has shaped America forever. Some of it is based on the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau who were friends of Louisa May Alcott's father.  And I do believe she encapsulated perfectly the historical realities of the time, especially in Concord, where abolitionist families hid runaway slaves in an underground railroad and there was constant intellectual discussion about the politics around them.<br /><br />We get to meet Mr. March as a young itinerant Connecticut peddler in the South years before the Civil War.  He's in the bloom of youth and attracted to a slave girl. Inevitably, he gets to sees first-hand the injustices of slavery.<br /><br />Later, we watch him romance and eventually wed the outspoken Marmee.  We see his joy at the birth of his four daughters, and watch his faith rise as his fortunes get fritted away with misplaced investments in John Brown's failed ventures, cumulating in the tragedy at Harper's Ferry which was supposed to be a slave rebellion.  All this is told in flashback, as he writes letters home to his family, hoping to spare them the horrors that he sees every day during the War.<br /><br />There were aspects of the Civil War story I had never heard of before.  For example, as a Union Chaplain and teacher, Mr. March was sent to a plantation that had been abandoned by its Southern owner and became a refuge for runnaway slaves.  A northerner had leased it and was actually paying the former slaves a wage although their treatment under this new plan was not much better than under the old system.  Also, the man who had leased the plantation seemed at first to be cruel and unjust, but as the book continued, we soon learned of his hard choices and he turned into complex and interesting character.<br /><br />I was totally swept up in the story and couldn't put the book down despite the occasional feeling I had that some of the history was a little too revisionist.  But this is a novel and not a true story, and the writer's view of the world is through modern eyes.  I understand and do forgive her for this just because the story was so good.<br /><br />In spite of its faults, I loved this novel and was sorry to see it end.  Recommended, especially for history buffs and fans of Louisa May Alcott.tter than under the old system.

Life was harsh and there was a war on.  Eventually, her parents lost their farm and had to leave the country which is now called Zimbabwe.  Eventually the family settled in Zambia and still live there. Alexandra, however, married and moved to Wyoming, where she lives with her husband and two children.  One day, while visiting her parents, she met a man who had been a soldier in the defeated Rhodesian army.  She was fascinated by him as well as the whole story of what had happened in Rhodesia during her childhood.  A few months later she planned a short trip with him into the land where the fighting occurred.  It was a journey of discovery for both of them.  This book is the result of that journey.<br /><br />Let me explain the title.  The word \\"scribbling\\" means \\"killing\\" in the slang of the region.  And it refers to the expression \\"curiosity killed the cat\\".  She decided to take this trip because she was curious.  It's as simple as that.<br /><br />The former soldier, who she refers to as \\"K\\" is war hardened.  He's now a loner, living on a farm he literally carved out of the African bush himself.  Some native Africans work for him but his relationships with them are simply that aof boss and worker.  His former marriage had ended in divorce and it was clear from the beginning that he was interested in Alexandra even though she was married.<br /><br />She wasn't interested in him in that way.  And I'll say right up front there that even though towards the end of their trip there was some romantic tension between them, it never materialized.  The book instead is about their relationship to Africa and the way that Africa itself has shaped their personalities.<br /><br />I live in New York and my whole life is one of material comfort.  I turn on the water tap to get water, the air is free of insects and flies, electricity gives me light at night and cools my apartment in the summer.  For Alexandra's African family and also for \\"K\\", these are luxuries.  They are constantly lighting fires with a match in order to boil water for tea.  Their homes have no electricity.  They are always sweat soaked from the horrific humid heat.  Taking a shower means pouring a bucket of water on themselves.  If they have a car, gasoline is very expensive and they do not use air conditioning.  All this is a given.<br /><br />During their trip, K told Alexandra stories.  He remembered the guns and the death and the terrible fright.  He admitted to atrocities with deep regret.  Along the way they met some of the men he had served with.  They were all hardened war veterans.  One of them lived alone on an island with a lion.  Another kept smoking unfiltered African cigarettes even though he obviously was suffering from lung disease.  They talked about old times.  And how they had to go for days without water and it would get so bad they would be willing to kill each other for just a sip of the precious liquid.  They romanticized the fistfights.  And, one of the most interesting things was that they all seemed to accept the life they were thrust into and remembered the years of the war as a time in their lives that they felt very much alive.<br /><br />Wisely, the author focused her book on this trip and subtitled the book \\"Travels With An African Soldier\\".  Personally, I might have liked to hear more about her husband and children back in Wyoming.  I also would have liked to see a map included somewhere in the book.  But I think her intent was to focus on the impact of war on people, and on the small sub-set of Rhodesian soldiers.  By doing this, she made her story universal.<br /><br />I loved the book, couldn't put it down and definitely recommend it.r Alexandra's African family and also for \\"K\\", these are luxuries.

This is a sequel to the author's first, and longer. 2001 novel, \\"Azucar The Story of Sugar\\".  Both books are about exploitation of workers in the Dominican Republic, with the focus of the first book on a little girl named Azucar and the sugar industry.  In this second book, the little girl has grown up and is now an executive in the new industry that is paramount in her country - the tourist industry.  How this tourist industry also exploits its workers, as globalization has taken over the country, is the focus of  \\"Azucar's Sweet Hope\\".<br /><br />Alas, even though learned a lot about the evils of the tourist business, it was not as successful a book as the first. This sequel is only 186 pages long and it took fully half of those pages to re-tell the story and re-introduce the characters who I had already read about in the first book.  And, although it started off with a chilling murder, the rest of the book was more about the growth of the characters from the compromises involved to keep the tourist industry a vital part of the economy.  Yes, there was a new romance introduced that was supposedly forbidden, but it didn't have the punch of the former forbidden love affairs which had already been accepted and resolved.  And even though I had read and enjoyed the first book, I still had trouble following all of the characters.<br /><br />The book makes a point though.  And I know I will never look at the tourist industry through the same eyes again.  It was a political point well taken.  It was also rather interesting to see what became of the characters in the first book.  My interest was also renewed about that part of the world.  And it was a worthwhile read for this reason.  But for a stand-alone novel, I suggest you stay with the first book.	2005-04-23

Subtitled \\"A Novel About the Balkans\\", this seemingly simple novel is the story of one woman during one awful year.  Purposely, the author only uses the first initial, \\"S\\", throughout the book for the name of her main character.  She also uses only the first initial of the names of all the other characters.  This technique depersonalizes them all, which is her intent.  For this is a chilling account of the imprisonment and rape of Bosnia women during the war in 1992.<br /><br />The novel opens in March of 1993.  S is in Sweden and has just given birth of a baby boy who she plans on giving up for adoption.  The story then flashes back to May of 1992 when S's life changed forever.  That's when the soldiers came.  After that it was just one horror after another.  I cringed as I read it and, when I put the book down, I didn't want to pick it up again.  But it was a short book, merely 201 pages, and so well written, that I just couldn't tear myself away.  And I also couldn't help thinking about the life that I, myself, was living during that time period and how much I take for granted.<br /><br />Of course I read the papers.  The inhumanity of human beings to other human beings was documented.  But somehow, through this story of one particular woman, I felt the kind of real emotion that simple newspaper accounts do not convey.  I therefore applaud the author for making it very real to me.<br /><br />This is not a pleasant read.  But I highly recommend it.	2005-04-23

Co-written by three former U.S. peace workers who met in Cambodia in 1993, this book is a perfect fit for my interests.  Told in alternating first-person narratives, every word of their story rings true.  And, as an added bonus, there's humor mixed in with the horror which is so funny that there were places where I actually laughed out loud. Their assignments included Cambodia, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Rwanda and Liberia - and they soon lose their innocence about their \\"do-gooder\\" status.<br /><br />When we first meet Heidi, she's 30 years old and has just walked away from a bad marriage.  She's a secretary at the U.N. and jumps at the chance to travel to Cambodia as a peace worker for the elections.  Then there is Ken, a Harvard law student who knows he wants more out of life than sitting in a corporate office.  Andrew comes from New Zealand and is already working as a doctor in Cambodia.  Through their own voices I felt I personally knew these individuals and was hearing their stories at a social gathering.<br /><br />These stores, however, were more than just a tale told to entertain friends.  They were personal, such as when Ken had a romantic experience with an Israeli woman during a scud missile attack and when Heidi, on a short vacation, has an affair with an African tribesman.  But it is also about the abject fear they feel when the bullets are flying and the hard and scary choices they have to make when suddenly they are in charge.  The stories also held details of terrible injustices and their privileged and powerless status of U.N. workers.<br /><br />Andrew works in a hospital in Haiti that is not off-limits to men with guns who come in to finish off a patient.  Later, he is put in charge of unearthing mass graves in Bosnia and Rwanda.  Ken ties to get humanitarian aid for Hutu prisoners in Rwanda.  Heidi works the radio at a base in Somalia when Ken is in a life-and-death situation.  Their adventures are mixed with horror all the time.  And there is also a feeling of impotence.<br /><br />In addition to the human stories that unfolded in front of me, I also got an up-close-and-personal look at the U.N. impotence, especially since many of the so-called peacekeeping troops are thugs themselves.  Also, serious questions were raised about some U.S. policies which seemed to promise so much in Somalia and Haiti, but instead left the people even worse off than before.  I guess I always understood these things but this book opened my eyes in a whole new way.<br /><br />I hadn't expected photographs but there is a whole section of pictures in the middle of the book.  I loved each one of them because it made the authors even more real.<br /><br />The final chapter which puts them all back in New York was rather anti-climatic but I guess it was necessary to bring the reader up to date. However, I loved this book and highly recommend it. It's engaging, it's real, there's much food for thought and a lot to learn.in Somalia when Ken is in a life-and-death situation.

She's a good writer although sometimes I find her narrative to be a bit confusing.  This is the case in her 2004 \\"Four Souls\\" in which she uses a character she's used in books before, an American Indian woman named Fleur Pillager.<br /><br />The book had a good beginning.  It's set in the Midwest in the 1920s.  Fleur is out for revenge against the wealthy white man who had stolen the Indian's land.  Her plans are to make him suffer, but she soon discovers that he is very ill.  She becomes a laundress in his household and manages to cure him with the intent of making him suffer later.  Things don't work out exactly as she planned though and, as the story unfolds, she becomes hard to understand.<br /><br />There are several narrators.  One is Polly Gheen, the gently-raised spinster sister-in-law of the wealthy man.  I loved her voice and the way she tells her story.  Another narrator is Nanapush, an aging Indian man who is still on the reservation.  I suspect he had appeared in other books about Fleur and one of the problems of \\"Four Souls\\" is that the back-story isn't clear.  But Nanapush sure is clear.  He's both comical and wise and managed to make me laugh out loud.  He and his wife Margaret are always fighting but he loves her tremendously with a passion not usually aspired to elderly people. He commits some very foolhardy acts to show that love and this is where the book seems to turn into a farce. Margaret is a narrator too and it's nice to get her point of view as the story unfolds.<br /><br />The book is short, a mere 201 pages and an easy read.  I enjoyed being thrust into the contrasting worlds of the both the rich people and the American Indians.  Some of the central characters needed more development though, especially Fleur.  After the first chapter, she appears in the story but always through someone else's eyes.  And, after I finished the book, I was left to wonder about some of the details.  I suspect this is because this novel is actually a sequel. Therefore I always felt I was missing something.<br /><br />In spite of its faults though, I did enjoy Four Souls.  But I would suggest you read some of her earlier books in order to enjoy it more.e details.  I suspect this is because this novel is actually a sequel.

Winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, this book certainly deserves all the accolades it has received.  It's set in Virginia in the middle of the 19th century, but within a single paragraph it sometimes moves forward and backward in time, bringing the entire life span of a character into focus.<br /><br />The institute of slavery during this time period is accepted as a given, and the reader gets to meet a wide variety of people.  Most are black but not all are slaves.  Some have been freed and own slaves of their own.  The reader gets to meet them all through the excellent writing, making each character a multidimensional complex human being who happens to be living under a government-sanctioned slavery system.<br /><br />The central focus is the Townsend Plantation and the book begins with the death of the master Henry Townsend, who was a former slave, who dies of natural causes while still in his 30s, leaving a wife and about twenty slaves.<br /><br />Each slave on the plantation has a different story and I was soon involved with each person.  There's Alice, considered insane but still a good worker.  She roams the forests at night but the white slave patrollers let her wander around because she is considered harmless.  There's Moses, the overseer who yearns to be free.  There's Elias who first tried to run away and, after he has been caught, finds happiness with a crippled slave woman and fathers many children.  There's Henry's father, Augustus, who, even though he has been free for over 30 years, still is vulnerable to unscrupulous slavers.  And then there is the white, bible-reading constable.  He tries his best to do what is right even though he, too, lives within the slavery system of his times.<br /><br />There are many more characters in this 388 page book.  Some make their appearances for a page or two.  Some have almost a whole chapter devoted to them.  All of them are connected in some way with each other.<br /><br />Throughout the book I felt I was right there on the plantation, knowing each and everyone there through the eyes of the writer.  Of course the reader sees the injustice of it all.  But the reader also sees it from the inside, from each character's point of view.  It soon becomes clear that this is a human story and there are no easy answers.<br /><br />I found this book totally engaging.  In fact I just couldn't put it down and thought about it as I went about my own life.  And, even though I've read other books that dealt with the subject of slavery in America, this book brought out a whole new perspective.  There are complex moral issues here.  And wonderful fully-developed people.  But, most of all, it is a good story told by an excellent writer.  Highly recommended.ut the book I felt I was right there on the plantation, knowing each and everyone there through the eyes of the writer.  Of course the reader sees the injustice of it all.

I was reluctant to read this novel even though it was highly recommended.  That's because five years ago I read and reviewed \\"Underworld\\", another of this author's novels, and while I thought that the writing was brilliant, his world view was very disturbing. But I was curious about Cosmopolis. And it was short, a mere 209 pages long, a book I knew I could easily read in one sitting.  It took me more than one sitting to read however.  It actually took me several weeks.  That's because every time I put it down, I was reluctant to pick it up again.  Perhaps that's because it rings so true and its blows fall so close to home.  And, of course, the disturbing world view I had expected was there in all its glory.<br /><br />The characters aren't real.  They're not supposed to be.  Everything in this book is larger than life.  And everything has an exaggerated bitter sting to it.  The setting is New York City and the geography is familiar.  It's some time in the very near future, when big-moneyed corporate executives rule the world even more than they do now.  Eric, a 28-year old billionaire is one of them. The storyline is about him setting out to get a haircut and all the action takes place in a single day.<br /><br />Eric is in a white limousine which is equipped with every convenience the author could think of.  He has several bodyguards too, and a market analyst who interprets data from world markets constantly.  People visit him in his limo, including a doctor who gives him a daily physical.  Eric also manages to have romantic encounters with three different women as well as his wife.  He makes choices that have him lose his fortune in the stock market.  His car is attacked by anarchists.  He has to pause and watch a funeral for a rap musician. And he even gets involved in working as an extra in a strange and upsetting film. And, early on in the book, the reader knows Eric is hurtling towards real disaster.<br /><br />But the book is more than this storyline of course.  It is an indictment of the capitalist system that once held out such hope.  It shows the shallowness of the people, making every single character seem like a little marionette on strings and the whole tale one big puppet show.<br /><br />This is a fine book.  It is a worthwhile read.  I just can't help it though.  I hated it.<br /><br />Recommended only for literary buffs who relish discomfort.of course.

Once in a while a book comes along with an original concept.  And this novel, published in 2003, is certainly one of them.  Here, the reader is required to accept the concept that it is possible for an individual to time travel.  Once this concept is accepted, the story is proceeds as a love story.<br /><br />Told in alternating first-person sections, and clearly noting the date and their actual ages at the time, Clare and Henry each talk directly to the reader.  Clare is the one rooted in the real world; Henry is the time traveler.  And, believe me, he doesn't make time traveling seem like fun.  Henry, who was born in the early 1960s, has had his condition since childhood.  Suddenly, and without warning, he sporatically finds himself in a different time and place.  Usually though, it is in the same geographical area between Michigan and Illinois and it occurs within his single lifetime.  Always, he enters the new time period naked.  And, often, he's beaten up or arrested or finds himself freezing in a cold winter.<br /><br />Henry first meets Clare in the late 1970s.  She's then only six years old.  He's in his forties and coming from a future time period.  Through the years they meet in a meadow.  Clare accepts his strange comings and goings and hides it from her family.  Henry doesn't remember these visits.  Finally they meet for real in 1991.  She tells him about their strange relationship and soon they are in love.  This is not without complications though.  And here is where the story gets really interesting.<br /><br />I think the author is extremely talented.  \\"What an imagination\\" was a thought that was constantly on my mind as I kept reading the book and was drawn deeper and deeper into the story.  Each of the characters was so well drawn that I felt real emotion as they met the obstacles of life as well as the uniqueness of having a very special kind of secret.  I reeally enjoyed the book.  Recommended.	2005-02-19

And I've rediscovered pineapple!	It's not quite six weeks since I've been working with this book, and I am feeling so good that I just couldn't wait to write this review. Wini is my daughter and I'm tremendously proud of her for her accomplishments as a personal trainer and a writer. Her last book, \\"BodyChange\\" which she co-wrote with talk-show host Montel Williams, was on the New York Times' bestseller list. And she is, and always has been, an inspiration to all around her - not only in the area of fitness, for which she is a recognized professional, but in her positive attitude towards life.<br /><br />The book is targeted specifically for women who would like to feel \\"lean, long and strong\\". That sure does mean a lot of women, certainly just about every woman I know. Of course I'm included in that group. Just because I have a daughter who makes her living helping people attain their fitness goals, doesn't mean that I haven't let myself go. Though the years I've watched myself go from a size 12 to a \\"plus\\" size. I've stopped choosing clothes that fit close to my body and find it a challenge to walk up and down the subway stairs. Of course I knew I had to do something about it some day. But that \\"some day\\" always lived in the far distant future. And even after I had the book in my possession, I let it sit on the shelf for a couple of weeks, occasionally glancing through it, admiring the excellent photos demonstrating the exercises, but not really making the effort to do them.<br /><br />And then, one cold and stormy January evening, I made a New Year's resolution. I wanted to lose weight, lower my cholesterol and keep my blood pressure normal without medications. The tool I would use would be the book. So I opened it, read a few pages, and then got down on the floor and tried out some of the exercises.<br /><br />Wini breaks the book up into different sections to work on such areas as upper body, lower body and \\"core\\", which includes the basic torso. There was no doubt that it was the \\"core\\" which I wanted to work on and the exercises looked easy. To my surprise, they weren't as easy as they looked. No doubt about it, it takes effort. But Wini's descriptions were so clear, that I found myself enjoying the challenge. It must be her 20 years of experience as a personal trainer that makes her anticipate all the questions. The mental hints are the best. She'll tell you what to focus on, how to breathe and how to really feel what is happening to the muscles. I started with the beginner exercises. I know I'm not ready to move on to the intermediate yet, and that's all right. I still feel challenged by them. I like that feeling.<br /><br />One of the very best things about the exercises is that they include specifically targeted stretches within them. I've never seen an exercise book that did that. These stretches are my favorite part of the exercises because they relax the specific muscles that I have just worked. I'm always smiling at the end of these workouts, which, by the way, really do take no more than about 12 minutes.<br /><br />There's also a short chapter on food, a mere 26 pages of this 300-page book. The simple premise of this chapter is about making healthy choices. This is something I know. I've known it all my life. I just haven't been doing it lately. No wonder I was tired all the time. While I was reading the chapter I realized how much I love pineapple, but I never buy it because I think it is too expensive. However, I'm embarrassed to say how much I've spent through the years on junk food. And so I've re-discovered pineapple, and blueberries, and fresh vegetables. I've lost five pounds too. It's not the exercise that has done that. It's my food choices.<br /><br />I give \\"Lean, Long and Strong\\" my highest recommendation. Working with this book is definitely enhancing my life.re\\" which I wanted to work on and the exercises looked easy. To my surprise, they weren't as easy as they looked.

It's been a long time since I've let myself be swept into another time and place by an historical saga.  And this novel, set in the tenth century in the time of the Vikings, is what I call a \\"delicious\\" read.  Once I got into the book and the Norwegian names were no longer a challenge, the story moved fast, sweeping me up in this epic tale of adventure, plunder, murder and revenge.  The characters were fully developed, the time and place authentic, and I learned a lot about the politics and history of the time.<br /><br />The story begins in conflict as the Christian King of Norway is pitted against the old time religion of the people, who worship Odin and come together in an annual festival where they pray to Odin and ritually sacrifice animals.  There is a murder which results in a prestigious family being banned from the land.  Erik the Red is their teenage son and the reader watches him and his two good friends, go to sea, marry and develop trade.  They also \\"go a Viking\\" which means they travel to various European countries, loot the valuables and takes slaves.  Reading this is an interesting experience because by this time in the book I identified with them and liked them.  Though their eyes, however, the plunder was just part of their culture and even though I personally was appalled at what a Viking raid really was, I couldn't help but understand where they were coming from.<br /><br />There are also several other villains who plot our hero's demise.  They are sketched so well that I could almost find myself \\"booing\\" them every time they came on the scene.  This is not a book of subtleties.  It's big and bold and every character is larger than life. There are good guys and bad guys and even the good guys are cruel sometimes.  However, the author makes sure to let the reader know that the good guys' cruelty is justified.<br /><br />The book moved quickly and swept me along in the adventure.  If there was any weakness it was that I needed a little time to get the characters' names straight and, the author's use of words like \\"okay\\" made me wonder at first if the dialogue was going to be too modern.  I needn't have worried though, because by the time I had finished the first fifty pages, I was so swept up in the story that I no longer noticed little details like that. By then, the characters had sprung to life and I felt I was right inside their heads, living their lives with them.<br /><br />I loved this book.  It was a perfect companion on a cold winter's night when I could hear the wind whistling outside my window and let myself be transported back a thousand years. When I finished all 481 pages, I wanted more. I understand the author is working on a sequel.

And this book, subtitled \\"a story of life, love and death in foreign lands\\" is that kind of book.  It allows me to be an armchair traveler and live vicariously without having to take any risks.  And it also teaches me a lot.<br /><br />The author, Aidan Hartley, is descended from a long line of British colonialists.  He was born in western Africa in 1965, attended college in England, and came home to Africa as a journalist.  This book is about those experiences.  But, woven throughout, is the story of a friend of his father's who met a mysterious and violent death.  Aidan  found a diary of this man in a chest after his father's death - hence, the title of the book.<br /><br />If the book was just about this quest, however, I would have been bored, because his findings all happened in the past.  What intrigued me most were the author's more recent experiences, experiences which seemed to include several lifetimes of being where the action was.<br /><br />A lot of things happened in Africa in the 1990s.  And Aidan Hartley was there, risking his life and covering the stories for Reuters.  He was there in Somalia when the Americans sent in troops.  He was there during the famine in Ethiopia.  He was there in Rwanda during the massacres.  And he was in the Balkans during the bombing in Belgrade.  The stories were fascinating.  But his own reaction to them and how he lived was even more interesting.<br /><br />He writes about other journalists and bonding with them over alcohol and other drugs.  He writes about his romance with a photographer named Lizzie.  He writes from the heart about the destruction and despair.  And he writes about the stories that Reuters wouldn't print and the politics involved in his profession.<br /><br />The events came alive for me - the sounds, the smells, and the danger.  Through it all was the ultimate frustration of not being able to change anything.  There are odd insights and unique word pictures that I'll always remember.  Like that of a fellow journalist who was trying to stay in shape during the Ethiopian famine.  And so he jogged every day along the same road on which the emaciated and starving people were struggling to stay alive.  And then he writes about the celebrities who brought attention to the problem and the photographers that followed them around.  He tells that that when Sophia Loren was there, there were such mobs of people following her around that they didn't notice that they were trampling on a small starving boy who was too weak to crawl out of the way.  Rwanda was another horror, with hacked corpses everywhere.  Once, they found a small boy still alive in a mass grave.  They rushed him to the hospital.  It was a story that made big news and it was reported that he was given intravenous fluids and recovered.  But the truth was that the boy died; that story was never printed.  Hartley then raises the question which he asked himself at the time, if it might not have been better to let the small boy die with his mother.<br /><br />The stories are sad.  And they affected him deeply. Eventually he was no longer assigned to the front lines. Most of his journalist buddies were dead, having had the bad luck to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  It was difficult for him to re-adjust to a world where horrors are not the stuff of his daily experiences.  It took him a few years, but he did recover.  He is now living with his wife and two young children in the Kenyan countryside. This 479 page book is his legacy.<br /><br />Yes, I do recommend the book although I sure did wish the publisher had included a map of Africa.  Just understand though, this is not a book to make you smile.and unique word pictures that I'll always remember.

Yes, because of the lucky bottle cap, he will appear at the game, and, with thousands of people watching, he will have the opportunity to make one single shot.  If he makes it, he gets one million dollars. If he misses, he still will take home $50,000.  He can't really lose.  Or can he?<br /><br />Written in the first person, Nick Nichols is very easy to relate to.  He's an ordinary guy who loves his wife and daughter, and feels stuck in a boring job. Now, all of a sudden, he's a celebrity.  And he has only a short time to bring his non-existent basketball skills up to a credible level of performance.  And so he quits his job and devotes this time to basketball with the help of Angela, a streetwise African American former basketball player from Detroit.<br /><br />Of course I was interested as I'm a basketball fan myself, especially following the WNBA.  And now I was treated to an example of a basketball player's training, from the hours of shooting baskets to the mental tricks and attitude of being a winner.  For example, he does a bungee jump to just conquer his own particular fear.  And, later, there's a challenge on the basketball court from some intimidating teenage boys.<br /><br />Through this all, the narrator keeps up a lively banter, with clever dialog and funny insights.  He especially had me laughing out loud in the way he described Las Vegas.  And, in some other humorous scenes, both Angela and Nick sample each other's \\"soul food\\".  He takes her to a Jewish Deli and she takes him a barbeque place called Fat Daddy's Chicken & Ribs.<br /><br />The tension mounts as the big day grows near and soon Nick, his family, and Angela are in Phoenix.  But the ending is not simple as there are many more twists and turns of the plot and I found myself turning pages at a frantic pace, unwilling to look ahead to find out the conclusion just because I was enjoying the writing so much.  And then, just when I thought I knew what happened, the plot turned again and I was left with the kind of satisfying conclusion that pulled all it all together.<br /><br />This is a wonderful and uplifting book and there's not a bit of violence or disaster in it.  It's just a simple good story with universal appeal.  Definitely recommended.more twists and turns of the plot and I found myself turning pages at a frantic pace, unwilling to look ahead to find out the conclusion just because I was enjoying the writing so much.

One of my favorite genres is Vietnam. And this war memoir, which, by the way I found in the lobby of my building where residents sometimes throw away books, was one of those gems I couldn't resist.  I started reading it the minute I picked it up and was intrigued with it non-stop until I finished it this morning.  A finalist in the National Book Awards for 1994, the author writes with simple clarity, and it is this clarity that made it real.<br /><br />This book has no lofty ideals.  The author doesn't try to preach against the war nor justify its existence.  It is simply his own particular story.  There's humor here as well as heartfelt feelings of tenderness and fear.  I related to it all and could easily slip into the author's shoes for the book's 221 pages.<br /><br />Tobias Wolff was an intelligent young man who never did well in school.  But the army saw him as officer material and he soon became a lieutenant.  He was trained to speak Vietnamese and was put in charge of South Vietnamese soldiers.  He was a head taller than them all and his white skin made him stand out, especially when walking through areas that were known to have snipers.  He didn't think much about the justification of the war in those days. He just did what he was told and tried to live through it.  There is less blood and guts in this book than I've read about in other books about Vietnam.  That's not because the author avoided it.  It's just that this was not his own personal experience.<br /><br />One of the threads of his story is that of a puppy that the Vietnamese soldiers wanted to eat.  He had to give them money to spare the puppy's life.  Later, we hear more about that puppy and what finally happened to it.  Another thread which bookends the story is the author's relationship with his divorced father, an aging con man who has spent some time in prison.  They have a memorable dinner together before Tobias goes to war.  And then, when he returns, they spend several more weeks together. The father is described with a brutal honesty but there it is clear that there is much love between them.<br /><br />The best thing about the book is the author's writing style.  It's simple and clear and there is not an extra word.  Definitely recommended.r.

Set in 18th century France, it's a weird and wonderful story about a murderer and his obsession.  And it's a lot more.<br /><br />We first meet Jean-Baptiste Genouille when he is birthed and left to die in a filthy fish stall in the slums of Paris. Miraculously he survives but there is something different about this child.  He had no body odor at all. This frightened people although they couldn't really understand why.  But even though he had no smell of his own, his own sense of smell was so well developed that he could distinguish the nuances of the thousands of odors that surrounded him constantly.  And, after a harsh apprenticeship at a tanner's, he meets a perfumer and begins to learn the art of perfume.<br /><br />One day, during his adolescence he was attracted to a very specific odor.  It belonged to a young girl.  This was his first murder.<br /><br />This is not a simple story however.  Genouille is a strange person and is not capable of any emotion other than hate.  He is portrayed sympathetically though and I soon began to understand his inner thought patterns and the way his mind worked.<br /><br />We then follow his life.  He lives in a cave for seven years, in sensory depravation.  Later a rich scientist tries to use him to demonstrate his own strange theories.  Even later he finds employment as a perfumer.  It is then that his obsession gets stronger and he develops a method where he can capture the essence of his murder victims in perfume.<br /><br />This story is more than just this plot though.  It is a deeply analytical study of the social and economic mores of the time.  And, most of all, it is a study of human behavior.<br /><br />This book can be read on many levels.  The mood and the lessons in perfumery and history are outstanding.  And the religious symbolism cannot go unnoticed.  After a while though I got a little impatient with the story as it became more and more unrealistic.  However, this is a fine book.  And I know that it made me start to think about my own sense of smell in such a way that it has changed my perception of the world forever.

Set in Vietnam, and covering a period of time from 1916 onward, this novel grabbed my attention from the very beginning and held it throughout its 310 pages.  The author is part Vietnamese and part American and grew up in Vietnam listening to stories told by his grandparents.  There is therefore a sense of authenticity about the world he describes.  But this is not a history book although it is set against the events of the early and mid-twentieth century.  It is basically a family saga and a story of romance revenge, passion and adventure.  There's corruption and cruelty and great love and sacrifice. There's a rigidly structured society, which defines the loves and lives of people.  And then there are some really wonderful characters.<br /><br />The book starts with an arranged marriage.  We see the world through the bride's eyes.  We wonder about the groom along with her because she is not even present at the wedding ceremony.  She doesn't meet him until he comes to the bedroom that night.  She's in for quite a surprise.<br /><br />Later, we see the results of a cruel and corrupt government.  We witness executions, which are described in excruciating detail.  But that is just the beginning of the story that spans several decades.  During this time, we see the changes in Vietnam and get involved with the characters.  It seems as if something new happens on every page to further complicate the story.<br /><br />The title refers to the main character, who is a tapestry weaver.  However, the book itself can be considered a tapestry because of the way the author weaves his tale.<br /><br />I loved this book and definitely recommend it.	2004-11-13

This memoir is a result of that discovery and, even though some family secrets do get discovered, by the end of this 342 page-book, he and the reader understand that much of his suppressed family history will never be completely uncovered.<br /><br />I did enjoy the story itself, however, which deals almost exclusively with his childhood years.  Born in Vancouver in 1939, his memory of those early ears and his simple descriptions put me right into the young boy's mind..  He's the only child of hard-working Chinese immigrants in the land they refer to as Golden Mountain.  Chinatown in those years was a world unto itself, and the young boy was loved and cherished by his parents as well as a large assortment of \\"uncles\\" whose own families were still back in China.<br /><br />Through his eyes we see the elaborate Chinese operas, which were transported to Canadian soil, and which his mother always enjoyed.  We see his early encounters with English books and his strong will to learn to read.  We see him go to a Canadian nursery school and learn about the Christian religion.  We understand his Chinese roots and the many ghosts and spirits that are part of his Chinese culture.  We meet his dog and have to laugh at the way this loving pet took over his life.  Chinatown becomes real for the reader and so does the boy's obsession with cowboys and refusal to go to a traditional Chinese school.  Most of the book was devoted to this very detailed portrait. Basically, this childhood was filled with love and little trauma.<br /><br />It was only in the last couple of chapters when we join him in his quest for his family secrets.  This is written in the same simple style and delves deeper into the history of his family's experience in China as well as the new world.  We'll never know most of the story. But we do get to share his growing-up years and learn about the forces that shaped his world.nd learn about the forces that shaped his world. <br />	2004-10-30

I do love travel books, however - especially if the writer takes a personal journey to retrace a part of history.  And so, this book, subtitled \\"A Motorcycle Journey in Search of the Guevara Legend\\" has been intriguing me from bookstore shelves for some time.  I finally purchased it and it took me all summer to read, not because it's a long book.  Indeed, it's a small paperback that is only 302 pages long.  I've not been in a reading mood lately but I kept this book my tote bag and read it a few pages at a time whenever I had an idle moment.  I finally finished it as summer waned into Labor Day weekend.  And I must say I've enjoyed its companionship.<br /><br />In 1952, Che Guevara, then a young Argentinean doctor, took a motorcycle trip with a companion named Alberto Granado throughout South American.  When the journey was over eight months later, Che had transformed into a revolutionary.  He later became a hero in the Cuban revolution and was murdered in Bolivia in 1967.  Che's own book, \\"The Motorcycle Diaries\\" has become a classic and I understand it will soon become a film.<br /><br />I think Che's story is fascinating.  However, I, personally, identified more with the writer, who carried the diaries of both Guevara and Granado with him on his own trip and took notes constantly.  I absorbed his sense of adventure as he traveled the same roads as the legendary Che.  Good thing Patrick Symmes, who is an American, speaks Spanish.  He needed it throughout his trip, especially during the many times his own motorcycle, a BMW R80/GS, broke down.  Mostly, he was all by himself, going into small towns and asking townspeople about Che or traveling for hours and hours and hours and hours without seeing a human being.  I felt I was right there with him all the time as he journeyed from Argentina through Chile, Peru and Bolivia.  I leaned about these places through the eyes of this lone man on a motorcycle.  I felt the heat and the cold and the thin mountain air.  I felt his hunger and thirst and need for a place to rest.  I felt his fright as dogs chased him and his discomfort during a bout of food poisoning.  I learned about history.  And I watched him have to use his ingenuity over and over again to either fix his motorcycle or get a gem of background information and insight about Che from some of the people he encountered.<br /><br />I'm a senior citizen who has lived in New York City all my life.  I've never even been on a motorcycle and my world is paved with sidewalks.  This book is probably the closest I'll ever be to motorcycle riding in undeveloped areas of South America.  But I could be there vicariously whenever I opened this little book.  I loved every minute of this reading experience.

I took this one with me to read one day because it was the smallest and shortest one of the bunch.  I sure was surprised when I quickly discovered that, although it was only 247 pages long, it certainly did pack a wallop.  I think it is my favorite so far and I've read quite a few of this author's books.<br /><br />Written way back in 1938, it is set in a world that probably exists only in the memories of the Brits who visited Brighton during that year.  For those of you not familiar with the place, Brighton is a seaside resort frequented by working class people.  There are hotels and restaurants, a racetrack and all kinds of Boardwalk amusements.  It is also run by a mob which rivals any in greed and violence.  As usual with Graham Greene, there is a theme of good and evil.  The boy named Pinkie is bad; the girl he romances named Rose is good.  Both are Catholics and the Catholic belief system looms large in this story, adding depth to the excellent characterizations.<br /><br />The writing is excellent, the descriptions clear and concise.  It didn't even take me long to pick up the British slang which included words I had never heard before.  There are several murders in this book.  And some unforgettable characters.  I'll never forget big bosomed good-natured Ida who sets off to solve the murders and save poor Rose's life.  There are also some great mob characters.<br /><br />The title of the book has several meanings.  It's not only about the place itself.  There's a kind of rock candy sold there that is referred to as Brighton Rock.  And one of the themes is that it tastes the same all the way through no matter how far down you eat it.  Clearly this refers to the main character Pinkie, who is also referred to as \\"The Boy\\" and is rotten right down to his core.<br /><br />Put all these elements together and the result is an excellent story that gripped me from the beginning and which I couldn't put down until it was finished.  And even though I know that the Brighton of 1938 is no more, I sure would like to visit it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.m the beginning and which I couldn't put down until it was finished.

That's why I haven't read any of them in a long time. However, this book is different. This is non-fiction. And it's all about him.<br /><br /> The first section is an autobiography of his life. I found this fast-paced and interesting reading and it gave me a bit of insight on this man who has made such a name for himself in the writing world. He and his brother were raised by his loving single mother and their childhood experiences included playing in the woods, a painful ear infection and lots of childhood mischief making. He has only good things to say about his wife; they've been married for more than 30 years and have three grown children and a new grandchild. Stephen King worked hard to learn his craft of writing and money was tight at the beginning of his career. Now, of course, this has changed. But there are still other kinds of struggles. This is all fun reading, especially because he is so good at writing.<br /><br /> The second part of the book dealt specifically with the craft of writing. I found the part about grammar boring. But I enjoyed learning about his personal style and the process of how he works. Some of this reminded me of articles I've read in \\"Writer's Digest\\". They are inspiring. But yet, in all the years I've been writing, and all the advice I've received, very little of it has ever worked for me.<br /><br /> The last third of the book is the story of his terrible accident in 1999, an accident that happened while he was in the process of writing \\"On Writing\\". He was walking along a road and was hit by a van. His pelvis was crushed and he broke a lot of bones. He almost died. This third of the book is about his will to survive and how he coped with the pain and recovery process. This is all very moving and easy to identify with. It was difficult for him, but the completion of this book is testament to his courage. I feel I got to know him as a person. And I like him.<br /><br /> This is a good book by a good writer. He shares pieces of himself that made me understand him. And one of these days I might just read another one of his novels.a good writer. He shares pieces of himself that made me understand him.

Coetzee is himself a noted literary figure.  As a matter of fact this South African writer has recently won a Nobel prize. In this book, he takes the opportunity to discuss a wide variety of moral and ethical concerns through the voice of his main character, Elizabeth Costello, an aging Australian novelist who is called upon again and again to give lectures on the literary circuit.<br /><br />We meet her first on a American college campus, her son there in an effort to assist her.  And when her lecture, which turns out to be a rambling discussion of Kafka, is not well received, he has his own little adventure.  We meet him again later when she stays in his home in Boston to give yet another lecture.  This time she goes off on a tangent about animal rights, making the day uncomfortable for John and his wife.  Later, she's off to a cruise ship where she finds herself giving a lecture along with an ex-lover of hers.  And still later, she goes to Africa where her sister is a nun.  We see her in Amsterdam considering the nature of evil.  We learn some of her erotic recollections.  And always we see her approaching the end of her life.<br /><br />The book started slowly and I found some of her early lectures boring, especially since I didn't know some of her literary references.  But as it continued, I enjoyed some of her discussions.  J.M. Coetzee is a fine writer with a vast command of language.  I found my mind stimulated and started to look at some basic concepts with fresh eyes.  Her character was developed perfectly and, in some ways, I even identified with this old woman.<br /><br />This is a good piece of literature that provokes quite a bit of food for thought. For that reason I recommend it even though I know I absorbed just a small part of it. But that part was certainly worthwhile.<br /><br />.	2004-08-04

It consists of extremely detailed descriptions of a group of people living in one small neighborhood in England.  The beginning foreshadows a terrible accident.  And then the reader is led to wonder about what that might be.<br /><br />None of the characters are ever named.  One physical detail as well as the number of their apartment is used to identify them.  The become \\"the boy with the sore eyes in Number 18\\" or \\"the wife of the old man with weary lungs in Number 20\\".  Running through all this is a narrative of a young woman who finds herself pregnant.  It sounds like a good story.  And, eventually I got caught up with it.<br /><br />I must say I admire the writing and the inventiveness of the prose style.  I soon found myself plunged into that neighborhood and getting to know the people.  There was a lot of suspense because I knew that something terrible was going to happen.  But then, even though the accident itself is described, the conclusion was confusing and left me with more questions than answers. This was the author's intent, of course.  After all, this is considered a \\"post-modern\\" book. It lets the reader come to his or her own conclusions.  I don't like that.<br /><br />Therefore, even though some literary types might enjoy this book, and I do appreciate its writing style and its cleverness, I can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.	2004-07-02

Loosely based on a real incident that happened in Australia many years ago, the author took the concept and ran with it to create his own literary work, one that plays with the reader's credibility.<br /><br />This novel is about a hoax.  It's starts when Susan Wode-Douglas, an editor of a London poetry magazine, travels to Kuala Lampur with an old family friend, John Slater, who she suspects of being her mother's ex-lover and the cause of her suicide.  It's an unpleasant holiday in many ways, but then she comes in contact with Christopher Chubb, a middle-aged Australian man, working as a bike mechanic and having an incredible story to tell.<br />John Slater warns her about Chubb but she's fascinated because he shows her a piece of poetry that wins her heart immediately Of course she must then listen to his outrageous story, which might or might not be true.  It's a story of double-crossings and suicide and horror that goes on and on.  She hears of a beautiful woman and a baby girl and a kidnapping.  She hears of physical discomfort and fear and loneliness and suffering of the soul.  Chubb tells her how he created a literary icon in order to play a practical joke on a colleague.  Then this supposedly imagined literary figure came to life.  Is Christopher Chubb insane?  She can't really tell and neither could I.<br /><br />The best part of the book is the descriptions of the people.  The author has a knack for making me feel every bit of sweat that comes off of a forehead, and gives meaning to every crinkle of an eyebrow.  The search for the perfect piece of poetry seemed silly to me.  But the obsession of our heroine did not.  She becomes a fanatic herself as she goes after her prize, which would be the one copy of a hand-written book of poetry from the now mythical figure.<br /><br />The problem with the book is that there was no clear resolution.  I did get involved and wanted to keep reading.  But then I was disappointed at the end.  So in spite good writing, I cannot recommend this to anyone but the most dedicated literary mavens.g, I cannot recommend this to anyone but the most dedicated literary mavens.	2004-06-24

Years have passed and she has several other books to her credit.  From the photo on the book jacket I see her hair is now gray and know that and she has lived through a changing America. The 70s and the peace movement have influenced her.  And basically, this is what her book is about, told through the eyes of her Buddhist faith and her deep believe in peace.<br /><br />The book is 402 pages long and is divided into three sections.  Each one is different and yet connected.  The first section is pure memoir, written with an artist's touch.  It's the story of the fire in her Oakland community in the early 1990s and how her home burned to the ground. Among other things, a manuscript for a novel was destroyed. She has rewritten that novel which is the second, and longest, section of the book.  The third sections tell of her experiences in running writing workshops for veterans, and this section could be classified as \\"self-help\\".  Hence there is confusions of genres which makes it difficult for libraries and booksellers to categorize this book.<br /><br />The entire work might be thought of in the context of literature in response to war and can be viewed as an epic journey, as our heroine must conquer obstacles and develop much self knowledge as she brings her message of peace to the world.  She's well versed in the classics and there are constant references the Odyssey and other literary works as well as symbolism from all of the world's religions.  In the first and last sections, the writer, herself, is in the center as she searches for community and finds possibilities for peace by creating communities that go far beyond the bonds of family and geography.<br /><br />Sometimes her writing was a little too descriptive for me.  For example, a tree might be beautiful but a description of several paragraphs slowed down the action.  But I did relate to her sense of loss regarding her manuscript.  And I really did like the novel she finally wrote in which a fictional couple, running away from the Vietnam draft, move with their young son to Hawaii and form a community of war protestors, including Vietnam soldiers who are fleeing the war.  It was a bit preposterous but it was a good story, well told and I particularly loved the Hawaii she described.  The last section inspired me as a writer and I found I even started using one of her techniques called \\"walking meditation\\" to let myself discover some of my personal writing needs.<br /><br />I find the theme of war and peace in the context of Vietnam a little outdated.  So much has happened since then as our world has changed.  And, in a way, she is still locked in the thinking of the 70s.  The anti-war message is a good one even though I think she is a bit naïve. However, she certainly is doing her part in trying to make positive changes.  She uses her gift of writing to do this. I applaud her for her efforts.  She actually makes the concept of \\"peace\\" seem possible.  That is a good thing.me.  For example, a tree might be beautiful but a description of several paragraphs slowed down the action.

So much has happened since then as our world has changed.  And, in a way, she is still locked in the thinking of the 70s.  The anti-war message is a good one even though I think she is a bit naïve. However, she certainly is doing her part in trying to make positive changes.  She uses her gift of writing to do this. I applaud her for her efforts.  She actually makes the concept of \\"peace\\" seem possible.  That is a good thing.	2004-06-12

I'm glad to say that now I've joined their ranks.  I've never seen magic realism, the essence of Latin American fiction, done so well.  The story drew me in and held me fast for its full 458 pages.  All this was done without one wasted word or one moment when my interest lapsed. The book is pure fiction in every sense of the word.  Right from the beginning I knew that things couldn't have happened the way they did.  But I was so enchanted with the author's use of poetic imagery and storytelling ability, that I found it hard to put the book down.  And when I did, the images lingered, forcing me to think about them well beyond the scope of the story.<br /><br />This is the tale of the rise and fall of a mythical town somewhere in South America founded by the Jose Arcadio Buendia family.  It follows the town and its people for 100 years and I was glad there was a family tree printed at the front of the book because many of the characters had the same, or similar names.  We meet gypsies and soldiers and circus performers.  We see a beautiful woman disappear into the sky.  We see blood from a suicide travel miles down a street.  We see copulation both within and outside of marriage.  We meet a woman who chooses a lifetime of virginity.  We see hard work and self-indulgence.  There's a rainstorm that lasts four years.  And an illness that keeps people awake for months.  There's the impact of the railroad and a banana plantation. There is a war that rages for years and years.  There is  death by firing squad or senility.  Some of the people live as long as 120 years or more. There's a lot of sadness.  And the conclusion is brutal. Yet, so  much of it the book is so comic that I laughed out loud at times.  Always, however, there is the central theme of solitude.  Every character, in one way or another, lives in his or her own isolation. And, believe it or not, it all seems real.<br /><br />I loved this book.  It was a delicious refuge to take me out of my ordinary world and let me experience this mini-masterpiece.  Highly recommended.ms real.<br /> <br />I loved this book.

And the characters leap off the pages	Toni Morrison is a fine writer and this 2003 novel shows her true mastery of the craft.  Her books are always thought-provoking and disturbing and \\"Love\\" is no exception.  Using prose that reads like pure poetry, this is the story of that spans several generations.  At its center is Bill Cosey, the wealthy and powerful man who owns a resort hotel for African Americans in the twenties and thirties.  He's black too, as are all the main characters in the book, and the sense of the town with its many contrasts is captured completely by the author.<br /><br />But the essence of the story isn't about Bill.  It's about the many women whose lives he affected, and basically ruined, through the years.  There's his aging widow who was his child bride.  There's his granddaughter who was once a childhood friend of the widow.  There's the young and tough former inmate of a correctional institution who comes to work for the widow and begins to spread havoc of her own. She romances the grandson of a local couple who  knew Bill Cosey personally and understand the impact he still has on them all, even 25 years after his death.<br /><br />There's lots of hate in this book.  Lots of anger.  And characters so well developed that they leap off the pages.  The book is all back-story until the unsettling conclusion.  The reader is spoon fed the details a little at the time until it all comes together like a complex and unnerving mystery.  The end of the book puts most of the pieces of the puzzle together.  But, similar to another novel of her hers, \\"Paradise\\", the reader is left hanging.  And, when I reread the last couple of chapters, I saw it was done on purpose as her own particular literary technique.<br /><br />In spite of its title, this is a sad and somber book.  The love it describes is lost in a moment only to be reclaimed for another moment after a lifetime of hatred.  Characters scheme and live to excess and hurt each other.  And even acts of passion read like acts of cruelty.  It is not a pleasant book to read even though I do applaud Ms. Morison's talent.ty.

The six stories are short too.  And they all left me with an uneasy feeling.  I'm sure that was the author's intention.  After all, each one takes plays in 1995, in the weeks after the Kobe earthquake.  None of the stories are about the earthquake itself though.  Rather, they all use it as a distant backdrop to develop memorable characters, each coming to terms with the concept of the earth shaking under their feet.<br /><br />The stories are both real and surreal.  The people in them are troubled.  Some have allegorical stories within.  And all have fully developed characters.  There's a man who tries to understand why his former wife says he has nothing inside himself.  There's a humanized frog who convinces a man that they have to save Tokyo from another earthquake.  There's a woman who travels to Thailand and learns to deal with the fact of her own mortality.  There are three friends who must come to terms with their  strange love triangle which has gone on for many years.  There's a man who loves to build bonfires.  All of the themes seem a bit out of focus, like something is going on that I can't quite grasp.<br /><br />Clearly, the author is talented.  However the stories ended too abruptly for my taste.  And, after each I had the same thought.  \\"What was THAT about?\\"	2004-05-23

In this, her fourth novel, she again displays her depth of understanding of her people.  She writes clear, sharp, poignant sentences that go straight to the heart.  And the story, itself, is chilling.<br /><br />The book is episodic and can be looked at a series of short stories.  But they're all interrelated, and tell the story of Haiti over the past twenty years.  A \\"dew breaker\\" is a prison guard who tortures the captives in his charge.  And he is the central character in the book.  He now lives in Brooklyn and has a loving wife and a grown up daughter.  He now works as a barber and his past seems a long time ago. We see him through his daughter's eyes as he reveals his true past to her.  The daughter loves her father but this new fact about his life is hard to accept.<br /><br />We also meet other Haitian people, living in America.  There's the nurse who sends most of her paycheck home to her mother.  There's the young man who brings his wife to this country.  There's another man who travels back to Haiti to visit his dying aunt.  There are three Haitian women learning English and sharing their stories with each other.<br /><br />Eventually, we flash back to the story of the \\"dew breaker\\" in Haiti.  It's not a pleasant story but yet a very human one.  Even though we don't forgive, we do understand.<br /><br />I was a little reluctant to read this book.  I thought it would have detailed horrors and be excessively brutal.  I was glad that Ms. Danticant, in her wisdom, spent most of her time on character development and story.  She only put in a few of the horrible details, mostly focusing on the people, rather than on the gore.<br /><br />The book is only 242 pages long, a fast read.  It left me with a deep understanding of Haiti, its people, and what is going on in the news today.	2004-05-08

This book by Dorothy Uhnak reminds me of Mario Puzo and Harold Robbins. I've known that since I read her first book many years ago.  Dorothy Uhnak is a former police officer and writes books about the Mafia, police investigations and an ethnic New York that I recognize.  She also writes about Queens and her book, The Investigation, over twenty years ago, was loosely based on a murder that took place right in my home town. I've read other books of hers too -- namely Law and Order and the Ryer Avenue Story.  I've never seen a photo of her, but she must be in her seventies now and I picture her looking something like Geraldine Ferraro.<br />I can never resist her books, and was impelled to buy Codes of Betrayal when I saw it in a book store. The basic story is about an Irish-Italian cop whose grandfather is a Mafia don.  Although the story is predictable, I couldn't put the book down.  The story just draws me in to a world that has fascinated me all my life.  I read the book in a couple of big gulps, enjoying every minute of the ride.	2004-05-08

It's a short book, merely 158 pages long, but yet it pulled me right into the story of this young girl's life and captured me with its simple yet lyrical quality.<br /><br />Mostly, it's told from a child's point of view and we get to experience it all. First there's the well-meaning but misguided sponsor, and later there are several rundown apartments.  There's a whole new language to learn.  And an American school to master.  Her father and mother work hard at low paying jobs.  The father drinks.  There are many arguments.  Growing up full of conflicts and misunderstandings.  And memories of Vietnam which can't be erased.<br /><br />Through it all the girl keeps her sense of wonder.  And that is where the beauty of this small book lies.  The voice is fresh, the words are simple.  And yet it rings with poetic beauty.	2004-05-07

He wrote this book in 1998, just before the recent troubles, and, while I was reading the book I kept thinking that it represented a somewhat kinder gentler time.  True, there were checkpoints and identity cards and clear-cut tension between Arabs and Jews, but it was still possible to have respectful relations between the two groups. This very real landscape of Israel, as well as the world of academia, is only a background of this novel, however.  The basic story is about relationships between husbands and wives and children and parents.  However, after 556 pages of a slow but insightful read, I came away with an understanding of the people and the culture from the inside out.<br /><br />The main character is Rivlin, a semi-retired professor of Arabic studies.  He lives in a duplex apartment with his wife who he adores.  She's a judge and holds a prestigious position.  They have two grown sons.  One is in the Army; the other one lives in Paris where he has fled after his marriage broke up five years before.  The son has never told his father what happened to his marriage and the father is curious.  One of the themes of the book is how Rivlin tries to discover this secret.  Another theme is about a Arab female student who is working on her Master's degree and translating some Algerian works for the professor.  The book opens with Rivlin and his wife attending her wedding.  The theme of weddings and couples and marriages is returned to again and again. The individual human beings, both Arab and Jew, are all nice people, doing their best to simply live their lives in the complicated world in which they live.<br /><br />The book is told from the professor's point of view, a man of about my own age and I couldn't but help relate to some of the universal themes he introduces.  The politics of the region were present throughout although they always stayed in the background while the professor struggled with his own personal problems.  I liked this.  And I also liked the depth to which the author developed all the characters.  In the hands of a less skilled writer I might have been bored because I tend to like high adventure.  The adventure in this book, however,  was very subtle and had more to do with personal insights and self-discovery.  This is a good book.

The author, a young African American woman, tells some tales that seem deeply personal and yet are universal.  Her stories are peopled with young black Americans, all struggling with their identities.  Some of them are church going and dealing with their spiritual growth.  Others are college educated and dealing with their place in a white world.  One is living in Japan but the others are from Baltimore or Georgia.  All have a way of looking at the world that is unique to the black experience.  The reader meets a Brownie troop in Georgia, a young woman student at Yale struggling with her sexual identity and a young man whose father convinces him to go to the Million Man March in Washington.  We visit the bars and back streets of Baltimore.  We attend more than one church service.  And we get to know an innocent church girl searching for her mother and finding out more than she ever wanted to know about the sleazy side of life.<br /><br />Ms. Packer writes with an economy of words and a discerning eye for the telling detail.  She paints these short little slices of life with bright strokes, her words making real the world she describes.  I enjoyed each of her stories.  They were much too short, however.  And some of them didn't even seem finished.  Always, I wanted more but had to keep reminding myself that this is just her first book.  Hopefully, the next one will be a novel.	2004-04-16

The story is fine classic drama	Like the main character in the book, Amir, the author was brought up in Afghanistan in the peaceful 1970s. Later, as war tore apart his beloved country, he immigrated to the United States with his family.  This novel is set during these tumultuous times and gave me a full appreciation of the one particular Afghani family's  experience.  But this novel is much more than that.  The political setting is just the background.  The real story is a classic drama of sin and redemption, relationships between fathers and sons, and the impact of one very personal act of cowardice.<br /><br />Amir grows up in a privileged household, yearning for acceptance from his rather distant father.  Hassan is about his age, but Hassan is a servant in his house, of the Hazara ethnic group, and Asian in appearance.  This means that Amir, a Pashtan, can never really be his friend, even though they have common childhood experiences.<br /><br />A major local sport is kite flying and each year there is a huge kite competition is attended by the entire community.  Kite strings are covered with glue and glass and the idea is to cut the strings of competing kites.  Some young boys are kite runners, which mean they chase the fallen kites.  The most coveted kite of all is the last kite that is cut by the winner.  Competition is fierce and the kite flyer's hands are always cut and bloody from the sharpened kite strings.  But victory is something of a rite of passage and Amir is determined to win.  His young servant and childhood companion, Hassan, in an act of love and loyalty, runs after the last fallen kite and becomes the victim of a cruel act of violence.  Its aftermath changes their relationship forever.<br /><br />Later, we share Amir's journey to America and the fear and terror of traveling in a oil truck to escape the Russian army.  We see him grow up and watch his father struggle to adapt and learn how to make a living in the flea markets of California.  The years pass and Amir falls in love and marries and we see how strong his identity is to the Afghan culture is in his new American homeland.  And then, suddenly, in the summer of 2001, when he is in his late thirties, he is called back to Afghanistan and begins a dangerous adventure, which requires not only great physical courage.

The author is a war correspondent who has seen it all, especially in the Balkans.  And this novel gives him a chance to put some of his experiences into fictional form.  The result is a 179-page book that tells a grim and yet realistic story and put me right into the shoes of his main character.<br /><br />The book centers on one horrible act of violence.  Charlie Johnson, a war correspondent not unlike the author, is trying to get a story.  He's made a bad judgment though, and a woman who has sheltered him and his crew is put in danger.  She's set afire by a cruel officer and Charlie attempts to save her, burning his hands in the process.<br /><br />Charlie's hands heal but he is tortured by visions of the crime and he vows to find the man who committed the heartless act and kill him..  The rest of the book follows him in this quest and, along the way we get to meet the people in his life.  Etta, a woman from his office in England, makes a special trip to help him get through the first bad days.  Then his friend Jacek, a Polish cameraman, invites him to his own home for several weeks while he is healing and Charlie gets to experience the domestic bliss of Jacek and his wife, Magda, so different from his own wife Elizabeth.  Eventually, he goes home to England, only to realize that he doesn't belong there.  Soon, he is on a plane back to the Balkans, this time at his own expense.  Now, he's on a manhunt for the killer.<br /><br />This is quite a story and the writing kept me intrigued.  I learned about the way the war affected the journalist and I also got a sense of the Balkans and the difficult lives that the people lead.  As the book hurtled to its inevitable conclusion, I was left with a satisfactory story.  But I was also saddened by the sorrowful truths that exist in that part of the world.  The author is a good writer and, a student of human nature, which he brought into focus against the background of the reality of war in a distant land.  Recommended.	2004-03-23

Great!	I love true stories about adventures in faraway places.  And this fine book certainly meets that test.  Kelly James gives us a short introductory chapter in which she describes her upbringing on a ranch in the American northwest.  She was raised to ride and shoot and live with adventure.  Soon, she realized she didn't want to be relegated to a typical female role in life.  And so she became a private investigator and has traveled all over the world in a wide variety of international business investigations.  Mostly, she works in Africa and the book is comprised of four separate stories about a few unique assignments.<br /><br />Her writing style is fast-paced, breezy and has the sense of adventure that obviously drives her life.  There's not one boring sentence in the whole book and the action never stops.  I read these stories with the kind of attention that kept me breathless and turning the pages as something new happens on every page.  And my sense of wonder at her bravery and willingness to take risks never ceased.  I just couldn't stop reading  and was sorry when this 235-page book ended.<br /><br />In the first story she investigates a mysterious death of a wealthy plantation owner.  In the second story she travels into the depths of gorilla country.  In the third story she helps a young man visit his war-torn land.  And, in the last story, she is hired to investigate a young female African doctor's disappearance.  Often, she fines herself in  personal danger and has is forced to survive in a very hostile environment.  Each one of these stories kept my eyes glued to the page.  I couldn't put the book down until they were finished.<br /><br />\\"Dancing With the Witchdoctor\\" was a mini-adventure for me.  It brought me to places I've only dreamed of visiting and made me identify with the author's courage, stamina and sense of adventure.

It sure is the story of sugar.  I never realized what it took to get that sweet stuff to the table.  I also learned that sugar might be sweet but the lives of the thousands of people who have lived and died working in the sugar fields is bitter indeed.  At first it was all slave labor.  Later, in more In modern times they are not exactly \\"slaves\\", but they might as well be.  The work is backbreaking, the labor is intense and they live in wretched conditions with open sewers, no electricity, and overpriced goods, which they are forced to purchase at company stores.  The author, born in the Dominican Republic, knows his subject well.  He holds a doctorate in Latin American and Caribbean Cultures and has written several non-fiction books in his field.  This is his first novel.<br /><br />Through some unforgettable characters, Mr. Cambeira weaves a intriguing tale of love and murder and a way of life on the sugarcane plantation that is slowly changing, but not necessarily for the better.  The main character is a young girl named Azucar who is brutalized.  However, it was the other characters that won my heart.  I'll never forget her grandmother, Dona Fela, who loves her granddaughter deeply and yet performs a barbaric ritual that left me shocked and saddened.  Then there is Marcelo, the youngest son of the overseer who is very unlike his cruel father and brothers.  He chooses a lifestyle that makes him an outcast and yet he and the Canadian doctor who works for the international corporation which owns the plantation become instrumental in changing the path of young Azucar's life.  There are constant surprises with every turn of the page, which kept me reading long past my bedtime and made me think about the book as I went about my daily life.  And even though I thought the language was a bit flowery at times and there was a political undertone about globalization that was slightly preachy, the story was so good that it just kept me going.<br /><br />This is a fine book and should be required reading for anyone who wants to understand the role of sugar in the Caribbean.  But it is not a mere history lesson.  It is a rich tale of the many human beings whose lives intertwine in unexpected ways.  And it is an absolutely wonderful story.

I'm not a fan of science fiction, and so when my book group chose this book as its monthly selection to read, I was dubious.  But then I started reading this small, seemingly simple little book and I was hooked - completely.  Yes, it's science fiction.  Yes, it requires the reader to accept the reality of a world that is a figment of the author's imagination. Yes, it deals with censorship and book burning and the dangers of mindless feel-good entertainment.  And yes, it has a great plot and tells the fast paced story in a mere 165 pages.  But in this case, the total effect is much much more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />There's the quality of the writing first of all.  The words run across the page with searing intensity, pulling the reader into a world that feels real and creepy.  It pulsates with its theme, which is of fire and firemen and the cruel act of destroying books.  It's intelligent and literate and uses some direct quotes from revered thinkers.  And then there are some parts that were so humorous that I laughed out loud.  Every line resonates with tension.  It is a wonderful tale.  And, to top it all off, it is optimistic.<br /><br />One of the joys of reading this book is that we have the hindsight of understanding it was written in 1950.  The author has that that hindsight as well, and there are an additional 23 pages in the paperback edition, written by the author more than 50 years later.  These few pages add dimension to an already complete book and should not be missed.  I have no doubt that Fahrenheit 451 is now seared in my mind as being one of the finest books I've every read.  It gets my highest recommendation. Don't miss it!	2004-03-05

This historical novel is set in 1831 in England and the voice reminds me a bit of Dickens, especially in the use of  a narrator addressing \\"dear reader\\".  However, it is written through modern eyes inasmuch as it describes the horrors of the industrial revolution, the cholera epidemic and the medical conditions of the time.<br /><br />I was swept into the story and the deeply developed main characters and found I understood each one of their internal conflicts. This was a time of great poverty contrasted with great wealth.  The poor labored under inhumane conditions. And the art of medical science depended upon cadavers to study.  Hence, the doctors were turned into grave robbers, sometimes employing murderers to bring them bodies with no questions asked.<br /><br />Lodging houses were awful places where people slept 30 to a room on beds of straw.  Gustine is one of the lodgers.  She is 15 years old and labors all day in a pottery factory.  Later, she comes home and puts on a rented blue dress and goes on to the streets to sell her body in the world's oldest profession.  Another lodger, an ancient old crone, is employed to shadow Gustine's every step, to make sure she doesn't run off with the dress.  Dr. Henry Chiver is questing for knowledge of the human body that will ultimately serve humanity.  When he meets Gustine, the plot thickens as she helps him in his quest.  She doesn't want money from him though.  She has something else on her mind.<br /><br />There are many other characters too, all drawn with the expertise of a writer who really knows her craft.

Fine book!	Some books tell the story of people.  Other books tell the story of a place.  But this book tells the story of both.  Subtitled \\"The colorful history of booze, sex and death at a New Jersey tavern\\",  \\"Watering Hole\\"  is a mere 227 pages long, including about 50 photographs, but it tells a fascinating tale.  It's scrupulously researched too, with newspaper accounts of murders, mayhem and mine accidents going all the way back to the 1860s, when the Mine Hill Tavern was a stagecoach stop for weary travelers.  The iron mines that were there then have long since closed, but there were many a pint poured down the parched throats of the men who labored so hard in those mines.  Most were Irish immigrants, struggling to make ends meet, many of them drinking too much and too hard and beating their wives too much.  And there's a famous murder case from those days about one of those beatings that went too far.<br /><br />The tavern changed hands through the years, and was often tinged with scandal, such as the divorced man and the unmarried woman who ran the place in the 1920s, as well as the story of a seemingly happily married couple. Frank and Maddie who bought it in the 1960s.  It wasn't long though till Maddie started a gay relationship with the waitress, Frank moved out, and the two women continued to run the place as a gay bar till the late 90s.  This in itself made the bar unique.  It was 45 miles from New York City, in a small town in New Jersey, and yet it was a haven for gay people.  And, through the years, it witnessed both the gay rights movement and the devastation of AIDS.<br /><br />Later, it became an upscale restaurant, but that was shortly before 9-11, and the business never did well.  At the moment, the place is empty and waiting for the next chapter of its history to be written.<br /><br />The book is totally factual, with much of the material drawn from historical records and interviews.  Throughout, I could sense the author's delight as he unearthed yet another newspaper account or remembrance that rounded out the history of the place.  To his credit, there is a clear distinction between fact and myth.  And the result is that the little tavern in Morris Country, New Jersey, comes alive on the page.<br /><br />The Watering Hole is a small slice of life in a small town in a small state.  But the effort and obvious enjoyment that went into the writing of it is anything but small.  Hats off and applause to Matt Connor for bringing it to life!

This recent novel is set in 1932 in a fictional town near Fall River, Massachusetts.  The textile industry, which has been the backbone of the town's economy, has been dying slowly, the factories closing and moving to the South even before the depression hit.  Only three mills out of the original ten are left, and the difficult and tedious work is becoming harder as the workers' tasks are being increased.  Tensions are high between the various ethnic groups - specifically the French Canadians and the Irish.  They have to work together though, if they want a union.<br /><br />William Brennan, who introduced us to some memorable Irish working class people in his first book, \\"A Tattered Coat Upon a Stick\\", now expands his canvas as he skillfully brings to life the hard working people who, three generations earlier, had emigrated from Canada to work in the mills.  They, and the Irish consider themselves Americans now, and sensitive to the times.  They hear about the labor movement in Detroit and elsewhere, but are frightened that it might destroy their little industry, as well as their communities.  There's talk of a strike.  Leaders must be chosen.<br /><br />Yes, this is a tale of a time and a place in American history.  But it is mostly the story of people and that is the strength of the book.  I will long remember Annette St. Pierre, who works long hours, six days a week in the mill.  She's always exhausted and Sunday and holidays are the only time she has to wash her kitchen floor.  Her teenage daughter Clarisse is the smartest girl in her class, but what kind of future awaits her?  Clarisse is attracted to a fine Irish boy, the son of one of the labor union leaders, but the mill-owner's son is also interested in her, and he has a brand new car.  Then there's Arthur Mandeville, the best baseball player on the school team and the son of a union leader, who has been offered a chance at playing major-league ball.  Will he get his dream, or will he be pulled into the cycle of violence that is simmering in the town?  And will the union leaders themselves be able to put aside their differences and agree on the best plan of action?  The humanity of these people leaped of the pages.  They became real to me and I found myself thinking about them and worrying about them as I want about my own daily life..<br /><br />The Catholic Church also is central to the character of the book. I felt the deep faith of the people.  And I also felt the hard choices the parish priests had to make when the mill owners tried to influence them.  We see the contrasts of good and evil not only in the various factions in the town, but also in the Church itself.  There's a lot of thought provoking insight by the author on many levels.<br /><br />At only 186 pages long, this book is a fast read.  And yet it managed to bring an interesting historical period to light and let me meet some wonderful characters.  Definitely recommended.the cycle of violence that is simmering in the town?

However, she has targeted this book to a broader audience. Had I not seen her promote her book in a local bookstore I might not have had my interest piqued.  Also, my book discussion book selected this as its monthly choice and I was determined to read it even though, at first glance, some of the scientific diagrams seemed impossible to me as I have no background whatsoever in this area.<br /><br />Wisely, though, the book is constructed as a diary of her personal life as well as explanations of her work in a letter format.  She actually wrote these letters to her mother, and therefore I thought her descriptions would be simple. They weren't.  However, by pushing myself to read every word, even though much of the theory was difficult, I made a discovery.  All of a sudden I was introduced to concepts that I had never heard of before, no less understand.  Although I'll never remember the details, I learned about Einstein and the theory of relativity, how the topology of the earth makes it a lot more complex than a perfect sphere and what the concept of \\"infinite\\" really means. And, most important, I realized just how big our universe must be and how we humans are just a tiny part of it.<br /><br />As this is probably the only book I will ever read about the world of physics, I must thank the author for taking me on a journey to new and unexpected places in the small universe that is my own personal mind.  The book is not an easy read, but for anyone willing to explore new frontiers, I definitely recommend it.	2004-02-03

The author of this book is the editor of Newsweek International and a political analyst for ABC news.  He has a thorough knowledge of history, which he couples with his basic premise -- that democracy, in itself, is not necessarily the best form of government.  An excellent example of this is that Hitler was elected in a democratic election.  The book, which is really a long essay, gives us an overview of history and brings us right up to today's political scene with its emphasis on populism.  He wants us all to agree with his conclusion that democracy and good government are not necessarily the same thing.<br /><br />I learned a lot from this book, especially about the way that various governments work, but I'll likely not retain much of it because every word was targeted only to advance his particular point of view.  I agree up to a point.  Our world seems to be run by popularity polls that change from day to day.  And it seems obvious to me that when change in legislation is being debated, it is not in anyone's interest to have the public and media aware of every little detail.  This is because it is mostly the paid lobbyists and special interest groups that follow these public debates, and their agendas are often in direct conflict with the public good.<br /><br />Even though there were only 264 pages in this book, it was much too long.  Everything he had to say could have been condensed into a few dozen pages.  I suspect he's written articles about this topic and decided to expand them into a book.  Frankly, I was bored most of the time and struggled to finish it.  Therefore, I can only give it a mild recommendation.	2004-01-25

Recently translated into English, this novel by a French Canadian journalist brings the Rwandan holocaust to life in all its excruciating horror. It's also a love story as well as a history lesson.  It immediately set me right down in the midst of it all, introducing heroes and villains, as well as the vast majority of people who simply wanted to lead their lives in peace.  There's the inept United Nations peacekeepers led by a Canadian general whose presence was one of inaction.  There's the raging AIDS epidemic that is spreading at an alarming rate. There's the swimming pool at the luxury hotel where we meet expatriates, aid workers, prostitutes, hotel employees and guests.  But most of all, we are engaged in a romance between French journalist Bernard Valcourt and the beautiful waitress Gentille.<br />The politics of the Hutu-led massacre of the Tutsis was just beginning, supported by the police and militias.  The weapon of choice was the machete and the murders were cruel.  People were dying and nothing was being done.  Everyone lived in fear.  Against this backdrop, the couple planned their wedding.  I felt real emotion for all the characters.  And, by being introduced to individuals, I am beginning to understand the forces that led up to the horror. This makes the stories all the more awful.  And yet, life goes on, and eventually the fighting stops.<br />The book is simply written with a beautiful use of language and it is clear that the author loves and respects the Rwandan people.  It is not for everyone, however.  Many readers will not want to have their emotions churned so dramatically.  But for those who are willing to delve into this very human story and round out their understanding of this shameful event in recent history, I give &quot;A Sunday at the Pool in Kigali&quot; an extremely high recommendation.	2004-01-19

He concentrates on one infantry battalion in Vietnam, a student protest at the University of Wisconsin and President Johnson's decisions in Washington. It's a stirring narrative, woven together from hundreds of archival documents and interviews. Add to this the writer's skill in bringing to life each of the many real people in this unfolding drama and weaving it all together in an interconnected story that held me spellbound throughout its 528 pages.<br />We get to meet the soldiers and read excerpts from letters they sent home. There's Terry Allen Jr., the commander, whose father was a WW2 hero and who's struggling with marital problems.  There's Lt. Clark Welch who feels self confident and invincible.  There's Michael Arias, who carries the heavy radio through the jungle. There's Daniel Sikorski whose sister back home is having nightmares.  And then there is Vo Minh Triet, the Viet Cong commander who engaged the Americans in conflict. They eet in battle and we share the terror as well as the excruciating details of carnage and death.  Fifty eight Americans died that day and more than 60 were wounded.  And yet the truth was only known to the men in combat as the media accounts were based on deceptive spins of military and Washington politics.<br />We also get to meet the students, faculty and police officers in Madison Wisconsin.  We're there at a student protest against the Dow Chemical company recruiters on campus which led to nightsticks and head wounds and tear gas and a brick that severely injured a police officer. We hear accounts of the meetings of university officials and understand the hard choices that have to be made in a &quot;no-win&quot; situation. We meet young people who never had a political thought in their head who were radicalized that day.  And we also learn about the realities of napalm as well as &quot;agent orange&quot;. Then we jump into the present, visit with the survivors of that incredible time and take a visit to modern Vietnam with the author, visit the battlefield and meet some of the Viet Cong who lived through the battle. We again meet the student protestors, and talk with Paul Solgin, who tried to protect himself with his sheepskin coat from a beating with police nightsticks in 1967.  Later, he became Mayor of Madison and is now considered too conservative.  Some of the other protestors became radicals. Many them became teachers and professors. But everyone the author spoke to could look back at that month in 1967 as a turning point in their lives.<br />I loved this book and hold the deepest respect for the author and his depth of research.

But it is far more than that. It's the story of a world collapsing around her.  And it's also the story of some works of literature.  This adds depth and dimension to the experience of reading the book.<br />Ms. Nafisi is Iranian and spent her college years in America.  When she returned in 1979, there was a revolution going on.  There were arrests, executions and new restrictions for everyone, especially the women. At the time, Ms. Nafisi was teaching English literature at the University.  Later, she held clandestine classes in her home for a small group of women.  They would arrive wearing heavy veils but would remove them when they got inside.  And their discussions of literature often related to their own lives.<br />She describes exactly what it is like to live in a totalitarian society where punishments are cruel for even slight departures from the rules.  For example, one of her female students, along with four other female students visited a young male friend.  All the women were heavily veiled and the six young people were sitting around a table on someone's patio.  All of a sudden the police broke in and imprisoned the five women. They were medically checked for virginity and then each given 25 lashes before they were released a few days later. The charge was that they were not properly chaperoned.  The young man, of course, was not charged with anything.<br />By the 1980s there was a war with Iraq going on and by then Ms. Nafisi had two young children.  I really related to her as a mother as the bombs fell around her on a nightly basis and she would sit in the hallway near her children and escape into her world of books.  It is this love of books and the teaching of literature that is one of the many glues that hold the book together.  In one of her classrooms the book &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is put on trial.  In another classroom she discusses Henry James.  And, of course, her interpretation of &quot;Lolita&quot; is the centerpiece from which flows her strong discourse on the view of women, not only in Iran, but throughout history.<br />The best part of the book is that it thrust me right into the midst of the author's world.  It certainly wasn't pleasant.  But I applauded the way she coped with the inevitable and influenced others to deal with their circumstances. Ms. Nafisi loves her country and takes pride in her Persian heritage.  And yet she deplores that fact that in public the women there are forbidden to experience something as simple as being able to feel the wind and the sun on their skin -- a freedom I've always taken for granted.<br />Ms. Nafisi now lives in the United States with her husband and children.  I feel glad she escaped but yet understand her sorrow for her country.<br />This book is one of the best I've ever read.  It altered my perceptions as well as enriched my understanding of literature.  I loved it and give it my very highest recommendation.

After all, many years ago I had read this author's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, &quot;The Stone Diaries&quot; and enjoyed it immensely. But that was in another time in my life.  I was different then.  And so is &quot;Unless&quot;.<br />Ms. Shields is a skilled writer.  She knows that and perhaps that makes her show off her writing skill a little too much.  The main character is a writer too, and is obsessed with the meanings of words, the nuances of conversation, the unfolding of memories and how this is all tied up with feminism.  She gets so much into the analysis of it all that I soon got tired of thinking of her skill.  I wanted the good story that the plot seemed to promise.<br />The book is set in Toronto, where Reta Williams, a 44-year old writer, lives with her husband and three children on the outskirts of town.  Her oldest daughter is 19 years old and has chosen to leave the comfortable family home and spend all day sitting on the street begging for money with the word &quot;goodness&quot; on a sign around her neck.  At night she sleeps in a state hostel for the homeless and she doesn't speak at all.<br />What I found strange is that the young woman's parents and sisters go to visit her from time to time, sit silently with her, bring her food and warm blankets, but make no aggressive move to change the situation.  Instead, the protagonist feels bad about it and writes about it and worries about it.  And to keep herself getting obsessed about it, she starts to write a light fictional romance.<br />The author uses a lot of words to tell this story.  Much too many words.  I soon grew weary of this and couldn't wait to finish the book.  And even though the author ties it all together in the last few pages and everyone seems to be able to live happily every after, I just wasn't satisfied.<br />I recommend this book only if you're interested in a clever writing skill.  Otherwise, I don't think it's worth your time..	2003-12-19

Stewart '26 Series)	Books	5	17	18	N	N	Realities of the joys and absurdities of living in Siberia	From 1993 to 1995 Sharon Hudgins and her husband Tom lived and worked in post-Soviet Siberia, teaching at the university level through the University of Maryland's overseas programs.  Originally from Texas, they had formerly worked in Germany, Spain, Greece, Japan, Korea under the same program in which he taught economics and she taught cross-cultural communication.  Ms. Hudgins was particularly interested in Russia and her first master's degree was in Soviet-US relations. Both she and her husband had also learned the language, which made communication possible. This book is about the two years they spent in Siberia, specifically in Vladivostok and Irkutsk.<br />Ms. Hudgins' descriptions are rich with detail and the book is full of anecdotes that transported me immediately to the world she describes.  I had always heard about the inefficiencies and breakdowns that were common in Russia.  But after I read about their living conditions, the reality of it hit me immediately.  In both cities they lived in high-rise apartment buildings, a commute of 1-1/2 hours each way to their jobs.  These high rises were built with shoddy material and shoddy workmanship and were nowhere near food shopping or any other conveniences.  The elevator never worked and they would have to walk up and down eight floors.  But the worst thing of all was that heat, water and electricity were intermittent.  They would suddenly be without  heat in the middle of a Siberian winter.  And even when the undrinkable and polluted water did come through their pipes, it could be cut off at a moment's notice.  Same with electricity.  As a result, they learned to be very creative, especially in their preparation of meals.<br />Speaking of food, in addition to all Ms. Hudgins' other accomplishments, she is also a trained food writer.  And so her descriptions of food were some of the most memorable parts of the book.  She and her husband are experienced gourmet cooks and befriended some Russian people who were also good cooks.  There's a lot of interesting food descriptions and I was fascinated by the time and trouble they took to prepare even the simplest meal.<br />One incident in particular stays in my mind. They went out to countryside to buy fresh milk at a farmers' market. In this Siberian area the farmers milk their cows, fill a pail and leave it outside to freeze.  However, they put a branch of a tree upright in the pail.  Later, they lift the frozen milk out of the pail.  It now looks like a huge popsicle.  These &quot;popsicles&quot; are then loaded on a wagon and brought to market. The Hudgins purchased milk this way, carried it home on public transportation and it actually stayed frozen the whole time.  Naturally they had to boil it before they used it.  But they said it was delicious.<br />Another area which particularly interested me was the education system.  Formerly, it was all about privilege and favoritism.  People paid teachers for good grades.  Bribes were considered a fact of life.  And students themselves could never really understand the idea of plagiarism. But now that the Soviet era was over, this was gradually changing.<br />Yes, there were many challenges that the Hudgins had to meet.  But they did it all with a spirit of good will and adventure.  That's why this book was a pleasure to read.  It's only 295 pages long, but so dense with insights and information, that I purposely took my time reading it.<br />I definitely identified with the Hudgins and know my understanding of Siberia has certainly been enriched.

It starts in 1968 when Gogol Ganguli is born in a Boston suburb.  His mother, Ashima, misses her homeland terribly and there is an awkward distance between her and her husband as it had been an arranged marriage and they are just getting used to each other. Gogol's father, Ashoke, was in a terrible train accident in his youth and he feels his life was saved because he happened to be reading a book by the Russian author, Gogol. As the book develops we see how this name impacts the young boy's life as we watch him grow up in America.<br />When Gogol is a child, he and his class visit an historic graveyard and he realizes that this is not an Indian custom and that when he dies, he will have his body cremated instead of buried. Later, we watch him and his younger sister hate the infrequent trips to Calcutta with his parents. We share his romances as he goes to college and then out into the business world.  His family is delighted when he marries an Indian woman.  But all does not work out the way it was planned.<br />This is a simple book, tracing the life of this particular family and making their experience of adjusting to American life one of our own.  Somehow, the writer is able to put us into the skin of her characters as they go through the process of Americanization.  It is all so different from their roots.  And there are pitfalls and stumbles along the way.<br />The writer exhibits a mastery of using the perfect details to create a feeling that echoes throughout the novel.  There's a bittersweet sadness  as it chronicles a story that has been played out again and again -- loneliness for the old world and gradual assimilation into the new.<br />Jhumpa Lahiri's short stories won a Pulitzer Prize in 2000.  This is her first novel.  I found it wonderful and look forward to reading more of her work in the future.  Definitely recommended.	2003-11-30

This novel is the result of that interview and has become somewhat of an underground classic.<br />Written in the first person, it is only 108 pages long but it certainly packs a quite an impact.  The prose is clear, simple and melodic and the voice is haunting.  As Firdaus tells her story, I was moved by the sadness of her tale.  She was poor and unwanted, suffering from hunger and parental cruelty as a child.  Every man she ever met, from her father to her uncle to her many clients and lovers all treated her badly.  It seems part of the culture to abuse, mistreat and abandon women, and there is a sadness and acceptance of this situation throughout the book.<br />And yet Firdaus has courage.  Yes, she uses her body to escape poverty and a terrible arranged marriage.  And yes, she is able to get money from men.  But they all despise her.  And even when she gives up her life as a prostitute and goes to work in an office, she experiences the same kind of negative treatment from men.  The only difference is that she makes less money.<br />This woman's life is awful.  And I could well understand her desperate act. However, I find it hard to believe that all men could be such beasts.  Surely, even in Egypt, there is at least one man with a feeling of compassion or tenderness.  And I can't really believe that every woman is always a victim in every situation.  Of course the book reinforces my thankfulness of being born in a social culture where women do not lead a life of constant abuse.  But I have to wonder if the author went a little to far in making her point.<br />The book is certainly worth reading.  It does shed some light on the plight of women.  And the main character is sympathetic.  But just be aware that its political perspective overshadows the characterization.haracterization.	2003-11-08

This is the story of a young Bangladeshi woman who is sent to London as a bride. It is the late 1980s and she has to adapt to the challenges of an arranged marriage. It is a restricted world, of course, as she rarely leaves their tiny apartment and everyone she meets is alo immigrant from Bangladesh. She does adjust though, and we follow her life for the next dozen years, including the tragic death of one of her three children. We also observe  growing Islamic militancy  and the influence of Western culture on traditional values.<br />It is only after we get to know this woman from the inside out that a new character is introduced, a young man full of Islamic fervor.  By now it's 2001 and the whole community is affected by the events of 9/11.<br />We also get to see the infrequent letters she receives from her sister, who is still in Bangladesh.  There's a constant contrast between the two sisters, the one in Bangladesh having run away for a &quot;love marriage&quot; with horrible results.  She is cast out and alone and has to survive a factory job, then by selling her body, and later as a servant.  Life in Bangladesh is harsh.<br />One of the best things about this book is how the author can really get inside these two womens' minds.  One has accepted her fate.  The other has fought against it.  Both of them have different challenges.  And each of them is a product of her culture as well as the world around her. All her descriptions ring true and made me look at things in a new way.<br />The author knows her subject well.  She was born in Bangladesh and came to London as a child.  She's now married and has two children.  The photo on the flyleaf shows her in Western clothes.  As I read the book, I kept turning to the photo and thinking about the unique world that she describes, and how different it is from mine.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-11-07

Alma, her great-grandmother, was a madam in the 1930s in West Virginia.  Lettie, her  grandmother, who is now in her eighties, spent her girlhood in that house.  Now, all these years later, the talented Ms. Baggott has chosen to use this background.<br />The characters are all developed with the kind of quirky detail that characterizes all of the author's work.  And the setting certainly comes across as real.  I recently saw Ms. Baggott speak at a bookstore to promote her book, and I had to smile as she described how she did research by calling up her grandmother in the middle of one afternoon to ask about the prices charged for certain kinds services rendered to the men in 1932.<br />The story is not only about Alma, mother of three, who worked in a mill, was abandoned by her husband and then took up the world's oldest profession.  It's about the times she lived in, the reasons for her choices and the children she loved.  Along the way, we meet the women who work for her as well as a very special nun who has more in common with Alma that meets the eye.<br />The author has a great imagination and I know this was fiction, but I couldn't help thinking throughout about what was true and what was not.  Certainly, all the thoughts and feelings had to be created.  And the ending, which actually surprised me, seemed a bit too much of a shocker to have really happened that way.  But one of the strengths of the book was that I was constantly guessing.<br />As was Ms. Baggott's other two books, &quot;The Madam&quot; is a fast and enjoyable read.  Definitely recommended.	2003-10-27

So The Da Vinci Code was a real change of pace for me.  All I can say is &quot;WOW&quot;.  From the very first page I was absolutely captivated and found it impossible to put the book down.  Dan Brown is the master of suspense.  He knows just how to end each chapter with a cliffhanger.  Most of the book takes place during a 24-hour period and the story reads like one exciting roller coaster ride.<br />The subject is one that I know nothing about -- religious societies, secrets of Da Vinci's paintings and the search for the Holy Grail.  The author fed the reader the historical details at just the right moments to enrich the mystery, and as one preposterous thing after another happened to the main characters, I was always able to follow some of the complex puzzles that were constantly being uncovered.<br />The book starts with a murder.  And a secret to uncover.  There's a male historian who unwittingly gets involved.  And a highly intelligent female code breaker who just happens to be involved in the secret.  What follows next is a breathtaking race to prevent further violence.  And, at the same time, discover the a secret that has implications for the entire world.  Along the way, these two characters have to solve one puzzle after another.  I was totally caught up in the unraveling of this web, which was described so clearly that I never had to stop reading.<br />I loved this book.  It is so well paced and so interesting that it didn't even matter that almost no time was spent on character development.  Here, the plot was everything and a mini-escape from the world around us.  Just be prepared to schedule some time for reading.  Because once you start The Da Vinci Code, you won't want to stop. Highly recommended.	2003-10-17

I've always known that West Point was the place where Army officers were trained.  And I knew that tuition is free and competition is intense.  But until I read this book, that was all I knew.<br />In 1998, the author, David Lipsky, a reporter for Rolling Stone Magazine took on an assignment.  He was to follow a class of young West Point students through the four years of their training.  The result is an inside look at the institution, the Army officers who teach the young cadets, and the cadets themselves.  It's also a look at the forces of history, the changes West Point has gone through over the years and, most recently, the effect of 9/11 on the graduating class.<br />One of the points that the author brings out is that these young men and women are not only committed, but that they seem to be happier than students in other universities where there is a more relaxed atmosphere.  At West Point there's an emphasis on honor, character and leadership.  Standards are high.  The cadets are always striving and constantly under pressure to do the right thing -- whether it's the way they make their beds or how apply themselves to the honor system.  Infractions of the rules bring harsh penalties.  For example, a half-hour nap instead of going to class resulted in one young woman having to spend an extra year at the institution.  And a top student was expelled when drugs were found in his room.<br />I felt I got to know some of the people personally.  There's George Rush, a student who keeps making mistakes.  There's Major Hank Keirsey who takes the blame for one of his subordinates and damages his own career.  There's Christy Cicerelle who wakes early every morning to put on her makeup.  There's Huck Finn who came to West Point to play football and then finds he loves the military.  We follow this group to the mess halls, the physical training fields and the war games.  We watch them select their branches of the service and get assigned to various locations around the world.  And we watch them as they follow the news broadcasts after America was attacked on 9/11.<br />I learned a lot from this book.  And I feel I met an extraordinary group of people.  I admire their aspirations to the high standards set for them.  And I honor their commitment with pride.  Highly recommended.orld.

I hesitated to read this book because I knew it was going to be sad.  But then, I started reading it and in spite of the chills I felt throughout, I just couldn't put it down.  It's about a young girl named Susie, who was murdered in 1973 and is looking down from heaven and watching the impact on her family. It's written in the first person which made me identify with her immediately.  And, as the story continues, I had no problem in stepping out of my &quot;real&quot; world and entering Susie's as the story unfolds through her eyes.<br />Along the way, we meet them all:  her grief-stricken father who attempts to find the killer; her mother who can't handle the burden and runs away; her sister who tries to be strong, her 4-year old brother who is confused by it all; her flaky grandmother who holds the family together; the boy she kissed once and will forever yearn for and - last but not least -- her killer.  All these characters and the way they interact are described in simple prose.  And it always is in the voice of a 14-year old.<br />The clarity of the writing made me feel I was right up there in heaven with Susie, wanting to reach out and touch the people who were affected by this terrible tragedy.  She wants to live so badly and wants to reach out to her family.  But this course seems impossible. The writing is so clear and truthful though that I had no problem when it moved into that gray area of what is or what is not possible.  By then I was so captured by the narrative that I had just fallen into the story.<br />This book has received accolades from reviewers.  I totally agree.  There's magic in the writing and I give it one of my highest recommendations.  However, even though it is beautiful, it never stops being sad.	2003-10-03

It's about a recent ecological tragedy at the Salton Sea in southern California where more than 14,000 endangered brown pelicans died.  The heroine of the book, 25-year old Ava, volunteers to help out and while there goes through her kind of maturation.  She's half black, half Korean, and has been brought up by her rather quirky Korean single mother who was once a prostitute in Korea catering to black soldiers.  Her mother has always kept birds, and Ava has always had the misfortune to accidentally kill them.  Her mother keeps the bird feathers in a large scrapbook and documents all of Ava's bird-killing misdeeds.<br />It is only when Ava takes the step to drive the few hours to Salton Sea, that she finally gets to understand her mother, her background, and the fascinating and sorrow-filled world of the dying birds.  It's all captured well, in well-crafted words, and there's even a bit of Korean folklore.  Ava is a sympathetic character who was easy to identify with.  And, as the mother's story gradually unfolded, I was filled with horror as well as a new kind of understanding for the world of young women who are lured into the nightmare world of servicing men.<br />I was heartened to see Ava finally emerge from the shadow world of her history and find meaning in her life as well as love.  Mostly, though, I was glad to see her working side by side with her mother to help rescue birds.  In just 245 pages, the author has managed to do a lot.  No wonder this book has won the 2003 Bellwether prize for fiction has been lauded by such notables as Toni Morrison and Barbara Kingsolver.<br />I found the book wonderful.  And definitely recommend it.  I'm also looking forward to whatever Ms. Brandeis writes next.  She is clearly at the beginning of a long a distinguished career.	2003-09-25

Nancy Astley leaves home at the age of 18 to work as a dresser for Kitty Butler, a young music hall performer who dresses like a man for her act.  Nancy's in love with her and soon they're secret lovers.  Later, Nancy learns to dress as a man and pick up other men for money and is also cast into the world of a wealthy lesbian woman who uses Nancy as she would a boy toy. Eventually, Nancy finds true love, but only after the reader is taken with her on her many adventures through this shadow world.<br />The book is 472 pages, but I couldn't put it down.  I related to Nancy and her trials and tribulations and fascinated by the world the author created.  Somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew it existed.  But this book brought me right into its center, viewing the London's music halls and filthy streets as well as the opulent private clubs through Nancy's eyes. I felt her pain and admired  her feistiness as she rose above one obstacle after another. I also liked the fact that the romantic scenes were explicit and compelling.  Most of all though, I loved the story and the way the author told it.  Highly recommended.	2003-09-17

Great writing!	This memoir by James McManus is a lot more than simple story about Las Vegas and gambling.  He's a writer for Harper's magazine and, in the spring of 2000, was sent to Las Vegas to cover the annual World Series of Poker.  Not only did he cover the story, but he also participated and managed to make it to the very last table in this very competitive game.  While he was there, the trial of two people accused of murdering one of the heirs of the Binion family empire was going on, and he skillfully interweaves this story along with his experience of the tournament.  In addition, he writes about his own background as well as his present life, including his relationship with his wife and two young daughters who are at home in Chicago.  He's a fine writer and engaged me completely in his story.  And, as the book moved along I was holding my breath as he described every turn of the cards.<br />All the personal details about his life certainly enhanced the story.  I got to know James McManus well as he struggled with the &quot;good Jim&quot; and the &quot;bad Jim&quot; in his personality.  Not only did he share his background, but he also took  me  right with him into the clubs in Vegas where he indulged his curiosity as well as his libido in enjoying a lap dance.  The reader also shared all his mixed feelings about how much he should tell his wife about this.<br />The title refers to the card game itself.  &quot;Fifth Street&quot; is the name of the final card that is turned up in this version of the game. The first two cards are dealt face down and then everybody at the table watches with anticipation as the dealer turns up the next five. This final card can make or break a hand.  And for armchair travelers such as myself, reading this book was almost, but not quite, the next best thing to being there.  It took me little while to get all the nuances and I found myself re-reading the details of some of the more complex hands.  But once I got it, all I can say is WOW.<br />I really enjoyed this book.  And I learned a lot about poker too.  Highly recommended.really enjoyed this book.  And I learned a lot about poker too.  Highly recommended.	2003-09-05

Odelia Grey surely doesn't think of herself as a detective.  She's just a paralegal with a keen eye for research.  She's also a large sized woman who loves Girl Scout chocolate mint cookies.  This is the second of a series of mystery books in which she plays sleuth. The first book is called &quot;Too Big to Miss&quot; and the title is self-explanatory. I loved it.  The title of &quot;The Curse of the Holy Pail,&quot; however, needs a bit more explaining.<br />The mystery in this book is centered on lunch pail -- the kind of lunch pail that collectors pay big bucks for.  This particular one has brought misfortune to everyone who ever owned it.  And after Odelia does some paralegal work for a client and he winds up murdered, she's thrust into a mystery that totally involves her.<br />The mystery totally involved me too.  I found it hard to put the book down and spent many hours thinking about it and trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together as the plot twisted and turned, new characters emerged, and the complexity of the story deepened.  I found it fast paced, humorous and very real.  And I especially liked the office setting with all its petty politics.<br />Some of the characters from the first book are back too.  There's best friend Zee who's always advising Odelia to stay out of trouble.  There's her wheelchair-bound gentleman friend who wants to marry her.  There's a cat named Seamus and a dog named Wainwright.  There's also a theme throughout about acceptance. But mostly, it's about turning the pages just to find out what happens next.  Highly recommended.	2003-09-02

I had never heard of it however.  Maybe that's because it was written for children.  The lessons though, can be applied to adults, and, through the years, the book has received accolades from a large variety of people, both young and old.<br />The story centers around a young boy named Milo who is bored with his life.  One day, a phantom tollbooth appears in his room.  When he goes through the turnstile, he enters another reality.  He's suddenly thrust into an &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot; existence as he travels through a new and foreign land.  There's the world of words in &quot;Dictionopolis&quot; and the world of numbers in &quot;Digitopolis&quot;  There's the &quot;Valley of Sound&quot; and the &quot;Forest of Sight&quot; and the &quot;Foothills of Confusion&quot;.  Along the way he meets some strange characters as he bravely rises to the task of rescuing &quot;Rhyme and Reason.&quot;<br />By the end of the book, the boy comes home older and wiser.  And the reader has had the fun experience of smiling at the writer's cleverness as well as being reminded to appreciate things we take for granted such as our senses of sound and sight. After the first quarter of the book I was bored.  However, I am sure I missed a lot of the subtleties, which would become clear if I wanted to read the book again.<br />There are many valuable lessons to learn from this book.  And I'm glad I read it.  It's probably a great book for a 10-year old.  But I just can't recommend it to adults.	2003-08-27

I wasn't disappointed.  Ms. Allende is a fine storyteller.  It must have been difficult for her to weave the important elements of the two books together but it all fell together flawlessly.  Again, I was swept into the story, which starts out in San Francisco and moves back to Chile, where the saga or these characters first began.  The historical detail and the setting of time and place fascinated me.  And so did the development of the characters who sprung to life from the pages.<br />There's Aurora del Valle, the granddaughter of two very powerful women.  One is the heroine of the prior book, a woman who followed one love to California but found another.  And the other is the wealthy Paulina del Valle, a large woman whose business sense created a fortune for her family.  Both are very different and both love their granddaughter, who gradually learns the depth of their love as well as the family secrets.<br />There's tragedy in this book as well as romance.  There's war and peace.  And there are lots of contrasts between the places that are so well drawn that I felt I was actually living there.  There's also a resolution as we look forward to the future of the characters in 20th century.  Hopefully, the author will continue the story.  Recommended.	2003-07-31

He's romantic but very married and there are signs from the beginning that this is not a relationship made in heaven.  She's not planning on staying in Hong Kong though.  She's on her way to Shanghai, where she has contracted to teach English.  Here, she makes friends with the other teachers, and, after a bicycle accident in heavy traffic, she meets David, a young Chinese university student who yearns to go to America.  She also makes friends with several other teachers, one of whom competes with her for David's affection.<br />But this is not a simple story.  There's intrigue and high adventure as a plot forms to help David escape to Hong Kong.  And, later, when her teaching gig is up and Madeline moves to Hong Kong, the story gets even better.  It's a few years before the 1997 handover and the atmosphere is tense.  Hong Kong is expensive, and so Madeline moves to Lamma, one of the 257 islands and a 50-minute ferry ride away.  To Madeline it's a refuge, a state of mind and a stopping-off-place to rest.<br />But this is not only the story of one person.  It's the story of Hong Kong and Shanghai in the 1990s, a world that is rapidly changing.  Ms. Alexander captures essence of these places.  I felt I was right there, hearing the sounds, inhaling the smells, experiencing the tension of political and economic clashes. I don't know if I'll ever get a chance to travel there.  But I thank the author for giving me a chance to experience the voyage of the central character through her eyes.  I loved this book and was left yearning for more because it ends before the actual handover of Hong Kong to China begins.  But I'll long remember the descriptions of time and place and what it meant to be a woman during that turbulent decade.  Recommended.	2003-07-25

The book opens when Nelson Humbolt, a lowly lecturer at a midwestern university, is fired.  As he is crossing the quad, he has a freak accident.  His right index finger is severed.  When it is reattached, he discovers he has mysterious powers.  All this happens in the first few pages.  From there on, the rest of the book is an hilarious romp which pokes fun at postmodernism, feminism, affirmative action, tenure and everything else that makes up the stuff of what goes on in a university setting.  There are a lot of literary references and characters who are exaggerated so much as to become caricatures of themselves.  The situations are hilarious and even I, who don't particularly care for comedy, found myself laughing out loud in parts.  I can also understand how there is a lot of truth buried in the action. I loved the book until about the last eighth of the story.  That's when it went from the sublime to the ridiculous and depended on magic, and not on the characters, to bring it to a turning point. From there on, it was downhill all the way.<br />Those very well acquainted with academia and literature will adore this book.  Others will find it a funny and thoughtful satire.  I did enjoy it while I was reading it, but I have to stop short of a high recommendation.	2003-07-15

Desert Shield?  Desert Storm?  We saw it happening in front of our eyes on CNN.  But we only saw part of it.  Well, with this memoir written by an ex-marine who was still in his teens at the time, we get a taste of what it was really like.<br />Anthony Swofford's narrative moves back and forth through time.  He writes about his childhood in a military family.  He writes about a funeral for a buddy years after the war.  He writes about the sand and the fear and the camaraderie of the men.  But, most of all, this is a coming of age story.  And we get to know the brash and wisecracking young author by his macho posturing and one-upmanship in his story telling.  There's adolescent bravado of course.  And there's also a truth here that is rarely seen by the public.  This memoir is startlingly honest, the writing clear and sharp.  I found myself totally involved and just couldn't put the book down.<br />The author takes the reader right with him as he goes through boot camp, has his many exploits with women, competes with his fellow marines about everything and trains as a sniper.  He has to deal with his feelings about life and death and then experiences total terror when the bullets begin to fly.  Later, when the Iraqi corpses are strewn all over the desert, he does some serious thinking about the meaning of it all.<br />I particularly enjoyed the author's fresh young voice.  I felt I got to know him well.  He's too good a writer to not share his talent with the world and I look forward to reading more of his work.  Recommended.	2003-07-06

Formerly, he was a Colonel in the Iranian army, a man of power and prestige. But he and his family had to flee when the Shah was overthrown and his life has totally changed. He has a plan though. And this plan is to use the little money he has managed to save to purchase a small house at auction with the intent of fixing it up and re-selling it for a profit. It all seems so simple.<br />But life is never simple. And human beings are imperfect. And complex. The scene is set for conflict as the author, with craft and empathy, tells a story that grows in intensity and develops into a tragedy in the classic sense.<br />There are three main characters and we hear their voices from their own particular points of view.

There is Kathy Nicolo, who is evicted from her home, a place which gave her life a small form of stability. There is Sheriff Lester Burdon, whose marriage is in crisis and begins to romance Kathy.<br />The author leaves little time to ponder as the plot moves along at a breathtakingly fast pace. There are twists and turns and new developments on every page. And suddenly things were not quite what they seemed as the clash of wills and the clash of cultures leave little room but to erupt. There is one confrontation after another and each character's actions causes the story to spin out of control. Perhaps if these three people had never met, they could have each continued their lives in simple quiet desperation. But thrown together, explosion is inevitable.<br />The book is 364 pages long but seemed much shorter as I literally couldn't put it down and gobbled it up in as few reading sessions as possible. Days have passed since I finished it, but I still keep thinking about it. Highly recommended.ve passed since I finished it, but I still keep thinking about it. Highly recommended.	2003-06-28

Yes, the city was steeped in filth, buildings were shoddily constructed, and corruption was everywhere.  But there were jobs to be had, and to Ruth Dove, whose experience of the potato famine in Ireland is described in the most gruesome fashion, it is a place where the sight of feral pigs roving the streets and eating garbage reminds her that food is plentiful.<br />The book opens in the hot summer of 1863.  The Civil War is in full swing.  And President Lincoln has just called for a draft.  It seems that the draft only applies to the Catholic working class immigrants though.  That's because a man could buy his way out of the draft for $300, an exorbitant sum for most Irishmen who think that if the Union wins the war, the slaves will be freed and come north to take their jobs.  They also hate the class structure that keeps them struggling while the Protestants control the city, and grow rich selling substandard merchandise to the army.<br />The city seethes with unrest. Especially in the area in lower Manhattan known as Paradise Alley where the well-crafted cast of fictional characters have their own problems.<br />There are the women.  Ruth Dove is not only worried about her husband, a former slave, and their four mixed race children.  She's also heard that Dangerous Johnny Dolan is back in town after 14 years.  He's her former lover, a cruel criminal who saved her from starvation in Ireland, and constantly mistreated her, beating her bloody all the time and making her life with him in America a horror.  Then there is Deirdre, Johnny Dolan's sister, whose husband is already fighting in the War.  And Maddy, a prostitute whose lover is a writer for the New York Tribune.<br />There are the men:  Billy Dove, a former slave, who discovered that life as a freed man in New York is little better than slavery.  For a short time, he and Ruth were happy in the Negro Seneca Village settlement until it was destroyed to create what is now Central Park. Then there is Tom O'Kane, Deirdre's husband, a former fire fighter.  He's been wounded twice on the Civil War battlefields and has seen more than his share of death and destruction.  There's Herbert Willis Robinson, the writer, who cares more about writing the story than about the safety of his woman.  And then, larger than life is the character of Dangerous Johnny Dolan.<br />Each of these characters narrate chapters and so I got to meet each one of them individually and understand their various points of view.  This is a very human story here about love and death and social class and race relations and struggle and revenge.  But this is only part of the tale as it is set against the backdrop of real historical events.  The characters might be fictional.  But the draft riots really did happen.  Whole neighborhoods went up in flame.  African Americans were tortured and hung.  Policemen and soldiers were killed.  People fleeing burning buildings were shot.  And anyone who infuriated the raging mob was likely to die a horrible death.  It was awful.<br />Through the art of his fiction, the New York of 1863 came alive for me.  I found it all fascinating reading. Highly recommended.settlement until it was destroyed to create what is now Central Park. Then there is Tom O'Kane, Deirdre's husband, a former fire fighter.

And I learned quite a bit about Chile and the California gold rush in the process too.<br />A baby girl is left in a basket at a wealthy English home in Valparaiso.  She grows up privileged but is never sure of her roots.  At the age of 16 she falls in love.  It's 1849, gold has just been discovered in California, and Chileans can get there relatively quickly due to their location in western South America.  Her lover leaves.  And, several months later, with the help of a young Chinese man, she stows away in a ship with the intention of finding him.<br />During most of the book she is disguised as a boy as she searches for her lover over the next few years.  She experiences the horrors as well as the freedoms of a new kind of life.  And, as I followed her story, I felt I was right there with her, living in the rawness of this newfound world.  There's hunger and greed and illness and great natural beauty.  There are the sad sorrowful lives of the Chinese girls brought over as slaves for the brothels.  There's the hatred between the various ethnic groups.  And there's the background story of the Chinese man and his life in China.  I was intrigued by it all and sometimes disgusted but I couldn't stop reading.<br />This is a simple fast-paced story, full of adventure.  I loved it.	2003-05-30

It's a sad story.  And yet sometimes it's incredibly funny.  It's a unique worldview of his generation and also of his particular life.  First published in 2000, there's a 35-page preface to understanding the book.  And later, a 48-page addendum which includes some deleted scenes, some details about how true events were somewhat fictionalized, and an update on the author's life.  I read it all.  But mainly, it's the 437-page book itself that I found fascinating.<br />Jump inside a young man's mind as his mother lies suffering in the advanced stages of cancer on the living room couch.  Experience the excruciating details of her condition.  Feel the many emotions as he and his older his sister Beth care for their mother.  Beth has taken off a year from law school.  Dave has taken off from college.  Just five weeks before their father has died, also of cancer.  It's been hard on the family for quite a while.  Their older brother is off in the big world of career.  Their little brother Christopher, whose nickname is Toph, is about 9 or 10 and is in the basement watching television.<br />After their mother dies, Dave becomes his little brother's surrogate parent.  But Dave is only 22 at the time and acts like a kid himself.  They move to California where they play a lot of Frisbee and live in a rental apartment that is always a mess.  Their household might be unconventional, but there's no lack of love and Dave is obsessed with trying to keep everything as normal as possible for his brother.<br />With a few friends, Dave founds a magazine that's supposed to speak for his generation.  And much of the book is about this group of friends who try to make a statement about things like consumerism and politics and disaffected youth.  There are tragedies among his friends as well as lots of revisiting the details of his parents' deaths.  Words spill from this young writer like an open faucet.  It's like running a race at a breakneck speed and trying to read it all at once. The writer just picked me up and included me in his world.  There I was, racing along with him, totally involved in the details of his life and all his thought processes while somehow living inside his brain for a little while.<br />I couldn't put the book down.  And can't quite define its hold on me.  I'm not surprised that it has gripped other people too and made a success.  Certainly it's not for everyone.  But I loved it.

We meet her first at the age of eight in 1959 and watch her grow into young womanhood through 1970.  In seemingly simple words, the author gets right into the heart and soul of family life with a quirky mother, an alcoholic father, and three siblings - each one so clearly drawn that I felt I knew them all.  They live in rural Minnesota, in a world that sharply contrasts with my own life in New York City.  Her father and brother hunt for ducks and small animals, bringing them home for the family to butcher.  Her entire grade in high school has a total of only 18 boys, unlike the graduating class of more than a thousand here.  And she's always in her car, driving sixty or seventy miles to the nearest city.<br />If anyone had paid attention, Lillian's mother would probably be classified as bi-polar in today's psychological jargon. She has wild mood swings and is either elated about her latest project or contemplating suicide.  She has a slim trim body and shows it off in great home-sewn clothes, sometimes to the embarrassment of her children who she obviously loves like crazy and teaches to survive.  She's feisty and gritty and pathetic and complex.  And her presence drives the book.<br />Lillian is the quiet observer but easily led into a shoplifting spree with her best friend.  Later, she lives on Dexedrine just to get through the week at her secretarial job. I really related to this because I've been a secretary myself for a lifetime and it brought back all the details of working in an office in the 1960s - the electric typewriters, the carbon paper, the casual way everyone smoked cigarettes at their desk.<br />Each story ended with just enough closure to make me yearn for more. They built on each other and, by the time the book ended, I felt I knew Lillian, her family and what it must be like to live in Minnesota.  It was a great read.s a great read.	2003-05-17

Louise Erdich's latest novel has some wonderful characters, each one with his or her own horrific memories.  I found myself feeling all their emotional upheavals as they played out their lives in a small town in  North Dakota beginning in the 1920s.  The sense of place is wonderful.  But it's the people who are unforgettable.<br />There's Fidelis Waldvogel, a German butcher who has seen death and disaster in WW1.  And there's Eva, his wife, and their four sons.  There's Delphine, who we first meet doing a vaudeville act with Cyprian, a good looking man who can never me more than a platonic friend.  There's Roy Watzka, Delphine's father, the town drunk.  And Delphine's friend Clarisse the town undertaker.  And then there is the mysterious woman who roams the streets collecting junk.<br />They all have stories, and all have secrets.  And as their stories unravel I found myself drawn right into their little town with its rhythms and realities and disasters.  Their lives certainly aren't simple.  There's mystery and murder and natural disasters.  And just plain human weakness.  Time passes, the children grow.  WW2 looms.  The stories grow more complex.  Always they are fascinating and I found it hard to put the book down.  The author's descriptions of people and places are rich and dramatic.  She's a wonderful writer.<br />Some of the parts towards the end dragged.  Also, like life itself, not all of the threads of stories were ever completed.  Some questions raised went answered.  But then there was a surprise last chapter, which pulled a lot of the mystery together.  In spite of its few weakness, however, I loved the book and couldn't stop reading it.	2003-05-17

This 1958 novel was a complete surprise to me. I'd read three books by this author before and found them dark and introspective. But \\"Our Man in Havana\\" is a satirical spoof and I found myself giggling throughout. It deals with a theme that Greene has revisited on many occasions - that of a spy in a foreign country. But this time, it's all in fun, although between the 220 pages of this slim volume, he manages to say a few important things about social class, the Catholic Church, and the absurdity of international relations.<br />The hero of the story is Jim Wormold, a divorced vacuum cleaner salesman from England in pre-Castro Cuba. His 17-year-old daughter is growing up fast and he finds he needs money. So when the British Secret Service recruits him, he invents a whole world of secret agents and intrigues just to keep the money flowing. He is even sent a secretary, which introduces a bit of romance to the outrageous plot. All of a sudden, the lies he has invented seem to be coming true and the plot thickens, moving along at a breakneck pace. I was totally involved, and found myself laughing out loud at times. What a delightful read! Highly recommended.	2003-05-09

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions	Books	5	110	123	N	N	Beating the odds and living a constant adrenaline high!	This is a fast and explosive read.  It's a true story that's so high-powered that the tension never ceases and I was thrust into a roller coaster ride that kept my eyes glued to the pages.<br />The story is told through the eyes of the author, who met one of the students at a party and was so intrigued by his outrageous tale that he was compelled to put it into a book.  This is a story of a group of math whizzes, most of Asian descent, who used the art of card counting, worked as teams, and legally won as much as 4 million dollars during the few years they spent their weekends in the Vegas casinos, living the high life.<br />They strapped thousands of dollars to their bodies with Velcro to get the cash onto planes, used false names, and were always on the lookout for Las Vegas personnel who would sometimes personally escort them out of the casinos.  They also learned about the seediness of the gambling world, greed, the way the Vegas corporations work.  Of course they all went through changes.  And eventually, it had to come to an end.  Some of it is kind of scary too.  But mostly, it's about beating the odds and living with a constant adrenaline high.<br />Well, reading this book is an adrenaline high of it's own.  It put me right into the action and kept me there for the whole 257 pages.  I loved it.  And highly recommend it.	2003-05-03

He sees the American way of life as the best that the world has to offer.  A former policy analyst in Washington, and the author of several books, Mr. D'Souza is an immigrant himself.  He came here from India in the late seventies to go to college.  Since then he's become a citizen and has embraced all that is good about his chosen country.<br />He writes about how, if he had stayed in India, every detail of his life would have been structured.  In America he found the freedom to, as we often say here, \\"write his own life script\\".  As he describes it, in India he would be eating curry every day.  Here, he still eats curry, but he also eats fried chicken and pizza.  To him, America is the land of opportunity - and a way of life that provokes jealousy and hatred for various reasons.  The Europeans have watched their power decline over the last century.  The Asians would like to adopt western technology without the other aspects of American life.  And the Islamic fundamentals see it all corrupt and do not want a world in which there is a separation of religion and state.<br />Mr. D'Souza sure knows his history.  And he quotes extensively from philosophers and historians from many time periods.  He also is adept at the art of persuasion and makes a good case for some of the controversial issues he raises.  For example, he feels the legacy of British colonialism in India gave him the benefit of the English language and British law.  Gandhi knew that because of the British moral code, they never would have run over the people when they lay down on the railroad tracks during non-violent demonstrations. He tells us his grandfather was always fond of saying that if Hitler were in power in India instead of the Brits, Gandhi would have been a lampshade.<br />Slavery is another issue that Mr. D'Sousa writes about, an institution that had been present in the world since the very beginning.  He feels that African Americans are better off in America today than they would be if they lived in Africa.  He's even debated Jesse Jackson on this issue<br />With wit and clear thinking he takes on all the critics of America, from left wingers who believe that multiculturalism is the answer without understanding that most people want to become American, and right wingers such as Pat Buchanan who deplores the fact that the world has changed and is not the way he'd like it to be with structured beliefs about good and evil.<br />I loved this book and found myself nodding in agreement throughout. This is surely the clearest thinking I've encountered in my reading about America's place in the world since 9/11.  This book gets my highest recommendation and I urge both American's and non-Americans to read it.African Americans are better off in America today than they would be if they lived in Africa.

The winds of integration are in the air and the Old South is dying.  The story is told through several characters.  There's a pharmacist dying of leukemia who struggles with the diagnosis.  There's a elderly judge who's a former congressman who really believes that the confederate money hoarded in his attic will some day bring him riches.  There's the judge's grandson who sees changes coming.  And then there's a young blue-eyed Negro who tries to be accepted.<br />Carson McCullers is a master of setting the stage for this disturbing tale which is certainly not comfortable to read. Each of the characters is exaggerated but that is her intent.  She lays out the conflict with surgical precision and creates a world that doesn't exist any more. It's a brutal world and all the sugar coated Southern niceties just don't help. There's violence in the air.  I felt it coming throughout and hoped it wouldn't happen.  But the conclusion is inevitable.<br />Fine book.  Fine writing.  Recommended.	2003-04-26

Scobie is an English policeman and has been in the country for 15 years. He's married to Louise and their marriage is fading, their only child having died a few years before. The weather is hot and clammy, there is always a rat scampering around their house, they have to sleep under mosquito netting, and he has occasional bouts of malaria. As the story opens, he has just been overlooked for a promotion. But he really doesn't care. He still loves the place.<br />World War 2 is going on and one of his jobs is to check the incoming and outgoing ships for contraband. And there are always hard choices to make regarding right and wrong. There's his wife's desire to leave the country, an unscrupulous merchant and a young attractive widow. And, when he makes several foolish choices and his life spins out of control, he's troubled on a deep religious level. He's a Catholic and seriously believes in the teachings of the church.<br />This book transported me to a time and place that has always fascinated me. Once there, it brought me into the heart of the man. He is tortured by his own conscience. And I was able to understand it all. There's very little action in the book; it's all about his inner turmoil. I couldn't stop reading though, right down to the inevitable sad conclusion. The book is a bit of a masterpiece. I highly recommend it.	2003-04-19

It's only 155 pages long, but it's dense with ancient wisdom as the author has studied the classics well, and picks and chooses quotations to give us insight into current world politics.  It's all happened before in one way or another.  Nations have always been at war.  And the philosophers of the times have always interpreted them.<br />Over and over again, he displays his grasp of history to show us that humans don't really change, and the challenges of our own times have been met before.  There's Winston Churchill and Sun Tzu and Tiberius and Machiavelli and Thucydides and Hobbs and Livy.  These are names that I've only heard about and have never studied.  I can therefore not judge whether they are quoted out of context.  What I can see however, is the brilliant way the author weaves them all together and gives recommendations for the future.<br />There's a certain comfort in knowing that there is nothing new under the sun and that the sages have dealt with the theories of war and peace forever.  But there's also a lot of unease.  When I look at his discussion of the fall of the Roman Empire and the kind of complacency that existed in that world I cannot help but thinking about my own life of comfort.  It's not pleasant to think of the inevitability of change.  Kaplan, however, sees answers where I see only questions.  And his advice is to follow a policy of keeping strong and standing tall.  The Pagan ethos he talks about seem to make sense.<br />Even though some of the philosophical concepts the author used were a little hard to follow, he made his points well.  Mostly I agree.  But then it's easy to keep nodding my head in agreement as he quotes from philosophers that I have never studied.  It will be up to historians of the future to discover if he was right or wrong.  It sure would be nice to live a few hundred years.<br />Yes. I definitely recommend this book.

This book manages to capture, with tongue-in-cheek humor, the essence of modern American life. With a mastery of his craft, Jonathan Franzen brings it all to life -- from stock scams to cruise ships to pharmaceuticals to consumer culture to an idealization of Midwestern family life.  I found myself smiling at the way he used his words to convey the essence of it all.<br />But it's not his wry look at the foibles of our society that pulled me into the book.  And it's not even the plot, which is a simple one regarding a mother's wish to have her three adult children together with her at Christmas and all the personal dramas of each member of the family to make this happen.  What kept me awake each night, fighting sleep until I could read just a little bit more, were the wonderful, richly developed characters. They are all interesting, quirky and complex.  I hesitate using the word &quot;dysfunctional&quot; as it implies that perfection is actually possible and if only we could make the right &quot;corrections&quot;, we'd all live in an ideal world.  This is exactly the point the author is making though, as he gets into the heart and soul of what human beings are really and truly like.<br />We meet Edna and Alfred, the aging couple from a small town called St. Jude.  His bodily and mental functions are deteriorating.  She's denying it all.  We meet their son Chip, who has just lost his college teaching job because of an obsession with a student.  Their other son, Gary, is supposedly happily married and living the consumer's dream.  And their daughter Denise, divorced and a successful restaurateur, is in a rather non-conventional relationship.<br />But that's just the bare bones of who they are.  The author makes sure that we get into each of these character's skins.  I felt the tensions, heard the thoughts and saw the weaknesses.  I got inside their heads as they make their foolish choices.  I experienced their upsets.  I let the author's words wash over me and change me and, for a short time, I actually became each of them.  I found that fantastically exciting.

His cruelty and brutality could sentence people to disgrace, torture or death on a whim. His lust for power and women was insatiable, and a climate of fear was everywhere.  Mario Vargas Llosa, the prize winning Peruvian author knows his subject well.  And in this novel, he uses his best storytelling talents to recreate that harsh time in history when ruthlessness ruled.  The known facts are all there, re-interpreted by the author to facilitate our understanding of what it must have been like to live through those awful times. And the few fictional characters are there to help tell the story.<br />The story is told through three different viewpoints.  The first is set in the present day, when a middle-aged female attorney who has lived in the United States since the age of 14, returns to the Dominican Republic.  She's full of anger at her invalid father who was once an official in Trujillo's government, and it is only at the very end of the book that we understand why.  But as she meets her relatives and finally lets them hear her personal story, two other compelling narratives are taking place in alternating chapters which are set in 1961.<br />The reader gets a chance to see into the mind's eye of Rafael Trujillo himself.  He's 70 years old now.  Always immaculately well groomed, he's embarrassed by bouts of incontinence.  And he's also finding it difficult to consummate his erotic encounters with young women.  He's upset about these matters, but his mind is razor sharp, deeply involved in the political intrigues that are his forte, and able to force his underlings to shiver in terror at the whims of his disfavor.<br />And then there is a group of assassins, who we first meet as they wait in the darkness to ambush his car on a lonely road.  Each of these men has a good reason to hate the dictator.  Each has a sorrowful story and as each story unfolds, I was able to better understand the vast mosaic of the evil regime and its effects on their lives and those of their relatives.  I was horrified at the many acts of cruelty they had to endure.  And I found myself worrying about the safety of their families.<br />Then it happens.  We all knew it would.  After all, it's in all the history books.  Rafael Trujillo was assassinated.<br />But this is not a joyful conclusion.  The regime didn't fall.  And the punishments meted out to the perpetrators by Trujillo's son were the epitome of mercilessness.  I wish the story wasn't true.  It would be nice if I could think of it as a figment of the author's imagination.  But alas, that is not the case.<br />I literally couldn't put the book down and I devoured the author's words, letting them take me to the place he intended.  He brought me right into the Dominican Republic during those awful times and into the hearts and minds of the very real human beings who lived through it.  It was a voyage into the evil mind of Trujillo.  And it also gave me an understanding of the forces that shaped the Dominican Republic.

1178443:US	52294653	R2C9CP44NQ0ZAG	1586480499	467724921	War Is A Force That Gives Us Meaning	Books	5	42	46	N	N	Universal truths that I wish weren't so	Chris Hedges, the author of the book is a former war correspondent for The New York Times.  He's seen war up close in Latin America, the Balkans and the Middle East.  He looks back at those years as a time of his own intoxication with the great myth of war's appeal.  Indeed, it seems to give people a noble cause and a purpose for living.  Years after a war the participants often look back and remember never feeling so much alive as during those dangerous times, when their lives were one long adrenalin rush.<br />Nationalism is one of the plagues used by ruffian leaders to fire up the populace into hate.  There's a bonding and a glory.  The result is also devastating.  Lives are lost, culture is destroyed and people are murdered and tortured.  Yet, there is a seduction in the drum roll to this perverse conclusion. Later, memory is often distorted as its the winners who write history.  There are psychological reasons too, a connection between romance and death.  And it all happens again and again.<br />I was caught up the 185 pages of this well written book.  But yet, after each of the seven chapters, I had to put the book down and do something else.  I needed to get away from concepts that he was laying bare to the reader.  I needed to move out of the world of horror he created.  It's a complex book on many levels, because in spite of the many examples of unspeakable horrors, it seduces the reader too.  By the time I finished it I understood what he meant.<br />Although Mr. Hedges is not a pacifist, he has exposed the myths and lets us look clearly at what war is.  His perspective is fresh and clear and certainly made me think.  It saddened me too.  It's a universal truth that I wish wasn't so.  The words are easy to read but their effects have a lingering and troubling effect.  Not a pleasant read.  But highly recommended.	2003-03-28
1180591:US	52294653	R36F8RX7WHZC06	0316341118	537841158	Forever: A Novel	Books	4	61	62	N	N	Good history, but the characters just didn't come alive	This novel has a lot going for it.  It's by Pete Hamill, a New York City columnist who understands the gritty realities of the city and whose writing is clear and to the point.  It's therefore as much about the history of New York City as it is about the lead character.  The plot is unique too.  A young Irish man, Cormac O'Conner, comes to New York City in 1740 and is given eternal life - just as long as he doesn't leave the borough of Manhattan.  Well, that's a book I can relate to.  I live in Manhattan myself, and figure that even if I don't travel much, I do live in the best place in the world.  And so I expected to embrace this book completely.<br />At 613 pages, this is a novel to sink into. I looked forward to picking it up again every time I had to put it down.  There's a lot of action and colorful images and a true sense of New York City through the years.  There's love and war and a quest for revenge.  Obviously, the author did a lot of research.  However, he tried just a little too hard to make Cormac politically correct at all times, fighting injustice, particularly against African Americans, throughout the book.  And, just in case the reader forgets the fact that Cormac has eternal life, the author has him constantly reflecting on the history we have just seen him live through.  This is all right up to a point, but it's unnecessarily repetitive and often bogs down the story.<br />The book is strongest at its beginning and ending sections.  The beginning really gets into the life Cormac led in Ireland as well as his early years in New York.  And the last section, which incorporates the recent 9/11 tragedy into the narrative, is full of tension, especially since I knew it was coming and kept wondering how the author would have the story play out.  I did enjoy the book, but it was more from a point of view of &quot;isn't this interesting&quot; instead of getting deeply involved with a complex character.  Also, even though Cormac talks about the fact that he cannot leave Manhattan Island, it's mostly talk.  There is no plot development that seriously puts him on the brink of a bridge or tunnel or river landing with a decision about leaving Manhattan to make.<br />The book is an excellent review of New York City history as well as a narrative of both the Irish and the African American experience in this city. However, it lacks in making me really care about the characters.  However, I did find myself drawn back again and again to the book and wanting to find out what happens next.  I therefore do recommend it, especially for New York lovers with an interest in history.cannot leave Manhattan Island, it's mostly talk.

And he's still going strong.  In the first few weeks after 9-11, he was interviewed a lot about the event.  This small book consists of transcripts of these interviews and was rushed into print while the smoke was still settling over that big hole in the ground where the World Trade Center used to be.<br />There's nothing essentially new in these musings.  Chomsky believes that American imperialist interests are responsible for most of the ills of the world.  He feels that 9-11 was the result of a volcano of unrest that was just waiting to erupt.  There's a bit of \\"I told you so\\" in his analysis, and an attempt to weave it all together - Nicaragua, Vietnam, and the history of the world.  Some of it is understandable and I find myself nodding in agreement as he discusses the wars and turmoil that has always existed.  According to him, the only difference in what has been going on forever is that, for the first time, the victims are different. And because the victims are American, he feels he can blame the victims.  Well, not really the \\"victims\\"; it's the American government he targets.<br />He also warns against bombing Afghanistan.  He sees it as just playing into the perpetrators' hands because this will even give more fuel to the fire, make them hate us more and leave us open to more and more attacks.  His warnings and pronouncements seem gloomy indeed.  But are we supposed to do nothing?<br />I live in downtown New York.  I saw firsthand the horror of 9-11.  I smelled the burning fires for weeks.  And I've finally stopped looking for those tall twin towers, which used to be part of the landscape I saw every day.  I remember the photos of the victims posted on billboards and lampposts and the faces of despair on us all.  All those victims did was go to work one Tuesday morning.  They were just living their lives, not part of an international conspiracy - office workers and waiters, shopkeepers and fire fighters.  A lot of people died that day.  It was awful.<br />It is my understanding that every action has a reaction, a rippling effect that causes further reactions.  War and conquest has been going on even before the discovery of fire.  We're awfully naïve if we think that's going to change.  And yet, I applaud the idealist in Professor Chomsky.  He wants to change the world for the better.  That's what keeps him going.  And the book \\"9-11\\" is the latest of his efforts.<br />Do read it.  It's small and easy to follow.  It's a frightening perspective for the future.  And yet, there's an underlying message of hope.  Recommended.epers and fire fighters.  A lot of people died that day.

Brian Rouff, the author of this tightly constructed, fast paced novel set in Las Vegas really knows his craft.  I was not only swept into the story immediately, but once hooked, I couldn't put the book down. It's all about guy named Jimmy Delaney who owns a saloon in Las Vegas.  He's about to lose his business though, and has to come up with $50,000 fast. He's someone we all can identify with as he copes the best he can.  His style to keep cracking wisecracks.  The dialog sparkles and, as the tension deepened, I couldn't help laughing out loud at some of the jokes.<br />The characters are well drawn with just a few simple words and come alive on the page.  They're all people I've met somewhere along the way and each moves the story forward.  There's ongoing conflict with his ex-wife and ongoing love for his 7-year old daughter.  There's his seemingly upstanding brother-in-law accountant who has disappeared with all of his money.  There's an IRS agent with an agenda of his own, a cop friend who knows how to get information on anyone, and a homeless guy who hangs around the bar.  But most of all, there's the \\"Dice Angel\\", a middle-aged woman with a shady past who guarantees she can help Jimmy win at the craps table.<br />This book took my out of my own little world and plunked me down right in the middle of Las Vegas.  I got so caught up in Jimmy's predicament that I kept turning the pages faster and fast.  And, as the story sped through the Las Vegas casinos and then added even more complications, I literally could not put the book down.  I reached the arc in the story as I was traveling on a New York City bus moving slowly through snow filled streets.  When it came to my bus stop, I had just a few pages to go.  Believe it or not I stood on the street with icy slush all around me and finished it standing up. I read a lot, but this was a first for me.<br />This is Mr. Rouff's first book.  I am sure there will be more.  He's just has too much talent to let his finely tuned craftsmanship go to waste.  Highly recommended.tuned craftsmanship go to waste.  Highly recommended.	2003-03-16

The author, Henry Wiencek, is a northern journalist who specializes in old homes.  One day, when visiting an historic plantation in Virginia, the owner piqued the author's interest by telling him anecdotes and showing him historical records.  The author was fascinated and started doing research and interviewing the surviving members of the family, including the descendents of the slaves who had also taken the last name of Hairston, many of whom were related by blood.<br />This is not only the story of one particular family.  It is the story of America itself and the awful institution of slavery.  The white family members look back on it with anguish and never make any apology for it.  Historically though, there are letters and documents in which they try to justify it.  For example, at the beginning of the 19th Century one young white plantation owner visited England and wrote a letter about appalling conditions of the factory workers in London who lived in squalor compared to his well-treated slaves in Virginia.<br />During the 19th Century, most of the whites merely accepted the situation with the exception of one plantation owner in Mississippi.  When he died, he left his entire plantation to his daughter who was born to a slave woman.  Such a thing was unheard of at the time.  The case was delayed in the courts for years while the daughter and her mother were quickly sold.  The writer did a lot of research and finally traced the daughter, who wound up with a very interesting life of her own, even though she remained a slave.<br />Some of the stories of the Civil War were fascinating, especially the role of the former slaves who became soldiers in the Union Army.  In one particular battle in Mississippi, they fought so bravely that their Illinois white fellow soldiers risked their own lives to save them.  In another documented incident with northern soldiers, a white man was disciplined harshly for disrespecting one of the black men.  This kind of respect changed however.  The Buffalo Soldiers of WW2 were treated badly.  It was hard to read about how they were sent into battle by incompetent leaders.  The author interviewed one of these Buffalo Soldiers who was still alive and some of his stories are fascinating.<br />Another one of the living black descendents is Jester Hairston, who acted in the movie &quot;The Alamo&quot; with John Wayne.  He now is one of the most respected historians of slave music and travels around the country continuing his research and giving lectures.  Many of the former slaves settled near the Virginia plantation and opened businesses and sent their children to college.  Basically, they've done much better than the white plantation owners who just sold off one parcel of land after another until it was practically all gone.<br />The black Hairstons have a long-standing annual family reunion and the author joined them on several occasions.  Eventually, they all visited the still-standing plantation and met the white owner, who was honest in his understanding of what a horrible institution slavery was.  Eventually, they have made peace between them.<br />I loved this book.  It had great stories.  Wonderful authentic history.  And a fine theme about forgiveness.  I also felt I met some great people along the way.  Highly recommended.another documented incident with northern soldiers, a white man was disciplined harshly for disrespecting one of the black men.

However, most of these recollections go back thirty years. It's different now.  And that is the theme of this book by journalist David Lamb, who covered the Vietnam War as a young reporter in the late 1960s.  Then, in 1997, the Los Angeles Times sent him to Hanoi for four years.  This book is a result of his observations.<br />One of his remarkable discoveries is that in spite of the war, the Vietnamese people like Americans and he was treated well wherever he went.  Vietnam is now Communist, but it is not the same communism that was typical of the cold war and the Soviet Union.  Through the years, the hard line has softened, small businesses are thriving and the standard of living has improved.  And the younger generation finds it is not necessary to join the Communist party in order to get into school or get a job, which was formerly the case.<br />The history of Vietnam is long and sad.  Mostly, they were conquered by one country after another.  When the French moved out, the Americans moved in to South Vietnam.  They were trying to protect it from Communism but the people in the North really loved their leader and wanted to unify the country.  The war was bitter and more than one out of every ten Vietnamese died.  Then, after the War, the South Vietnamese were treated badly. They were sent to re-education camps for years and even when they came out, they could no longer get jobs.  There are interviews with South Vietnamese in the book and they have somehow reconciled themselves to this.  It is the younger generation who have the opportunities.<br />In the North, the people who fought are treated better.  The cemeteries are well kept and widows and mothers get a pension.  This is not true in the South.  Former North Vietnamese soldiers talked to the author about the will of the people to endure in order to win.  They are proud of the fact that they won and unified their country.<br />The younger generation of Vietnamese who fled after the war are coming back.  They have been educated in Australia or America, are taller and heavier their Vietnamese relatives, and speak English better than they do Vietnamese.  Life is hard for them in Vietnam and they have to adjust to constantly changing laws and a communist government, but they are starting new businesses and beginning to flourish.<br />This is an easy book to read.  The interviews are short and connected in a way that illustrates the realities of what Vietnam is today.  It is also Mr. Lamb's own story.  And that of some American Vietnam veterans who are now traveling back to this place which holds so many memories.  I've read several books about Vietnam.  Mostly, they were about the War.

Often, she appears on talk shows where she makes nasty comments about liberals.  She's an attorney too, and has learned how to research and document her position.  She believes it strongly and her passion for it spills over the pages of her book.  Whether it's true or her diatribe is justified is another matter. The examples she gives of liberal rhetoric from, most notably, The New York Times, among others, are all footnoted at the back of the book.  I haven't checked them out, but I do know that one looks hard enough, one can find documentation for almost anything.<br />The book decries the ways that liberals slander conservatives in the media.  But her invective against liberals could also be called slander.  She's smart and she knows it and is a master of using ridicule to make her points. I found some holes in her arguments, such as, after a computer search for the terms \\"far right extremist\\" and \\"far left extremist\\" she concluded that the term \\"far right extremist\\" was used much more often.  This doesn't seem to be a balanced search however.  The actual word \\"far left extremist\\" isn't really the term of choice when conservatives write about the left.  Aren't the terms more likely \\"tax-and-spend liberal\\", or \\"left-winger\\"?<br />Ms. Coulter uses sarcasm and mean-spirited comments to make her points.  And I found the book too long and quite repetitive.  It should have been no longer than a magazine article, but she stretched it into 205 pages.  But yet... I did enjoy some of it.  I particularly loved her chapter on books, where she talked about books that the liberal press had refused to publish such as Rush Limbaugh's best sellers.  And she made a point on her chapter on conservatives being called names rather than dealing with the issues.  But doesn't she realize that she's calling names too? Only she phrases them in the jargon of intellectual snobbery.  Sometimes she's amusing and I laughed out loud.  But other times there is just page after page of the same old stuff.  Also, because I'm not as familiar with some of the columnists and personalities she deals with daily in Washington, I was often bored.<br />I like to read books by people who are passionate about a topic.  And therefore I found it an enjoyable read.  But she made all her points in the introduction.  After that, it's just one long complaint about the way things are and the way she'd like them to be.  If you're very interested in the subtleties of political thinking and the various ways that the media insults conservatives, you might find this book mildly interesting.

This is a short book, in which he applauds the American ideal of democracy and deplores the liberal self-criticism that calls for blaming ourselves for all the problems in the world.  He's quite persuasive.  But yet, the entire book is just his opinion - an opinion for which he finds plenty of examples to support.  He's a man who sees the world in terms of black and white.  And he wants to convince you to follow him.<br />Mr. Bennett is angry and this comes through loud and clear.  He's angry that education, with its emphasis on multi-culturalism, is not the way it used to be. He's angry that a young college student, interviewed in Washington Square Park while the smell of the burning fires were still in the air, was more interested in pursuing his future career as a filmmaker than rushing off to join the military.  And he can't stand it that those intellectual elite college professors  who are former Vietnam War protesters, are preaching more about American misdeeds than they are about American accomplishments.<br />He views Islam as a threat because of its emphasis on killing unbelievers.  And he thinks Israel is right in all its choices.  When he bundles all this together with the heroism of the passengers aboard the flight that forced a crash in Pennsylvania rather than become a missile to target Washington, it brought tears to my eyes.<br />Mr. Bennett wanted to express his feelings.  And he did.  But he emphasized the extremes of both sides of the equations.  And not the wide variety of truths that lie someplace in the middle.  He says nothing new that hasn't been said before.  And even though he says it well, it's just another voice.  Another American who wants to say something that he thinks is important and wrote a book about it.<br />I spent a few hours reading the book.  I'm not sorry.  It's always worthwhile to experience a wide variety of points of view.  It's logically constructed and he writes with passion.  But unless you're like me, intent on reading everything about everything, it's not worth the trouble.s always worthwhile to experience a wide variety of points of view.

He loves to tell stories - stories of his childhood, stories of his travels, and stories of his observations of the human condition everywhere.  His distinctive voice comes through on the pages of this book.  It's thick with a Russian accent and there's always a buildup to a surprise ending.  Mostly, they uncover the tragedy that is so much a part of the human condition.<br />It's a short book, but I took my time reading it.  Each story was so full with meaning and left me so sad, that I had to stop, put the book down for a few days, and let the story haunt me for a little while.  Like a rich meal, only when it was fully digested could I go on to the next one.<br />It's obvious that Mr. Zubry loves the land of his birth; it's also obvious that he hated the government. His strongest stories take place in Russia - a child's eye view of a beautiful countryside and a loving family.  He was also surrounded by political corruption everywhere and the difficulties of life in his homeland.  He uses simple words, but brings the essence of life in the Soviet Union home to the reader.  I was glad he somehow escaped, but saddened for the people who still live there.<br />He's even more critical in his descriptions of life in Saudi Arabia, especially for non-Muslims such as himself.  Employed as an engineer, he was paid well for the work he did, but was always an outsider.  But even though he obviously was not happy there, and he writes scathingly of the government, he still had respect for some of the Saudi people he met along the way.  In one of his most heartwarming stories, he writes about some date trees.  And then there is a sad story about how a young Muslim boy is horribly misused.<br />He turns his skeptic's eye on the United States as well, and I couldn't help giggling at his observation of what one woman called \\"harassment\\" in the workplace.  And I also enjoyed his story about an eccentric neighbor.<br />In spite of some grammatically incorrect sentences and occasional spelling errors, I completely enjoyed the book.

Written in 1962, this is a fascinating history of the beginnings of WW1 and is the result of a vast amount of research.  It's all true, and all documented, and even though it's a dense read, the huge cast of characters springs to life.  This is the story of a war that changed the course of history.  And it's also a story of the men who make the war.  The reader gets to see the blunders and the madness and the personal feuds.  And the humanity of the imperfect human beings who make the decisions that result in slaughter.<br />There are maps in the book describing the battles.  There are also photographs.  But I must admit that I barely looked at the maps.  And I found all the photos of the elderly generals very similar.  What I did love though was the sweep of the story as well as the many details that go into waging a war.  Previously, most war books I've read had to do with the experience of the soldiers.  But this book is about the experience of making decisions, often based on folly.  And it opened my eyes to how vulnerable the ordinary person is to the whims of the generals and the forces of pure chance.  Ms. Tuchman also had a sense of irony and humor and sometimes I found myself laughing out loud.<br />The narrative of the month of August 1914 is described hour by hour.  Belgium has to make a decision to accept an awful defeat or willingly allow the Germans to march through their neutral territory.  There are alliances in place that are just waiting to be broken.  The Russians come into the war.  So do the British, even though it is with much  reluctance.  The basic war is between France and Germany, almost a continuation of the defeat the French suffered at the hands of the Germans during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870.<br />Before I read this book, I didn't know much about WW1.  Now I do.  It was a war that defined the breakdown of the European nobility and set the stage for the next war, which was even more horrific.  It taught me a lot, especially about how many people wind up dying because of the quest for power.  It saddened me too because this quest for power is basic.  So is the folly of mankind.  The only thing that has changed is technology.<br />This book is a masterful work.  It lays the groundwork for an understanding of the mechanics of war.  I might not remember all of the names of the generals or the battle plans.  But I will always remember the feeling of being right there, watching the decisions being made, marching for miles in spite of fatigue, handling the big guns, making courageous decisions that sometimes led to disaster.  And, especially, knowing that this is the true face of war.  Highly recommended.how many people wind up dying because of the quest for power.

A controversial world view	Noam Chomsky is a professor of linguistics at MIT and, over his lifetime, has become increasingly outspoken in left-wing views about American foreign policy.  This book is a compilation of transcripts of his question/answer discussions on college campuses and lecture halls between the years 1989 and 1999.  The focus is on the politics of power in general, and the United States Government and the media in particular.  His words are low-key and conversational and yet they carry a sharp sting as he reinterprets events over the past 35 years. In addition to the 401-pages of the book, there are 500 more pages of footnotes on the Internet.<br />I found the book fascinating reading.  My eyes stayed glued to the page and I found myself stopping often to think about his seemingly simple statements.  I learned a lot.  And some of it was hard to take because it made me look critically at my own view of the world and broke up many of my preconceived ideas.  If anything, he demonstrates that there are many sides to every question.  And I had never taken a careful look at his side before.<br />Most of it was easy to follow.  However, a lot had to do with economics, which I always find confusing.  I therefore have no idea whether his arguments on this topic are valid or not.  But when it comes to human nature, I'm an expert.  I understand the greed, the desire for power and the horrendous amount of death and destruction that has always existed.  I also understand the need to try to fight oppressive forces and make the world a better place to live.  This is what Professor Chomsky wants to happen.  He gives examples of progress we've made in the past that might have seemed impossible at another time.  For example, in 1790, it didn't seem that slavery would ever end.  And we've come a long way in the United States in the elimination of segregation and the advance of women's rights.  Environmental issues are also beginning to be addressed.  This gives Professor Chomsky's audiences hope.<br />But most of the book turned a flashlight on the horrors in the world.  And it bothers me that he blames it all on the United States.  Surely, the world's ills existed long before the Declaration of Independence was even formulated.  The American government, itself, is based on positive ideals.  Yes, we have been responsible for many misdeeds.  But where, but in America, would Professor Chomsky be able to be so outspoken in his criticism?  In some places of the world, he would be met with a firing squad instead of an audience who cherish his every word.<br />The book raised a lot of questions for me.  And, after careful reflection I can only say that I partially agree with some of his conclusions.  Some don't quite ring true.  And others just seem wrong.  The problem is that he seems to believe his conclusions first and then finds the facts to support his beliefs.  As I could never have the battery of facts at my fingertips to debate him, or the personality for debate, I cannot make any statements of the \\"truths\\" of his convictions.  That doesn't mean, however, that he didn't open my mind to new possibilities.<br />This book is certainly worth reading and I highly recommend it.  It engaged my mind and stimulated my thinking.  I don't believe there are easy answers and, in fact, neither does Professor Chomsky.  As a matter of fact he purposely refuses to give any concrete proposals for rectifying the situations he discusses.  Basically, he's just opening our minds.  And perhaps that is enough.e.<br />But most of the book turned a flashlight on the horrors in the world.  And it bothers me that he blames it all on the United States.

I'm not so sure any more.  I chose to read this fascinating book because I knew little, if anything, about the Sudan. I know a lot more now. And it's not very pleasant.  The author, Deborah Scoggins certainly knows this.  She's an American journalist who's won awards for her fine reporting.  And she's experienced firsthand the famines and frustrated attempts by aid workers who are often pawns of Sudanese politics, exacerbating the endemic horrors of the ongoing civil war.<br />Into this mix comes the true store of Emma McCune, a romantic British aid worker with a feisty personality and an attraction to African men.  It's the early 1990's and the idealist Emma tries to set up schools for the children of the warring tribes.  When she finds the young boys being kidnapped to fight in guerilla armies, she does what she can to bring attention to the problem which is just one of many that plague the country.  Eventually, she meets Reik Machar, a British-educated African leader of his people.  She marries him and gets swept up in the complicated intrigues and politics.  As she changes, she becomes a pragmatic apologist for the murders and tortures that her husband orchestrates.  Her tragic story is the center of the book.  This was a wise choice of the author, who even includes photos of Emma and her husband as well as some horrific images of the famine around her.<br />The book, however, is more than just Emma's story.  Scrupulously researched, it is the story of Africa itself, and the Sudan in particular.  There's the Islamic north with ties to Osama bin Laden.  There's the Animist and Christian south where oil has been discovered.  There are dozens of tribes with hatreds between them that go back for centuries.  There are the inefficiencies of the aid workers who mean well but wind up playing into the hands of the warlords.  There are the soldiers who steal the food meant for the famine victims.  There are children sold into slavery.  There are corpses lining the roads and being fed upon by vultures.  It's all very awful and hard to read about.  But then there is Emma's romance.  It ties the story together and kept me reading.<br />\\"Emma's War\\" is only 352 pages long.  The writing is clear, the chapters short and so well structured and interspersed with factual information that the learning experience is seamless.  There are maps and photographs as well as an additional 34 pages of footnotes.  It certainly left me with a lot more knowledge and insight into African politics than I ever imagined.  I enjoyed reading it immensely learned more than I thought I ever wanted to know.  It's an experience I won't soon forget.  Highly recommended.n sold into slavery.

1271168:US	52294653	R2CTFGQJNYBIKE	0743233026	597420896	Sin Killer (The Berrybender Narratives)	Books	5	30	32	N	N	A wild comedic ride up the Missouri River in 1832	Larry McMurtry is one of the best known western writers today.  He won a Pulitzer Prize for his \\"Lonesome Dove\\" trilogy and is also known for \\"Terms of Endearment\\" and \\"The Last Picture Show\\".  Now, he's taken on a big task - a four-novel series he calls \\"The Berrybender Narratives\\".  This book, \\"Sin Killer\\" is Book 1 and was just published in May of 2002.<br />A mere 300 pages long, it's a wild comedic ride with the Berrybender family in 1832.  They've come over from England and are on a boat making its way up the Missouri River. There's Lord Berrybender, his wife, his mistress, six of his 14 legitimate children, servants, guides, tutors, artists and a couple of Indian chiefs traveling home after being feted in Washington.  The family is rich and spoiled and totally clueless.  They meet a variety of tragedies but the writer presents it all as a farce, and I couldn't help laughing out loud at times.<br />Central to the plot is the oldest daughter, Tasmin.  She falls in love with an American God-fearing frontiersman named Jim Snow, nicknamed \\"Sin Killer\\" by the Indians.  Their romance is hilarious as are the other events in the book, as the many characters meet with accidents, violent death and love affairs.  Several of the women are held captive by the Indians, some of the men are caught in a snowstorm while out shooting buffalo, and the wild and wooly frontier itself plays a role in the story.  There are lots and lots of characters who romp across the pages, each with a distinctive personality, profession and passion.  I loved them all.<br />This is a fun book, not to be taken seriously.  It's just pure entertainment all the way and the action never stops.  I loved it.  And, since all the threads of the complex plot were certainly not tied together on the last page, I am eagerly awaiting Book 2.  I sure hope it's released soon because I can't wait to continue this very enjoyable saga.  Recommended.	2003-01-11

Woven together with a master's hand, this is the story of three women in three different time periods.  One of them is the legendary Virginia Woolf, whose writing style and introspection sets the mood. We learn at the beginning that she takes her own life it 1941, but her story takes place in 1923 as she begins to write \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".  The second story is set in the present and features the very modern middle-aged Clarissa Vaughn, who lives in my own familiar neighborhood in New York City. And then there is Laura Brown, living in a California suburb with her husband and young son in 1949.  These women have both nothing and everything in common, and, as they go about their lives on one particular June day with the hours stretching in front of them, a mood is created that sets the stage for the very satisfactory surprise ending.<br />The book is a mere 228 pages, and yet I had to read it slowly, putting it down every now and then and letting the images wash over me.  The author's words became the echoing chime of a bell, stirring my own memories and introducing a new perspective.  When a book can do all that it transcends being just a good story.  It is a work of art.  It's a troubling book, and not pleasant to read.  It deals with life and death and the hours of our lives.  And it sheds light upon it all.  Highly recommended.	2003-01-11

We root for the street-smart hero, who we learn early on is the illegitimate son of Howard Hughes.  The kid grows up tough with the grit and guts to confront power brokers and move up the ladder of high living.  Explicit bedroom scenes pepper the fast-moving narrative.  And the bad things our hero does are only for well-deserved revenge.  The true stories that legends are made of, such as Bugsy Siegel and the Flamingo, give the tale a ring of authenticity.  When there's lots money around, there's also lots of cheating, and I was fascinated by the many scams and cons from slot machines to high-stakes Baccarat.  The constant tension drove the plot, cumulating in a card game in the finale that had me holding my breath.<br />The book's 383 pages are easy reading and I gulped it down in two sittings.  I found it a pleasure to just relax and follow the story.  No deep thinking is required.  And I didn't learn anything new.  It was just pure pleasure.  Which is what reading for entertainment is all about.	2003-01-04

Every morning, Rujen Keju takes the 3-mile ferry ride from his home on Ebeye in the Marshall islands where he lives in squalor, to his job at the sewage plant at Kwajalein, the American-run island which is off-limits to him after the workday.  He's accepted this as his way of life, and his older teen-age son, Jebro, is supposed to start working there also after the weekend.  By the end of the day, however, he and his two sons come face to face with challenges, which will change their outlook forever.  It just happens to be Good Friday, 1981 and the symbolism of that day is one of the many intertwining themes in this novel by first-time author Robert Barclay.<br />Rujen encounters a series of mishaps that day, including having his work-boots stolen, and the reader is drawn into his story as he goes through the day, trying to conform to what is expected of him and looking forward to his volunteer job as an usher at the Catholic church later.  In the meantime, his son Jebro and his younger brother Nuke, set out on a small boat to visit the homeland of their grandfather, a small island which has been declared off-limits to Marshallese people.  To add another dimension to the story is the magical tale of mischief-making gods and demons appearing as characters who play tricks on each other.<br />The story is told through alternative chapters, turning a flashlight on one harsh reality after another as the characters struggle through their day.  And yet, there is sense of humor throughout, as we see each character's strengths, weaknesses, complexity and growth.  Everyone is breaking some sort of minor law, including three American teenagers who are cutting school and out fishing that day.  Their encounter with the two young brothers is both frightening and inspiring as they, too, learn a lot from the day's events.<br />I was immediately drawn into the writing and couldn't put it down.  I loved the characters and I loved the situation. I also gained understanding of the history as well as and myths and legends that define the Marshall Islanders as a people.  I usually don't like books that include magical characters, but these were so outrageous that they held my attention completely.  The author is great at description and he lets himself go really wild as he describes the demons.  Another theme throughout is scatological which addresses the very real issue of sewage management on the islands.  And then there are the themes of father and sons, and Good Friday suffering.  But best of all is the theme of love and camaraderie and lessons learned.<br />This book is a small gem that not only taught me a lot, but also made me think. Even the conclusion, which is indeed satisfactory, is something that gave me even more food for thought.  I hope to hear more about this author, who now lives on Hawaii.  His is fresh clear voice brings reveals some universal themes.  Highly recommended.ory as well as and myths and legends that define the Marshall Islanders as a people.

1293985:US	52294653	RCQTW0GWBNIYV	0300097662	439207641	Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat Responding to the Challenge	Books	4	16	22	N	N	Is this a modern version of "A Modest Proposal"?	In 1729 Jonathan Swift caused quite a stir with his satirical essay entitled \\"A Modest Proposal\\", in which he uses logic to propose eating children. Well, Alan Dershowitz's suggests something equally outrageous in this book.  He's a law professor and quite experienced at persuasive argumentation and pleading cases in front of juries. He also has a way with words and a forceful way of stating his case.  Problem is though, this book is not meant to be satirical. That's the problem.<br />In searching for the root causes of terrorism, the author discounts the easy answer of poverty or disfranchisement.  There are many peoples throughout the world who suffer in this in this way and yet they do not resort to attacking innocent civilians.<br />According to the author, terrorism works for one reason.  The world rewards it.<br />The first third of the book contains specific examples, mostly drawn from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. From the Munich Olympics to airplane hijackings, we see the terrorists gain more and more power.  Twenty pages are devoted to a timeline connecting a terrorist act with a specific gain, including having the Palestinian cause recognized by the U.N.  By the time I finished the chapter, I agreed that terrorism was an awful tool and something had to be done about it.  However, I knew that before I started the book.<br />As the author is a legal expert and also has a large team of young lawyers willing to research legal precedents, he weaves legal arguments throughout. This is what he is trained to do, of course - choose a position and then give lots of factual supporting documentation.  The reader is cast in the role of a jury.  Problem is there is no attorney on the opposite side presenting a different viewpoint.<br />But whether or not there is a precedent in law, I had no problem agreeing that we need to tighten control on our borders.  I can even see the reasons for having a national identity card.  Logically, he believes that vigorous debate can create the right compromise as to what information will be stored on the card, especially after open discussions.<br />In addition to this, he believes, that in certain situations, where the public safety is at great risk, a little torture can go a long way.  He gives examples of what totalitarian governments do and suggests we might adopt some of their techniques as a means to get information and also as a punishment.  He talks about ways this can be done legally with \\"torture warrants\\" in only the most extraordinary circumstances.  He talks about a sterilized needle under the fingernail, which would cause extreme non-lethal pain.  He specifically repeats the words \\"sterilized\\" and \\"non-lethal\\" as if this could make the act acceptable.<br />I'm not naïve.  I know this goes on all over the world. It's been done since human beings existed. It's done as a matter of course in Sri Lanka, Algeria, Africa and throughout the Middle East.  I even know that our government lets terrorist suspects be questioned in Jordan. I'm sure that they don't sterilize their needles in these places.  But that's not the point.<br />I recoil in horror.  Can this guy be for real?  This is America.  We don't do THAT here.  And I don't care if a million other countries find it effective.  I don't care if it can supposedly save lives.  I don't even care if it works.  This is wrong!<br />One of the things I liked best about the book was that it was provocative. It clearly put the problem of terrorism in front of his audience, and I do agree that it shouldn't be rewarded.  He has no real solution, of course. And I don't think we're likely to find any.  It's a very imperfect world out there. There are no easy answers.  I wonder if there are answers at all.<br />Do read this book.  And read other books too.  Learning as much as we can is a privilege we have right now.

Cote, the author of this biography of Aaron Burr's daughter certainly did meticulous research.  Add to that his skill as a storyteller, and this fascinating woman's short and sad life becomes real.  It's not just her story, however, that comes alive.  It is the story of the early days of America.  The author traces her roots back to the 13 colonies, adding to the background of this family and its place in history.  Living during those times meant living with medical problems and risking death from a wide variety of causes.  For example, two of Aaron Burr's relatives died as a result of smallpox vaccinations.<br />Aaron Burr, a vice president of the United States under Thomas Jefferson, is known primarily for his duel with Alexander Hamilton.  After that he fell into disfavor and had grandiose dreams of invading Mexico and making himself emperor. He later spent time in exile and finally returned to the United States to live to a ripe old age.<br />Burr had grand plans for his daughter Theodosia, his only child  born in 1783. Unlike the women in her generation, he had her educated as boys were then. By the time she was 11, she was studying classical literature and speaking French.  That's around the time her mother died and she took on the responsibility of running her father's New York home.  She was only 18 when she married Joseph Alston, a South Carolina planter.  Soon afterwards her son was born.  The birth, however, was a difficult one and for the rest of her life, she was in constant pain.<br />The book centers on the relationship between Aaron Burr and his daughter.  They were extremely close and their letters reveal that he even would write to her about his amorous adventures.  After her marriage, they visited often, usually for months at a time.  Transportation was difficult in those days.  It took weeks to travel from South Carolina to New York.  Even a sea voyage between these two places took five or six days. It was on one of those trips, when Theodosia was only 29 years old, sickly and mourning the recent death of her 10-year-old son from a fever, that she was lost at sea.  It was a tragedy whose mystery still haunts history.  There are rumors of pirates and her having to walk a plank.  But nothing was ever proved.<br />I loved this book, looked forward to picking it up each night.  It brought me to an age very different from the world we live in today. It was just as complex though, given the context of the times.  There were intrigues and war and disease.  And there was love and pain and loss.  I also felt I got to know both Aaron Burr and Theodosia as more than just historical figures.  And my understanding of American history sure was enriched.  I thank Mr. Cote for writing this book and making a major contribution by preserving this story.

Now, thirty years later, he has pulled together all his recollections, notes and collected data in this in-depth tome, fully 841 pages long.  Its physical weight alone meant that it was too heavy for me to carry around, and so I kept it at my bedside, reading only a few pages at a time each night and taking more than six months to finally finish it.  This gave me a chance to fully digest the impact of the thousands of details that make up his story, bringing me right into the heart of the action, and sharing his experience of the conflict as he was living it.<br />In 1968, during the Tet Offensive in the city of Hue, amidst the bombing and destruction, he found an abandoned kitten with a feisty personality.  To him, this symbolized the strong will of the North Vietnamese enemies.  He adopted the kitten who then shows up sporadically during the long narrative, always getting into trouble, attacking other cats and generally being a nuisance.  The author came to love this cat however, and the reader can sense the author's humanity in the way he cared for his pet.<br />The book is filled with hundreds of direct quotes from the men in the field, descriptions of day-to-day life in a war zone, the challenges of filming the war \\"up close\\" and getting the film to CBS on time for broadcast, the camaraderie and competition among the journalists, the physical discomfort of life in the field, compassion for the horrors experienced by both the soldiers and the Vietnamese people and the sharpened senses of knowing your life is always in danger.  There were several incidents of conflict between the journalists and military brass and an incident captured on film when some soldiers made their own choices rather than accept an unwise command.  There were also descriptions of drug and alcohol use, both among the men and the journalists, and some wild plane rides.  Underlying all this, the question of \\"why\\" was always there.<br />I felt I was right there with Mr. Laurence, throughout the book - observing the carnage and meeting the people, enjoying brief respites from the violence, and, most of all, bringing the story to the people back home as a witness to his times.  I learned facts in this book.  And felt emotion.  But, most of all, it made me think, and that is where the strength of this writing lies.  I give this book an extremely high recommendation.  It's a slow read.  But definitely worthwhile.<br />I felt I was right there with Mr. Laurence, throughout the book - observing the carnage and meeting the people, enjoying brief respites from the violence, and, most of all, bringing the story to the people back home as a witness to his times.

Through the years Ruth Rendell has proved her mastery of the \\"who done it\\" genre and this Inspector Wexford mystery, first published in 1975, is certainly true to form.  It's set in England, of course, amidst places whose names roll of the tongue with a British accent.  There's an unsolved murder in the first chapter, with a richly developed cast of characters surrounding the mystery.<br />There's a dead woman and her seemingly grief-stricken husband.  There's her mother-in-law who hates her and her husband's ex-wife who's known for making ugly scenes.  There are few clues also, as the house has been immaculately cleaned.  There's only one handprint, little to go on.  But then there is the wise Inspector Wexford.  He understands people well and has his suspicions.<br />The story unfolds quickly, as one clue after another comes to light and some new characters are introduced.  I was intrigued as I easily followed the plot.  The author is very clear in her intentions and I found myself identifying with the detective as he investigated the case, which wound up taking more than a year to solve.<br />It only took me a few hours to read the book, waking up in the middle of the night to finish what I had started that afternoon.  It was all one big puzzle, but the end put all the puzzle pieces together.  As I drifted off to sleep however, I was troubled.  The puzzle pieces fit, but the motivation just didn't seem strong enough for murder.  And so I woke early and re-read the last few pages, which included a surprise ending.  It was explained completely.  Problem is, I didn't believe it.<br />This is a good read and mystery fans will love it.  I did enjoy it as a few hours of entertainment.  I recommend it.  I'm just not a mystery fan though.	2002-11-30

And the writer's passion for the story	I love to learn new things.  That's why this 1998 book by journalist Susan Orlean appealed to me.  It's about orchids. And one particular eccentric man with a scheme to grow rich from Florida's endangered Ghost Orchid.  But mostly, it's about the passion surrounding the special world of the orchid lover.  And, also, it's about the writer's own passion for a good story.<br />On a visit to Florida, Ms. Orleans just happened to see a small article in the local newspaper about John Laroche, accused of stealing orchids from the Fakahatchee Swamp.  On a whim, she went to the trial, became interested in the subject and, with a sense of humor and a great way with words, she takes the reader on her own journey of discovery. I love Ms. Orleans' writing.  For example, she describes John Laroche as having &quot;the posture of al dente spaghetti&quot; and &quot;the bulk and shape of a coat hanger&quot;.<br />I identified with the writer's experience completely.  I was right with her as she explored the hot mucky swamps. And I listened with her ears as she interviewed collectors, business people and law enforcement agents.  I learned about the Seminole Indians and their own particular story.  I learned a lot of orchid history dating back hundreds of years which included a whole cast of European plunderers, smugglers and naturalists. And  I learned about Florida, with all its beauty and land grabbing and swamps and personalities.  A lot of research went into this book.  It's full of facts and figures as well as the writer's personal observations. It certainly taught me a lot. It even drove me to the Internet to find out when the next orchid show will be in New York.  I know I'll be there.<br />I loved this book and give it an extremely high recommendation.  It certainly opened a whole new world for me.	2002-11-23

That's why I was so captivated by this recent novel by Michael Ondaatje, author of \\"The English Patient\\", and native to this war-torn land.  Even though he now lives in Canada, it's obvious he loves his homeland and is saddened by the sorrow it went though during the 1980s.<br />Using language of poetic beauty, he introduces the reader to his lead character, Anil Tissera.  Born and raised in Sri Lanka, she left the country as a young woman to study in England.  Trained as a forensic anthropologist, she also lived in the Arizona, working in the local morgue.  Later, she worked in Central America, digging up graves and identifying the remains.  Now in her thirties, she is sent to Sri Lanka to investigate the horror that has swept her country.  It is not an easy job.  And it is not easy to read about.<br />Mr. Ondaatje wisely stays away from the actual political details of the conflict.  He never lays blame on any one group and never specifically identifies them.  It was only later that I discovered that the war involved complex issues between Hindus and Buddhists as well as a variety of corrupt government military forces. Each group is passionately dedicated to its cause, and each one keeps murdering and being murdered.  People are disappearing.  The country is in turmoil.  And human remains show up that need to be identified.  So when Anil comes to Sri Lanka, it is not only memories of the beautiful land and her childhood she has to revisit.  She has to get down to work to the nitty-gritty business of identifying skeletons.  And the reader goes right along with her, learning about the details of her craft as well as the political intrigue that makes it practically impossible to trust anyone.<br />Along the way we meet the other characters.  There's the archeologist she's assigned to work with.  There's his doctor brother.  There's a villager who works in the mine and who also has the technical skill to rebuild the face of a skeleton.  There's a middle-class doctor who is captured in order to serve one of the rebel groups.  There's an elderly blind archeologist with a lifetime of learning and insight.  And there is Sri Lanka itself, with all its natural beauty, which is plunged into a bloodbath that is totally out of control.<br />The book is disturbing and brilliant and sometimes rambling.  I learned more than I ever wanted to know about the different kinds of physical effects that death and torture have on a body.  And, in spite of having to take a deep breath and steeling myself for what I knew I would be reading about every time I picked up the book, I found myself completely involved and always fascinated.

Born in 1969, her early childhood was spent in sweltering hot Rhodesia, where her parents slept with guns next to their bed, and her father was often away, fighting with other white men against the guerillas who eventually won the war.  Her parents were poor, life was brutal and harsh, and the climate was always sticky and uncomfortable. And yet, this is a tale laced with humor as she casts her child's eye view at the many disruptions and disappointments of her family's life as they moved from Rhodesia to Malawi and then to Zambia.<br />Ms. Fuller's world was full of hot sweaty days, hard work, mosquitoes and ticks and snakes.  There's only occasional electricity, drinking water is foul, and any kind of plumbing is a luxury.  But there's always beer and alcohol, and lots of cigarettes, all of which is taken for granted as a way of life by her and her sister, the two surviving siblings out of five.  I couldn't help thinking about my own children and their easy life here in New York, as I looked at the photographs throughout the book as the two young girls grew up and the parents grew wrinkled and gray.  I love the writer's descriptions and the way she uses words.  The children sing songs about fighting through \\"thickandthin\\" and the family camps with other \\"expats-like-us\\".  Young Alexandra, nicknamed \\"Bobo\\" learns to clean, load and shoot a gun.  Her father chain smokes cigarettes as he drives their Land Rover over inhospitable roads.  Her mother loves animals and keeps packs of dogs around in a losing battle to control their fleas.  The children attend boarding schools that change in racial composition as the politics change.  And yet there's never a single word of self pity in spite of failing crops and ramshackle living conditions.<br />I loved this book and read it fast, enjoying Ms. Fuller's voice.  The Africa she describes became real to me as I let myself plunge into her world for a little while.  There was an excellent map which helped me locate the places she describes as well as the family snapshots.  Most of all though, there was a sense throughout of what it really felt like to be that little girl who grew up to share her memories with her readers.  I thank her for doing that and give this book one of my highest recommendations.  Read it.  It's a real treat!me as I let myself plunge into her world for a little while.

Little did she know then that the strike would last for eighteen months, and that this book would be a natural outgrowth of her interest.  The book is filled with facts and figures as well as the stories of people who bravely \\"held the line\\" each day, picketing against the \\"scab\\" workers that were brought in by the Phelps Dodge Copper Corporation.  It's also the story of a town, where the only work was in the mine.  And it's also about the generations of Mexican American citizens of that town who had to fight prejudice as well as the everyday dangers inherent in mining.<br />Most of all though, it is the story of the women and how this strike broadened their understanding of the world beyond their families, and let them develop new strengths.  For it was mostly the women who stood on that picket line - the wives, sisters and mothers of the men who would have been arrested.  Families were threatened with eviction.  There was even a catastrophic flood during this time, which brought its own kind of devastation.  And some of the women were arrested too.  But despite intimidation, tear gas and harassment, the community stood firm.<br />I was particularly interested in the stories of the handful of women who actually worked in the mine.  One of them had 11 children but needed the work to be able to help her husband support the family. Eight dollars an hour doesn't seem like much, but it was considered a good wage compared with $3.00 an hour for being a secretary.  Several of them described the actual work, including the heavy lifting all day long and sometimes working as many as 28 days in a row.  Their male co-workers verbally harassed them.  And there was no special restroom for women.  Eventually though, they won respect.<br />But when the corporation wanted to cut wages and eliminate even a cost-of-living increase, the strike started.  It went on and on.  Ms. Kingsolver goes into all the details.  It was fascinating.  It was if I was just picked up from my New York City apartment and plunked down on the picket line of a little town that had less people than one apartment building on my block.<br />The eventual result wasn't very good for anybody though. Not in the usual sense.  But by the time the author gives her own spin on the situation, including her feminist politics, I was left with a positive feeling, as was her intention.  I learned things from this book.  I learned about a copper mine in Arizona, the actual jobs and the people who worked there.  I learned about the large and imperfect system of unions in this country.  And, most of all, I learned about the strength and courage of a few special women.Kingsolver goes into all the details.

That's how Maple, the first person narrator, met Wild Ginger.  Together they fought the class bully, and together they studied Maoism.  Wild Ginger, however, whose father was a foreigner, had a harder time than Maple.  But the abuse she endured even pulled her more strongly  into Maoism.  Eventually she rose in the party.  And when a young man developed a romantic interest in her, a triangle developed that included her friend Maple.  That's when the events take a more tragic turn.<br />From the very first page, I was immediately swept up in the story, which was set against the background of the horrors of Maoism.  Here was history come alive through the eyes of the people, each one so beautifully developed that even the minor characters became unique individuals.  There is not a wasted word and the tightly crafted sentences, juxtaposed with quotations from Mao's writings, brought me right into the heart of China.  I felt the political fervor as well as the frustrations and depravations of living through that unique time.<br />I loved this book.  I read it quickly, and had a hard time putting it down.  Highly recommended.	2002-10-26

Subtitled \\"Life After Communism\\", this is a collection of articles by Slavenka Drakulic, a Croatian journalist who has become a spokesperson to the West about life in Eastern Europe.  Raised in the 1950s, she grew up in a tightly controlled world under communism.  She's a product of that system as well as a witness to all the changes that have occurred in her world.  Privileged because of her many trips to Western Europe, and married to a Swedish journalist, she has a unique perspective which she shares on the pages of this short but very eye-opening book.  I was so intrigued that I read it all at one sitting and rushed to my computer to print out a map of the Balkans so that I could see for myself where the places were.<br />Her native land of Croatia has gone through many changes recently and yearns to be considered part of Western Europe.  Several cafes have opened called \\"Caf&eacute; Europa\\" which try to imitate those in Vienna.  But the coffee is served in heavy utilitarian cups and the pastries lack the taste and delicacy of what can be found just a few miles, but yet a world away in Austria.  Ms. Drakulic writes with humor and as well as irony and passion as she discusses this and other aspects of life in her part of the world.  Such as that it is impossible it is to find a clean toilet, equipped with soap, toilet paper and running water anywhere in Bucharest, the capital of Romania.<br />There are the constant humiliations of having to cross borders and have to show her Croatian passport.  And the way she and other Eastern Europeans are distrusted reach farther than just the border crossings.  She talks about consumer goods and how she and others constantly have to smuggle them across the border.  One especially interesting story is how she and her husband argued about whether to smuggle a vacuum cleaner to Croatia or be willing to buy it at home and pay an inflated price.<br />She travels a lot and picks up details of the character of a place.  For example, when she visits Sofia, which is the capital of Bulgaria, she is very aware that nobody smiles.  To smile, in that culture, is perceived as a sign of subservience and weakness.  This is just the opposite in the United States, where everyone smiles and thanks you for your business even though a phrase like \\"how are you today\\" doesn't mean that anybody cares.  She also was impressed with the way that Americans value their perfect and well-kept teeth.  When she returned to Croatia, she looked at the teeth of her fellow Croatians and discovered that many people had missing or rotten teeth.  Even the people who could afford dental care didn't get it.  It just wasn't important to them.<br />But have no allusions. This book is not just about these rather enlightening cross-cultural social discoveries.  She goes deeply into the history of Croatia and the war crimes during WW2.  And her trip to Israel and how she was constantly asked about whether or not she carried any guilt even though she was born after the War.  She talks about an interview by another journalist with a former concentration camp commander who is living in Argentina.  Ms. Drakulic is angry because the other journalist never made him answer any hard questions or confront him with his crimes.<br />She also discusses the Muslims of the area and ethnic cleansing.  And she talks about Tito and other dictators and how so many people feel displaced by all this new freedom and yearn for a return to communism.<br />I really learned a lot from this book even though I wasn't familiar with all the names of the political figures. It made me want to learn more. And I plan on doing just that.  This is a great beginning though.  And, even if I never get a chance to read any more about this area, it certainly made me understand and appreciate the Eastern European world and some of its contradictions and complexities.  And she did this all in a mere 213 pages.<br />I highly recommend this book for everybody.  Read it.  It will gently and firmly open your eyes to this very interesting part of the world.ntly and firmly open your eyes to this very interesting part of the world.	2002-10-19

Her stories are set in the small southern towns that she knows so well, and she is known for her character portrayal.  This book, which is my first experience with her work, is no exception.  The stories are short and full of meaning.  Some are simple and some border on the horrific.  But all of them leave a lasting impression, causing me to ponder their meaning.  The characters are well developed.  There is no doubt that Ms. Welty is a master of her craft.<br />It's true that the people come alive right off the pages.  Only problem is that I just didn't like any of them.  Each story presents some sort of a puzzle.  She packs them with great imagery and wonderful details.  I found myself getting involved in reading them.  And then, when the story ended, there was a lingering question. What had happened?  I was always left with an uncomfortable feeling.  And left wondering.<br />I am sure that this ambiguity was the writer's intention.  And I do applaud her skill.  I'm glad I had the experience of reading her work.  I just don't want to read any more of it.	2002-10-12

Isolated by geography and culture, the reader learns about the Holy Rollers and their snake handling religion, and meets some interesting and well-developed characters.<br />Ms. Nahai weaves a wonderful tale, full of passion and seduction as well as sadness and brutality. There is suffering and also love.  And an acceptance of the forces of religion to shape lives.  The story moves fast and I couldn't stop reading, enjoying the quality of her writing as much as I wanted to know what would happen next.<br />I was disappointed however.  No matter how rich the description or how hard the author tried to make me understand her characters, she never quite succeeded.  I never could identify with any of them or the forces that drove them.  And while the details of their pasts were described in detail, I just couldn't believe them.  Because of this, while I do acknowledge the author's craftsmanship, I can only give this book a mild recommendation.	2002-10-05

Ms. O'Connor has a flare for dialog as well as a primal understanding of the darkness in people's souls.  All her characters have a relationship with God and she combines Christian imagery, an apocalyptic vision of life and a strong element of cruelty.  And yet, there is a deeply human element that gives me the shivers because it exposes truths I'd rather not see.<br />I could tell from the very beginning of each story that something ominous was going to happen.  I didn't know when, I didn't know how, and I didn't know exactly what it would be. Always, I was surprised. And yet, when I thought of it later, each story could have gone no other way.  All of them had a sad or tragic ending, although some were more awful than others.  What keeps the narrative exciting though is a way she has of suddenly disappearing the storyline and taking it up in another place, leaving just enough information to spark the imagination.  Then, when I think I have it all figured out, things change again.<br />Ms. O'Connor writes in simple startling sentences.  And most of the stories are no more than 20 or 30 pages long.  I found it hard to read one story right after the other however.  Each one was so thought provoking that, even though I felt a great deal of discomfort, I wanted to stay with each just a little bit longer.  That's because they move much too fast and are too intriguing to stop.  Later, when the initial shock of the story is over, is the time to work it out philosophically.  And it is then that I could appreciate the mastery of her craft.<br />This is a truly fine book and I unquestionably give it a high recommendation.  It is certainly not for everyone however.  These stories haunt uncomfortably.  But those willing to explore the dark side of human nature in this small work of art will love it.	2002-09-28

He describes life aboard ship, the geography of the island and the technical aspects of making clothing, tattooing and  preparing food as well as many native ritual customs.  This is all seen through the eyes of his lead character, Tom, called Tommo by the natives.  The book put me right there with him, when, exhausted and starved, he and Toby, the other seaman he jumped ship with, find their way into the world of the Typees.  The two sailors are treated well, but are kept virtual prisoners and there is apprehension throughout about the Typees' cannibal tendencies.  In spite of that, there is also joy as Tommo views the simple and carefree life of the people he considers savages and contrasts it to life in the so-called &quot;civilized world&quot;.<br />The Typees seem perennially happy and content.  They spend a lot of time amusing themselves as food is plentiful and there is not much work to do.  Their lives are idealized so much that I found myself raising a quizzical eyebrow at times.  But the story was so good and so well written that I didn't let it get in my way of enjoying the book, which must have been received with similar delight when it was published as it not only painted a picture of a better world, it appealed to everyone's sense of adventure.<br />I loved the book, especially the social commentary.  I found myself reading it quickly and at odd times during to day just to see what would happen on the next page.  It sure was a good story and seems as fresh and meaningful today it when was published more than a century and a half ago.	2002-09-21

Mr. Iyer spent a year in Kyoto to learn about Zen as well as Japan. Along the way he met a very special woman, Sachiko, and learned more about the essence of being Japanese than he ever expected.  I was particularly interested in this book because I have a wonderful Japanese daughter-in-law and have been to Japan myself.  I remember the few days we spent in Kyoto with fond recollections and smiled at the author's vivid descriptions.  I also found myself nodding in agreement at some of the discoveries he made about Sachiko and her way of thinking as I, too, have had my eyes opened in similar ways.<br />Mr. Iyer has the ability to paint a complex portrait in words.  I found myself sharing his discoveries, from his experiences in the temples to the very modern music clubs.  The center of the book, however, is Sachiko.  She's 30 years old, the mother of two children and married to a Japanese businessman who spends 18 or more hours a day at work.  She speaks English with difficulty but has read a lot of classic literature and is also an aficionado of a wide variety of pop music icons.  In spite of her traditional upbringing, she yearns for a larger life, beyond the confines of her home.<br />Mr. Iyer becomes her friend and they do a lot of sightseeing together.  She's free all day and so is he, which makes their friendship easy.  Some of the most interesting scenes are when he tries to speak Japanese and she tries to speak English and misunderstandings follow, both because of the language itself and also because of different ways of thinking.<br />I'm a romantic and fully expected their relationship to blossom into an intimate one, but Mr. Iyer is so evasive that even though they do become very close, he avoids those kinds of topics.  Instead, he focuses on what he perceives to be her feelings and his growing understanding of her.  It seems a little strange to me that only in the later part of the book did he drop a gentle hint that their relationship was a bit more than that of just friends.  But even then, I never was sure.<br />This is a great travelogue.  I not only learned a lot but also recognized things I have come to understand about the Japanese character.  There are long sections about literature, both Japanese and Western, which I found to be boring.  And the relationship between Iyer and Sachiko left me annoyed.  But for a unique picture of Kyoto and a deeper understanding of the cross-cultural differences between Japanese and Westerners, I do give it a definite recommendation.r.

He thought he'd be building hospitals and planting trees, but instead he became a minesweeper.  The two years he spent there were filled with the horrors of war, but he kept a journal and took photographs.  The result is this searing photographic essay, depicting his day-to-day life, and commenting on the individuals in the photos, the senselessness of war, and his own depression when his two-year tour of duty was over.<br />&quot;The only thing we wanted was to go home,&quot; he says, giving a name and a personality to each young man in the photos.  Some were killed within minutes after the photos were taken; some lived longer and were wounded or killed later; and some, like Vlad himself, lived to tell about it.  His words are simple but carry universal truths.  &quot;Our fate did not always depend on us,&quot; he says, as he describes the act of sweeping for mines so that others troops would be able to follow in relative safety.  &quot;Everything about it was insane,&quot; he says, as he later looks at the politics, which thrust him into the war as well as surprising bits of kindness from the Afghans who mostly looked at the solidiers with sadness and suspicion in his eyes.  Once, an Afghan woman had baked bread especially for them and when, as he says, &quot;I held that fresh fragrant bread in my hand, I almost forgot there was a war.&quot;<br />Some parts of the narrative are repetitive which added emphasis to what he was saying.  And some parts are pieces of dreams and nightmares that haunted him later.  Always though, there was a simple truth to it all.  It brought me right into the heart of the madness and I could feel his fear as well as his desire to survive.  The combination of photographs and words went straight to my heart.<br /><br />This is a fine book. Anyone who is willing to explore the harsh reality of soldiers everywhere, and this Soviet soldier's experience in particular, will find it wonderful.

It's set in Alaska in 1915, where winters are long and cold, mosquitoes are plentiful, and there are very few women.  And so when Bigelow Greene, age 26, is sent there by the government to set up a weather station in Anchorage, he is lonely and disoriented.  There's startling beauty here and a sense of isolation.  Bigelow yearns for a woman and soon begins a relationship with a native woman he knows only as \\"The Aleut\\".  He's completely obsessed with her, and adores her strength, her unpretentious sensuality and complete self-possession.  The writing itself is sensual too; from the descriptions of how the woman butchers animals, to the erotic details of their coupling.  The fact that she never speaks only adds to his passion for her. When she moves away, he is devastated.<br />Much of the book details this period of his isolation, in which he plunges himself into his work, building a unique kite which holds instruments and carefully measures the weather conditions. His need for a woman is overwhelming though and the reader feels his pain and isolation as he attempts to satisfy his raging feelings.  Eventually, he connects with another women, who is also mute. Her other characteristics disgust him however.  How this all plays out is fascinating and forced me to continue reading this spare 256-page book all the way through in a very short time.<br />The reader gets to know Bigelow intimately.  I felt I was right there with him as he struggled to understand the weather, the landscape and his own emotional needs.  There's a constant feeling of isolation and a metaphorical statement about the human condition.  It's fascinating.  And even though I've come to expect different and innovative settings for Ms. Harrison's novels, this one is unique in focusing entirely on one character's point of view.  The result is an unsettling portrait of loneliness and alienation.  Naturally I expected an unhappy conclusion.  I was wrong.  It was a pleasure to be smiling wistfully as I turned the last page.tion.  Naturally I expected an unhappy conclusion.  I was wrong.

This 1940 novel by Carson McCullers is set in a small southern town.  It's about five different people and their relationships to each other.  There is surface structure inasmuch as the chapters move back and forth, focusing on one character and then another and moving the action forward.  But there's an appealing off-center feeling to it all, as this study in what it means to be a human being reflects the human condition without having to tie it all up in a neat little package.<br />Driving the story is John Singer, a deaf mute.  When his friend Sprios, a fellow deaf mute, goes insane, John Singer attracts other alienated people, who pour their hearts out to him, believing that he understands everything.  There's Jake, who drinks hard, requires constant stimulation of his senses to feel alive, and views the world though a communist philosophy.  There's Dr. Copeland, a black physician, who so wants to improve the condition of his race, that he has driven his wife and children away because they never fit the picture of the way he wanted them to be.  There's Mick, the adolescent girl, introspective and intuitive, who dreams of a future filled with music and travel.  And then there is Biff, the owner of the Caf&eacute;, who collects old newspapers and tries to make sense out of what is going on around him.  Everyone feels that the deaf-mute has some sort of magical presence.  But yet, he too, proves to be very human.<br />The town itself is important to the story, and Ms. McCullers' makes use of the rhythms of the seasons and of music to bring the reader right there.  The coming-of-age of the adolescent made me sad and the realities of racism caused me to cringe in horror. The alienation is deeply frustrating.  This is exemplified by one very moving scene where two men debate how to handle injustices.  Both men want the same things, but yet they talk past each other, each demanding that the other must follow a certain prescribed ideology.<br />Each character is restricted by limitations. Each one has desires.  And each one has his or her desires crushed.  How each one reacts and how this interaction affects everyone else is the essence of the story.  The author's skill pulls it all together masterfully.  It's a disturbing book as it tugs at that chord of isolation that exists in all of us.  And yet, it is a wonderful read.

With the gift of words that seem to come straight from the 1890s, Paula Cohen has fashioned a unique love story. When Mario Alfieri, a world-renowned Italian tenor comes to New York to continue his successes at the Metropolitan opera, he falls in love with 19-year old Clara Adler, the sickly and penniless ward of a recently deceased millionaire.  There's a mystery about the details of Clara's past, and an evil lawyer, Thaddeus Chadwick, who has his own reasons to do Clara harm.  Mario and Clara wed, but as the layers of secrecy gradually unfold, the reader cannot help but be drawn into this tale of love, revenge and murder.<br />The story rings true on every level, even the most minor characters sketched so deeply that they not only live and breath, they live and breath in the 19th century -- these are not just modern characters in period garb. However, some scenes that drive the plot stretch the boundaries of the delicate nature of literature of that time, and will titillate even the most modern reader.  As the characters develop, so does the story and there are enough twists and turns of the plot to keep the reader alert and intrigued until the very last page.<br />In the book's acknowledgments, the author gives thanks to her writing group, which she describes as still going strong and still an inspiration.  I am proud to be part of that group and have listened to Paula's voice reading parts of the manuscript aloud for several years.  I shared her joy when St. Martin's Press bought it and continue to be delighted to hear of the recent publication of British and Italian editions.  And, even though I'm familiar with the book, I just read it through from cover to cover and was totally impressed by her command of language, the humanity of the characters and the pacing of the story.  It alls fit together in a tapestry of words and was a deeply satisfying reading experience.  Highly recommended.	2002-08-17

The Mexican people, formerly ruled by Spain, had been Catholic for centuries and welcomed the Bishop, Jean Marie Latour, and his Vicar, Father Joseph.  As the two men travel through the countryside, it is clear that the landscape itself is a major character in this novel.  Ms. Cather's descriptions brought me right there and I could almost breath the perfume of the earth as well as feel the impact of the mountains of rock and open desert.<br />In what reads like a series of short stories, the priests travel throughout the area and meet a wide variety of people along the way.  Always, their adventures take on mythical and religious significance, such as when Father Latour finds himself quite lost and then sees a juniper tree in the shape of a cross that leads him to food and shelter.  Each of these stories has a crisis and each crisis is answered by a religious experience.  This deepens the faith of the two priests who share their common religious feelings even though they have very different personalities.<br />Ms. Cather had the uncanny ability to capture exactly what each character felt and let the reader experience it moment to moment.  Her detailed descriptions are many faceted. For example she uses the character of Kit Carson to show both gentleness and compassion as well as vile cruelty to the Indians.  Always, she just lays out the story and lets the reader make his or her own judgments.<br />One of the problems I had with the book was my own desire to have the priests confront some difficult choice.  That didn't happen.  Their faith was always there.  And, if there were any demons for them to conquer, it might have been a very subtle pride in what they were doing.  In my mind, it made them just a little too perfect to identify with.  This, however, was obviously not the author's intention which was to tell the tale as she saw it, filled with simple miracles and a loving testament to these two men whose impact can still be felt centuries later.  It was a good book.  I recommend it.was to tell the tale as she saw it, filled with simple miracles and a loving testament to these two men whose impact can still be felt centuries later.

The shopgirl is 28-year old Mirabelle, who sells gloves at Neiman Marcus.  She's looking for love but can't make a meaningful connection in vacuous Los Angeles.  Her relationships just don't click until she meets Roy Porter, a millionaire in his 50s. He's looking for love too, but just not with Mirabelle.  The writer has an excellent understanding of human nature and has the ability to clearly explain that what the characters say is usually not what they mean. I felt I knew them all, including Mirabelle's co-worker, Lisa, who uses her feminine charms as a weapon.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down. It's well written and the plot moved quickly, drawing me into the author's world.  I found myself identifying with Mirabelle and was pleased with the satisfying ending.	2002-07-27

Even though it's written in the third person, it's told through the narrative voice of George Willard, the town reporter, who shows up in most of the stories, sometimes taking an active role and at other times just telling a story.<br />It is obvious that the writer loves these people, and is frustrated at the isolation and unhappiness of their lives, even though he makes it clear that they hold within themselves everything needed to make them happy.  The character in the first story is a dying old writer who is attempting to write about all the people he has known as a \\"book of grotesques\\".  What follows is the collection of stories, which each character fulfilling that expectation.<br />There are the young lovers who don't quite connect; there is a old man so obsessed with religious fervor that he attempts to sacrifice his grandson; there is a married man who regrets it all and tries to warn a younger man of future unhappiness; there's a doctor and a sick woman who try to connect. The book is full of people who toil all their lives and never achieve happiness. As I made my way through the book I kept hoping that even one of the characters would rise above the morass.  It didn't happen.<br />The writer has a wonderful sense of place and the town of Winesburg in the early part of the 20th Century is very real.  These people were not poor or disadvantaged in the usual sense of the word; they didn't suffer fire, floods or famine.  Instead, they trapped themselves in their own psychological webs that made it impossible for them to lead anything but sad unfulfilled lives.  This is a fine book and stands alone as a clear voice of its time.	2002-07-22

It is a story of a young black woman, who, at 26, decides to go to Paris to become a writer.  She's enamored with the stories of other successful black writers who have done this, such as James Baldwin and Langston Hughes, and wants to follow in their footsteps.  It's 1986, and there are random bombings in Paris because of the Algeria situation but this never comes across either as a reality or as a metaphor.  What does come across is her loneliness as she encounters one misadventure after another.  She's penniless, but gets jobs as an au pair, an artist's model and a caregiver of an elderly lady.  Along the way she meets some interesting people and even has a love affair or two.  She is always aware of prejudice and the realities of living on her own.<br />I found the book a pleasant read but there is not much focus to it.  The plot follows her adventures or misadventures and the characters come and go.  It rambled too much for my taste and, and even though I learned a bit about her experience as an expatriate, I found the story too one-dimensional and soon got bored.	2002-07-12

Subtitled \\"Wounded Spirits in a Promised Land\\", the author won a Pulitzer Prize for this book in 1987.  He's a journalist for The New York Times and was assigned to Jerusalem from 1979-1984.  The book has been updated in May of 2002 and now includes references to 9/11 as well as other more recent events in the Middle East.  Now, more than ever, this book is relevant for an understanding of what is going on today.  Mr. Shipler, who makes a point of saying that he is neither Jewish nor Arab, has an impartial American's point of view.  The book is dense with facts and I found his explanations of the history of the region clear and balanced.<br />The major part of the book, however, is devoted to a great many interviews of both Arabs and Jews.  And, through their eyes, the reader is thrust into the human element of the conflict.  Often, it is repetitive as over and over again he makes his point of contrasting the viewpoints from the different sides.  But that only added to the intensity of the experience of reading this book, which was assigned as required reading for a course I am taking at NYU about the Middle East.  I've taken other courses that dealt with the facts, but this book goes well beyond the facts. It goes into the hearts and minds of the people.<br />In contrasting chapters he brings out the viewpoints of the opposing groups.  The Arabs view the Israelis as violent, craven, and alien with a superior attitude.  The Israelis view the Arabs as violent, craven, primitive and exotic.  Both have fears and fantasies regarding seduction and intermarriage, and even though sometimes there is a mingling of cultures, fear and distrust usually prevails.  The first edition of the book seems to end with a bit of hope as there are visits back and forth between Arab and Jewish schools, and some group activities inspired by the human potential movement.  Some young people were even sent to camp together in Maine, and friendships were forged.  However, by 2002, all this had turned to ashes as the last few years have again divided people and left each group with hatred for the other.  Now I understand the reasons why.<br />Reading this book was uncomfortable at times, but I'm well aware that it is more than merely uncomfortable for the people involved.  Mr. Shipler has given me the opportunity to appreciate an experience that has always seemed strange and distant to me.  It is not light reading.  It's 531 pages of well-written prose that manages to unravel the threads of complexity and make it all seem real.

It must have been courageous for her do so at the time as it's all stream of consciousness and she lets the reader get a glimpse inside her thought processes.  The very slight plot focuses on a vacationing British family and their guests and there's a constant interior monologue about every little thing.<br />The first part, entitled &quot;The Window&quot; is by far the largest section of the book and the reader has to plow though a complex web of the author's thoughts as she focuses on one detail after another using all her senses.  True, she's a gifted writer and deeply explores the relationships between men and women, focusing mainly on Mrs. Ramsay, the matriarch of the family.  It's as if everything is in the background and the only thing in the foreground is what she has in her head.<br />The second part, entitled &quot;Time Passes&quot; is perhaps the strongest part of the book.  It focuses on an empty house and its details of decay over a ten year period.  It is masterfully done.<br />The third part, entitled &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; is about the remaining members of the family, who come back to the house in order to take a trip to the lighthouse which has been postponed for ten years.  It's all very symbolic and the reader is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the meaning of it all.<br />This is the only Virginia Woolf book I've ever read and although I can appreciate the skill of the author, I'm not interested in reading any more of her works and can recommend this book only for fans of hers as well as those with a curiosity about her writing.	2002-06-22

There's a great premise for this novel by Paul Theroux.  The narrator is an unnamed middle-aged writer who takes a job as a manager of a small seedy hotel in Honolulu.  What follows is a book full of overlapping stories about the constant parade of guests and locals and a fresh look at what Hawaii is like by the New England-born author who now makes Hawaii his part-time home.<br />There's a wide variety of characters and a loose non-conventional plot.  Most memorable of all is the larger-than-life figure of millionaire and hotel owner Buddy Hamstra, a big man who over-indulges his appetites in life.  There's the writer's wife and daughter as well as permanent and temporary hotel guests and employees.  It's a collection of vignettes interwoven with reoccurring themes and finely developed people.  It's big and sprawling and full of pathos and humor, small portraits of human nature focusing on the themes of love and death.<br />I found myself drawn into it, enjoying the author's sharp observations and finding myself wanting to laugh out loud.  How each character views this world is fascinating and the writer dares to ridicule it all. There's a power in the book that kept me reading in spite of the meandering pace. It's sad and funny and very human all at the same time as it willingly explores such topics such as ethnic tensions and physical disabilities.  It might not always be a flattering picture of a place we sometimes think of as paradise, but it sure does seem real, as the characters grope and blunder along in their lives below a constantly shining Hawaiian sun.  I just loved the experience of reading this book.  Definitely recommended.	2002-06-11

Her detailed descriptions of objects are intrinsic to the stories, tiny sparkles that spread out and create a canvas on which her characters interact.  Every story has its own suppressed passion as Ms. Mansfield gets right into the heart of what makes us all human.  They are filled with arrivals and departures, spinsterhood and marriage, love and loss and pangs of despair.  Children play a role in her writings, as do distinctions of social class.  Life is a struggle for her characters who are timeless in their humanity, although they all live in a world that existed more than 80 years ago.  With rare exceptions, the stories are sad.  I was impressed by her writing, which is layered with subtleties in the way she deals with the major themes of life and death.  Her structure is unique for its time, as there doesn't seem to be any center or an easily identified beginning, middle and end.  Often, they are simply small slices of life, rare glimpses into human nature with sharp insights that sparked my own memories and feelings.  It might have been uncomfortable, but reading these stories was a deeply enriching literary experience.	2002-06-08

The author is master of the nuanced barb and he uses them with seeming delight and controlled rage. It is an unpleasant book to read and I know I would hate the author if I met him in person, and yet I can appreciate his skill in creating the discomforting atmosphere, his fascination with things that go wrong, and the dark side of human nature.<br />Tony Last, an aristocrat who devotes himself to the upkeep of his expensive ancestral home is blind to the infidelities of his wife Brenda, who parties in London with her sycophantic lover. There's a whole cast of vapid characters, each exquisitely developed with revealing detail. When tragedy strikes it's like a piece of chalk scraped upon a blackboard, and as the story continues to unfold, and Tony travels to the jungles of Brazil, the plot swerves into a painful absurdity. It's all one big farce and yet there is no comic relief. And by the end of the book, only sadness prevails.<br />I must give this book a high ranking however because of Mr. Waugh's skill and his uncanny ability to uncover some painful human truths that I'd rather not see. I can therefore only recommend it to students of human nature who are willing to be tormented in the same way the author torments his characters. Just be forewarned.	2002-06-01

It's set in the early fifties when Vietnam was still Indo-China and there was a war raging between the French and the Vietnamese.  It's obvious he's worried about the future and American involvement, and this theme resonates throughout the book as well as gives an eerie foreshadowing of what we all know happened later.  At only 188 pages, it's a seemingly simple story of mystery, adventure and love. But it's also a story of a people, a place and a time as well as a warning about the future.<br />Thomas Fowler, the narrator, is a hardened British war correspondent.  He in a relationship young Vietnamese woman named Phuong, enjoys his opium pipes, and manages to get along with his fellow correspondents.  Suddenly, a young naïve American, named Alden Pyle, arrives in Vietnam, supposedly as an aid worker. When he declares his love for Phuong, the plot thickens. But this is just one facet of the story as both men are thrust into the war, viewing the meaningless deaths around them and coming very close to death themselves.  Pyle's mission to Indo-China becomes increasingly suspect, and as Fowler discovers one clue after another, the conclusion is inevitable.<br />I was immediately drawn into the story, which sets up a mystery and keeps the reader wondering until the very end.  At the same time, the three main characters are deeply developed, not only as to their individualisms, but also as to their national character.  The British correspondent takes a caustic view of the world; the American is effusive and idealistic, and the Vietnamese woman is stoic.  They move around in a Vietnam where the French are fast losing their hold, and everyone knows that change is going to happen.<br />I loved this book. Every word reverberated with a truth that existed when it was written, and which proved to be a prophesy of things to come.  It also enriched my understanding of the dark period in history that followed.  Highly recommended.	2002-05-25

However, even though this short novella is only 157 pages long, it certainly can stand on its own.  The setting is post-war Vienna, a once-beautiful city that was now nothing but war rubble.  It's administered by the four victorious nations, Russia, France, Great Britain and the United States, and they all communicate with each other in the language of their former enemy.  There's a somber mood, a feeling of decay and destruction throughout.  And, of course there's a mystery, and lots of suspense, as the reader is swept into a story of intrigue, betrayal and constantly changing alliances.<br />The form is interesting too as it's narrated by a British policeman.  He has some interesting philosophical discussions with the lead character, a fellow Brit named Rollo Martins who has been summoned to Vienna by a long-time friend, Harry Limes, only to find a funeral in progress for Limes when he arrives.  The mystery deepens as he sets upon doing his own form of detective work. The writing is stark, with excellent dialog and the cast of characters is somewhat confusing at first.  As we learn more and more, the book picks up speed and we're hurtled into the conclusion that, while it is satisfactory, never really answers all of the questions raised.  With just a few words though, it made me look at some deeper issues than the plot, such as the moral conscience of the characters as well as the particular time period in which they lived.  And if there are no easy answers? Well, that's the way life is.	2002-05-22

There's Pixie, a former Miss New Jersey who is now a dentist's wife.  And there's Ezra, her 16-year-old web-toed son from her first marriage.  Both have a keen eye for sharp observation, and view their world through a darkly comedic prism that cuts to the quick.  I found myself chuckling as well as cringing as the images the author creates come fast and hard, creating a roller coaster of emotions in a seemingly simple but emotionally complex story that leaves little breathing space.<br />This is a coming-of-age story for both mother and son.  She has to confront the demons of her past; he has to come to terms with his gay father and the act of violence that his mother perpetrates against her new husband.  Her memories haunt her; his are the basis for his new awakenings.  As the book goes on, we learn more and more about the family and Pixie's mother, whose eccentricities are forgiven when her own past secret act of courage is unearthed.  All this is set in the wasteland of suburbia, and every detail of description is unique, offbeat and fresh.<br />I totally enjoyed this book and the probing insights that go way beneath the surface.  Ms. Baggott has a gift of using humor and pathos with brutal honesty.  It makes for good reading.	2002-05-18

I expected this story to be about this and to also learn more about the Italian campaign.  I was unprepared, however, to find myself in the middle of a tale constructed with magic realism, introducing some very memorable characters, the background for the story being just that - a background.<br />Because of the stupidity of their commanders, four of these soldiers find themselves far behind enemy lines. One of the men is a simple-minded giant who has rescued a small Italian boy from the rubble; one of the men is graduate of Howard University; one is a small-time preacher and outspoken hustler; and one is a Puerto Rican who can speak Italian because he has grown up in an Italian neighborhood.  Eventually they find their way to a town that has known its share of sadness.  Throughout the book, there are unexplained miracles, such as rabbits that mysteriously multiply under the floorboards of an elderly Italian's bedroom.  And there are also some silly editorial mistakes, such as a man of 67 thinking back to his relationship with a lost love 40 years before when he was 17. It made me wonder if the author did this on purpose or whether he just couldn't do the arithmetic.<br />However, the strength of the story did make up for my doubts, and I was swept along with it, especially as it neared the end.  Even though it's about war, there are good and bad people on all sides.  And, actually, it is a German soldier who performs a vital act of heroism and compassion.  A mystical quality pervades everything and the writing is strong and evocative.  It put me right there in that village of Tuscany and yet there was something about it that made me know that these people and the village could never really have existed the way they were described. This was such a contrast to the author's former best selling memoir, &quot;The Color of Water&quot; that I had to readjust my thinking and let myself be placed into this magical world he took such a risk to create.  I applaud him for his efforts.This was such a contrast to the author's former best selling memoir, &quot;The Color of Water&quot; that I had to readjust my thinking and let myself be placed into this magical world he took such a risk to create.

This mystery novel is about a serial killer whose victims are all young women who are somehow connected to an NBA basketball team.  Called in to help solve the crime is Dr. Lori Patrick whose specialty is profiling the criminal mind.  However, because of a tragic incident in his own past, Mike Mitchell, the detective she is assigned to work with, is hostile towards her and her profession.  She also has her own demons to fight as together they try to solve the mystery.<br />Amy L Talford, the author, was once married to a professional basketball player and she has certainly captured the atmosphere well.  This is her first novel and she shows solid craftsmanship in the development of the fast-paced plot and memorable characterizations.  I'm not a big mystery fan but this story is intriguing and I got swept right up in it.  At only 202 pages, it's a quick and powerful read.  I also thought I knew who the murderer was.  I was wrong.  She sure had me fooled. And that's a sign of a good mystery.  Recommended.	2002-05-12

For its literary style and emotion impact, it's being compared to \\"Cold Mountain\\", a tremendously successful novel that also brought the realities of the Civil War to life through the experiences of a single character.<br />There's an authenticity about the setting which is augmented by each chapter heading which includes long excepts from actual period documents.  This framework works well, as do all the little details of the period, which seemed to just pick me up and set me down right in the middle of the Ozark region in the 1860s.  And some of her descriptive passages seemed like pure poetry.  Instead of focusing on the big battles, it is about bloodshed and fear and tumultuous conditions for the average person during those awful times.  The heroine, Adair Colley, is just 18 years old when the war starts. When Union troops burn her house and imprison her father, she takes to the road with her two younger sisters, only to be captured and sent to a federal women's prison in St. Louis.  The conditions there are harsh and she suffers from fever, but refuses to make a confession that might put her brother and neighbors in danger.  Somehow, though, she has a romance with the Union officer who interrogates her, helps her escape, and vows to return to her after the war.<br />This is where the credibility of the book broke down for me.  She's just a little too pretty, has a little too much grit, and there is little, if any complexity to her character.  Of course we root for the poor dear as she conquers obstacle after obstacle, always surviving in spite of horrible odds even though she is has consumption, her food supply is sparse, and she's constantly running from Union troops. The bad guys are just a little too bad, the good guys get killed or suffer, and, even though she has to steal to get by, she always comes out on top.  I never did see what she saw in the Union officer she loves and even though there are several chapters devoted to his battle experience, he never really come across in any depth.  The conclusion was inevitable and I knew it long before I finished the book, which soon became very boring to read.  I also can't understand why the author decided not to use quotation marks and this often broke my concentration just to follow some of the dialogue.<br />I therefore have to give this book a mixed review. It gets a high recommendation for its setting and sense of history.  But as for the characters and the situation, I have to give it a \\"thumbs down\\".t by, she always comes out on top.

The British writer Henry Green's literary skill went far beyond a comedy of manners, which this book appears to be on the surface. Dense with meaning, &quot;Nothing&quot; is a short literary gem, which forces the reader to read a million nuances into the witty and yet deeply dense conversations which make up the entirety of the book.  The story is set in 1948 and follows John and Jane, now middle aged but still reminiscing about an affair they had many years before when they were still married. They both have new relationships, Liz and Richard, but still see each other frequently for meals or for tea.  Their respective children, Mary and Philip, are now grown and want to marry.  But of course there are complications.<br />The world that the author creates for the reader is a very British one.  The dialogue is precise but filled with hidden meanings, as what is unsaid is often even more important than what is said.  There's a wonderful symmetrical balance in each of the conversations as well as in the structure of the book.  The characters speak for themselves, with very little description, and, through their words alone, the twists and turns of the story emerge, the sounds of their voices echoing on the pages.  The question of what really happened and is happening is always just beyond our reach, and the even though the characters might be moved around like chess pieces at the author's whim, they never do change or gain insight into their behavior.  Surprisingly, this is still an amazingly satisfying read, as if is the reader himself or herself who gets to experience their world and gain insight into the inevitability of the conclusion.  This book is a delightful read and a real treat.  I highly recommend it.	2002-04-20

I know little of Italian politics or history, but that didn't keep me from being swept up in the story, whose well-drawn characters inhabited a feudal landscape that was inevitably fading away.  Don Fabrizio, a prince in Sicily, is at the peak of his power in 1860, living a life of luxury with his wife and seven children and taking the appeasement of his sensual appetites with other women as a given, despite his wife's tears.  But around him swirl the winds of war and change, as Garibaldi's army is sweeping through Sicily and there are changes that challenge his way of life. He resents the upstart commoner who is making a fortune by buying the land and yet still is willing to arrange a match between his nephew and the commoner's beautiful daughter, Angelica. There is a great scene where this marriage arrangement takes place, which is ripe with the subtleties of class.<br />The writing is rich in descriptive texture.  I could almost smell the fragrance of the garden and touch the extravagant furnishings of the estates. This sets the stage for the very real people who taste the dust of long carriage rides as well as dress in silk and attend great balls. I learned about the politics of the time, the role of the church and the view of the world as perceived by the privileged few for the fifty-year time span of the book, which concludes in 1910.  It was a deeply satisfying read.  Highly recommended.	2002-04-13

It's based on her father's experiences in the Philippines during World War 2 and it describes the devastating effect it had on the people.  The title comes from the saying \\"when the elephants dance, the chickens must be careful\\", and it alludes to the Japanese and Americans as the powerful elephants and the Filipino people as the chickens who must scurry about and try not to get trampled.<br />The storyline follows some Filipino neighbors who hide in a basement during the final days of the war, venturing out only to find food.  These trips are dangerous and capture means torture or death, but still they venture out.  There's a 12-year-old boy, his 17-year-old sister as well as a young man who has chosen to be a guerilla.  We get to know each of them well, as well as their families and identify with their fear, hunger and courage.  But Ms. Holthe has added a second element to the story. While they are trapped in that basement, and later when they are prisoners in Manila, the elders tell stories laced with magic realism, which not only keeps their minds off the war around them, but also introduces the reader to some of the history, myths and legends of the people.  This structure added depth and texture as the life lessons they taught affected the hard choices made by the characters.<br />I loved the voice, the tone, the interweaving of past and present.  And I loved learning about the Philippine culture.  I could almost taste the food, smell the ripe foliage, feel the heat.  I learned about the hard years of Spanish rule, the role of the church, and the poverty of the lower classes.  There are lessons in everyday living.  And some moving love stories.  This book has everything.  The author, however, has been criticized for getting distances between places confused and for misspelling Tagalog words.  As an American, however, I was not aware of these small details. I was totally caught up in the story and found myself thinking about the characters long after I put the book down for the day.

It's an authentic voice that rings with the cadence of the city and the job he worked day after day, dealing with the dregs of society and everyday crime, as well as some of the major social issues of the time.<br />We first meet Jimmy as a nine-year old boy, listening to Dragnet with his police officer father in their Staten Island home.  We follow him through the police academy and then out to the streets.  We meet his fellow cops and feel the pressures of the job, watching some of them turn into alcoholics or commit suicide.  We see how many of the rules are bent to accommodate the reality of what is going on in the street. We're right alongside Jimmy, feeling his anger and despair when he goes to funeral services for fellow cops brutally gunned down.  We meet celebrities and junkies and Hell's Angels and other assorted oddball characters.  We're surprised at some stories, and we cringe at others and wonder how one man could have experienced so many outrageous things. Then we realize that these are the highlights of a long career, all compressed into a fast paced, action packed narrative with something new on every page.  It's a good story, well told.

Subtitled, \\"A Story of Wall Street\\", it is a seemingly simple story about a lawyer who hires a gentleman named Bartleby as a scrivener in his office.  This was way back in the days before photocopy machines and scriveners performed the necessary tasks of tediously hand copying documents over and over.  Bartleby was good at the copying part of his job, but when asked to proofread aloud one day he simply replied, \\"I prefer not to.\\"  From that moment forward, he used the phrase \\"I prefer not to\\" for every task requested of him, eventually \\"preferring not to\\" do any work whatsoever. The lawyer, who is astounded by Bartleby's attitude, tells the story in the first person.<br />The story is rich in language and yet spare in actual action.  The reader is forced to think, and think seriously about the choices we make daily.  Bartleby chose to rebel and become an anti-hero.  But the real protagonist of the story is the lawyer, who is drawn into Bartleby's power and grows to admire him.  The conclusion is sad, but inevitable. Recommended.	2002-03-23
1612584:US	52294653	R1D4ZVJRXAIBC5	0679767878	187559849	The Man Without Qualities Vol. 1: A Sort of Introduction and Pseudo Reality Prevails	Books	4	22	41	N	N	An intellectual epic work,  but much too long and boring	Considered by some to be one of the greatest modernists of the 20th century, Austrian writer Robert Musil spent most of his lifetime (1880-1942) writing this epic work. Volume 1 is 725 pages long and a challenge to read.  It's set in Austria in 1913 and centers on a central character, Ulrich, a young man who views the crumbling empire with excruciating detail and long philosophical discourses. He's the voice of the author, of course, and the title suggests that it is his voice alone that hasn't been corrupted by the world around him.<br />With the exception of Ulrich, who I found to be a pompous know-it-all, I loved the many other characters that populate this tome.  There's a female cousin who opens her home as a meeting place for the aristocracy to discuss politics, her young Jewish maid who is wooed by the black servant of an wealthy German industrialist, a couple whose marriage is in trouble, several mistresses and a laborer who is convicted of murder.  The author has the ability to get under the skin of these people, describe them both physically and psychologically and make them real.  They exist and interact and the reader gets to know them but, alas, there never is any resolution and the reader is left hanging.<br />Clearly, the author exhibits a high intellect and understanding of human nature.  I could open the book at any point and find a philosophical nugget ripe with meaning.  And I was constantly amazed at how so many of the concepts introduced could be applied today.  Specifically, I could relate to his view of technology, even though the technology in 1913 was only a beginning glimmer of what we take for granted today.  However, it took him thousands of words to say what could have been summed up in a few sentences.  There were huge sections that went on for pages and pages as two of the characters debated some obscurity.  I'd rather learn about human nature by the characters' actions rather than long discourses and so I was impatient and bored.  As I was reading this book for a book discussion group, I pushed myself to finish it, hoping to feel the familiar satisfaction that I can get from a good book.  It didn't happen.  I have no intention of reading the next two volumes.  It might be interesting to see the nuances of philosophy for a few minutes, but life is too short to want to read more than a few pages of this. I recommend this book for students of philosophy and modernism only.  All others stay away.I was reading this book for a book discussion group, I pushed myself to finish it, hoping to feel the familiar satisfaction that I can get from a good book.  It didn't happen.

And, as I live in New York City, ranching is something I know absolutely nothing about.  That's why this book by David McCumber, in which he chronicles a year spent as a ranch hand, intrigued me.  As he was a 44-year old journalist with no experience ranching, I could easily relate to his trials as tribulations as he learned what it takes to be a cowboy today.  He's a straightforward clear writer and he uses his words well to describe even the most mundane tasks that are the daily routines for the people who live and work on ranches.<br />Basically, it's all about the care and feeding of cows and this includes the baling of hay, an essential job which has its own set of challenges.  There's the birthing of the calves and the cleaning of the pens.  There's setting up and irrigation system, and fixing miles of fencing.  Often the weather is brutal and virtually all the work is outside.  There's some horseback riding, of course, but nowadays most of the work is done with various trucks and motorcycles and vans which always need mechanical work, also done by the ranch hands.  Mistakes are made often and result in a tongue lashing from the owner who knows everything there is to know about ranching and wants no other way of life.<br />These are real people that the author meets and he writes about them all with a sense of admiration and I'm glad he also included the history of the White Sulphur Springs area, which he researched as background.  The magnificent scenery comes alive, as do his aching muscles.  He enjoys it all completely and made it quite real for me.  I must admit though, that in spite of his detailed explanations, I didn't understand it all, especially when he described the mechanical aspects of the baling machines or the irrigation system or the fixing of the motor in a truck.  However, I had no trouble at all understanding the birthing, branding and castrating process.  And I was right there with him as he fixed fences and chased straggling cattle for miles.<br />I thank Mr. McCumber for writing this book.  I learned a lot from it.  Now, whenever I hear the word \\"cowboy\\", I'll think about the real work that that is his daily grind.  I'll think of the harsh and beautiful country.  And the simple joy of a job well done.

I never read Mark Twain books and I sure missed out, because he is surely one of the finest American writers that ever lived.  In Huckleberry Finn, he brought me right into the heart of his 19th century Missouri childhood and made me feel what life must have been like then.  Huckleberry Finn is a wonderful character, and the book is full of elements of high drama as the boy escapes from his wicked father and goes on to a series of adventures with the runaway slave, Jim.  Along the way, he meets an assortment of memorable characters, including a murderous feuding family and a couple of con men.  He even gets to meet up again with his old friend, Tom Sawyer.<br />Published in 1883, this book has a long history of being banned in schools because of its depiction of Jim, as well as the liberal use of the \\"N\\" word to describe African Americans.  However, a close reading of the book will see that Huckleberry recognizes the [cruelty] of slavery. Also, Jim keeps his dignity throughout while white men show up as cruel or foolish by contrast. Jim might be a slave, but he shows a deep humanity and the reader cannot help but identify with his plight.<br />I loved the book and found I couldn't put it down.  It's certainly an adventure story as well as a journey into the world Mark Twain knew during his boyhood.  There were parts where I laughed out loud, parts where I felt a shiver of sorrow, and parts where I grasped the beauty and wonder of the Mississippi River and the countryside around it.  Always it kept me fascinated.  And, if the ending was a bit contrived, I was glad.  There is nothing like a happy ending to leave me smiling. I give this book one of my highest recommendations.  If you've read it before, there is no doubt you'll gain new insights if you read it again.  If you've never read it, don't miss it; it's a real treat.	2002-03-06

He never visited America, but reality is not an important factor in his work.  Rather, he creates a surreal landscape for his main character, Karl, a 16-year old who has been sent away from his homeland because of an unfortunate relationship with a servant girl.  Karl is a victim throughout in a series of improbable adventures, and constantly struggles through a confused labyrinth of streets and buildings and random acts of cruelty and compassion.  Always, he is under stress and the choices he makes keep leading to even more preposterous predicaments.  I was constantly annoyed with him and yet identified with him as he fumbled through his very uncomfortable life.  This is the only Kafka work I've ever read and don't plan on reading any more, even though I can acknowledge his artistry.  It's just too disturbing. But I still do recommend this book because it challenged and expanded my perceptions.  And I do appreciate the legacy he left to the world.	2002-03-01

In the 1920s, though, it was the hub of the city.  The novel is the story of that time and place as well as the story of Franz Biberkopf, who has just been released from prison after serving four years for the murder of his girlfriend. He then becomes a street vendor but eventually turns to crime and has one misfortune after another.  This narrative is surrounded by a lot of words spilling out of the author's mind including long surreal stream of conscious thoughts, references to Greek mythology and the bible, constant weather reports, and dozens of short side stories.  The result is like an abstract painting, one that is not only confusing, but depressing.<br />The characters struggle, feel pain, and make horrible blunders in choices they make.  Women are treated terribly but are just too stupid to care about.  Franz actually loses his arm when run over by a car and later is confined to a mental institution, but I never could relate to him, his world, or his humanity.  The author was a physician and a psychologist and the influence of these fields of study definitely permeate the book, which searches to understand the human condition and cruelty of the world. Considering when it was written, and the mood in Germany at the time, it is a foreshadowing of the future.<br />This book is considered a masterpiece.  But to me it was just the unedited outpourings of the author's slightly warped mind.  And yet, as I kept reading, I gradually got into its rhythms and appreciated some of its complexities.  It brought me to a world I didn't care about, and a way of thinking that is overbearing and pretentious.  I did gain a few insights though and I'm glad I got a glimpse of that world. But in spite of its few redeeming qualities, there is no way I can recommend it.	2002-02-27

There are some memorable characters here, from her loving parents to the native Congolese who laugh at the foibles of the missionary families. There are the two spinster women with a secret, an unhappy former ballerina who has trouble adapting to her life in Africa, and a Frenchman who loves his garden almost as much as he loves his constantly changing women. Through Grace's young eyes we see the cruelty of racism and the stirrings of independence as political changes are happening in the country.<br />At 261 pages this is a fast and enjoyable read, one that I gobbled up in two sittings, letting myself travel to the lush world of Grace's Congo and view it through her child's eyes. Mainly, it's about the people and she stays away from political analysis. She tells her stories simply and creates an atmosphere, and brings the reader right into her world. If I have any criticism at all, it is that some of the characters appear in just one of the short stories and I wanted to hear more about them as the book went on. But, alas, this is a book of stories, not a novel. I loved this book; it was a small trip into a world that is now gone and which I will never get to know except for my reading. And it sure was an enjoyable journey. Recommended.nd it sure was an enjoyable journey. Recommended.	2002-02-19

Odelia is in her late forties, single, 5'1\\" and 215 pounds.  She's lived a lifetime of prejudice about her size but, as a mature woman, she's not going to take it anymore.  She and her circle of friends have a support group and are slowly but surely accepting themselves for who they are and taking a stand against the discrimination against them.  Odelia is shocked and upset when the leader of their group, Sophie London, supposedly commits suicide.  And she is even more surprised when she discovers that Sophie had a porn website and shot herself in front of her viewers.  Besides grief, what's a gal to do?  What follows is a tight, well-plotted story, with enough twists and turns to keep me up past my bedtime.  I really liked it, and that's saying a lot, because I'm not a big fan of mysteries.<br />However, \\"Too Big to Miss\\" goes far and beyond the story.  With a sense of both humor and mastery over her material, Ms. Jaffarian has something to say about the politically correct prejudice against fat people as well as the bias against anyone who is different.  In the book, there's a romance between Odelia and a paraplegic, Greg Stevens. Gently, we are reminded of the humanity of these characters, while never once forgetting the strong story line of the plot.  We root for Odelia in her quest for the murderer, and we also root for her as she breaks stereotypes and establishes a relationship.  She's not only a good detective, but also an inspiration to anyone who has ever felt \\"different\\".  I thank Ms. Jaffarian for writing this book and look forward to her next. Recommended.	2002-02-09

Fatema Mernissi, a professor of sociology in Morocco wrote a wonderful book entitled \\"Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood\\", which I thoroughly enjoyed. Therefore, I was delighted to hear about her newest book \\"Scheherazade Goes West\\", and purchased it as soon as it came out. In this book she describes her experiences in Europe during a book tour and comes to some conclusions about the way that Western men view women. Based on the opinions of a few European and French acquaintances, reading some Immanuel Kant and viewing art by Ingres and Matisse, Ms. Mernissi thinks she understands enough to write a whole book about the subject. She surmises that Western men like to see their women submissive and silent but in the Middle-Eastern world, men admire intelligent women even though they keep them locked up. She uses literary references to support this premise and tries to sound scholarly with many pages of footnotes to beef up the scant 220 pages.<br />I couldn't help smiling at her naivety and her preconceived notions and then I remember that, even though she was a professor, she led a very sheltered life. This was her first trip to the West and it was all brand new to her. She just didn't get it, even though she made a couple of good points about a later trip to the United States where a thin and perfectly groomed salesclerk told her that any size larger that a 4 or a 6 was \\"deviant\\". Based on this one incident she immediately jumped to the conclusion that by slavishly following these fashion dictates, American women were in their own kind of harem. Give me a break! All Ms. Mernissi had to do was open her eyes and look around her and she'd see that women in the U.S. come in every size and color. There are no laws of the land that force women to diet down to skin and bones.<br />The book might have been better if Ms. Mernissi would have simply observed the differences, but her value judgments are just too strong to be ignored and her mind too closed. Of course she's entitled to her opinion and in a way I find it refreshing. But the young girl who was the central character in \\"Dreams of Trespass\\" and who looked at the world with wide-eyed wonder was certainly gone. Through that book I DID learn about her culture and I DID learn to appreciate some of the richness of the lives of Middle-Eastern women. Certainly, she has the ability to take a reader into her own world; she should just stay away from judging others. I'm certainly not one to say all is right with my own culture; indeed, I'll be the first to criticize our foibles. But a short book tour certainly can't give her more than a glimpse of our way of life, and a whole book devoted to the interpretation of her impressions is a bit too much.<br />I wish she had told us a bit more about herself too. She's now in her fifties or sixties but she never mentions whether she is married or has children or grandchildren. Her descriptions of her own family life seem to stop when she is about ten-years old. She gives the impression that she is single, but never comes out and says that directly. And her descriptions of men she knows in Morocco are always her male colleagues and never a husband or son or brother or father, thereby making men of her family conspicuous by their absence. Sorry, but I can't recommend this book. It doesn't even make it to the same playing field of her rich descriptions of her childhood in \\"Dreams of Trespass\\", a book which definitely does gets my unconditional recommendation.she's entitled to her opinion and in a way I find it refreshing.

Myth has it that he typed it non-stop for three weeks, using one long continuous sheet of paper.  I understand it went through several drafts after that but it still holds the immediacy of that marathon typing session, the staccato rhythm of the words creating improvised rhythm across the page with little, if any punctuation.<br /><br />The narrator, Sal Paradise, is on an epic quest, one that takes him back and forth across the country with Dean Moriarity who is  based on the real-life Neal  Cassady.  Dean, the reform school escapee who specializes in stealing cars, is Sal's mentor.  And it is the automobile that is their chariot, which keeps them constantly in motion.  Dean's madness is glorified, as is his ability to do whatever he pleases. There are a lot of drugs in the book, but liquor seems to be their drug of choice.  They leave the heroin for a character loosely based on the real William Burroughs.  Women drift in and out of the story, usually as one of Dean's lovers who he treats terribly. Dean treats everyone terribly though, abandoning Sal on several occasions, once while Sal was suffering from dysentery while they were in Mexico.  Sal, however, always forgives Dean, seeing him as a god-like hero, no matter what he does.<br /><br />There's more to the book than the story though.  The book is a trip, in every sense of the word.  With the simple force of his writing, Kerouac took me on an adventure.  With him I crisscrossed America, hitchhiking, walking, taking buses.  With him I sat in a car driven by Dean Moriarity, speeding for hours at 110 miles an hour and not even thinking about a seatbelt.  I met the pathetic women who loved Dean and didn't feel a bit sorry for them. I felt the quest in Dean's heart for his hobo father who he constantly searches for.  And, I experienced the jazz, felt the heat and smelled the sweat in the many small bars, felt my head reel from the whisky and the sound all around me, stayed awake all night listening to sounds and being alone with the music in a room full of people.  Yes, I felt I was there with the travelers, enjoying vicariously the thrills and the chills and knowing this would be my only entry into that world.  Jack Kerouac eventually became an alcoholic and died an early death, but I'm personally grateful for this book he left behind and the experience of reading it.

Obviously autobiographical, it tells the story of a Hans, young boy from a small village in the Black Forest region of Germany, who was pushed to study for exams so that he could gain admittance into a famous school that prepared boys for the ministry. Under the tutelage of the schoolmaster and the minister, he is pushed almost beyond endurance to master Greek, Latin, Hebrew, mathematics and other subjects. His childhood is spent in unrelenting study and he even has to give up his love of fishing. And then when he passes his exams and is admitted to the school, the pressure gets even worse. No wonder he gets splitting headaches!<br />Immediately, the reader is drawn into the story and we become the young Hans, and see the world through his eyes. We are there with him during the long hours of study and we meet his schoolmates, one young man in particular, a poet, who rebels against the system that is forcing the students to keep pushing themselves from getting crushed \\"beneath the wheel.\\" Young Hans starts to have episodes of forgetfulness and fainting and eventually has a nervous breakdown and is sent back to his village in disgrace. The inevitable conclusion is tragic.<br />I can easily see the making of the great writer in Hesse's youthful novel. He's a master of simply stating the contradictions around him without making the connections obvious. And his descriptions of the beauty of nature are wonderful. He captures the essence of the heavy price we pay in doing what is expected of us without question. There's historical significance here too because, as we read, we have the hindsight to know what later happened in Germany. And yet, we also see that there's a strong element in our own American culture that pushes young people to bend to the yoke of prescribed achievement too. There is food for thought throughout and this book is as fresh today as when it was written almost a century ago. Recommended.when it was written almost a century ago. Recommended.	2002-01-26

Through the years, he's written six books about his experiences. This, his latest, is a collection of essays spanning more than four decades.  Each can stand alone, and yet, together they form a unique portrait of Africa, its peoples, and the writer himself.  From the initial enthusiasm in the 1950s when colonial power began to wane to the destruction of that dream and war and starvation, Mr. Kapuscinski sees it all.  He keeps the reader right there with him too, and we share the heat and the dryness and the insects and even the malaria and tuberculosis that attack his body.<br />We all know that Africa is very different from the world we know, and in this book we learn just how different it is.  We learn about the African's identity with his clan, we get a feeling of his sense of time and distance, and understand the joy of something as simple as a sip of water or a small shady spot under a tree.  Always, there is heat, so oppressive that people walk slowly to conserve energy and do nothing but lie quietly during the hot burning heat of the day.  It's the keenly observed details that bring it all to life.  For example, the introduction of plastic containers for carrying water improved the lives of the people. Plastic containers are lighter and come in various sizes.  Children can carry water now, thus freeing adult women from hours of work.  Reading about this makes me thankful for the clean running water I take for granted.  I also learned a lot about some of the raging wars.  For the first time, I really understood what exactly the war was about in Rwanda and why so many people died.  And his descriptions of the various governments in Liberia and the horrible in-fighting was very clear.  I shuddered to read about so many murders in the places he came to know so well.  And there were tears in my eyes reading about the starvation and the reasons for it.  I'm deeply saddened too, because I see no easy answers.<br />The episodic nature of the book was both its strength and its weakness.  It's true that I got an excellent overview.  But the chapters skipped around, from place to place and covered a span of more than forty years. I would have preferred a more in-depth look at any one area.  I understand though, that his other books are more focused in this way and I look forward to reading more of his work.  I also wish he had included some maps as well as a few photographs.  In spite of this, however, I do recommend this book.  It really did deepen my understanding of this very complex continent.ause I see no easy answers.<br />The episodic nature of the book was both its strength and its weakness.

The author, William Brennan, describes this first novel as a tale of the impact of the Sacco and Vanzetti case on an Irish immigrant enclave in Boston. He certainly does succeed in this. The book is much more than that though. The first-person narrator, Emmet Magawley, currently a patient in a Veterans Hospital is a small man with a crooked back, his voice thick with a lifetime of cigarette smoke, looking somewhat like a tattered coat upon a stick. He has a gift with words, words that gently take me by the hand and introduce me to his world, that of the Irish American neighborhoods in the early part of the 20th century.<br />Emmet's unusual for his time because he knows how to type. He's uses this skill as a clerk in General Pershing's office in France during The Great War as well as in his later job as a prison guard in the Massachusetts jail where Sacco and Vanzetti are held. Emmet is related to the Irish politicians who run his neighborhood and lives with his wife and children in a three-family house with her relatives where family meals come alive with the aroma of corned beef and cabbage as well as the loud bullying voice of his brother-in-law as the topics of the day are hotly debated. Prohibition brings changes to the neighborhood as Emmet earns extra income running liquor, and I loved his descriptions of being on a small boat as it bucked ocean waves to pick up cargo beyond the three-mile-limit at sea.<br />It is only when Emmet's character is fully developed and the reader completely identifies with him, that we are introduced to Sacco and Vanzetti inside the jail. There are seven years of trials and appeals and during this time we are right there with Emmet as his relationship with Bart Vanzetti develops and we discover a great range of opinions about the case from the members of his family. This was all fascinating. And at this point I discovered that I was not only reading a book about Emmet Magawley, I was having a history lesson too. At 244 pages, the book is a fast read, mostly because I just couldn't put it down. The words have a lyrical quality and the story kept me hooked from the beginning. I thank Mr. Brennan for writing this book and look forward to his future work. Recommended.book is a fast read, mostly because I just couldn't put it down.

And destined to win even more accolades!	I purposely took my time reading this book.  It's not a long book; indeed, it's only 258 pages long.  But each page was so packed with new things for me to learn, that I wanted time to think about it all.  The subtitle is &quot;Economy and Ecosystem in New England&quot;, but it is much more than that.  It is the result of years of research by Diana Muir, starting with the surroundings of her own home which is located on Bullough's Pond in Newton, Massachusetts and branching out to include all of the New England area.  Written in clear, easy-to-understand language, this is the story of a place and how it has changed over the years.  It is the story of rocky land and beaver dams and oyster beds.  It is the story of Yankee ingenuity and invention.  It is the story of making shoes and shipping goods and cutting down trees.  I never really thought about these things, but now I could actually understand, right down to the manufacturing details, how interchangeable parts for clocks and firearms changed the nature of commerce.  I understand now how paper is manufactured.  And how a simple invention of a plug to attach leather soles to shoes affected the economy.<br />Best of all, the book doesn't preach.  Even though we can now understand the havoc brought to the environment as the population increased and there was a need for more manufactured goods and a system of plumbing and waste removal, this was all inevitable.  Yes, it does show how the lumbering industry destroyed the forests and the manufacturing polluted the waters, but there was also no turning back the clock on the industrial revolution.  The book didn't simple raise my consciousness regarding the need to preserve our environment, it showed me how and why in a technical way.  Finally, I understand.<br />It is not surprising that this book won an award as the best nonfiction book about Massachusetts by a Massachusetts author.  And I expect it will win even more accolades as more and more people discover it.  There are maps, there are photos, and there are charts and graphs as well as 36 pages of footnotes and reference sources.  And there's something to learn on every page, including some examples of positive changes that have been made as well as hope for the future.  I thank Ms. Muir for writing this book and I hope it becomes required reading in schools everywhere.  It might be specifically about New England; but its message is universal.

She draws a very poignant portrait of young Marie, 15 years old in the 1950s, who goes through the torment of her mother's early death as well as the joy of young love.  There are complications to that love, serious complications.  The reader doesn't realize quite how serious until the book suddenly jumps a full 45 years later and the rest of the story is lived through the eyes of Marie's older daughter, Nora. There's a mystery here and several surprises along the way as the reader learns the truth along with Nora.<br />Once I started this book I couldn't put it down, staying up long into the night to finish it.  It's full of insights and yet it never bogs down to over-explain anything.  In fact, the author's strength is in the carefully controlled understatements.  It's up to the reader to fill in all the little pieces that remain unsaid.  Swept along with the fast paced tale, I felt satisfied with the conclusion.  It was only days afterward that some doubts surfaced about whether or not it really could have happened that way.  The characters were wonderful, especially the young Marie.  For a short time I was drawn right into her world, sharing all her emotions.  In between the chapters there are various pieces of correspondence adding further depth. It's a good story, well told.

It is supposedly set right here in my own neighborhood, but he made enough changes in the landscape to make sure this is considered a work of fiction. The darkened storefront &quot;social clubs&quot; where men sat around bridge tables, drinking coffee are gone now, replaced by trendy shops and restaurants, but Mr. Breslin writes of an era when a gangster he calls &quot;The Fist&quot; held the City in an iron grip.<br />The book is an easy read, its 300 pages a jumble of episodic anecdotes centered around the nephew of the feared boss whose famous last name creates complications for him because he wants to simply go straight and marry his childhood sweetheart.  Mr. Breslin exaggerates and pokes fun at the gangster world, and the total obedience given to The Fist, his men even going so far as to take a second wife and raise a second family because that was the way The Fist lived.  There are also some very funny stories about a dog as well as some chuckles about bubble gum trading cards with pictures of mob characters on them.  It's the very small grain of truth to that weaves its way into the writing that is the heart of the humor however.  I especially like the part about the nephew getting a job at the Javits Convention Center, making big bucks as a member of the corrupt carpenter's union.<br />The book is lighthearted froth that shouldn't be taken too  seriously.  This is apparent from the cover art and the blurbs on the back.  The characters are stereotypes and there's no attempt to make it anything more.  Therefore, just accept it for what it is.  And enjoy.	2001-12-31

Since its publication in 1970, Dee Brown's well-documented history of American Indians from 1860 to 1990 has sold more than 5 million copies. Mr. Brown quotes from original documents, including translations of the actual words of the Indians as they made their eloquent pleas for justice in the many councils they attended and where they were deceived again and again by white men who robbed them of their land. Even though there's a certain sameness to the outcomes, each tribe had a different experience. The Indians didn't have a concept of ownership of land. To them, it belonged to everybody. As they couldn't read, they didn't know what they were signing, but even when they did understand, it was just a matter of time until new laws took even more land away. And then there were the massacres. I had tears in my eyes while reading about them, especially in the descriptions of the cruelty to women and children. The Indians fought as best as they could, but they were no match for big guns and well-equipped armies. It was an awful time in our history, one of shame for Americans.<br />Throughout the book I couldn't help thinking about the real stories it contained that would make great movies. There's the story of the Seneca Indian who took the name Ely Parker and studied to be a lawyer. Because he was an Indian, he was not allowed to practice and so he became an engineer. During the Civil war he was Military Secretary to U.S. Grant. Later, he was appointed Commissioner of Indian Affairs. How that all played out is a fascinating story. And then there is the story of the Ponca Indian, Standing Bear, who left the reservation in the late 1870s with a small band of people. Because of some helpful white men, his case was argued in the courts. The issue was whether or not an Indian could be considered a &quot;person&quot; and thus be able to live where he chooses. He won his case. But, alas, the outcome was ruled to just apply to his band and not to all Indians. There was often dissention within the tribes themselves. And deception and intrigue. In one case, a chief was bullied by his people into murdering a white man. Later, the very people who had forced him to do this turned him in to be hanged. And then there is the story of the white man married to an Indian and their half-breed children. The children all were able to read and write and there is a lot of documentation about what happened to all of them.<br />I just wish that somebody would write these screenplays. Surely they would be better than some of the make-believe hogwash about Indians that we've all seen. It seems they're either depicted as savage villains or subjected to too much political correctness. And talking about political correctness, I'm not sure about whether the term &quot;Native American&quot; is appropriate. As Mr. Brown's book was written in 1970, he referred to them as &quot;Indians&quot;. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; is a well written and worthwhile book. It's upsetting of course, but I am glad for the perspective it gave me. I think it should be required reading in American History classes in high school.

Written in the first person in the voice of 11-year-old Alice, and set in East Texas in the early 1970s, this is the story of how she and her 14 year old brother, Boone, deal with their mother's marriage to a wicked stepfather, and their mounting terror as they discover his murderous intentions.  Perhaps the most interesting character though, is a young cult heroine named Persely Snow whose claim to fame is that she poisoned her parents and has escaped seven times from various mental institutions.  When she comes into their lives, the story takes on an even more exciting dimension.<br />It is the skill of Ms. Hepinstall's writing that put me into the mind of young Alice, who resists her stepfather's dominance and who is a keen observer of human nature and the world around her.  I felt her fear, her anger and her frustration, as she and her brother have to finally flee their home in order to save their lives. The reader watches the mystery unfold and admires the ingenuity of the children.  There's not a dull moment or a wasted word as a full cast of quirky characters come to life.  There are constant twists and turns as the plot grows more complex, reminding me a bit of &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;.  I just kept reading until the book's satisfying conclusion.  Good characters.  Well paced and plotted. Recommended.	2001-12-29

It's about a young Algerian Frenchman, Muersault, who works at an office job and lives a dull ordinary life.  He describes his mother's funeral with clarity and dispassion and, as the story unfolds, the reader sees that this detachment is the general theme of the book.  He doesn't love his girlfriend but it makes no difference to him whether he marries her or not.  He helps an acquaintance commit an aggressive act because he just doesn't care enough one way or another.  And, eventually, he commits a murder and is arrested.  The trial then focuses on this disaffected aspect of his character.  The conclusion is inevitable.<br />I found this book quite uncomfortable reading.  As Muersault observed the world around him, I was caught up in it, found myself seeing it all through his eyes, trapped in his inertia. I entered his world and felt a weird kind of sympathy as well as identification with him.  This was very troubling. The little book packs quite a wallop.<br />Yes, I do see this book as a work of art.  Every word resonates with double and triple meanings.  And every word is like a hammer blow.  I read it fast, trying to shake off its impact.  That didn't work, however, because &quot;The Stranger&quot; will linger long in my mind.  This is the philosophy of essentialism and the book is a classic.  I just can't help the fact that I hated it.	2001-12-04

It introduced me to a world of the working poor in a rural area of Maine and I remember how it opened my eyes to their poverty. In &quot;Snow Man&quot;, Ms. Chute's fourth novel, some of this territory is familiar.  But unlike her other book, this is not a big rambling family saga.  Instead, it is a tightly drawn and fast paced story of an urban terrorist, Robert Drummond, a member of a militia, who publicly murders a senator in Boston.  Wounded, he flees to the home of another senator who is off in Washington, and therefore away from his home at the time.  Here, this second senator's wife and daughter nurse the fugitive back to health and hide him from the authorities.<br />Ms. Chute's prose is tense and clear although she has a tendency to use words like &quot;orangey&quot; a little too often.  She's particularly good at describing wounds and Robert Drummond's painful shoulder wound is a throbbing reminder of his discomfort.  But the rest of his hiding-out time certainly is pleasant and there's seduction at play here too, and not just on a physical level.  He's portrayed as a strong and sympathetic character and we hear his philosophy of life over and over again.  It's shown in bitter contrast to the life of the two upper class women taking care of him. For example, when he tells them his wife had to go out and get a job, the senator's daughter, who just happens to be a professor of women's studies, makes a comment about the need for women to pursue careers and get out of the house.  Then she asks what kind of job his wife got.  Robert's answer is simple - &quot;McDonalds&quot;.  There are constant references like that illustrating yuppie naivety about what it means to be poor in America.<br />I read this novel quickly as the story moved along well, but I  just couldn't get into the characters.  It seemed unlikely that the two women would become so enamored with this man even though he comes across as attractive and macho.  All the people are stereotypes, created by Ms. Chute to forward her own political philosophy.  In a way this is refreshing because it is a philosophy not often seen in mainstream fiction.  But I never really understood why Robert Drummond's frustration with his poverty and anger about corporate greed would make him want to take the life of another human being.  I wonder though, if I, too, am just being naïve.<br />Those who might want a glimpse into the thought processes of a militiaman might find this book interesting.  However, it is only a glimpse and doesn't go deep enough.  And the story, while well crafted, is basically superficial.ugh he comes across as attractive and macho.

Born in Kentucky, Robert Penn Warren (1905-1989) had a long and prestigious literary career, his huge body of work including poetry, essays, textbooks, history and novels.  &quot;All the King's Men&quot;, written in 1946, won a Pulitzer Prize and I can well understand why. First of all there are the words, lots of them, words that flow and caress and make liberal use of just the right tiny details to get to the essence the people he dscribes.  Never have I seen such artful characterization and I found I was re-reading some of these descriptions just for the pure beauty of the way he used his words.  And yet those words never got in the way of the story; they enhanced it.  It is also a piece of history as the author brings alive the South of 1920s and 1930s.<br />The story is about Willie Stark, man of humble origin who rose to power as a governor of an unnamed Southern state and is supposedly loosely based on the life of Huey Long, the Governor of Louisiana.  But the main character is really Jack Burden, the narrator of the story.  He's a reporter when he meets Willie Stark early in his career and is there as witness his political rise.  Later, he works directly for Willie and becomes a key player in the blackmailing and political intrigue that surrounds the Governor.  We come to know Jack through the people in his life as well as his own internal introspections and watch the swirl of events that grow in depth and complexity. Nothing is quite what it seems at first, and there are multiple sub-stories that unfold as the basic action of the book moves along.  And then, just when I think I understand it all, there is yet another and another layer of depth and meaning.  Everything has an effect on everything else. I found the book impossible to put down, thinking about it all the time, not only as it related to the story itself, but also how it applies to my own life.<br />This is perhaps the best book I ever read and I can't heap enough praise on it.  It is clearly a masterpiece and I give it my very highest recommendation.  It's a present to yourself to read it.  Don't miss it!asterpiece and I give it my very highest recommendation.

It starts in 1901 when the central character Ada is 10 years old, and she is deeply disappointed when, even though she has saved up her money for a doll with real hair, she has to settle for a cheaper doll that she doesn't want. This sets the tone of the book, which is filled with the realities of life's struggles and disappointments. It also deeply explores religion and faith as Ada's father is a former Presbyterian minister who has lost his faith and there is constant conflict between right and wrong as well as tradition and change.<br />The title refers to the vein of iron within the characters, especially the women, which keeps them going throughout adversity as they struggle through their personal challenges as well as the social changes creating upheaval around them. The love of Ada's life, Ralph McBride, is stolen by the trickery of a supposed best friend. He eventually does come back to her as a soldier off to fight in the World War and their two-day illicit romance results in a pregnancy, which alienates her from her beloved Grandmother. Later, after her lover comes back from war, disillusioned by his experiences on the battlefield, their marriage is marked with more disappointment and struggle as they leave their beloved mountain home and move to a large town. When the Depression hits, and her husband loses his job, she finds work selling gloves in a shop where her wages keep getting reduced and the family struggles to put food on the table. There's always compassion though for those even less fortunate and we get to know their small community of neighbors.<br />There were a lot of themes going on at once in spite of the simplicity of the words. Yet the story itself was so engaging that I was reading it on the bus one day and went two stops past my usual stop. The sense of place is dominant throughout and I was transported into the author's world. It was not always a pleasant place to be, especially during those Depression years, but I totally related to it all, and admire the \\"vein of iron\\" in the author, as well as in her characters.

John Steinbeck wrote this classic gem in 1937.  It's been a Broadway play and there have been several adaptations of it in movies and TV.  I was generally familiar with the story but this was the first time I actually read the book.  Wow!  I was completely blown away!  This is the story of a two lonely and alienated men who work as farm laborers, drifting from job to job in California.  Lennie is gentle giant, physically strong but mentally retarded.  George guides and protects Lennie but also depends on him for companionship.  Together, they have a dream to someday buy a little farm where they can grow crops and raise rabbits and live happily ever after. This, of course, is not to be as the title suggests.  &quot;The best laid plans of mice and men&quot; is a line in a poem by Robert Burns, which describes how a field mouse's world is destroyed by a plow.<br />Steinbeck's narrative voice is seemingly simple in his descriptions of nature of as well as the details of the bunkhouse.  His characterizations of the people are magnificent.  We meet the other workers, all loners, and appreciate the beauty of the unique friendship between Lennie and George.  We meet Candy, the old man who is outliving his usefulness.  We meet Crooks,  the black stable hand, shunned by the men and therefore turning to books for  companionship.  We meet the cruel Curley who taunts Lennie into a fight.  And we meet Curley's wife, another lonely soul who uses her femininity to get the wrong kind of attention.<br />There's tension in every word and I found myself holding my breath, knowing that something awful would happen, my eyes glued to the page, the world of Lennie and George deeply etched into my consciousness.  I was pulled right into the story, wanting to shout warnings as I saw the inevitable consequences. The ending was incredibly sad, but yet satisfying. It couldn't have ended any other way.  It's a small book, only 118 pages long.  But it is a masterpiece and I will never forget it.  I give it my highest recommendation.I give it my highest recommendation.	2001-11-03

Cote is a fast paced novel set in the tourist area of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, sometimes referred to as &quot;The Redneck Riviera&quot;.  Dolly Devereaux, a single mother in her thirties, works two jobs to support her 18-year old daughter, April, who runs around with a drug manufacturing gang and is headed for self-destruction.  But Dolly is determined to save her daughter.  This is that story, and it's told well. There are obstacles of course and lots of twists and turns.  It was hard to put the book down as I was drawn into the world of strip clubs, drug labs and tourists.<br />Not only were the characters sympathetic and well developed, but I also felt that I had taken a short trip to Myrtle Beach, especially the strip clubs.  The world of the dancers is made real, and I got a sense of what their lives are like, right down to the smallest detail of having to avoid a spot on the stage where they could catch a heel on a protruding nail.<br />Mostly though, the story is about relationships and a second chance to make things right as Dolly has to come to terms with her relationship with her own mother as well as her daughter.  She also has to look at her own life and the choices she, herself, has made and is making about men.  There's a lot of food for thought here but the story never gets bogged down and the action is constant.  Recommended	2001-11-03

It's been hailed as a masterpiece and some people think it's the best book of the 20th Century. I disagree. Of course, I do have certain preconceived expectations for a book. I expect it to make sense immediately. This is not the case here.<br />The first long chapter is written from the point of view of the retarded Benjy, one of four siblings in a dysfunctional southern family. It is all random phrases and feelings covering a time span of thirty years, mixed up and confused and impossible to follow. It made no sense and I found it extremely difficult to plod through. The second chapter takes place 18 years earlier and is also told in a stream of conscious style with an entirely different voice, that of Quentin, the Harvard College student obsessed with his sister Caddie's innocence and promiscuity. His death wish is apparent throughout and it is not surprising that he commits suicide.<br />I'm glad I kept pushing myself to get though all those seemingly random thoughts, memories and impressions because the third chapter, told from the point of view of Jason, is written in logical prose. Jason is the supposedly sane son who works as a clerk to support his mother, retarded brother and niece, the illegitimate child of his sister Caddie. The prose is all logical sentences here and the narrative is fast reading as the reader really gets to understand the sorrowful and hateful person that he is. The last chapter is also in clear narrative, told through the voice of Delsy, the African American cook who has lived her lifetime watching the demise of this once aristocratic family. Her life is difficult and she is always treated with disrespect and yet she's just keeps going, an example of strength and perseverance.<br />The edition I read had an appendix that the author wrote in the 1940s. It somewhat pulls the whole story together and made the reading experience complete even though there were still many parts of the plot that were never resolved. This, of course was Faulkner's intention; he creates the characters through their voices and he leaves the world untouched, exactly as he originally found it. It is complex by design and supposedly shows his great genius.<br />Well, I DID wind up enjoying the book in spite of its difficult beginning and I'm sure I would understand it better if I read it again. I have no intention of doing that though. One taste of Faulkner is enough for me. I want to read books that have a logical core. Obtuseness just doesn't work for me. I cannot say, &quot;Don't read this book&quot; though. It certainly is worthwhile to check it out. After all, it did win a Nobel prize. I just can't give it my highest recommendation.

This is a story of a Mafia boss and the boy he raised to be a gangster but has nevertheless rejected the life.  The younger man, Gabe, now sits in a hospital room as the old man is dying and recalls the old man's story and the lessons he taught him about life.  Alternating between flashbacks and narrative insights, the tale of Angelo Vestieri unfolds. We learn the secret that traveled with him from Italy; we see his lonely childhood on the streets of New York, the people who influenced him, his friends and his enemies.  We follow his rise to power and cheer him on, understanding what makes him tick and identifying with him.  And again get a sense of the crime culture in New York in the early and mid 20th Century.<br />Of course there's violence.  It's gruesome and ugly and awful.  But, like many other books of this kind, there are bad gangsters and good gangsters.  The bad gangsters are cruel to children and animals and say mean things to insult the good gangsters.  Certainly, they all deserve to die.  The good gangsters have a sense of honor and have suffered betrayal and tragedy and loss.  They protect the innocent and drink milk or coffee instead of alcohol.  They have good manners and keep a low profile and are always smarter than the bad gangsters.  It's stereotype all the way for everyone, including a colorful female character who runs a caf&eacute; and is not only a mother figure, but also knows how to use a gun.<br />Carcaterra writes well.  His words just slide across the page and make it all seem real.  This is the Hudson River before Battery Park City.  This is downtown Manhattan before the World Trade Center.  This is violence and evil without blowing up buildings or biological terrorism. This is nostalgia for the more innocent world of mob wars and retribution and revenge.  Ah - the simple life!  I loved it.  Couldn't put it down.  And will probably forget about it tomorrow. Highly recommended.bably forget about it tomorrow. Highly recommended.	2001-10-18

Walking through Grand Central Station to my office I was thinking about the central character, Newland Archer, and his thoughts that he could see his whole life laid out in front of him with all its boring details.  Fifteen minutes later the World Trade Center was attacked, and even though I was several miles north of the disaster, I knew that life would never be the same again.  And I suddenly understood the reason for Edith Wharton's title.<br />Written in 1920, Wharton (1862-1937), a divorced upper class American woman who had lived through the carnage of the War in Europe, had just returned to the United States.  With artistic subtlety and mastery of understatement, she casts a critical eye on the New York social scene of the 1870s, creating complex and memorable characters whose lives are ruled by the cultural restraints of their time.  It is a rigid and restrictive world, its social mores so constricting that every detail of their circumscribed lives must be adhered to rigidly or they will experience the fate of the outcast.  Here we meet Newland Archer, a young man torn between his seemingly perfect wife and the exciting appeal of her cousin, a divorced Countess whose very presence challenges the very narrow world surrounding her.  This is a world where talking about anything unpleasant is forbidden, and yet the skill of the author makes the reader understand all those unspoken thoughts that live behind the words that are never said.<br />All the characters live a life of luxury, fill their lives with trivia and are trapped in a gilded cage.  To some, it is more difficult than others and Newland Archer is one of these, struggling to conform and yet glimpsing other possibilities.  There is a constant battleground between this strengths and weaknesses and, at the end, we are saddened but yet understand the inevitable conclusion.  Ms Wharton has done an outstanding job of taking her readers on a voyage into the hearts and minds of these characters of a bygone era.  Highly recommended.inevitable conclusion.

I was born and raised in New York City, and, unlike many southerners, I had a dearth of education about the Civil War.  Of course I've seen movies and TV specials and read &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; and, more recently, Tony Horwitz's &quot;Confederates in the Attic,&quot; but it was this book, &quot;Maps of the Civil War&quot; that made me realize the scope of this awful conflict that ripped our nation apart.<br />As befits an atlas the book is wide and flat, measuring 9x13&quot; and holding a mere 160 pages.  Here, in this slim volume are numerous maps that were actually created during the war as well as photographs, illustrations and paintings in both color and black and white.  The copy is clear without any frills, and describes in detail all the actual movements and battles with their great human toll.  It's hard to believe how thousands of men would come at each other in close combat with weapons that had very limited range. And it's hard to visualize 20,000 or more men dying on a single day.<br />I found all this little difficult to follow because, as I mentioned, this is all new to me, and, with the exception of some of the more famous generals, I sometimes had to read a paragraph over a couple of times to sort out which side a particular general was on.  I'm also not acquainted with the terrain, and the maps were hard to read especially since they were all hand written and many of them concentrated especially on the troop movements.  I loved the illustrations and the photographs though and found I would stare at one for many minutes, letting myself go back to that awful time in history.  There are photos of the soldiers on both sides and photos of the land and the dead and the dying.  But perhaps the one photo that I remember the most is of the vast quantities supplies to feed all these soldiers in the field.<br />Wars cannot be compared, of course.  Each one is unique for its particular time and place in history.  What is unique about the Civil War is that it took place among Americans on American soil.  It painfully ripped the country apart and took several generations for its memory to start to fade.  This book made it all real to me and for this I thank the author although I do think that seasoned Civil War buffs would appreciate the maps more than I did.

The author discovered the diary that had been kept in sealed wax for almost two centuries by the Countess' family, and has been researching the historical period it covers for the past 25 years.<br />I was immediately drawn into the story of the young Anna Maria and the dramatic events that shaped her life. Orphaned at 17, she's sent to live with her aunt, uncle and cousin Zofia who is her own age. These two young women are very different and there is conflict between them throughout the book. However, the author's skill in developing Zofia's character kept the story from falling into the trap of stereotyping and these two characters emerge as complex individuals.<br />The story is rich with romance, intrigue, passion and love. And it's all set against a backdrop of Polish history. There's a bridge in New York City named after the patriot Tadeusz Kosciuszko, but until now I had no idea who he was. Neither did I think about how the events of the French revolution directly affected the rest of Europe and Poland in particular. I learned about these things in this book as I followed Anna Maria's story, my eyes racing over the pages and holding my breath through her many ordeals. It's a fast and easy read, and, in spite of being 608 pages long I yearned for more when it ended. Hopefully the author will sit fit to write a sequel.	2001-09-27

In 1666, when plague was running rampant, these people voluntarily chose to quarantine themselves and tend to the sick and dying rather than take to the road and try to run from this awful disease. Ms. Brooks does an outstanding job of getting into the heart and soul of what this experience must have been like and has created some full-blown and very human characters to tell her story<br />Through the eyes of Anna Firth, a young widow who is a servant to the minister and his wife, the happenings of that fateful year are recounted in excruciating detail, using the rhythms and language of that long-ago time. As her children and neighbors suffer and die, she is witness to the extremes to which people will go in a time of crisis. I winced at the some of the supposed cures as well as some of the barbaric customs and punishments. I watched her friendship with the minister's wife flourish. I felt the torments of the flawed human beings who struggle with dark inner turmoil. And understood the role of religion in their lives. These are deeply complex characters and unexpected secrets surfaced as I got more and more into the story.<br />I felt I was riding the wave of the book, unable to put it down and feeling I was walking right beside Anna in that small sad village with its shrinking population where fields lay fallow and apples rotted on the trees because everyone was either dying or tending to the sick. And then, just at the tide was turning and I felt the story was coming to a satisfactory conclusion, the author took me on yet another roller coaster ride as the last fifty pages changed directions, unearthing even more secrets and taking a turn that thrust Anna into a whole new adventure.<br />I recommend this book highly even though I understand it is not for everyone.

Follman, a technical writer makes it all make sense.  Like many people, I click away at my mouse and enter the world of the World Wide Web without a second thought.  This does not mean that I really understand how it works or what it is or even some of the larger implications of what it all means.  Now, however, after reading this small gem of a book, which is only 159 pages long, I see it all differently.<br />First of all, she makes the technology understandable by her simple and explicit explanations.  She repeats a lot of the basic concepts so that they really do stick.  Finally, such words as &quot;bit&quot; and &quot;bitstream&quot; make sense. I now know that HTTP means &quot;Hyper Text Transfer Protocol&quot; and URL means &quot;Uniform Resource Locator&quot;.  Finally, I understand what bandwidth is and the differences between cable and DSL and each of their strengths and weaknesses.  And, best of all, I can see how it all fits in with developments in the world concerning the spread of language and ideas.<br />Ms. Follman brings a sense of wonder and optimism to what we have now and what she sees for the future.  And even though she makes it simple, she doesn't talk down to her audience.  A friend of mine who is a computer professional thumbed through the book and remarked how much good basic information it contained.  I used to think that this was information I didn't need to know.  The truth is I don't.  After all, I know how to log on to a computer.  But what Ms. Follman does in this book is enrich my experience, give it dimension.  And, in my mind, the World Wide Web will never look the same to me again.  Recommended.	2001-09-16

I loved her book, &quot;Nine Parts of Desire&quot; which was about Muslim women, and I have followed her life somewhat as she is often mentioned by her husband, Tony Horwitz, in his books &quot;Confederates in the Attic&quot;, &quot;Baghdad Without a Map,&quot; and &quot;One for the Road.&quot;  I  find her an excellent reporter and in this memoir, &quot;Foreign Correspondence,&quot; she turns the spotlight on herself.<br />As a child growing up in a lower middle class neighborhood on a street actually called &quot;Bland Street&quot;, she yearned for a larger world.  And so she developed pen pals.  There was a girl from New Jersey, another one from France, and even one from an upper class neighborhood just a few towns away. And then there were two Israeli boys, one an Arab and one a Jew.  As an adult, she found these old letters in her father's basement and, now more than twenty years later, she decided to look up each of these people. What follows is the result of her quest and some wonderful insights into world events from a personal one-on-one perspective.  It was fascinating.<br />As a teenager in the early seventies she was aware of the new consciousness developing, even reaching her in her protective Catholic school.  She had an active imagination and the gift of using words well.  It's not surprising that she developed pen pals and that they influenced her life so much.  Her gift of words certainly reached me too.  I shared her sense of wonder and enthusiasm as she looked forward to each letter.  I felt her straining to break the bonds of her loving but restrictive world.  I felt her hopes and dreams and frustrations.  And then, later, I shared her discoveries as she searched out the people who had meant so much to her early life.  She writes with a clear voice, painting a picture with details, taking me on her quest to discover the world and eventually to discover herself.  The book is short, a mere 210 pages but she sure does pack a lot into it.  It's a wonderful read.  Highly recommended.discover herself.

Ellis, a professor of History at Mount Holyoke College, has brought history alive for me in this very comprehensive and tightly written book. Of course I've heard the names of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison. But they were just stale names that I memorized some time in high school and which I've learned a bit more about from visits to museums. I really never thought about their personalities, or the many conflicts they had to go through that finally resulted in the United States of America I know and love today.<br />There are six sections of the book, and Ellis's technique is to describe the facts and then go into detail about the background, the myths and what issues have never totally be resolved - such as what actually might have happened in the Alexander Hamilton - Aaron Burr duel. Ellis is a student of character and brings the reader to logical conclusions based on what each man might have likely been thinking during moments that are critical to history. There is the secret dinner hosted by Jefferson for Hamilton and Madison which supposedly set the location of the nation's capitol in Washington in exchange for acceptance of Hamilton's financial plan of assuming state debts. There is the great silence about the subject of slavery and the unspoken agreements to stay away from this topic lest it destroy the fragile new nation. There is an exploration of the meaning of Washington's farewell address. And, most of all, it is about the relationship between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson and how their fundamental differences effected the course of history. All this is absolutely fascinating.<br />Ellis is a good writer and knows how to engage the reader's attention. I found myself right in the that late 18th and early 19th century that was so important to the nation's beginnings. It was all not &quot;self-evident&quot; as Jefferson hoped it would be. There was constant bickering and conflicts. After all, this was an entirely new form of government being tested. And there were basic differences in philosophies. The path to the future was being developed as it went along. This must have been scary - and terribly exciting. I know that I felt all of that as I read this book and applaud the writer from taking it out of the specialized world of the historian and turning it into such a popular book.

The first part, which I reviewed<br />previously, was fascinating even though I thought it was a bit<br />overlong. I feel the same way about Part 2. There's good material here<br />and a wonderful story, but the author has a tendency to over analyze<br />and give long explanations of his philosophy and even write about his<br />dreams. All this is unnecessary because the story is a good one and he<br />tells it well.<br /> Part 2 is set primarily in Liberia and the lead<br />character, Maurice, has befriended and fallen in love with two young<br />African women of the Kru tribe. He also has to travel to outlying<br />areas to do Sunday church services. He describes all of this in<br />excruciating detail. The reader learns about the backbreaking labor<br />that the people endure as well as the terrible illnesses. We get to<br />take a fresh look at the practice of polygamy and what it means to the<br />ex-wives when the Church forces men who have formerly had several<br />wives, to divorce all but one. We understand the relentless search for<br />nourishing food and see first hand the impact that the Church has<br />brought. We learn about plain raw survival in spite of terrible<br />obstacles.<br /> Life becomes difficult for Maurice because he decides to<br />leave the Church. What follows are even more graphic descriptions of<br />the contrasts between wealth and poverty in the city. When he has<br />nowhere else to go, he is befriended by Mandingo Muslims and learns to<br />appreciate their way of life. Then, just when he is rejoined by the<br />two women he loves, there is a sudden twist to the story. And the<br />reader is left with a conclusion that never ties up all the loose<br />ends. That's a shame because there is some excellent material here and<br />Mr. Blaise is a good writer. In spite of the shortcomings, I do<br />recommend these books. They will give you a unique and personal view<br />of the world the author experienced. Just be prepared for a very long<br />read.Just be prepared for a very long read.	2001-08-29

Each of the<br />125 chapters, that are less than two pages long, includes an idea that<br />a single woman can do alone. All of them encourage creativity and<br />include such diverse activities as volunteering in an animal shelter,<br />skydiving, learning to brew home-made beer, taking a road trip in a<br />convertible, and even crashing a wedding reception. Each idea is<br />presented with humor, followed by a short list of places to go for<br />more information, including appropriate websites.<br /> The book, of course,<br />does more than just give ideas. It says something about the authors<br />themselves. These are women who enjoy their lives and are always on<br />the lookout for something interesting to do. And even though they<br />often humorously refer to the possibility of meeting some hunky guy<br />while learning to fly or going to a town meeting, this is somehow just<br />a footnote to the idea of the activity itself. There's encouragement<br />to take courses, learn a new skills, help the needy, and open your<br />eyes to the pleasures of just plain living. It's upbeat all the way. I<br />read the book all the way through but it can also be read by just<br />leafing though it or choosing a chapter at random. But however you<br />read it, I can guarantee it will make you smile as well as act as a<br />springboard to further inspiration. Recommended.	2001-08-29

It is narrated through the voice of Dinah, whose life is only hinted at within the more familiar chapters in the Book of Genesis about her father, Jacob, and his dozen sons. The bible lists the names of Jacob's wives:  Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah, but it is the skill of Ms. Diamant who breathes life into them.  She places them within the context of their time and makes them totally human.<br />Much of the story takes place with the red tent, the place where women retreat during their monthly periods and the place where births occur. I love reading details of midwifery and childbirth and the author made me feel I was right there, sharing the labors of the women as they brought new life into the world.  The book also shed light on the communal lives of co-wives and the unique relationships that each one had with each other as well as with Jacob, their husband.  But the story is much more than all this.  There's tension, drama and conflict throughout, and a violent incident that changed Dinah's life forever.  It was so horrendous that it sent me straight to a bible to check out the story and make sure that this was not something that Ms. Diamant had made up, because, after all, this is a novel.  Sadly, I discovered that even though she did make up the personalities of the women, the incidents she described are right there.<br />From the moment I picked up the book, I could not put it down.  I was drawn right in and found myself trying to read it slowly to make it last longer. This is absolutely one of the best reads I've had in a long time. It's an historical novel at its very best.  Not only did I love the story, but I also learned something about the time and place.  And Ms. Diamant transforms the long list in the bible about who begat who into a living breathing story of real people.  I give this book my very highest recommendation.  It's simply wonderful!	2001-08-17
1879339:US	52294653	R1R74131IBFORO	0375703438	176981054	Rules of the Wild: A Novel of Africa	Books	5	8	11	N	Y	A romance of a sort, with Africa itself	This first novel by Francesca Marciano takes a fresh look at the world of young expatriates living in contemporary Kenya. Her writing is simple, but rings with clarity and levels of meaning that go far beyond her words. Written in the first person, her protagonist is Esme, a young Italian woman in her twenties. She is part of a group of young people in an affluent white suburb of Nairobi who shop at the mall, meet at parties and drink, drug and sleep with each other. Esme, however, is different, as her eyes are always wide open as she gently pokes fun at contradictions and raises serious questions about her place in that particular world.<br />Esme's romantic involvements with two very different men account for the plot, but this book is more than just the plot. One of the men leads safaris and she is exposed to the world of the natural beauty of Africa as well as to the tourists who are always interested in the big animals but never see the smaller and equally impressive wildlife. The other man is a journalist, who reports on the carnage in Somalia as well as the massacres of the Hutu and Tutsi. His descriptions are bone chilling and stand is stark contrast to the upscale and privileged life of her friends. Esme's relationships strain and shatter and her honest view of herself is refreshing. She grows and learns and moves on. I identified with her completely and totally enjoying viewing Africa through her eyes. To her credit, the author keeps her focus sharp and doesn't try to do too much. She just tells Esme's story. Yes, this is a romance of a sort, but it is not just about the men in her life. It is about Africa itself. I loved it!	2001-08-13

Now a sociologist at the University Mohammed V in Rabat, Morocco, she has skillfully recreated the sense of wonder and observation of a child.  Her own father had only one wife, but she lived in an extended family with an aunt, uncle, cousins, divorced female relatives, and even some women who had once been slaves and who no had nowhere else to go. The term &quot;harem&quot; as she uses it, means the seclusion of women.  Her mother, who was illiterate, dreamed moving beyond the walls, but did not even have the privilege of simply walking down the street as western women do.  Instead, she rebelled by embroidering birds of flight and encouraged her daughter to get an education.  The household was lively, and I felt myself drawn right in, getting to know each person through Ms. Mernissi's eyes.  I was treated to their storytelling and home theatrical productions; I observed them sneaking up to the roof to get a bit of privacy;  I understood why the act of chewing gum was considered a rebellion; I left the walled compound in the city with her when she visited her maternal grandmother who lived on a farm, one of eight co-wives, who gets to &quot;cuddle&quot; with her husband only one out of eight days.<br />As I'm about the same age as the author, I couldn't help thinking about my life and how much I took for granted in my own childhood - such as the simple act of walking down the street and being exposed to the outside world through newspapers, radio and television.  This book provided a magnificent glimpse into a world that seems as strange to me as mine would have seemed to her.  And it certainly opened my eyes.  At only 242 pages, &quot;Dreams of Trespass&quot; was much too short.  I could have gone one reading and reading. And my only criticism is that it was only about her childhood.  I wished it would have gone on and described the next fifty years.  Highly recommended.next fifty years.  Highly recommended.	2001-08-13

She was from Denmark and had come to Kenya to marry her Swedish cousin, but even though the marriage didn't work out, she stayed on their 4,000 acre coffee farm.  In loving detail she describes her way of life, including some extensive descriptions of incidents involving her native servants.  Through it all her love for the people and for Africa shines though. The reader lives her adventures with her and shares her regrets when the farm fails and she has return to Europe.  &quot;Shadows on the Grass&quot;, published in 1960 is a much shorter work and describes her relationships with some of her African friends in the years after she had to leave.  Together these two books form the story of her world and stand today as both a literary and historical document to the times.<br />Ms. Dinessen used her words well. I particularly loved her characterizations of the native people who touched her life.  .  She had no medical training with the exception of a first-aid course and yet she doctored to the many people who worked for her.  She was also a fine huntswoman, good with a gun. There were seasons of drought on the farm as well as attacks by grasshoppers and she wrote about all of this.  Often her European friends stayed at her home, bringing food delicacies and wine.  One of the men died horribly in a plane crash and her description of his funeral and his burial was most moving.<br />Perhaps some of her views on the differences between Europeans and the natives as well as the way she casually killed animals might not be considered politically correct today.  And it was never clear to me if the man who died was her lover or not.  She also makes not one reference to her failed marriage; I learned about that in the preface written by others.  The central theme of this memoir is one of love, of a deep love for a people and a place and a way of life.  I understand that the farm she lived on has become a shopping mall today.  But we are all indeed fortunate to have her beautiful writings that bring us back to a time and place that is no more. Her words live on. And I thank her for them.

As he says in his preface, most of the story is true. With a keen sense of dramatic detail, his graphic descriptions made me wince and yet drew me into the story of the young man who came to Africa to find God. Instead, he found people living in abject poverty with no hope of ever improving their lives while the missionaries lived in a world of their own. The lead character, also named Maurice, is constantly going through learning experiences as he not only has to deal with fevers and an infected thumb in the humid climate, he also has to struggle with his own vows of celibacy as well the contradictions he sees in the world around him.<br />Perhaps the author only wanted to give the reader some background as to Maurice's character by including a flashback into his childhood, adolescence and student days in the Vermont, but I found this over-long section unnecessary. Without it, Mr. Blaise might have been able to write this book in one volume. The book also suffered by a lack of proper editing. Grammatical errors detracted from the story. The sights, sounds and smell of Africa were the strengths of this book. His descriptions of the marketplace and the despair of the people brought tears to my eyes. Like Maurice, I was frustrated because I saw how difficult it was to help. And yet I admired Maurice's self-introspection as he grew into manhood and found himself falling in love. Mr. Blaise's story does need telling. And he brings a unique view to the literature about the African experience. But Part 1 is 430 pages and Part 2 is 392 pages more. I do recommend this book however, and am looking forward to reading Part 2. But do be prepared to wade through some extraneous material in order to get to its worthwhile core.	2001-08-12

How could I not?  How could anybody?  That, of course, is what is making the book so popular.  The beauty of it is that these are not impossible goals for anyone.

Written by Leila Ahmed, a professor of Near Eastern studies at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the Director of the Women's Studies program there, it reinforced some basic information we studied from other textbooks, with a particular emphasis on women's role in Middle Eastern history. The book is well researched, with little-known documentation from pre-Islamic history on up to the present, citing what is known of ancient marriage laws and including literary writings and histories of some 19th and 20th Century women writers. Her particular feminist position is apparent throughout and there are no apologies for this. Often she writes about the veil and blames colonialism for using it as a misunderstood interpretation of women's subjugation.<br />The second half of her book concentrates specifically on Egypt and it was fascinating. However, I would have liked to see more about the other countries, especially as she got into modern times. I also would have enjoyed reading her insights about the changes and challenges occurring today. It is refreshing to see a serious work such as this written by an Islamic woman and I hope she continues bringing her skills in research and interpretation to the public. Recommended.	2001-07-25

The printing is extra large, and each page often contains no more than short paragraph or a single sentence, It's the kind of book you can read while standing on one foot.  It carries an important message though:  change is inevitable and adaptation essential.  He uses the parable of characters living in a maze who look for cheese to nourish them.  There are two mice named Sniff and Scurry who live by their instincts.  Then there are the two &quot;littlepeople&quot; named Hem and Haw who live by their intellect.  When all of a sudden they do not find cheese in its usual place, the two little mice immediately start searching for more.  Hem and Haw, however, spend too much time hoping things will change and looking for cheese in all the wrong places.<br />One of the beauties of this book is that it can be applied to all kinds of situations.  The cheese can represent anything that we have depended on for satisfaction in life.  In a simple way it shows that as one door closes, we have to find satisfaction by opening another door.  This can apply to everything - a job, a relationship, our physical health, etc.  It's an all-purpose feel-good book that's an inspiration.  The success of the book lies in a message that everyone agrees with anyway. We all nod our heads in agreement as we read it, and smile when we finish, knowing that from now on, we'll look at change with a whole new perspective. It might be an oversimplification, but it works. I therefore recommend it. But just remember, it says nothing new.	2001-07-22

This latest edition was published in 1998.  Naturally there have been changes since then. But this, after all, is a history textbook.  I can read about current events in the newspapers.  What this book did was to give me that background.  And it certainly is a rich background, one that I never knew before.<br />In clear descriptive language the author describes the Middle East before and after Muhammad and the basic beliefs of Islam.  He talks about the early Arab conquests and the differences between Islamic sects.  He describes the various empires and discusses the role of European interests and westernizing influences.  And he gives the reader a really good understanding of the various the countries and their shifting borders. Finally, he brings us up to date on the causes and conflicts of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Gulf War.  It is all fascinating stuff and I soaked it all up, reading quickly and absorbing the context, rather than the details.  Not a shabby accomplishment for only 362 pages. Recommended.	2001-07-16

I was also easily able to identify with the two main characters -- Matt, an aging Vietnam veteran who is still haunted by his years in a prison camp, and his younger wife Alexandra who loves her husband dearly. They are now fulfilling a lifelong dream, that of buying a boat and sailing around the Bahamas.  Little do they know that this idyllic life they have planned for themselves will be violently disrupted as they unwittingly become involved with a drug dealing cartel.<br />The plot is action driven and the bodies drop like flies, most of them brutally tortured.  It all feels real though, too real.  And Ms. Stafford's mastery of the details of boating and the waterways of the Bahamas add to this authenticity.  The story is simple.  There are good guys and bad guys. Sometimes they do seem a little clich&eacute;d, but that didn't stop me from turning the pages to find out what would happen next.  Good escape fiction.<br />One thought I had throughout was what a great movie this would make - casting it in my mind with my favorite stars and picturing the special effects of the boating chases.  Hopefully, this will happen.  In the meantime though I recommend it for suspense fans who don't mind a bit of violence.	2001-07-15

I like to read books in different genres though and so I was intrigued by this book by Shalanna Collins and was immediately drawn in to her fantasy world where a teenage girl is grows up with a father who is a practitioner magic in a town where such things are taken for granted.<br />Dulcinea's world is a fascinating one and the many descriptive details made me marvel at the skill of the author who set the stage for a struggle between good and evil, while, at the same time depicting the up and down emotions of Dulcinea's coming of age. I particularly liked her relationship with the young man magic maker who is forced to appreciate Dulcinea's skill in making magic when she saves his life on several occasions. There's a dragon in this book as well as a cast of characters that spring full-blown from the author's imagination as well as a sense of tension throughout. And the author's sense of humor kept the whole reading experience fun. My only criticism of the book is that it was a bit too wordy for my taste and I would have liked to see it edited down by 50 or more pages. However, I know this book will appeal to fantasy fans, and especially to young adults.	2001-07-15

Subtitled, \\"A Woman's Solo Trek Across 1,700 Miles of Australian Outback,\\" this 1980 book by Robyn Davidson, then 30 years old, is now considered a classic.  She did it alone, with four camels, a loyal dog, and all the self-doubt and introspection that make her very human.  Ms. Davidson grew up in Adelaide, a city in Southern Australia, but she traveled to the Central Australian town of Alice Springs, arriving with just $6 in her pocket and a desire to learn about camels.  She worked in a bar and apprenticed herself to a camel owner, performing menial jobs and learning all she could.  It took two years and half the book, but finally she was ready to pursue her dream.<br />She never was able to accumulate the funds needed to outfit her camels and so she applied for and received a grant from National Geographic. Throughout the book she questions that decision because this meant she had to meet with a photographer on several parts of her journey as well as an onslaught of unwanted publicity.  In her mind, the trip became less the pure expedition she had envisioned and there is much soul searching about this.  This is not the only thing she constantly reflects about though.  Throughout her 7-month trip, she questions everything, even at times, her own sanity.  I learned not only about the harsh Australian Outback, the pleasures and problems of living with camels, and the plight of the Aboriginal people she met along the way.  I also shared every nuance of her fears and inner journey, which was as complex and richly landscaped as the harsh and beautiful land around her and found myself laughing out loud at times at her offbeat sense of humor.  And I watched her change from self-conscious timidity to a woman who gives up so many trappings of civilization that towards the end of the book she walks naked next to her camels, her skin browned and thickened to a leather-like consistency, heavy calluses on sandaled feet from walking 20 or 30 miles a day, and so far from the former civilized accouterments, that she doesn't care that menstrual blood is dripping down her legs.<br />There's little background information that explains why Ms. Davison undertook her journey and I never really understood her reasons for doing it.  That didn't matter though.  What did matter, however, is that she is a living example of someone who made choices to follow her own personal dream.  And for that, she is an inspiration. Upon finishing the book I was left with the thought that if she could do this, anything is possible and I applaud this her for reminding me of this.

Scott Fitzgerald, set in the year 1922, is a literary classic and I can well understand why.  A mere 205 pages, it's a book that has everything - story, theme, symbolism, moral drama and great characters.  No wonder it's stood the test of time.<br />The early 1920s was a very special time in American history.  The Great War was over, and it was a time of celebration.  Prohibition was the law of the land and bootleggers and gamblers were making fortunes as everybody partied with illegal booze and speculated in the stock market.  In retrospect, we readers know that it all came to a crashing end later, but that was after the book was published and so the book captures the era in its own time.<br />The narrator is Nick Carraway, a young man who, like Fitzgerald himself, was raised in the mid-west and is working in the stock market in New York City.  His own financial circumstances are modest but he rents a house in Long Island next door to the flamboyant and wealthy Jay Gatsby, who throws lavish parties and whose background is shrouded in mystery.  As a New Yorker myself I must say I cringed at his geography, but the rest of the book transcends these minor physical details.<br />Slowly, we learn of Jay Gatsby's obsessive love for the wealthy Daisy, now married to the snobbish Tom Buchanan who is having an affair with a garage owner's wife.  Nick is a friend of this cast of characters, participating in their lives but yet standing back and observing.  He's a man of his times as well as a person who understands human character and foibles.  How the story plays out is a complex drama filled with passion and tragedy and including elements worthy of Shakespeare or classic Greek theater.  This is more than just a good story.  It's an emotional ride in expensive cars to an era filled with people we can all identify with.<br />I give this book by highest recommendation.  It rises above a mere good read and dwells in the realm of great literature.	2001-05-17

There are just a few facts known about his life, and nobody knows who the girl actually was, but the author did the best she could to stay true to the world of Vermeer and the Dutch masters of the time.  She obviously did extensive research into his art, as well as daily life in Holland at that time.  The result is this small gem of a book.<br />The writing is simple, told in first person narrative, by Griet, who, at 16 years old, became a maid in Vermeer's household.  Life in the 17th century comes alive as she describes the details of her daily tasks as well as the tensions between the various people living in the house.  The writer uses excellent character tags and paces the books so the reader just wants to keep turning pages.  Along the way, we learn about art and the specific techniques that the painter used for mixing colors.<br />It is a nice story and everything falls into place. Griet is wide eyed and innocent but just a little too perfect for my taste, however.  The other characters seem to have more depth. Vermeer is the most complex.  And so is the butcher's son who courts Griet with blood under his fingernails as well as Griet's brother who is apprenticed to a Delft tile maker.  Sometimes it felt like I was reading a romance novel based on just a few scanty facts and I was annoyed at those times, well aware that what I was reading was not necessarily the truth, but just a figment of the author's imagination.  At other times I felt I was right there in Vermeer's studio, noticing how the light caught the face of his subjects, sensing the smell of linseed oil and viewing the world through the painter's eyes.<br />I cannot make the book what it is not however, and do applaud the author for bringing this work of art to the public by means of this novel.	2001-05-13

Her skin might be white, but she's an African through and through. Jailed briefly and then exiled from her home in Kenya in 1988 because she wrote some uncomplimentary articles about the government, she fled with her two teenage daughters to the safety of London. She yearned for her homeland, though, and so she then took assignments to cover stories in some of the most dangerous places in Africa.  Along the way, she made her own personal discoveries and wrote this book in 1992.<br />I've read a few books about Africa but I must say that this is the one that really made me &quot;feel&quot; it.  Ms. Fitzgerald is a fine writer and her love for Africa glows from every page, and, in spite of its brutality, corruption, war and famine, I could also see its majestic beauty. She traveled light, with just the clothes on her back and a small knapsack.  She lived among Samburu warriors, she dodged bullets with rebels in Ethiopia, she confronted murder and poaching in the bush of the Central African Republic, she lived through the war in Liberia and she consulted practitioners of magic in the Ivory Coast.  Often, she feared for her life.  But always she wrote a good story.<br />Her descriptions and interpretations of events are specific. She gets into the heart of the story, setting the scene with her knowledge of history, politics and the details of the infighting for power. I was not acquainted with most of these facts and I found them fascinating. There's only 288 pages in the book but it's a dense read, with something new to learn in every paragraph.  I read it slowly, absorbing the information and getting into the skin of this slim middle-aged woman who wears metal bracelets about her elbows and feels more at home in the African bush than she does on a London Street.  I give this book my highest recommendation. Read it if you can.	2001-05-13

This early collection of short stories published in 1990 is the third A.M. Homes's books I've read.  She's a daring and provocative writer, who pushes the envelope until the reader cringes.  And as I read these stories I was very aware that they were just the foreshadowing of her later &quot;The End of Alice&quot; and &quot;Music for Torching.&quot;  .<br />She writes about a distorted surreal suburbia, where people are obsessed with sick fantasies.  In one story she humanizes a Barbie doll, and the descriptions of the abuse of the doll and a young boy's mastabatory experiences with it are chilling.  In another story she describes a young boy in a coma.  And in yet another, she introduces the vacant and disturbed suburban couple who she later develops in &quot;Music for Torching.&quot;  The stories are short and seem not completely finished.  Instead they look like little slices of life, or writing exercises as A.M. Homes developed her craft.  She's an uncomfortable writer to read.  She rubs her readers' faces in muck, forcing us to look directly in the sewer of human behavior.  It's a perverted and twisted journey into the American dream.<br />I should be ripping her work to shreds, warning people about staying away. I should have certainly stopped reading her work after I read her first book. And yet, there's something about it that appeals to me as it jars me out of my complacency about the world around me.  I therefore recommend her work for the adventurous, but if you're looking for comfort, you won't find it here.	2001-05-01

What follows is a detailed exploration of grief as she has to cope with some startling revelations about him and discovers that she never really knew him at all.  The reader follows her inner anguish as she copes with betrayal and loss.  It's hard to put my finger on exactly why the book rises above the soap opera genre.  The writing is clear and fast paced but yet sometimes repetitive.  The characters are well drawn but Kathryn is too good to be true.  And as the mystery surrounding the pilot's death unfolds, it is not quite believable.<br />But why did I go right past my bus stop while I was reading the book?  Why did I think about the book all day, barely looking at my e-mail and forgoing television in order to continue reading it last night?  Why did it keep me up well past my usual bedtime in order to finish it?  Essentially, in spite of the faults of the book, Ms. Shreve is a great story teller.  I just kept reading.  This book is not for everyone as it deals with the what could be called sentimental inner feelings and the thought patterns in Kathryrn's mind. Considering that it's about a plane crash, there is not much action.  And it makes no earth-shattering revelations other than reinforce the concept of how hard it is to really know a person.  But a book that can keep me so intrigued must be given a high recommendation.  After all, Isn't that what the pleasure of a good read is all about?	2001-04-26

The author, Tim Moore, is an Englishman, and he makes sure that the reader doesn't forget it.  His trip is patterned on that of a British aristocrat, Lord Dufferin, who sailed his yacht to from Iceland to Norway and eventually to the  town of Spitzbergen near the Arctic Circle in 1856.  Moore uses a copy of the travelogue that Dufferin wrote at the time for reference, and did some additional research by paying a visit to Dufferin's royal descendents for more background information.<br />All this makes for an interesting premise, especially since the author is well acquainted with Iceland since his wife is Icelandic and he is able to provide some interesting insights and observations about that place.  He can't exactly replicate Lord Dufferin's travels though.  After all, Tim Moore doesn't have his own ship and is making his pilgrimage alone.  And so he books passage on a number of commercial Norwegian vessels to get where he wants to go.  Also, instead of transversing Iceland with a team of horses, he opts for a bicycle.<br />The whole book is intended to be humorous as the self-effacing hero sets out on his travels.  Perhaps it is humorous to a British audience.  But, as an American, I missed all of the jokes and even though I read some passages several times, I still was not able to understand some of the incidents he described.  This surprised me because I have no trouble with Charles Dickens.  But his modern-day witticisms were completely lost on me and I soon found myself getting annoyed. Mr. Moore presents himself as an out-of-shape curmudgeon and proud of it. He complains throughout about everything, and mostly about his physical discomfort.  The reader is treated to long and detailed descriptions of his constant seasickness as well as every muscle ache.  Most of the people he meets are disagreeable, the meals awful and the prices exorbitant. He keeps going though, trying to prove that if Lord Dufferin could do it, Tim Moore could do it too.<br />Along with way the I did learn a bit of history and geography about this area of the world as well as more than I ever wanted to know about Lord Dufferin.  The author also did take me to a part of the Arctic I know little about, although he made it seem so bleak and cold and inhospitable that I have little interest in ever going there myself.  It's too bad I didn't understand his humor because it might have brightened the bleak landscape he painted. Not recommended, especially for American readers.als awful and the prices exorbitant.

He always felt different because of his Jewishness even though his family was assimilated.  Later, after a fractured marriage, he wanted his young sons, aged 7 and 12 to really understand their heritage, especially in terms of the Holocaust, and so he took them to Europe to discover their roots.  They looked up relatives who had survived the horror and still lived in Belgium, and from there they set out on a journey to retrace the actual events of the life one of their relatives, an ancient eccentric old man who gave them his diary as a roadmap.<br />In addition, in alternating chapters, we learn of Mr. Rose's Connecticut boyhood.  Not only does he describe the events, but he's able to recapture every nuance of feeling that must have been difficult to dredge up from memory. He makes fun of his orthodox relatives, he battles the school bully, but most of all, he keeps coming back to the recurrent theme of the book --his hiding places.<br />Foremost though, is his relationship with his own sons, and the unique loving relationship between the three of them.  Some of the things that they were exposed to on the trip were not pleasant, but they all came through it enriched by the experience.  This was a difficult subject to write about, but somehow Mr. Rose managed to do it with humor.  While I didn't laugh out loud, I found myself smiling throughout.<br />There's a lot of detail in the book, each one adding further insight into each of the characters. It's more than just description;  the reader really feels the emotion.  There's mystery here too as well as unsolved questions. And there sure is a lot to think about.  Afterwards, I couldn't get the book out of my mind and I don't know if I ever will.  I must thank Mr. Rose for writing it.  Highly recommended.	2001-04-14

J.J. Coetzee, the author, is a white South African and brings the reader right into his world.  The protagonist is David Lurie, a 52 year old English professor at a university in Capetown.  Twice divorced, he leads a solitary life, indulging his rather mild sexual appetite with prostitutes.  When he has an affair with a student, he is discovered and disgraced.  Rather than make a public repentance, he resigns.<br />This background takes up about a quarter of the novel, but it only sets the stage for what comes next as Lurie then goes to spend some time with his grown daughter in the countryside.  She lives alone, raising dogs and selling produce and her life seems simple but satisfactory.  Suddenly, there is an act of violence which turns their lives around.  Lurie is forced to understand still more aspects of the concept of disgrace as well as place all of this in the context of what is happening in modern South Africa in the area of race relations.<br />David Lurie is not a likeable character.  And yet he's a human being with all the warts and foibles that make him real.  The author's clear prose manages to unveil many levels of meaning as the reader becomes involved in the story. There wasn't a wasted word, each scene saying much more than the action revealed.  Every minor character had a purpose, including the animals in a shelter where Lurie volunteers his time.  This is not a happy book but the reading of it was very satisfying.  When it ended I wasn't smiling, but I felt I had gained a deeper understanding of human nature as well as a snapshot of life in South Africa today.	2001-04-10

We learn about<br />the bonesetter's daughter, the terribly scared nursemaid named<br />Precious Annie who raised LuLing and the connections between the<br />generations.  It's a story of betrayal and ghosts and a curse through<br />the ages.  It's a story of relationships between sisters and teachers<br />and mothers.  It's the story of healing and hope and redemption.  And<br />it's all so interesting that it's hard to put the book down.<br />Ms. Tan<br />is a fine writer.  She brings out some universal truths about a world<br />I'm familiar with as well as those of a world that has vanished and<br />can only be recreated by the skill of the author.  Her sense of place<br />is extraordinary and she puts the reader right into the skin of the<br />characters, building the story gradually and adding telling details at<br />just the right moments.

This first novel by Julianna Baggott is more than a fresh, witty coming-of-age story.  There are sharp insights into the realities of love and loss as well as some comic views of middle-class American life all told through the eyes of a young woman born in 1970.<br />When Lizzy Jablonski was 15 in 1985, her father disappeared one summer with a red-headed bank teller.  Lizzy and her mother then set out on a little trip of their own, their &quot;girl talks&quot; during this period teaching Lizzy more than she ever wanted to know about the secrets of her  mother's life. Fifteen years later, Lizzy looks back on that special summer with new perspective, realizing how much she is like her mother as she deals with her own life.  This seems like a simple story, but there are threads throughout that show a deep understanding of the human condition.  There were parts that made me chuckle, but it was a chuckle of recognition of some nuance of experience that Ms. Baggott was able to capture with just a few lines of well placed dialog or description.<br />The book flashes back between the teenage girl's experience and that of the 30-year old woman and lays bare the connections between the mother and daughter as well as the men in their lives.  The pacing is fast, the construction tight and the story moves along well, revealing just enough of the details to hold my interest and make me keep reading.  Reommended.	2001-03-28

He's a writer for National Geographic, who sponsored this trip, and he and his three traveling companions were thus able to be properly outfitted with the best outdoor gear and kayaks available for the adventure.<br />The trip took 25 days in mid-summer, but it sure didn't seem like summer to me.  The Aleutian Islands are located in the heart of the Bering Sea, in one of the most dangerous and stormiest waters in the world.  But the team Bowermaster put together were all skilled, experienced and strong men.  They kayaked from island to island, camped on the beaches and hiked up the volcanic mountains that dominate this small world.  They carried their food with them as well as camera equipment as one of the men was an official photographer for National Geographic.<br />The best part of the book was the well-researched history.  I am fascinated by all things about the frozen north and wondered if the Aleutian Islands as depicted by James Michener in &quot;Alaska&quot; was accurate.  This book confirmed the accuracy of the fictional book and even added more.  There are no people who live on the Aleutian Islands anymore even though they once held a population of more than 25,000.  But first the Russians and then the Americans discovered that this was a place to hunt for seal and otter and forced the people to hunt for these pelts.  After being isolated for thousands of years, the Aleuts had no natural resistance to disease and many of them died.  There was still a small colony in the 1940s but they were all removed from the area because they were being attacked by Japan.  Most of these people were sent to internment camps in Alaska and never returned to the Aleuts.<br />No wonder this place attracted Bowermaster and his National Geographic crew. Of course, in spite of being properly outfitted, there was still danger everywhere, especially since they had no communication with the outside world. And they had to paddle their kayaks for as many as 7 hours without a rest through volatile and dangerous waters.  Some of the time I felt I was right with them.  The map could have been better, but the photographs were excellent -- definitely National Geographic quality.  They captured the beauty and the isolation with a professional's eye.<br />Because I have a particular interest in Alaska, I did enjoy this book. But the writing reads like a National Geographic piece -- clear, concise and accurate, but lacking in real passion or interesting personal details.  The author tried to introduce a small bit of description of some tension in the group, but I had never gotten to know the people enough to really care.  I guess I wanted it to be more than what it was -- four modern men dressed in Gore-tex looking for adventure.  Therefore, as far as my own personal taste goes, I can only give it a modest recommendation.ere was still danger everywhere, especially since they had no communication with the outside world.

The author tried to introduce a small bit of description of some tension in the group, but I had never gotten to know the people enough to really care.  I guess I wanted it to be more than what it was -- four modern men dressed in Gore-tex looking for adventure.  Therefore, as far as my own personal taste goes, I can only give it a modest recommendation.	2001-03-24

This fun romantic fable is set in New York City where Cornelia Lord is a debutante with a quirky determination to right an old wrong done by her family.  Kevin Doyle is the doorman of her building, but also an aspiring artist. Then there is the bad guy, Tucker Fisk, plotting to cheat the Lord family out of their fortune by marrying Cornelia.<br />The craftsmanship of the author is apparent. There's not a wasted word as the story flows smoothly along, capturing the reader's complete attention. I, myself, got so involved in reading it that I once went right by my stop on the subway and didn't even notice till I was way uptown. The characterizations are wonderful, even for the secondary ones.  I especially loved Kevin's sister, Marne, a tomboy firefighter; Roni,a woman who drives a horse-drawn carriage in Central Park; and Cornelia's father, Chester Lord, the personification of a poor rich man.<br />The author's crisp clear style of writing sparkles with the electricity which is a running theme throughout the book.  Cornelia is obsessed with an obscure inventor who supposedly created electricity;  Kevin does neon sculpture;  there's a mental hospital surrounded by electric wires where electro-shock treatment is given.  And then there is Cornelia's unique ability to see electric aura's around people.  Along the way, I also learned something about neon sculpture. There's humor in the book too and I found myself smiling outright at times. It's always quite visual and I kept picturing what fun it would be as a movie, especially the last madcap scene. Recommended.	2001-03-16

Nahai is the story of the Jews in Iran, and one character in particular named Peacock.  Ms. Nahai did a lot of research and it rings with both historical accuracy and as well as a bit of magic realism. The story begins more than two hundred years ago when Iran was called Persia.  There are harems and ghettos and child marriage.  There is vast wealth and grinding poverty.  People are locked into rigid social patterns that they cannot escape.  Jews are treated as outcasts but yet sometimes intermarry.  Cruelty is everywhere.<br />Ms. Nahai creates her characters well;  each is an individual and yet is representative of a culture and a way of life that has existed for centuries and has remained largely unexplored in western literature.  We meet Esther the soothsayer and her descendents, visit marriage beds and feel the experience of a culture where a man is allowed four legal wives and hundreds of temporary wives.  We see love and passion and feel great sadness.<br />I found it difficult to read this book at times because of the constant cruelties.  There was something to make me wince on almost every page.  Even the wealthy were not spared.  It made me wonder if perhaps the author went too far in her fervor to shock the reader.  And yet, I couldn't put it down. After a while I got hardened and focused on the rich and interesting characters.  And slowly but surely I began to understand the forces shaping the Iran that has emerged today.<br />Yes.  I do recommend this book.  But it certainly isn't for the squeamish.	2001-03-07

It was George who ran the race;  Ann was the one who drove the truck, carried the gear, took care of their daughter and gave him moral support through the long months of training, and eventually through the grueling event.<br />I've read other books about dog mushing, but this one had the unique point of view of a woman who, while not actually on the sled during the race, experienced her own Yukon Quest experience.  She writes clearly and honestly, not shying away from the disagreement that she had with the young woman they brought with them to act as the official &quot;handler&quot; of the dogs. She writes about George's experience on the trail, his frostbite, fatigue, narrow escapes and indomitable spirit as he pitted himself against natural forces over which he had little control.  She writes about the dogs, their personalities and backgrounds and about the tough choices she and George had to make when it came time to pick the actual team of 12 out of their much larger group.  She writes about the people they meet along the way, her Alaskan neighbors, fisherman, storekeepers and the other mushers.  And she writes about Alaska itself, making me yearn to experience its beauty and majesty.<br />There was one small line drawing of the Yukon Quest trail and I kept returning to it again and again as the book moved along and the tension mounted.  There is also a photo of Ms. Cook and one of her dogs on the back cover.  I wish there were more photos, but I didn't really need them because her descriptions were so clear. Recommended.	2001-03-03

This novel by Amistead Maupin is one of those books that I just couldn't put down. It's written as if it were an autobiography and it draws the reader in to a story which becomes more complex as it moves along.  It's about Gabriel Noone, a successful writer in his fifties, whose late-night radio stories have brought him a wide audience.  He's in the midst of a breakup with his younger longtime companion and is grappling with its realities, when a publisher sends him a manuscript written by 13-year old boy, Pete Lomax, now dying of AIDS, who has been horribly abused.<br />Gradually, a telephone relationship develops between the narrator and the boy who helps the aging writer gain insights into his own life.  The plot thickens, however, when some troubling questions arise about who the boy actually is and Gabriel Noone is set on a whirlwind trip of discovery which leads him from San Francisco to the heartland of Wisconsin and then to his own boyhood home in Charleston, South Carolina.  The reader is gently brought to understand the man and his way of life completely, sharing his discoveries and his angst along the way. There's fine writing here, an intriguing story and a conclusion that will leave you thinking for a long time.  Recommended.<br />As an afterthought, I must mention that the graphic design of the hardcover edition is one of the most original I have ever seen.	2001-03-03

This is a memoir of the author's boyhood and young manhood in Ethiopia.  Born in 1958 to a middle-class family in the city of Jijiga, Mr. Mezlekia left Ethiopia in 1980 and is now a professional engineer living in Toronto.  Narrated with a light touch and a mixture of myth and fantasy, he opens a world for the western reader that has too long been influenced by nothing more than photos of skeletal images of starving children and grinding poverty.<br />This story, however, is much more than that.  From the start, there's a wide variety of interesting characters and a rich warm family life.  There's Mustafa, the swindler, who boards at his home; there's Mr. Alula, the teacher, whose severe forms of discipline call for retribution by boyhood pranks; there's Wondwossen, his childhood companion, who joins a guerilla army with him;  there are his sisters who never stop feuding.  But most memorable of all is his mother, who holds her family together during the extreme hardships which inevitably come to this violent and war-torn land.<br />He was 14 yeas old in 1972, a time when idealism and student protests were sweeping the globe.  In Ethiopia, however, students were gunned down and murdered.  Young Nega was jailed often and regularly, and always tortured, but somehow his descriptions of this time in his life are told with a touch of lightness.  Years later, in 1977, when over 100,000 people are murdered in seven months during the &quot;Red Terror&quot; and bodies laid out over the streets, he yearns for the time when they were all just simply tortured.  Throughout the book, I couldn't help shuddering at the all the cruelty. From the brutality of the schools, to scenes in the hospital where patients were beaten, to the way that monkeys were slaughtered, I found it disturbing how easily such things were taken for granted.<br />Although Mr. Mezlekia does his best to describe the political situation, I found it hard to follow the various juntas and guerillas and political parties.  The fantasies and myths, which I usually don't care for in literature, seemed very right for this book however.  It was a constant reminder to me that this story did not come from a western author. Mr. Mezlekia is truly a witness to his times. He has certainly widened my understanding of his world.rties.

The story is of  an American woman, married to an Iranian who travel to Iran with their small son.  A few years ago I saw a movie called &quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot; with Sally Fields about the same theme.  I remember how much I identified with the American woman as I did in this book.<br />The book is short and not well written.  The story has been told before.  I was impatient throughout, but yet fascinated by the descriptions of Iran, and the thinking of the people.  The book needed editing.  There are basic writing flaws.  Too much use of the phrases like &quot;he obviously felt&quot; instead of just describing how the character felt.  And while I did understand more about Iran, it was all on the surface and the characters were stereotyped and never came across as particular individuals.<br />I couldn't seem to put the book down but I attribute that more to my thirst for knowledge than the skill of the author.  I think it would be a good &quot;young adult&quot; book for those interested in learning more about Iran. Otherwise, I can't recommend it.	2001-02-24

Many of them were later published in a wide<br />variety of periodicals, but it is only now that &quot;The Christmas<br />Story Pastor,&quot; as he likes to be called, has put them together<br />into this little gem of a book.  He might have written them for<br />churchgoers, but I'm as far from a churchgoer as a person can get.  I<br />have a secular Jewish background and live in New York City, where the<br />word &quot;church&quot; makes me think of Saint Patrick's Cathedral.<br />The small town church culture of Americana is an area I've only<br />explored in books but have never experienced up close and<br />personal.<br />Only 95 pages long, with easy-to-read print, I took the<br />book to the gym to read while using the exercise bike. I was so<br />touched that my eyes welled up with tears and I had to put the book<br />away to continue exercising.  I finished the book within the next two<br />days, taking my time because I wanted to savor them.  Stories are<br />short, no more than a few pages each, and all set in small towns at<br />Christmas time.  The people are real, characterized by just a few<br />simple words, and thrust into situations that display their goodness<br />when faced with choices.  I particularly loved a story in which a<br />boxcar of elephants, on route to the circus, gets stuck on the tracks<br />one Christmas Eve and formerly hostile ethnic groups pull together to<br />save the elephants.  Another favorite is about a teenager and a<br />homeless man. Mostly, I found them all fine stories with the exception<br />of two in which animals talk to each other as if they were human<br />beings.<br />All of the stories have an inspiring message and there's a<br />aura of love around them.  They were clearly written to reflect the<br />best we can be.  How refreshing!  I recommend this book, which is<br />suitable for children and very easy to read.  And you don't have to be<br />Christian to enjoy it.	2001-02-16

Homes is a gifted writer who makes her readers squirm.  In &quot;The End of Alice,&quot; she paints a disturbingly twisted portrait of a pedophile.  And now, in &quot;Music for Torching,&quot; she gives us a savagely funny and sad portrait of the underbelly of suburban life.  She has a gift of drawing the reader in, making us love, hate and identify with her characters.  Her dialogue is knife sharp with multi-layered meanings, her situations seem real but yet out of proportion and the book reads like a reflection in a distorted fun house mirror.<br />Paul and Elaine, a married couple in Westchester, are bored and frustrated with their lives.  On a whim, they set fire to their house and spend the night in a motel with their two young sons.  Instead of this being the ultimate act of freedom for them, however, it is the beginning of an even tighter trap as the house is only damaged, not completely destroyed and they are thrust into a whirlwind of savagely funny and sad  relationships with their own children, their neighbors and their respective lovers.<br />There's violence, graphic sex and moments of internal terror and confusion for Paul and Elaine as their life spins out of control.  They are pathetically flawed and yet sympathetic human beings and reflect moods and emotions that we'd rather not admit might lurk under the surface. Ultimately, the book concludes with an senseless act of violence that reminds of some recent lurid headlines.  All of this is woven together seamlessly with a story that moves so quickly that it's only after the book was finished and it continued to haunt me that I could look back and see the depth of Ms. Homes' understanding of the simmering volcanic cesspool of human emotions that lie festering under the surface.<br />This book is uncomfortable to read and not for everybody, but I thought it was excellent and intend to read some of this author's earlier work. Recommended.	2001-02-13
2114774:US	52294653	R2TITYTBNKZBPY	020530902X	241676942	The Elements of Style, Fourth Edition	Books	5	92	116	N	N	If you can get past the attitude, there's a lot to learn	In 1919 when William Strunk Jr. was an English professor at Cornell, he self-published this small volume and used it as a required textbook.  One of his students was E.B. White who later wrote the children's classic, &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; and was also a columnist for the New Yorker.  In 1957, Mr. White made some slight revisions and had &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; republished.  The result, as they say, is history.  Now in its fourth edition, this small book has become a classic.  I know I must have learned my grammar in elementary school, but I have no recollection of actual lessons.  I don't think I ever did learn terms such as adjectival modifier, adverbial phrase, split infinitive, intransitive verb or participial phrase.  My teachers must have done a good job though, because grammar has never been a problem for me.<br />Only 85 pages long, this book was a good refresher course for me.  It emphasizes clarity and conciseness and certainly is a good example of this concept itself.  Of course it's not easy subway reading;  grammar rules do tend to be rather boring.  I can't help but picture a rather stuffy old man with a condescending attitude standing at a lectern and giving his own rule for the use of the word &quot;prestigious&quot; which he considers an adjective of last resort.  &quot;It's in the dictionary,&quot; he says,  &quot;but that doesn't mean you have to use it&quot;.  I'm not a big fan of this kind of wit, although it does make the lessons he teaches more palatable.  He's a product of another era, when students held their professors in reverence.  It was the style then to talk down to students and I don't like being talked down to, even in a little book and by a man who's been dead since 1946.<br />But it's not about the messenger;  it's about the message.  And Professor Strunk had something to important to say.  He made a good case for clarity. I applaud that.  Much of what I already believe was reinforced.  In spite of myself, I did learn a lot.  And getting the essence of English grammar and style into so few pages is a feat of genius. I highly recommend this book.  If you can get past the attitude you will find it can even apply to e-mail correspondence. Take advantage of the learning experience.  You won't be sorry.arn a lot.

But &quot;Prodigal Summer&quot; rises to the challenge and pulls the reader in with the same lush narrative voice that rings throughout all her work.  I looked up the word &quot;prodigal&quot; in the dictionary.  It has two different meanings.  One is &quot;exceedingly or recklessly wasteful.&quot;  The other is &quot;extremely abundant.&quot;  Herein lies the rich theme of the book as it describes one special summer in a place that is a &quot;wrinkle on the map that lies between farms and wildness.&quot;  This is new territory for me.  I live in New York City and I find the natural world fascinating, but yet a bit overwhelming.  In this book, however, Ms. Kingsolver makes sure I understand it all.<br />There are three interweaving stories. There's a wildlife biologist who works for the Park Service and lives alone in a cabin in the forest.  She's been there two years and loves her solitary life; then she meets a young hunter. Down in the valley, there's a young widow who is learning about what it takes to run a farm.  And a few miles away are some elderly neighbors who are constantly bickering about the world around them that they never expected.  Each of these characters was so richly developed that I could anticipate their every thought while still feeling the tension of their grappling with each other, the environment and themselves.<br />The environment itself is a driving force. The wind on their skin, the scents in their nostrils, the air they breath, and their place in the natural world are not only described poetically, but move the story forward. There are facts in this book, lots of facts.  I drank them all up as a person who has been thirsty a long time.  Finally, I really understood what pesticide spraying actually does to the environment.  The balance between all living things became clear to me.  And I was filled with a wonder and appreciation for the natural world.<br />Ms. Kingsolver is preachy;  there's no doubt about it.  She wants to tell a good story, it's true, but she also has other motives for writing.  She does that in all her books and Prodigal Summer is no exception.  Here, she teaches us about the wonder and beauty of nature.he natural world.<br />Ms. Kingsolver is preachy;  there's no doubt about it.

With these words so begins this epic tale.  Melville's words are many, rich with meaning and flow from his pen in torrents, using the character Ismael as the narrator.  The plot surrounds Captain Ahab who is obsessed with killing the white whale, Moby Dick, who has cost him his leg on a previous whaling expedition.  But this book is much more than this simple plot.<br />Moby Dick is about whales.  And there sure is a lot about whales --more about whales than I ever thought I wanted to know.  It's as if every single legend, every single description, and every single fact ever known about whales is included in this book.  Melville writes in a wordy archaic style; his sentences are long and complicated, his references are often obscure, he goes off on tangents that are hard to follow.  But yet I found myself getting caught up in the complex rhythms of his language as I would pure poetry -- just for the sound of the words.<br />Although the character of Ismael is forever in the background, we are treated to a long line of lively characters.  We meet the tattooed Pacific Islander Queequeg who Ismael thinks of as a cannibal and who is one of the three dark skinned harpooners.  We meet the First Mate Starbuck who is a voice of reason.  We meet the carpenter and the cook and the young cabin boy who loses his mind after of act of cowardice.  And of course there is Captain Ahab in his madness.<br />But even though all the characters are richly drawn, I felt they were mere players, creating the stage setting for the detailed grueling descriptions of the whales.  The reader joins the men on the whaleboats for the kill.  We feel the highs and lows of joy and disappointment and fatigue.  The danger frightens and intrigues us.  It is an adventure as well as a gruesome murder of the whale.<br />Most of all, I felt sorry for the whales.  Melville does a lot to humanize them.  They become more than just beasts of the sea which will bring wages to the crew.  By the end of the book I was rooting for the whales.  Of course by this point I had struggled through hundreds of pages of excruciating detailed descriptions.  I knew all about the oil, the blubber, the bone, the brain, the skin, the eyes, the sprout, the tail.  I knew the different smells of different parts of the body from perfume to rot.  I admired their strong fighting spirit.  And I deployed the brutality and wastefulness of their slaughter.<br />The pace of the book is very uneven. Sometimes it's even hard to remember the plot.  And in addition to all this whaling lore, Melville goes off on long wordy philosophies on the nature of man and the meaning of life.  His themes are repeated over and over and sometimes it seems that he never gets to the point. By the end of the book, the actual search for the white whale and the inevitable conclusion is simply a punctuation mark to finalize Melville's thoughts.  And it spite of the book's length there are just a handful of pages devoted to it.<br />Of course I recommend this book.  It's an enriching experience.  But it is certainly not for everyone, especially if you like clarity, conciseness and focus in your choice of literature.w.  By the end of the book I was rooting for the whales.

Carefully<br />researched, and extremely well written, this early 19th century<br />incident has been brought to life with exquisite descriptions. Not<br />only does Philbrick tell the long sad tale of the Essex's tragic<br />sinking in 1820 and the sufferings of the few survivors who were<br />forced to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive, it is also<br />the story of the whaling industry, the social and religious community<br />of Nantucket, and the influence this incident had on Herman Melville<br />in the writing of Moby Dick some 20 years after the<br />event.<br />Originally, it was thought that the diary of the first mate,<br />Owen Chase, told the whole story.  But in the 1980s, another document<br />was found which was written by the cabin boy many years later and shed<br />even more light on what actually transpired.  Interwoven in this story<br />are the details which make this book come alive.<br />With the eye of a<br />novelist, the reader is brought to the town of Nantucket, watching the<br />ship make ready for its voyage, and making comments about the green<br />crew as they struggle to make a good impression as they raise their<br />sails.  We meet the young boys as well as the seasoned crewmen and<br />feel their seasickness as the captain orders them to climb the masts.<br />We feel the conflict in authority between the captain and the first<br />mate.  We see the racial and religious hierarchy and the role of the<br />African American crewmen.  Our muscles twitch as we read about the<br />hard work on ship; our hearts race with a sense of adventure at the<br />hunting and harpooning the whale; our nostrils crinkle as we read<br />about the process of killing, dismembering and extracting the valuable<br />oil.<br />And then we are thrown into tragedy when a whale attacks the<br />ship and the twenty men are set adrift in small boats with few<br />provisions.  We cringe as we learn all the details about the<br />biological effects that depravation from food and water have on a<br />human body.  We get to know the crew as individuals and understand the<br />hard choices they had to make.  And then we see the rescue and we<br />follow the few survivors for the rest of their lives.<br />We also follow<br />the voyage on the well drawn maps and scrutinize the photographs of<br />some of the men, ships and woodcuts depicting the event. Then we read<br />about what happens when a whale dies on a Nantucket beach in 1994 and<br />find out how difficult it was to dispose of its remains.<br />After all<br />of this, we are forever changed.  We have a greater appreciation for<br />this small bit of American history and we are even more thankful for<br />the ease in which food is available to us.<br />Just as &quot;Moby<br />Dick&quot; has stood the test of time as a picture of the whaling<br />industry as well as a literary gem, &quot;In the Heart of the<br />Sea&quot; is destined to become THE authoritative book on the subject.<br />Mr. Philbrick has done the world a favor by bringing this fascinating<br />subject to light.

Ms. Wong, a Canadian journalist of Chinese descent, was a student at McGill University in 1972 when she convinced her parents to send her to China for a summer vacation. The cultural revolution was going on and she was totally enamoured by the philosophy of Mao Zedong and the cultural revolution.  While in China, she applied to Beijing University and spent the next year as one of the only two Western students.  At that time she totally believed in the system, volunteering for hard physical labor and even tattling to the government on fellow students.<br />Returning to Canada to finish her degree, she returned to China again for several years, working as a New York Times correspondent and marrying an American who had been raised in China by his socialist parents.  Because she looked like a Chinese national and by now could speak fluent Chinese, she was a valuable asset to the newspaper.  She returned to the West again briefly to attend the Columbia School of Journalism and returned to China again in 1998 to become the Beijing bureau chief of The Toronto Globe &amp; Mail. I'll never forget her account of the Tiananmen Square massacre.  She was right there, running from the bullets and then sitting on the balcony of her hotel which overlooked the Square and taking notes all through the night.<br />Ms. Wong is a fine journalist and the book just keeps getting better and better.  She has a sense of humor and is not afraid to make fun of herself as she was in her idealistic student days and her gradual disillusionment with the system.  She walks a thin line between being Chinese and being Canadian and identifies with both cultures.  She writes about the poverty in the rural countryside, she writes about people smoking heroin in a makeshift opium den, she writes about the inside of a prison and the way that the Chinese execute criminals, she writes about a doctor who specializes in penis reconstruction and enlargement.  The book is full of photographs too. There's a photo of her as  a smiling teenager in 1972 with her Chinese classmates;  there's photo of a body of a slaughtered Chinese soldier in Tiananmen Square;  there's a photo of her husband and of the people she befriended,  interviewed or touched her life in some way.  And then, towards the end, there are photos of her two small sons.<br />For anyone interested in China, this book is a must.  It is a delightful read and dense with facts.  I've read a few books about China but I learned more from this one book than from all the others combined.  I thank Ms. Wong for writing it.he writes about a doctor who specializes in penis reconstruction and enlargement.  The book is full of photographs too.

The<br />book is peopled with a huge variety of colorful characters, and the<br />immigrant experience of Italians, Africans, Germans, Mexicans, French,<br />Polish and Irish people are depicted with her skillful social<br />perception, outstanding dialog and overflowing images of the<br />absurdities, chance circumstances and cruelties of their lives. Each<br />of her people die grim and violent deaths, and live small and hatefull<br />lives.  There are dozens of characters and not one of them is happy or<br />finds fulfillment.  It is a dark novel, which is grim and depressing<br />with occasional comic elements which only enhance absurdities of<br />life.<br />As I got more deeply into the book, I found it hard to pick up<br />because I knew I would be bombarded with another sad story of<br />someone's useless and pain-filled life.  And then I couldn't put it<br />down because, in spite of this, the skillful writing would pull me<br />along. The stories are loosely strung together, with occasional<br />flash-forwards for one of the characters, usually describing another<br />future ugly meaningless death.  She's writing about the underclass.<br />And the reverse side of the American dream.  She does it well.  So<br />well, in fact, that her images of lynching, illness, accidents,<br />abusive relationships and cruelty are not easily forgotten.  It is not<br />a pleasant picture.  But yet, it is surprisingly refreshing. Perhaps<br />because, in spite of her deep and colorful characterizations, the<br />reader doesn't feel particularly sympathetic to their tragedies and<br />meaningless lives.<br />It's a good book, but read it only if you are<br />unafraid to enter a world of unrelenting pain.	2000-12-25

This 1997 memoir by Kathryn Harrison is the true story of her incestuous relationship with her father.  Her parents were divorced and there had been little contact throughout her childhood, but she had always been obsessed with him.  Then, after visiting her in college when she was 20, his kiss good-bye was passionate rather than fatherly. That was the beginning.<br />Ms. Harrison's writes in the present tense, with brief flashbacks and flash forwards, her language seemingly simple and yet poetic.  Always, it is startling with a deep underlay of sorrow.  The reader shares her turmoil, her guilt, her attraction to her father as well as her repulsion.  She's a victim, although a willing one, anorexic, bulimic and sad.<br />I've read two of her other books, &quot;Poison&quot; and &quot;The Binding Chair&quot;.  I loved both of them.  And now that I've read this memoir, I've come to know her more and understand the deep well of discomfort which is present in her writing.  Now a wife and mother, and a writer of some renown, I admire the courage it took for her to write this book and come to terms with the demons of her past.  A mere 207 pages of large print, this book can be easily read in one sitting.  Like her other books, it's not a pleasant read but yet very worthwhile.  I definitely recommend it.	2000-12-19

Named one of the best books of 1999 by the Los Angeles Times and the<br />winner of the Bay Area Book Review Award for Fiction, this novel, by<br />Alfredo Vea, is not just a good book; it is a work of art. Born in a<br />migrant worker family in Arizona, Mr. Vea served in Vietnam and then<br />put himself through law school.  His understanding of the job of a<br />public defender, the peculiar horrors of the Vietnam war, and the<br />racism and violence in our society go far beyond the surface.  It<br />comes from deep within and takes the form of surreal poetic prose.<br />I found myself gripped in its magic.<br />The story is ambitious and<br />complex. There's a Mexican-American attorney at its center, who is<br />charged with defending a young African-American boy for a double<br />murder. This is just the barest outline of the story which includes an<br />excellent portrait of the San Francisco legal system and its<br />lawyers. The two victims of the crime are a North Vietnamese woman and<br />an African American woman who are opening a restaurant together in a<br />slum of San Francisco.  There's a bond between these two women that go<br />beyond the fact that each of them have lost husbands and Vietnam.  The<br />depth to which the author takes their characterization goes to levels<br />I have never seen explored before.<br />The book moves along as the<br />connections between the well defined and poetically described<br />characters weave together in a tapestry that is nothing short of pure<br />genus.  The writer has a mastery of words and images as well the<br />courage to take chances.  The reader must suspend disbelief a bit; but<br />it is worth it.  I found myself mesmerized by the swirling words and<br />images which keep the tension high with action, insights, and<br />multi-leveled metaphors.  Gods Go Begging is nothing short of a<br />literary masterpiece and I give it my very highest recommendation.	2000-12-19

Picciarelli has it all<br />-- action, authenticity, plot, and unique memorable characters.  It's<br />also set in the New York City that I love, and the places are very<br />real to me.<br />The very first chapter sets the tone with a graphic and<br />brutal description of a double murder.  And from that point on it's<br />hard to put the book down because there are constant surprises and<br />twists and turns of the plot.  The cast of characters include a psycho<br />former policewoman, a radio talk show shock jock and an ailing retired<br />cop.  And then there is Ray Yale, the private investigator who is<br />hired to solve the murder nine years after it has been committed.<br />He's strong and tough as well as sensitive. I loved him<br />immediately.<br />Mr. Picciarelli is a retired police lieutenant himself<br />and is now a private investigator with an excellent command of<br />language and knowledge of weapons. His use of police jargon adds<br />realism to the story and his descriptions of even the most minor<br />characters made them jump right off the page.<br />I usually fall asleep<br />while reading but this book kept me wide awake way into the wee hours<br />because I just had to find out what would happen next. I look forward<br />to future books by this author.<br />Recommended.	2000-12-13

Vo, the author, really loves his people, and in this very<br />moving and personal account of the Vietnamese experience, the reader<br />is treated to a rare glimpse of a very special world.  It is a world<br />of deep family ties, a reverence for education and the strength of a<br />simple, hard working people who have suffered unspeakable<br />hardships. It is the story of a young man studying to be a doctor, his<br />escape to the United States after the war and his view of America.  It<br />is also the story of the people he meets along the way.<br />The<br />structure of the book takes the reader back and forth from Vietnam to<br />a variety of regions in America. By the details he chooses in his<br />descriptions of the lush foliage and climates of New England,<br />Tennessee and Indiana, his love for this country comes through<br />too.<br />Some of the stories of the Vietnamese people are harrowing.<br />There is the communist takeover and the prison camps that most South<br />Vietnamese men had to endure for 2 to 10 years.  There is the plight<br />of the poor people who fled in small boats only to be pillaged again<br />and again by pirates.  There is the story of families rounded up in<br />the middle of the night, forced into trucks and then<br />&quot;resettled&quot; in a mosquito infested forest with no tools or<br />food.<br />Nghia Vo is now a surgeon and the book is filled with keen<br />observations about medical practice in Vietnam and in various<br />hospitals and research facilities in the United States.  We share his<br />joys in a satisfying career and his sadness at the death of his wife<br />and his mother.<br />As English is not Dr. Vo's native language, there<br />are grammatical errors throughout the book. But it doesn't really<br />matter because his voice and his philosophy of life come through loud<br />and clear.<br />I heartily recommend this book as a way to expand our<br />understanding of the legacy of Vietnam from a particularly Vietnamese<br />point of view.  And I thank Dr. Vo for writing it.	2000-12-09

This first novel by Joseph Bruno is set in New York City in the 1980s<br />when the crime rate was at an all-time high and the crack epidemic was<br />running rampant.  Against this background, Detective Bill Kelly is<br />looking for a serial killer who is specifically targeting drug<br />dealers.<br />This is a fast and easy read with a variety of stock<br />characters that readers will find familiar.  In addition to<br />hard-drinking cops, priests, corrupt officials and drug addicts, there<br />are the really bad guys whose acts of violence made me wince.<br />I<br />found myself caught up in the story as it moved along, reading quickly<br />to see what would happen next.  The reader knows who the killer is<br />early on but it is interesting to see how he will be caught as the<br />tension mounts.<br />I do wish that the book had been edited better; I<br />found the typos distracting.  And it even made a difference in my<br />understanding of the plot.<br />Police procedural fans might enjoy this<br />book.  And Mr. Bruno is certainly an author to watch as he develops<br />his craft.	2000-11-30

I've never read any Dickens of my own free will.  I was forced to read &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; in high school and I thought that was enough for me. However, one day, on a whim, I bought a copy of Great Expectations.  I'm not sure what I expected, but I certainly didn't expect to love it as much as I did.<br />Dickens is not a writer to read at a swift pace.  Indeed, this novel was written in weekly episodes from December 1860 to August 1861 and, as it was created to be a serial, each installment is full of varied characters, great descriptions and a lot of action which moves the plot along and leaves the reader yearning for more.  Therefore, unlike some books which are easily forgotten if I put them down for a few days, Great Expectations seemed to stick around, absorbing my thoughts in a way that I looked forward to picking it up again.  It took me more than a month to read and I savored every morsel.<br />Basically the story is of the self-development of Pip, an orphan boy being raised by his sister and her blacksmith husband in the marshlands of England in 1820.<br />Every one of the characters were so deeply developed that I felt I was personally acquainted with each one of them.  There was Pip's roommate, Herbert Pocket, the lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, and his clerk, Mr. Wemmick.  And then there was the wicked Orlick. The dialogues were wonderful.  The characters often didn't actually say what they meant but spoke in a way that even though the words might be obtuse, there was no mistaking their meaning.  I found myself smiling at all these verbal contortions.<br />Dickens' work is richly detailed and he explores the nuances of human behavior.  I enjoyed wallowing in the long sentences and letting myself travel backwards in time to a different world.  However, even with the footnotes, I found myself sometimes confused by the British slang of 150 years ago, and there were several passages I had to read over several times in order to get the true meaning.  Of course I was not in a particular rush. I didn't have to make a report to a class or take a exam about the book. This is certainly a pleasure.<br />I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read.ting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being  transported.  Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger.  Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with  Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but  Joe redeems his debts and brings him home.  Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to  him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human  being.<br />Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together,  that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love.  But at the urging of others, he changed the ending  and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her  experiences and her wretched marriages.<br />This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers.  It has everything you could ask for  in a novel:  central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming  better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name  it, it's in here.  I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and  David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.<br />GRADE: A+urse I was not in a particular rush.

She also worked as an actress in Madame Mao's Film Studio.  I loved her novel &quot;Katherine&quot; as it introduced me to the reality of living in Communist China.  I was therefore very anxious to read &quot;Becoming Madame Mao&quot;, in which she attempts to shed some light on the life Jiang Chang, the wife of Mao Tse-Tung, often referred to as the &quot;white boned demon&quot; and known for her vindictive cruelty.<br />The voice of Madame Mao come through clearly in the alternating sections written in the first person.  It is here that the reader gains some psychological insight into the forces that have shaped her life.  These sections are always followed by a dispassionate third person narrative. I found this technique effective in telling this story.<br />The tale begins  when the young girl rebels against having her feet bound, and follows the headstrong young women through an acting career and three unhappy marriages before she meets the dynamic Mao and joins her life with his.  She craves his love, but is treated badly throughout her life.  There is always intrigue and betrayal.  Favor or disfavor is subject to whim.  The world she lives in is cruel and she lives in constant fear of her enemies.<br />I had hoped to learn more about Chinese history.  But the focus is always on the person and much was not explained.  I also found it difficult to follow the many different Chinese names and kept getting the people confused, especially since, with the exception of Madame Mao, most of them were not developed in  depth. I was also aware that is was a historical novel about real life people and kept wondering about where the line was drawn between fact and fiction.<br />Mao Tse-tung saw everyone as an enemy, imprisoned anyone who seemed to threaten him.  Madame Mao did the same.  And whether or not she was able to ever achieve true love seems besides the point.<br />This book would probably be most interesting to those who already have a background in Chinese history.  I can therefore not give this book any more than a very weak recommendation.  It was a good try on the part of the author.  But it just didn't work for me.y be most interesting to those who already have a background in Chinese history.  I can therefore not give this book any more than a very weak recommendation.

When I read her memoir, &quot;The Liar's<br />Club&quot; about her rough and tumble childhood in a working class<br />Texas town, I loved every word.  That's why I was so anxious to read<br />this sequel, which deals with her adolescence.  There are definitely<br />some differences between the two books, but I wasn't<br />disappointed.<br />The voice of the young Mary Karr comes through loud<br />and clear.  It's honest and foul-mouthed and disrespectful.  It's a<br />sharp-tongued blade that dares to illuminate the angst of adolescence<br />with a hard-edged sense of humor. And yet it brings the bittersweet<br />sadness of disappointments and awakenings to the page.  The reader<br />cannot help but love her.<br />This book tells her story from age 11<br />through 17.  It's about her friendships and boyfriends and coming of<br />age.  As it takes place in the 1970s, there are a lot of drugs.  Mary<br />is sent to the principal's office for not wearing a bra.  Mary hangs<br />out with long-haired surfers and does drugs. Mary gets arrested.<br />Mary's sister takes a different path than Mary.<br />In this book, Mary's<br />parents take a back seat to the peer group.  The story of their<br />tumultuous marriage, psychological breakdowns and heavy drinking has<br />been explored in &quot;The Liar's Club&quot;.  By this book their<br />eccentricities and foibles are already accepted as givens.  Again,<br />their love shines through.<br />I'm glad that Ms. Karr decided to<br />continue her story.  It might have been a little more episodic than<br />the first book and the events not as traumatic. But the strength of<br />her writing is not in the events, but in her view of them.  And that<br />is why I enjoyed this book so much.<br />The book ends when Mary is 17.<br />Hopefully, they'll be yet another book that will follow her through<br />the years.	2000-11-11

When the boyfriend dumped her, she stayed on in Canada and got a job in Northern Ontario  running a community radio station for the Ojibway Indians.  She lived in a log cabin, learned their language, and learned how to survive during the long cold northern winters. Later, she became a reporter on the Indian language newspaper, writing about forest fires, crimes of passion, and serious bush plane accidents.<br />Throughout, her love and respect for the Indian peoples shine through her writing as she brings legends and traditions to the printed page.  Her quirky personality as well as the world around becomes very real, as does her own inner journey.<br />She is a reporter and describes what she sees.  Perhaps that is why not every character she comes into contact with is fully developed.  But there are some Indian elders whose stories she captured in just a few short pages.<br />And her descriptions of the danger and excitement of being dependent on tiny bush planes made me feel her anxieties.<br />I thank Ms. Jiles for bringing her experiences to the pages of this book and introducing me to these northern native peoples.	2000-11-10

Ten years later, he returns to try to retrieve these journals. This book is a result of those travels.<br />The sights, sounds, and smells surround his narrative, whether describing a storm at sea, impressive architecture or the scent of perfume that follows the veiled women.<br />There are government restrictions, of course, but he still is treated with hospitality wherever he goes.  He joins the men in their communal qat-chewing sessions where whole afternoons are spent under the intoxicating effects of this slightly narcotic drug.  He hikes for miles over extremely dangerous terrain.  He visits the baths, the bazaars, the prison.  And considering the fact that he only speaks English, he manages to have conversations with a wide variety of people.  Always, his observations are clear and show his respect for the people of Yemen and their culture.<br />As an armchair traveler I was delighted with this book.  It was wonderful seeing the world through Mr. Hansen's eyes.  However, he is a man and so therefore his experiences were that of the male world.  This is no fault of the book or of his writing.  After all, he only could write about what he experienced.<br />I recommend this book heartily.  It brought me to Yemen, taught be about the land and the people, and expanded my appreciation and depth of understanding of a place I will likely never visit.  For this I thank the author.	2000-10-30

Their marriage was a happy one and their four children were raised in the United States but kept their ties to their father's world through lengthy visits to India and close knit family ties.<br />The word &quot;Motiba&quot; means &quot;grandmother&quot; and Ms. Kamdar has chosen to tell her story by contrasting the differences between her own and her grandmother's life.  For example, Motiba was abruptly taken out of school at the age of 9 where she had to live in a protected women's world until her marriage at age 15.<br />The family was of the merchant caste and settled in Burma during the 1920s and 30s where they lived a luxurious life.  But when War came to Burma, things changed.  Not only did they lose their prosperous businesses, but they were forced to undergo unspeakable horrors as they fled for their lives back to India.<br />There is much descriptive detail and a feel of history to this book.  We also read about young Mira's feelings of living in two different worlds. We feel her discomfort at being different, and applaud the philosophy of her parents' marriage which they saw as way to bring peace and understanding into the world.<br />I found the book interesting but not without flaws.  For example, the title implies that we would learn a lot about the geometric tattoos that Motiba had on her face.  The author does mention them but never did find out exactly what they meant.  Also, there were whole sections about Ms. Kamdar's own life that never were explored.  We learn she has two children but she doesn't mention her own husband or marriage.<br />There were nice photographs.  I savored them all.  Some of them were a little small, but I did enjoy them.  Also, the narrative structure, without one line of dialogue, was a little tiring for my eyes even though the book was only 275 pages long.<br />Changes are occurring so rapidly now that it is hard to stop the thrust of globalization that we live with every day.

And this novel, set in turn-of-the century Shanghai, London and Nice where colonial and Chinese culture come together. is no exception. The central character is May-li, who suffered the anguish of having her feet bound as a child. Married at 15 to a brutal sadist, she runs away and become a prostitute in Shanghai. She later marries Arthur Cohen, a gentle philanthropist who brings her into the opulent household of his sister, her wealthy husband and their two young daughters. Her niece Alice becomes especially important to her and their relationship is one of the themes of the book.<br />The story is sad, erotic and macabre. There is cruelty and passion, and a cast of fully developed characters who each have some sort of mental or physical disfigurement. Everyone suffers in this book and it's hard to read, but also hard to put down.<br />One weak point is the many the dream sequences which tend to stop the narrative. Another is the rather unsettling way it jumps back and forth in time. Also, the author has chosen to make the family Jewish, but yet the only thing Jewish about them seem to be their name.<br />Ms. Harrison is a writer with a fine talent and who is not afraid to probe deeply into the hidden abscesses of human behavior by using startling details to depict her twisted characters. It comes across as both disturbing and enlightening. I applaud her willingness to deal with the forbidden.<br />I recently enjoyed her 1995 novel, Poison, which was better paced and richer in texture. The Binding Chair, however, was perhaps written too quickly. This happens sometimes with popular writers who are on a deadline. Therefore, although I enjoyed reading it, I cannot give it an across-the-board recommendation although I do intend to read whatever she writes next.	2000-10-19

Written in 1998, Alaska is true to James Michener's mode of sweeping epic, historical facts and memorable characters.  I personally love books about Alaska and because of its length, I purposely took my time reading it, looking forward each evening to opening the pages and losing myself once more in this special world.<br />This is the story of Alaska in all its glory.  From the anthropological details of early animals and human beings, right up to the late 1980s, the main focus is on the last few hundred years.  There are the early explorers who were awed by its majesty.  There were the first Russian settlements with strong and courageous people.  There was the gold rush.  And the beginnings of the salmon industry.  The horrors of colonialism.  The lawlessness.  The quest for statehood.  And the politics.<br />Most of all though, it is the story of a place.  And because the timeline of the book spans hundreds of years, the characters are interesting but somewhat one-dimensional.  We follow their family lines, but they come and go, leaving legacies for future generations but never really being developed to their fullest.<br />I loved the book for what it was though, a background to all the other books I've been reading about Alaska lately.  Thankfully, the author informed the reader in a chapter by chapter prologue exactly what was based on fact and what was truly fiction.  Yes, someone did once ride a bike from Dawson to Nome in the dead of winter.  And yes, some of the deeds of the early sea captains were taken from actual records.<br />Again, because the book covers many centuries, there is a limit to how deeply he could go into a theme.  For example, I would have liked more about the different native peoples.  It's impossible to do it all.  But James Michener sure did try.<br />I do feel that this book is a worthy read and I do recommend it.  Give yourself time though to let yourself be swept into this wonderful story of Alaska. There's certainly a lot to learn.	2000-10-17

I identified completely with<br />each of these women, whose story takes the reader from their childhood<br />in the late 1930s and includes the voice of the one surviving sister<br />who lives to tell the story.<br />Throughout, there is the haunting<br />presence of Trujillo.  As young girls, they see him select an older<br />classmate to be one of his many mistresses. They hear stories of how<br />he has murdered all the men in some families.  They see how their<br />father and the people around them are forced to bend to the dictator's<br />iron will.<br />The reader gets to know each one of the sisters.  We<br />share their romances and their hopes and dreams.  We see their thirst<br />for education and the cold hand of repression. We watch the girls fall<br />in love, marry, have babies, and slowly but surely get involved in<br />politics. We're right there with them in prison.  And we see their<br />courage and compassion and terrors.<br />I identified with each one of<br />the sisters, and loved the way the author used seemingly simple<br />details in beautiful language to constantly reinforce their humanity.<br />The focus is on the women and their extraordinary strength.  The male<br />characters are handled with less depth and their weaknesses brought to<br />light. But yet we also see how their culture shapes them all.<br />As the<br />ending is an already-known fact in history, the tension was in the<br />knowing the inevitable and not being able to stop it.  For this reason<br />I tried to read the book slowly, but as it moved along I was hurtled<br />through the story in much the same way the characters were hurtled<br />through their lives.<br />It is on the pages of this book that I<br />encountered some unforgettable characters.  And learned some history<br />that I had been only vaguely aware of before.  I therefore give this<br />book one of my highest recommendations.I encountered some unforgettable characters.

Some of the information came from Dominick Montiglio, a witness who testified against the mob.  However, much of it is written from his point of view and somehow managed to deny his direct involvement with any of the murders, therefore making me wonder about every aspect of book's accuracy. It details his heroism in Vietnam, his marriage and family life, and includes photos of him as a two-year old at his birthday party as well as his 1965 high school graduation.<br />There are no photos of course of the shocking and brutal murders which are described in gruesome detail throughout the book.  The realism was what was so horrible, and opened my eyes to something that was going on right in my city which I was totally unaware of.  I still shudder when I think of it.<br />For the time I was reading the book, it was like a bright floodlight was shed on a part of New York City history which illuminated the criminal mob underbelly of the times.  Its clear writing style pulled no punches.  The book was meant to shock and it delivered on this promise and is certainly not for everybody.  But for all those willing to explore this world from the safety your armchair, I certainly recommend it.	2000-09-26

The language is harsh and yet lyrical.  The situations are brutal and yet humorous.  There's alcoholism, psychosis, passion and raw exposed emotions.  But in spite of all that, the love and caring shine through.  And the disturbing experiences are told in such an engaging way that instead of feeling sorry for the little girl, I could laugh out loud and admire her pluck and courage.  This book is a testament to love and the resiliency of the human spirit.  I recommend it to all.	2000-09-21

Morris Park	Books	4	16	17	N	N	Looking back on the rude stream of life	In 1934, the 28-year old Henry Roth published &quot;Call It Sleep&quot; which became a classic novel reflecting the lives of Jewish immigrants on  the lower east side in the early part of the twentieth century.<br />Almost  sixty years later, in 1993, the elderly Roth published Volume I of his  second novel, &quot;Mercy of a Rude Stream&quot; which was intended to be  the first of a 6-volume set.  He has titled this volume, &quot;A Star  Shines Over Mt. Morris Park&quot; and tells the story of Ira Stigman, a  Jewish child growing up in Harlem from  1914 until 1920.<br />The title comes  from a Shakespearean quotation which sees life as a tumultuous rude stream  and as the novel proceeds, it is obvious that this is the thinking of the  author.  Although Roth insists that this book is not autobiographical, it  is structured in a unique way.  There is an aging author who is looking  back on his childhood and struggling to put all his memories down on his  new computer.  These recollections are a break in the narrative and  remind the reader of the inevitability of aging as he comments on his  current rheumatoid arthritis and his disappointment in one of his sons.  He'll then get back to the basic story of the young Ira Stigman and his  coming of age.<br />The reader can't help identifying with the young  protagonist and seeing the world through his eyes.  We live through the  feelings of alienation and of trying to assimilate.  We understand  the  tears of his grandmother as his uncle goes off to fight in World War I.  We  experience the conflicts between the old Jewish culture and the new  American one.  There is anti-semitism, racism and poverty. There is hope  for the future and a rude sexual awakening.  It's all the stuff that life  is made of.  And we live Ira Stigman's life right along with him.<br />I did  like reading this, but sometimes found myself becoming impatient. Perhaps  its simply because the material itself is nothing fresh for me.  Or perhaps  there is something painful about the contrasting view of the young boy and  the old man writing this book and trying to make peace with his life.<br />I  understand that Mr. Roth managed to publish two more volumes of this  narrative before he died in 1995 at the age of 89.  I don't know whether I  want to read them or not.  I feel very complete in having read this first  volume which is 290 pages long.<br />Recommended for those who are interested  in this particular time in history, the immigrant culture, and Henry Roth  in particular.is something painful about the contrasting view of the young boy and  the old man writing this book and trying to make peace with his life.<br />I  understand that Mr. Roth managed to publish two more volumes of this  narrative before he died in 1995 at the age of 89.

And even though<br />I'm not planning or recreating the dishes, I can almost taste them in<br />my mind by reading this book.<br />The authors, Tsering Wangmo and Zara<br />Houshmand not only bring recipes from The Lhasa Mood Tibetan<br />restaurant in San Francisco on to the printed page. They also give the<br />reader a feeling of the role that food plays in the way of life of the<br />Tibetan people.<br />For example, in the Tibetan diet, butter and is much<br />more than food. It is accepted as currency for trade or taxes, burned<br />for light in butter lamps, smeared on the face as an ointment for<br />protection against wind and cold, and consumed medicinally.  And the<br />salted and buttered tea, known as Poecha, is consumed in large amounts<br />as people sip it all day to keep warm and avoid dehydration in the<br />high altitude.<br />Another interesting insight about Tibetan food is<br />appreciation for the Buddhist belief that all lives are equal, so<br />larger animals are preferred as food.  In his writings, His Holiness<br />the Dalai Lama has expressed his utter dismay at the loss of lives in<br />a whole plateful of shrimp making a meal for a single person.<br />I'm<br />lucky to have several Tibetan restaurants to enjoy in New York City,<br />but if I ever get to San Francisco I would definitely check out the<br />Lhasa Moon.	2000-09-16

Written  with gritty realism, the reader is drawn into the writing teacher's own  graphically erotic sex scenes with a detective, as well as her fear of  being stalked by an the unknown murderer.<br />The plot twists and turns and  seems to be a basic murder mystery.  But then, the book ends suddenly in a  sick and sadistic way.  And the reader is shocked, not only because of the  brutality of this conclusion, but because there was no real foreshadowing  of this kind of development.  I cringed when I read it.  But I can't say it  haunted me because it was just so discordantly out-of-context that I  couldn't identify with it.  For that reason I can't recommend this  book.<br />But even though I still get occasional negative chills recalling  the book, I'm sure I'll want to see the movie.	2000-09-13

Homes when it was first published, but just  thinking about it still gives me the shivers.  It's a scary book, mostly  because it forces the reader's mind to think in a sick and grotesque  way.<br />The narrator is a 54-year old pervert who serving time in Sing Sing  for the rape and murder of a 12-year old girl.  He has served 23 years  already when he receives a letter from a 19-year old girl who is planning  to seduce a 12-year old boy.  A correspondence follows which forces the  pedophile's memory to reveal the most shocking and lurid details of his  crimes.<br />This was easily one of the most disgusting books I ever read.  The act of reading it made me nauseous,  but yet I applaud the author for  her courage to write it and do recommend it to the few brave souls who are  willing to experience its horrific roller coaster ride.<br />But be  forewarned:  the disgust and revulsion last long after the book is  finished, and its essence is impossible to forget.	2000-09-12

The  reader is plunged into 17th century Spain and hurled into the contrasting  lives of Francisca, the daughter of a poor Spanish silk grower, and Marie  Louise de Bourbon, the young and tragic Queen of Spain.<br />The words are  pure poetry and filled with fascinating historical details: silk worms and  exotic poisons, court life and the dungeons of the Inquisition,  wet-nurses  and dwarfs, religion and politics.  It's all there.<br />The world she  describes made me squirm.  Pulled me into the story, and kept me turning  the pages.<br />Against this background, and with exquisite detail, the reader  is thrust into the lives of these two women.  Our hearts race with  forbidden passion and we shudder with fear of the Inquisition carts. We  visit the royal bedchamber as well as the torturer's rack.<br />There's love  in this book, and lots of sadness.  There are lessons to learn and  metaphors for life.  People to care about.  Sin, deception, betrayal. And,  when the book is over, there is the feeling of having lived for a short  while through the terror and turmoil that defined 17th century  Spain.<br />This book is not for the squeamish. Or for those who are looking  for a light pleasant read.  But for those who are willing to experience the  harshness of the world it describes, this is a really fine book.	2000-09-04

He certainly did leave a powerful legacy though.  &quot;The Godfather&quot; and other books about the Mafia will long stand  as classics in their field.<br />I personally enjoy Mafia books and looked  forward to reading this one.  I wasn't disappointed.  It has all the  elements of a good Mafia read:  the rise to power of a young Mafia leader,  violence, romance, intrigue, betrayal, interesting characters and, above  all, a strict observance of the Sicilian code of honor.<br />It's predictable  of course.  There is the good guy, Astorre Violla, trained to follow in his  adoptive father, Don Raymonde Aprile's footsteps.  Astorre is everyman's  ideal of Mafia manhood.  He is attractive and honor bound and, although  there are a few hard choices, every murder he commits is justified.<br />Then  there are all those bad guys.  They have no scruples, and will murder just  for the money or for power.  And there are those weak guys, such as the FBI  agent in this book, who treads a thin line between right and wrong.<br />The  women have always played secondary positions in Mr. Puzo's work, but at  least in this book one of them is a sharp lawyer by profession.  Another  one is a sadistic cop.  And yet another uses her feminine wiles as bait in  the search for justice.<br />The plot moves quickly and there are only 336  pages set in large type.  It's easily a one-sitting book, but I enjoyed it  so much I stopped reading halfway through on purpose because I wanted it to  last.  Basically, its a good story with a good plot.  I just wish that Mr.  Puzo didn't insult the reader's intelligence so much by over-explaining  what was going on.<br />The book could have used a lot more fleshing out too.  Character tags are quick and fast ways to make characters interesting, but  not quite enough to stir emotions.  But we do have to remember that Mr.  Puzo was dying as he wrote this and this was probably the best he could do.  I must say that I applaud him for pursuing his writing up until the very  end of his life.  And I am glad to have read the book.<br />Recommended for  fans, such as myself, of this genre.

However, he, himself,  called this particular book a work of fiction.<br />This is basically a  journey of discovery.  He wanted to learn about the Aboriginal and their  &quot;dreaming tracks&quot;.  As they walk about the land they sing the  names of every plant and rock and these &quot;songlines&quot; are one huge  maze that define their world.<br />He describes the people he meets and his  quest to find out more and more, and the book is full of these  descriptions.  However, it doesn't really have a coherent feel to it,  especially during the last third of the book, where he diverts completely  from the present and inserts pieces from his notebooks that he had been  keeping for many years.<br />Basically, Mr. Chatwin is a philosopher who is  fascinated with the nomadic existence, and the reader is subject to many  anthropological theories about animal and human migration and the nature of  human beings.  While these concepts are interesting, it just couldn't  sustain my interest, and I found much of this part boring.<br />The book did  increase my understanding of the Aboriginal world however, and added  another element to my understanding of Australia.  I yearn to know more.  And that is good.  But it was just too meandering and wordy for me.	2000-08-25

I loved &quot;Confederates in the Attic&quot; and &quot;Baghdad Without a Map&quot;  and looked forward to reading &quot;One for the Road&quot;, his very first  book which describes his adventures hitchhiking across the Australian  outback in 1987 at the age of 27.<br />With only a backpack and a sense of  adventure, he shares his journey with the reader, skillfully describing the  mostly desolate terrain and the people he meets along the way.  His sense  of humor and instinctive quest for the quirky detail made me smile often  and I tried to read this small 206-page book as slowly as possible because  I just wanted it to last.<br />I'm a mature city-dwelling grandmother and it's  unlikely I'll ever stand by  the side of the road with a cardboard sign and  an outstretched thumb (or index finger as they do in Australia) waiting for  a stranger to open a car door and share a little piece of his or her life  with me.  But for the moments that I was engaged in the book, Tony Horwitz  brought me right there.<br />He made me feel the 100-degree-plus heat, the  flies so dense he had to squint his eyes.  My head swirled with the  countless bottles of beer he described drinking as he tried to ignore the  fact that most of the drivers who picked him up were drunk.  He slept in  his clothes by the side of the road, met aboriginals and opal diggers and  got seasick working as a deck hand on a fishing boat.<br />And I also  experienced the wonder of it all, the freedom of waking up in the morning  and not knowing what the day will bring, the time to relish each moment,  and the writer's eye to make the trip real for the many people destined to  read his book.  Occasionally, the book got a bit slow, but that is not a  criticism, but rather just part of the reality of the experience.<br />I  really loved this book.  And wish there were more books out there by this  author.  Hopefully, he'll write another book soon.

Rowling is a good writer.  She has an exceptional imagination and an wonderful skill when it comes to pacing and  plot development.  She creates unusual words and magical concepts and makes  them all seem real.<br />Harry Potter is a young boy who attends the Hogwarts  School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.  This is a  school which exaggerates  all the attributes of what we all remember about our school days.  There's  a difference though.  This school is all about magic.  Just imagine an  invisibility cloak, a device for time travel, a game played on flying  broomsticks, and courses on magical creatures and potions and  divination.<br />Add to this mix Harry's two cohorts, Hermoine and Ron, and a  long list of teachers.  Everyone is either a good guy or a bad guy.  There's action on every page.  Violence or the potential for violence  everywhere.  And a story that keeps pulling you in.<br />This book dealt with  Harry's battle with someone he thinks was responsible for his parents' murder.  That's serious stuff.<br />However, I'm not an eight-year old.  And  my interest in magic and fantasy is limited.  So even though I read this  book with a sense of admiration for the writer and a deep curiosity as to  what would happen next, I can't see myself running out to buy all four  books and raving about them to the world.<br />I recommend this book and, if  J.K. Rowling continues this series, I might just read another one in the  future just to see how Harry is doing as he grows into manhood.  But as for  now.  I've had enough.	2000-08-05

It was a long hard read and impossible to totally grasp it all.  There's just too much  information packed into tight paragraphs and a presupposition that the  reader is familiar with the material.<br />I was determined to read it  however, and absorb as much as I could, and so I just kept reading, letting  my eyes skim over parts I couldn't quite understand.  I pushed on through  with the intention of getting a general understanding even though I knew  I'd never remember all the names of kings, battles, and constantly changing  borders of countries.<br />The author is British and the book a bit  Eurocentric, but he did manage to include the whole globe in a somewhat  confusing way.  Sometimes he'd jump from Europe to Asia to the Middle East  all on one page.  And then from century to century.  It was an ambitious  undertaking. I applaud him for it.

She's also the wife of Tony Horwitz, who wrote &quot;Confederates in the Attic&quot; and &quot;Baghdad Without a Map.&quot; I read both of these books and remember how fondly he speaks of her.  And so reading this book was, in a way, getting to know her too.<br />Ms. Brooks is a secular feminist.  She makes no secret of that.  And, as a woman, she was able to gain entry into a the world behind the heavy veils, which she often needed to wear herself.  She spoke with many woman, did a lot of research, and moved within this special world as an observer and witness to her times.<br />Her interviews ranged from the Queen of Jordan to a Palestinian woman who lived in with her husband, his second wife and all their children in a modest hut.  Some of the women she talked with were highly educated; others had never learned to read and write. They all accepted their religion and were able to express their point of view in a way I could understand even though some of them were often hostile to westerners.<br />Ms. Brooks tried to cover a lot in her book -- the treatment of women in different countries, the practice of genital mutilation, education of women, legal status.  She even discussed the contradictions about the status of women all the way back to Mohammed's time.  That's a big order for a little book.  It was not always successful.  It only opened my mind.  It did not satisfy it, leaving me with a desire to learn more.  And especially wanting to read some works written from an Islamic woman's point of view.<br />Also, since its publication in 1995, much of it is dated.  Her interview with Mrs. Khomeini at the time of the Ayatollah's death took place in 1989.  And, more recently, Jordan's King Hussein and Syria's Hafez Assad have passed away.  But I must say that this book did open my eyes.  It's time now to learn more.	2000-07-08

Hodding Carter, has a dream.  He wants to re-create the voyage of Viking Leif Eriksson who, in the Year 1000, sailed from Greenland to North America in an open Viking Longboat.  Carter has no ship.  He has  no crew.  And he doesn't know much about sailing.  But, after three years  and a whole series of misadventures, he finally does it.  This book is the  result.<br />Somehow, he convinced Land's End to sponsor the journey, but he  still had to get the boat constructed, find a crew and handle the thousands  of details to make it happen.  His first attempt ended in defeat but he  tried again the following year.  He had learned a lot by then and while the  crossing wasn't exactly easy, he and his eight-man crew reached their  goal.<br />Of course Carter's crossing wasn't exactly like the crossing for  the Vikings. The Vikings, of course, didn't know where they were going and  certainly weren't able to have e-mail on board.  And they didn't have the  modern food supplies and ability to cook the gourmet meals that this  modern-day crew enjoyed daily.  But the sea was the same, the frustration  of days without a good wind, the hard physical labor, the beauty of  visiting some remote islands, and the camaraderie among the crew.<br />The  style of writing is light and sometimes comical.  The Viking lore is  interesting and the descriptions of the surrounding sea and the physical  experience of living on an open boat are well done.<br />But I never really  got the differences between the eight crew members.  This should have been  an automatic reflex by the end of the book.  But even though the author  tried his best, and even had some photos of the men, with the exception of  Rob, the eccentric boat builder, they all had a certain sameness to  me.<br />Also, this trip was never life threatening.  I didn't bite my  fingernails with worry about them.  When in trouble, the Coast Guard was  there.<br />Basically the book is a pleasant read about an interesting  experience.  And I did learn a bit about sailing and the experience of  living in an open boat.  Too bad Leif Eriksson never wrote a book.  THAT  would have been quite a story.  Lacking that, however, I guess we just have  to settle for W. Hodding Carter.experience.  And I did learn a bit about sailing and the experience of  living in an open boat.

Set in a southern mountain town,  Margaret is the pastor of the church and her husband, Adrian runs an  experimental school for troubled young people.  The tension is created when  Grace, a charismatic fundamentalist who has received a &quot;calling&quot;  wants to create a march for Jesus, an elderly man in monk's clothing comes  to town for his own private reasons, and a troubled teenager disrupts their  routines.<br />There's a richness to Ms. Godwin's writing.  It's all in the  expert layering of details which bring out the story on many levels,  including faith in God and the Christian tradition.  I was fascinated by it  all, loved the characters, and enjoyed curling up with the people and  places in this special landscape. There's a mastery in the author's use of  subtleties  and I found myself constantly pondering some of the ideas it  raised.<br />Perhaps there was a little too much of constant exploration about  questions of faith but I accepted it as part of the writing style and in  keeping with the theme.  The pace is leisurely and that is why I think the  ending was a little too abrupt. Another fifty pages or so would have been  more in keeping with its style.  However, I did enjoy the book and  recommend it as a really good read.	2000-06-29

His co-author, Patrick Picciarelli, is a good writer and he makes Jimmy's story read like a well paced novel.<br />Jimmy's full of swagger, wisecracks, and macho boastfulness and at first he annoyed me with his know-it-all attitude and narrow focus.  Jimmy's always justifying his actions.  And when he later ponders moral questions letting big bucks cloud his judgement as he starts to work for the mob, he does it in a cock-sure way that makes even his weaknesses seem a way of boasting.<br />But although I often felt angry with Jimmy, the talent of the writer let his humanity come though.  Underneath his swagger, there's a little kid who's wanting adventure and wanting to look important in the eyes of his buddies.<br />It's a good, small book and I enjoyed reading it.  It might have annoyed me at times, but it also made me laugh out loud. Probably some of the stories were exaggerated, but there's enough here that rings true to give the reader a picture of a gritty way of life that's lived on the edge.  This is not fiction.  And there are no heroic acts.  Just a story of one man and the world he lives in.<br />I might not like Jimmy very much, but I did like the book.  Once started, I couldn't put it down.	2000-06-27

Subtitled &quot;a novel of foot binding&quot;,  this book was first published in China in 1986 by the enormously popular Chinese writer, Feng Jicai and translated into English in 1994.<br />Told as a &quot;once upon a  time&quot; story, the writer skillfully combines myth, reason and a  compelling tale while bringing the reader into the world of the  &quot;three-inch golden lotus&quot;, the tiny bound feet of Chinese  women.<br />Everything I have ever wondered about this fascinating custom is  right here in this book.  From the agonies inflicted upon young girls whose  childhood includes broken bones and searing pain to the high esteem these  tiny feet bring them as adults, it's all here, including the group of men  who erotically adore them.<br />Set in the early part of the 20th century,  Fragrant Lotus has her feet bound by her grandmother as an act of love and  tradition.  Later, her small feet catch the eyes of a wealthy man who makes  her the bride of his oldest son.  The women of the family all compete in  family &quot;foot contests&quot; at which &quot;lotus loving&quot; friends  of her father-in-law spend hours debating the fine points of the history of  foot binding and its many nuances.<br />Through the years, Fragrant Lotus  becomes the head of the family and comes face to face with the changing  movement to outlaw foot binding.<br />At only 229 pages, this book is a great  read on many levels.  The writer really captures the world he has set out  to describe, does a excellent job of characterization and keeps the tension  high with his minute descriptions of the foot contests. He also has a way  of making this all into a satirical tall tale as the concepts of truth and  reality are constantly explored. Deceptively simple, this story has a far  deeper meaning as a metaphor for the cultural revolution as standards of  beauty change.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-06-19
2420982:US	52294653	RVOH34ZTSTY93	0375753389	781694995	Terra Incognita: Travels in Antarctica	Books	5	32	35	N	N	A modern female perspective of the frozen south	Sometimes I think I must have been an Eskimo in a prior life, because I love books about the frozen north.  When I came upon this book, subtitled &quot;Travels in Antarctica&quot;, by Sara Wheeler, my imagination was  immediately captured as I realized this was a whole new territory for me to  explore in my reading experience.<br />Ms. Wheeler is a young British travel  writer who spent 7 months in Antarctica in 1995 as a writer-in-residence  with the U.S. National Science Foundation.  What a great gig!<br />A lot of  research went into the writing of this book.  And a lot of love. She mixes  all the historical details of the early explorations of Shackleton,  Amundson and Scott with her own modern and female perspective of the places  she goes, the people she meets and the emotional effect all this has on her  as she explores the coldest, windiest and driest continent in the  world.<br />As Antarctic explorations go, hers has a certain degree of  comfort.  She is helicoptered around to various bases, and even though  there are periods of time that she spends in a tent or igloo or prefab  shelter, she has radio contact with the base and always has a supply of  food.  But this, of course, is what it is like to travel to Antarctica  these days, and she is fortunate indeed to have the experience of going  there.  This is not a tourist destination after all.  And virtually  everybody there is a scientist of some sort.<br />She describes her  experiences well and I loved he sense of humor, especially when describing  the differences between the bases manned by different nationalities.  The  Italians have the best food.  The Brits are completely male, bonded in  their background of English private schools and given to bawdy toilet humor  and practical jokes.  And the American staff is approximately 25%  female.<br />The book was a slow read, especially the parts which go into  detail about the fascinating history, but I didn't mind.  Also, the pace of  the book tended to remain the same throughout as she traveled from base to  base making her observations.  The bases might have been isolated, but even  in 1995, she was able to get e-mail there.<br />The concluding chapters were  the most interesting.  Perhaps it is because by then the reader has  absorbed all the history and first impressions.  During these last  chapters, Ms. Wheeler spends several months with an American woman  artist  in a prefabricated cabin out on the ice.  The artist paints. The writer  writes.  They develop a deep friendship as they prepare meals and grapple  with the environment amidst the startling beauty of their surroundings,  watching the long polar nights welcome the sun.<br />I was sorry to see the  book end because during the time I was reading it, I was transported to a  very real part of the world that I will probably never have the opportunity  to visit myself.  So for all my fellow armchair travelers, I definitely  recommend this book.remain the same throughout as she traveled from base to  base making her observations.

The words touched an nerve.  I have never seen such a  succinct description of Manhattan as in this British guidebook written by  Fiona Duncan and Leonie Glass.<br />I don't read New York City guidebooks.  After all, I'm a New Yorker.  I know all the places to go.  I LIVE HERE.  But a few weeks ago, when visiting my friend who runs a Bed and Breakfast,  I picked up this little gem of a book.<br />Here it is.  Neighborhood by  neighborhood.  Street by street.  With the best architectural maps I have  ever seen.  All the basic New York City highlights are here too.  But most  of all, it really gets the flavor of this city that I love.  And that's a  big compliment.<br />Published in 1992, by Passport Books, it is of course a  bit outdated.  And there is no one book that can do it ALL, especially in a  mere 144 pages.  But for tourists and New Yorkers alike, this book is a  treat.	2000-06-03

Thompson's book, &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, a  diary of Noel Coward's Las Vegas gig and a 1952 article from the New Yorker  about atomic bomb testing when rooftop parties welcomed the flashes of  light in the desert.  There's a piece by John Gregory Dunne about the life  of an obscure comedian, a piece by Joan Didion about the marriage chapel  industry and lots of well written and interesting pieces about gambling and  the changes that have occurred in Las Vegas right up to 1993.<br />My  favorites pieces by far though were the personal recollections of two women  who grew up there, both from very different backgrounds.<br />Susan Berman,  growing up in the 1950s,  is the daughter of the mobster Dave Berman.  She  describes how her father taught her math by giving her a slot machine to  play with and the Sabbath meals that her grandmother used to prepare for  her father's Jewish gangster friends.<br />Phyllis Barber also grew up during  the same period of time and recalls how her family woke early one morning  to drive out to see the atomic blasts and be part of history.  Church-going  religious Mormons, her mother disapproves when she joins the precision  marching dance team at Las Vegas High School. Later she has to make a  difficult choice between representing a casino in a parade and attending  church on a Sunday afternoon.<br />I wished that some of these pieces could be  longer.  I would have liked to have delved deeper into some of the  articles, especially these personal recollection pieces.  But the tone of  the book is a lot like Las Vegas itself.  The lights keep flashing, the  cards keep being dealt and the roulette wheel keeps spinning.  All the  reader can do sit back and enjoy!	2000-06-03

This is more than just  the story of Hawaii, however.  It is the story of a native Hawaiian jazz  musician, Keo, who travels to New Orleans, Paris and then Shanghai, and  finds himself in a brutal Japanese prison during the war.  It is also the  story of Sunny, his Korean-Hawaiian girlfriend, who finds herself a  Japanese &quot;comfort woman&quot;.<br />The author doesn't spare the reader  the horrors of the war.  Her searing words shed light on this dark time in  history with an intensity that made me shudder with its graphic violence  and unremitting horrors.  Over and over the reader experiences the  starvation, disease, pain and physical and mental deterioration of people  who are forced to live in unspeakable conditions where human endurance  under such circumstances is tested to the limit.<br />Woven throughout the  plot is the story of their families, life in Hawaii, and the spirituality  of the Hawaiian people.  The reader also feels the cadence of Hawaii and  the magic in her words as she describes Keo's music.<br />I would have liked  this book to be lighter.  I would have liked to smile rather than cringe at  the unrelenting horror.  I would have liked a happier ending.  But that is  not the story that the author wanted to tell.  And so I accept it on its  own terms.  And, if nothing else, it makes me appreciate the good life I  have.<br />I recommend this book but be forewarned.  It will haunt your dreams  and inspire nightmares.	2000-05-23

When denied a larger apartment for his small family, he creates a political  cartoon blaming his bosses for corruption.  This begins of series of  increasingly provocative attacks and counterattacks as the humble man  outwits his superiors over and over again.<br />The author, Ha Jin, came to  the United States at the age of 29 in 1985, having spent six years serving  in the People's Liberation Army.  His descriptions of daily life and  typical frustrations are refreshing.  This is not a book about prison camps  or starvation.  This is not a book about the tyranny of communism or of  escape to freedom.  This is simply a book about a man who wants a larger  apartment.<br />Anyone who has ever felt frustration by being a little fish in  a big pond can identify with Shao Bin who, in spite of setback after  setback just keeps on going. There is satire in this book, and very funny  slapstick comedy, and I felt myself laughing out loud at times.<br />Do not  miss this delightful gem of a book.	2000-05-20

He's been a journalist for British publications and has written  several travel memoirs. Now it was time to experience a part of the America  he left behind by hiking this famous trail.<br />The Appalachian Trail  consists of 2,100 rugged miles along the east coast and passes through 14  states from Georgia to Maine, built with the labor from public works in the  1930s.  It has been re-routed slightly over the years and has never  achieved the ideal which included many comfortable rest areas.  Environmental disasters have taken its toil as well as the blunders and  shortsightedness of governmental organizations.  But it still exists as a  challenge for hikers who often hike just a part of the trail.<br />With a  companion from his college days, the overweight and sometimes blundering  Stephen Katz from Des Moines, Bryson starts out in Georgia with the plan of  completing the entire trail.  They know this is a challenge for them.  Both  of them are novices, and with a sense of depreciating humor, he shares his  personal point of view with the reader -- his apprehensions, his fatigue,  the people he meets, the places he visits and his companionship with his  friend.<br />Not is all deep woods, however, and their infrequent sojourns to  towns where they can occasionally go to a restaurant and sleep in a motel  are welcome relief before they pick up their packs again and once more walk  all day and sleep in their tents at night.  And then there is the part of  the trail where they must sleep in rat-infested shelters with other hikers  and well as  weather conditions that include a roaring blizzard and icy  conditions.<br />My son-in-law has hiked part of the Appalachian trail and  gave me this book. It gave me insight into some of the experiences he must  have had.  And it also made me yearn for an outdoor adventure myself.<br />But  whether you are a skilled outdoors person, or an armchair traveler like me,  this book is a wonderful read.periences he must  have had.

He has written 44 books on Japan in both English and Japanese and now makes his home in Texas. This book is a  compilation of an eclectic array of vignettes.<br />The title gives it away.  &quot;Strange But True&quot; lives up to it's expectations. The point of  view of all of these stories is targeted so that an American audience can  click its lips in wonder at the weirdness of these people.<br />Many of the  stories are retelling of historical battles, including the rite of hari  kari.  Other stories give unique glimpses of history, such as the story of  the geisha who married into the J.P. Morgan family or the Russian duke who  was wounded while visiting Japan.  There's a long confusing story about the  trial of Tokyo Rose who did radio broadcasts to American armed forces in  the Pacific during W.W.II and a story about an American who became a  Japanese citizen.<br />Another piece focuses on the odd way that Japanese is  sometimes translated into English, making fun of some of their attempts.  Of course he barely mentions how the Japanese might view some  English-speaking people's attempts to speak Japanese<br />For someone who has  lived for many years in Japan and written so extensively Mr. Seward doesn't  like sushi and describes Japanese food in a way that makes it seem rather  disgusting.  It's a good thing I know better.<br />His tales all focus on  their strangeness and even though a few of the historical details were  interesting, Mr. Seward has a rather parochial and one-sided point of view  of the Japanese.  There's a sense of mockery and ethnocentrism throughout  as he seems to raise an eyebrow over and over again at traditional Japanese  ways.<br />What I, as a reader, find &quot;strange but true&quot; is the fact  that Mr. Seward could have lived so many years in Japan, written so many  books about the language and the culture, and stills sees the Japanese  through a prism of cultural barriers and prejudice.<br />Definitely NOT  RECOMMENDED.sees the Japanese  through a prism of cultural barriers and prejudice.<br />Definitely NOT  RECOMMENDED.	2000-05-11

The central character is the matriarch Pono, whose life includes harsh realities and surreal myths.  Her  long and passionate love for her husband Duke has caused her great joy, but  the situations they had to face together have required strength and  courage.<br />Pono's four adult granddaughters, each born of a different mixed  blood heritage and who now live in various parts of the world, come back to  Hawaii to visit, forcing them all to come to terms backgrounds.<br />Their  stories are all revealed though flashbacks, going all the way back through  seven generations, mixing history with myth in a wonderful array of  unforgettable characters.  I'll never forget the story of life in a leper  colony, or of life on a plantation.  I'll long remember the mythical  quality of the sea and its ability to both nourish and destroy.  There's  life and death and passion and joy.  There's war and peace and destruction  by both human greed and natural forces.<br />At 480 pages, this is a book to  sink into and look forward to reading at the end of the day.  A book that  brings the story of Hawaii alive to the reader and a fresh retelling of  truths and legends	2000-05-05

Moral and legal ambiguities.  A deeply engrossing story.  Great characterization.<br />Sound familiar?<br />Yes.  This is familiar territory for Chris Bohjalian, author of the best-selling &quot;Midwives&quot;.  And  again, he does a great job.<br />I love the way he structures his books.  The  reader generally knows what is going to happen, but just doesn't know  exactly how. And that is what the fascination is.  That is what kept me  reading, following the protagonist's thoughts and actions and totally  getting into his skin.<br />The story is told in the first person by Leland  Fowler, an 35-year old attorney in the Vermont State prosecutor's office.  Just two years before, his wife died in a tragic car accident, leaving him  to raise his young daughter, now aged 4.  He's grieved for his wife for a  long time, and his life lacks much pleasure.<br />When he develops a sore  throat and cold that just doesn't go away he visits the local homeopath,  Carissa Lake.  There is an immediate attraction.  His cold gets cured and a  romance develops.<br />However, when one of Carissa's clients falls into a  coma, there are legal and moral issues that come into play.  The situation  becomes more and more complex as Leland makes some ethnical choices that  force him into a trap of his own making.<br />The title, &quot;The Law of  Similars&quot; refers to a basic tenet of homeopathy whereby the patient is  treated with an extremely diluted dose of something that has caused his  problem, forcing the body to cure itself.  For example, a person with  poison ivy might take a weakened solution of an herb that is similar to  poison ivy.<br />It is all fascinating reading -- the homeopathy, the  legalities, and the ethical questions.  But most of all, it is the  characterization of Leland Fowler that is most outstanding.  Basically, he  is a flawed and imperfect human being who sometimes makes poor choices.  This is something that we all can relate to.<br />The other characters are  never quite as fully developed, but it doesn't matter.  This is Leland  Fowler's story all the way.<br />The success of &quot;Midwives&quot; makes  this book a rough act to follow, and at first I was disappointed because  the author used the same landscape.  It is also only 320 pages long and I  missed the length and complexities that a few more characters might have  brought.  But I just couldn't stop reading.<br />I recommend this book even  though it misses getting my highest rating. There is no doubt in my mind  though, that I will be on the lookout for Mr. Bohjalian's next book.something that we all can relate to.<br />The other characters are  never quite as fully developed, but it doesn't matter.

However, he was a pilot<br />who lived Alaska and had worked as a volunteer in previous races.  He<br />knew many people who had run the race before him and they all<br />encouraged him to do it.<br />Every March, since 1967, between 50 and 80<br />dog sled teams set out on the trail, which can take up to three weeks<br />to complete.  Most are not competing for the front-runner prize.<br />Merely finishing the race is a personal goal for many.  The trek is<br />difficult, requiring stamina, endurance and the ability to make quick<br />decisions in constantly changing conditions.<br />The temperature can<br />vary from 40 degrees above to 65 degrees below zero and there are<br />storms and flooding, drifting snow and heavy winds.  In some places<br />the trail plunges down 200 feet or more, twisting between trees and at<br />the edges of steep drops.  At other places, there are long empty<br />stretches over slick icy rivers.  The sled often spills, the dogs get<br />tangled and sometimes they find themselves miles and miles off the<br />regular trail.<br />Mostly, they prefer to travel at night when the<br />weather is cooler and the dogs are more comfortable.  The musher wears<br />a single beam headlight if the night is dark.  Other times the moon<br />and stars reflect off the snow.  And, on rare occasions there is a<br />spectacular display of flashes and colors in the northern sky.<br />The<br />mushers stop at about 20 checkpoints over the course of their<br />travels. These are mandatory rest stops which often are no more than a<br />tent or a cabin with a place to put a sleeping bag.  A few of the<br />checkpoints are towns with a place to purchase a meal.  Mostly though,<br />the musher must rely on the 50 or more large bags of supplies weighing<br />2000 pounds or more which he or she personally packed and had shipped<br />to these checkpoints. This includes huge amounts of food for the 16<br />hungry dogs who must be tended to and rested at each of these<br />stops.<br />The Iditarod Trail was actually used as a mail route during<br />the boom time of Alaska's gold rush.  And the dog teams of that day<br />did not have the advantages of modern technology.  There were no<br />helicopters charting their progress.  Or airplanes to fly their food<br />to various checkpoints.  There was little if any shelter.  And the<br />conditions for the dogs were certainly not humane.<br />I can't help<br />thinking of Jack London's &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; and<br />&quot;White Fang&quot; which depicted the life of a sled dog at the<br />turn of the century.  In those days dogs were whipped, beaten with<br />clubs, and often starved as the food they were given had to be hunted<br />for as the mushers went along the trail.  They lived and died in their<br />harnesses and it was a constant fight for survival.<br />Modern dogs are<br />never beaten.  The dogs are trained to respond to simple verbal<br />commands and whips are never used.  They are well fed and rested and<br />checked by a vet at every checkpoint. If they are injured they are<br />flown by helicopter to a place they can be cared for.  A musher might<br />start out with 16 dogs, but is allowed to finish with as little as 7<br />if necessary.<br />I enjoyed the book tremendously, even though Don<br />Bowers is no Jack London. This is his first book and he is not a<br />professional writer.  He's good at descriptions of trail conditions<br />and details of the race.  He's also good at discussing his own<br />personal challenges.  I really did empathize with him when a virus<br />killed some of his dog pups.  And I held my breath during his most<br />scary outdoor challengers.  I also have a lot of admiration for his<br />adaptability and sheer determination to finish, no matter what.<br />By<br />the end of the book I had really accepted his style of writing, which<br />is probably like his personality, which tends to be introspective. And<br />sometimes I felt he went on a little too long about some detail.  I<br />must say also that I yearned for deeper characterization of the people<br />around him.  There was a woman named Lisa and a man named Andy who<br />were also &quot;back-of-the-packers&quot;.  They met at checkpoints<br />and helped each other during the long trail.  I wanted to know more<br />about them and wish he would have included a few personal details and<br />a little characterization.<br />I did get to know his dogs though.  Each<br />one was a distinct and interesting personality.  I'll never forget<br />&quot;Socks&quot; one of the leaders, who was able to sense the trail<br />without any markers.  Or the time the team refused to move because the<br />females were in heat.  His love for his dogs really came through.<br />I<br />thank Mr. Bowers for writing the book and definitely recommend it.  It<br />took me to Alaska, put me right on the sled and made me feel I was<br />part of it all.  Quite a departure for a woman who lives in New York<br />City.

As a baby, her family immigrated to the United  States where she was raised in Virginia where her father had a grocery  store.  Her life was harsh and when she married a black man in 1942, her  family disowned her.<br />She raised 12 children, every one of them college  educated, her indomitable spirit strong through poverty and the tragic  deaths of two husbands.  Her color confused her children who lived in a  black world and it wasn't until they had grown to adulthood that her true  story came out.<br />James McBride is a good writer, and his lively clear  prose reflect a home that might have been lacking in material things, but  was extraordinary in its warmth and love and nurturing atmosphere.<br />Ruth  McBride Jordan's story is told in her voice through alternating chapters  and her strength comes through in her words.  Never once is there a shred  of self pity as she tells her story.  When she was first married she and  her husband lived in a cockroach infested single room in Harlem with the  bathroom in the hall.  Her first four children were born while they were  living in that single room.  &quot;It was one of the happiest times of my  life,&quot; she says.  Later they moved to an apartment with their own  private bathroom which was quite a luxury.<br />The reader feels the emotions  that James feels as he struggles with his own identity.  He is the 8th of  the 12 children and watches his older brothers and sisters being influenced  by the &quot;black power&quot; movement of the 70s. Often, he's embarrassed  by the color of his mother's skin.<br />Ruth is an active Christian avid  churchgoer.  James knows little or nothing of Jews.  It is fascinating to  read his point of view which is told with insight and honesty.  And it is  perhaps even more fascinating to hear the words of Ruth.<br />The book is an  inspiration, a testament to love, and social exploration through the eyes  of a mixed race family.  Read it!  You'll love it!esty.

The book is written as a diary, with bizarre  capitalizations and crude drawings.  She uses simple prose as the serial  killer's dark obsession and demented scheming becomes clear and the reader  is drawn into the workings of his mind.  It is horrifying.  The tension  never lets up as one victim after another falls victim to his needs.  The  worst part is that we have all read the papers and know that there are  really sickos like this out there in the world.	2000-04-16

Both of them are based on London's experience in the Yukon, and both are written from the point of view of  dogs.<br />In &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, the dog Buck is kidnapped from  an easy life and sold to a sled team during the Klondike Gold Rush.  In  spite of the numerous cruelties inflicted on him, Buck learns to survive.  Eventually, he returns to the wild and to run with the wolves.<br />In  &quot;White Fang&quot;, the story is reversed.  White Fang is  three-quarters wolf and was born in the wild.  Through a series of events,  he is domesticated and eventually becomes a tame and loving pet.<br />There is  much to learn in both of these stories.  One thing is the way of animals  and their life in the wild.  Another is of the way of life in the Yukon.  And of the men, both brutal and kind, who rely on the dogs to pull the  sleds.<br />Jack London used his words well.  There's an elegant cadence and a  vigorous spirit.  His love for the animals comes through as well as his  respect for the wild forces of nature.  And the theme that life changes are  really possible because of environmental forces.<br />London didn't set out to  write a story about the glorification of nature or vanishing wildlife.  Indeed, during his short lifetime (1876-1916) the way of the wild was a  fact of life.  London just simply wrote his stories. And through his words,  left a legacy of work that will continue to enrich the lives of readers for  many generations to come.	2000-04-05

In 1994 he spent three years as a correspondent for<br />the Agence France-Presse and this book, published in 1998, is a well<br />researched account of a the creeping capitalism, corrupt government,<br />and historical struggles of the Vietnamese people.<br />More than half of<br />Vietnam's population today were born after the war and are more<br />interested in consumerism than communism.  But in spite of their<br />smuggled videos and make-believe motor bikes (which are all chrome and<br />glitz and have tiny motors), they live in a culture where corruption<br />is a way of life, the judicial system is almost non-existent, and<br />writers are persecuted and forbidden to portray Vietnam without a rosy<br />myth.<br />The extent of the corruption is everywhere.  If you are sick<br />you have to pay extra to get the most basic medical care, even if you<br />have government insurance.  If you want your children to pass their<br />exams, you have to pay teachers for &quot;private tuition&quot;.  If<br />you want to move, change jobs or leave the country, you have to pay<br />someone.  The police can arbitrarily rob street vendors or require<br />payoffs from anyone at whim.  And, as foreign investors have found,<br />unlike other Asian countries, the pay-offs do not necessarily obtain<br />the results desired.<br />There's a history of famine in Vietnam and<br />memories of starvation. There are also food practices that Westerners<br />find abhorrent.  Yes.  The Vietnamese do eat dogs and cats and<br />restaurants get big bucks for serving meat that is on the endangered<br />species list.  I know that I should try to not be judgmental, but the<br />ancient practice of beating a dog to death over several hours in order<br />to tenderize the meat particularly disturbs me.<br />The book is dense<br />with facts and slow reading.  And some of the sections were difficult<br />to follow, especially when the author went into great detail about the<br />complexities of corruption in the Vietnamese Communist party where one<br />leader after another would fall into disfavor with the party, be<br />thrown into prison, his family denied any employment and his children<br />forbidden to attend school.<br />To raise money from tourists, especially<br />from Americans who return to Vietnam with a sense of guilt about the<br />war, several war museums have been erected.  The fact that many of the<br />exhibits are not authentic does not stop people from visiting them.<br />There is even a museum that re-creates the infamous tunnels used by<br />the Viet Cong although they had to be made larger to accommodate the<br />larger size American tourists.  There is even a make-believe mine<br />field with firecrackers that explode when a wire is tripped.<br />For the<br />Vietnamese who now live in other parts of the world, returning is<br />difficult.  They are considered rich foreigners and intruders and it<br />is extremely rare for any of them to come back to settle<br />permanently.<br />It was a bit of a struggle for me to read this book.  I<br />learned a lot but cannot say I enjoyed it.  There was very little to<br />break the tension and the few shreds of humor were few and far<br />between.  And yet, for anyone who is truly interested in a serious<br />comprehensive analysis of what Vietnam is today, this is a worthwhile<br />book and I would definitely recommend it.eader after another would fall into disfavor with the party, be thrown into prison, his family denied any employment and his children forbidden to attend school.<br />To raise money from tourists, especially from Americans who return to Vietnam with a sense of guilt about the war, several war museums have been erected.

Books	4	9	10	N	N	A cast of supporting characters tell the story	The book is arranged in 16 chapters, each one told from the point of view of another character.  Yolanda &quot;Yo&quot; Garcia, from the Dominican Republic, is central to each of these chapters, but always through the eyes  of someone else.<br />There's the story of the maid in the Garcia household,  Yo's professor at college who urges her get a doctorate, Yo's best woman  friend who attends a therapy group with her, her landlady who is abused by  her husband and a student whose story she plagiarizes.  I felt the best  chapters were the ones set in the Dominican Republic, where Yo returns each  summer to write.  There's the old woman who asks Yo to write a letter for  her, there are the caretakers on the estate, there's the night watchman who  can't read or write, and there's a chapter where one of Yo's suitors joins  her in the family compound during the time that Yo's uncle is running for  president of the country.<br />The book is the strongest when it contrasts the  servant class with the privileged class.  However,  all the supporting  characters are much better developed than the central character, Yo.  Also,  there weren't any real facts about the Dominican Republic so that I could  see the story in context of history.  And Yo herself never really emerged  with the deep characterization the author intended.  I wasn't drawn into  her personality or her complexities.  The book was fast pleasant reading,  but I yearned for more depth.	2000-03-25

When the crabs were running there was almost no sleep, backbreaking labor,  and constant danger in sub-zero temperatures and storms at sea.<br />Rewards  for the hearty were steep, however.  Crewman had shares in the ship's  profits and, if the crabs were running well, could pull in $40,000 or more  in a single 29-day stint at sea.  No wonder Alaska was attracting all these  young men and a few courageous women.<br />There's hardships and joy, elation  and despair, physical feats of survival and courage more exciting than any  fiction.  The detailed descriptions of the beauty of the land and the  realities of nature pulled me right from my life in New York City and set  me down next to Walker as he worked with fellow crewman pulling 2000 pound  pots of crab from the sea.  I felt the frigid wind, the tossing deck, the  constant icy spray of seawater.  I reeked with seasickness and fatigue and  the camaraderie of the crewmen.  I celebrated my new found riches in the  one bar in town, and mourned the tragic deaths from the whims of  nature.<br />This is also the story of the fishing industry itself.  It's the  story of greed.  And massive investments in technology which plundered the  seas of their resources.  Its the story of boom and bust and human  endurance.  And it will forever add a new dimension to my perception of the  world.	2000-03-18

Minor was an American, a doctor during the Civil War. He was delusional after the war and, on a trip to England, during one of his paranoid fits, he murdered an innocent man.  When apprehended, it was  obvious that Dr. Minor was insane and so confined to the Broadmoor Criminal  Lunatic Asylum.<br />During Dr. Minor's lifetime, he contributed more than  10,000 well-researched entries to the OED.  Madness obviously had nothing  to do with his intelligence.<br />The book is about the relationship between  Professor Murray, who was in charge of the OED and Dr. Minor, but it is  also about a love of language and the mamouth task of producing the OED.  The Professor and the Madman is well written and is a beautiful story,  extremely detailed in its research.  The author has poured though thousands  of files from the various hospitals where Dr. Minor was confined, court  documents, Civil War records and genealogical records of both of these  men's families.<br />What has emerged is a brilliant book, that brings to the  reader a fascinating part of history.  Who would have ever thought that the  creation of a dictionary would be so interesting?  I loved this book.  Loved the way the author weaves the tale and gave historical details to  support his conclusions.  The author is British and his use of words and  point of view really get into the mindset of the men who created the  dictionary and the Victorian setting in which they lived.<br />This book is a  treat.  Don't miss it.<br />As a postscript, I must say that I just heard  that a new edition of the OED has just become available online.	2000-03-16

She has always studied great literature and so it is not accidental that the theme of great literary passions run throughout  this book, contrasting sharply with her own experiences.<br />The book is a  delight to read, full of nostalgic details of the popular culture around  her as she grew up in the forties and fifties.  It's a painfully honest  book as she, with humor and insight, chronicles a lifetime of disappointing  romances with strong commentary on the contemporary state of marriage.  She  comes across as very human and yet imperfect, and her appeal is to everyone  who has ever believed in a fairytale.<br />There were times I was impatient  with her.  She kept waiting for romance to come to her, constantly  searching for the perfect man. She looked at herself and her aspirations  with humor, but never really took any positive actions. In spite of a  career, two children and a marriage, and some tentative experiments with  affairs, it took her until her sixties to seem to find that love.<br />This is  more than a book about one human being however.  It is the story of how the  world we live in holds up an idealized version of romance which is echoed  in great literature.  And how the search for this romance is doomed to  failure.<br />The book is hard to put down.  I looked forward to reading it  and was sorry to see it end.  She's a good writer and I appreciate the way  her words fall across the page, leading me on and letting me share her  life.	2000-03-08

Her voice is fresh and ripe with metaphor as the reader is surrounded by the world of southern India.  Told through the  eyes of Rahel, now grown, who revisits the childhood secret she shares with  her twin brother, it speaks of love, life and a loss of innocence.<br />They  live in Kerula, a Christian matriarchal state, with their divorced mother,  blind grandmother, bitter aunt and sad uncle.  It is a world where  impending communism is supposed to be weakening the caste system which has  been rooted in the culture for thousands of years.  It is a world of decay  and disaster.  There's  a skyblue Plymouth, a graygreen river and a world  of wonder for the two-egg twins whose vision is filtered through their  clear-eyed innocence.<br />The story is one of passion and forbidden love told  with fresh eyes while &quot;night's elbows rested on the water and  watched.....&quot;.  It grabs the reader with an emotional quality that  goes far beyond the particular characters and even the particular setting.  This is a book to be savored, thought about deeply, and, perhaps even read  for a second time.	2000-03-07

And this it is the story of postwar Germany.<br />I had been tempted to put the book down at the beginning.  At first I was annoyed at what seemed like an awkward translation, too much  description of buildings and scenery and the romantic details of the love  story between the teen-age boy and an older woman.  I'm glad I pushed on  though as the complexity of the story deepened.<br />Questions were raised.  Deep moral questions.  Questions of law.  Questions of conscience.  How  does a generation of young Germans too young to have personally experienced  the Third Reich deal with the past?  How do they view their parents?  What  are the internal struggles of the individuals?  At what point are choices  made?  And what exactly is love?<br />There are no easy answers.<br />This book  examines some unexplored issues though characters so real that I feel that  I know them.  It never answers the questions it raised.  Instead, however,  it enriches perception and understanding.	2000-03-07

There is wit, comedy and some funny, ribald and yet strangely honest scenes  as the younger man explores the transvestite world of cross dressing and  finds himself enjoying transsexual prostitutes, each one of whom become  interesting and sympathetic characters themselves.<br />The book is about the  developing relationship between Louis and Henry,  a modern odd couple who  look at the world through their own eccentricities.  I found myself looking  forward to the refreshing break of picking up the book and entering the  unique world the author had created.	2000-03-06

He's strongest when describing personal anecdotes such as the one in which Harry S. Truman was  gifted with a torah from the Israeli delegation and had no idea what a  torah was.  He thanked the Israelis profusely though and said &quot;I've  always wanted one of these.&quot;  I have to smile.  Politics sure have  changed.  I can't believe an American president today would not have a  cadre of handlers briefing him on his every move.<br />I particularly liked  some of his analyses of the United Nations and the challenges it faces  because human beings see themselves as part of a nation-state, not as  citizens of the world.  He gives the example of the first men to walk on  the moon who planted an American flag.  Nobody thought about planting a  flag from &quot;Planet Earth&quot;.<br />Like a true talmudic scholar Eban is  quick to see both sides of an issue and a central theme of the book is that  you can't look to the past to predict the future.  He gives example after  example where surprises occurred in recent history that nobody had ever  expected or predicted, such as the collapse of the Soviet Union.<br />As I'm  not that acquainted with many details of history I found some of the book a  little dense.  I had to read the chapter on the Oslo Accords twice with a  yellow highlighter in my hand to finally understand.  This was a peace  accord negotiated in Norway in 1992 which led the historic photo of Arafat  and Rabin shaking hands.  It worked because the Norwegians are neutral.  He  feels that when the U.S. tries to broker a peace agreement, it creates  problems because everyone knows that Israel is a U.S. ally.  We have all  see the latest peace negotiations on American soil fall apart in the past  few months which definitely illustrates this point.<br />The book whetted my  appetite to learn more and that is good.	2000-03-02

A former drug user herself, they now have two small children and have etched out a life for themselves in upstate New York.  She wants him to quit the business,  but he is addicted to the adventure.  This is big-time stuff, 10 tons or  more, and the risks are high.  The law is after him and the penalty is life  imprisonment without parole. The plot moved swiftly and caught me up in the  drama of their lives.<br />If I have any criticism, it is that there are a  few too many loving family scenes, but perhaps this was necessary given the  nature of the situation. After all, this book actually humanizes drug  dealers.	2000-03-01

The Church and the Peruvian  government want to suppress this information, so there is an attempt at a  plot.  Most of the time I was bored and annoyed at the book, whose  &quot;insights&quot; were certainly not new.  All the characters seemed the  same, and the story was silly.  I was prepared to write a scathing  review.<br />And then I thought about it some more and have softened my  attitude.  The basic concept of the book is one of hope.  The vision it  leaves is that the world is evolving into a far far better place.  Not only  that, but each one of us, by just being aware of the insights in our daily  lives, can carry the message and make this nirvana happen sooner.  And this  hope I speak about is not just a personal salvation, but a salvation for  the whole human race. This little book makes it all seem possible.<br />I  don't think this book meant to be viewed as literature.  It isn't.  It's a  positive message about the meaning of life.  In that, the author succeeded.  I would recommend it for curiosity seekers who would be willing to plod  through it for this message.  And, frankly, I'm glad I read it.	2000-03-01

The pace was slow, the mood dreamy and the characters interesting.<br />The theme is contemporary -- a 41-year old successful female architect, unmarried and pregnant by choice,  visits her home town of Spokane Washington to come to terms with her past.  Her childhood has been broken by her mother's desertion when she was 9  years old, and her memories of her childhood with her father and brother  haunt her.  Little by little, the reader is drawn into the story of her  family and the final resolution brings completion to her questions about  the past.<br />The story is small but the writing is good, and I was drawn  into the character's thought processes and memories.  It was a pleasant,  if not challenging, read, and a good example of mood and setting.  Recommended if you're looking for a well-told exploration of this woman's  story.	2000-02-26

Of course it's over exaggerated.  And filled with gossip about people I never heard of. The plot is simple.  Which of five books will be the bestseller?<br />Within the first few pages  I knew who would be the best-selling author and immediately confirmed it by  finding the answer in the last few pages of the book.  I didn't have to  continue reading.  Believe me, I feel  no obligation to finish books.  I  read for pleasure.  And I won't waste my time on something I don't like.  But I couldn't put the book down.  Just kept reading and reading and  reading.  Why?<br />In the tradition of the Jacqueline Susanne and Jackie  Collins, Ms. Goldsmith simply knows how to tell a good story.  As expected  in a book published today, she doesn't use flashbacks. To add depth to a  character she simply gives a page or two of narrative in her early  chapters.<br />I read this book a little at a time.  And thought about it all  day long.  I lived with the silly characters, all of them more characatures  than characters.  So predictable that I didn't have to continue.  But I  found myself thinking about the story a lot, and anxiously picked it up  whenever I could.  It brought back memories of my early days of reading,  when a book was nothing put pure entertainment.  And, after all, isn't that  what reading is all about?	2000-02-26

It is his last<br />major work at age 60; he killed himself the following year.<br />In an<br />introduction by James Mitchner, it is explained that this piece was<br />commissioned by Life Magazine.  The assignment was for Hemmingway to<br />revisit the bullfights he had written about in his classic novel<br />&quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot; published in 1940.  Hemingway was<br />supposed to write 10,000 words for the article.  Instead, he submitted<br />120,000 words.  It was edited down to 70,000 words and ran in three<br />installments.<br />This book I read, however, was only about 45,000 words<br />and focuses specifically on the particular contests between two<br />competing matadors who happened to be brothers in law.  Hemingway had<br />a personal relationship with both of them and brings the reader to the<br />dinners and the parties as well as to the infirmary after a goring,<br />the painful healing process in Spanish hospitals that do not<br />administer painkillers, the long rides on bad roads between bullfights<br />and the dirt and heat and fatigue and glory.<br />I have not read much of<br />Hemingway and knew nothing at all about bullfighting when I started<br />reading.  Yet, by the end of the book a portrait of the author emerges<br />as well as an understanding of the history, tradition choreographed<br />performance of skill that occurs in the bull ring.  Somehow, I was<br />able to move beyond my personal feelings about the slaughter of the<br />bull, and get into the mindset of Hemingway and the people of Spain,<br />where bullfighting is a national passion.<br />It has to do with courage.<br />And it has to do with facing death.<br />Hemmingway said it all it better<br />than I ever could:<br />&quot;This was Antonio's regular appointment with<br />death that we had to face every day.  Any man can face death but to be<br />committed to bring it as close as possible while performing certain<br />classic movements and do this again and again and again and then deal<br />it out yourself with a sword to an animal weighing half a ton which<br />you love is more complicated than facing death.&quot;certain classic movements and do this again and again and again and then deal it out yourself with a sword to an animal weighing half a ton which you love is more complicated than facing death.&quot;	2000-02-23

I never got all the characters straight, even the major ones.  I found it almost impossible to follow the  story line. And I found myself falling asleep after just a few pages.  However, I plodded on.  After all, wasn't this book recommended by Oprah?  Didn't this book get rave reviews?  Isn't Toni Morrison a Pulitzer Prize  winner and a professor at Princeton?<br />It's 318 long long pages and I had  to push myself to read it.  Halfway through the book I almost put it down.  Why was I still getting the characters mixed up.  Why wasn't I moved by  some of their stories?  I hoped it would get better after I passed the  half-way mark.  It didn't.<br />The tone is heavy and depressing.  The  characters each have deep dark ugly secrets.  There is rarely any relief  from the long artistic, somewhat poetic sentences.  I didn't understand the  ending, but at least it was over.	2000-02-19

Trouble was coming though, although  no one at that time could have imagined the horror.<br />Swain also went to  Vietnam, which at the time was full of Americans.  He rode on helicopters  out to the battlefield, helped rescue victims of a bombing in a movie  theater, and fell in love.  His descriptions and experiences, from a  British point of view, adds his own special twist to the vast body of work  I have read about Vietnam by Americans.<br />In spite of the danger, he  voluntarily returned to Cambodia to experience the fall of Phnom Penh to  the Khmer Rouge and would have been executed if it were not for the  intervention of Dith Pran, the Cambodian journalist who is best known for  his role in the movie The Killing Fields.  Swain was captive in the French  Embassy and experienced the agony of families being torn apart and marched  off to their brutal deaths.<br />All of these experiences are captured in  riveting detail and I couldn't put the book down in spite of the gruesome  realistic details on every page. There are horrors, adventure and a lust  for writing a good story and reporting the truths to the world.  I applaud  him and the profession of journalism for that.	2000-02-19

It is the story of a young girl who is sold to a geisha house at the age of  nine.  The reader is plunged into her world,  following her life through  the 1930s, when there were more than 800 geishas in the city of Kyoto,  through the war, and right up to today.<br />I identified with her completely,  felt her pain at her abandonment, her attempt to run away, her struggle to  adapt, her innocence of what is expected of her, and the fierce competition  and cruelty of the other geishas. The details of her training are  fascinating -- from the way she learns to pour tea and expose just the  inside of her wrist as a way of flirting -- to the discomfort of sleeping  in the elaborate waxed hairdos.<br />Her story is told simply, in a clear  authentic voice.  But it goes deep into what it is to be Japanese and live  in a world where every movement is structured.  My understanding of Japan  was deepened  as I got right into the skin of the characters.<br />I read the  book slowly on purpose because I just didn't want it to end, and I found  myself thinking about it all the time.  Don't miss the joy of reading it.  I give it my very highest recommendation.	2000-02-18

And then haunted my dreams.  Joyce Carol Oates has created a small work of art. Filled with disturbing emotional intensity, it is a non-stop journey into  the darkest places of a human soul.<br />On the surface, the story is simple.  Against the landscape of Oates' familiar upstate New York territory, Ingrid  is born to a Vietnam veteran and his young wife. The Vietnam vet is accused  of murder and must go into hiding and during the next few years there are  several secret visits.  It cumulates in another act of serious violence.  As Ingrid grows up she is used and abused by boys and men, finally joining  a Satanic cult and almost dying as a result of their abuse.  However,  through the eyes of Joyce Carol Oates, this is not a simple story at  all.<br />Oates uses the first person throughout which makes the reader see  the world through Ingrid's eyes, feel Ingrid's pain, and want to help  Ingrid scratch all her insect bites till they bleed.  Ingrid inhabits a sad  and disturbing world.  This is a harsh book.  The violence is sick.  It is  hard to read.<br />But I couldn't put it down.  Couldn't let myself be  anything but drawn into Ingrid's world.  And couldn't help feeling the  gut-wrenching emotion that was constant throughout.<br />Oates follows her own  rules in the writing.  It is ungrammatical in places. Paragraphs are  sometimes several pages long.  Much of it is stream of consciousness.  And  there are jumps without explanations that plunge into yet new forms of  despair.<br />I will never forget the character of Ingrid, or that of her  mother.  They are defined by the thousands of details of their lives that  Oates describes through the distorted prism of Ingrid's memories.<br />This  dark journey into the depths of the soul is not for everyone.  It's too  startling.  Too intense.  But somehow I feel it has enriched my life.  And  isn't that what art is all about?	2000-02-18

The  people who provide the behind-the-scenes services of cooking and cleaning  and laundry live and breath on these pages, as does the madam and the  constantly changing stream of prostitutes, co-existing with a conservative  community and frequented by most of the men from the town.  Racial  attitudes and the cultural changes during these years are all vividly  drawn.<br />There are secrets too.  Murder.  Incest.  Suicide.  While this  moves the plot along, not everything here rings true, however, and in spite  of the easy flow of the reading, this is a weakness of this book.  I also  couldn't help getting bored although there were enough twists and turns of  the plot to hold my interest.<br />Books have many purposes.  Not all of  them are works of art.  Some of them are simply entertaining escapes that  balance the complexities of our lives. This is one of those books,  recommended as a fast read on a rainy day.	2000-02-13

This little gem of a book kept me up awake until I finished every word.  It is the story of the impact that an American teacher, Katherine, makes on a class of students in the 1980s, after the death of Mao and during a time  of change.  The teacher brings new ways of thinking to her students.  And  danger.<br />The language is simple, evocative and clear.  The voice is fresh.  Simple sentences opened worlds of understanding for me.  The main  character, Zebra, is in her late twenties.  She is confused with the  changes around her.  She was brought up to worship communism and Chairman  Mao, was sent to a labor camp as a teenager, now works in a factory and  lives in an overcrowded apartment with her parents and brother. Life is  harsh for her and those around her.  And then the American teacher, with  her western ways comes into their life.<br />Concepts such as travel, choice,  moving from place to place are introduced. The students learn to talk about  how they feel about things, which is something that Chinese people just  don't do.  There's a intertwining love story including obsession and  deception.  And all of this is under the watchful eyes of the government,  who control every aspect of Chinese life and signs of individualism are  looked at with suspicion.<br />We, Americans, walk around with our eyes closed  too. We can't quite understand what we're dealing with in China.  I've read  articles about this. But through this simple novel of a sparse 254 pages, I  began to understand.	2000-02-12

Everest Disaster	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Human errors, tradgedy -- and also great beauty	This is a fascinating, journalistic account of the Mt. Everest climb in 1996 which left six climbers dead.  Krakauer was sent on the expedition to write an article about the commercialization of climbing Everest.  He was an experienced climber and in good physical shape. He expected the climb to  be difficult but had no idea of what was really in store of the group.<br />I  learned a lot about mountain climbing in general,  Everest in particular,  and the passion of the mountaineers to reach the top.  I personally can't  see the appeal, but that's not the fault of the book.  Climbing Everest is  expensive ($65,000 climbing for each person to start), takes a minimum of  two months, is torturous to the body (from gastro-intestinal parasites and  respiratory ailments to serious illnesses resulting from oxygen  deprivation, crippling frostbite and accidents from falling rocks and  slippery terrain.<br />There were a few details which I wish he would have  described better -- such as the food they ate, their mountain climbing  gear, general bathing and toileting accommodations.  There was also such a  big cast of characters, that I sometimes got them confused.  Also, the  paperback edition of the book I read had very few pictures and I couldn't  quite follow the route<br />However, the writer did a good job of describing  the physical torture and hardships as well as the beauty and the majesty of  Everest.  He especially did a good job of describing the politics, the  personalities, the in-fighting and the moral choices.  Especially when  things went wrong, it was chilling to read about some of the individual's  insensitivity.  He makes no excuses, but the human errors in judgment which  led to the tragedy as well as the unpredictability of nature are deeply  explored. There are no easy answers and I found his approach wonderful in  its honesty and willingness to grapple with some serious issues.<br />I was  left with a new appreciation for the forces of nature.	2000-02-12

His family was New Orleans French and he was raised a Catholic. The Village at that time represented freedom and new ways of thinking.  It  was a world of artists and writers.  A world of intellectual and sexual  freedom.  A world where the latest in psychological theory was being taught  at the New School by leaders in the field.  There was peace and prosperity  and a bright new world for the young.<br />Especially since it was written in  1989, when Broyard was a writer with ripened talent, it is especially  interesting.  Broyard looks back at himself and the world as it existed  then with a mature perspective and a sense of humor that kept me giggling  as I turned the pages.  His is not the voice of a disaffected beat  generation;  it is the voice of a wide-eyed young man coming of age at a  time when anything seemed possible.  He writes about abstract art, jazz,  going to dance clubs in Spanish Harlem, meeting H.W. Auden and a funny  incident with the wife of Dylan Thomas.  There's a lot about sex and his  various girlfriends.  And apartments with bathtubs in the kitchen and a  toilet in the hall.  It is a history of New York as I've never quite seen  it before.<br />At 147 pages, this book seems much too short and I understand  from the postscript that he became ill before he had a change to finish it.  Too bad.  Because I thoroughly enjoyed it.  And am so glad that his wife  decided to publish it now.  I love the writing.  It's simple prose with  lots of good thinking behind it.  A pure delight to read.	2000-02-12

Her sister was involved in a sadomasochistic  relationship and she suspects this man is responsible.  She soon becomes  involved with him also, and the &quot;who done it&quot; part of the mystery  deepens.  Of course I read the last chapter; I always do; but this didn't  lessen the impact at all.  The story moves fast, the writing is complex,  and the sex scenes are frequent, violent, and explicit.<br />I've read two  books recently that have these kinds of scenes:  one was &quot;The End of  Alice&quot; about a child molester; the other was &quot;In The Cut&quot;  which was about a serial killer. Many years ago I read &quot;The Story of  O,&quot; which also has this quality. &quot;Topping From Below&quot;, like  these, is not for everyone.  Many of the scenes will make you cringe.  There's psychological and physical cruelty and scenes including whips,  chains and bestiality.  The title refers to an expression that supposedly  comes from the sadomasochist culture. The &quot;top&quot; is the dominant  partner;  the &quot;bottom&quot; is the submissive.  If the submissive  starts to gain control, it's called &quot;Topping From Below&quot;.<br />You  might throw this book away in disgust, but it will surely haunt your  nightmares, take you away from the comfortable and hurl you into a world  where pain and degradation is a sexual turn on.<br />For the adventurous  only.  But be forewarned.	2000-02-09

Through her eyes, we hear the story of her mother, Sibyl Danforth, a lay midwife, who goes on trial when one of her  home births goes terribly wrong.<br />Through Connie's eyes, the reader is  taken on a page-turning journey by a well-crafted narrative that moves back  and forth in time like a jigsaw puzzle.  We feel the emotions of her  first kiss as well as her feelings about  seeing her loving family endure  this event.  The writer captures everything -- the nuances of the parents  marriage, the deep belief her mother has for her calling to be a midwife,  the seasonal changes in the State of Vermont, the controversy between home  and hospital birth, and the wonder of the birth process itself.<br />The story  moves swiftly, pulling the reader into the time, place and internal  feelings of Connie as well as the people around her. The physical  descriptions of the births and the detailed medical information was  fascinating and essential to the plot of the story.<br />The writer is a man,  but you'd never know it and I applaud him for this wonderful book which  will echo in my mind for a long time.  I literally could not put it down  and, even though I had peeked at the ending before I started the book, I  still felt every bit of the suspense that the writer intended.B	2000-02-09

He is in his early thirties, divorcing his wife, and looking for a place he can call  home.  His aunt and uncle have been receiving mysterious night visits by  someone setting out to intimidate them, and the book's intention is to  unravel this mystery.<br />The title, Giovanni's Gift, refers to a cigar box  full of mementos that Giovanni, a friend of the uncle, leaves behind when  he dies. The reader immediately suspects there was a murder.<br />The box is  an allegory to Pandora's box and as Grant discovers the meaning of each  item in the box, the story becomes more complex, especially since Grant  falls in love with Giovanni's daughter.<br />The preservation of the land is  another subplot and the author constantly veers off the story with poetic  metaphorical language to make this point over and over again.  I do have to  applaud the author though for his skill with words and for having whatever  it took to be recognized in the publishing world.  I think he says a few  important things about the environment.  But I just couldn't stay awake.	2000-02-08

Forced to flee his homeland in 1959 when China invaded Tibet, he has lived in exile in India ever since, and has been exposed to  other religions and the modern world.<br />This book has one simple message:  compassion for others is the key to saving the world.  A person doesn't  have to be religious to do this. Indeed, there have been many abuses in  history by people professing to follow one religion or other.  The message  he brings, however, is directly to individuals and it is call to move away  from self-centeredness and care about others.<br />The book is a beacon of  hope because it makes the reader feel that a better world is possible.  He  recognizes also that we are not perfect, but holds up the concept as these  ethical values as a goal to aspire to.  Its all about basic human goodness  and striving to be a better person.<br />The way to enjoy this book is just to  get into the flow of it.  It's not an easy book to read because it lacks a  lot of anecdotes.  There is no dialog. And the paragraphs all seem the same  size and say essentially the same thing.  It is easy to be bored.  But the  message is so important that is it is worthwhile pushing on, feeling the  tone of his words, and his message which, essentially, is the way to save  the world.	2000-02-02

Meticulous research went into this book in order to recreate the time, the  place, the people and the scientific knowledge at the time.<br />Isaac Cline  was an employee of the weather bureau, which is depicted as bumbling,  political and inefficient.  He is central to the narrative which includes  his family as well as his neighbors.<br />I was fascinated by the technical  descriptions of the physical wind, water and tides.  It taught me something  and increased my appreciation for the forces of nature.  With the exception  of the actions of particular people during the flood itself, I was less  impressed with their stories.  There were so many people and so many  stories that I kept getting them mixed up. Isaac's characterization,  however, was more complete, and even though I never felt real empathy  towards him, his personality did come across.<br />The descriptions of the  carnage, the people who survived, and the many who didn't were very moving.  The author captured the terror and the despair in the raging waters choked  with debris and corpses.<br />With some great computer graphics and visual  effects, this could be an outstanding movie, especially since it is based  on fact, not fiction.  It has all the right elements, including the  hindsight of knowing what happened.	2000-02-01

She writes about an area called  Springfield which does not exist.  She writes about a subway station called  Union Street, a major street called Hillsdale Avenue , and other places  that exist only in the author's mind.  Other historical facts regarding  Chinese Immigration, and the names of other places are also wrong.  Unless  a person is writing science fiction, I expect geographical accuracy most of  the time.  So that was Strike One for me about this book.<br />Strike Two was  the whinny character of the protagonist.  Too much dissatisfaction with her  life. She was supposed to be a graduate of Columbia who moved back to her  family's home behind their laundry after she graduated.  She never really  discussed her college life except for a boyfriend who she really didn't  like too much. The characterizations of the parents was good, and the  descriptions of the laundry were excellent.  However there were just too  many examples of the same kind of actions.<br />Strike Three was that the book  was boring.  Nothing really happened. I pushed myself to finish it.<br />The  writer is young, however.  And she does have talent and a fresh voice.  With a little more maturity she could develop her skills.  It's not a bad  beginning book.	2000-01-31

But I'd heard from several people that it was a good book, and I was ready to read what I thought might be light and frothy entertainment.  I was  immediately caught up in the story, however, and soon discovered that this  was not a light book at all.<br />Sidda, who was brought up in Louisiana is,  at age 40, is a successful theatrical director who has a falling out with  her mother, Vivi, when she reveals too much of her childhood in a New York  Times interview and her mother is depicted in print as a &quot;tap dancing  child abuser&quot;.  Sidda is so deeply upset by this that she postpones  her upcoming wedding and goes off to an island off the coast of Seattle to  be alone.  Her mother sends her a copy of a scrapbook entitled &quot;The  Devine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; and gradually Sidda discovers  more and more about her mother as well as about herself.<br />The four women  who call themselves the Ya Yas developed their friendship as children in  the 1930s and have been friends ever since.  They've kept their friendship  through their teenage years in the early forties, their marriages and  motherhood in the 50s and have continued their friendship right up to the  present, being there for each other through a lifetime of living.<br />The  story is really Vivi's story though, and the place of the three friends in  this novel is of important, but yet supporting players.  With ultimate  skill, the author brings the reader into the deep south.  There's humidity  and sweet smelling flowers;  there's love and cruelty;  there's the  inequality of the racial relationships, there's funny and poignant stories;  there's deep characterization.  And, most of all there is friendship  between the Ya Yas.<br />Once I started reading this book, I could not put it  down.  I wanted to know what happened next.  I wanted to learn more and  more about Vivi.  The structure of incident and flashback worked for me.  And I found myself getting into the skin of a Scarlet O'Hara-type character  who I might not like if I met on the street. She's a complex person.  And  VERY imperfect. And that is where the strength of this book  lies.<br />Recommended.k worked for me.

Hawaii intrigues me and I absorb stories about things Hawaiian like a sponge.<br />On the surface the story is simple.  A Kansas-bred woman and her Caucasian Hawaiin-born husband return to live  in Hawaii with their child. His native Hawaiian half-sister has inherited  the family estate and her 14-year old daughter begin a relationship that is  rooted in the ancient incest culture of Hawaii.  The story is both a  mythical allegory as well as a heart retching journey through the wife's  pain.  It ends tragically.<br />I was swept up in the beauty of the words and  a story well told.	2000-01-30

The words themselves have a lyrical quality as the the tale evolves through  their different voices.<br />Set in the 1970's, Celia del Pino, in her 60s, is  a loyal Cuban patriot, who lives by the sea. Her daughter, Lourdes, has  fled to America and owns a bakery in Brooklyn.  The other daughter,  Felicia, still in Cuba, shows signs of mental unbalance and dabbles in  Santeria.  Her granddaughter, Pilar, a rebellious teenager, has been raised  in America but feels a deep connection with her grandmother in  Cuba.<br />There's a dreamlike quality to the book and a touch of the mystical  as each character is deeply developed and the story evolves through their  inner memories.  Strong characterization is the author's strength as well  as the way she weaves the stories of each of them together.  They've all  been effected by the revolution and it shapes the form of this book.<br />Not  only did reading this book introduce me to its interesting characters, it  also taught me more about the Cuban revolution than I ever learned from  just reading the newspapers.  And it piqued my interest in wanting to know  more.<br />Recommended.	2000-01-30

He is a boxer who is training for his big fight.  Naturally, the local mob figures want him  to throw the fight.  His best friend, Jimmy, is a loser who patronizes  massage and porn parlors, drinks too much, and always is trying schemes  that don't work.  The author uses simple words but yet gets into the heart  and soul of the characters.  I felt their reality as they moved about in  their world, breathed the dust on the West Side Highway, smelled the beer  in the bar, felt the mugginess of the summer heat wave.  More  characterization than story, but I still couldn't stop reading.  A good  first novel and an author to watch. Recommended.	2000-01-28

Not only has it won major acclaim, but everyone I know has loved it.  I can see why.  It has great characters and tears at your heartstrings.  You'd have to be made of stone to not relate to the sad and impoverished  childhood of the author, and his matter-of-fact courage acceptance of  it.<br />The one word that stands out when I think about this book is  &quot;food&quot;, or lack thereof.  It's surprising this man is still alive  and kicking at the age of 68 when I read about his childhood diet.  Mostly  small pieces of bread and tea and sugar water for babies' bottles.  He  yearns for an egg as if it is the most precious thing in the world.  And  when there is nothing else, he licks the grease off the newspapers that  have wrapped fish and chips.<br />The family lives on the dole.  The father is  a drunk.  And yet I can't hate the father.  He comes across as a man with a  problem who loves his family even though every penny he has goes to  &quot;the drink&quot;.  There's lack of clothing, unheated living spaces,  cruel relatives, illness, and the death of little children.  All is sad.  And very moving,  And real.<br />I think of my own childhood.  More food than  I could eat.  Electricity. Plumbing. A warm house.  A father who supported  the family.  A mother who wasn't worn out from hunger and overwork.  There's a lot to be thankful for.<br />It's a good book.  I have to recommend  it.  And yet it took me over a week to read because every time I picked it  up I kept falling asleep.<br />I read a lot of books.  Some of them pull me  right in and I can't put it down till I finish it.  That's rare though.  I'll abandon others after the first few pages.  Mostly I generally look  forward to reading what I've selected though.  I didn't look forward to  reading this and found it a chore to finish.<br />Perhaps I had heard too many  rave reviews and expected more.  Maybe it is as simple as that.  There's a  certain thrill about discovering a book on my own which was missing.  However, it seems I'm the only one in the whole world who felt that way.  Do read it for yourself though.

I looked it every night and enjoyed Tom Wolfe's prose.  But I never thought about it during the time I wasn't reading it.  I never felt the characters were real.  I never  felt a lurch in my heart, a tear in my eye, or a glow of warmth.  I did  chuckle to myself though, especially when Tom Wolfe does what he does best,  which is to poke fun at the pretentiousness and conspicuous consumption of  the very rich.<br />Charlie Croker, the lead character, is a wealthy real  estate developer in Atlanta.  He's 60 years old with a trophy wife, a  private plane, and a plantation he uses for the recreational purpose of  shooting quail just a few weeks a year. He's millions of dollars in debt to  the bank and he keeps sinking further and further into a morass of his own  making as the book progresses.<br />Racial politics come into the story in a  twisting silly plot that  keeps the story moving.  None of the plot is  believable, especially the ending, but that didn't impede my enjoyment of  the book.  I wasn't bored for a minute as I wallowed in Tom Wolfe's rich  descriptions as the story developed.<br />One of the best characters in the  book is a young man named Conrad, who is very loosely connected with  Charlie Croker because he once worked Charlie Croker's frozen food company  in California.  Through a series of events, Conrad goes to prison and  learns about the philosophy of stoicism.  He and Charlie meet in the last  few chapters in the book and Conrad is a driving forcing in bringing the  plot to its conclusion.<br />As the book itself had an unbelievable plot, I  can't see why anyone expected the ending to be realistic.  Contrary to all  reviews I have read and everyone I have spoken to who hated the ending, I  felt differently. I liked the way the it ended.  It summarized some  interesting philosophical concepts and, after it ended and I felt its  message haunting me for the next day.<br />The theme comes through loud and  clear in the ending.  The book is not just a story.  It is about values.  Important values.  Values I can absorb in my own life.  Values I can live  with.  And, given this as a theme, the ending makes sense.<br />I recommend  this book.  It's a good read.ud and  clear in the ending.  The book is not just a story.  It is about values.

It exists only in the author, Shiva Naipaul's, imagination, placed somewhere on the coast of South America.  It seems real though, with a history that is the story of colonialism  itself.<br />Written in 1983, shortly before the author's untimely death two  years later at the age of 40, it is a small gem of a book, somber in mood,  that makes the reader aware of this small, forgotten, part of the  world.<br />Aubrey St. Pierre, plagued with guilt over his slave-owning  ancestors,  sits in his musty bookshop and writes protest letters to the  Times in London and New York.  His wife, Dina, the daughter of a converted  Hindustani and a Portuguese woman never quite fits in.  She has an English  last name and a university education but feels alienated and aloof.<br />The  climate is always hot, fires burn, vegetation rots, and buildings are  crumbling.  The government is corrupt, there is unrest, poverty and  disillusionment.<br />The author was born in Trinidad and educated in England  and the writing is that of an educated Englishman.  The book is short and  he uses his words with economy and precision.<br />The country seethes with  malaise.  The story reflects this well.  The characters are complex and  deep.  And their world is  joyless.  The tone never varies and the reader  is gripped with the feeling of hopelessness and sadness.<br />I was completely  drawn into the book though, reading it slowly, one paragraph at a time in  the subway,on a bus, before I fell asleep at night. It haunted me, touched  me.  Any violence in the book is referred to obliquely in the past.  There  is instead, a feeling of hopelessness.<br />It is a worthwhile read, although  not for everyone.  I do recommend it however.	2000-01-26

It's long, 827 pages, and  complex.<br />It starts on October 4, 1951 when Bobby Thompson hit the home run in the last of the ninth inning, thereby winning the pennant for  the Giants against the Dodgers. The same day, by coincidence, the Russians  exploded their first nuclear bomb.<br />These two themes, baseball and nuclear  war, run throughout the book.  There are dozens of characters and hundreds  of incidents and it all seems like a very loose jigsaw puzzle that doesn't  quite fit together.  It's art the way a surreal painting is art, the tone  set by the author's mastery of language and unique detail.<br />The main  character is Nick Shay, a man raised in the Bronx and now a nuclear waste  expert living in Arizona. All the other characters had smaller roles.  There's an artist who leaves her family,  a chess player who loses games, a  serial killer who randomly kills people on the highway, a fanatic collector  of baseball memorabilia.  There's also Lenny Bruce. They're all were part  of the total form, though, which was, in reality, only peripherally about  it's characters.  The book was about America from 1951 until the present  day and how the threat of nuclear war effected our lives.<br />Having lived  through this time, I remember the classroom drills. We would all crouch  under our desks when the teacher said &quot;take cover,&quot; and I  remember being issued a dog tag to wear.  I must admit that during those  years, however, I never was seriously afraid of nuclear war.<br />Some of the  most chilling parts of the book are the descriptions of a clinic in the  Soviet Union where victims of living downwind from the blasts are treated.  This is in sharp contrast to the description of the blandness of American  life.  I almost laughed out load at the chapter about a housewife in  America determined to get her  jello parfaits just right, tilting the  glasses in the refrigerator to layer the jello.<br />There's a  &quot;Underworld&quot; beneath the surface of our lives.  It is there in  the potential for disastrous destruction; it is there in the handling of  waste material; it is there in various disappointments and paranoias of  life.  Much of this book was not comfortable to read.<br />This is serious  fiction with a serious theme.  It is not for everyone.ere's a  &quot;Underworld&quot; beneath the surface of our lives.

A wounded confederate soldier decides he has had enough of war and slowly makes his way home, hoping the woman he loves, Ada, is waiting for him.  The book chronicles this journey and reminds me a  little of The Odyssey as well as Don Quixote.<br />Based on the author's first  hand knowledge of the smoky mountains and his family legends, the book  transports the reader to a Civil War scenario that has little resemblance  to Gone With the Wind.  Details of death and destruction are described in  gruesome clarity and the long road home is rife with them.  Inman, the lead  character encounters cruelty and kindness, starvation and capture, rogues  and victims.  The author uses words well, and some of the images will haunt  my mind for a long time.<br />The heroine, Ada, has been gently raised in  Charleston and is not prepared for running a farm when her father dies and  the hired help run off.  She almost starves until another young woman of  about her age, Ruby, moves in with her and teaches her how to survive.  Ada's growth into competency and self-sufficiency is rendered with the same  detailed descriptions as Inman's journey and I was left with a new  appreciation of what farm life is all about.<br />The book is good and I  understand why publishers were thrilled with it.  It has a big theme, is  well written, and gives its readers a fresh new way to look at the Civil  War.  Many of the scenes made me flinch, but it also deepened my  understanding of this very important period in history and what it is to be  an American.	2000-01-25

As a child, he was obsessed with the Civil War, and this book, written with the ripened talent of a  true professional, rings with personal penetrating insights as he explores  battlefields and shrines, back roads and public buildings.<br />Mostly though,  it is the people he encounters who bring the book to life. He is fascinated  by, and finally joins, the &quot;re-enactors&quot; -- people who devote  their lives to reliving the Civil War and re-enact the experience for  festivals and theatrical productions as well as for their own personal  satisfaction.  The uniforms must be authentic as well as the discomfort  they encounter, sleeping in muddy fields, being bitten by mosquitoes,  eating only foods that were available at the time and actually living for a  weekend or a month in time and place that exists only in the 1860s and in  their imagination.<br />Well researched and full of myths, anecdotes and  historical facts, this view of the Civil War and the people whose lives are  still held captive by its legacy made fascinating reading.  The South comes  alive in new ways for me, not only as it was during the Civil War, but how  it is now.<br />You don't have to be a Civil War buff to love this book.  But,  beware.  You might just become one after reading it.<br />Highly recommended!	2000-01-24

They spent a year in Baffin Bay, off the coast of Greenland,  completely frozen in during the winter.  His excellent writing is full of  facts, from the mechanical details of getting making their boat seaworthy,  to the history, geography, wildlife and interactions with the Intuit  people.<br />Beyond that, though, there was something more.  The challenges he  faces are stark and realistic and he makes mistakes along the way nearly  costing him his life, grappling with internal challenges as well as  external ones. Along the way he learns great lessons in life.<br />As I read  this book, I was right there with him, feeling his awe at the natural  beauty, his thrill of the adventure as well as his loneliness and his fear.  I was also constantly impressed by his ingenuity in solving the many  constant technical unforeseen problems.<br />I couldn't put the book down,  staying up almost all night to just keep reading and reading.  I know I'll  never take a trip like this.  But I thank him for writing the book and  giving me the privilege of experiencing just a little bit of this wild and  frozen landscape.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-01-24

At that time she was just 24 years old and a recent graduate of Columbia school of Journalism.  A Canadian  citizen, she didn't know how to speak Russian and had no job waiting for  her.<br />She did get work though, writing for some English editions of  Russian papers and freelancing for The Village Voice. the San Francisco  Chronicle and the Toronto Star, and even did a prestigious Playboy  interview with Vladimer Zhironovsky who was campaigning against Boris  Yeltzen at the time.<br />We see Russia through the eyes of this young woman,  feel its corruption, contradictions and dangers.  We travel with her in  private cars and taxicabs to gangster nightclubs and private parties.  We  move with her into a succession of apartments, taste the vodka, meet the  men who want to date her, and share the adventure of a young woman in the  wild and wooly wilderness of the new Russia.  We sail down the Volga, visit  Siberia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and  Chechnya.  We feel the danger and  the eat the foods, and meet a wide variety of people.<br />Ms. Gould is at her  best when describing her own experiences.  However, when she goes into  Russian history and tries to analyze some of the politics, she seems out of  her league.  I found it hard to follow these parts and could not absorb it  all.  However, my intention was not to learn everything about Russia in one  sitting.  Instead, I enjoyed the experience of joining her on her own  personal adventures, which, admittedly were from a young pretty Western  woman's point of view.  Her observations were good but were not quite  dynamic enough and even though I enjoyed the book I don't know how much I  really learned about Russia.<br />I'd recommend this book for someone like me,  with little or no knowledge of this vast and complicated land.  It's like  dipping your toes into an ocean and just beginning to feel the water.	2000-01-24

There are dozens  of characters and not one of them is happy or finds fulfillment.  It is a  dark novel, which is grim and depressing with occasional comic elements  which only enhance absurdities of life.<br />As I got more deeply into the  book, I found it hard to pick up because I knew I would be bombarded with  another sad story of someone's useless and pain-filled life.  And then I  couldn't put it down because, in spite of this, the skillful writing would  pull me along.<br />The stories are loosely strung together, with occasional  flash-forwards for one of the characters, usually describing another future  ugly meaningless death.<br />She's writing about the underclass.  And the  reverse side of the American dream.  She does it well.  So well, in fact,  that her images of lynching, illness, accidents, abusive relationships and  cruelty are not easily forgotten.  It is not a pleasant picture.  But yet,  it is surprisingly<br />refreshing. Perhaps because, in spite of her deep and  colorful characterizations, the reader doesn't feel particularly  sympathetic to their tragedies and meaningless lives.<br />It's a good book,  but read it only if you are unafraid to enter a world of unrelenting pain.	2000-01-23

This book, which chronicles his stint as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal and other publications from 1990 to 1991, captures  the ludicrous essence of his experiences in the Middle East.<br />He's very  much the central character as he chews an intoxicant called &quot;Qat&quot;  with Yemenis, plays soccer with Dinka refugees in southern Sudan and  travels with a pack of reporters to view corpses from the Iran-Iraq war.  Through it all, he keeps a sense of humor and wry observation and, at the  same time, gives insightful historical details of the countries his visits.  The people he meets are memorable, his experiences are high adventure, and  his viewpoint is something I can relate to.<br />I enjoyed this book  tremendously.  Mr. Horwitz is an excellent writer and I love reading about  his journalistic exploits.  I learned a bit about Yemen, Egypt, Iraq, Iran,  Israel, Libya, Sudan and Lebanon.  Of course it was just a taste.  There's  just so much you can pack into a small 280-page book.  However, sometimes  this is the best way to learn -- in small doses and including his personal  experiences that are not likely to appear in any news story.  It left me  yearning to know more.  And that is what it basically set out to do.<br />The  last chapter of the book was finished just before the Gulf War, but the  author added an additional chapter in 1992 including his experience in  Baghdad when the war started.<br />Highly entertaining and very  informative.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-01-23

There is another writer's name, Richard Erdoes, next to  hers on the cover which makes me assume that she did not write this  herself. Perhaps that accounts for the style, which is overly simplistic as  the book seems to be targeted towards young adults.<br />However, I have very  scant knowledge of American Indians even though they<br />have always  fascinated me.  And that is why I enjoyed this book completely. It's feels  true and real and its starkness only underlines the story which, in  reality, is not only Mary Crow Dog's personal story, but that of all  American Indians in our country.<br />We are right there with her in the one  room shack  she was raised in with 8 other people in North Dakota, a house  without electricity, plumbing or a single modern convenience.  As there  were no television or any connection with the outside world, she thought  that everyone lived like this and had a happy childhood, warm and secure in  the bosom a loving family.<br />And then she was sent off to boarding school  run by the Jesuits.  Here, the children were beaten, humiliated, punished  by being sent into isolation, and forced into a mold that was foreign to  them.  It was the 60's then, and she rebelled, leaving school and joining  forces with other Native American teenagers who drank and shoplifted and  lived on the fringe of society.<br />Then the American Indian Movement came  along and she joined, identifying with her people's struggles and learning  the history.  She was at the siege of the National Indian Affairs building  in Washington, DC and then again at the 71-day takeover of Wounded Knee in  the 1970s.  It was here that she gave birth to her son while gunfire was  going on around her.<br />Later, she married Leonard Crow Dog, the leader and  medicine man.  He had been brought up totally as an Indian and had never  ever learned to read. She stood by him though his unlawful imprisonment,  learned to make speeches at rallies, visited other tribes and totally  absorbed her heritage.  She bore him four children and is a spokesperson  for her people.  Hence this book, which I understand had been made into a  TNT movie and is used as a textbook in schools.<br />By telling her own  personal story, Mary Crow Dog gives the reader an insider's view of the  racism around her, the hardships, the religious<br />rituals and the pride of  her people.  For anyone with an interest in this special area of American  History, this book is extremely helpful.<br />Recommendedian and had never  ever learned to read.

He travels by bicycle, and the rigors of his personal discomfort as well as his memories  are eye opening as he faces the realities of what it is to be Vietnamese  today, both in America and in Vietnam.<br />The book is totally involving,  pulling the reader into the world of Andrew Pham, from the childhood games  he played with his sister, to the horrific boat escape where he and his  family were inches away from death, to Vietnamese culture in California.  The writer is brutally honest, sparing neither his family, America nor the  Vietnamese from candid review.  His insights are at once startling, fresh  and vivid and some of his images will long haunt my imagination.<br />The  people in Vietnam are poor.  There is filth everywhere and mosquitoes and  bugs and rats.  He constantly is overcharged and everyone has their hands  out, especially the police.  When he looks at his cousins who he played  with as a child, he realizes that his life could have been just like theirs  if his family hadn't escaped.<br />The flashbacks t his childhood in Vietnam  are interspersed with his flashbacks with life in America and there is much  exploration of what can be called his dysfunctional family.  Among other  things, as there are family secrets that rip them all apart.<br />The one  weakness of the book is that some things are not fully explained. A little  gentle editing would have proded the writer to put more information in to  some of the segments and leave out the boring details from others.<br />However, I did love the book.  I loved the fact that it took me to  places I know little about, both in the geographical as well as the  author's own internal landscape.  It's a modern update of the Vietnam  experience from a very unique point of view.  And it focuses on Vietnam as  it is today.<br />Recommended	2000-01-17

A first novel by this Hawaii-born author, it is the story of a flawed by very real Japanese American family,  including their experience in an interment camp during WWII.  Using the  technique of different voices in alternating chapters, the narrative goes  back and forth through time, weaving a story that is at once riveting as  well as filled with the impact of history.<br />The plot revolves around a  young woman's abandonment of  her illegitimate son and yet it is so much  more.  It is the story of her own mother.  It is the story of daughter.  It  is the story of her brothers and their father. It is the story of what it  is to be Japanese-American.  And giving birth. And being a soldier.  And a  child that is wounded by his mother's abandonment.<br />Most of all it is the  story of human beings.  And the fact that they are Japanese American is  only one part of it.  It is a strong story that reeks with tragedy and  reality.  There is sadness here, and some redemption, and many things that  never are resolved.  It's not pretty, and yet the book just pulled me in,  kept me reading until I finished it in one late-night reading orgy.<br />Ms.  Rizzuto uses simple words.  No poetic images here.  He details are sharp  and piercing and sometimes feel like fingernails being scraped across a  blackboard.  Each chapter is searing episode. Characterization is  excellent.<br />Recommended although this book  might be a little too strong  for everyone. And I look forward to reading more from this author.	1999-12-24

As the daughter of holocaust survivors, she  has constantly been subjected to her parents memories and has viewed her  father's photographs of the liberation over and over again.<br />Now she is a  young film producer, engaged to be married, and when her aunt in Israel  dies, she must come to terms with her background before she can move on.  This is what this novel is about and most of it is one long flashback to  her childhood and the forces that shaped her.<br />The writing is extremely  detailed and the author uses a lot of words to tell this story -- more  words than necessary.  She reviews her past in the very first chapter and  the rest of the story a rehash of the same thing.  While the writing was  realistic, I found myself bored.  I had gained enough insight into her  characterization early in the book and I yearned to have the story move  forward.  I didn't doubt that she would marry the young man and so there  was no suspense.<br />This novel was the author's first, and perhaps too  autobiographical.<br />Not recommended unless the subject matter of this novel  is of particular interest.	1999-12-24

Times were hard. It was cold in the  winter.  And young Harold was often hungry.  But he was loved.  And his  life was rich with the rituals of the synagogue and his growing  understanding of the world around him.<br />Rabbi Swiss writes with passion,  forcing the reader to feel the emotions of young Harold as he yearns for  his mother, studies Judaism, and turns his eyes to the very real human  beings who make up his community.  I can never forget the hunchback outcast  who delivered coal but had once been a concert pianist in Russia, the  communistic rhetoric of the agnostic in the tea room which served as place  to socialize and escape the dreary streets, the Negro superintendent who  taught young Harold to box as well as a valuable lesson in  humanity.<br />These were the days before even the rudiments of welfare, and  if families couldn't pay the rent, they were forced to live right out on  the street with their furniture, shivering in the cold while still trying  to keep their dignity.  Young Harold was one of the fortunate ones because  there was always a roof, if nothing else, over his head.  The tight-knit  community believed in charity though.  And no matter how poor they were,  there was always a bit of soup or a piece of bread for the needy.<br />Against  this background, young Harold grew and observed the world with the wonder  of youth and the eyes of compassion.  He had a spark of rebelliousness too.  He shocked the community when he diverted from his prepared bar mitzvah  speech.  He stole some money that the mob had hidden and bought himself  treats.  He had sexual yearnings as he grew into manhood.<br />The book could  have used some more careful editing, but this is  minor criticism.  There's  lessons in humanity on every page as well as rich and well-developed  characters.  The story captured a neighborhood and a time in history that  is unknown to most people and I wish it could be made into a screenplay in  order to bring that particular era in focus.<br />Recommendedracters.

This book,  published in 1994, describes that interfaith dialog as well as his many  interviews later with Jews who practice Buddhism, including Alan Ginsberg  and Ram Das.<br />The Dalai Lama was particularly interested in how the Jews  survived as a people in Diaspora during their thousands of years in exile.  Tibetan Buddhists, now expelled from their homeland are facing the same  dilemma.<br />The Jews were particularly interested in what the attraction was  for modern Jews in Buddhism because there have been so many who have seemed  to abandon their Jewish heritage.<br />The author writes well, so well in fact  that he took me deeper into concepts than I have ever been before.  There  are a lot of facts in this book and a lot of theology.  I have no  background in philosophy, theology, mysticism, meditation or any spiritual  practices.  And yet I was able to follow most of it.<br />The Jews and Tibetan  Buddhists have some things in common.  Their monks study sacred texts and  practice debate.  There are some ancient words that are common to both  religions.  And on a deep spiritual level, they both practice meditation  and visualization.<br />The differences are vast though.  The Jewish tradition  is rooted in the family. The Tibetan in a monastic tradition.  The Jews  believe there is one lifetime.  The Tibetans believe in  reincarnation.<br />When the question of the holocaust came up, the Tibetan  answer was that it was karma for something bad they did in their past lives  when they might or might not have necessarily been Jews.  The Jews were  shocked by this.  They felt it was blaming the victim.<br />The big issue in  the book was about spirituality, however.  Modern Judaism is based on  customs and traditions and ethnic identity.  It is not based on the essence  of spirituality which is reached in prayer, meditation, chanting and  communication with something much deeper than self, and -- ultimately --  results in enlightenment.<br />I read this book slowly, each paragraph  bringing up ideas I had never even knew existed before.

Sara Corbett, who wrote this book, had the opportunity of traveling with the winning U.S. Women's Basketball Olympic team from their early tryouts in April 1995 to their glorious gold medal in Atlanta in 1996.  She was there when they for the very beginnings and the selection process; she was there for their rigorous training under their coach, Tara Vanderveer; she was there during meals and long boring flights.<br />Through a series of in-depth interviews, as well as 14 months of personal<br />observation, she has written the book that defines the major milestone in women's basketball gaining the public's awareness and acceptance.  Each of the 12 women on the team as well as their coach are skillfully profiled, and their stories credit, Ms. Corbett, kept the focus on the game.  She lets the player's hopes and dreams and divergent personalities emerge through the sport.  Of course we get their backgrounds too.  We see Sheryl Swoops and her adoring husband, we see the explosive personality of Dawn Staley who likes to make side wagers on everything; we see Rebecca Lobo having trouble keeping up with the training; and Lisa Leslie's love for dressing up.  But most of all, we see them play basketball.<br />In 1995, there wasn't even a basketball league for women.  But during the time of their training for the Olympics, the possibility of two different leagues emerged -- the WNBA and the ABL.  This was the major source of conflict between the members on the team during the course of the year. They had to put their disagreements aside though, and play basketball.<br />And that they did.  They played and played and played, wining every single one of the games they played during that year. The women's college teams were easy, but they struggled with the team from China and the team from Australia.  They constantly traveled, and the fatigue and frustrations of a life on the road was clearly examined.<br />Now, just a few years after the Olympics we take the WNBA for granted. American women now have an arena to play basketball professionally after college without going to Europe to play.  The experiences playing for the European teams were usually unhappy.  They were alone in foreign countries with a cultural barrier between themselves and their teammates.  They were treated poorly, and sometimes punched and sexually intimated by their male coaches.  It was never a pleasant experience.<br />The women were proud to be on the Olympic team, but the pressure never let up.  Each game was a different kind of challenge.  I loved the descriptions of the games, and even though I knew the final outcome of each game, found my heart beating during the play by play action.  The game became more than just an unidentified player running around the court.  It was Sheryl and Teresa and Katrina and Dawn.  It was Rebecca and Jennifer and Lisa and Carla.  I followed the action.  And I was right there on the court with them.<br />One of the greatest things about this book, too, was how much it stirred me to learn more.  My experience with basketball is limited and so I found myself screen. I therefore found myself going outside the confines of the book, asking questions of the basketball experts in my life, and looking up each player on the internet to find out where she is playing now and how she is doing.<br />I loved this book, carried it everywhere and couldn't put it down.  I was right there with the team all the way and shared the very real swells of emotion they were experiencing . I shared the pain of their injuries, the strain of their training, the adrenaline rush during the games.  I shared he plays that didn't make it and the plays that did.  I heard the roar of the crowd, felt the strain and the pain, and experienced the glory of the victory.<br />The story of women's basketball is more than the story of this individual Olympic team.  it is about the real opportunities that have opened for women in the world of sport. And, as a whole new generation of little girls are growing up with these possibilities now a reality, it is about the future.<br />Highly highly recommended.ion of little girls are growing up with these possibilities now a reality, it is about the future.<br />Highly highly recommended.	1999-07-03

Even though she, herself, is  not Native American, her books stand as were beacons of enlightenment about  their often misunderstood world today and have been praised throughout the  world.  The Poisonwood Bible is a more ambitious book, and the landscape is  the Belgian Congo, but her voice lays bare the same kind of clashes and  misunderstandings that exist between cultures.<br />Well researched and deeply  moving, it tells the story of a missionary's family from Georgia who move  to the Congo in the late 1950s.  The father is a religious fanatic, driven  to convert the world to his brand of Christianity .His wife and four  daughters have no choice but to respect his wishes.  Using the technique of  alternating first-person voices, each chapter is told from the point of  view of these five female family members.<br />A poisonwood tree grows by  their house.  It is beautiful but it causes rashes and boils on the skin.  It's a great metaphor.<br />There is the mother, Orleanna Price, who struggles  daily with the effort of keeping her family together in a world that is  suddenly devoid of electricity, plumbing and food.  Precious wood must be  found for the stove, water must be boiled to remove parasites, and  vegetables do not grow. The oldest daughter, Rachel is 16.  She misses her  friends and her life in Georgia and yearns for nailpolish and hairdos.  Then there are twins of 14: Leah and Adah. Both are smart and open to learn  about the world around them but Adah cannot speak or move one side of her  body.  The littlest one, Ruth May, at age 5 teaches the native children to  play games.<br />Each one of these voices is totally distinct from each other  and tells her tale in her own distinctive way.  Their overlapping views of  the same incident turned them into multifaceted prisms instead of simple  story lines. I wanted nothing more to go on reading, finding myself in  their world, feeling the heat and the beauty of Africa as each one, in her  own way, discovered her own Africa.<br />But Africa was changing even as they  were .  Revolution was happening.  It was dangerous for the missionaries.  The father refused to leave.  And the family gets caught up in total  upheaval.  When one of the daughters dies and I felt the grief throughout  my bones.  It wasn't just happening to a person in a book.  I had known her  so well that I, too, mourned the loss and  felt their struggle to leave the  madness.  Felt the raging fever of malaria, saw how each had changed.<br />The  last third of the book follows the surviving women through the next 30  years of African and American history.  It is a political statement and it  opened a world for me I never even knew existed.  Often in books that span  40 years, the first part of the book is the best.  But this book even got  better as it moved along. It's 543 pages long and I was sorry to see it  end.<br />This is a truly important book.  It sent me to the internet  immediately to learn more.  I've lived my comfortable life here in the  United States all these years and never had any understanding about what  Africa was like.  In this one book, Ms. Kingsolver brings me there.

The voice is that of a 23-year old modern young woman with a  sharp irreverent mind.  She was adopted at the age of two from an orphanage  in India and brought up in Schenectady, NY.  Her birth mother was an  American hippie, her birth father was a Eurasian serial killer.  She goes  to the Bay Area in California in search to try to find out her true  identity.<br />However, this story is more than a simple tale.  It takes the  myth of Electra, blends it with the myth of the Goddess Devi, adds weird  and outrageous violence, and takes the reader on a roller coaster ride.  This is not a realistic book in any way.  Told against the backdrop of  the  hippie and Vietnam veteran legacy, and the lifestyle of Berkley,  California, the voice is sharp and probing.  The words are sometimes as  violent as the action.  There isn't one sympathetic character in the book.  Many die in terrible ways. The coincidences are too strange, the violence  too intrusive, and the murder and mayhem too shocking.<br />The story haunts  on many levels though and emerges as a small work of art even though it is  upsetting and unpleasant to read.  There is a long interview with the  author at the end of the book.  Also a teaching guide.  I think they were  necessary and even more interesting than the book.  The author was brought  up in an upper class family in India, came to America in the 60s, has a  Ph.D. in English and even though the voice she writes in seems simple,  there are many complexities underneath.<br />I can't recommend this book but  I'm glad I read it.	1999-02-05

This is a modern love story, getting  deep into the heart of his hero, Fire, a sensitive and successful poet and  writer in his thirties who wears his hair in dreadlocks and whose travels  bring him to London and New York.  When he meets Sylvia, a magazine editor,  their attraction is immediate.  She's has Jamaican roots too, and shares  his love of reggae music among other things. Problem is, she's already  involved with another man.<br />Contrasting the almost idealization of Fire  and Sylvia, is a friend of Fire's, a failed artist named Ian.  Ian angers  easily, picks fights, messes up his relationships and is on a downward  spiral of destruction.<br />Race plays a role in the story too, but only as a  backdrop for a deeper understanding of the people. For example, Jamaica's  political and commercial<br />structure is almost entirely black which  naturally effects the characters' lives.<br />It took me a while to get used  to poetic style of the writer and his heavy use of metaphors, but once I  did, I was swept into the story.  However, my reading was slowed down  because of some of the dialog which was written phonetically to capture the  Jamaican dialect.  I wasn't familiar with some of the expressions and even  though I tried to sound some of it out, I know I missed things.  I see that  this trend of letting characters speak in their actual dialog is becoming  more popular today.  In the two books I recently read by Lois Ann Yamanka,  I also found it difficult to follow her use of pidgin. This of course is  the choice that a writer must make when striving for authenticity.<br />This  is a good first novel and a new fresh voice.  I found it a treat to enter  this author's world.

Written in the first person, the  young woman, Amabelle, uses simple and deep cutting words to tell her  story.  Her words are sensual when describing her man,  wise as she helps  deliver the baby of the wealthy Dominican woman for whom she works as a  servant; and deeply cutting as she flees from the slaughter and bears  witness to the events going on around her.<br />I was moved and horrified, and  was right there in her emotions as she simply told this story which takes  place during the dictator, Trujillo's regime. Dominicans who tried to fight  this madness met the same fate as the Haitians as their world, too,  crumbled about them.  Reading this book, I felt as deeply for the Haitians  as I do for the sufferings of the Jews in the Holocaust, or the Cambodians  who died on the killing fields.<br />I must say though, that in spite of the  horror, the book is a pleasure to<br />read because it is a little gem of good  writing.  It also opened my mind to a period in history that I had no  knowledge of and raised the kinds of issues that need exploring.	1998-11-24

I read an article recently about this new Hawaiian writer, Lois-Ann  Yamanaka in &quot;Poets and Writers Magazine&quot;. Blu's Hanging is her  third novel and I understand she has two more coming out within the next  year.  She has a fresh, unique voice -- the voice of Hawaii beyond the  tourist hype.  All the dialog is in Pidgin, in spite of the fact that this  holds much disfavor and is thought of as low-class and crude.  But this is  about a poor family of Japanese Americans in Molokai, who live at the  lowest rung of the society. The language makes the book ring with  authenticity and immediately transported me into Yamanaka's world.<br />The  story is about the three Ogata children, reeling from the death of their  mother. Their father is a janitor and the family is poor, eating bread with  mayonnaise as a staple and being ashamed of the lunches they bring to  school.  Ivah, the oldest, at 13 years old is the narrator, and tries to  keep the family together.  There's Blu, her 8-year old brother, who stuffs  himself with food and is victimized by perverted relationships.  And  Maizie, who at 5 years old, has stopped speaking and suffers in school when  a cruel teacher ridicules her for wetting her pants.<br />I feel for these  children and their struggles.  I admire their courage.  And I want to hold  them in my arms and embrace them.  The world they inhabit is brutal.  I  feel a wave of nausea as they have to deal to the cruelty to animals around  them.  They keep going though.  And truly love each other. That comes  across loud and clear as they deal over and over again with viciousness  around them.<br />The title of the book refers to a time when Blu was so  depressed he tries to hang himself, but his weight breaks the rope.  In  spite of being forced to care for misused and abused animals, his humanity  shows through in the kindness he can show them.  When his older sister gets  her period and is ashamed to buy sanitary napkins, he buys her some as a  Christmas present. He writes notes to his silent little sister and does  everything he can to maker her world bright.<br />Family secrets are revealed  during the course of the book.  And each character is so well drawn that I  feel I know that person.  The family are Buddhists, a world I am just  starting to understand.  This makes it logical that they are in contact  with their dead mother's spirit.  And I understand how upset Blu is when,  after singing in a Christian play, he realizes that to become Christian  means that he would have to believe that his Buddhist mother is burning in  Hell.<br />It took me just a few hours to read all 261 pages of this book.  There was no way I could put it down once I started.  It is both sad and  inspiring. And many of the scenes are shocking in their brutality.  But its  true and real and the story needs to be told.  Highly recommended.tmas present. He writes notes to his silent little sister and does  everything he can to maker her world bright.<br />Family secrets are revealed  during the course of the book.
