Then, contrary to everything you learned about physiology, as he dies he aligns himself in the pose of one of Leonardo da Vinci's best-known images. Accompanied by invisible written messages. That a person with a bullet in his guts would find these tasks impossible is irrelevant. This is a conspiracy thriller and you must set reason aside. Saunieres' posture, various leavings around the Louvre, including the messages, and the fact that he has a granddaughter named Sophie [\\"wisdom\\" in the event you've forgotten your Antiquities 101 course] are all part of A Grand Scheme. Or Schema. Or something. Whatever it is, Brown gathers some obscure mythology, some devious plotting, some innocents abroad and weaves them all into a fast-paced, exciting story of plausible scenarios. Pick it up and it will remain open until you close the final page.<br /><br />American Robert Langdon, an antiquarian from Harvard, is brought in to explain the messages [nobody bothers to explain about the physiology]. Then, to keep the plot moving, Langdon's charged with Saunieres' murder. The real murderer, however, is more than just elusive. He's a monk. An albino, a feature which should make him glare like a torch to observers. Silas the Silent gets about like a wraith, fed the information he needs to accomplish his tasks by the Teacher. The Teacher is an obscure figure, communicating only when he wishes and remaining well apart from the activity. Is the Teacher a key figure in this tale? Is the Teacher THE key figure in this imaginitive story? You betchum! But his identity remains securely stowed away until the final chapters.<br /><br />Any story starting in Paris is bound to lead elsewhere with most authors, but not this one. Even with plots and conspiracies involving the Vatican and antiquities' scholarship, this account takes two sidesteps to Castle Gandolfo and one to near London. We aren't allowed in to any of the Italian museums. We learn something about the title's namesake, but only what is needed for the conspiracy to unfold. We never even make it to Harvard. However, in a bizarre jaunt, Brown conveys us to Scotland! What on earth is pertinent to Leonardo da Vinci in a remote town in auld Caledonia? The Grail! So, instead of Indiana Jones grubbing in the deserts of Arabia for the Grail, we have a Harvard academic and a goddess of Wisdom poking about in the stones near Scone in the age-old quest. It's good Grail fare. These days you can plunk the Grail down anywhere on the planet and make a story of it. And Brown has done just that. It's a good read and raises some interesting questions.

A Novel of Discworld	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Dealing with Dwarfian fundamentalism	Ankh-Morpork, the Great City of Discworld, is proud of its \\"multiculturalism\\".  Except here, it's \\"multi-speciesism\\".  Trolls, dwarfs, golems, even a werewolf have been incorporated into city society.  They are represented in the ranks of the City Watch, that bastion of law enforcement.  Once scorned as ineffective, the Watch, under Commander Sam Vimes, the Duke of Ankh-Morpork, is now considered an exemplary force in the City.  \\"All are just coppers\\" is one of Sam's litanies.  Except when it comes to vampires.  Yet, once again, Pratchett forces Vimes to confront his prejudices.  And we readers to face up to ours.<br /><br />Into the quietly seething mixture of Ankh-Morpork peoples there arrives a new element.  For years, the dwarfs have scrambled up out of the deep dark of their mines to emigrate to Sam Vimes' city.  They've become the city's largest \\"minority group\\".  While boisterous, dwarfs are generally well behaved.  Clashes with their ancient enemy, the trolls, have taken little real toll of either group.  The deep dark of those mines, however, contain a secret.  A secret treasured and sought by elements of dwarf society who consider themselves guardians of its value - the \\"grags\\".  Nothing offends a grag as much as encountering someone who has \\"seen the light\\".  These guardians scorn the \\"short humans\\" who have abandoned traditional dwarf values in Ankh-Morpork's materialist environment.  One of those \\"traditional values\\" is the cause of the ancient clash in Koom Valley.<br /><br />A Discworld legend in its own right, the Battle of Koom Valley is one of those \\"We won!\\" - \\"No, we won!\\" myths so many societies possess.  Each side ambushed the other.  Both sides shamefully ran away at its conclusion.  Legends inspire spin-off myths and Koom Valley is no exception.  There's even a massive painting depicting the confrontation.  And a \\"sign\\" is supposedly hidden away in the daubs of paint.  Or someplace.  It's hard to tell, however, since the 50 feet of canvas has been taken from its frame.  Vimes, who might be goaded into solving that crime, hasn't the time.  He's busy investigating a murder that didn't happen.  And learning to cope with a new recruit - one representing the last minority group entering his City's population.<br /><br />It takes a split personality to appreciate Pratchett fully on a first reading.  One side can inhale the wit and surprises Pratchett produces in all of his stories.  The other side can take pause and note the graceful nuances that represent deeper human values.  Are the grags just fantasy characters?  Or are they mullahs, rabbis or even ministers from the Southron Baptist Convention? If dwarfs, golems and trolls in the City Watch are \\"all coppers\\", are the citizens of Ankh-Morpork just citizens?  Should the distinctions and customs of various groups be allowed to set aside or modify the City's Law? How meaningful are \\"ethnic traditions\\" and who is allowed to decide what these shall be?  Pratchett, with astonishing frankness, wraps these questions within his usual framework of wit and hilarity.  But when you've recovered your breath from laughing, you will find the questions still there.<br /><br />Those who are new to Pratchett may find this book a bit confusing.  The characters, developed and portrayed over many volumes, have clearly depicted, individual personalities.  The new reader, along with Mr A.E. Pessimal, may well ask \\"What is Corporal 'Nobby' Nobbs for?\\".  Many of us are still wondering.  But no Pratchett reader would give up the man who carries a certificate to prove he's human.  And all will welcome this new, worldly, version of The Auditors.  The new reader will meet Angua and may puzzle over her reaction to Sally.  The established reader will gain an entirely new view of this officer - and be reminded that Gaspode forecast aspects of canine behaviour several books back.  All these twists and arabesques demonstrate once more, if it needed buttressing, that Pratchett, even after so many Discworld books, remains a master of innovation and surprise.  New and faithful readers of Pratchett will combine to applaude this outstanding work.

16505:US	50941451	R2HZNM9P594M1J	1594770352	420720749	Gnostic Philosophy: From Ancient Persia to Modern Times	Books	3	49	60	N	N	Do what thou wilt!  It is the Law!	Although this book purports to be a history of a philosophy, Churton stretches definition of \\"gnosis\\" almost to the breaking point.  In the minds of most today, \\"Gnosticism\\" refers to one of the many branches of Christianity.  Following the work of Hans Jonas, Churton argues that the \\"gnostics\\" have roots far back in time, long before Jesus.  The origins lie in Persia, and may reach into ancient India and the Upanishads.  The author grants himself a certain breadth of view earlier scholars either didn't use or didn't possess.  The result is a sweeping vista of various movements, most of which have but the most tenuous ties to one another.  Woven into this rather tattered tapestry is the running theme of the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons.<br /><br />The dictionary cites \\"gnosis\\" as \\"an intuitive knowledge of spiritual truths\\".  That rather vague meaning is applied here with a vengence.  Churton views the Zarathustrans as the earliest gnostics.  Their division of the world into two realms, the material and the spiritual, laid the foundation for many elements of Western European philosophy and religion.  Good and bad, light and dark, body and spirit were the basic formulas by which the cosmos was viewed by successive gnostic movements.  The appearance of Christianity was a major challenge to the gnostic dualist idea, since the Christ figure merged the demarcated elements.  Gnostics, who had at least as many views of Jesus as did the orthodox Christians, ultimately rejected the corporeal aspect of Jesus.  For that view, and the religious rituals Gnostic Christians adopted, a campaign of vilification and condemnation as heretics resulted.  In fact, much of what was known of them for many centuries was through the voices of their enemies.<br /><br />Churton, however, is able to trace the rise of many sub-themes of the gnostic idea through  history.  Besides the resistance to bishops and other forms of church hierarchy, the gnostics had a loftier view of deities.  To them, the Judeo-Christian \\"creator\\" was a \\"demiurge\\" - a deceiver and trickster.  A higher deity, a goddess figure, was the True God.  Even that appellation was an insufficient description and this cosmic ghost become known as The One or The All.  Knowledge of The One granted the possessor with immense spiritual powers.  Thus, \\"Do As Thou Wilt\\" was acceptable in the framework of one who had achieved spiritual preeminence.<br /><br />Following expressions of the gnostic ideal through the Knights Templars, the Romantic movement in art and philosophy, and other offshoots promoted by those feeling constrained by orthodox Christianity, Churton arrives at the key figure in this study.  Aleister Crowley, one of the most bizarre figures in Western mysticism, is granted an entire chapter.  Vilified and scorned by orthodox society, Crowley followed a lifestyle an Oscar Wilde would hestitate to adopt.  Crowley incorporated nearly every mystical idiom available, finally setting convential norms aside with his proclamation of \\"sexual magick\\" in his  \\"Book of the Law\\".  In this, and other works, Crowley claimed not only to have achieved the highest spiritual realms, but was the personification of The One in the guise of Aiwass.  Churton could not have imagined a more appropriate choice to end his book, but he goes a step further.  As a conclusion fitting for the end of the 20th Century, he elevates Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon as the most recent expressions of the \\"spiritual all\\".<br /><br />\\"The All\\" and its \\"Law\\" is the unifying theme of the book.  The All, a deity, supra-deity or megadeity, replaced earlier forms of gnosticism.  The expression leaves doubt, however, as to whether the dualist nature of original Gnosticism hasn't thereby been abandoned.  Mysticism, of course, is boundless, permitting any form of definition and removing any restraint to practice.  \\"Do As Thou Wilt\\" is perfectly permissible so long as you can claim spiritual approval for your acts.  The concept should appeal to \\"all\\" humanity, but so far hasn't even displaced the various forms of monotheism.  At the opening of the 21st Century, Churton's analysis seems disjointed.  He cites many figures, such as Benjamin Franklin, as \\"gnostics\\", but the effect is Churton wedging anybody he can define as \\"unorthodox\\" into the Gnostic pantheon.  With all his attempt at \\"unity\\" he omits the two men who truly unified life, Gregor Mendel and Charles Darwin.  As an advocate of \\"spiritualism\\", Churton deftly sidesteps science, applying the usual disparagement of \\"materialism\\" as a dismissal.  The book might have been a success in the opening years of the Enlightenment.  Today, it's only a glaring anachronism.

The finding of a set of papyrus books might have sundered the Christian world irreparably.  Or it might have heralded a new ecumenical movement undreamt of in an earlier day.  The books proved to be the writings of a Christian sect known as the Gnostics.  This group formed shortly after the death or disappearance of the teacher known as Jesus.  The followers of this teacher generated many interpreters in the years after his disappearance, but these were either absorbed in the orthodoxy created by Roman Emperor Constantine or killed or driven into exile by the hierarchy established by his fiat.  Most of their writings disappeared with them.<br /><br />Pagels, a specialist in the Gnostic gospels, presents the story of the find and outlines the  philosophy with sympathy and clarity. In six succinct chapters, she reveals the drastic departure from what we know as Christianity today.  Although others have questioned the notion of the Trinity, the Gnostics were firmly opposed to the tripartite division of one spirit into three identities.  The \\"resurrection\\", so firmly entrenched in today's faith, was viewed in a completely different way by the Gnostics.  Their writings contest the notion of Jesus as a deity in human form.  Furthermore, the Gnostics couldn't accept the restricted group of \\"observers\\" of the resurrected Jesus that orthodox accounts relate.  Displays of the spirit would occur down through time, they contested, and to all who were prepared to see it.  This universal revelation overturned the sort of hierarchical structure that was developing among other Christians and would be endorsed by Constatine.  The Gnostics felt relations with the deity should be universally available.  Adding priests, deacons and bishops to \\"run interference\\" was contrary to divine will.  Pagels doesn't miss the point that much of Reformation thinking was built along similar lines.<br /><br />The Gnostics were but one of the Christian sects, but well established throughout the Mediterranean countries by the beginning of the second century of the Common Era [CE].  From the scattered writings that survived the orthodox holocaust against them, there were serious thinkers and writers among them.  Only a few commentaries reached modern times, but the vehemence of the orthodox clerics condemning their practices and beliefs has told scholars much.  Until the papyrus writings were unearthed, Valentinus' views were the voice of Gnosticism.  The Gnostic gospels also demonstrate that unity of opinion was no more prevalent among them than it is with today's Christianity.  The role of women, severely constrained by orthodox bishops and theologians, was instead one of equality with the Gnostics.  The Gnostics went so far as to rotate the leadership of a congregation among all the members, men and women alike.<br /><br />Hierarchy, of course, won the political battle.  The victory was nearly absolute, but not easily won until Constantine's interference.  Orthodox writers railed against the widespread and clearly popular acceptance of Gnostic practices and teachings.  The Gnostics claimed, rightly as the Nag Hammadi books attest, to equal authority in relating Christian origins.  Early Gnostic writers laid firm claim to having accounts of events in Jesus' life.  Exchanges between the teacher and his apostles familiar to us today, were depicted as vastly different in Gnostic accounts.  The major distinction is the role played by Mary Magdalene.  The dimunition of her place in the group around Jesus is vigorously overturned by the Gnostics, who placed her first among equals.

We learn nothing of cognitive sciences and only Bowker's personal assessment of what's \\"sacred\\".  From the opening pages, we're led to believe some innovative insights into why we act as we do will be forthcoming.  Bowker's knowledge and erudition are immense.  It's only reasonable to think all that background has granted him a vision of what it means to be human.  Will Bowker provide an informative new view of that state?<br /><br />He invokes a wide spectrum of scholarly sources as he builds the foundation for what should be an grand edifice.  Darwin, naturally, leads the way.  We are, Bowker recognises, the product of evolution.  Although questions remain about what makes us human, especially how our intellect has been generated, Bowker's introductory chapters lead us to believe he possesses new answers.  Science, he reassures us, is struggling to reveal more data on various aspects of the human condition.  He seeks testimony from anthropologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers.  That all this accumulated intellect is centred on a dispute over an obscure bishop should give us pause, but Bowker casts Hensly Henson as a symbol.  Why not, religion is a human universal.  One example of it should be as good as another.  Besides, the essays here are from the Henson Lecture series.<br /><br />As we are dazzled by the breadth and scope of Bowker's presentation, we feel heightened expectancy.  Soon he will tell us how the brain contributes to making us human.  He addresses the issues of the brain and emotion, the brain and reason, the brain and ethics.  But the relationships grow increasingly vague with the turning pages.  No internal motivations are explained.  Certainly, no evolutionary roots, Darwin's mention notwithstanding, ever appear.  Instead, we are increasingly bogged down with culture.  Not human culture, but that narrow range Bowker knows and adores - the Western European idiom, and particularly that of Bowker's England.  Instead of the range of deities present throughout human cultures, we are given only his monotheistic deity familiar to all Christians.  His god is decreed as the only deity to be considered.  Is this the entire scope of humanity's relationship to the supernatural?  Like all monotheists, Bowker would have us believe his deity represents a universal, something any anthropologist would summarily dismiss out of hand.<br /><br />We never find out if Bowker's \\"sacred neuron\\" actually exists.  No cognitive studies are presented supporting such a view, although several have been published.  No neurophilosophers such as the Churchlands, Ramachandran or Edelman are presented.  He cites scholars such as Damasio only to discount them.  Damasio's work certainly doesn't support the idea of a deity influencing the development of our minds.  In short, Bowker's title is merely a stupendous case of false advertising.  He posits a deity as an a prior condition, then tries to use science to support the flimsiest of cases.  It's not clear who has suffered the greater betrayal, the reader, the publisher or Bowker himself.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]iom, and particularly that of Bowker's England.

This account of one man's efforts to revise the defintion of \\"entrepreneur\\" demonstrates the capacity of what can be achieved from small beginnings.  Bill Drayton has created a \\"consulting\\" firm that girdles the world.  Creator and promoter of Ashoka, a foundation dedicated to social change, Drayton uses a highly selective arrangement to locate and encourage people desiring social change.  Their efforts, rarely, if ever, depicted in either mainstream media or even specialty publications, are here explained and endorsed.  As is Drayton's unorthodox methods.  Yet those methods, and the people adapting them to local conditions, have been demonstrably successful.  They need further study and application.<br /><br />Drayton, through Bornstein's depiction, has redefined the term \\"entrepreneur\\" from its narrow economic framework into a broader and more flexible environment.  Money \\"profit\\" is no longer the basis for evaluation.  Instead, how widely can a new idea and its promoter[s] affect betterment of the people shunted aside by pure capitalism?  Is the multinational the sole or even the major means for offering employment and economic gain?  Must the values implied by major infusions of capital, often with restraints tied to the investment, be limited to what firms successful in developed countries decide?  Drayton argues that instead of \\"top-down\\" economic structures, change for the better should come about by local initiative.  How far this idea has spread is exemplified by the map opening the book.  From Brazil to Bangladesh, people with drive, patience and talent have made, and are making substantive changes within their communities, regions and entire nations.<br /><br />The book provides real examples of people who identified a problem, then set about to improve  conditions that had come to be accepted by social inertia.  His opening example, that of Fabio Ruiz of Palmares, demonstrates how effective one person can be.  Ruiz, living in a depressed area in Brazil, discovered how greatly something most of us take for granted, electrical power, could influence a local economy.  Ruiz observed the condition of the rice farmers in the state.  A steady supply of water would allow growth of successful crops.  Erratic natural supplies, often interdicted by highland farmers, meant turning to groundwater supplies.  Groundwater means pumps and petrol-driven pumps were expensive.  Ruiz instituted an inexpensive method of distributing electricity throughout the area.  The farmers provided the minimal investment and performed much of the labour.  As electrification spread, farmers produced steady crop returns, reaching a level that led to marketing co-ops and economic independence.  The programme meant dealing with banks, bureaucracy and competiton.  Ruiz and his associates doggedly promoted their success, finally seeing it adapted to other regions.  It's an object lesson for many rural farmers in the developing world.<br /><br />Drayton's methods require a draconian approach to assessing ideas, programmes and the people behind them.  Once an idea is presented, the obstacles and restraints must be planned for.  A good suggestion isn't enough.  The people seeking Ashoka's support must demonstrate they can follow through and adapt to changing conditions or outright opposition.  From Brazil, through Africa, into the Subcontinent of India and its neighbours, back through Europe and North America, his evalution teams are constantly assessing, inquiring, and selecting those individuals and their plans for improvement.  Money, of course, must be stretched to the limit.  Government funding is a bane to most NGOs, since too many conditions are generally tied to resource allocation.  Drayton's entrepreneurs must demonstrate their proposals are good enough to use with local resources.  Only that way can they be launched into a project with Ashoka support.  These projects aren't limited to developing countries alone.  Bornstein shows how these examples may be applied to any community feeling their social advancement is under restraint.  The models are clearly spelled out in detail.  The only thing lacking in your community is the individual who can clearly identify the problems and find innovative ways of implementing the solutions.  Is that you?

The authors note how pervasive the dinosaur has become in our society.  We live in \\"dinosaur-crazy times with documentaries, colouring books and films - \\"we have thrice feasted on Jurassic Park movies\\".  The authors feel this familiarity is all to the good - we learn something of Nature's ways from some of this exposure.  They want us to take the next step and learn something of what the professional paleontologist does to bring the wealth of information about dinosaurs to our ken.  We also need to understand what conditions prevailed while dinosaurs dominated the planet for 160 million years.  That's a real success story and it deserves our attention.<br /><br />In presenting their story of these impressive animals, the authors start with the general environment.  Dating rocks is a fundamental aspect of how dinosaurs developed over time.  The explain the science of \\"chronostratigraphy\\" using the classical examples of layered rock and moving on to how radioactive isotopes provide dating.  They portray what an organism goes through in the process of fossilisation, and how fortunate we are to have anything to assess.  Continental drift, which at once complicates and explains what would otherwise appear as anomolies, adds background.  Climate is a further tool to explain how the creatures studied lived at the time.<br /><br />With this background provided, they move on to depict the origin of dinosaurs.  It's not a simple picture, as these \\"terrible lizards\\" didn't engage in a \\"takeover\\" of the planet as a given.  It was a long, slow process from small beginnings.  The first fossils, named by Darwin's major nemesis, Richard Owen, were an enigma.  Years of study and conjecture led to the beginnings of dinosaur classification.  The years of \\"the bone wars\\" in North America provided much insight into dinosaur development and diversity.  As the story unfolds, the authors turn to an organisational method known as \\"cladistics\\".  Clade diagrams demonstrating relationship between organisms are used to link more recent forms with their ancestral roots.  It's an effective method, requiring only visible physical traits to establish the relationships.  That, however, remains its greatest limitation and the source of enduring controversy.<br /><br />Each segment of the book depicts a type - Stegosauria with their massive back plates, Ceratopsia with their massive horns and frilled skulls and Theropoda, \\"nature red in tooth and claw\\".  The types are described in detail, with an anatomy lesson provided for the type.  The evolution of each is traced, with additional material on eating habits, social make-up and how they attacked or defended themselves.  Capping each section is an account of how each was first discovered, with biographies of the major figures in paleontology appended.  In this second edition, the book updates the information gathered in the past decade.  The update shows how the profession of palaeontology has expanded and enriched our knowledge.  With lavish illustration by John Sibbick, the presentation is flawless, providing a wealth of new and detailed information.<br /><br />Palaeontology is not without its disputes, and the authors carefully explain the issues, the scientists holding disparate views and how these are likely to be resolved.  Among the enduring issues are whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded and the relationship between them and modern birds.  The authors are unequivocal in their stance on these debates, sustaining their case on the available evidence.  Their approach gives full voice to the disputants in these controversies, providing complete assessment of the data.<br /><br />The book is a treasure for anyone interested in these animals that loomed so large in the history of life on our planet.  Given the environmental, dietary, body structure and development information provided here, another edition will likely be some time in appearing.  If your child mentions the word \\"dinosaur\\", have this book handy for answering their questions.

This threat to a continental resource has been eyed by the United States for many years.  The NAFTA arrangement opened every resource to outside control through its Chapter 11 terms.  If interested parties could once gain permission to extract the resource, then the demand and profit would be the only limitations.  And demand for water in the USA is rising beyond calculation.  In this racing novel of finance, chicanery, corruption and political power, Varda Burstyn demonstrates how the right connections and influence manipulate people for profit.  She posits a viable threat to Canada's most precious natural resource.<br /><br />Bill Greele is a financier well versed in Canada's water resources.  He also has no illusions about his country's increasing demand for this rapidly diminishing resource.  Water has been drained from the watercourses of the United States.  What water remains in streams is highly polluted.  The underground aquifer is being pumped dry for irrigation, industry and - golf courses?  This demand is exceeding supply and Greele wants to provide for the market.  He also wants to pocket the profits providing new water can bring.  With sheer force of will, Greele assembles a consortium of investors to create an extraction and pipeline project.  His field agents have decided Quebec, with its \\"nationalist\\" aspirations is highly vulnerable to Greele's ambitious plan.  All he needs is an agreement in principle to begin operations.<br /><br />In thrillers, seemingly minor events may have unexpected impact, bringing together unlikely people and leading to barely feasible results.  In this book, a former Air Force officer sees his proposal for a fuel-efficient aircraft summarily dumped, diverting the funds to the water plan.  Although not well versed in Canadian issues, Malcolm Macpherson's  environmentally aware - the proposed aircraft would have been both cost-effective and less polluting of the atmosphere.  When he learns of the Quebec pipeline project, Malcolm wants to scupper it.  He's clearly out of his depth.  Bill Greele has a long reach and will use whatever means necessary to achieve his goals.<br /><br />Macpherson encounters environmentalist Claire Davidowicz.  She's not the granny-glasses shirtwaist dress sort of activist.  Claire's a hard-bitten businesswoman with good contacts and knowledge of the paths of power.  Macpherson has inadvertantly selected well, but neither are prepared to face the challenges arising before them.  Greele's long reach extends into many places.  He doesn't influence politicians, he owns them.  They are able to do his bidding and in the current US administration with its \\"cochon\\" of a President, more than willing.  Out of their ken, pressure, great pressure is applied to the Quebec Separatiste government to approve the proposal quickly.  Greele and his cohorts have no qualms about using whatever is needed to complete the project.  Murder isn't beyond their ethics.<br /><br />Privatising water has been in the works here for some time.  Once the hydro system was \\"off-loaded\\" from government control, little stood in the way of other proposals.  One, a super pipeline from the North was forwarded, but it was costly.  Costly, too, in terms of envronmental conditions.  The oil pipeline remains an enduring example of the kind of impact such a construction can have.  Greele is aware of these things, couching his scheme in terms of limited withdrawal.  Others, knowing how climate change has already affected Canada's water supplies, are sceptical.  Snow cover has dropped, and water supplies with it.  The Great Lakes are at reduced levels and the major river systems suffering accordingly.  Aware of these trends, Canadian environmentalists are suspicious of water highjacking  proposals.  Although the rest of Canada appears uninterested in what is transpiring in \\"La Belle Province\\", Quebec environmentalists are quick and vocal in their response to the proposal.  For Greele, things are getting out of hand and he must move quickly and forcefully himself.  Popular opinion translates into votes and a change in government would gain him little or nothing.<br /><br />Burstyn writes well in the best thriller tradition.  She engages a large cast to implement her story of intrigue, deception and manipulation.  Her characters develop well for a first-time novelist.  Burstyn maintains good control over them.  If they represent some extremes of type, that is only to be expected in such a narrative.  Even the minor characters are portrayed well.  None are extraneous to the story, with each individual depicted and placed expertly.  Except for the pace of events, there's little false or hollow here as the persona struggle for success and, sometimes, survival.  With events moving so rapidly, there's little cause for the reader to feel bogged down in technicalities.  She understands the \\"business ethic\\".  We are given enough information to see why she's concerned over a resource grab in Canada.  Her long career in environmental issues has served her well in that regard.

70883:US	50941451	R164Z206MYGKF3	0674016874	55275137	The Evolution-Creation Struggle	Books	4	27	37	N	N	The Quiet Man	Michael Ruse must hold some kind of record for his effort in reconciling disputes and bring calm to contentious arenas.  The evolution-creation conflict has raged around him for thirty years.  He's attempted to impart the issues, describe the contenders and resolve the philosophical differences.  His many books have covered the viewpoints from several directions.  He presents various perspectives as dispassionately as these may be conveyed.  He obviously abhors strife.  This book may be the penultimate effort on his part to parley  the current dispute in the USA over \\"intelligent design\\" and evolutionary biology.<br /><br />His method is almost military.  Assemble the warring troops and conscript them into a single force.  He introduces nearly every figure in Enlightenment Protestantism on the Continent, Britain and the Western Hemisphere.  Puritan Jonathon Edwards stands, if uneasily, with Matthew Arnold and pre-conversion John Henry Newman.  Ranks of evolutionists, from the Darwins, grandfather Erasmus and the renowned Charles, through Thomas Huxley and Ronald Fisher.  As the phalanx swells in number, Ruse struggles to show where similarities imply some level of uniformity.  Darwin started out to be a cleric and various churchmen sought to find a divine plan in the evidence Nature depicted to those willing to observe and record.<br /><br />On the Continent and Britain, \\"creation\\" as a firm stance receded quietly in the background.  As Ruse has stated elsewhere, it was possible for a Darwinian to be a Christian, and vice versa.  In the USA, the picture was different, beginning even before independence.  Distance from European influences and the sense of mission many settlers brought in their knapsacks led to the rise of \\"exceptionalism\\" there.  Not only was the new nation blessed with material benefits, but the arrangement was deemed part of a divine plan.  Implicit in the plan was the notion of \\"progress\\".  Darwin's natural selection decreed no purpose to evolution, an idea which even ardent followers couldn't accept.  Instead, the human species was placed at the top of the evolutionary tree in solitary splendour.  All that was needed to fulfill the \\"plan\\" was to determine the way humans should work out their mandate.<br /><br />Exceptionalism under divine mandate had no hesitation in declaring that the god's intention was to favour those who kept the faith.  The Second Coming, long debated in Europe, found new, and strident, spokesmen in the USA.  \\"Millenarianism\\", either pre- or post- , depending on what scenario was favoured, became a major motif in Christianity there.  Versions of these themes would generate \\"fundamentalism\\" and literal - or nearly so - readings of one of the many Bibles.  Ruse skims over why this movement came to such intense power in the USA, but he doesn't doubt its impact.  He cites the depressing statistics of US citizens in their acceptance of a deity and firm date for the world's origins.  He notes the vague understanding of the role of humans in Nature, with some accepting evolution, yet detaching humanity from the process.  These muddled outlooks are reflected in the rise of first, \\"creationism\\", then \\"creation science\\" and finally today's desperate attempt to keep the divine in Nature, \\"intelligent design\\".<br /><br />With the disclosure of DNA's power to guide life's path, the conflict between religion and biological science in the USA assumed a fresh intensity.  In his chapter \\"Evolution Today\\", Ruse lines up new ranks of contenders.  Still struggling to don them in uniforms to reduce disparities, he offers Ian McEwan as a novelist introducing altruism as a natural aspect of human life.  In his description of Edward O. Wilson, Ruse shows how a lapsed Baptist could still retain a strong sense of ethics, but derived from our ancestors in the deep past, not from religious education.  Nature, says Ruse, holds a promise for humanity.  We need only stop contending over who can best show us what that is and how to recognise it.<br /><br />The problem, says Ruse, is overcommittment.  Both the religious and scientific spokesmen have become entrenched in their views.  Always the peacemaker, this quietly passionate scholar seeks to have two \\"camps\\" take serious and reasonably unprejuiced looks at what the other is saying.  Why do the faithful believe so strongly?  Why do evolutionists tend to slide into \\"evolutionism\\" - taking \\"evolution beyond science\\"?  Ruse sees both camps seeking  human betterment as the goal for all.  Ruse takes a sideways swipe at Richard Dawkins for his \\"boyish atheism\\" as one of the more disturbing elements.  This is an unfortunate lapse for Ruse [although he's done it before].  Whatever Ruse's attempts at quieting dispute, he blithely ignores the levels of violence monotheists are capable of perpetrating.  He also ignores the wealth of recent scholarship challenging the long-held tenets of Christianity.  He forgets that religion is founded on dogma, science on assessment of data.<br /><br />We should pay some heed to what Ruse attempts to achieve in this book.  Natural selection has offered some insights into why individuals find strong stances appealing.  Regrettably, there's been little suggested on means to soften them.  Ruse may provide some reasonable solutions, but bending inflexible minds will take more than his calm approach.

The Swift and Terrible Beauty of Air	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Take a deep breath	When you do, after reading this book you will be vividly aware of what is passing through your nostrils and into your lungs.  You will have learned where the air you're breathing orginated, what assaults it's been subject to, and what you may have to do to improve it.  The air you, and your children, breathe needs attention.  This passionately written account examines the history of air, the people who have investigated it and the problems we're confronting in keeping it breathable.  Although the story grows increasingly grim as it progresses, Sherman finds ways of offering some hope and solutions.<br /><br />Air means breathing and Sherman laments his failure to see his son's initial breath.  There were distractions - a Caesarean birth and the condition of Sherman's wife.  A forgiveable lapse, one hopes.  From that incident, however, the author derived a deeper interest in the air we, and his wife and son, respire.  Air, transparent and ephemeral, still captured the interest and imagination of early thinkers.  Aristotle's famous dictum of the four basic \\"elements\\" placed air after earth in importance.  Few doubted that air was essential to life, however.  Although the air was thought to hold things like spirits and deities, actual investigation of air didn't come about until the Enlightenment.  Shedding the myths, people like Lavoisier,  Dalton and others detected \\"new aire\\" and the idea of air comprised of several gases began to emerge.  More than one experimenter put his life at risk investigating the properties of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.  Even with the new studies, the long-standing idea of the air containing \\"phlogiston\\" as evidence of burning was not easily dismissed.<br /><br />Although all life has its effect on air, whether taking it in for use or expelling waste gases through breathing and less polite means, Sherman is most concerned with humanity's influence on our \\"breathable sphere\\".  He offers a long discourse on the impact of various forms of smoke, particularly coal.  In the Industrial Revolution, coal smoke was a sign of \\"progress\\", new wealth, restructured society with urban growth and gainful employment.  That attitude carried across the Atlantic to the USA as industrialisation progressed there.  As smoke and various other pollutants began choking the cities, objectors arose.  Movements to curb smoke were organised, with minimal success.  Britain's problem was exacerbated by the onset of fog.  When combined with coal dust and smoke, the results were devastating.  A Public Health Act was one of the first serious attempts to address the problem.  Although the Act listed many noxious vapours, enforcement was lax and largely ineffectual.<br /><br />With similar problems emerging in the United States, opposition grew apace.  Again, smoke and \\"progress\\" equated.  There, however, the incipient women's rights movements made clean air one of its subsidiary themes.  Concern for public health generally and children's health in particular, brought many women into the fold.  One businessman, W.P. Rend, declared smoke to be the \\"incense burning on the alter of industry\\".  With other industrialists and many politicians echoing this sentiment, those seeking cleaner air through legislation faced firm resistance.  While some progress was achieved, the onset of the automobile created a fresh problem.  The USA's love affair with cars has been well documented.  Sherman traces the rise of \\"smog\\" in the Los Angeles basin and the halting attempts to curtail it.  One thing was certain, people weren't about to reduce car use and the problem could only be addressed at the factory with new means of curbing emitted compounds.  The impact of such regulation hasn't kept the USA from being the planet's greatest polluter.<br /><br />Sherman's answer is necessarily a little weak.  Although he's covered the Western world, it is his own nation that provides the readership he wishes to convince.  He wants his fellow-countrymen to be aware they inhale 19 thousand times per day.  \\"What enters your nostrils and lungs each time?\\", he queries.  Think of the dust, mites, bacteria and chemicals carried on that air into your body.  He reminds us that there are delicate membranes in the lung, which, if spread out fully would cover a football field.  That very expanse means a thin membrane easily affronted.  It takes little effort to damage the lung.  And those inside your rib cage can only be taken care of by their owner.

If we say \\"Glennon covers all the ground\\" in a book about water, will the reader be confused?  Let's take the risk, since that is precisely what the author does in this excellent study.  From the ways in which water collects or flows on the land's surface to the movement of water deep in the earth, Glennon carefully explains how water accumulates.  He describes farm, mining and even water for scenic tourist views.Water consumption has been an economic, social and legal issue since the colonies were founded almost four centuries ago.<br /><br />The legacy of those early efforts to distribute water to thirsty farms and communities is a central theme of this book.  As settlement moved westward, readily available water waned.  Contention arose between early settlers and those arriving later.  Farm use of water was challenged by mining and industry as communities grew.  In the West, as available surface water was used or claimed, fresh sources were sought.  These proved to be buried deep beneath the surface - \\"ground water\\".  Ground water was a mysterious resource to many - it still is, according to Glennon.  Although it's known that, like streams, ground water reserves must be \\"recharged\\", only a little is understood about the rate of inflow or, too often, the source of refreshment.  In a nation that consumes over 5000 litres per person per day, the availability of fresh water is a major consideration.<br /><br />Glennon presents a string of vignettes of water issues in the USA.  The selection process allows him to present a spectrum of issues surrounding water availability and use.  Although naturally focussing his study in the West where availability and variations in types of demand complicate an already complex area.  The stops include San Antonio, a minor river in California, mining in Arizona and Nevada.  The East isn't ignored - rivers in Massachusetts and Florida are impacted by groundwater pumping.  A Florida case is most enlightening.  Groundwater pumping drained moist soils, putting houses at risk and drying lakes.  The lake problem was addressed by re-filling the lakes - with more groundwater!<br /><br />Nearly every case demonstrates the level of ignorance surrounding how water moves and impacts its environment.  The legal issues Glennon discusses air this problem admirably.  The law considerations range from \\"the commons\\" [where all have access] to those who settle first gaining full rights which followers must adapt to or contest.  Western court archives are stuffed with litigation records over access.  In too many cases, decisions have rested on who needs the most water - the biggest pump often wins.  Glennon explains how the science of hydrography and legal decisions over water are often at best disparate.  In other cases the two disciplines are sharply at odds.  His conclusion suggests these divergencies can be overcome.  A number of compromises will have to be reached.  The biggest problem, however, is establishing realistic priorities regarding consumption.  The biggest problem is data.  Collecting it while water is being consumed at astronomical rates won't be a simple task.  The water is running out faster than reserves can be measured.  When the USA runs out of water, they will seek it elsewhere - a fact all Canadians are well aware of.

Anywhere drought's furnace breath dries the paddocks and desiccates the stock.  Any place where people hold on beyond hope, fearful of change, yet facing only further exhaustion.  Such a town sits on the edge of despair, infecting its residents with a deadly torpor.  What if one of the townspeople decides to chronicle this theatre of defeat?  Which one will observe with purpose instead of ennui?  Most importantly, who will read the story?<br /><br />Astley's run of works has dealt with the small-town idiom before.  This book, which capped her illustrious career, is her greatest literary achievement.  It's about a remote town and its remote people.  Janet Deakin resides in Drylands, struggling to retain a bookstore, which is nothing more than a newsagency.  The coastal papers, some fly-specked magazines, a rack of dusty paperback \\"Westerns\\" or mysteries.  Books don't sell well in Drylands, but beer does.  Widowed and alone, Janet watches her town diminish and the world outside continue on, unknowing and uncaring.  Deakin bemoans the dominance of the telly, the video film, the game pods that are driving people away from reading.  Alone in her flat, she wants to arouse those \\"twenty-six black characters\\" that have inspired people to tears, laughter, follies and hope.  She wants to write for the last reader.<br /><br />She has a cast of characters to draw on.  One man is on the run, but not because he's a criminal.  An itinerant literati arrives in town to teach people how to write.  Four women attend, only to be set upon by resentful husbands.  The liveliest spot in town is the pub, of course.  \\"The Legless Lizard\\", run by an expat Yank from New Orleans and his Brisbane-born wife, suffuses the town with the din of sports on the telly.  It struggles to survive where income is limited and drop-in trade scanty.  Lannie Cunneen, burdened with six sons and a husband who knows that \\"women have their place\\" and wants to keep that fixed, fixes her nine thousand, three hundred and twenty-eighth school lunch.  And makes a decision.  In effect, all the townspeople are on the run, but not all of them are moving.<br /><br />Astley's portrayal of desperation and resentment at fate's dealings had few parallels.  She had an amazing talent for description and feelings.  The power of language seems to flow easily through her fingers to these pages.  She knew the country of her settings - the creeks without water, the intensity of the sky overhead, the loneliness of living remote from others.  Her characters are intensely human.  If some of them seem extreme, consider their situation before judgement.  Under her deft touch, none of them are artificial.  Any of them could be your neighbour - perhaps some of them are.  All these stories are tragedies.  Humour might have lightened these tales, but their message would have been distorted.  The best humour here becomes only cruel irony.  The greatest irony in this book is the reader's final predicament - who wrote the book, Janet Deakin or Thea Astley?<br /><br />Be prepared for a different world in this book.  It's a distant place for some, right outside the front door for others.  It's an untidy narrative, with much interweaving of characters and events.  There are endings that resolve nothing.  Astley will introduce her people who will then keep you reading without pause.  There is sorrow here, and violence.  But love isn't banished and it provides amelioration to offset them.

Since the early 1970s, says Saul, a new religion has emerged, displacing existing dogmas. It's called \\"Globalism\\". Globalism lacks a deity, but provides us with a fresh dogma - \\"borderless commerce\\". The ranks of its apostles view the world through a \\"prism of economics\\". The new liturgy claims that open, unfettered world \\"trade\\" will overcome restrictive government policies, grant peace, freedom, prosperity and will last forever. It will redeem the world of its ills by considering issues through this restrictive prism. It sees humanity as driven solely by economic self-interest. It applies that view to business, government and society in general. It is Mammon in all his finery and power.<br /><br />]Saul's sprightly prose leads us through a chronology of the rise of Globalism, citing some of its most profound proponents along the way. He describes the methods used in creating the \\"global market\\". The prophets are known to all who took Economics 101 - Milton Friedman, Samuel Brittain and Robert Norvick. Globalism's converts, following their initiation, tended to remain out of sight, however. Saul notes the irony of an \\"open\\" system doing so much so quietly and with so little fanfare. Part of the reason for this covert manner was that avoiding publicity was important to its advocates. While quietly lobbying for \\"deregulation\\" or arranging multi-billion dollar mergers, the Globalists operated away from public scrutiny. Knowing the general populace would bear the brunt of paying for their dealings, keeping people ignorant of the impact was important. \\"Smooth waters and continuity\\" was the theme of those who avoided confronting reality. No dissent meant acceptance. Saul sees this approach as \\"management\\" of problems, not realistic leadership.<br /><br />Globalism has achieved much, according to Saul. There have been shakeouts of inept or corrupt government-run programmes in many countries. Giant corporations girdling the planet have been established. The movement of material and products has been eased. Work has been given to those who might have never known what a factory was or what it produced. \\"Agribusiness\\" was an unknown term in the 1970s - it's a commonplace, now. Products on your table arrive from far away places. The shop's shelves are weighed down with a confusing variety of goods, whether grocery or clothing or electronics.<br /><br />These accomplishments have come at a price. The transnationals move goods within themselves, creating an artificial trade picture - and an artificial state as a by-product. The maneuvers have led to grand fortunes. The 358 richest people have assets exceeding the combined incomes of countries containing 45 per cent of the world's population. People are dealt with as replaceable machines and community and human values have been shed. If jobs aren't easily exported, labour is invited to relocate. There are 17 million Muslim workers living among 450 million Europeans. These workers face lack of acceptance, an uncertain status and, often, downright hostility. Recent events in London indicate how long this condition has been running without solution.<br /><br />Throughout the book, New Zealand is offered as the optimum case study. By the onset of Globalism, this island nation had \\"led the world in women's rights and public programmes\\". In the early 1980s that Pacific nation endorsed and implemented the gospel of Globalism into their economy and government. \\"Privatizing\\" was quietly instituted. The tax burden smoothly shifted from the top levels to the bottom. Over the years social programmes were dismantled, resources drained away by outsiders and the infrastructure fall into foreign ownership. The situation far exceeded the \\"branch plant\\" economy often bemoaned of here in Canada. Dissatisfaction on many levels brought a change in government.

108722:US	50941451	R1TFQ5PMTLE08R	0374219737	301593572	Out of Eden: An Odyssey of Ecological Invasion	Books	5	21	23	N	N	Snakes, copepods and NASA's contribution	A growing debate over \\"saving\\" endangered species has generated a rise in ecological studies.  We too often view the issues raised in these discussion in too large a framework.  Dams and chemicals savage habitat.  Denuded rainforests reduce rain and reduce oxygen output.  Disruption of the \\"balance of nature\\" must be stopped and reversed, according to environmental campaigners.  There is another element rarely considered in ecological studies - how humans have been and are introducing new species into global habitats.  Alan Burdick spent much of the past decade talking to the people who are investigating this phenomenon.  This book is the result of his \\"odyssey\\".  In a superb investigating account, he reveals what work has been achieved and what more is needed.  Both accomplishments and unfinished studies are staggering in their scope and importance.<br /><br />Opening his travel narrative with one of the more noted ecological disasters, he tours Guam, where an Australian reptile, the brown tree snake, devastated the indigenous species.  Guam's isolation had protected its wildlife from major predators and thus was vulnerable to this invader.  From the mid-Pacific, he visits Hawai'i [which he's careful to spell correctly, but only for a while].  The snake has almost certainly arrived in that State, but has been preceded by more notorious invaders - rats, goats and pigs.  In Hawai'i, the pig occupies a less absolute value as an \\"alien\\" species.  The Polynesian settlers brought pigs of their own all those hundreds of years ago.  This \\"domestic\\" version is a major item in Hawai'ian culture, and hunting it is beset with ritual.  It is reputed to be less destructive than the \\"wild\\" pigs left by Cook and other Europeans.  Burdick explains how its uprooting practices might add new habitat to forest species.  It is at this point that he introduces the problem of assessing just what values we must consider in determining what is \\"natural\\".<br /><br />With millennia of species' movements throughout the world, humans don't have sufficient record of how various organisms have shifted location and how much they might have changed original habitats.  The introduction of the brown tree snake is set in time - post World War II.  How do we compare that to Darwin's Finches on the Galapagos?  New species either fit into the existing environment or change it to a new stability.  Burdick examines these questions in both biological and philosophical frameworks.  Yet, as he makes clear, the philosophical resolution must await more research information.<br /><br />For more detailed biological research Burdick returns to the mainland.  Travelling with Jim Carlton, one of the heroes of this tale, he follows a team around San Francisco Bay.  The Bay, a major Pacific port, receives millions of litres of \\"ballast water\\" every year.  Picked up at points of origin almost anywhere in the world, this water keeps ships stable.  The water, with all the marine organisms it contains, is dumped on arrival.  Jim Carlton's team is not only counting and typing the organisms, they are trying to understand how the \\"invaders\\" react with the present environment.  The research isn't confined to one area and some surprising results are described.<br /><br />Far distant from San Francisco Bay, James Drake in Knoxville, Tennessee, performed a series of lab experiments.  He sequentially added \\"new\\" species in controlled environments.  Expecting to see the \\"intruders\\" overwhelming the prior organisms or be rejected, he was astonished to discover the intruders and \\"indigenous\\" organisms fit in without rancour.  Even though each had but limited resources and occupied the same \\"niche\\", both survived intact.  To Carlton, this study indicated that all the classical theories of \\"biogeography\\" need to be reconsidered - perhaps \\"turned on its head\\".  In effect, introduced species can create \\"alternative\\" ecosystems.  The result, as Carlton emphasizes, is that we have little idea of what a \\"natural\\" ecosystem actually is.  Carlton's plea for more research and new students to perform it is a cry from the heart.  The work is neither glamourous nor personally rewarding, but is essential to understanding ecological impact.  Legislation is pending on the issue of ballast water dumping, but information remains insufficient to posit specifics.<br /><br />The mass of world trade moves across the seas from point to point - ballast water being taken up and dumped with little idea of what it contains.  Fleets of aircraft, carrying snakes, lizards or other durable animals, depart and land with crews unaware of the stowaways.  What impact these conveyed intruders have remains a mystery in most places.  There are new species of bacilli in one of NASA's \\"clean rooms\\" waiting hitch a ride to Mars and Europa.  Are they invaders, modified from an organism carried in or something that evolved within the facility?  Burdick echoes Carlton's call, reminding us that we haven't had enough time to assess the results of these transportations.  Since we don't know what \\"unadulterated nature\\" is, we may be ignorantly suffering from changes.  To Burdick and many of those he interviewed, \\"we must guard against everything\\".  That's a big task.  To learn how big, read this account.  Then pass it on to your children.  They are that new generation of researchers.

Ranging in time from the Big Bang to the collapse of the World Trade Centre, Pellegrino dabbles in astrophysics, geophysics and spiritual discourses.  He's a man of wide knowledge and experience, and a great deal of both is incorporated in this narrative.  While the title imparts the demolition of two Roman towns, there is a long sequence introducing the reader to the forces that led to the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD.  Included in the slowly advancing journey are such events as the Spartacus Revolt, which used the volcano as a bastion, and the Histories of Josephus, Jewish scholar and apostate.<br /><br />The core of this narrative is \\"forces\\".  The eruption of Vesuvius performed some intriguing and inexplicable antics.  These, of course, remained buried under the layers of volcanic debris produced by the explosions.  Vesuvius sent tonnes of ash and gas high into the stratosphere in the early stages of the event.  The ash, encountering moisture aloft, rained down on Pompeii in the form of pumice.  Those who could find their way out of the city could move in this mostly harmless deluge.  Later, magma ejected from the crater, cooled to become hardened rock which proved more deadly.  Nearby, Herculaneum suffered similar falls, allowing people to leave the town.  A later blast, however, sent a high-velocity stream of gas into the town, killing thousands in a stroke.  The temperature and velocity of the \\"pyroclastic flow\\" was such that, according to Pellegrino, the victims were dead before their brains could register the pain.<br /><br />The victims of Pompeii and Herculaneum become symbols for a task Pellegrino tried to avoid - analysing the circumstances of the collapse of the World Trade Centre towers.  Applying the lessons of the eruption on the two communities, he interviews survivors and recounts the conditions that ensued in the collapse.  One element of the WTC events was the accusation that one of the fire teams had engaged in looting.  The finding of neatly stacked clothing seemed too anomalous in such chaos.  Pellegrino, however, aware of similar evidence in the Roman towns, exonerated the firemen.  Inexplicable calm within a vortex of hot gases and debris he describes as \\"shock cocoons\\".  These untouched zones in an explosive environment are still unexplained in detail, but their occurrence is unmistakeable.  Pellegrino himself appears to have survived one during an airline crash.  He describes their results with awe, but feels that lessons derived from them may save lives during volcanic eruptions.  Introducing the new field of forensic archaeology, Pellegrino provides the reader with a wealth of information in clinical detail.<br /><br />Regrettably, while the topics covered in this book are many and varied, his unwarranted asides add little to the theme.  A tour of the Judeo-Christian book of \\"Genesis\\" is inserted as if it were the sole creation myth.  With thousands of such legends to select from, one can only wonder what, besides market outlook, makes this one particularly relevant.  His account of Pompeii excavations is dominated by a \\"Justa's House\\" which may have contained Christians among its occupants.  For a man claiming broad experience and knowledge, this approach seems limiting.  The book is permeated with such metaphors, which have questionable value in a study of volcanic forces.  Such intrusions may demonstrate his erudition, and certainly enhances his prose skills, but add little to the relevance of the study.

Here, she follows the pattern set in her earlier book, \\"Ancient Paleontologists\\" by examining the myths and legends of Native Americans.  Did they, like their Eurasian counterparts in Greece, find ancient bones protruding from creek beds and bluffs?  Did they also weave legends of fabulous creatures, human giants or spiritual entites from these unusual artefacts?  In this account of tales and myths, Mayor's fluid style enlivens the legends, their tellers and the artefacts that inspired them.<br /><br />Dividing her quest into regional investigations, she surveys the East Coast of North America, skips South to the realm of the Incas, then returns to Great Plains and Pacific Slope.  Mayor finds links from recorded stories to the bones of dinosaurs, pterosaurs and mammoths.  She is hampered, of course, by the minimal direct information available.  She must rely on those who recorded and interpreted the information often gathered from conquered peoples.  And many of the earliest records were destroyed by the Christian conquerors.  What remains of those records has been the subject of much dispute.  In early New England, Puritan Cotton Mather rejected stories and fossils alike as the invalid heritage of the  heathen \\"salvages\\".  In modern times, renowned paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson rejected the notion of Native American fossil finds and the legends surrounding them as lacking scientific value.<br /><br />Mayor, however, shows how narrow Simpson's view has proven.  Taking the legends more seriously, she notes that even President Thomas Jefferson had enough faith in fossil finds to charge the Lewis and Clark expedition with searching for living specimens.  It took one of the geniuses of the times, Georges Cuvier, to bestow validity on fossil bones by declaring them the remnants of actual ancient creatures.  With so many of the artefacts representing large species, the underlying logic of Native American legends depicting giant people and creatures makes sense.<br /><br />The tales Mayor recounts are those of huge, terrifying animals or human-like creatures.  Some raid the human settlements, only defeated by divine beings or the occasional heroic figure.  Many of the stories have these beings eliminated by lightning or \\"fire from the sky\\".  The powers of the giants were immense, but some felt the strength and size might be imparted to people.  It remains unclear how many peoples used the bones for medicinal purposes - reminiscent of the \\"dragon bones\\" of apothecary shops in China.  From Atlantic to Pacific, on the Plains or in the Andes, the bones emerged, launching fireside stories.  The tales show how innovative individuals acquired special powers in the community through knowledge of fossils.  These people could give the artefacts meaning or make them useful in various ways.  There is a great similarity among the many peoples of the Western Hemisphere on what the strange objects appearing from the ground meant.  The theme of giants, great battles and contests with fiery ends recurs often.  When recorded in images, whether on tipis or stelae, they are readily identifiable.<br /><br />Fossils in \\"enterprising\\" North America became the subject of frauds and deceptions.  To the credulous, artefacts take on a special role and there's money to be made in them.  Mayor concludes her book with an account of many of these.  Fossils have been used to support \\"Scripture\\", such as accounting for the Noachean Flood.  A regular business arose in Mexico through a trove of clay figurines purporting to represent ancient Sumer or even Atlantis.  Red-haired giants were \\"found\\" in Nevada and ceremonies are performed in northern Mexico by people claiming to have recent contact with dinosaurs.<br /><br />Mayor's books on ancient paleontology are a call for further investigation ofa new field of interest.  She is a herald for a new, emerging science.  Simply finding bones and other fossils is no longer sufficient evidence for assessing the past.  Long-term historical and legendary records have much to contribute.  Mayor's plea for more studies should be taken up by young [and not so young!] scholars who are open-minded enough to apply new ideas and approaches.  Her clear prose style eases the way for anybody interested in these topics to delve into them and perceive the possibilities.  [stephen a. haines -  Ottawa, Canada]on of a new field of interest.

Overshadowed by the controversies surrounding \\"Huckleberry Finn\\", Twain's version of the Maid of Orleans is too infrequently read.  Yet it was his own favourite among the rich production of his writings.  The reason is clear:  Twain shed all the feelings he held about monarchy and the Roman Catholic Church to write a portrayal in the best Romantic tradition.  Whether the reader is aware of Twain's views or not, the way he tells Joan's story remains vivid and compelling.<br /><br />Twain was fascinated by the brevity of Joan's effective career.  In the short space of just over a year, this girl's sense of mission carried her, and her followers, through a succession of victories.  As he relates in this tale, it was her inspiration that turned the French nation from a defeated people to one marked for liberation.  He shows how the populace took to her almost from the day she launched her effort.  Freeing her native land from \\"the English yoke\\" meant more than military prowess.  It was her wit and persistence which won her followers and converted hardened soldiers to her cause.  Behind the scenes, however, corrupt court officials and a Church holding her role in deep suspicion impaired her frequently.  Twain makes her almost a genius at evading their machinations or turning them into her supporters.<br /><br />Twain says \\"this untrained young creature's genius for war was wonderful\\".  He has her  proving it by leading her troops in frantic assaults without ever killing a man.  His portrayal of the dichotomy of a general unable to kill is magnificent - no other word will do.  He shows her compassion for wounded enemies and her employing a convicted deserter into her ranks.  The author's extensive research is conveyed on every page, as is his feeling for her inestimable qualities.  He presents her as her followers and companions saw her - without blemish, without guile, having a superior wit and given to exacting insights.  Twain is portraying as if a village companion and later follower might have recorded her in a journal.  The supernatural voices are thus accepted as fact - the irony of angels speaking in French and supporting France's desire to expel the English is therefore overlooked.  What is far more important is the fact of her trial and betrayals.  She was shopped by the very people she sought to liberate.<br /><br />Twain's reputation as a writer of \\"boys' books\\" requires modification.  This portrayal of a controversial historical figure can reach nearly any audience of any time or place.  His \\"Pike County dialect\\" lightly intrudes - a \\"translator's licence\\" only enough to raise the account above the pedantic.  Yet, it is the least of his \\"American\\" literary efforts.  The standards of that time are fully retained.  There are no questions posed - the book remains a personal record of events by a \\"Sieur le Conte\\", a purported contemporary.  Joan claimed to hear \\"Voices\\" and attributed them to angels.  Twain accepts this as far as it need be to convey Joan's sense of mission.  Further investigation is unworthy of so exquisite a figure in his view.  Whatever motivated her, she manifested her abilities fully.  And Twain's sensitivity and admiration are also manifest.

American Exceptionalism??	In 1941, prior to Pearl Harbour, the United States broke with a generation typified by \\"isolationism\\" from world affairs.  Recognising the threat to world stability German and Japanese expansion posed, Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt committed their nations to a novel thesis - international cooperation was the foundation for solutions to a variety of problems.  The foundation, while recognising military needs, was laid to avoid war.  The Atlantic Charter endeavoured to resolve problems in anticipation of conflict.  Philippe Sands traces the steps through which international law was conceived and implemented for six decades.  Only now, at the beginning of the 21st Century, and by the actions of two national leaders, is that cooperative foundation being seriously eroded.<br /><br />This important and penetrating study, authored by a man involved in international law at many levels, outlines the path taken in building cooperation among nations.  He demonstrates how the often halting and innovative steps have produced results.  The Pinochet case, involving Britain, Spain and Chile, show how effective and precedent-setting some of these actions have been.  Although there are pre-WWII occurrences of international cooperation resolving individual issues, the grander themes of human rights, environmental concerns and economic liberalisation have come about in the years after the Atlantic Charter.  Advances such as the Law of the Sea, the Convention Against Torture, the International Criminal Court and the Kyoto Protocol demonstrate the possibilities for extending justice and protecting the environment.  One nation, the United States, has either avoided commitment to these instruments, or shelved their provisions when it deemed its own interests were paramount.  To Sands, this is a disturbing and dangerous new form of isolationism.  Sands sees American \\"exceptionalism\\" as leading to global instability.  As he points out clearly, its devious methods and clumsy application have proven ineffective wherever it's been applied.  Global resentment is clearly manifest today.<br /><br />The \\"exceptionalist\\" theme was forcefully brought into view by the younger Bush's administration.  Coming to office with ambitions to control governments in the oil-rich Middle East, the second Bush had targetted the Iraq regime of Saddam Hussein from the outset.  A nation crippled by UN sanctions after the first \\"Gulf War\\", Iraq was vulnerable to outside pressures, Hussein's blustering notwithstanding.  Sands outlines the steps taken by George Walker Bush to bring Iraq under US domination.  Along the way, he recruited British Prime Minister Tony Blair to his cause.  Sands is unable to define why Blair found the new arrangement desirable, but once the Labour Party leader had taken it up, he was \\"in for a penny, in for a pound\\".  Wherever Bush led, Blair would follow - even using the same deceptive methods employed by the US administration.  This included arranging for \\"intelligence\\" to be moulded to the committed path.  \\"Legal\\" justification for the Iraq invasion was ignored in the US and ineptly contrived in Britain.<br /><br />Sands notes a different application of \\"exceptionalism\\" of the United States in one area - its role in international trade.  After examples set by the formation of the European Union, from small beginnings in cooperation to a fully-fledged economic bloc, the US engaged in its own form of \\"cooperation\\" with the establishment of NAFTA - the North American Free Trade Association. This was recently expanded to cover the Western Hemisphere.  Based on a string of secretly formulated arrangements launched after WWII, these structures led to the US-dominated World Trade Organisation and International Monetary Fund.  These organisations, reflecting the aim of Western domination of the developing world's economies, have guided aims in many nations with an eye to controlling resources and labour while increasing markets and eschewing environmental issues.<br /><br />The author concludes with the most glaring and unacceptable aspect of the  \\"exceptionalist\\" policy - torture of prisoners.  Although a party to the Convention Against Torture, the US record in Afghanistan, Guantanamo and Iraq shows that the Earth's most powerful nation has not only flagrantly violated its provisions, but has sought justification for its acts among its resident legal advisors.  Having declared a \\"war on terror\\", the Bush administration promptly exempted people captured from the Geneva Convention.  Guantanamo thus became a \\"legal black hole\\" in Sands' terms.  Unable to determine to what lengths the CIA has engaged in while dealing with prisoners, the author excerpts the opinions tendered by senior officials of the Pentagon and the Attorney General's office.  The use of torture was not only acceptable but the memos lined out what levels of pain might be inflicted!  Note that none of these prisoners have been charged.  Their only \\"crime\\" was to have been captured in a nation invaded by the United States.  It is worth noting that some \\"prisoners\\" were in advanced age - hardly combatants and unlikely threats.<br /><br />Sands' book is a well-written and impeccably researched charge list against the proponents of \\"exceptionalism\\" and military adventurism.  As an advocate of the rule of law and with experience in international litigation, he supports cooperative effort using instruments agreed upon by many nations.  International law, he argues, is the sole foundation for addressing global issues.  The UN need not be the sole authority in determining which issues are addressed and how dealt with.  That body, however, provides the best administrative methods and the broadest venue for dealing with them.

That body, however, provides the best administrative methods and the broadest venue for dealing with them.   This is a \\"must-read\\" book that provides a single, comprehensive overview of how the Bush administration has overturned a half-century of effort to improve multilateral cooperation.

Books	5	5	6	N	N	A "monumental confidence trick"	Middle East expert Dilip Hiro chronicles the runup and impact of the Bush crusade to \\"liberate\\" Iraq.  He typifies the link the Bush adminstration made between the events of 2001-09-11 as a \\"phantom\\".  There was no association between the Saddam Hussein government and the lawless attackers known as Al Qaida.  Nor were there indications that Iraq clandestinely developed nuclear or chemical weapons that could be brought to bear on neighbouring countries, let alone Britain or the US.  In sum, Hiro's depiction of the formation of the \\"coalition of the willing\\" is shown as a tissue of misleading information based on a strategy of fear - a \\"monumental confidence trick\\" with endless ramifications.<br /><br />Hiro assembles a cast of flawed characters, giving a biographical sketch of such people as George Walker Bush, Karl Rove, Dick Cheney and Anthony Blair.  From this background, he then describes the various utterances each has produced to justify the crusade.  From the beginning, he makes clear that the Iraq invasion would take place.  All that was needed was justification.  This was provided by various forms of \\"evidence\\", all of which was either false or flawed.  Tubing for \\"nuclear centrifuges\\" turned out to be engine cases.  A quest for uranium proved false.  And nuclear and chemical weapons claimed by the Bush administration proved elusive - they have yet to be found.  With such faulty information at his disposal, even after some of the lies were exposed, Bush gained authority to launch the crusade from a supine US Congress.  The US media, once considered a bastion of investigative journalism, remained silent or compliant as the fallacies were revealed.<br /><br />From the preparations for invasion, which included a eight-month illegal air assault on a sovereign nation, code-named \\"Southern Focus\\", Hiro moves on to the actual conflict.  The lies and deceptions didn't end with the launching of Tomahawk missiles.  In battles where the invaders were to have destroyed only military resistance, the \\"coalition\\" dropped updated napalm and used \\"cluster\\" weapons.  The impact of these devices on the civilian population remains to be assessed, but by the fall of the Hussein government, more than three times the number of civilians killed by the attack on the World Trade Centre had been inflicted.  And that's the conservative estimate.  Hiro tracks the journal of one young Baghdad woman as the barrage of bombs and missiles rains down on the city.  The Bush administration's contention that the Iraqi population would welcome the Yanks with \\"flowers and cheers\\" proved as flawed as his reasons for the invasion.<br /><br />Bush didn't launch a pre-emptive war, but a preventive one.  A pre-emptive war is an action to curtail a visible threat.  No such threat, especially against the US, existed in Iraq.  Bush's imperialist declaration of 2002, which stipulated the US had abrogated unto itself the sole privilege of determining what threatened that nation, obliterated the distinction between pre-emptive and preventive, writes Hiro.  This action overturned a precedent set in 1648 in the Treaty of Westphalia, a model for all international relations ever since.  Bush also sought to overturn any cooperative mechanisms in his unilateral actions.  His method to garner small nations into joining the \\"coalition of the willing\\" was by browbeating them with threats of withholding future aid.  The populations of even those nations joining the crusade were overwhelmingly opposed to involvement and said so in massive demonstrations, Hiro notes.<br /><br />In his Summary and Conclusion, Hiro notes the resentment evidenced by Iraqis to the invasion.  Even those gleeful at the toppling of Saddam Hussein have no desire for retention of foreign occupiers.  The vaunted technology that guided missiles to government facilities has yet to ensure water or electrical supplies to the population of Baghdad and other cities.  The mantra of \\"remnants of the old regime\\" leading the resistance to the invaders has been repeatedly refuted, Hiro demonstrates.  Bremer's \\"Interim Governing Council\\" even lacked a ministry for religious affairs - in a nation rent by sectarian differences.  The occupying forces, especially those of the US, lacked fundamental understanding of the Arab culture present in Iraq.  With much of that culture evident in the Middle East and transported to other Muslim nations, is there any mystery in why resentment against Bush's unilateral adventurism remains in force?<br /><br />The core of Bush's policies toward Iraq were false and/or misleading, according to Hiro.  After reading his summation of declarations and events, it's impossible to refute his thesis.  His deceptive administration has demonstrated a mastery of \\"spin\\", perhaps only exceeded by that of his flunky, Tony Blair.  Rumsfeld's \\"Office of Special Projects\\", set well apart from the established departments for intelligence, provided the grounds for invasion.  Their information is shown to be either unreliable or long outdated.  Yet this was the basis for conning the US Congress into accepting Bush's request for war.  Hiro goes on to note how the Bush government edited reports on environmental and health questions in order to sustain his policies.  Real information has been shelved, ignored or rebutted to quell dissenters.  In sum, it's clear that this book is a mandatory read for all in the USA.

How many volumes will be required to chronicle the expansion and decline of the Anglo-Norman people in their globe-girdling endeavour?  How many different nations and cultures came under their domination or control?  Will that historian see the first signs of the Empire's  decline in its  dismemberment of a rival empire - the Ottoman?  Britain's last imperial thrusts occurred while it was embroiled in a global war - the \\"war to end all war\\".  The irony of this title lies in that Britain's expansion into the Middle East resulted in turning an icon of stability into today's cockpit of conflicting interests.<br /><br />Fromkin, while not the BE's \\"Gibbon\\", exquisitely details the last expansionary gasp of Britain's global realm.  Opening with the early years of the Twentieth Century, he explains how the outbreak of war in 1914 triggered vast changes in the Middle East.  The events on the \\"Western Front\\" fade almost into obscurity behind the intrigues to partition the Ottoman Empire.  He carefully examines the international competition over what appeared to be useless desert.  Nearly every European power sought control of the trade routes into the Far East.  Russia, long in quest of the Dardanelles as a route to the Mediterranean and beyond, naturally clashed with the British Empire.  France, although Britain's ally, remained a trade competitor.<br /><br />Although the phrase \\"Balance of Power\\" was often used to typify the international situation prior to WWI, the reality was that Britain dominated the seas.  Retaining that situation was fundamental to British policy-making.  There had already been clashes in Afghanistan, gateway to India from the north.  Russia as an ally in the European conflict was an uneasy liaison since her aim to control the Near East remained clear.  In Fromkin's view, the clash between the British Empire and her challengers is \\"the Great Game\\".  The \\"Great War\\" was little more than an incident by contrast.  None of the Powers foresaw the immense bloodletting World War I would become, nor was the overthrow of the Czarist government by the Bolsheviks a factor in imperial planning.<br /><br />The Ottoman Empire, weakened by internal dissent and breakaway \\"provinces\\" like Greece and Bulgaria, sought protective alliances.  Given the enormity of the task and the reshuffling of power such an enterprise entailed, no European nation sought the responsibility.  Yet, the breakup of the Ottaman structure remained an undercurrent in many foreign policies.  Only Germany, seeking a fresh route to intrude on British global hegemony, found the prospect useful.  Bogged down on the Western Front, the use of Turkish troops to embroil the British in another region had strong appeal.  Fromkin traces the tangled diplomacy and military adventures resulting from the new alignments.  The parade of personalities, their histories and outlooks, is almost staggering in its completeness and complexities.  Among the British figures of major importance, Fromkin depicts Sir Mark Sykes as one of the most influential.  Sykes, well versed in affairs of the region, noted that there were \\"no Ottomans\\", nor an Ottoman nation providing a core for their \\"Empire\\".  Fromkin refers to it as the \\"incoherent Empire\\" - a view Sykes continually kept before the Foreign Office mandarins.<br /><br />When a Turkish faction, known as the Young Turks, formed the Committee of Union and Progress [C.U.P.], it was the herald of a possible new arrangement.  Founded on the notion of Turkish nationalism, it struggled to produce a new nation, while dissolving the old Empire.  Sykes, knowing that dissolution of the Ottoman Empire threatened the British one, maneuvered policy to strengthen British influence in the Near East.  Although the present scramble of nations in the Middle East has many fathers, Sykes may be viewed as among the most influential.  In the course of the war and later, he's to be in found suchdiverse places as St Petersburg and Cairo.  He's involved in the formation of various Middle East nations that now command the headlines and news broadcasts.  Although there were many compromises and adjustments, it was, according to Fromkin, Sykes' views that were finally implemented in the creation of Iraq, Iran, Syria and the other nations we're now familiar with.  They are the offspring of two empires.  It is Sykes who is credited with creating the term \\"Middle East\\" in reference to a segment of the British Empire.  Yet, for all his influence and maneuvering, he was beset by strange prejudices - not least of which was the notion that the Ottoman government was dominated by Jews.<br /><br />Fromkin's choice of subject is too complex and intense to allow a prose style that is anything more than straightforward and informative.  Even so, the behaviour of his cast renders embellishment unnecessary.  Each attempt by people such as Churchill, Balfour, Lloyd George, and the multitude of Turkish and Arab plotters, schemers and manipulators to guide events, seems to prove elusive.  Fromkin follows their maneuverings and attempts to resolve differences with superiour skill.  The book reads almost as a shining example of adventure or spy fiction.  Nothing may be skipped, and he keeps the various threads of intrigue and manipulation under tight control.  It takes a special talent to make an historical account a \\"page-turner\\", and Fromkin achieves that in this book with deceptive ease.

With brilliant prose, Padilla enacts a complex scenario traversing several generations and nationalities. The theme is mixed identities and how we can delude ourselves as much as we can others. The complexity is enhanced by the use of chess-playing as an underlying aspect. Narrated by four men, Ukrainian, British and Austrian, we are led through the horrors of World War I to the bizarre loyalties engendered by the rise of Hitler in the post-war era. Chess becomes the means of identification and communication for men whose grasp of reality, no matter how forcefully it confronts them, seems to be slippery. Each character is haunted by dark memories and a bleak future. The futures, wholly Sophoclean, must be fulfilled. Only the ongoing confusion of identities offers any diversion from inevitability.<br /><br />While Padilla's captivating prose maintains a riveting command of the reader's attention, closing the book results only in a terrible let-down. In the final analysis, the tale is pointless. Awareness of the rationale for the book comes late, as it should, but offers no solution for what Padilla poses as the essential issue. Who was the man stretching a rope in Tel Aviv in May, 1962? Was there a conspiracy by the Nazi leadership to distract pursuers at the war's end with doubles? Does it matter?<br /><br />It is easy to be dazzled by Padilla's deft language ability. His sense of history is strong, exhibiting sound knowledge of places and events. He uses Sophocles as a model to deflect our attention from options and choices life offers. He manipulates the characters like a divinity. Even the swift changes of identity by the men don't appear as rational choices, but something imposed by Fate. These are caricatures of lives and not very good caricatures at that. These men are automatons, driven by dreams and memories, clumsy puppeteers at best. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]	2005-08-01

Yet, the record demonstrates that Darwin's Britain, after sprouting the two men, Darwin and Albert Russel Wallace, who spawned the idea, continued to produce the greatest thinkers on issues of evolution by natural selection. Kohn isn't the first to note this fact.  Instead of binding Darwin's idea to \\"Victorian capitalism\\" or \\"imperialism\\" or other forms of \\"cultural relativism\\" as others have done, Kohn presents straightforward biographical accounts, enhanced by summaries of the ideas of each.  He explains how a string of scholars enhanced and explained how natural selection works and why the focus remained in England.  No other single nation came close to matching this record.  It would be unreal to contend that national jealousies were not aroused by the British dominance of evolutionary thinking.  Kohn slips over this issue lightly, keeping focus on his subjects.<br /><br />Kohn selects six figures who made major contributions in expounding how adaptation provides the design framework for evolution.  The men, and they are necessarily men, as Kohn notes carefully, were \\"profoundly impressed with the power of natural selection\\".  Kohn's title is derived from their uniformity in seeing organisms as perfectly suited to their current environment.  If a trait could be identified, it must be a successful adaptation.  They understood better than anybody how nature selected organisms to survive without any interference from \\"divine intelligence\\" or any other supernatural force.  This, in the face of several of them continuing to profess faith in Christianity.  Kohn doesn't attempt to rationalise this dichotomy.  Instead he depicts each figure as he was, with strengths, interests, shortcomings and some bizarre lifestyles.<br /><br />Starting with Wallace, Kohn then moves into the 20th Century with Ronald Fisher, moves to J.B.S. Haldane, William Hamilton and John Maynard Smith and concludes with Richard Dawkins.  Although at first glance, this seems to be a string of disparate figures, Kohn shows how these men knew and interacted with each other.  Some were mentors of others, with succeeding generations adding to the wealth of insight needed to unravel the workings of Darwin's original concept.  Kohn's approach provides a comprehensive picture of the advances in thought a reading of individual biographies would be unlikely to portray.  It's interesting that none of these thinkers was a field researcher.  Even Darwin had circled the planet with his famous stop at the Galapagos Islands.  They made good use of those who relayed field observations, but their main thrust proved mathematical explanations of the evolutionary processes.<br /><br />Each of Kohn's subject is a giant in his own right.  Yet one figure standing out in this presentation, is John Maynard Smith.  Maynard Smith, who became the most expressive critic of Stephen Jay Gould, is shown as the most effective compiler of the ideas of his predecessors and contemporaries alike.  In addition, Maynard Smith is portrayed as a man anyone could hold a dialog with and not fear either a diatribe or a wandering away from the subject.  Maynard Smith once had aspirations of becoming an engineer.  Although not taking a \\"mechanistic\\" approach to natural selection, he would often ponder an idea, then decide he'd \\"better do the sums\\" to determine if it was a solid concept.  Later, as a stereotypical British academic Marxist, he worked on aircraft design and testing during WWII.  After the war, he considered various options, settling on biology.  It is well for the science that he did.  His fruit-fly studies led to demanding questions about animal behaviour - particularly in Darwin's challenging notions of mate selection.  He also readily demolished the notion of \\"group selection\\" which gained attention for a short time.  He developed the idea of \\"Evolutionarily Stable Strategy\\", which became the foundation for many students of animal behaviour.  The concept is fundamental in field observations.<br /><br />Kohn's dedication to the thinkers of science, combined with a fluid prose style makes this book an outstanding contribution.  He has read widely and interviewed those subjects available to him.  His feel for the problems these men addressed and how they resolved them is as intimate as circumstances allow.  He is forthright and non-judgemental on the eugenics issue which permeated much of British biology.  Although these men formed the ranks of Gould's \\"ultra-Darwinists\\" [a phrase this reviewer has never comprehended], Kohn shows the importance of their work to biology.  And he does it impeccably.

Sullivan isn't a biologist or student of animal behaviour.  The advantage of that is that he brought only a mild distaste to his unusual self-assignment, but few other preconceptions.  He was prepared to learn, and he did.  He didn't lose the distaste, but he learned much about the subterranean inhabitants of his city.  He also gained some new friends - people he would likely never encounter under different circumstances.  Gathered together, his subjects, their providers and pursuers - in both cases you and your neighbours - and some interesting history into a book of compelling interest.<br /><br />Studying city rats requires adapting your life to theirs.  They are nocturnal animals, so Sullivan left his wife and family at the TV while he ventured into a New York City alley.  The alley turned out to have something besides large, hungry rodents.  Sullivan dug into city records to determine why the alley is bent - giving it two names.  He learned to watch the rats with binoculars and night-vision goggles.  He must have made a fascinating sight on his little camp stool gazing into the darkness.  He didn't have to bring them treats.  The bars and restaurants in the neighbourhood were ample providers.  With a varied buffet available, the rats proved fussy eaters.  Sullivan is actually able to list preferred and disdained foods - all our garbage.<br /><br />In studying city history, Sullivan is able to provide some history of \\"pest control\\" in New York City and elsewhere.  He explains why \\"exterminator\\" is a term now out of fashion, replaced by \\"pest control\\" and other euphemisms.  \\"Extermination\\" isn't possible with rats.  Some always survive assaults on their numbers.  When the numbers drop, replacements move in with alacrity.  Numbers are an interesting issue in his account.  \\"One human, one rat\\" is a battle cry when launching campaigns to eliminate rats.  Sullivan shows how invalid that assumption is.  It isn't the numbers that are significant, so much as the rats' intelligence and adaptability.  Among their talents are the ability to gnaw through concrete and steel, and to dive down a hole no bigger than their skull.  A set of strong jaws and teeth is applied to the first ability and a flexible skeleton permits the second.<br /><br />The underlying theme is this book is more practical than simple description.  Both species of rats, the Norway and the Black, are urban residents.  They have adapted to living alongside humans who feed their gluttony with garbage.  They can never be eliminated, and the \\"pest controllers\\" can only seal off some access holes, poison a few individuals or, in extreme cases, shoot one or two.  Poisoning, which can be just as harmful to humans or pets, has limitations.  Sullivan, and some of his contacts are quite clear about the way to reduce the rat population in New York City.  Plastic garbage bags have proven a blessing for rats who can penetrate them easily.  Chucking a bag from a back door often splits them, giving the rats immediate access.  Rat control was actually better when metal trash bins were in use, but the sanitation workers objected to their weight.<br /><br />If there's a fault to this book, it's Sullivan's failure to view some other rat habitats.  Milwaukee is hardly exotic shores.  There are societies that find rats a good source of protein.  While this might not appeal to New Yorkers, it is a reality.  His subtitle, \\"the city\\", would be all-inclusive, did the cover art not give away the limitation.

150972:US	50941451	R1H5WSIPRK3UQ7	0805074422	871647100	Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Holding the line for reason	If the United States deserves credit for anything, it's for establishing the first nation that \\"did away with the theological idea of government\\".  From the outset, that nation detached divinity from any role in government.  Although the course of maintaining that ideal has been bumpy, the diversity of people in the United States has helped sustain the separation of church from state.  Until recently.  Jacoby, in this excellent summary of American secular thinking, points out that while economic opportunity attracted waves of immigrants, the unique level of religious freedom there was a major enticement.  She depicts the struggle to keep the secularist ideal paramount, and fears its erosion.<br /><br />Jacoby's account of the major figures keeping the USA secular begins with a struggle in Virginia.  In the years between independence and the establishment of the Constitution, taxing the populace to support churches arose as a serious political issue.  In Virginia, where the Anglican church was once \\"established\\", a clash between two champions of independence occurred.  Patrick Henry sought revenue for \\"teachers of the Christian religion\\", while James Madison rejected any form of tax money going to churches.  Madison, and the what would become the United States, won.  Madison's \\"Remonstrance\\", which Jacoby says should be learned by students along with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, laid the philosophical cornerstone for later legislation.<br /><br />Madison was in good company.  If his \\"Remonstrance\\" is a cornerstone, then Thomas Paine's \\"The Age of Reason\\" stands as the completed foundation for Jacoby's \\"American Freethinkers\\".  Paine's thoughts on the iniquities of religion became a theme for sustaining religious freedom, since abolishing religion would be another tyranny.  Following Paine, Thomas Jefferson is another of Jacoby's notable secularists.  The early 19th Century turned up various nonconformists, both individual and in groups.  Their numbers were swollen by immigrants fleeing various persecutions in Europe.  Among the more exotic was Ernestine  Rose, a Jewish Pole, who was a champion of atheism, women's rights and the abolition of slavery.  The figure usually singled out in discussing abolition is William Lloyd Garrison, who  considered Paine \\" monster of iniquity\\" until he read Paine's works.  Garrison had wider interests than just abolition and crusaded for much social change.<br /><br />In the post-Civil War era, the giant of American secularism was Robert Ingersoll.  A profound thinker and tireless campaigner, he was in constant demand for speeches.  Articulate and humorous when needed, he captivated audiences while challenging the established dogmas.  Ingersoll, who should be the leading exponent of \\"the congregation of the unchurched\\" in US history, has nearly faded from view.  This reviewer raised the figure of Ingersoll in a secondary school history class almost half a century ago.  The response was a cold stare.  Ingersoll read and transmitted Paine, adding no few further ideas of his own.  It is difficult to assess from Jacoby's account whether the national amnesia over Ingersoll is due as much to a victory of the religious or the replacement of his causes by others.  As Jacoby notes, much of Ingersoll's platform was taken up by the Progressive Republicans in their programme of social reform.<br /><br />Secularism in the 20th Century moved from religious matters to restraining business on the one hand and opening opportunities on the other.  Battles over education standards, and the grim spectre of race relations, not to mention Prohibition, became the focus of secularist thinkers.  The dogmas shattered during that period are beyond counting.  Jacoby's description of prison reform and the rise of the ACLU make fine reading.  She's keenly aware, however, of the threats to secular ideals today.  She notes President Bush presiding over his informal declaration of \\"war on terror\\" in a New York cathedral, something neither Woodrow Wilson nor Franklin Roosevelt felt a necessary backdrop.  There are many lessons to be learned from this excellent volume.  It's something every family should have in their library.

The one she and Grace Makutsi have now isn't a local drop-in from Gaborone or one of its surrounding communities, but a distant corporation.  There are, of course, the children Precious and Mr Matekoni have adopted, but no serious issues arise there.  Mr Matekoni's apprentices are a constant low-level irritant, but that's so constant that their shenanigans go almost unnoticed.  Except this time Mr Matekoni's own reputation may be in jeopardy.  Mma Makutsi, who has dealt with apprentice transgressions before, is put to further trials.  An attempt to broaden her social life results in a doubtful decision to attend a dancing class.  There, her high achievement in secretarial school provides no support.  She's saddled with a clumsy, inarticulate partner.<br /><br />All these events keep the ladies busy, but don't impair their general sense of satisfaction with life.  They have little to challenge them in any fundamental sense.  Except . . . except Mma Ramotswe's new husband is not her first.  Deep in her past there was another and the situation was far from marital bliss.  That past reaches out to grasp her again.  This time it's in ways totally unexpected - as one might expect from McCall Smith - and the impending result relegates this book's title to heavy irony.  Twist and evade as she attempts to do, Precious Ramotswe seems inextricably caught in a web of enduring grief.  Will she ever be \\"cheerful\\" again?<br /><br />McCall Smith may have reached a peak with this book.  It's difficult to see how he could intensify the contrasts he introduces in this volume.  Mr Matekoni's strengths, after a bout with depression in an earlier volume, are growing, but slowly.  For all his humility and goodness, it's Precious who is the foundation of this team.  The challenges she faces in this book bind them closer, but don't shift the structure of power.  What greater hazards could the author subject them to?  Such questions only underestimate the powers of an amazing writer.  McCall Smith continues to please and perplex, confound and charm his readers.  Those readers should grow in number as more learn of his talents.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]nextricably caught in a web of enduring grief.

It must have been a capricious sprite that convinced Series Editor Tim Folger to select Steven Pinker to choose the essays in this collection.  In any collection of science and nature writings there will be some of wide, even intense interest, while others may appeal to a limited few with special interests.  This anthology is no exception.  While the majority of them are good [best!] articles over a range of topics, Pinker added a few \\"ringers\\".  These latter certainly lighten the mood of the set even while imparting compelling information on their own.  Perhaps surprisingly, some of these deal with the vague field of \\"demographics\\".<br /><br />\\"Hard\\" science in this collection is covered by an article on diabetes, one on \\"the stuff of genes\\" and an introduction to octopus life.  Another element of life is the role of parasites on behaviour.  Carl Zimmer's \\"Parasite Rex\\", an excellent introduction to this topic, is furthered here by neurologist Robert Sapolsky.  Cosmology isn't ignored, with Max Tegmark suggesting you glance over your shoulder to learn whether a duplicate of you isn't reading the same article in a parallel universe.  Public health may not be a hard science, but it must firmly rest on top research to be effective.  Atal Gawande's brief history of the career of Dr Francis Moore is enlightening and provocative - as was Moore.<br /><br />How the public views research and its implications is a topic of increasing importance.  Daniel C. Dennett's explanation of why the notion of \\"genetic determinism\\" must be shelved is essential reading.  Gregg Easterbrook's \\"We're All Gonna Die!\\" deals with perceived threats to society and life.  Unsuccessfully challenged by a recent book, Easterbrook's article lists scenarios that could lead to disastrous consequences if not approached wisely.  Will an asteroid do for us as it did to the dinosaurs?  What if a particle accelerator created a \\"strangelet\\" that might gobble the planet - or the entire universe?  The Earth's magnetic field has reversed itself many times over the past many millions of years.  What will be the result on human society when it flips again - beyond making all our compasses point the \\"wrong way\\"?  And what can, or should, we do about it?<br /><br />While you're worrying about these threats, take a moment to consider Peggy Orenstein's plight.  Like any expectant mother, she's pondering a name for her new baby.  Delving into the [USA's] Social Security Administration's database, she's spent hours tracking the history of names.  \\"Melanies\\" have come and gone in popularity, as have \\"Aidans\\" and \\"Hannahs\\".  \\"Michael\\" remains a standby for boys, but Peggy's expecting a girl and the subject lapses.  If you would rather go outdoors than spend time searching names, take note of your avian neighbours.  Mike O'Connor does.  He has to, he runs a birdseed store and a Web site answering questions about human-bird relationships.  Should you throw rice at weddings?  Perhaps not, if the birds eat it and swell up.  Is a hair-dryer the chosen method for freezing a heron caught in a pond's early-winter ice?  How does the chickadee stand in popularity?  O'Connor handles these questions with hilarious finesse.<br /><br />It seems no North American science writing can reach the public without dealing with the Christian movement to invade the public schools.  This book opens with that essential topic.  Folger addresses the growing threat to both education and support for science in his Forward.  Clearly this insidious movement impacts how science is viewed and Folger hopes volumes such as this one will help bastion education and interest in science among the young.

Are we so intelligent and adaptive that we can overcome whatever the environment throws at us?  Can we adjust to the looming global warming through the use of technology?  Couper-Johnston contends that history records almost universal inability to cope with sudden and intense weather events.  In this in-depth study, he chronicles sudden changes in wind and rainfall and how humanity  coped with the result.  Even when it was known that some extremes were to be expected in certain areas, human planning proved woefully inadequate.  Devastated crops, intense drought, flash floods, and episodes of human suffering have all resulted from quirks in weather patterns.  The driving force behind these anomalies lies in the Western Pacific.<br /><br />Under \\"normal\\" conditions, the wind and current pattern moves westward across the Central Pacific.  The \\"Equatorial Trade Winds\\" and their associated movement of sea water, drove the Kon Tiki across the Pacific in under a hundred days.  Uninterrupted, the current draws a wealth of sea and bird life to the west coast of South America.  The force is strong enough to pile water in the New Guinea area up to 60 cm above the level off Peru.  If that pattern changes and the westward winds and currents are interrupted, savage storms lash South America while India, China and Malaysia suffer drought.  The stream of effects continues with varying impact over all tropical areas.<br /><br />The tropics are not alone in suffering from the change.  Known as El Nino, for its frequency of Christmas-time appearances in the Eastern Pacific, this reversed weather pattern has been felt in Pharonic Egypt and North America.  Couper-Johnston traces the growth of knowledge of El Nino and the attempts to forecast its appearance and impact.  From a basic description of the mechanics of El Nino, he goes on to give a chronology of the events and their impact on human societies.  Although there have been several books recently published on the phenomenon, Couper-Johnston's is by far the most comprehensive.

The new religion, based on \\"humanism\\" is called \\"progress\\".  This faith rests on the notion that the human condition can be constantly and continuously improved - forever.  Instead of a metaphysical paradise, the new religion proposes one that can be achieved here and now.  We act, he says, in the false belief that \\"science\\" is the new divinity.  With so many problems having been solved through the application of science and technology, we've come to believe ALL obstacles can be overcome.  What this faith ignores, Gray warns, is the finite supply of resources our planet has to sustain this programme.<br /><br />In this collection of thought-provoking essays, Gray closely and critically scrutinises the new \\"faith\\" and explains its manifestations.  In a trinity of themes, he looks at \\"progress\\", \\"terrorism\\" and \\"politics\\".  The \\"scare quotes\\" are necessary here, because the reader may discover wholly new definitions of these terms within these pages.  With incisive wit and deep insight, he examines the dedication to \\"progress\\" - where it came from and what it means now.  A careful observer, he explains that \\"progress\\" is meaningful in the process of science.  In the hands of politicians, industry and modern education, it is but a superstition.  The world, he says, is \\"suffering from disseminated primatemaia - a plague of people.\\"  In his view \\"Homo sapiens\\" has evolved into \\"Homo rapiens\\", stripping the planet of resources with little idea of the impact it's having.  The plague must be curtailed like any other infection.  The first step in that therapy is shedding the belief that resources are limitless and technology can replace shortfalls.<br /><br />He is scornful of the \\"war on terror\\", knowing that clumsy thinking followed by clumsy action easily creates more terrorists than it eliminates.  The \\"crusade\\" now under way is simply generating fresh enemies.  These antagonists are perhaps even more dedicated to destruction than those who launched the World Trade Center attacks.  In \\"Washington's New Jacobins\\", Gray demonstrates the fallacies of using authority and military power to impart ideologies.  It wasn't successful in the French or Communist revolutions, so there's little reason for thinking it will be accomplished by the Anglo-American Axis.  The evangelists of the new faith are the neo-cons in Washington and their acolytes on Downing Street .  \\"Dr Billy Graham has joined forces with Dr Strangelove\\", forging a bizarre and dangerous alliance.<br /><br />As a heretic against the new orthodoxy, Gray seems to be standing alone.  Heretics can be destructive, but they can also provide constructive pointers.  Gray's approach isn't a hysterical rant - he's too knowledgeable for that.  Instead of grand, sweeping and futile gestures such as Afghanistan and Iraq, Gray seeks a gradualist approach to issues.  His method requires scrutiny and understanding of the underlying conditions of any issue.  The approach requires work and people to perform the tasks.

162063:US	50941451	R17TABPRMP6VA	0465092551	564798045	The World Of Biblical Literature	Books	5	8	9	N	N	A convocation and a castigation	There are few voices in the arena of biblical studies who command the respect due Robert Alter.  After a long career in biblical scholarship, he recently issued a new translation of the Hebrew Bible to wide acclaim.  This little book is, in several ways, a precursor to that momentous effort.  Viewing the Hebrew Bible as a literary effort, instead of a legal or evangelical one, was gaining wide acceptance when this book was published.  \\"The World\\" here is the collection of academic views expressed over the previous two decades.  Alter  reviews the efforts of previous scholars in addressing literary forms present in the bible and what those might indicate about the ancient authors.  Essentially an extended bibliographic essay, this book is an excellent starting point for understanding the secular view of the Bible.<br /><br />Reading any of the multitude of bibles as literature isn't a common approach.  Yet, the ongoing success of the Bible must lie in part to its authors' narrative talents.  Alter opens his survey with a mild chastisement of critics who have viewed the biblical tales in piecemeal.  He voices regret that literary \\"reductionism\\" has obscured the larger picture.  While he acknowledges the religious import of biblical narratives, he wants more recognition of the literary aspects than these stories have been given.  The \\"Literary Play\\" in the second chapter's title conveys the tone admirably.  As his concluding chapter notes, failure to understand the literary structures and illustrations of biblical stories reflects failure to understand much of Western European literature in general.<br /><br />In one sense, this book is a challenge to other scholars, both past and future.  Alters poses questions he feels need addressing, and when material is available, explains how others have responded.  He gives the interpretations and conclusions of other scholars clearly and succinctly.  Nothing appears out of context nor adjusted to an improbable world view.  Alter is keen to show where literary analysis of the Hebrew Bible stands, where gains have been made and where greater attention should be given.  His view is balanced and his analyses thorough.<br /><br />Although he makes his preferences clear without engaging in summary judgments, Alter's devastating dismemberment of Harold Bloom's infamous analysis is worthy of a close look.  When text analysts - the \\"document\\" school - revealed that the Hebrew Bible was penned by no fewer than four authors plus a \\"Redactor\\", some scholars struggled to give an identity to them.  Harold Bloom, leaping on the postmodernist bandwagon, came to the conclusion that one of major biblical authors, of \\"The Book Of J\\" was actually a woman.  That this thesis was lustily applauded by his American feminist audience obscured the poor translations Bloom had done.  Alter gently, but firmly, examines Bloom's thesis and effectively bins much of it.  In some ways, it's the highlight of the book, although Alter never loses his academic detachment in dealing with this bizarre proposal.<br /><br />As an academic survey, Alter's text is clearly presented and a comfortable read.  Biblical scholars may, as in any field, quibble with particular details.  That's welcome, since evoking such comment is precisely Alter's purpose in producing it.  What is does best is in posing the issues and how scholars have dealt with them so far.  Try this for an enjoyable entry into the world of biblical literature.

162766:US	50941451	R2BY9U4HN543WQ	1400040957	821374449	Istanbul: Memories and the City	Books	4	10	18	N	N	Gloom, melancholy and sadness	An author's account of his or her life is always of consuming interest.  A prize-winning author is even more compelling.  When an author cops the IMPAC Prize, the reader is almost driven to learn the background and motivations of the novelist.  Pamuk's account of his early life is one of the more bizarre examples of the memoir genre.  His entire life has been intimately tied to the city.  The link is so strong he contends his views are typical of the entire population.  The detailed events may differ, of course, but he claims to speak for them all.<br /><br />Pamuk's life, he says, has been dominated by \\"another Orhan\\".  First perceived as a child, this \\"doppelganger\\" possesses some elusive qualities the author seeks for himself.  Definition of these qualities eludes us, but the reader is left the impression that they are more positive than the author's own.  Almost anything would fit that qualification.  If there is a more morose and defeated character than Orhan Pamuk in today's Istanbul, he would be difficult to find.  In Pamuk's account of his young life in this city, the word \\"melancholy\\" occurs times beyond counting.  He even devotes an entire chapter to the Turkish word for it - \\"huzun\\".<br /><br />His despondency is due to numerous conflicts.  He devotes a chapter to fights with his brother.  The estrangement of his parents are a continuous theme of his account.  His father, having wasted the family's inheritance, is often away.  Pamuk only reveals where almost at the end of the book.  An expedition with his mother culminates in a remote apartment in the city.  There, he discovers his father's clothes and a stack of books duplicating the one at home.  Beyond these local tribulations are ship collisions in the harbour or in the Straits which the family ventures forth at any time to witness.  More enduring are the losses by fire of many buildings, most significantly the palatial villas lining the Dardanelles.  These were an attempt to restore some of the grandeur of the Ottoman Empire.  Their loss is keenly felt by Pamuk - although he'd never moved in that level of society.<br /><br />Adding to Pamuk's gloomy text is his photographic collection used to enhance the feeling.  Everything is monochrome - faces, streets, buildings even the Straits.  Smoking ship funnels add to the despondency of the city - and of the author.  Even snow, with its capacity to enliven an urban or rural scene anywhere else, here displays as merely another shade of grey.  One mourns that Pamuk wrote so much, since the photos, in larger scale, would be a significant collection of urban images.  Placing them in such reduced displays diminishes both the city and its people.  Pamuk, even as a child if the photographs of him are indicative, may be in an abyss of despair.  Others in the city may actually smile.  In a couple of the shots, his mother makes at least a weak attempt.<br /><br />The final conflict is that of Turkish nationalism rending the Ottoman Empire.  It permeates Pamuk's text, with nearly every ill suffered by the city or himself somehow tracked back to that amorphous amalgamation of peoples.  Why the loss of empire a century ago should dominate the thinking of an entire city, perhaps an entire nation after so long, remains unclear.  While Pamuk's lament is continuous and unflagging, it's difficult to see where he thinks solace lies.  What is the value of harking back to such a questionable past?  Would he restore tyrannical sultans or quell rebellious provinces with mass slaughters?  Would he abandon a nominally democratic society for one in which the mass of the population was constrained by medieval rigidity?  Why would a restoration make him content?  There's little hint of just what would lift him and his city from these doldrums.<br /><br />The memoir is restricted almost entirely to Pamuk's childhood.  Years of school, including architecture and painting are skimmed over superficially, other than as means of further voicing his discontent with life.  While this book may provide background for Pamuk's style, his motivation to write is contained in but one sentence.  Is this reviewer impelled to grasp a Pamuk novel, eager to see how this morose personality is expressed in the characters he creates?  Only if suitably fortified.

169222:US	50941451	R2JQSDGH6ARH4U	0789480506	916654927	God: A Brief History	Books	3	5	9	N	N	Wrong title, wrong theme, wrong evidence	The monotheists, finally compelled to curtail their militant approach to conversion, have turned to new methods.  Some of these are almost intellectual.  Bowker's approach is deft.  He simply lists as many gods as he can find evidence for, then insists they are simply expressions of the one he favours.  That's \\"God\\", of course - the enduring monotheist [and in this case, decidedly \\"Christian\\"] version of one of the thousands of deities humanity has invented over the centuries.  There are, of course, creative deities, vicious deities, loving deities and hosts of those with specialised roles.  Bowker's theme isn't new.  Unlike some of his fellows using this approach, he simply ignores the \\"personality\\" disparities among the gods.  There's only the one, he assumes, then goes on to list - and lavishly illustrate - personifications that carry cognomens that at least provide some identity.<br /><br />Bowker lines up his gods in a grand geographical and chronological sequence.  There are Indian gods, Chinese and Japanese spiritual beings and any others he can adduce.  The \\"pagan\\" sprites are ignored, presumably since they didn't generate sophisticated artistic representation to warrant inclusion.  Shamans in the Amazon could set him straight on this, but it's hard to see Bowker tramping the rain forest to garner \\"uncivilized\\" insights.  All those peoples [and their deities] he catalogues, presenting brief histories and pictorial examples.  In the end, in each case, however, they are all boiled down to his single deity.  Olympian jealousies, forces contending for human support, power struggles on Earth and in the skies become no more than way stations in the realisation that all nothing more than temporary manifestations of this deity's struggle for identity.  Various personality quirks expressed by these gods don't give them individuality.  There's only the one, devising various methods to control human thinking.  And keep them in fear.<br /><br />Monotheism, as its name implies, is quite simple.  Devising a single deity allows the commentator to attribute anything and everything to it.  Change, exotic departures from a norm of behaviour or manifestation are simply evidence of the one god's power and desire to cover all the bases.  It doesn't occur to Bowker that there can be many gods, all invented by the varieties of humans on the planet.  Even his one god took generations to find its footing through the writings of many people.  Other gods had to be cast aside in order to grant this one all the necessary powers and attributes it now claims.  Such a simple idea has, of course, wide appeal.  So long as only the one is given to a populace to accept, its strength grows without hindrance.  Questioning any aspect of that existence renders the entire concept vulnerable.<br /><br />Bowker meets the issue of questioners in stalwart fashion.  He cannot deny that there are those who find flaws in the tangled ideas of monotheism.  He must give them a voice.  He then reduces that voice to a whisper.  Where earlier adherents to the god saw its evidence in Nature, the new questioners declared these natural characteristics explainable.  There's no \\"divinity\\" in the tides, in migrating birds or the violence of thunderstorms.  So be it, says Bowker, and moves his deity out of the material realm.  The god is displaced to some ethereal state in which it is no longer part of the physical world.  It's \\"not an object\\", he says, it is \\"the One\\".  By replacing one capital letter with another, Bowker thinks he's brought the idea up to date.  In reality, he's only substituted one dogma with another, even less tangible one.  This is a beautiful book to look at, but reading it can only lead to depression.  Bowker's theme is artificial, his reasoning can only be labelled specious and his capacity for poor logic almost limitless.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]me implies, is quite simple.

From that one cell come trillions, grouped into special functions and producing everything from wings to webbed feet.  How can such variation derive from a single fertilised egg?  More importantly, in Carroll's view, how can creatures with a similar number of working genes, such as mice and humans, be so different?  This highly readable overview of how embryos develop into adult bodies explores the mechanics of the process in exquisite and illuminating detail.<br /><br />The amount of media attention given DNA has often led us to assume direct links can be made between \\"a gene\\" and parts of the organism.  Carroll sets straight this misleading image.  Everything that goes into building a body, from butterfly wings to a zebra's stripes, relies on a sequence of events.  The sequence begins with what he dubs the \\"Tool Kit\\" of development.  Basic to all animal life are the HOX genes which control which parts are front/back, top/bottom and inside/outside.  Other tools build limbs, regulate processes, arrange for hair, scales or feathers as required.  Once the basic organisation is made, the development process uses a string of \\"switches\\" to fine-tune the body's appearance and operations.  The switches are the key to many aspects of the body.  Failure to work, turning something \\"on\\" or \\"off\\" at the wrong time, sending erroneous  signals - may result in mutation or loss of the organism.  It is a process that has been under way for millions of years, adding or removing features under environmental pressures.<br /><br />The author selects a small variety of examples to illustrate how the mechanism works.  A favoured subject is butterflies, which come in a rich array of wing shape and decoration.  Some even change with shifts in climate as the wrong colouration renders them vulnerable to predators.  Another example is zebras, which were scorned by President Theodore Roosevelt who found the idea of \\"protective colouration\\" sadly lacking.  Roosevelt, of course, hunted during the day while the natural predators of zebras seek them at dawn or dusk, when they are nearly invisible.  How did zebras achieve their camouflage?  Millions of years of switches guiding hair patterns.  Even the tall, lanky giraffe, Carroll notes, can blend in with the background with subtle ease.<br /><br />The study of organic forms, \\"morphology\\", focusses on \\"snapshots\\" of current or past observation of evidence.  An offshoot of morphology, known as \\"cladistics\\" is more flexible, but still relies on fixed images.  Carroll demonstrates that this approach must be replaced by a more dynamic one.  His focus on embryos as the starting point has led him to grant the name Evolutionary Development, or \\"EvoDevo\\" to what is an exciting new science.  \\"EvoDevo\\" in Carroll's hands is more than an explanation of why we see what we do in today's animal species.  It's also a new form for examining life in the ancient past and tracing how change likely took place.  Knowing that natural selection builds on what's available, Carroll's analytical techniques show how animals shifted from a radial structure to a bilateral one.  That's why you have two arms and legs instead of five arms like a starfish.  Bilateralism proved more efficient and came to dominate animal structures.<br /><br />Carroll's prose too frequently lapses into a \\"cracker-barrel\\" style in his effort to reach a wide audience.  However, he enhances his fine text with many illustrations and photographs.  Evolutionary \\"trees\\", limb structure and how the switches operate are all well depicted.  Some stunning views of butterfly wing markings are provided to illustrate the variations.  Carroll's bibliography is limited, but the nascent level of the science justifies that. What is puzzling about this book is Carroll's treatment of leading figures in evolutionary biology.  His iconoclasm reflects the influence of Stephen J. Gould on Carroll's writing.  He cites Gould as a distant mentor, which seems anomalous in view of the material.  Gould vilified \\"reductionism\\" but Carroll's explanation of tool box and switches is the most reductionist view of life around.  It may not be limited to \\"one gene - one protein\\", but the depiction shows how life relies on a highly limited set of conditions in order to succeed.  Gould's stance against the adaptationist programme is rendered untenable given how Carroll's switches must be suitable for particular environments.

Posner, a judge, wants lawyers to sit in judgement of which research should go forward and which curtailed.  He has lined up a string of threats we face in terms of \\"catastrophic\\" loss of human life.  There are bolides cruising in space eager to smash into our planet and repeat on us what one did to the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.  Physicists tinkering with subatomic particles could trigger a reaction that would shrink the Earth to a sphere 100 metres across.  \\"Bioterrorism\\" is the next thrust from \\"America's\\" off-shore enemies.  What to do to counter this litany of disasters?  He insists we need a policy to address each of them.<br /><br />Posner analyses the various challenges to continued human existence.  For each threat there is a \\"risk assessment\\" examining the probabilities of its occurring.  From the assessment, there is a \\"cost-benefit\\" calculation to determine how much to spend to prevent the catastrophe.  How likely is the impact of another asteroid extinguishing much or all of human life? How much need we spend to deflect it?  What is the true cost of the Kyoto protocol?  Posner puts dollar values on each of these in terms of likelihood of the event transpiring and the cost of countering it.<br /><br />Significantly, Posner posits the threats and their solutions to his countrymen.  These are \\"American\\" problems and must be dealt with in an \\"American\\" environment.  He patronisingly grants some UN agency involvement on a few issues, but these are limited to areas the UN is already dealing with or ones the USA has disdained.  The British pre-emption of interest in rogue asteroid is given a nod, then passed over.  Keeping the focus on what the USA must do in countering, Posner ignores the element of his society that must accept or reject these numbers and the costs involved.  Even the most clumsy (clumsiest) estimate of cost per taxpayer would have given this analysis some basis in reality.  Posner, however, must suspect that the figure would likely be too high for taxpayers to cope with.  He concedes the point in his claim that the costs of adhering to Kyoto would be disproportionately high for his countrymen.<br /><br />There are so many inconsistencies and self-contradictions in this book they defy listing here.  He condemns the Kyoto Protocol as too restrictive on one hand and costing the USA too much on the other.  He ignores the fact that this Protocol is a beginning, not an end.  He also bypasses the reality of his own country being the world's biggest consumer of resources and exporter of greenhouse gases.  He condemns foreign students who return to home countries and urges strengthening of restrictions on what they're allowed to study.  This in the face of his braggadocio about the high levels of American science and education.  That these departing foreign students are taking expertise to solve problems in their own lands seems to have eluded him.  He rants about keeping foreign students away from \\"lethal toxins\\" and ignores the number of these that occur naturally and cause death or disfigurement in humans and livestock - even in the technologically superior USA.  How many \\"enemies\\" would be generated by the constraints he proposes?  Finally, how he expects lawyers to gain enough expertise in science to sit in judgement of which research should go forward in a nation unable to come to grips with natural selection remains an enigma.  It's commendable that Posner raises the list of threats the entire planet faces.  His chauvinist solutions bear little relation to the reality of today's world.

Teppic doesn't wear a crown, but there's plenty else.  Besides all the gear he took up while training to be an Assassin in Ankh-Morpork, there's The Reaping Hook of Justice, The Sheaf of Plenty and The Three-pronged Spear of the Waters of the Earth.  Oh, yes, there's also a gold mask for identity.  All this has been imposed on Teppic since ascending the throne of Djelibeybi at the death of his father.  Along with the paraphernalia, Teppic has also inherited a staggering, if unspecified, debt load.  In Djelibeybi, each monarch is to \\"rest\\" in a pyramid, each one larger than that of his/her predecessor.  With seven millennia of monarchs, the shores of the River Djel are occupied with these man-made stone mountains.  And nobody can remember how long it's been since any of them was paid for.<br /><br />Teppic, having breathed the foetid air of Anhk-Morpork, misses feather mattresses and plumbing.  He is also suspicious of the type of \\"justice\\" prevailing in Djelibeybi.  Long centuries of \\"tradition\\" have conditioned the populace to endure bizarre forms of justice.  So conditioned that they will self-inflict punishment, no matter how illogical.  Teppic has difficulty understanding this, but Dios, his high priest is there to counsel him on how the system works.  There's also another voice, just at the level of perception, adding to Teppic's uncertainty.  Urged by Dios to build the greatest pyramid ever to honour Teppic's departed father, the new king has reservations. Something is telling him it's a bad idea.<br /><br />The bad idea proves worse than he can imagine.  The ranks of pyramids contain the fourth dimension, Time, which can distort the other three if enough accumulates.  Events transpire, not the least of which is the disappearance of Djelibeybi, river, pyramids and all.  This situation allows Pratchett to make his first drastic departure from the image of \\"humourous fantasist\\" pinned on him by uncomprehending critics.  He does so with gusto.  Employing the assistance of the Discworld's greatest mathematician [not a dolphin!], Pratchett guides us through the world of quantum physics.  Far from fantasy, this is serious science brought to life by the one writer who can accomplish it with such finesse.  Who but Pratchett could utilise the metaphor of Djelibeybi stretching like \\"a lead ball on a rubber sheet\\" in such a context?<br /><br />What happens when Time distorts the other dimensions?  If you're outside, how do you return?  If you're inside, what effect will the transformation of those dimensions mean to reality?  What will be reality?  Pratchett answers those questions in ways that will astound fans of fantasy and confound physics professors who seek ways of awakening their legions of drowsy students.  He formulates a new reality in which those things we believe in but never see are given substance.  Will we still believe in them when they confront us?  How will we cope with the forces they possess?  Pratchett poses these questions to prod us into considering them for ourselves.

Paleontologist Steven Mithen utilises a favourite technique of SciFi - time travel - to explain how our ancestors once lived. Although this might be a risky method in the hands of someone less talented, Mithen carries it well as he takes us on a global journey. From Western, Southern and Eastern Asia, through Africa, Europe and the Americas and Australia, he introduces us to the daily activities of those people who moved across the planet as the glaciers retreated. While that sounds highly speculative, Mithen's method is a way of introducing us to the numerous dig sites prehistoric scholars have found and analysed. The evidence for his depictions is laid out and the interpretations arising from the data is carefully presented.<br /><br />Mithen isn't our guide in this tour. He assigns that task to a figure named for a contemporary of Charles Darwin. \\"Victorian John Lubbock\\", as Mithen dubs him, wrote one of the earliest paleoanthropological works, \\"Prehistoric Times\\" - an attempt to describe what our ancestors were like. Lubbock coined the terms \\"Palaeolithic\\" and \\"Neolithic\\" to give order to a chaotic scene. In this account, the Time Traveller refers to his namesake's publication for comparison of what has been revealed today by Mithen's digging colleagues. What did your ancestors do during the day? What challenges did they face and how did they overcome them? Time Traveller Lubbock tries to impart these questions and their answers with distant observation and active participation alike. The method, when the releaved evidence is explained, proves an excellent balance. You are there at the time of events and alongside the archaeologists as they sift through artefacts thousands of years old.<br /><br />Human prehistory is probably science's most contentious field. For years, the story of how and when the Western Hemisphere was populated has been a simmering issue. Mithen, although giving passing attention to the \\"Clovis debate\\" and other questions relating to the human invasion of the America's, gently disentangles himself from the specifics. Instead, he focusses on how the environment affected the way in which societies formed here. This isn't just an evasion tactic. Mithen is more concerned with how humanity solved various problems facing them as they settled in uncontested lands. What adds to our interest is the comparison of such elements as the domesticating grains and animals here with that of Western Asian populations. Mithen meticulously describes how the genetic patterns of grains and animals alike were changed by human intervention.<br /><br />It's easy to admit to a sense of wonder at reading this book. The scope is vast, fifteen thousand years of time and the entire globe. That one author could accomplish this feat is at least admirable, if not astonishing. Yet, Mithen's own sense of awe is clearly evident, if not infectious. He's not a classroom-bound academic and some of his own site visits are incorporated into the narrative. His passion for the science is clear and present - something that should prompt younger readers to emulate. The recent dates given for dig sites plainly indicate that real work remains to be done. And speed is critical - the number of sites discovered and worked under the threat of dam, highway and shopping mall building is too depressing to recount here. If you, or anyone you know is looking for a career in science, buy this book, read it and encourage a career in human prehistory. Mithen shows how rewarding it can be.

A surge of interest in the evolutionary basis for religion has resulted in some fine works.  Few, however, approach the careful analysis and depth of insight offered by Atran's excellent book.  Asking the question, \\"Why do humans put so many resources into a counterintuitive supernatural world?\\", he responds that the answers fall easily into an evolutionary framework.  He goes on to explain, in ten easy steps[!] how this circumstance has come about.  The core of the presentation is what practices we follow are derived from normal, everyday behaviour traits.  These traits are human cognitive ones, which makes their biological roots distant but traceable.  The human mind, derived from the sudden expansion of cognitive abilities about fifty thousand years ago, put us in a unique position in the animal kingdom.  Religion is the price we pay for being \\"special\\".<br /><br />The \\"ten easy steps\\" are not.  The astute reader may jump to the Conclusion for an outline of Atran's thesis.  There he explains that religion is not an \\"entity\\", even though we publicly commit resources to it.  Since it's not an entity, religion itself cannot be an evolutionary adaptation.  However, it does fit into an \\"evolutionary landscape\\".  That landscape he describes in a metaphor of hills and valleys, with certain behaviours following the path of least resistance.  The supernatural, Atran contends, arises from a \\"cultural manipulation\\" of habits derived from the Pleistocene - fear of predators, death and the quest for nourishment.  Since humans live in groups, the interactions of individuals within the group reinforces these habits.  When natural phenomena are transformed into the supernatural conformity results.  Once completing the outline, readers will find enlightening and reasoned arguments supporting the thesis that the foundations for religious behaviour have well-established roots.<br /><br />Atran discusses the distinction between pathological and mystical mental states.  While these are useful, his analysis of the sociobiological and \\"group selection\\" theses make truly compelling reading.  Sociobiology has sought the roots of many human behaviour traits in the actions of other creatures.  While that works for some behaviours, Atran sees no justification for applying it to religion.  Religion is too human specific, he argues.  Nor, he contends, does the notion that \\"group selection\\" - which claims religion is a \\"superorganism\\" - has any basis.  He further dismisses the notion that \\"memes\\" - a form of replicable and transmitted idea, cannot account for the persistence of religious ideas.  Memes, he finds, require a fidelity of transmission that isn't reflected in reality.  Religion, being highly variable across many environments, isn't supportive of such rigid definition.<br /><br />As a final topic, Atran addresses the dichotomy between religion and science.  The underlying distinction between these two social forces is that science recognises that humans are incidental elements in the universe, while religion places them at the centre.  Religion fares poorly in knowledge, while science lacks a strong moral element.  It's a fitting conclusion to a book closely examining how science has addressed the phenomenon of human belief in the supernatural.<br /><br />Although Atran's prose style is a bit stiff, the information he conveys is too significant and well thought out to make that objection important.  His command of the sources is indicated in the bibliography and carefully shown as presented in the text.  He acknowledges in his first note that Pascal Boyer's \\"Religion Explained\\" was published as this book was going to press.  Any student of causes for human religion will need to carefully study both books.  They are a major contributions in understanding why humans engage in such seemingly bizarre practices as religion.

Anyone can make up a set of rules.  There need be no logic nor reason to the instructions.  So long as players can be found, the actual list doesn't matter.  Once the players are committed to play, however, adherence to the instructions becomes obligatory.  Wittstock has found a set of rules.  He wants the faithful to adhere to them scrupulously.  Here, he proclaims his list, prefaced by a litany of whingeing about why American society should play his game.  He finds his society deeply flawed and offers a prescription for these blemishes.  Using selected citations from a man whose origins and \\"sayings\\" remain in dispute, Wittstock offers a therapy for a people apparently clamouring for direction.  The game is to remove the complexities of life and provide simplistic solutions.  The ante to this game is willing, but utter submission.  Wittstock is on a moral crusade and there's no room for dissent or even questioning of his formula.<br /><br />Passing over the issue of whether the Master and Commander of Christianity actually existed, let alone made these pronouncements, Wittstock insists the \\"commands\\" are approved by a string of committees.  That these committees deliberated nearly four centuries after the events appears irrelevant.  From his citations it appears that Wittstock sequestered himself away in some retreat for a long time to pen this book.  He ignores the biblical scholarship that's taken place during the past generation - indeed, the past century.  He contends that the Gospel writers impart what they saw or heard their subject doing in his travels and teachings.  Seemingly unaware that they weren't born yet, he also ignores the fact that three of them relied on the cobbled-together text of the first writer.  His sources are not only faulty, his other \\"supportive\\" material is little more than antique commentators whose writing was uncritically based on the same material.  Except for some scattered references in his introductory chapters, there's not a whiff of scholarship in this book.  The \\"commands\\" are derived solely from Wittstock's analysis.  Worse yet, the \\"analyses\\" and commentary he offers with the 125 \\"commands\\" are his entirely.  No view of other theologians is presented to buttress his interpretations.  Where are Schweitzer, Kloppenborg, Johnathon Z. Smith, Thompson and others who've examined these texts and concluded their source is ephemeral?<br /><br />For expressions of purportedly loving deity, Wittstock's list is pretty stern stuff.  They aren't guidelines or suggestions for improving life, they are commands.  Would we all be better people from following them?  In particular would Americans, his target audience, improve their society by following these dicta?  The indicators aren't good.  Divorce, a favourite target of Wittstock's, is unlikely to be replaced by adherence to these strictures.  A more likely scenario would be greater violence and acrimony.  Like all propaganda, this book is simplistic and deceptive, readily believed by the credulous or confused.  Worse than simply misleading and misdirected, this book is potentially dangerous.  Turned into policy or inserted into an already fragile education system, its dogmas are the sort of foundation for repression we've experienced during the last century.  We don't need more of that.  Since condemning books isn't this reviewer's style, the writer can only recommend shunning it.  Since there's little new or inspiring in it, you will suffer little by doing so.

Among physicists there is a theory about multiple universes.  Each time a decision is made or an action taken, a new universe is created.  If a butterfly stomps its left front foot, a new universe with a different sequence of history forms.  Stomp the right foot and yet another arises.  If, as in Ray Bradbury's famous \\"The Sound of Thunder\\", a butterfly was stepped on millions of years ago, how different might our present be?  The sequence of events in each scenario may alter only slightly - or be wildly divergent.  This idea underlies the theme of the third Discworld science book conceived by Terry Pratchett and his colleagues.<br /><br />Since this is the first \\"Science of Discworld\\" released in the USA, some background is essential.  Using a surplus of magic, Hex, the Discworld's version of Deep Thought, has created an new universe.  Tucked away in that creation is a Roundworld - the one we live on.  There is neither magic nor the binding force of the Discworld cosmos, \\"narrativium\\" here.  Stories cannot be fathomed until they end.  There is no logical sequence on which to build events.  \\"Random\\" is the key word.  The result is that Roundworld has evolved many lifeforms, nearly all of which have be killed off by massive ice sheets, poisonous gases or huge stones from space.  Only one thing can save Roundworld's humanity from its own extinction event.  Charles Darwin must sit down and write \\"The Origin of Species\\" to make humans understand how life here works.  The knowledge will allow them to escape.<br /><br />The Discworld's wizards have a portal to Roundworld.  They also have a sense of mission.  Once, they tried to change Roundworld's destiny - it was a near disaster.  This time they don't wish to interfere, but Hex advises them that the odds of Darwin writing the correct book are not only bad, but getting worse.  Again, guidance of events is called for, but selecting which  key events to change becomes an insurmountable problem.<br /><br />In explaining the flow of time and how possible varients of that flow can affect history, the authors take you through the latest thinking on these topics.  Discworld fans may be taken a bit aback by the level of theory encountered here.  Never fear.

" **	Literature, it's said, holds up a mirror to life.  If our image of life is flawed or blurry the reflection will be hardly better.  We are only now beginning to understand how life, especially human life, actually works.  The Barashes, drawing on literature and the new science of evolutionary psychology, demonstrate that much of literature may be explained by biology.  Instead of literature depicting limited or skewed views of morality or other ephemeral concepts, it can use universals applicable to all humanity.  And that means the most enduring literature, no matter unconscious the author might be of Darwin's natural selection, still rests on evolutionary foundations.<br /><br />The authors, a father-daughter team, have scoured a wide range of literature, from Shakespeare through Tolstoy to Mark Twain, in demonstrating which human characteristics are best portrayed in fiction or drama.  They are quick to insist that biology is not \\"the\\" tool for analysing writing, but is \\"a\\" tool.  One which should be used more often and given more attention than it has.  They show how Othello, a play whose characters have been adapted to endless variations, is at heart, about male jealousy.  Nature teems with examples of manifestations of this basic trait, from the physical to the behavioural.  Scientific publications present countless examples from insects to elephants.<br /><br />The chapter \\"The Key to Jane Austen's Heart\\" is about \\"what women want,\\" and why.  There's far more involved than Helen Hunt's ambition to be a successful manager or Freud's lack of answering his own question.  The situation rests on finding the right mate.  Like male jealousy, females of the species have a strong vested interest in what kind of male they select.  Unlike males, females of many species, especially we primates, make a heavy investment in the reproductive process.  For human females, there's the long gestation period, need for assistance during upbringing of the offspring and indication of long-term support.  One of Darwin's great insights is that while males may do much posturing prior to copulation, it is the females who ultimately accept or reject the male's advances.  This situation is reflected in the title of the book.  While a female may accept one male for some aspects, she may wander afield searching for others for different reasons.  Even a male bird seeking food or other mates may return to the nest to find himself displaced.  Whose chicks will he be feeding?<br /><br />Once offspring have been produced, a whole new spectrum of behaviours is unleashed.  How many stable households have been disrupted by parent-offspring conflict?  Twain's Huckleberry Finn, with no mother and a dysfunctional father, moves from one surrogate family to another.  None beat him, reject him nor judge him, but he leaves them all, closing his narrative with the intent to \\"light out for the territories\\".  As children mature, they develop their own agendas.  From the \\"terrible twos\\" to the stresses of adolescence, parent-offspring conflicts reflect the stress of developing individuality, which may only be fulfilled by flight.<br /><br />We've waited a long time for the insights provided here.  Although the Barashes aren't the first to attempt this technique, this book is clearly the best effort made to date.  The authors explain every factor clearly, there's no need for the reader to have a degree in zoology.  Preconceived notions of what literature is about, however, should be placed in a tightly locked container.  There are new and challenging ideas here and every fiction reader should consider them.

Location, characters and events may be fully invented or adapted from reality as the writer wishes. The better writers usually provide an explanation for some of the more unlikely depictions. In fantasy, the implausible is part of the attraction. All that's left for the reader is to accept the result. This book is such a confused melange of fact and fantasy that the reader is likely to finish it dismayed. Ostensibly taking place in Southern California at the end of the Ice Age, one might believe the fantasy is the frosting on the cake of reality. Instead, it's the reverse - fantasy dominates and reality is plugged in rather at the authors' whim.<br /><br />Tep's Town is a structured community in the Los Angeles Basin. There are Lords at the top, Lordkin in a vague middle and the kinless at the bottom. The kinless wear a rope noose [to indicate the possibility of lynching for disobedience?] around their necks as a sign of their status. They haul the water, cut the wood and provide just about everything the Lordkin wish. The Lordkin \\"gather\\" a term translated in the book as \\"steal\\" - \\"confiscate\\" would do as well. What has held such a chaotic society together long enough to build towns and trade routes remains unexplained.<br /><br />One Lordkin, Whandall Placehold [\\"freeman\\", one presumes], is a \\"street-smart\\" kid who accidentally visits an aristocrat's home. He almost falls in love, but his hormones aren't yet up to the task - he's only nine. Still, the event provides Whandall with a new view of that element of society. He gains greater insight into the bottom rung, as well. Especially when he encounters \\"the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen\\". She's ensconced in a hidden compartment of a wagon with other kids, road dust and certainly the excrement of their extended journey. That condition is blithely ignored - by the authors and Whandall alike, leaving our Hero smitten, but not besmirched. His olfactory powers being minimal, his magical powers are correspondingly ample. He has a god, Yagen-Atep, at his call. Y-A is hot stuff - and Whandall can fire up whole communities with his spirit.<br /><br />The resulting conflagration sends Whandall, along with his nubile, but unconsummated love, on the road. Giving up his life of privileged idleness, Whandall follows the trade routes and expands his knowledge and experience. Keeping his pyromaniacal deity at bay, he takes up a quest imparted by a wizard, Morth. That this wizard is from Atlantis is one of the more jarring notes in this book. We have The Ice, redwoods in LA because the Times reported them, and a greenhouse-full of obnoxious plants. But, \\"Atlantis\\"?? Morth, anticipating later reality, succumbs to \\"gold fever\\" a la the Forty-Niners, but the gold is magic and the \\"fever\\" the madness of possessing its power. Is that power on the wane? is the big question here, and Whandall, as a protagonist, struggles to find out.<br /><br />There are worse fantasy books than this one, but not much. The authors, who have excellent SF and \\"real world\\" credentials, seem to have tried to incorporate too much from both here. The mixture is a marginal success because their prose skills are highest quality. They've tried to break from traditional [i.e., Tolkienesque] fantasy, but it doesn't quite work.

Scepticism means assaulting dogmas - read \\"entrenched stupidity\\" - and coping with the reaction.  Shermer, who puts his scepticism on public view in his magazine, isn't lacking courage.  With a flair for investigative journalism and a fine prose style to render results into words, he is always an informative and entertaining read.  This collection of his articles is a delight, unmarred by the passage of time.  Each one addresses a topic of enduring interest, guaranteeing a \\"read again\\" condition for these essays for some time to come.<br /><br />Shermer displays his mettle up front by taking up roles in performing in the \\"paranormal\\".  He \\"reads\\" Tarot cards, palms of hands and the stars.  All of these experiments demonstrate the gullibility of those too inept or too lazy to learn how hollow these techniques really are.  Why people believe such phenomena can answer the problems of everyday life remains one of our great mysteries.  Shermer isn't addressing these topics from an \\"intellectual high ground\\" but from real experience.  In his youth he was a Christian, buying into all the contrived legends and empty myths that superstition perpetuates.  Discovering reality, he abandoned the trappings of deceptive teachings and struck out against them - all of them.  This collection of essays isn't only a display of his experiences, it's ammunition we may all use in dealing with other misleading or manipulative teachings.<br /><br />As a collection of writings on various topics, this book is naturally difficult to categorise.  He  discusses the difficulties the \\"secular humanists\\" endured with the creation of The Brights.  The Brights are an attempt to coalesce the various non-theists in our society.  While the name is logical, especially given its true meaning, American society has granted it the rank of a slur on those who refuse to accept easy dogmas.  Essays on \\"heresies of science\\" and \\"spin-doctoring science\\" are a depressing indication of how the public lacks understanding of what science does and has done.  If a particular column must be selected as noteworthy, it's Shermer's discussion of the Cancer in the Classroom, \\"intelligent design\\".  Although much has been written on this insidious threat from Christians attempting to destroy scientific education, Shermer's essay \\"The New New Creationism\\" is an excellent overview.  He summarises the history and tactics of the movement, recognising that only reality can counter it.  Understanding of reality comes through education.  It's a vicious circle.<br /><br />Shermer concludes the collection with an adulatory essay on Stephen J. Gould.  It's almost embarrassing to read.  Shermer recounts John Maynard Smith's assessment that Gould's ideas were \\"so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with\\".  Although intending to praise Gould, Shermer then goes on to prove Maynard Smith correct.  Following the US academic theme of \\"publish or perish\\", Shermer does his sums - even to the level of word count.  How much did Gould publish and on what?  After gathering his numbers, Shermer goes on to shuffle them around by categories.  We are given line, bar and pie charts as tokens of Gould's worth.  That Gould had wide interests is a given.  Baseball, a topic that puzzled Maynard Smith, loomed largest.  Evolution, of course, was a major theme, with history of science close behind.  What Shermer omits is Gould's approach to these topics.  He enjoyed lifting people from obscurity and defending the indefenisble.  Shermer notes Gould's resurrection of Jimmie Ussher's reputation [while misspelling his name], but ignores Gould's constant chipping away of Darwin's or Wallace's.  Perhaps Shermer should have included a category for this approach in his counts.  This flawed essay is the low point of the book, yet it is well presented and informative.

From cover to cover, if you wish.  Selecting topics of personal interest and ignoring all else, if that's your preference.  There's pleasure gained by arbitrary random choices as well as with following cross-references to see where they lead.  One thing is certain about this collection, you won't be disappointed in whichever path you follow.  And there's a laugh per page, if not per entry.<br /><br />Ever since the Enlightenment and Diderot's compendium of the natural world, encyclopaedias have remained a buttress to learning.  Some of us had the \\"EB\\" as children almost as a matter of course.  All these references were collections of facts - about nature, people, literature - almost anything you might name.  Rarely is an encyclopaedia a collection of one man's imaginative musings.  And there are few writers around with the imagination, wit and prose style of Terry Pratchett.  If you can catalogue a man's thoughts, it's been done with this \\"Discworld Companion\\".<br /><br />In the earlier part of his career, Pratchett declared he didn't strive for consistency or much order in his writings.  Characters, events and places on the Discworld could vary in personality, happen and be forgotten, or be seen and lost.  The same place wasn't always in the same place twice.  With so many books, so large a fan base and a deluge of questions, some level of order was demanded.  Although there is a web page devoted to sources for the origins of Pratchettean allusions, there has never been a catalogue of persons, places and events.  Hence this book.<br /><br />The Companion is a rich trove of entries, many enhanced by Briggs' delightful illustrations.  Anyone can read it.  The long-term fan will find explanations for things encountered.  The novice cruising through here will likely respond: \\"She did what?\\" and nip over to buy the referenced book.  Major Discworld figures are fleshed out by background material not found in the stories.  Characters with fleeting exposure in the books, are explained more fully here.  Places are described in detail and placed in historical context.  One can almost see Twoflower, the Discworld's first tourist, clutching this book as he gazes in wonder at the Place of Lamentations in Kom, major city of Klatch.  He will leave soon for the Orohai Peninsula in quest of a sponge lunch.  Don't believe me?  You could look it up.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]n the stories.

But it's the skull that captures the  most attention.  The multitude of variations that occurred as animals moved in delicate steps from water onto land that make the story most interesting.  And Jenny Clack's story of our four-legged forebears is a wondrous tale.  Ever since Charles Darwin explained the nature of life's evolution, the question of how sea creatures moved to the land has been an enigma.  Consider the many issues involved: walking, breathing air instead of filtering water, hearing in air instead of water, how to feed - and where, and protecting eggs.  Clack shows how these topics were addressed by slow, incremental changes in body plan, with changes in one area integrated with those in another.<br /><br />Walking on land meant not only building bones strong enough to support the body, but muscles to drive them.  The humerus, the single bone in your upper arm, not only had to be stronger, it had to have joints for a new form of movement.  A stride is far different from the flapping of a fin, so the paddling fin had to change.  Clack discounts the older, simpler views that the \\"lobe-finned\\" fish just developed better \\"legs\\".  Moving from the sea requires more than just crawling up the beach.  There had to be an intermediate step.  Clack finds that step in brackish lagoons and shallow, meandering rivers.  There, the new four-legged creatures learned to walk on silty soils and learn to mix air and water breathing methods.<br /><br />It was a reinforcing cycle as the change in surroundings developed new capacities.  Diet went from fish to insects.  No longer able to simply swallow prey as fish do, tetrapods began feeding on insects and their own smaller cousins.  That meant biting and chewing, requiring stronger jaws and specialised teeth.  Skulls once short and narrow became wide and flat.  This  reorganising of the entire skull required new musclature for support.  The more time on land, Clack shows, meant not only stronger legs, but a sturdier backbone.  Ribs developed that held muscles for breathing.  Although the earliest tetrapods likely gulped air as a fish gulps water, before long they were using their nostrils to fill lungs.<br /><br />As should be obvious, this isn't a simple narrative.  The fossil bones are meticulously detailed - when they are available.  Clack's task is rendered more difficult by the paucity of fossils.  She has been lucky in her own finds in Greenland and Scotland.  Others have encountered Carboniferous fossils in the Ohio Valley, Nova Scotia and Australia.  The real treasures should be in coal seams where plant remains have become burnable stone.  However, mining operations leave little opportunity for discovery.  What has been found has often been misinterpreted.  In order to depict what  happened to tetrapod bodies over time, she is meticulous in describing individual bone types and how they changed.  She helps the description with photographs and a wealth of line drawings.  Still, this isn't a book for the uninitiated.  It requires careful reading and no little back-flipping of the pages.  The endeavour is well worth the effort, however.  Clack has established an new foundation for understanding where and how creatures like ourselves originated.

Books	5	7	7	N	N	Fabulous fables formed from facts	Two millennia of condemnation of \\"pagan\\" mythology have obscured the value ancient legends contributed to knowledge.  Being members of this world instead of longing for the next, our ancient ancestors were keen observers of Nature.  Among their interests were \\"mythical monsters\\".  The Griffin - a combination of lion and eagle; the Minotaur - a man with a bull's head; or the Cyclops - a man with but one eye.  These familiar characters emerged from ancient Mediterranean societies and transmitted down to our own time.  Lost in the transmission was the notion that there might be a factual basis for such creatures.  Adrienne Mayor wants to clarify the origins of mythological creatures.  In this excellent study, she challenges fixed thinking about myths' origins.<br /><br />The Mediterranean is a dynamic place.  Continental plates collide, pushing up mountains, diverting rivers and causing sea basins to flood or become dry.  The constantly changing conditions reveal long buried fossil sites.  Mayor builds a vivid picture of how the ancient Greeks, Egyptians and Romans might encounter these strange artefacts and attempt to make sense of them.  What would these bizarre skulls, teeth or thigh bones mean to them?  They were aware of anatomy and didn't mistake a leg bone for a vertebrae.  Their reconstructions of the artefacts were reasonably accurate.  They \\"knew\\" the fossils represented once-living creatures.  Not having mastered the scientific discipline of today, they \\"interpreted\\" the exposed fossils in human terms - stories of mighty people, heroic deeds and lost worlds.  Mayor argues that fossils led the ancients to understand life wasn't fixed.  Creatures and humans alike had once lived in ancient times, then died out.  Extinction was a real possibility - it had already happened.<br /><br />Combining photographs and expressive line drawings to supplement her text, Mayor offers vivid evidence of the source for many mythical creatures.  When bone assemblages of several species jumbled together were found, it was only logical to assume a single creature was once built around them.  Hence, we are told of bull-headed men, or lions with an eagle's beak.  We can see how the image of a bizarre creature emerging from a cave is actually a dinosaur fossil protruding from an eroding cliff.  The view on a vase painting depicts this scene with superb clarity.  With no idea of the Earth's true age, it was easy to make these judgements.  Mythology is built from human experience, so it was fitting to give these creatures human characteristics.<br /><br />Mayor's challenge to both classical scholars and paleontology permeates the book.  The long history of dismissal of legendary creatures and the myths surrounding them blinds both scholars and the public alike, she contends.  She suggests scientists and classicists enlarge their views of the information and evidence and reconsider how we perceive the past.  As an example, Aristotle was long attributed as advocating fixity of species; a notion seized on by Christian scholars.  Mayor demonstrates this is a limited reading of the philosopher.  More such revelations might come to light if open-minded researchers seek further.  Some documents have shown how the ancients measured and assessed fossil.  They were clearly aware that fossils demonstrated that contemporary life and past life were similar but not identical.

He also coined the term \\"meme\\" to explain the dissemination of ideas across societies.  Almost immediately, there was a strident chorus of objection, based on the theme of \\"you can't say that about humans!\\"  The outcry hasn't ceased, but in the case of Richerson and Boyd, it's become somewhat muted.  This book is designed to gently persuade you that human evolution rests on a solid \\"cultural\\" base.  Biology is under there somewhere, but for humanity, cultural impact overwhelms our genetic roots.<br /><br />The authors would like to abandon the dichotomy of what's usually referred to as the \\"nature versus nurture\\" debate.  That's admirable, but not only has that contest been challenged elsewhere, finding anyone adhering to either position as an absolute is difficult, if not impossible.  Who claims \\"genes\\" are the sole behaviour drive?  Not even religions, the most dogmatic element in our society, any longer label infants as \\"blank slates\\" to be moulded at will.  Individuality and expression may be curtailed, but not constrained.  Yet that curtailment, even if only mindless imitation, is the foundation of this book.  Instead of the chaos of individual response to environmental pressures, \\"culture\\" guides behaviour to the extent that groups become predictable in their activities.  For them, \\"culture\\" is a sort of behavioural umbrella keeping families and small communities from unravelling the fabric of society.<br /><br />Richerson and Boyd gather a wide spectrum of studies to erect their cultural edifice.  They examine studies of social animals, scrutinise the grim world of economics and wonder how it is that of all species, human beings filled nearly every environmental niche.  They accept the complexity of human society as naturally hierarchical.  That organisation, coupled with a strong imitative/cooperative sense enabled our species to readily adapt to so many ecological niches.  Where some say, \\"If it works, don't fix it!\\", Richerson and Boyd counter, \\"If it works, imitate it!\\"  Human beings, they contend, are better imitators than other species because we can judge long-term impacts of actions.  This talent, coupled with language, provides our unique adaptability in varied environments.  We can test for success and pass our findings to our neighbours.  This gives groups within our species both unique abilities and the means to improve them.  Not all of humanity is but one culture.  It's a melange of groups, each culture representing a regional or social norm.<br /><br />\\"Group selection\\" is the offshoot of an older, flawed, evolutionary concept - \\"species selection\\".  With the idea of \\"species selection\\" quickly demonstrated as false, group selection arose to replace it.  A close look at group selection reveals that it's but another mechanism to keep humanity separated from the remainder of the animal kingdom.  If you downplay any similarities between us and other beasts, you are able to retain a \\"divine spark\\" or other metaphysical notions for humanity.  And only humanity.  Richerson and Boyd's use of animal behaviour studies to ameliorate this distinction are a welcome addition to social studies.  However, these examples are carefully selected and interpreted by the authors.  They aren't set in an evolutionary context, but are given solely as a contrast to the also carefully chosen aspects of human behaviour.  The book raises a number of interesting questions, but answers few of them satisfactorily.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]to readily adapt to so many ecological niches.

Huck Finn's opening to his autobiography is particularly appropriate here.  This book can't be enjoyed, almost not read, unless you have completed \\"The Burning City\\", its predecessor.  For starters, your first question will be \\"what time period does this take place in?\\"  A little research reveals you'll be many thousands of years off - in the wrong direction!  Appearing at first like one of the standard post-nuclear holocaust fantasies, it turns out to be many millennia in the past.  Niven and Pournelle have violated a guideline of trilogy writing.  If you pick up this book assuming it's a \\"stand-alone\\" novel, you will be sadly disappointed.  If you start it as a fantasy adventure story, you will find much excitement, adventure and, of course, travel.  What's a fantasy story for if not to go on quests in distant lands?  Well, that's not quite the case here.<br /><br />Location questions are dispelled by the maps provided.  The story takes place in Southern California.  In what's now called the Los Angeles Basin, there exists a multi-layered society.  There are Lords and Ladies, Lordkin, who seem to be minor aristocrats, and the kinless - the bottom of society.  As with today, bushfires are a matter of concern in this arid environment.  A fire sets off this story in revealing the rivalry within the aristocrat clans and threats from other clan groups.  Ameliorating this rather medieval scene are the merchants' wagon trains.  To keep commerce flowing, wagon trains are pretty much left in peace, except by bandits - and \\"terror birds\\".<br /><br />The terror birds, which almost elude physical description, become the core of the story.  They seem to be an archaeopteryx with an attitude.  Having attacked the merchants' wagons, they've also destroyed whole villages and besieged a town.  Having upgraded from solitary attacker to group assault, the birds are clearly becoming a serious threat.  Are they being guided using magic?  Lord Sandry joins the Feathersnake caravan to find out.  He encounters the gypsy beauty queen Burning Tower [you never learn the source of the name] and romance flares.  Oh, yes.  As a virgin, Tower is allowed a \\"bonehead\\" - a unicorn - for a mount.  It's all quite genre stuff.  Sandry, the Hero of this tale, doesn't have a quest.  He's just riding shotgun for the commercial travellers.  Still, he's allowed some heroic activity with a bit of help from his [girl]friends.<br /><br />The framework of this fantasy fable is that \\"there's gold in them thar hills\\".  Gold is one of the sources of \\"manna\\" [magic] that makes things happen in this rather disjointed tale.  So is petrified wood.  The problem with magic is that once introduced by an author[s], there are no limits to its use.  Magic is available to certain types who use others as pawns in power struggles.  In this bizarre Southern California environment, it is gods who wield that power most significantly.  Unless they are turned into myths, which depletes their prowess.  Magic, like gold in a later age, is being depleted.  Dire predictions for the future permeate this story, and the result will surely be depicted in the next volume.  However, i will not be learning the accuracy of the predictions.  I haven't yet worked out how Atlantis found it's way to the Pacific Ocean before sinking, as this novel implies.

There are risks inherent in literary criticism.  Is it justifiable to analyse a writer's work?  Is there danger of \\"reading in\\" to what the author actually says?  Can you derive an author's thoughts through assessment of the text[s]?  What service does criticism provide the reader?  Literary criticism has been compared to someone chewing on writing and leaving the residue in a nearby paddock - watch your step.  That charge isn't valid in this collection on one of our most unique writers.  Certainly, our most unique \\"fantasy\\" writer.  It is the fantasy base that has allowed some critics to place Pratchett's work outside \\"mainstream\\" literature.  This set of essays sets that displacement to rest as invalid.<br /><br />Terry Pratchett has produced three dozen books on his Discworld theme, complemented by the Bromeliad and Johnny Maxwell series plus some \\"children's books\\".  Anyone writing such a corpus without repeating himself has some special qualities.  The authors of these essays examine those qualities and find them among the best of fantasy writing.  Whether the theme is Comedy, Tragedy, Heroes and \\"Leaders\\" or the conditions of everyday urban life, the writers show how Pratchett eases reality into view.  Everything he writes contains material valuable in understanding ourselves.  Even his humour, say these authors, imparts views of reality we may both laugh at and reflect on.  How many writers share that skill?<br /><br />Some critics claim to know how an author thinks.  Edward James' essay, in this anthology of fourteen, has the closest valid connection to Pratchett's thoughts.  They exchanged letters when they attended different schools together.  Many of Pratchett's early ideas were formulated in his teen years.  Exploring some of those ideas resulted in \\"The Carpet People\\", a book Pratchett wrote twice.  \\"The Carpet People\\", his first venture into fantasy, was almost \\"formula\\" in it's character depiction.  As several of these essays explain, Pratchett moved away from absolutes, creating unheroic heroes and compassionate evildoers.  However Pratchett thinks, these writers assert, it's not in simple terms.  His Discworld characters are far more complex than those of the \\"genre\\" fantasy.  The comparison with Tolkien is inevitable, and several authors point out the distinctions between the two authors.<br /><br />The writings here address Pratchett's characterisations - human, animal, anthropomorphic personifications and even a building complex.  The list manifests the scope of Pratchett's grasp.  Every reader will find a favourite, from Vimes to Vetinari.  Although judging these contributions is difficult, perhaps Farah Mendelsohn's provides the most insight.  She certainly tackles the most serious and difficult subjects.  If nothing else, her comments justify the view that Pratchett is as much philosopher as fantasy author.  Titled \\"Faith and Ethics\\", she describes how religion is dealt with in Discworld books.  From \\"faith\\", she notes how ethics may rely on teachings - parental, academic or religious - but remains a question of how an individual deals with ethical challenges.  Pratchett, eschewing absolutes as he does, produces scenarios in his tales that leave his readers clear that we must all make our own choices.  There is no \\"escape from reality\\" here, she argues.  We identify \\"self\\" not through others, but as we choose to see ourselves.  As a \\"mirror of worlds\\" the Discworld confronts us with how to make that identification - and, \\"the Truth Shall Make You Fret\\".<br /><br />For the Pratchett reader, this is an indispensable book.  For the newcomer to the Discworld or his other works, this will be a resource to appreciating his wide readership.  Young and old alike take to Pratchett for his unique approach to fantasy, to his characters and to the insights he stimulates us to consider.  It says much that since the first edition of this book, its content has been enlarged.  So long as Pratchett continues to write, there will be reasons to reflect on his ideas.  There will be another edition of this book.  Read Pratchett while you're waiting.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]o write, there will be reasons to reflect on his ideas.

That means giving up countless adolescent pleasures.  He won't be able to make exploratory journeys into the marshes or ponder the mysteries of the Joker Towers.  Of Old Earth ancestry, Dom's home is Widdershins, a planet producing a special pharmaceutical - pilac.  The demand for this drug has made the Sabalos family powerful and rich beyond calculation.  It says much that Dom's godfather is a bank.  IS a bank - one that takes up an entire planet.<br /><br />Being rich and powerful evokes enemies, even when your wealth is gratefully contributed to by all who take pilac.  Which is nearly all sentient creatures.  There are other species scattered about the universe, but they all appear to be approximately the same duration - four or five million years.  Before that, there seem to have been The Jokers.  As Dom flees Widdershins to thwart assassination, he seeks answers to the Joker mystery.  The quest leads to endless adventures and opens many questions in the reader's mind.  The main one being: \\"Who are we, and where did we come from?\\"<br /><br />In today's world, \\"Dark Side\\" can occupy only a special niche.  Older - sorry! \\"established\\" - Pratchett readers may look upon this book as an historical curiosity.  The really established SF reader will see the obvious reliance on Isaac Asimov's \\"Robot\\" series.  In \\"Dark Side\\", the very intelligent robot is named \\"Isaac\\".  Douglas Adams' \\"probability math\\" is given place and complex problems are solved by a team of a poet and a \\"mad computer\\".  The book's themes and characters are very \\"1970s SciFi\\".  Yet the sparks of the later Discworld books shine brightly here.  Beyond the carryovers of such ideas as Hogswatch Night, Small Gods and Widdershins itself, there are the usual touches of Pratchettean irony and insight.  There is also the underlying foundation of Pratchett's capacity for bringing remote facts and ideas into his stories.  There are Gypsy terms, ancient Philistine goddesses and touches of Classical Greek theatre.<br /><br />These literary arabesques are what makes Pratchett a repeatable read, no matter what genre critics try to cram him into.  Although nearly thirty years have passed since this was written, it remains worthy of a place on your bookshelf.

We have seen stories we venerated proven false and misleading.  What credence, then, can we give to \\"primitive\\" tales orally transmitted down the generations\\" It seems there is much substance to be found in these \\"obsolete\\" myths.  They often reflect real events, which we can understand and verify if we learn how to look properly.  The Barbers open with an occurrence on North America's West Coast dated seven millennia ago.  Crater Lake is a delightful view today.  In 1865 an investigator learned from the Klamath Indians that two deities, clashing over the fate of a woman, filled the sky with ash and smoke accompanied by thunder and lightning.  The battle's residue was a mighty caldera, later filled with water, which the Klamath people will not enter.  How did a volcanic eruption remain in folk memory so long?<br /><br />The authors contend that natural events are kept active in human memory for long periods by the process of story telling.  The \\"narrative imperative\\" is an essential product of human evolution.  As primates, we are group dwellers who have learned to enhance social cohesion through communication.  Story telling reinforces chosen events and people related to them in memory.  While the actual circumstances may not be literally true as related many generations later, the essence of the event will be retained.  Our memories are selective, say the Barbers, and stories held important rank higher in priority than even recent, but less significant, occurrences.  This is the reason many legends, from many peoples bear an almost uncanny similarity.  They reflect similar, often violent events - volcanoes, earthquakes and tsunamis figure large in their origins.  Natural events, integrated with accounts of people's lives, become the foundation of social history.  They relate the tales of heroes [and heroines], gods and rulers.  Unravelling the threads woven into the account of the original event isn't an easy task, but the Barbers explain how it has been done.  Today's technology is of vast help, since reliable dating is now a mainstay in myth analysis.<br /><br />The Barbers make clever use of terms in presenting their ideas.  The brain, they say, relies on \\"Redundancy Strategy\\" which can be countered by the \\"Silence Principle\\".  In effect, the mind seeks things to remember.  Whatever isn't used is cast away.  The \\"Movie Construct\\" is a method of deriving the origins of stories from what is known now.  Filling in the missing details becomes an exercise of using known experiences or simply fabricating.  A related concept is the \\"Adversary Principle\\".  The persistent story of Mount Mazama creating Crater Lake is a good example.  People learning the lake was created by two deities in a dispute is both logical and meaningful in oral traditions.  Time and distance lead to the \\"Fogging Effect\\" in which what occurs and what is remembered and passed on as stories may be drastically different.  If the student understands how this works in the mind, the fog may be brushed aside to reveal the original event.  Keeping the terms straight is easy, since the authors provide an Appendix, which lists the Index of Myth Principles.<br /><br />Although the Bibliography fails to list a single work in cognitive science, the authors' proposals merit attention.  The details of how the brain holds and processes the information about significant events is less important than recognising that it does so.  Once obtained, particularly with group memory acting to buttress retention, the foundation for oral history is firmly in place.  The authors' argument to avoid thoughtless dismissal of myths is sound.  They demonstrate the way events are mythologised in a way both informative and entertaining.  A useful and welcome book.

Unless we better understand our relations we will never properly understand ourselves.  His sweeping examination of various aspects of the living world shows us we have a special place, but not a unique one.  Living creatures have many shared aspects of their lives.  We need to study them more closely.  The investigation, however, must be a more penetrating view than we've too often used in the past.  The distinctions in behaviour in our nearest cousins in cages and in the wild are an indication of the needed effort.  How much of our training chimpanzees is actually their manipulation of us?  'What is their intention compared to ours?' is a major theme.<br /><br />Dunbar's writing is far from the pedant's academic style - further enlivened by some graphic examples and a few charts.  Although most of this work is recounting research studies in field and laboratory, his descriptions of behaviour leave you feeling you've been watching with the observer.  In setting each topic theme, he opens the chapter with a scenario from the past.  One of our ancestors is participating in cave painting, preparing for the hunt or communing with spirits.  These are events comprising the roots of our cultures.<br /><br />The author shows how our construction of cultures resulted from a more complex [NOT \\"higher\\"] reasoning prowess.  The complexity arises in our capacity to build and unravel \\"levels\\" of intentionality.  From an individual's intention to act Dunbar takes us through the various levels to show how Shakespeare [to cite but one example] intended his audiences to comprehend the intentions of his various interacting characters.  Although it is fairly common for humans to achieve five levels of intentionality, reaching the sixth is more than just a mental chore.  Dunbar admits his attempt to surpass that grade ended in futility accompanied by an empty whisky bottle.<br /><br />Even so, the fifth and sixth levels are what set us apart from our primate relations.  This cognitive ability, coupled with our physiology, is what granted us speech - an unshared trait.  Dunbar spends some time examining speech.  The dispute over what constitutes \\"language\\" has been long and sometimes acrimonious.  Unsurprisingly, he doesn't fully resolve the question, but provides sufficient detail to help the reader understand the issues.  When, for example, do simple, silent gestures become a form of language?  Dunbar has previously discussed the role of grooming in building communications abilities and expands on those ideas here.<br /><br />As a concluding note, Dunbar examines the issue of religion - another aspect setting us apart from the other animals.  Events, communicated to others, often leads to questioning cause.  When the cause of an event cannot be identified, it becomes attributed to the supernatural and religion is born.  So long as enough people communicate a common cause for events, religion becomes a cohesion factor in society - both informing and controlling one's neighbours.  This alone requires careful understanding and manipulation of the orders of intentionality.  Do we truly need religion in order to have a feeling of belonging in our community?  This is but one of the challenging questions Dunbar poses.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]sixth levels are what set us apart from our primate relations.

There are more people, more pollution, more profit and more challenges.  Although the city is now touted as \\"Silicon Valley North\\", there are other new industries taking root here besides electronics and telecommunications.  One of the most dynamic new ventures is that of biotechnology.  While telecommunications makes advances through ever higher speeds, biotechnology progresses through diversity.  Moving biotechnology from the laboratory to the market can be a risky venture, as Marwan Hassan depicts in his exciting new novel.<br /><br />Alec Knight is a PI in Ottawa.  \\"Private Investigator\\" is a term with a long, sometimes sordid, history.  Hassan's Alec is beyond the \\"tough guy\\" image other writers and Hollywood have given us.  As an investigator for Lajoie-Chang Associates, he's given the task of retrieving a stolen briefcase.  In a town dominated by briefcase-bearing bureaucrats, such a task might seem insurmountable.  A quick insertion of a screwdriver, rifling the case of its contents and into the nearest dumster would be the usual pattern.  This briefcase, however, follows a more leisurely career.  There's reason to believe it not only remains intact, but can be traced.  Although its destination is likely \\"South of the Border\\", there's a good chance it remains in Ottawa.  The documents inside have information vital to patenting, corporate investments and a surging market.  The information might result in a cure for HIV/AIDS.<br /><br />Alec isn't knowledgeable about biotechnology nor medicine.  He knows people, however.  He knows how to tease information from them, goad them into indiscretions and balance what they hold in with what he needs from them.  He's a keen observer.  In following Alec's investigation, Hassan takes us through the complex webs of corporate development.  He explains how companies form and expand, dissolve and disappear, acquire and eject parts.  It's a complex, twisted path, but it's something Alec must comprehend if he's to trace the threads of power and decision-making.  Alec, a graduate of criminology school, who's never heard of John Donne and thinks Pascal is only a computer language, must learn those intricacies.  As Hassan portrays Alec, the PI is strong in native cunning and isn't lacking in professional demeanor.<br /><br />In tracking the missing briefcase, Alec ventures through Ottawa's many faces, both physical and personal.  He must tread carefully in back alleys glistening with abandoned dope syringes.  He must tread carefully with wealthy and powerful corporate officers who demand results while often hedging essential information - if they don't conceal it altogether.  Hassan follows Alec into Ottawa's multicultural community.  We meet Somalis with biology degrees.  They drive taxis because their science educations aren't recognised by either government officials or corporate \\"human resource\\" staff.  A Congolese, another taxi man, keeps Alec spellbound in describing the shameless use of African peoples in testing new pharmaceuticals.  Blood has been modified from life's essential elixir to become a profitable commidity - even a diplomatic issue.  It's Alec's task to balance all these inputs in his quest to retrieve the stolen case.  He must listen and evaluate a wealth of details while tracking the elusive container.<br /><br />Hassan's depiction of Ottawa won't find space in the tourist brochures.  It is, however, a valid picture of the result of the city's maturation process.  Industry is there, in strength.  With it comes competition, deception, and maneuvering [Hassan's explanation of the meaning of \\"MBA\\" is priceless].  Ottawa isn't a city noted for violence, but it's there nonetheless.  And it's not always something we can simply look away from in distaste.  We need not participate in it to be involved - even while remaining ignorant of cause and effect.<br /><br />Hassan's style is dynamic and captivating.  There are few dull moments in this tale of conspiracy, manipulation and evasion.  The reference to Canada's national newspaper is hilarious, but might elude someone in Southern Pines, NC.  These meagre lapses don't detract from this book's value for either entertainment or information.  Hassan clearly indulged in an immense research task, yet manages to show facts in a stirring tale.

Since its quiet appearance in 1996, Al-Jazeera has continuously added viewers. It wasn't long before TVs in Europe and North America were tuning in to the one station that seemed to speak with a plausible Arab voice. What immediately distinguished this from other Arabic news and discussion programmes was its willingness to broadcast everybody's views. Although funded by the Emir of Qatar, Al-Jazerra was not a voice of its host government. It kept its news strictly factual and offered air time to voices dissenting from government policies. Anything going on the Arab world was discussed. Consequently, many contrasting views were aired, some of which criticised various governments in the region. But opinions and news were, and are, kept separate.<br /><br />Discovering the phenomenon of Al-Jazeera had been discussed but had never been given an overview, Hugh Miles set out to rectify that lack. This son of a diplomat had solid credentials for researching the history of the new news channel. Fluent in Arabic, Miles was able to talk to station management, reporters and viewers in various places. His summation is an excellent example of investigative reporting, well presented. By the time Miles began his project, the subject had already undergone both amazing growth and intemperate vilification. He explains how Arab governments find Al-Jazeera a fomenter of sedition and rebellion. Some see it as a tool of the Isreali government seeking to destabilise Arab rulers, while others are certain it's an arm of the CIA. Americans, especially the Bush regime, view it as a mouthpiece for terrorist societies and probably anti-Isreal. Viewers, Miles finds, all have their own opinions about Al-Jazeera's political orientation, but still make it their first choice for Middle East news.<br /><br />The key event in Al-Jazeera's progress was, of course, the 9/11 attacks on the WTC and Pentagon. Any news from the Arab world suddenly became of great importance and Al-Jazeera was clearly the leading voice. That situation probably led Al-Queda to use it as a conveyance for pronouncements to the world. Al-Queda tapes broadcast on Al-Jazeera immediately led to the branding of the station as a \\"voice of terrorism\\". Station management laughs at that, particularly when the western news channels are breaking down the doors to use Al-Jazeera news clips they cannot obtain elsewhere. The competition at one point was stiff enough to lead CNN to write a contract giving it Al-Jazeera video clips six hours ahead of the other broadcasters. The invasion of Afghanistan intensified the situation, since Al-Jazeera was the only news source on the ground when attacks began.<br /><br />There's a risk being at the forefront of a battle to report events. Americans, certain that Al-Jazeera was \\"the mouthpiece of Al-Queda\\", \\"accidently\\" destroyed the Kabul office. Later, in Baghdad, more \\"accidents\\" occurred, this time killing one reporter. Al-Jazeera was the sole occupier of the Palestine Hotel, which was also attacked. No \\"accidents\\" happened to other news agencies. And the attacks occurred after Al-Jazeera had informed the Defence Department of their locations in the city. Correspondents are supposed to be immune from assault by military forces. Iraqis themselves avoided being interviewed because the station was presumed to be a target of American military forces.<br /><br />It says much that the United States has demanded the Emir \\"tone down\\" the station's material. He has rejected these admonishments, both because they're self-defeating and because he funds the station without managing it. Meanwhile, the viewers increase daily and the addition of an English-language channel will broaden it further. Viewers now look for the \\"golden plum\\" logo on one corner of the screen to ensure they're watching an authentic news source. Subscription to Al-Jazeera is a minimal cost, considering you'll see news unavailable elsewhere.

Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh stooped to nearly every form of chicanery, bombast, and personal vituperation in their quest to become the United States' foremost palaeontologist.  Instead of burying their dispute in academic journals, it was widely broadcast in the media of the day - newspapers.  In this excellent study, Wallace traces the histories of the two, their colleagues and defenders.  Although the stack of books on \\"the bone wars\\" has reached staggering proportions, Wallace has found an overlooked pivotal figure around which to march the protagonists of this stirring account.<br /><br />James Gordon Bennett becomes a distant member of this triage while he rebuilds the New York Herald into a major newspaper.  Bennett, at least as unorthodox as the scientists, kept the dispute between the two rivals well fanned throughout the latter part of the 19th Century.  It proved a fine technique for boosting circulation, at least for a time.  Any student of the period will recognise that \\"selling\\" dominated nearly all aspects of life, from newspapers to new species.  Bennett had a pair of newsworthy characters to portray during their dispute, in Wallace's account.  Marsh's and Cope's lives made good stories in themselves.  Marsh, a New England patrician had \\"come into money\\" through an uncle.  Cope, a Philadelphia Quaker, poured increasing amounts of the family fortune into fossil collecting expeditions.<br /><br />Wallace is unable to find any specific event leading to the great rivalry.  Once started, however, it burgeoned quickly and with great intensity.  There were accusations of pilfering of fossils and plagiarising of journal papers.  Professional journals were less restrained in those times, but ultimately both men had submissions scotched as being too harsh.  The issue was almost always primacy - which one had found and named new species.  The journals were the mechanism, but newspapers were sometimes utilised to established a find or novel dinosaur.  Bone collections grew as the pace of the hunt overrode the time needed to prepare descriptions.  The pair were always close with neither gaining significant ground over the other, while the newspaper-reading public avidly followed the race.<br /><br />It was government priorities and money that finally gave Marsh the edge, Wallace tells us.  The new Geological Survey, established to find mineral and timber resources, also had the money and power to assign when and where expeditions might go and fund the chosen ones.  Marsh had an ally in John Wesley Powell who was a force in the Survey.  Bypassed by the Survey, Cope bled away his inheritance mounting fossil-hunting expeditions in the American West - some of them solo.  His health suffered due to long excursions in the field.  Ultimately, his wife, unable to bear financial instability and dealing with a man whose vast enterprises exceeded her ability to cope, departed.  Cope, alone, continued.<br /><br />Wallace's treatment of this famous dispute is sharply honed and finely balanced.  With accusations between the two men and their adherents, this is no small accomplishment.  There was much to learn in a relatively new field.  The abundance of fossils from the West demanded careful study and analysis, but Cope and Marsh knew that expedition funding followed the first discoverers.  Wallace accepts this with some reservations, but condemns neither man.  With the addition of some photos and diagrams [a map would have been useful], this is an informative book and an excellent read.

Always keeping speculation in tight rein, he nevertheless exhibits a wide-ranging imagination.  His stories are always a good read, yet filled with information.  He understands the human condition, displaying that insight with a variety of characters.  Even the protagonist-narrator isn't entirely predictable.  Others, who seem understandable [but never a stereotype!], spring surprises.  He builds the episodes of this story with finesse - no small feat given the characters are 400 thousand kilometres apart.<br /><br />Jake Sullivan, scion of a Toronto brewery fortune, has a problem.  The blood vessels in his brain might unexpectedly explode.  It happened to his father during a family fight.  The result isn't terminal.  It leaves the victim in a vegetative state.  Jake decides to take advantage of a new technology to bypass the threat.  He'll have his mind scanned and his consciouness copied into an almost indestructible artificial body.  Immortality, that quest so long followed by fragile humanity, may be imminent.  His \\"shed skin\\", the original, flawed body, will be shipped to the far side of the Moon to live luxuriously until \\"natural causes\\" prevail.  The relocation abandons a lonely dog, a confused girlfriend and a concerned mother.<br /><br />As might be expected, a threat looms.  Give a lawyer an opening and another courtroom drama enfolds.  What says the law on two minds of one person?  Sawyer has done courtroom scenes before in \\"Illegal Alien\\".  He surpasses himself with this one as the concepts of consciousness are thoroughly explored by the contending sides.  Sawyer is at his best in having characters explain philosophical or scientific stances.  Thankfully, in this examination of determining who we are, Sawyer manages to shift the issue of the \\"soul\\" out of the hands of the clergy.  His defender of that concept would seem inappropriate, but the character expresses the idea fervently.<br /><br />The resolution of these issues is, amazingly, left for the reader.  Sawyer has always avoided absolutes.  He has his passions - the Toronto Blue Jays and enjoying Fate's gift of being Canadian, among others.  While those are important and worthy of admiration and satisfaction, the issue of humanity in general looms significantly in his work.  He is outstanding in dealing with controversies in a balanced narrative.  And the story line itself will keep you reading to the end.  A true \\"page-turner\\".

Whoever and wherever that was, the quest for an answer has endured.  Simon Singh traces the results of that search in very human terms.  From early creation myths through the orbiting of machines that view the universe in selected frequencies, he explains how our knowledge of the cosmos has built and changed over four long centuries.  Using an effective conversational style, he demonstrates how the slow accumulation of knowledge built our picture of the universe.  With clarity came distance in our growing perception of the age and scope of the cosmos.  After nearly fifteen billion years, the universe has had much time to expand.  Whether that will long continue is one of the points of this excellent story.<br /><br />Arranging his topics carefully, Singh ties concepts to their investigators.  Early ideas were based on \\"common sense\\" and accepted authorities.  Naked eye observation limited our ability to \\"see\\" the universe until the telescope was developed.  \\"Decentralising\\" is an ongoing theme in this book as we learn how Western Europe came to understand the Earth was not the centre of things.  Galileo's telescopic observations shifted that centre to the sun.  When telescopes improved even the sun's location moved to the edge of the Milky Way.  Singh demonstrates how each step was proposed, considered and contested, then accepted with additional data.  With hindsight, the conclusions all appear obvious.  At the time of each new concept's proposal, \\"established\\" views held sway until overwhelming evidence displaced them.<br /><br />No proposal was so hotly disputed as the notion that the cosmos began as a tiny region which rapidly expanded - the Big Bang.  Although first proposed in different terms by a Belgian priest, Georges Lemaitre, the idea of explosive beginnings of the universe were generally dismissed.  The supporting evidence was lacking and other considerations impaired its acceptance.  Not the least of these was the religious connotations arising from the idea of a \\"creation point\\".  In fact, the term \\"Big Bang\\" was a derisive term applied to the concept by one of its greatest critics, Fred Hoyle.  Hoyle, with a shifting squad of supporters, proposed a \\"Steady State\\" universe in which matter was continuously being created and annihilated.  Singh uses a handy set of comparison charts to show how evidence and the issues are balanced in the two theories.  Bound to both theses was the question of the universe's age.<br /><br />In the years following World War II, however, technology generated by that conflict provided researchers with a fresh, if previously used, tool kit.  Radio telescopy, a true product of \\"war surplus\\" equipment, led to new discoveries.  Of the many findings, the one most damaging to Hoyle's Steady State universe came from two scientists trying to reduce static in transcontinental telephone calls.  Singh's description of Penzias and Wilson combatting the homing, nesting and excretory habits of a pair of pigeons is typical of his conversational style.  It's also a paean to the dedicated researchers who persevered to complete their task.  Coupled with radio telescopy was the improvement in spectroscopy - the chemistry of stars.  Contributing new information on stellar age had the bizarre impact of clarifying and obscuring the duration of the universe's existence.<br /><br />Understanding the history of our learning the structure of the universe is one thing - grasping the physics and chemistry is quite another.  Singh's great talent is being able to convey both with equal facility and clarity.  He knows how to summarize without losing meaning.  The \\"sketches\\" concluding each chapter are visual summaries that might have been his composing notes.  The bibliography is useful, but with the number of books on the topics, it reflects necessarily limited choices.  There are countless books on the history and physics of cosmology.  Isthis one preferable to most?  Is it more important than the others?  The answer to both questions is a vehement, if qualified, \\"Yes!\\".  To someone new to the topic, Singh has provided an informative welcome.  Does he justify his subtitle?  That remains questionable, but it's clear he's correct in asserting \\"you need to know about it\\".  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]s it more important than the others?

To one side is a broad, deep valley, a lake glistening in the morning sun.  On the other side is the sea, the wind whipping the surf against the hill.  One large wave sweeps up the beach into a cleft.  Seawater pushes over the top, cascading into the valley, 150 metres below.  Following waves enlarge the opening -  within hours there's a steady flow of seawater.  In days, the cascade is a deafening roar and the distant lake is rising 15 cm per day.  People are fleeing as villages and fields are swept away or drowned forever.  It's an event you will recount to your grandchildren.<br /><br />This is the scenario postulated by Ryan and Pitman that transpired less than seven thousand years ago.  The Ice Age, they remind us, tied up immense amonts of sea water, dropping coastlines and leaving lowlands isolated.  The cold, dry air spilling off the glaciers swept over a freshwater lake northeast of the Mediterranean Sea.  The lake evaporated faster than the rivers feeding it could replace.  Ultimately, the lake's surface was far below sea level, but the sea was restrained by a land barrier.  Once breached, the salty ocean water poured through what is now the Bosphorus to flood the lake's basin.  At its height, the flow must have been ten times that of Niagra Falls and gushed through the break at over 70 kph.  Evacuation of settlements scattered populations in many directions. The Tigris-Euphrates valley provided one major refuge.  There, people settled and the story of the great flooding would have been paramount in their legends.<br /><br />The revelation of how a flood myth became so important in the arid lands of Mesopotamia and Palestine was slow in exposure.  The authors narrate the explorations of early researchers in these areas.  Among the many revelations was that the Noachean Flood myth of the Hebrew Bible was actually taken from Babylonian sources during the Jewish Exile.  Why should a desert people have a story about the inundation of the entire world?  Ryan and Pitman relate how samples from the sea floor sediments indicate a bizarre and sudden shift in ancient sea life offered the first clues.  It took high technology to reveal the details, the authors note, but hints were visible to those who knew how to look.  Small boats still hang rock-filled nets deep into the waters of the Bosphorus because the deep, northward-flowing currents can pull small boats to the Black Sea against the surface water coming out of it.<br /><br />This is an excellent account of how scientific detective work merged with innovative thinking.  The methods of investigation are well-detailed and the analyses explained clearly.  The writers even studied the methods of passing oral traditions and how basic themes persist even when presentation style and emphasis may change.  There are excellent maps and the illustrations are \\"personalised\\" by transforming photographs into drawings.  The footnotes are page-referenced, making sources easily understood by the reader new to the topics, although a full bibliography would have enhanced the work.  Since this book was published, support for the thesis has come from the finding of human habitation deep underwater along the Turkish Black Sea coast.  On the other hand, a research team has challenged the idea of the Aegean Sea flooding the Black Sea, proposing that the process was reversed.  Such is the delightful experience of reading science!

The book isn't available in the USA, but may be ordered from the Canadian site.<br /><br />Try enlivening a party with this question: \\"What's on your mind?\\"  When the babble has become truly raucous, ask another: \\"How did it get in there?\\"  This book is about those questions, how we came to consider them, and how we've tried to learn to understand them.  Interleaving a fantasy story with analyses of scientific thinking about thinking carries certain risks.  In the hands of this trio, however, the balance is successfully achieved.  Don't be deceived by the name of Terry Pratchett as lead author of this volume.  There are wonderful touches of humour in this book, but the basic theme is a serious question:  \\"Who are we, and how did we get to be this way?\\"<br /><br />This book repeats a technique used in The Science of Discworld I - two stories in parallel.  Discworld is a mirror of Roundworld.  The wizards used the computer Hex to construct Roundworld in SoD I.  They were shocked at the many differences.  Shape was only a beginning.  They were confronted with the many ways in which life evolved on Roundworld.  They were also forced to reflect on how illogical it seemed for living things to struggle for survival, only to be snuffed out by natural forces.  In this sequel, the most advanced life form is going to be confronted with an extinction threat noted in the first book.  How to deal with it?  It turns out that the best solution is to ally with a great evil force.<br /><br />Humanity has a strange and illogical heritage, this book tells us.  As our forebears learned to cope with changing conditions on the African savannah [or on lake shores or even in the sea] they learned to stand upright, to grasp tools, and to think.  This has always seemed like a long, continuous progression of small improvements over time - a process in the best Darwinian gradualist sense.  This trio of authors reminds us that this picture is false for humans.  After a good start, our ancestors simply halted in place, keeping social, mental and technological progress at bay.  The \\"pause\\" went on for a hundred millennia.  At some point about fifty thousand years ago, all that changed.  We went from the \\"standing ape\\" to become \\"the storytelling ape\\".  Thinking and speaking resulted in story-telling.<br /><br />In trying to understand ourselves and our surroundings, Pratchett and his colleagues see humans as inventing stories for explanations of nature's mysteries.  Magic, allied with the element \\"narrativium\\", runs the Discworld.  On the Roundworld, magic has to be invented.  Narratives are the means to bring it about and spread it around.  Every human society forges its own stories which are imparted to children as \\"Make-A-Human Kits\\".  Each society creates explanations which become legends which become religions as one example.  While we might dispute whether we've \\"progressed\\" argue the authors, there's no question that once the process started, humans changed rapidly resulting in what we see around us today.  This \\"advance\\", they argue, was not inevitable.  While we may not yet understand what prompted this change, we can list alternatives and reject the impossible or implausible.  That's why the Discworld parallel story comprises part of this book.  It teaches you how to recognise the difference.<br /><br />To long-standing Discworld fans, this book will be a serious challenge.  Unlike the \\"laugh per page\\" of Pratchett's other works, he and his colleagues confront the most serious of issues: \\"where do we come from?\\" and \\"where are we going?\\".  Cohen and Stewart, who have dealt these questions elsewhere, and Terry Pratchett, who posits them with every book, have produced a significant contribution in attempting an answer.  The use of the parallel story line offers great opportunities for the reader to \\"step outside the box\\" and consider life and beliefs from a detached view.  Pratchett has long confronted us with ourselves.  Adding Cohen and Stewart's scientific and cognitive abilities to his imagination results in a compelling and informative read.

They make fascinating characters, leading the adventurous lives we dreamt of in childhood. A glance at any history of Medieval Europe shows the extent of their conquests - down the major rivers of Russia to link with their cousins in the Mediterranean. Their impact on history has been muted or misinterpreted often, usually due to their attacks on Christian establishments and their vacillating attachment to \\"The Faith\\". Their seafaring and conquering talents have not faded, however. They are the stuff of legend, even when the forays failed.<br /><br />In this first volume of a Norse trilogy, Severin tries to cover some of the \\"millennium\\" events the Norse undertook. Greenland, an exile's enclave is one of many homes of Thorgils, [...] son of Leif Ericsson. It hasn't been settled long, and opportunities abound for the adventurous. His mother, a powerful woman of Irish descent, leaves her son some inexplicable powers. The mix of Celt and Norse was too tempting for Severin to skip, and it provides his character with a multitude of story events to encounter. It also prompts Thorgils to extensive travels. One of those jaunts takes him where few Norse-inspired novelists dare to venture - Canada's Atlantic Provinces. \\"Vinland\\", long a place of mystery to European chroniclers, has been revealed as truly a Norse settlement site. Severin takes advantage of this with a fighting tour of the region. Thorgils witnesses these events up close, but not as closely as will later clashes.<br /><br />After some interludes, Thorgils embarks on his own quest - find his roots. He wants to learn of his mother and his other family. In Medieval Ireland, that's not only difficult, it may prove sadly unrewarding. Thorgils endures the usual vicissitudes of a young man without a protector in those turbulent times. Warfare, wanderings, captures and escapes. He falls in adolescent love [he reaches nineteen years in this volume - which is why there'll have to be two more], but life is full of various disappointments. Love must wait at least until volume two. There are mysteries to encounter and resolve, enigmatic people to deal with and a great question that must someday be confronted. What to do about the Christians?<br /><br />While Thorgils must confront or deal with many people in his young life, the background antagonist to the young Norseman is the White Christ. In the first millennium year, the dominance of Norse society by Christianity was far from a given. Odinn had set an example for young men such as Thorgils. Odinn, crucified on a tree, suffered unendurable agonies for the reward of wisdom. Wisdom, as any fantasy reader will assure you, is far more desirable than material or martial power. Thorgils begins to understand this as he moves between events. Power is transitory, but wisdom persists. And the wisdom of the Old Ways retains great appeal to certain members of Norse society. Will Thorgils join that company?<br /><br />Severin's offering to this rising genre regrettably doesn't add much that's novel. His characters are already drawn from formula. Since the tale is told from Thorgils' viewpoint, we don't learn why a people who had been surrounded by powerful deities should have turned to one so alien to their traditions - although this is central to the plot. It's clear that one powerful chieftain, converted to the White Christ, could force dependents along the same path. Blind adherence to authority wasn't a Norse trait. There were rebellions that Severin, at least in this volume, coolly overlooks. He grants Thorgils a human identity, perhaps even a valid Norse one. So many events in this book, however, are so glaringly predictable, it becomes a page-turner just to get past them unscorched.

In sometimes wonderfully lyrical language, Boffa recounts Viskovitz' quest for his true love, \\"Ljuba\\" and the turmoils and travails this multiple personality must endure.<br /><br />Biologists know all animal life [and perhaps a few plants!] is driven by the \\"Five Fs\\" - Feed, Fear, Fight, Flight and . . . er . . . reproduction.  Boffa rearranges the queue to put the last up front.  As twenty different species, not all of them definably male, Viskovitz uses every opportunity to continue the line.  His quest to mate, especially with the love of his choice, consumes him in each guise.  His sense of mission may seem extreme to some, but the tales clearly represent what has been learned from studying life.  Boffa recounts the many rituals various species go through in attracting mates.  Africa's dung beetle Viskovitz goes beyond mere collecting and posturing.  He becomes a monopolistic entrepreneur, determined to overwhelm any competition in his desire to win the beetle Ljuba.  The resolution of that courtship is a priceless example of what \\"diversity of life\\" truly means.  Identity may be hidden in some remote aspect of an organism.<br /><br />Ljuba, primary object of desire, isn't the only influence on Viskovitz' life.  There is Zucotic, who might be Viskovitz' alter ego.  There's Lara, who may play substitute for the elusive Ljuba.  In one case, the delightful Ljuba is replaced by a new, even more attractive mate, who happens to be a cardboard cutout.  And, there's Viskovitz' relationship with his own parents, who- and what-ever they may be.  Antecedents, as in any family, bear strong influence on how the current generation behaves and what they might expect.  Inquiring about what his departed father was like, he's informed: \\"Crunchy, a bit salty, rich in fibre\\" by his preying mantis mother.  Gender identity is vague among some creatures, and Viskovitz' relations with snail and sponge families makes delightful reading.  But, so does the whole book.

This immediately leads to a more perplexing question: \\"What is consciousness?\\".  With the concept still but vaguely defined in human terms, asking it of the other animals evokes a host of difficulties.  Hauser, to his credit, makes a worthwhile attempt to deal with both questions.  In this sweeping survey, he declares that simplistic approaches to how the various primates deal with life are misplaced.  There is a range of animal awareness out there, shaped by the forces of natural selection.  Each species must be studied carefully and intensively, both in controlled and wild conditions.  And the work, he insists, has barely started.<br /><br />He combines his field experience with the work of many researchers in revealing facets of consciousness.  Hauser's study was stimulated by a young monkey giving him a hug.  He calls these elements \\"mental tool kits\\".  By this he explains that similar conditions generate similar responses in the animal.  This suggests there are probably areas in the brain common across many species.  When conditions change, however, the response may vary wildly, indicating dissimilarity in capacity.  A startling contrast is the range of food storage sites among different species.  A dog may bury a bone in the garden, but a Clark's Nutcracker can stash up to thirty thousand seeds in six thousand locations - and find most of them the following Spring.  Hauser calls this ability \\"cognitive mapping\\" - a special talent derived over long evolutionary time.  Other animals have the role of \\"space travelers\\", although Clark's must hold some kind of record.<br /><br />\\"Self-awareness\\" is an all-encompassing term.  In the largest and most significant part of the book, Hauser dodges the vague, but common, phrase, replacing it with \\"self-recognition\\".  This term is a more measurable aspect of cognition.  Experiments with mirrors demonstrate that some primates know who they're looking at, while others see intruders or remain indifferent.  Strangely, some birds seem to recognise themselves in reflected images.  Expressing self-awareness means communicating.  For us, that's done with speech or writing.  With other creatures, other forms of expression must be inferred from observation.  Deception is a commonly used test.  An animal aware of itself, and aware of others as well, is likely to derive the other's intent.  When another's intention can be directed, and the deceiver gains from that guiding, individuality seems enhanced.  How far we can take such analyses is one of  Hauser's calls for more research.<br /><br />Language and thought are far too closely aligned in the minds of most researchers, Hauser believes.  That link restricts \\"real\\" thoughts to those that can express them in words - in short, only humans.  Hauser counters that thought is something we can interpret from actions - and the greater the variance in action, the better.  He looks back at our evolutionary beginnings through the eyes of today's primates.  Thought, he argues was there - language was a gloss that came later.  The implication is that researchers need to try fresh approaches to studying how \\"wild minds\\" can be better understood.  The result is the growth of a new discipline, cognitive ethology which encompasses a wide range of species who have, or might possess, thoughts we can identify.  This book is a major step in furthering that new field.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]know who they're looking at, while others see intruders or remain indifferent.

Their aim is stamping down the idea that genes are the root of life's processes.  They rail against \\"reductionist science\\", while extolling life's \\"marvels\\" and \\"mysterious\\" attainments.  It's a curious phenomenon, sometimes comprehensible in its aims, but always flawed in its foundation.  The theme counters \\"the narrowly focussed and reductionist science\\", although those holding such views remain nameless.  Franklin Harold is a member of this swarm, and this book is one attempt to lift the \\"meaning of life\\" to some perceived \\"higher plane\\".  The result is a highly informative description of cellular structures and processes.<br /><br />Harold's method is at least shorn of the polemics used by some of his colleagues.  He wants us to understand that Schrodinger's great question, \\"What Is Life?\\" has an evident response.  \\"Note the birds and the butterflies\\", if you truly want to know about life, Harold urges.  To him, life is something to be celebrated, to have \\"meaning\\".  His view, then, is limited to the individual organism, even if it's a micro-organism.  Cells, he advises, offer a view of life providing a grandeur of its own.  Micro-organisms, he stresses repeatedly, have been overlooked or poorly considered in recent years.  With this book he seeks to restore them to their proper place in science's realm.  In doing so, he attempts to detach Darwinian natural selection from the processes that form cellular structures.  He comes dangerously close to proposing the steps in building a cell cannot be derived.  They are too complex and generated by processes not linked to the replication process of DNA itself.<br /><br />Harold's model cell is the famous [or infamous, depending on your digestive health] Eschericaria coli, resident of your gastro-intestinal tract.  He even offers a detailed \\"recipe\\" of what comprises this bacterium with an illustration of its innards.  In explaining some of the complex activities present in this bacterium, he offers a new concept to biology - the field.  Admitting up front that such an ephemeral process will seem alien to biologists and physicists alike, he offers it as an explanation for the paths he fails to find leading back to the genome.  While he struggles to give status to his idea, the reader can only wonder at Harold's evident desperation in offering it.  That we don't yet know all the steps that a cell's DNA initiates to accomplish building an organism is hardly justification for such a flimsy thesis.  Again, he is but one step from the supernatural, although avidly denying the charge.<br /><br />In conclusion, Harold lopes back in time to examine some of the theses addressing life's origins.  He rightly offers this as science's primary issue.  Accepting that life \\"arose from inanimate matter\\", he synopsizes the evidence and considers the theories.  Stanley Miller's \\"soup\\" is described, and Christian de Duve's \\"proto-metabolic web\\" is examined.  He gives Cairns Smith's clay template for building replicating molecules a brief phrase, then considers Gunter Wachtershauser's foundation of iron pyrites at some length.  He doesn't admire any of them, because they bring him too close to what he wishes to avoid - if we understand the simple beginnings, then we can assess how complexity arose.  Since Harold can't accept any of them, we are left with our own preference, or none.<br /><br />In building his case against a \\"biochemical view of life\\", Harold provides a wealth of exquisite detail about cells.  Enhancing this catalog of cell parts and mechanisms are some fine diagrams, some derived from microphotographs.  Each of the complex images provides valuable information even the specialist will find useful.  Harold's \\"References\\" is an impressive list at first glance, but a close look reveals some unwarrented gaps.  The book is worth a close reading [or more!], but must not be allowed to stand alone.  Because it can't. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]can't. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]	2005-03-31

If much work has been done in the ensuing years, a complete rewrite is usually in order.  Too few results can fail to justify the reprise.  Fagan's original effort on the peopling of the Western Hemisphere was an excellent survey.  This edition is essentially that first account, with an explanatory chapter inserted at the beginning of the book.  That technique has the advantage of warning the reader what to look for while going through the text.  And while much new information has come into view, Fagan reminds us that the underlying questions about where \\"Native Americans\\" originated, and when, remain unanswered.<br /><br />The human diaspora begins in Africa, some five million years ago according to Fagan - [recent finds emerged too late to appear here].  Unique among migratory species, Homo sapiens sapiens moved in but one direction.  From our origins on the savannah, the author traces our path into north-eastern Asia.  When conditions permitted, glacial ice having trapped enough water to reduce sea levels some 300 metres, these ancient Asians moved onto a lost continent now named \\"Berengia\\".  This link between Asia and North America must retain evidence of human occupation, but retrieval from the sea bottom is difficult.  Fagan describes the intense research into climatology, palynology and other fields to explain how the data has been accumulated over many years.<br /><br />Hidden evidence provides opportunities for speculation and controversy and the studies of ancient Americans is rife with both.  Fagan describes what research has revealed and reviews the suppositions drawn from the scattered and inconclusive evidence.  Fagan examines the various theories of when humans entered the Americas and what dispersal paths they followed.  He lists the dig sites with the opinions derived from the evidence, weighing the contending arguments with care and a considered detachment.  Where dating is flawed or suspect, he resists ill-considered judgment, calling for further investigation.  A few anomalous sites, such as Monte Verde in Chile and Meadowcroft in Pennsylvania receive extra attention.  He's quick to praise diligent methods while readily disparaging hasty proclamations.  The Pedra Furada site in Brazil, once extolled as \\"challenging ideas on the First Americas\\", is given a lengthy description, but is dismissed as poorly investigated and reported.  As Fagan notes, tracing the movements of humanity in ancient times is a detective's work, with clues assessed only with extreme care.<br /><br />Some points of contention the author passes over with summary evaluation.  After his presentation of Paul Martin's thesis that the disappearance of large mammals was due to human predation, Fagan dismisses it.  Climate shift, he states, changed the nature of plant life leaving these prey species bereft of fodder.  Yet Tim Flannery, in two books published since the original edition of Great Journey, demonstrates that browsing and grazing species would have adapted to climate change.  The timing of human occupation and megafauna extinction is too proximate to be ignored.  The prime example of Maori hunting of moa species in New Zealand is symptomatic and well documented.  Martin may have been wrong in details, but his basic thesis has withstood criticism.<br /><br />These flaws don't negate the exceptional worth of Fagan's achievement in this study.  It's a powerful and informative narrative of Western Hemispheric archaeology, its practitioners and their results.  Starting with early views of the first European invaders, he explains how improved scholarship, better technology and disciplined approaches have clarified the picture of Native American life.  Fagan provides photographs and maps for additional support of the text.  This remains a valuable book, easily read and understood.  It has not been replaced and will keep its well-earned reputation.

It's as insidious as any virus, with a virulent core protected by a sheath of sanctity and the illusion of \\"fair play\\".  The infective kernel is Christianity and the shell it resides in is \\"intelligent design\\".  The religious campaign to oust or discredit science, in particular evolutionary biology, has a long history in the United States.  Almost unique among nations, the United States has constitutional provisions, and a long trail of legal decisions, against religious intrusion in public education.  Having been defeated in many arenas, a new Christian movement, cloaking itself in \\"scientific\\" mufti, has emerged with a long-term strategy for infesting public education.  The movement champions something called \\"intelligent design\\" and its avowed strategy is \\"the Wedge\\".<br /><br />The \\"Wedge\\", as shown in this intense and deeply penetrating survey, is a well-organised, well-funded campaign.  From its Discovery Institute headquarters, it unleashes waves of propaganda in the form of books, \\"research studies\\", videos and circuit-riding preachers of the gospel of anti-Darwinism.  The authors trace the origins of the movement from the original \\"wedge\\" document, follow its campaigns into classrooms, school boards and even the US Congress, demonstrating the motivation is religious, not scientific.  While they give much attention to the \\"big names\\" of ID, Behe, Dempski, Johnson and Wells, they leave no stone unturned in revealing the population of creatures underneath willing to challenge Darwin as \\"immoral\\" or \\"materialist\\".<br /><br />The authors trace the transformation from \\"Christian creationism\\" to \\"scientific creationism\\" [sic] to \\"intelligent design\\"[sic!].  They explain the \\"philosophy\\" behind the movement, while reminding us that not a single scientific paper either proposing or explaining \\"intelligent design\\" has ever been published.  What has been published is limited to \\"popular\\" works by the four \\"big names\\", all of which have been devastatingly refuted by professionals in their various fields.  Some of the refutations are contained in the main text, but the treasure in this book is the extensive \\"Notes\\" section at the back of the book.  However much attention you give the body of this volume, be prepared to spend at least equal time there.  After examining the elements making up this mockery of science, the authors relate how it has manifested in various States.<br /><br />Reading this account of the buildup of a campaign to overturn not only US education, but the entire society, can be tedious.  The repetition of hypocrisies, flagrant opportunism and deception can weary the reader.  One can only sympathise deeply with these two authors who forced themselves to troll the polluted waters of ID to bring you this litany of potential disaster to schooling.  Their conclusion rests on the usually camouflaged but often clearly expressed declarations of \\"wedge\\" campaigners that this is a religious crusade.

311616:US	50941451	RXVQGJJCCPZ47	1896219004	852159147	Canoeing a Continent: On the Trail of Alexander Mackenzie	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Paddling, personality and persistence	Over a decade before those icons of Manifest Destiny, Lewis and Clark, finally camped on Pacific shores, Scots fur trader Alexander Mackenzie had already crossed the entire North American continent.  Mackenzie's traverse prompted President Jefferson's counter with the government employees' well-equipped expedition.  Mackenzie had undertaken the journey at his own initiative.  Likewise, Max Finkelstein suddenly convinced himself it would be a fine idea to duplicate, as far as he might, the traverse Mackenzie made at the end of the 18th Century.  Due to time constraints, Finkelstein had to follow Mackenzie's track in stages over several years.  This book is an account of those expeditions.<br /><br />The opening chapters portraying Mackenzie's journeys and more recent continental crossings reveal the immensity of the task.  Finkelstein then describes his personal crises, an aged mother and his own doubts, as he prepares [with a list of equipment at the back of the book], then is blocked from launching by Ottawa River Valley weather.  Once under way, he imparts his successes and challenges with deep feeling.  It's a wonderfully descriptive, evocative story of a man almost driven to explore Canada's river and lake systems.  Max is helped, coaxed, encouraged, frustrated and elated by turns.  You are with him at every portage; you share his joys and illnesses; you feel his rapture at being on Canada's rivers.  Mostly, you gain some insight as to what kept both Mackenzie and Finkelstein going as they sought the vast Pacific shore.<br /><br />It's easy to disparage the modern canoeist, particularly one on such an immense, but well-planned, journey.  Finkelstein carries a GPS locating device, video recording equipment, Kraft Dinners [TM] and even \\"Sir Alex\\", a Teddy Bear, for good luck.  With modern conveniences, friends who provide dinners and showers, getting a lift over crossings in a ute, it's clear he's not portaging into the past.  That wasn't his intent.  Finkelstein wanted to see, so far as possible, what Mackenzie saw.  He succeed and imparts his observations in a readable and truly captivating account.  Along the way, he gently reminds us that GPS devices and Kraft Dinners fade into obscurity when you're alone in a Lake Superior storm or shooting rapids down the Blackwater River in British Columbia.  Then, Finkelstein is every bit the man the Scots explorer was and deserves much credit for his endeavours - and his narrative of the adventure.

The ancient Greeks applied the term \\"Keltai\\" to the peoples living north of their peninsula.  They described them as \\"barbarians\\" which originally meant \\"outsider\\" or \\"foreigner\\".  The meaning of \\"barbarian\\" changed over the centuries, especially when the Roman Empire's expansion was checked by these ancient people and Caesar became a propagandist in his campaigns against them.  He admired their courage and fighting abilities, but disparaged nearly every other aspect of their culture.  And his depiction persisted for centuries.<br /><br />In an outstanding brief overview, Ellis provides a corrective to that portrayal.  We learn the Celts have Indo-European roots reaching into deep time.  We also learn all those centuries allowed the Celts to achieve high cultural attainments in society, urban development and the arts.  Oh, yes.  They also successfully defeated nearly every force sent against them.  Only a long war of attrition plus a few renegade leaders turned defectors ultimately led to Rome's overrunning them.  Which didn't destroy their culture.  It took the Christians to achieve that.<br /><br />In describing Celtic society, Ellis frequently reminds us that these \\"first Europeans\\" had no written records.  In large part, this lack was due to the prohibition of religious matters being set down in writing.  Their leading intellectual class, the Druids, who had a far larger role than chanting in oak forests, maintained a detailed oral tradition.  Not until the Christians came among them were any of their legends committed to parchment, and those, in Ellis' words were \\"bowdlerised\\" versions, designed to transform Celtic historical and mythical figures into the Christian mythology.<br /><br />Ellis guides us through the metaphysical and concrete aspects of Celtic life.  Gods proliferated, with countless local deities, but some which appear to be common across their areas of occupation.  The Celts had a strong sense of the human soul, which they knew resided in the head, not in the stomach of Greek philosophy.  The Christian Trinity, not \\"officially\\" promulgated until Nicea, may have originated with ideas derived through a Celtic bishop a century before the \\"Creed\\".  Kings and warriors played their roles, but the Celts had a highly talented artisan class.  While swords were significantly superior for their time, they also produced superb jewellry and other artefacts.  Their technology, going far beyond weaponry, included a strong use of glass and enamelling techniques.  They built strong houses and castles, expanding some sites into major urban centres.  While the libel against them has persisted, so have many of their ideas, words and deities.  As Ellis has attempted to do with this book, a better balance needs to be struck.

Limiting the parameters to \\"literary\\" aspects is hardly a pruning - even when historical elements are essentially stripped away.  Alter and Kermode saved themselves some of the labour by farming out much of the analysis required for this job.  The result is a collection of essays readable only in selected bits.  The variety of approaches will perplex the reader experienced in biblical analysis.  The newcomer, however, who perseveres with patience and a willingness to consult other resources, will find the full scope of the collection a worthwhile investment.<br /><br />Selecting authors for these essays must have been daunting.  They should each be familiar with the books and with the essentials of literary criticism.  It's said that \\"anyone can be a critic\\", but approaching books held in such awe and reverence by large segments of the population takes a certain level of finesse.  Most of these authors exhibit that capability.  Alter and Kermode note that they don't demand \\"uniformity of style\\" in the entries, but the approach is uniformly constrained, but not narrow.  The essays are not buried in arcane literary movements, such as structuralism, feminism or post-modernism, which were prevalent when this book was published.  Alter and Kermode, in their introductory essays, acknowledge these movements, but they and most of the authors return to more a classical framework in their analyses.  This approach is likely motivated by the use of the King James Version, with which most of their readers have at least passing familiarity.<br /><br />The KJV foundation, however, restricts much of the appeal of this collection to Protestant Christianity.  Anything else would be chaotic, but the reader may find a few authors use circular reasoning as they attempt to retrieve literary elements.  It becomes \\"what is said, was said\\".  The KJV, at a midpoint between biblical events and modern times, presents an atmosphere out of joint with the subjects dealt with.  The editors caution the reader about this, but once past their introductory comments the individual authors strive, sometimes successfully, to place occurrences in a proper frame of reference.  Omitting the historical environment tends to make the literary analyses fragile and incomplete.  It limits \\"literary\\" aspects to what the modern reader can understand and utterly omits what a reader of the times might perceive.  How would people of that era have viewed the various stories and the characters they portray?<br /><br />The editors make a final attempt to preserve the historical framework in a half-dozen general essays that conclude the book.  These writings address the issues of assembling the books into a \\"canon\\" - the establishment of the books into a voice of authority - biblical poetry and the impact of Greco-Roman writing techniques and use of accepted mythologies in that world.

To him, revealing those underlying aspects of The Books will provide society with a better grasp of what it believes.  He hopes that by enlarging the knowledge of the roots of belief, such tragedies as the assassination of Itzak Rabin or the destruction of the World Trade Center might be avoided.  If the origins are understood, perhaps the fallacies can be stripped away.  With a view unclouded by myth and/or fixed vision imparted by authorities, the historical antecedents of biblical writings are clearly shown.  With that clarity may come a new way of regarding the worth of the Anthology's contents.  In this well-written and careful overview, Callahan offers insights into the foundations of Judeo-Christian mythology.<br /><br />Callahan reminds us that the home of the biblical writers was an integrated part of Near Eastern society.  Trade routes crisscrossed the Levant, often followed by conquering or retreating armies.  Sometimes, whole populations were uprooted and displaced.  The result, he contends, is a blending of peoples, their legends and beliefs.  Teachings on matters practical and divine were introduced, tried, accepted or replaced.  It's not surprising the phrase \\"There's nothing new under the sun\\" originated there - there was an intense exchange of ideas and information.  Some of the ideas were incorporated by scribes belonging to a subset of the peoples living near the Mediterranean shore - the Jews.<br /><br />In explaining the sources of biblical myth, the author essentially follows the sequence of the books laid down by Protestant clerics.  In the second part of the collection he even cites Matthew prior to Mark, although the latter's writing preceded the former by two generations.  Throughout the text, from Genesis onward, Callahan shows how earlier legends of other peoples were incorporated by biblical writers and editors into the texts.  He shows how societies older than the Palestinian peoples the Jews emerged from contributed to the Jewish creation myth, their romantic escapades and their forays into monotheism.  They also appear to have imitated the division of authority into a visible ruler buttressed by hidden coteries of priest-scribes.  These latter were the knowledgeable scholars who transformed commonly believed mythologies into something unique for the subject population.<br /><br />Callahan recognises that reassessment of biblical origins is of more concern among Christians than the Jewish faithful.  He shows how fundamentalist Christian commentators in the USA bend and twist the myths to suit a local agenda.  This is not a widespread movement, no matter how loud its protestations of \\"authenticity\\", he notes.  His technique recounts how the myth is viewed today, how it was likely dealt with by the Jewish scribes and from where they derived it in other peoples' legends.  \\"Authenticity\\" is thus smeared thinly over stretches of time and location, rendering \\"origins\\" a vague notion.<br /><br />The author has taken a variety of sources in compiling this study, including ancient writings, monuments, archaeological finds and text analysis.  For the \\"serious\\" bible student, it's an excellent starting point in understanding how the stories have evolved over time.  He is a clear writer, using some good graphic material to enhance the relationships he builds.  A worthwhile read for anyone interested in how myths are built from early sources.

Not long ago, the idea that babies are born \\"mentally malleable\\" was thought to have been laid to rest.  Richard Nisbett has granted the idea a conditional resurrection with this book.  Instead of culture being but a gloss over what evolution granted our cognitive skills, it is the foundation on which thinking rests.  In a significant study of East-West cultural differences, he finds a deep cleavage between them.  Easterners, he argues, show a marked propensity for an holistic outlook - seeing environments before details and fitting individuals within a group.  Westerners, with an interest in the more specific, elevate the individual and focus on details over context.  Although these differences are exemplified by Confucius' teachings in the East and Aristotle in the West, they are by no means the founders of the attitudes.  Indeed, according to Nisbett, the roots of this dichotomy reach deeply into the past.<br /><br />Western notions, he argues, derive from a Greek ideal of \\"personal agency\\".  The individual might live in city or farm, but his actions and voice were unique.  They also originated the investigation of nature's workings - a process that would culminate in today's usurpation of the environment.  Individuals contested their ideas publicly, a process reflected in such diverse environments as politics and science.  Ideas are \\"testable\\" for validity and utility.<br /><br />In the East, particularly in Confucian China, the underlying theme is \\"harmony\\".  For the individual, that's reflected in submergence within the group, whether family or corporation.  Disputes aren't resolved by debate, but by mediation, often by a third party.  Where Americans, Nesbitt says, use confrontation, even litigation, to resolve issues, the East finds a Middle Way.  He finds graphic expression of this in the fact that there are forty times more lawyers per capita in the United States than in Japan!<br /><br />Nesbitt bases his contentions on several years of study of both cultural areas.  He incorporates the work of other researchers [although no cognitive scientists are cited] who have investigated both cultures.  The studies have consistently demonstrated how Eastern and Western cultures view themselves, other cultures and education.  The last is of some significance as many students from Eastern societies have been educated in Western nations.  What impact, he asks, is this type of exchange likely to have on cultural diversity.<br /><br />Nesbitt's study concludes with the two modern expressions of the future of cultural diversity.  Almost no other modern works on the future of humanity could be as diametrically opposed as Fukuyama's \\"end of history\\" thesis and Huntington's \\"clash of civilisations\\".  Francis Fukuyama's proposal that \\"democratic capitalism\\" will expand without limit, bringing the world under the hegemony of the \\"free market\\", and by default, making humanity \\"american\\" in thought and practice, has been challenged by many.  The greatest of these challengers is Samuel Huntington, who contends that the peoples not immediately benefitting from the \\"free market's\\" blessings will resist its encroachments, even by force when all else fails.  Nesbitt, a consummate optimist, thinks that the increasing mobility of the world's populace will turn this dialectic into a synthesis of merged outlooks.<br /><br />How likely this Middle Way of Nesbitt's is to be achieved is moot.  Recent activities in the Near East by Western powers suggest this book needs wider exposure.  How deeply these traits are ingrained in the cognitive makeup of two major human populations is also moot.  His own research, which prompts his own Middle Way, is shown by the reactions of Easterners and Westerners spending time in each other's environment - especially in school.  But no more than the first steps have been taken.  It requires both societies to recognise the differences before the mediation can be accomplished.

The prose must address a wide spectrum of viewers' knowledge levels.  The authors must neither insult nor overwhelm the viewer/reader.  Tyson and Goldsmith have achieved that fine balance with this book.  It provides a wealth of information about the origins and progress of the universe since its inception at the Big Bang.  Tackling an amazingly complex subject, the authors break it down into a well-organised set of topics.  Each step takes the reader into a more specific area of interest starting with what can be inferred about the earliest moments of the universe to the formation of planets.<br /><br />Cosmology, even written for television, is a massive subject to impart.  The range of subjects runs from immense forces to the minuscule movements of subatomic particles.  The authors start at the smallest, but most powerful point - the time at which the entire universe was the size of a pinhead.  From that initial condition, where all space and time were combined in a furiously energetic pellet, the authors follow the universe as it expands and cools.  Black holes form and disappear, smudges of material begin to coalesce and the universe begins to display some patterns.  Galaxies give birth to stars and planets appear where possible.<br /><br />In depicting the events and conditions of universe building, the authors provide defining, useful explanations of many phenomena.  The issue of \\"multiple universes\\" has gained many adherents in theoretical physics and cosmology.  Because their very nature precludes observing them, the ranks of critics of the concept are about as equally swollen.  \\"Dark matter\\", that mysterious material that would explain why things aren't moving about in the manner originally formulated, is clarified [at last!] well.  Keeping math at bay in this book, the authors instead explain the concepts of how dark matter's influence was recognised and what efforts have been attempted to detect it.  It's interesting at this point to note a dark matter galaxy has been recently identified.<br /><br />From a topic as seemingly esoteric as dark matter, the authors turn to the more familiar.  Stellar and planetary formation result from the accretion of material.  Learning that this material is \\"dust\\" may give a few pause.  This isn't the stuff under the divan, but much finer, assembled from but a few elements in the form of complex molecules.  Clouds of this minuscule material may form a disc, leading to the heavier bits selecting locations and sweeping up nearby material.  In the densest centre, enough material may initiate stellar ignition.  Further out, little lumps combine, build and form planets.  If you ask astronomers the details of the process, say the authors, \\"they can only gesticulate\\" - a new expression replacing \\"shrug their shoulders\\".<br /><br />Shrewd expressions such as this permeate this book, making it a lively read.  Quarks endure \\"shotgun\\" marriages and gravity \\"wriggles loose\\" from Planck matter.  To some this \\"dumbs down\\" the findings of years of studious effort.  To the reader new to these ideas, it smoothes the path to understanding.  If you are new to cosmology, the origin of our universe and what conditions allowed us to inhabit a piece of it and ask all these questions, this book is a treasure to read and keep.  Many of these issues will continue to be examined in the coming years.  With a bit of effort, you may become one of the names in a later edition.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]to detect it.

The great structure of Christianity rests on four books.  Four men, living at different times and in different places, each implying they were present during Jesus' travels and travails, penned their accounts of his life.  From these narratives, dogmas were set and an orthodoxy established that has lasted for two millennia.  When closely examined, these stories proved to have been written long after Jesus had died.  What happened in the ensuing years?<br /><br />According to Mack, after Jesus died [or disappeared], followers of this teacher formed \\"study groups\\" centred in Galilee and southern Syria.  They devised sayings attributed to the teacher, exchanged texts, debated meanings, and discussed what they felt significant about his pronouncements.  Analysis of the four books revealed some of these writings buried within the larger story.  Excavated from the Gospels, these \\"Q\\" writings have marginalised the \\"historical\\" role of the four books.  There must have been many versions of \\"Q\\" composed by the members of what Mack calls the \\"Jesus groups\\".  Whether they were ever collated into a single document will likely never be known, but it's clear the \\"gospel\\" writers were aware of them and utilised them.<br /><br />Resting much of his presentation on the work of John Kloppenborg, Mack shows the likely development of the Q writings in a solid historical setting.  With Hellenistic scholars setting the norms for education and intellectual discourse, it's easy to see how the \\"Q\\" sayings were formulated.  A glance at the social upheavals of the period reveals the environment that caused them to be written.  Mack weaves these threads together effectively to produce a vivid picture of the times and the course the writings followed as events unfolded.  It's arguable that the existence of Jesus was of less importance than the destruction of the temple.  Yet, both events would lead to revised views of the world.  The later Q documents lay the foundations for an apocalyptic view enlarged by the quartette that followed.<br /><br />Mack is an effective and concerned writer.  He's disdainful of fallacies, particularly transparent ones.  The \\"Gospels\\", he shows, are largely fabrications.  If there was a virgin birth, why did that notion not appear until nearly a century had passed?  Why are there differing accounts of those pivotal events, the crucifixion and \\"resurrection\\"?  According to Mack, these are the building blocks of Christian mythology.  He insists this myth be examined on the same basis as any other myth.  He contends if Christians wish to know their founder, a study of the \\"Q\\" writings is the starting point.  The role played by the gospels as history must be abandoned and a more realistic approach taken.  Perhaps, he stresses, returning to these \\"beginnings\\" might help alleviate the dogmas and intolerances the long, sordid history of Christianity has exhibited.

First, the notion that one source accounts entirely for Christian origins must be dismissed.  Second, a new theory of religion, one based on social situations must be launched.  This theory must take into account the conditions in which Christian origins emerged.  Third, and most difficult to address, is the need to contemplate the \\"two millennium sweep of Christianity and into the 21st century\\".  This triplet means shedding the self-reflexive approach that has dominated biblical scholarship for 1700 years.  We need, he says, to understand the process of social formation and myth making that underlay the foundation of building a church.  Scholars must abandon the \\"notions of divine intervention miracle\\" which is such a significant source of how Christians view the world.  Instead, the same academic rigour shown in investigations of other mythologies must be applied to the Christian one.<br /><br />A major element long omitted from Christian origins scholarship is the upheavals Eastern Mediterranean society endured.  The Jews, never victorious in wars and subjected to incessant invasions and exiles, were amenable to a healer's voice.  Jesus, who probably lived, became the focus of scattered and disparate groups of \\"students\\" recording, discussing and distributing his teachings.  Essential to understanding Christian origins are the documents known as the \\"Q\\" teachings.  These may have survived for a time as a collection, but incorporated into the Synoptic Gospels in various ways.  Fundamental in this process, Mack proposes, is the redefinition of society found in these writings.  The redefinition uses four devices to accomplish its goal.  He calls them the \\"Building Blocks of a Monocratic Mythology\\".<br /><br />The one god.  Since single ancestral gods are almost a human universal, the transformation of one of these into one, absolute and uncompromising, deity was a major innovation.  While the Jews had adopted, and sometimes cast aside, a variety of deities in their history, the writers of the Synoptic gospels declared such indulgent practices unacceptable.  Now, using the figure of Jesus as an instrument to lever a local concept into a global one - a new, absolute  divinity acting as a canopy over all people.  This approach set off the expansion of intolerance unfinished today.  Mack declares this monocratic method \\"audacious\\" in scope.<br /><br />In order to further the idea of restructuring society as a divine manifestation, the gospel narratives added the fictions of miracles and resurrection to the earlier \\"Q\\" teachings.  By building on widely known stories of \\"kings' sons\\" performing prodigious feats, the gospel writers display their knowledge of their intended audiences.  Nothing truly innovative was introduced beyond the idea that this god and his son were actually one.  The one being the universal deity, however, placed it in a position of universal judge of all humanity.  Mack finds the amalgamation and use of miracles as \\"proof\\" a \\"fantastic\\" stroke of creative writing.<br /><br />As the various Jesus groups debated just what Jesus said, and what those sayings meant, they exchanged ideas among the neighbouring ones.  These \\"schools of Jesus\\", which crossed the recognised cultural boundaries of the Near East, became \\"communities\\" of commonly-held views.  Having moved \\"outside\\" their traditional allegiances, these communities generated a new \\"superstate\\".  As the gospel narratives were circulated among its \\"citizens\\" a new social structure, which Mack labels \\"imperious\\" emerged within the Roman Imperium.<br /><br />Finally, and to Mack clearly a major consideration, the bible narratives became the tool for completing the social restructuring.  It became, he says, \\"an epic charter\\" by rewriting history while redefining society.  The Jewish bible was transformed into a collection of forecasts of Jesus arrival.  At the same time it condemned the Jews for not reading the signals.  This allowed the Jesus movement to abandon its Jewish roots and embrace the Gentile community.  The use of textual form granted credibility to this approach.  Christian writers were then able to define history to suit their agenda.  By declaring their history the only true one, they used this fiction as a bludgeon for conversion.  Mack's assessment of this technique as \\"arrogant\\" is impossible to refute.<br /><br />At this point, Mack narrows his audience to citizens of his own country.  How does the myth building process of Christianity apply to people of the United States?  He provides a brief swift summary of expressions of the bits of the Christian myth.  This is followed by how it has been applied there. Tracing its roots is difficult, since the Enlightenment, not Christianity, is usually seen as the more significant influence.  Mack contends the Enlightenment idea was \\"reconceptualised\\" by the North Americans, incorporating long-established traditions into the new communities from the outset.  Thus, Christianity was considered an essential element in North American society as it expanded.  Public policy is declared, whether or not the assertion is valid, as grounded in \\"Christian principles\\".  Mack exposes the fallacies in that declaration, from the theft of the land from indigenous peoples through the hypocrisies of slavery to \\"manifest destiny\\".  Mack concludes with the warning that the Christian call for conversion and obedience is invalid in today's \\"multiethnic, multicultural world\\".  It's a caution that needs wide expression and acceptance.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]o a collection of forecasts of Jesus arrival.

See Max glance forlornly at his paddling partner, Jim Stone.  Hear Max exclaiming, &quot;We're lost!  And we haven't left the house yet!&quot;  It's easy to sympathise with Max Finkelstein's distress.  He and Stone have set themselves a daunting task.  They intend following the path of one of Canada's &quot;iron men&quot;, A. P. Low, who explored the vastness of Northern Quebec at the end of the 19th Century.  Adding to the usual problems of preparations for the journey, the vagaries of Canadian sub-Arctic weather, and the endless supply of stinging or biting insects, the pair face one condition Low wouldn't have dreamt of - some of the rivers don't run the same direction any longer.<br />In this fine account of Albert Peter Low's travels in the northern boreal forest, Finkelstein and Stone use an unusual technique.  They retell Low's records of exploration, following with their attempts to trace the trail he left.  They have one great advantage.  Low thoroughly recorded and mapped what he saw and where he traversed.  The great disadvantage is that Low left virtually nothing of himself in the annals of Canadian explorers.  The chance of bringing A. P. Low &quot;to life&quot;, a major factor in any author's attempt to capture a subject, thus eludes these biographers. Yet, as you read this book, you'll see that you're not dealing with but &quot;half a man&quot;.<br />Canoe trips are part of the weave of Canadian history.  The voyageurs who brought furs from the upper Great Lakes are honoured by a bus line.  Their route, however, quickly became a commute - arduous and not without peril - but the unknown was dispensed with after a few trips.  A. P. Low's journeys were nearly all into territory unfamiliar to the &quot;white&quot; European-derived population of urban Canada.  He followed rivers on the Quebec-Labrador border, scouting for timber, minerals and potential agricultural sites.  He utilised whatever resources he encountered.  Aboriginal guides told him of their fur-trade and hunting routes.  Hudson Bay Company factories [trading posts] provided records.  Low, however, merely used these aids as pointers.  It was important to him to see for himself.  For Finkelstein and Stone, it was important to trace his paddling and his steps.  How they accomplished that makes for highly entertaining reading.<br />Although they had every modern convenience at their command, the authors found matching  Low's pace through the forests and along the rivers a distinct challenge.  Weather wasn't cooperative, although it seems little different than in Low's day.  Fires, a frequent occurrence in the spruce forests, sometimes left trees toppled across the trail.  That's assuming the portage was visible at all.  In a delightful aberration, they recount a live interview for a CBC programme using a cell 'phone.  Another device, a Global Positioning System unit, was occasionally dug from the pack, only to be apparently thwarted by heavy cloud!  Finkelstein develops what canoeists delicately refer to as &quot;diaper rash&quot;, and nauseates himself by adding the wrong &quot;creamer&quot; to his morning coffee.<br />There is another, more meaningful aspect of their journeys, however.  All those rushing streams, the wildlife depending on them and the Cree who have inhabited these lands for millennia, are under threat.  The Quebec government, declaring that the James Bay region must be &quot;conquered&quot; is diverting the rivers to feed the maws of hydro-electric generators.  Finkelstein is vividly aware of what the diversion of waters will mean as he travels the Rupert River with paddling partner Alain Filion.  There's more than backward-running streams, however.  He knows what impact the James Bay Project has had on the Cree peoples.  The building of houses and introduction of packaged food has significantly transformed their lifeways.  Finkelstein asks &quot;are the economic benefits worth the social turmoil&quot; and emerging health problems.

The opening chapter sets the tone by referring to the gospels as \\"theology as fictional narrative\\". Fiction, of course, is a departure from \\"journalism\\" or \\"history\\" as has been taught for almost two millennia. Designed as an introduction to the topic, \\"Gospel Fictions\\" isn't an academic study, although it's built from a solid text analysis and historical base. Hopefully, it's not a bad joke to refer to this book as \\"synoptic\\".<br /><br />Opening with a reminder that \\"divine origins and powers\\" for certain individuals were common myths in the Near East of two millennia ago, Helms notes that many of the gospel texts were based on widespread oral traditions. Incorporated into written accounts, sometimes bodily, legends were given greater substance by appearing in written form. Add some further authenticity by seeming to record actual dialogue, and a \\"gospel\\" is thus given an easy birth. While Helms offers the usual disclaimer that he intends no \\"quarrel with Christian faith\\", it's clear that by the time he's finished, divine \\"origins\\" or \\"inspiration\\" for these writings will have no basis.<br /><br />Helms asserts that understanding these books must begin with the order of the writings. Mark, not Matthew, should be the first in the stack. Both Matthew and Luke [and possibly John] directly derived their stories from his. Helms notes how many \\"standard phrases\\" in the Roman world were adopted into Gospel writings, later to be mistakenly viewed as from divine origins. Mark, Helms notes, \\"did not have to work in an intellectual or literary vacuum\\". Greek philosophy, Roman poetry, Jewish tales and, of course, legends from Egypt, Persia and Assyria all provided material for someone constructing a narrative.<br /><br />Instead of a strict stanza by stanza analysis of Mark and his followers, Helms uses a topical approach. After explaining \\"How to Begin a Gospel\\", he then analyses the Nativity Legends, the miracle fictions and the use of a heroic death and resurrection to enhance the protagonist. Mark, who left the \\"rising from the dead\\" issue hanging, is improved by his two followers who fleshed out the story with more detail - yet another two generations after the fact. It made thrilling reading, of course, when the final product was launched. One assumes that the original Markan text was discussed over dinners, debated in congregations and disputed by scholars. How many notes, commentaries and proposed changes were disposed of before \\"the bible\\" was put together two centuries later will likely remain unknown.<br /><br />One thing remains clear, the \\"gospels\\" can only be fictional accounts given the distance in time from the events. These fictions are clearly derived from many sources and skillfully assembled into readable narratives by their putative authors. Taught as dogma, the stories have had immense impact on Western society. Reading Helms may be a start in the process of dismantling the thrall our culture is held in by how these stories are imparted. Try him and see if you don't agree.

339790:US	50941451	R125MR8TQ0VE8G	0060655267	15902722	HarperCollins Study Bible: New Revised Standard Version (with the Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical Books)	Books	5	8	16	N	N	Such a long journey	There are inherent difficulties in reviewing a book such as this.  First, one must expect a clamour of resentment that any human can presume to \\"critique\\" a tome penned or inspired by divine mandate.  Superstition aside, there is the problem of which of the many versions of it.  By one count, there are two dozen \\"Authorised\\" [by whom remains a mystery] English language editions alone.  That number is further inflated by the \\"with Commentaries\\" appended to one or another of the versions.  Why, then, choose this particular edition?<br /><br />One reason is that this one has several advantages.  It was put together by a committee.  While that has \\"smeared\\" some of the terrible contradictions present in earlier editions, such as the once universal King James Version.  The Genesis story is therefore little more than a proclamation of everybody and everything coming into existence at once.  It would, of course, take far too much space to list the smoothings this committee has performed.  They have produced as readable a text as could be achieved, given the material.  This is the editor's declared intent, justifying his use of the New Standard Revised Edition [itself something of a paradox in terms] as the foundation for the commentary appended.<br /><br />They have also provided as much of the material as was available.  This means the addition of books left out of other anthologies due to doctrinal or theological disputes.  On the other hand, text that has \\"stood the test of time\\" has been \\"smoothed\\" in another way in order not to offend the sensibilities [and they are many and easily irritated] of the \\"gender feminists\\".  While that may enhance sales, it's questionable whether it's improved the narratives.  Since the collection merges two vast collections of material, it's clearly a book aimed at a Christian audience, if not a predominantly Protestant, one.<br /><br />The purpose of the book is informational.  This theme is introduced with a brief synopsis of the effort at textual analysis occurring mainly in the 19th Century.  The \\"Higher Criticism\\" evolved into deep investigations of the texts' origins, but also into the environments in which they were written.  The fruits of those efforts fills the bottom half of nearly every page of the anthology and doubles the usual number of pages.  Word origins in the books are explained, characters identified and events placed in historical context.  While this feature might impair the reader seeking \\"inspirational\\" insights from the text, to the critical reader, it is an excellent mechanism for setting the stories in context.  It is also helpful in assessing the literary styles and the logic applied by the various authors.  While the product is hefty, it is extremely useful.<br /><br />If study of the texts dominating the minds of millions is your interest, you would do well to start with this book.  Many of those millions will not relate to what this collection portrays, since it is either not in their language or alludes to events or peoples unknown in their society.  Even so, such a long journey as comprehending the roots of a superstition so widespread on the planet and pervasive in our culture must commence somewhere.  It may as well start here.

A people can adapt legends from outside, even a religion or two.  If these aren't expressed in terms common to the local populace, they're likely to be rejected.  If accepted, they may undergo some \\"loss in translation\\", and the culture adapts and expands its scope.  The diversity of human societies show how this process has progressed over the millennia.  Now, linguists estimate at least one human language disappears with every new moon.  Perhaps 6000 remain in common use in isolated enclaves.  Mark Abley flits over the globe to reveal some of the pockets of humanity where \\"minority\\" languages persist.  With deep feelings of respect for these languages and their associated cultures, he portrays their struggle for survival in the age of \\"globalisation\\".  People are being asked to trade off their culture and language for profit.<br /><br />Strung out from its African roots, humanity's spread over the planet has led to wide cultural and linguistic diversity.  Abley's opening chapter in a remote Australian community reflects both the diversity and longevity of the human diaspora.  Australia is home to the longest continuous cultural identity anywhere.  European invaders drove Aboriginal society into isolated pockets - such as the Mate Ke community perched on the Timor Sea.  There, the imposition of Roman Catholic missionaries and miners of any [or no] faith, have left only a tiny community of speakers of Murrin-Patha.<br /><br />The Mate-Ke  group becomes the model for much of the remainder of the book as Abley travels in various lands to observe the terminal state of many languages and cultures.  He was prompted in this by learning of Native Canadian elderly people struggling to impart their languages to children mentally chained to CBC television programming.  The book is not a continuously flowing narrative, but transports you from place to place, each with its resident language and society, in rather abrupt fashion.  That jumpy format should give the reader pause to consider what Abley is conveying.  It is the \\"isolated enclave\\" situation set in an incoming tidal flow of language and social change.  The inflowing language is too often English and the change is economic and industrial.  Even the last-ditch efforts to protect a language in Provencal France is contending against methods imposed by English-speaking nations - uniformity and conformity.  And the impact goes far beyond how one shops for groceries or orders up a beer.  The pattern is duplicated in the United States, India and Africa.<br /><br />This book makes an excellent companion to Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\".  Where Diamond focussed on the material imposition of European-based cultures on the remainder of the world, Abley shows how the invasion and occupation by these forces is demolishing the last vestiges of ancient cultures.  It's not a comforting picture.  Some resistance is emerging, sometimes in unexpected places.  The people of the Faeroes, that mystic group of islands somewhere north of London, are digging in to protect their ancient, if strangely mixed, language.  The isolated oceanic rock of bizarre felines, Isle of Man, is making efforts to keep its form of Gaelic something more than a tourist attraction.  And the Welsh are no longer apologising for maintaining a television channel in their native tongue.  Abley is a journalist, not a linguist, but his sense of feeling for threatened languages and their speakers would not likely be achieved by any ethnographer.  This book should be read by anyone wishing to understand the various facets the expansion of industrialised societies is having on people with no power to resist but that of the spoken word.

That's because Crowley is a demon.  \\"Cursing\\" under his breath doesn't offer a demon the emotional release the opposite expression would provide.  Crowley is one of The Two.  His opposite number, Azariphale, is an angel.  For six thousand years [Ussher missed the correct time of creation by fifteen minutes], they have wandered the planet awaiting the final encounter - Armageddon.  The arrival of the AntiChrist on Earth is what they've been preparing for.  Of course, it means both of them will thereby be laid off.  No more job.<br /><br />Pratchett and Gaiman's story of Christianity's two-millennia-long fulfillment episode is outstanding.  With their combined wit and inventiveness, \\"Good Omens\\" is at least a laugh per page.  A subset of humanity has blamed The Evil One for various wars, disasters and Labour governments.  Not so, according to Crowley, who should know.  Each time he thinks he's devised a truly fiendish torment to apply to humans, they've usually gotten in before him.  And exceeded his expectatations.  When it comes to vindictiveness, it seems nothing can outdo the human species.<br /><br />There's another side to humans, however.  It's sometimes discovered among children, who haven't learned the kinds of nastiness adults can develop.  Among the children of the remote British town of Tadfield is a four-member gang, the Them.  Three lads and a red-haired girl struggle to understand the adult world.  One of them, Adam, has a certain level of leadership.  He also has a dog - named \\"Dog\\".  A recent acquisition of Adam's, Dog has been developing a taste for rabbits, a novelty compared to his previous diet.<br /><br />Although the authors kindly provide a \\"Dramatis Personae\\" at the book's opening, listing various real and supernatural beings, one group enjoys a particular place in this book.  Witches have endured some interesting shifts in our history.  Where once they were dumped in the nearest scum-covered pond or fried upright bound to a post, now they have a new image.  Today it's health food, long beaded necklaces and ley lines.  Anathema Device, who may [or may not] be the descendent of Agnes Nutter, takes her role quite seriously.  After all, she has The Book.  The subtitle of \\"Good Omens\\" says it all [except you will relearn the  definition of \\"nice\\"].  Agnes foretold the future in astonishing detail and precision - a capacity surprising  Azariphale and occupying Anathema's time.<br /><br />Bringing all these disparate elements together seems an impossible task.  Especially since the logical conclusion would leave the book with a set of blank pages at the end.  Pratchett and Gaiman, who both have proved inventive in devising conclusions, don't fail you here.

Evolution's long, sometimes tortuous course, is necessarily spotted with species' demise and replacement.  In this book he is given the opportunity to cast his palaeontologist's eye into the future.  With many studies bemoaning the likelihood of the human species following the dodo and the dinosaur, Ward posits a diverging view.  In this charming, and stunningly illustrated study, he uses evidence from past extinctions to paint some scenarios for the future.<br /><br />Ward's career and credentials rule out this book being a light speculation with enticing graphics.  Those looking for a titillating or exotic glimpse into a possible future here will be disappointed.  Ward understands evolution and the morphology of living things.  Having studied the fossils with care, he knows what pointers suggest natural selection's likely course.  He also understands how environment affects how animals survive.  As a result, this \\"prediction\\" spends much more ink on past life and its losses than he does glimpsing into a vague future.  It also results in that glimpse having greater validity than some of the works speculating on forecasting life.<br /><br />Life, he reminds us, established body plans and habits within certain constraints.  Once four limbs became the norm, even extinctions didn't result in new experiments.  Large animals retained the basic plan.  So, therefore, will future life.  A pair of eyes, forward for predators and on the sides for prey species emerged continuously.  We can expect the same tomorrow.  Of far more importance, Ward feels, is whether the large fauna that preceded humanity will return.  Not a chance.  Small and medium-sized mammals will be the rule, although the likelihood of much larger rats and pigs, both exquisite scavengers, is likely.  There may be more avian species.  His speculation about flying toads might be the high point of the book.<br /><br />In what may be a surprise to many is Ward's dismissal that, although we have driven - and are driving - many species into extinction, it will be humans who persist for many more millenia.  And persist nearly unchanged.  The human body plan is well established and ensconced in every useable niche.  There is little selection pressure to change us.  The doom-sayers predicting the loss of habitat will elimate us along with those we've destroyed are thus refuted.  We are simply too adaptable to wither away unmourned.  One of our adaptations is the creation of \\"new\\" species through domestication.  Horses, cows, pigs and dogs have been bred by us to thrive in the environments we've created for them.  So long as we and they are mutually dependent, we will be able to continue with this altered food base.  Native species may disappear, but humans and pigs will march together into the \\"unknown country\\".<br /><br />Ward's text and Rockman's excellent graphic renditions make this book an eye-opening experience.  Neither are taking highly imaginative flights of fancy, but projecting the lessons of paleontology from the past to the future.  While it's easy to argue over many points Ward makes, his logic and science are irrefutable.  The book is worth your attention.

First, he didn't want objects sent into space to be retrieved.  They might bring back a species-specific microbe that could cut short his writing career.  Then he objected to tampering with fossil DNA for fear of T. Rex gobbling him down or an Apatosaurus trampling his flower beds.  The horrors of nanotechnology running amok and turning us all into grey goo was also presented.  The on-going theme has been science run amok - out of ignorance or for profit.  This time he's turned from science as bumbling into the unknown to science as special interest hostile to society.  In one of the poorest offerings in \\"science\\" fiction, Crichton envisions a well-financed band of \\"eco-terrorists\\" threatening his homeland.<br /><br />In this frothy tale, a millionaire has been duped by the \\"eco-terrorists\\" into funding their public awareness campaign.  A lawsuit on behalf of the Pacific island nation of Vanutu is a cover for more nefarious activities.  Weather incidents are to be enhanced to cause serious destruction and raise public concern.  Peter Evans, a young, handsome, randy lawyer, suffering a mild case of environmental conscience, is recruited by a \\"hidden\\" domestic counter-terrorist agency.  He's shipped around the planet like a wad of toxic waste to act as a lightning rod [literally!] against the \\"terrorist\\" scheme.  The eco-terrorist plot holds more water than exhibited in the narrative.  However, it's adventure and romance, so we mustn't take this lapse too seriously.<br /><br />The action is, to put it mildly, fast-paced.  The \\"terrorists\\" apparently have a tightly integrated world-wide network.  They're in the Antarctic, Arizona and across the Pacific.  Keeping up with such a scattered network is difficult for the reader.  How the anti-hero Kenner achieves it eludes us.  Except he has Sanjong - equally competent with laptop or rifle.  Sanjong always seems to know what's going on.  He has about a dozen lines to impart his talents.  Even so, they convey more than Crichton manages in this entire book.  Instead of character or plot building, Crichton uses his characters to fabricate a dialog about what's wrong with environmental science.  The exchanges are simplistic, override whatever worth the story might have and are demonstrably misleading.  His use of Lomberg as a source should be a signal flare to all.  Crichton's disclaimers about \\"this is only fiction\\" at front and back of the book don't ring true.  His statement \\"the footnotes are real\\" is specious.  I'd be pleased to offer any number of corrections to many of them.<br /><br />When this book is converted to film, the producers could save a great deal of money using Barbie [TM] or Ken [TM] dolls instead of people.  Such figures would better represent the characters Crichton has portrayed.  Evans' opening dedication to the issue of climate change is shallow, but his rapid conversion to Kenner's proselytizing against it is worse.  He might have done what Crichton claims to do - find \\"real quotes\\".  He makes no effort.  The women who arrive and depart in this woeful endeavour are uniformly beautiful, arrogant and extremely talented in their chosen roles - except the only passion they manifest is negative.  The attempt to merge scientist with federal agent in the person of Kenner is simply ridiculous.  Scientists air their objections in papers and conferences, not with a rifle.<br /><br />This book comes dangerously close to being simply fraudulent.  It's such an obvious polemic against erosion of \\"the American lifestyle\\" that it's difficult to see how the publisher could find a category for it.  A pitiful effort on many counts and one to be avoided.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]en so, they convey more than Crichton manages in this entire book.

The \\"frontier legend\\" of endless land and resources, adminstratively concluded over a century ago, is socially and economically moribund.  As Americans expand into former farm and pasteur lands to establish autonomous \\"burbclaves\\" [thank you, Neal Stephenson!], Europe is becoming increasingly integrated.  While still fitful and incomplete, the term \\"European Union\\" is advancing beyond being merely a political structure.  It is becoming a continental identity well on the way to becoming the \\"European Dream\\".  Although still nascent, the idea is sinking ever deeper roots into the European psyche.  In this excellent study of two cultural structures, Rifkin offers lessons to America and to the world.<br /><br />Organised in three themes, Rifkin's book notes first that a new age is dawning.  The tenor of that age is symbolised by Europe's shedding of old disputes and animosities.  Although Rifkin avoids judging the impact of European imperialism over the centuries, he recognises that Europe's aid to developing countries far outstrips that of the United States.  Whether that makes up for past intrusions remains to be seen, but the effort is under way and having a positive impact.  His second section is an examination of the process of Europe's cultural and economic evolution from scattered communities to the rise of the nation-state.  Religion's impact is described, particularly from the religions which fled to North America to provide a new political entity.  One, Puritanism, developed essentially in isolation.  In conclusion, he claims for Europe the role of a \\"new land of opportunity\\".  The opportunity is a new economic drive, giving the EU nations a trade surplus, which stands in stark contrast to America's deficit.  Beyond economics is the wider cultural view in Europe contrasted with the US.  This \\"soft power\\" approach is gaining adherents in many world regions, offering a model for other areas to emulate.  The EU flag of but two colours, gold stars on a blue field, represents new ways of thinking and doing that are worth emulating.<br /><br />Rifkin is clear that Europe and America have different \\"psyches\\", their shared historical roots notwithstanding.  More than simply blurring national boundaries and supporting a common currency, the respective approaches to life are growing ever more disparate.  He compares economic endeavour, lifestyle approaches and socio-political aspirations.  There are drastic differences, he argues in such things as rate of growth, leisure and productive time and the number of people in prisons.  In short, \\"America is worth dying for but Europe is worth living for\\".  Such expressions are signs of how variously Europeans and Americans view themselves.  And these indications will have serious impact on future developments in both regions and beyond.  The European approach to freedom and security, which is communal rather than individual, has already led to other nations seeking closer ties with Europe.  They are knocking on its door seeking admission.  This situation stands in stark contrast to America's method of exporting these ideological commodities by intrusion.<br /><br />Rifkin is the first to acknowledge the European Dream is in anything more than an emergent condition.  He recognises the issue of cheap immigrant labour has generated stresses, both social and economic.  \\"Security\\" can only be maintained with an effective response force, something which is already in process.  Bosnia was a disaster, not to be repeated.  Rifkin argues that it was a lesson learned.  Each step, even if halting, Rifkin feels to be in a forward direction.  Europe, he argues, isn't striving to be a superpower, just a workable and effective one.  If its dream continues to built along the forms laid down over the past generation, it is likely to be fulfilled.  Read this book to find out how and why.

Le Carre begins his examination of the modern form of imperialism with the murder of the wife of Woodward's colleague, Justin Quayle.  Woodward has reason to know Tessa's murder may not be a random killing.  His definition of ethics places him among those once called \\"the Silent Majority\\".  A civil servant on the rise, he reflects how ethical values have been eroded by surging \\"globalization\\".  The erosion results from a rising tide of a new imperialism - the multi-national corporation.  There are billions of dollars to be made in developing new drugs and ethics aren't profitable.  When government policy furthers the process, people like Woodward are there to help it along.  How Le Carre's people deal with  ethics is the central focus of this book.<br /><br />The George Smiley trilogy gave us a lexicon of \\"spy industry\\" jargon.

It's a term that is likely to be with us for some time.  In the way that his spy novels kept us focused on the Soviets as cruel foes, the pharmas are depicted as influential, determined powers existing  nearly uncontrolled.  Unlike the image carried by the Soviet antagonists, the pharmas' image is ameliorated by the demand for their products.  Everyone wants what they can provide.  What cost are we prepared to pay in their bringing it to us?  Le Carre bluntly confronts us with that question.  Le Carre shows vividly how the response is clearly individual.  No agency will front for us in dealing with the pharmas.<br /><br />A departure from his spy novels, this book is hard to categorize.  That's good, since it shows Le Carre has breadth and remains capable of surprise.  He's on a campaign here, and wants us to join it.  He shows the venality of government agencies under thrall to outside forces and depicts the people representing those elements with skill.  Woodward is particularly well portrayed, as is Curtiss, the pharma baron.  Justin Quayle is more difficult to diagnose.  For a Foreign Office functionary, his ability to \\"go to earth\\" seems rather elevated, but Le Carre needs this to give us all the information we require.  Only Le Carre could give a persona to someone dead, displaying it without providing a living voice at any point.  Tessa speaks through Justin Quayle's memories and interpretation of events.  It seems clear that the characters take a back seat to the message of the book.<br /><br />Justification for the conclusion of this tale seems lacking.  It's almost as if Le Carre had tired of writing and had to contrive an ending, no matter how illogical.  There's no motivation given for the pilgrimage, especially with prior events related in the story.  The scene is very nearly a reprise of Leamas at the Berlin Wall in Spy Who Came In From The Cold.  There is the same sense of philosophical failure and bleak future.  Clearly, this book will not launch a trilogy in the vein of Smiley's quest.  Which is sad, since globalization is a force sweeping the world in ways that would have made Lenin cry out with envy.  Le Carre shows how the morality of communism and corporatism stand at par, toppling governments, repressing dissent and manipulating lives.  Once again, Le Carre has exposed a world hidden from most of us.  He's exposed it with his usual skill at language and characterization.  It's a book to be ignored at your peril.

Pratchett's subtle dismantling of treasured beliefs is nowhere better displayed than in this trilogy.  Relating three epic journeys, he follows a small group of small people emigrating from their ancestral home in the country.  The chips aren't down, but there aren't enough in the truck stop's trash bin.  And there aren't any more rats.  These little people, the nomes, must find a new home.  Snatching a ride on a lorry, they find one.  It's a department Store, Arnold Bros, [est 1905], inhabited by thousands more nomes.  Divided into family clans, the nomes of The Store believe it to be the entire universe.  Masklin and his little group, therefore, cannot exist!  They're from Outside - beyond the universe.<br /><br />Their universe, however, is threatened by something worse than \\"Fire Sale\\" or \\"Final Clearance\\".  There's a demolition order issued and \\"Everything Must Go!\\"  For real.  Masklin, who led his little tribe in from Outside, must now lead them and thousands of others back there.  The escape from The Store - the abandonment of a known universe - is traumatic.  It's also a side-splitter.  Just how do 10 cm \\"people\\" arrange to drive their own lorry?  \\"Let's have a bit of fast, down there!\\" doesn't start to convey Pratchett's descriptive powers.  Nor the clashes of personalities involved in steering, signalling and achieving \\"Lots and lots of stop!\\"  The stopping results in the nome community taking up residence in a rural quarry.<br /><br />The exodus of the nomes from the universe of The Store to a promised land Outside generates a whole range of new problems.  Not the least of which is the knowledge that this isn't the end of the journey.  Masklin possesses a small \\"black box\\" which imparts arcane information about what this \\"Moses\\" of nomes must do to return his people to their real home.  It's going to take more than nicking a store lorry.  They must travel further - to a place called \\"Florida\\" - then into Outer Space.  It will require planning, daring and ingenuity, but one nome is up to the task.  Masklin's sense of purpose would shame a missionary.  Yet, even in the face of incredible dangers and novelty, some nomes have to be restrained in their eagerness to explore new universes.  Others, of course, hang back in the security of what's known - even when that foundation changes.<br /><br />Throughout these stories, the implications of scale are paramount.  How readily would you perceive 10 cm high \\"people\\" scurrying about beneath your feet?  If you were that tall, how would you perceive the universe?  Gurder, the young Abbott, manages to come to grips with the existence of Outside the Store.  But leaving it doesn't mean abandoning Arnold Bros [est. 1905].  He insists that Arnold Bros [est. 1905] is present everywhere, and all the time.  With each new reality, Gurder is able to adjust his frame of reference.  Sound familiar?  At the other end of the scale, Pratchett introduces us to the Amazonian Tree Frog.  These tiny creatures inhabit the flowers of the \\"bromeliads\\" - plants living in trees instead of the ground.  Their universe is one blossom - until one peers over the edge.<br /><br />Take up this trilogy and peer over the edge.

If any mind of the 20th Century might be said to equal Darwin's it would be that of Edward Osborne Wilson.  An entomologist, it was Wilson who demonstrated the implications of insect societies for human cultures.  His ideas were first promulgated in his 1975 book \\"Sociobiology\\" and bore full fruit with \\"Consilience\\" in 1998.  In \\"Consilience\\", Wilson proposed that, as humans were as much a part of Nature as any other creature, our behaviour traits, including the arts and literature, should be viewed in the light of evolution.  Wilson demonstrated how the human spirit would be expanded, not diminished, by such a framework.  The research ensuing since \\"Sociobiology\\" has affirmed Wilson's insight.  How would such scenario apply to literature?<br /><br />Joseph Carroll, a literary critic, incorporates Wilson's insights throughout this collection.  Carroll argues that our outlook on the world would be expanded, not confined, by consciously applying Darwin's principles to our literature.  Many authors, he notes, have done this through an intuitive sense.  Jane Austen, hardly a Darwinian, still presented her characters fully integrated within their natural environment.  Austen distinguished between which environments suited a character and which left the individual feeling displaced.  For Carroll, this is an encouraging sign.  Observant and astute writers can apply what he calls the \\"Darwinian paradigm\\", imparting a more natural and plausible foundation to fiction.  He wants new writers to understand how to employ those principles from the outset.  In this, Carroll is following where Wilson is pointing.  The result, Carroll feels, will be an improved basis for literature's production and analysis.<br /><br />Narrative itself, not only common to the human condition, but apparently necessary to it, reflects our ancestral past.  As Wilson pointed out, human beings are a social, not a solitary,  animal.  Carroll's thesis furthers this idea by noting that narrative accounts are a means of identification within a community.  Depicted human interactions must reflect that situation and be based on firm knowledge of Darwinian principles, not on assumptions nor sketchy awareness.  He criticises authors who pay lip service to the \\"Darwinian paradigm\\" without truly understanding its tenets.<br /><br />Carroll's thesis is based on what is known as \\"the Adapted Mind\\".  Our mental states, whether in writing or reading, are derived from the long evolutionary path we've traversed.  We aren't separated or \\"elevated\\" from it.  Much of his attention is given to revealing the false notion of \\"poststructuralism\\" - that there are no \\"truths\\" [whether absolute or relative] and that authors have no intent in their writings, simply expression formed by local \\"culture\\".  Darwin's idea, for example, could only have occured in Victorian Britain.  Obviously, in such a framework, evolutionary roots have no role in composition, reading or criticism.  It seems trite when Carroll writes \\"the subject matter of literature is human experience\\", but he feels we need to be reminded of that truth.  Writing, he contends, must reflect that truism more forcefully than is often the case.  Steps have already been taken, he notes.  Such works as \\"Biopoetics\\" and \\"Homo Aestheticus\\" are indicators of a more realistic approach in fiction.<br /><br />Carroll's three part collection - a view of the \\"literary landscape\\", theory and practical criticism, and assessments of Darwian biographers and critics, is a splendid example of how consilience works.  He is opening a new frontier of both writing and reading, and is optimistic for its success.  He stresses that a merger of the humanities and sciences, is not only desireable, but necessary.  A better knowledge of ourselves must involve a better knowledge of our world.  That can only be beneficial to all humanity and its habitat, using literatureas a means.

Years of working at intelligence and writing of the spy's world, you'd think he'd earned a rest.  But the lessons of the Cold War, ignored by the West's leaders today, fuel his creativity.  So, in his seventh decade, his ascerbic pen [keyboard?] continues chronicling political fallacies.  In a style harsher than most of his previous books, Le Carre confronts today's world even more forcefully than in the past.  His command of language remains unmatched, but subtlety has been tempered with a new assertiveness.<br /><br />In creating a new character, Le Carre depicts a long span of time in this book.  Ted Mundy's early years as a student radical in Berlin establish the foundation for this story.  There, Mundy encounters Sasha, who becomes friend and mentor.  Mundy, not a revolutionary, has a vague notion of wanting a better world.  Lacking Sasha's dedication, and being shipped back to Britain, Mundy's life becomes the image of a man shambling along a country lane.  No purpose, no successes - the images of his childhood in Pakistan with a drunken officer father and Muslim Ayah [nanny] impinge on his consciousness.  As do the tales Col. Mundy told of Ted's almost divine mother.  In his wanderings, Ted's links with Sasha are lost.  He's an absent friend.<br /><br />After many frustrating years, some in America, Mundy returns to Britain.  His wanderings and introspections have led him to create a series of \\"selfs\\" - Mundy One, Two and so on.  A new one is created when he's recruited to become an agent.  The \\"cultural\\" maven is an old ploy for snooping or running agents.  Mundy seems to have a magic touch, not least because his primary contact is Sasha.  Sasha, disillusioned with the absolutisms and hypocrisies of the communist regimes, is a double agent in his own right.  Between the two, links are forged to give Mundy the highest accolades from his British masters.  The collapse of the Soviet Union reduces much of Mundy's focus - he's already passed through a marriage and fatherhood.<br /><br />Adding to his confusion is another appearance of Sasha, who had vanished with The Wall.  Sasha  has a project.  A big project - one that will remake the world.  The American invasion of Iraq has unbalanced Mundy and Sasha's proposal tips him further.  What role could a tired, middle-aged former radical have in relation to the crusade of the Coalition of the Willing?  Le Carre speaks through his characters to condemn the sham of a professed expansion of liberty hiding a new colonialism.  He uses Mundy to act as a foil to hypocritical Anglo-American adventures.  Mundy knows both worlds, and some beyond.  He should be a valiant campaigner with Sasha as his partner and mentor.  Can he meet and overcome this new challenge?<br /><br />Le Carre's mastery of portrayal of the spy's persona has lost nothing with the passage of years.  Ted Mundy is an entirely new character.  He's not the dotty old uncle of George Smiley, nor the rambunctious adventurer of \\"Honourable Schoolboy\\".  Mundy could be a neighbour, even a cousin or close friend.  His stresses are internal, but not entirely closed off.  Hiding your life's work in mundane employment is a soul-breaking role, and Le Carre has depicted it masterfully.  A book to be enjoyed in reprise, even if the ultimate outcome remains in the hands of the Coalition of the Willing.

He acknowledges the impact Darwin has had on our view of life.  And the supernatural.  Many of Darwin's successors declared natural selection signalled the end of theism.  That terminal judgment will be addressed in this book, but he warns that theology must still \\"come to grips\\" with the \\"opulence of evolution\\".  From this opening he seeks to create a new theology.  In order to launch this enterprise, Haught must sweep away some obstructions.  Among these obstacles is the wave of \\"intelligent design\\" [which is neither] - Michael Behe's excuse for failing to understand how natural selecton works.  Haught dismisses Behe with ease, claiming the idea \\"ignores novelty\\".  So far, so good.<br /><br />Haught then mounts his pulpit to steal a book title as a means of launching an assault on Darwin's most penetrating students, Daniel C. Dennett and Richard Dawkins.  \\"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\\" [1995] is what this book is about.  Haught flaunts the term often.  Each time, he tries to discount it, sniping at Dennett for being \\"prolific\\" and his presentation as done \\"in laborious detail\\".  The detail appears to have been too much for Haught, since he seems to have missed many of the more obvious points.  Dawkins, a much more outspoken non-theist than Dennett, if that's possible, gives Haught the vapours.  Dawkins' \\"selfish gene\\", a frequent target of theists, here undergoes the usual vilification.  It's \\"materialist\\" and \\"mechanistic\\".  When you're building a case for the supernatural, such ideas are anathema.  Perhaps even worse for Haught than the \\"Three-D\\" figures is that of Edward O. Wilson.  At least Dennett and Dawkins aren't lapsed Christians, but Wilson shed his Baptist upbringing when he discovered gods and life aren't related.  What greater betrayal could a theologian encounter?<br /><br />While Haught is disparaging the non-theists, he steps back a bit.  He wants to show he's a reasonable man.  We're all good fellas, here.  He demonstrates his knowledge [such as it is] of Darwin's Dangerous Idea, but he wants to add a new element.  A deity.  Somewhere in the process some god has to be involved, he says.  Well, his god at any rate.  That step back puts him on a slippery slope.  As Haught builds his thesis, you observe him sliding down the ramp.  The ramp is labelled \\"sophistry\\" and Haught has a supreme talent for it.  He wants to create a \\"theology of evolution\\" - perhaps one of the more bizarre concepts of modern times.  Haught takes us through \\"laborious detail\\" in explaining how many philosophers and theologians have struggled to merge Darwin and a deity.  All have failed and Haught is no exception.<br /><br />Haught's sophistry utilises a range of voices.  He even snares Taoism for a prop.  He finally selects two buttresses - Jesuit Teilhard de Chardin and philosopher Hans Jonas.  De Chardin's struggle to reconcile natural selection with metaphysics has been refuted too many times to recount here.  Jonas may be new to some of Haught's readers, but Haught attempts to introduce him.  A follower of Alfred North Whitehead, Jonas was also influenced by Jewish Kabbalistic thought.  He contends the deity [please note \\"the\\"] made the universe with the \\"promise\\" of life - and, one presumes, at some point would produce an intellect to observe it.  Jonas pushes this deity about as far from human ken as can be achieved and still have any meaning.  As a stretch of conceivability and expression of unreality, there are few peers.  What purpose such a deity could have remaining escapes understanding - and reason.  It turns out this is the whole point - at some future time one of natural selection's products, humanity, will reach an \\"Omega Point\\" to encounter this deity.  To what end isn't explained.<br /><br />Books such as Haught's are attempts to reconcile the irrational with the real.  Limited, as he is, by his Roman Catholic Christianity, he starts with a flimsy a priori stance.  He then tries to shore it up with a confusion of quotations synopsised ideas.  As we wade through his quote snippets, we learn that an event never historically justified, a crucifixion, provides one gleam of illumination for his thesis.  A dim light to steer by.

369041:US	50941451	R2ZZ1A5W9I93RF	0060655186	602904794	Who Wrote the New Testament?: The Making of the Christian Myth	Books	5	158	189	N	N	Fabulous fables and garbled Gospels	Since the Higher Criticism efforts in the late 19th Century, biblical researchers have probed deeply into the origins of Scriptural texts.  Contributions from archaeology and other disciplines have added new information on the times and places dealt with in biblical texts.  Burton Mack, in a sweeping study of the foundations of the Christian myth, offers an in-depth analysis of the progress of the movement.  He also broadens the scope of view by placing its growth in a wider social context.  Not a \\"serious\\" academic tome, Mack has produced a study for a wide readership.  He gives us a better understanding of the roots and development of the book considered so fundamental in many people's lives.  With astute insights presented in lively style, he has offered much for reflection.<br /><br />Wisely side-stepping the historical validity of Jesus, Mack follows the foundation and likely development of the way one man's teachings became a global movement.  Whether Jesus actually lived is insignificant beside how stories of his life and ideas were promulgated.  Mack carefully depicts the socio-political scenario in which the Jesus story took root.  Palestine's population had undergone severe disruptions in recent times.  At the time of Jesus, the Jews, either exiled or conquered, had suffered various dislocations, although the worst was yet to come.  During the period under Alexander's domination, many Greek ideas permeated Palestine, including various scholastic practices.  These, Mack points out, would have strong impact on how the Jesus story was developed and spread.  It also increased the toil of scholars struggling to understand who wrote what and when they did it.  Students often composed essays in the name of some emminant scholar as a means of demonstrating their comprehension of the material.<br /><br />From an analysis of text styles, Mack derives the existence of a series of \\"Jesus movements\\", several being located in northern Palestine.  These \\"Q\\" documents are teachings attributed to Jesus, with no biographical description.  They could be the ideas of one or more thinkers of the time and locality, but are generally accepted as being from one teacher.  The \\"Q\\" texts were incorporated into the Mark account, then embellished - the earliest of the Christian \\"Gospels\\".  Mack notes that unlike the \\"Q\\" writings which were closer in time to any actual events, the later \\"Gospel\\" authors implied they were witnesses to them.  This, of course, along with the many \\"miracles\\" related by these writers, was pure fiction, as Mack stresses.<br /><br />The progressive writings making up the \\"Gospels\\" transformed the \\"Jesus movements\\" into the \\"Christ cults\\".  Instead of merely an inspired teacher, Jesus now becomes a divine being.  The level of divinity - \\"from\\" the deity, \\"of\\" the deity, or actually the deity was different according to the author[s] location and proclivities.  This disparity is the foundation for the multitude of \\"heresies\\" arising in later centuries.  The various \\"Christ cults\\" were adapted to suit the locality Christians inhabited.  In seeking converts, a different approach might be used for Jews than for gentiles, Romans than for Greeks.  Making Christianity attractive to its foundations, the Jewish epic, was a particularly daunting task.  Calling a man who had no discernible record of godly manifestations a \\"messiah\\" outraged Jews. Another tack had to be found.  The scheme adopted was the projection of Jesus as the reason for creation.  These strategies relied on different writings for authority.  Mack traces the changes in outlook with patient skill - it's an immense task.  Writers, teachers, historians and philosophers are thoroughly intermixed in creating and modifying the \\"Holy Book\\".  Unravelling is a challenge to the finest intellect.<br /><br />The admixture of so many contributions of such varying basis demanded unravelling.  It is unlikely there would be a \\"bible\\" or even such singular Christianity as there is without the accident of Constantine.  His \\"conversion\\", incomplete as it was, came with his elevation to Emperor.  That immense power led him to quell the continuing internecine dissent among his Christian population by having one scholar, Eusebius, collect and merge the existent writings into one volume.  The result was the bible available today.  With the stamp of Imperial approval, Mack notes, Christianity was free to follow where Rome led.<br /><br />One place it led to, of course, is Mack's North American audience.  In his conclusion, he urges all who revere this book to look at it realistically.  He is scathing in his description of those who \\"turn the crank 'round and 'round\\" to justify actions or policies with citations from the book.  This \\"quoting scripture\\" for selfish purposes has a special role in America, he notes.  Using Christian mythology to justify actions in a multicultural world is fallacious and dangerous, he feels [the irony of recent events fulfilling this stance is staggering].  This book is a true resource and will stimulate further research and discussion for years.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]ntine.

Scrabbling over cliffs and following the slashes in the land made for canals and railroads, people were discovering fossils.  The transformed bones and shells of ancient creatures weren't new.  They had been used as medicine and charms to ward off \\"evil spirits\\" for centuries.  The new finds, however, were more perplexing.  Large teeth and massive bones suggested that creatures of unimaginable scale had once inhabited the Earth.  In Britain, two new sciences emerged around the novel discoveries - geology and paleontology.  Cadbury traces these developments with an enthusiastic account of the people drawn to the new sciences.<br /><br />After a diversion describing Mary Anning, a young villager who found fossils on coastal cliffs, Cadbury traces the thinking on what fossils implied.  Biblical creation had already been challenged on many fronts, particularly among French scientists.  The British finds launched a major challenge to standard views of Earth's history.  Gideon Mantell, interested in the fossil ammonites at a young age, went on to carve a major life as a geologist.  In early 19th Century Britain, paleontology had yet to break off from geology, although fossils were the key to relative placement in time.  Cadbury describes how Mantell's love for fossils was given an unexpected boost by his \\"day job\\" as a doctor.  Medicine laid a groundwork in anatomy which would prove beneficial in later years.<br /><br />Mantell, through incredible adversity, persisted in amassing large fossil collections.  Not only were the collections massive numerically, but some of the bones retrieved implied tremendous creatures.  Cadbury does a fine job of explaining the impact these discoveries had on educated Britain.  Christian theology remained the foundation for learning, and the fossils clearly challenged church dogma.  British Christianity responded with the \\"Bridgewater Treatises\\" - an attempt to mortise Nature into theology.  Darwin's insight was decades away, and Cadbury explains how this venture was but one of the various notions preceding natural selection.  The \\"fossil\\" debates took place mostly in the academic arena.  The growing scientific societies skirted the issue of divinity, but it was clear data was challenging dogma.<br /><br />As Mantell's efforts continued, new figures emerged to investigate the puzzling artefacts.  Among the students of ancient life, Richard Owen emerged as the champion of analysis.  Owen, a domineering figure in Cadbury's account, rose rapidly in importance.  He had no qualms about demolishing another's propositions, nor, indeed, their career.  His stature in British scientific circles precluded effective challenges and Mantell became one of his chief victims.

Highly detailed, the cartographer declared in his notes that he had drawn on many sources, some quite ancient, to produce the chart.  The cartographer was a Turkish Admiral and the chart became known as the Piri Reis Map.  Among its mysteries, it depicted a detailed shoreline of Antarctica.<br /><br />The Piri Reis Map becomes a key element in Deborah Jackson's adventurous tale of scientists confronting bizarre mysteries in harsh conditions.  Erica Daniels is a mountain climber.  She's a vulcanologist and the mountains she climbs are capable of ejecting her from their slopes - along with tons of rock, ash and lava.  Erica has had more than mountains to conquer.  The machinations of ambitious men have been as severe a hazard as any pyroclastic flow.  In university, her career well planned and ready to be undertaken, her lover decamps with her thesis to initiate his own success.<br /><br />As a result, David Marsh becomes a noted geologist.  He's crafty and ambitious, rising to be chosen to investigate craters on the moon for water and minerals.  Chance observations of our neighbour in space have indicated the possibility that Luna may not be as dead as is thought.  If the moon has geological activity, it will have serious implications for any colony.  NASA has already taken the first step with a HAB base constructed only nine years from now.  In Jackson's story, the year 2015 will be portentious.  Relations with China will have improved to the point where an astronaut from there will be joining Marsh on his expedition.  There are interesting lunar features to explore and Marsh is the best researcher available.  Or is he?<br /><br />Although Daniels and Marsh carry abrasive memories of their past relationship, Jackson's story keeps them interacting at several levels.  Erica has been called away from an Alaskan climb that threatened to extinguish her abilities - along with herself - to journey to the other Pole.  From a \\"hotspot\\" atop an Alaskan mountain, she's been asked to cross the globe to Antarctica.  Another \\"hotspot\\" - one that shouldn't exist - has been reported on the southernmost continent.  Worse, it seems to have been gobbling up people.  On her way, Erica encounters archaeologist Allan Rocheford.  Inexplicably, this desert digger is also interested in the Antarctic hotspot.  He has an idea of why it's there and what it implies.  He's found something in a dig in Egypt that relates to the evidence given by the Piri Reis map - Antarctica hasn't always enjoyed the conditions there now.  Is the \\"hotspot\\" under the ice an alien artefact?  Or something even more profound?<br /><br />Marsh arrives on the moon and begins exploring one of the mysterious \\"rilles\\" - deep ravines that stretch over the moonscape.  He encounters wholly unexpected conditions.  \\"Lava tubes\\" are a phenomenon of some Earth volcanoes.  They are the result of quick surface cooling of molten magma leaving the interior still fluid and flowing.  The result is a long cylinder of stone, easily adaptable to conversion into a habitat.  On the moon the much-reduced force of gravity could leave such structures much larger than found here.  What might such a stone configuration contain?  With his Russian companion, Vochenkov, Marsh seeks understanding of this most bizarre of lunar secrets.  Is the moon still an active world?  What will that mean for the extension of the habitat?  Marsh's explorations indicate he needs more expertise to resolve the riddles.  Who better to supply that extra knowledge than Erica Daniels?  The link between the mysterious structures on the moon and the enigma under Antarctic ice reveals the deepest mystery of all.<br /><br />Jackson's book is a good reason why speculative fiction should shed its stigma of \\"fantasy based on research\\".  Set in the immediate future, and based on a wealth of research, there is little here that couldn't be achieved in this story.  Nor are the speculations wholly invalid.  The Piri Reis Map was assessed by cartographers who deemed most of its displayed landforms as conforming to modern configurations.  Jackson builds her story with care, staffing it with people we might encounter in any academic or government research facility.  There are petty jealousies, intense emotion both attractive and repellent.  The scientist's dedication to revealing the underlying elements of what appears to be fantastic is admirably displayed.  Erica Daniels may appear a bit explosive, but what other characteristics is one to expect from a vulcanologist?  David Marsh plunders a thesis, but competition among scientists has bred unsavoury conduct before.  In short, this is an adventuresome tale in a realistic setting.  It's something to take up when you seek excitement.  You won't be disappointed. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]r are the speculations wholly invalid.

375745:US	50941451	R2HA2OG66VQY4N	081353433X	960399790	Why Intelligent Design Fails: A Scientific Critique of the New Creationism	Books	5	120	157	N	N	"Has the jury reached a verdict?"	Indeed it has.  The verdict is \\"Guilty!\\"  The notion of Intelligent Design, which has been deemed neither \\"intelligent\\" nor a \\"design\\",  has proven another flawed attempt to dispose of evolution by natural selection.  In this essay collection, a jury of \\"twelve good men\\" [why are there no women authors here?], analyse the ideas of the major spokesmen [again!] of the ID movement.  The writings of William Dembski, Michael Behe and others are closely scrutinised in terms of logic and science - and are found severely wanting.  Christian \\"creationism\\" [for ID is merely \\"creationism under a new cognomen] wears many faces.  The editors of this collection accept that the \\"new wave\\" of creationism has cast off \\"biblical literalism\\", to grant ID the rank of a \\"philosophy\\".  It is the question of ID's self-proclaimed \\"scientific base\\" the essays examine closely.<br /><br />This is hardly a new exercise.  Many authors have addressed the validity of ID, but the precision and expertise brought to bear by this group makes this collection unique.  The various essayists dispassionately examine the ID contentions.  Wisely avoiding the politics and polemics of the ID movement, the authors each consider elements on their merits.  ID is considered here in its \\"scientific\\" and mathematical claims alone.  Can \\"scientific creationism\\", an alias accepted by many ID adherents, be a valid approach to biology?<br /><br />The editors note that after fitful beginnings, ID surged to public awareness with Michael Behe's 1996 book.  Behe, who is a master at self-touting, claims his ideas should be \\"ranked as one of the greatest achievements in the history of science\\".  However, the invitation to Stockholm has been noticeably missing.  Behe's contentions have been refuted so many times by so many people, it seems redundant to review them here.  His argument that certain features of life, flagellum, \\"the\\" eye and other mechanisms are \\"irreducibly complex\\" - take away one [of three!] part and the system fails.  His unfortunate use of the mousetrap as a metaphor has resulted in some hilarious countering designs, the best of which remains Michael Ruse's single bent wire version.  Far more significant, is Behe's expressed ignorance of evolutionary processes.  As Matt Young and David Ussery point out in their respective essays, not only is the metaphor fallacious, Behe's use of the flagellum is a faulted example.  Many of the components of the flagellum exist in certain microorganisms, busily doing other jobs.  Behe simply overlooked what else the parts of his mousetrap might be good for.  Ian Musgrave's account of the evolution of the bacterial flagellum is one of the more notable essays here.<br /><br />Following Behe, the jury ponders the works of William Dembski.  Dembski is the acknowledged \\"philosopher\\" of the ID movement.  He's welcome to the title.  Dembski's convoluted notions about the cosmos and life use arcane mathematical structures to \\"prove\\" \\"chance\\" cannot have generated either the universe nor life.  Several essayists in \\"Why Intelligent Design Fails  examine his contentions carefully.  Dembski has argued for, but never presented evidence supporting, a \\"design inference\\".  Taner Edis, Mark Perakh and Gary Hurd's essays address this and other pronouncements of Dembski's in detail.  In brief, all of this \\"philosopher's\\" theses fail tests of logic and show no scientific foundation.<br /><br />The nature of the subjects investigated in this collection and the scientific tests the authors apply, make this book a less than rapid read.  The various authors must present the ID theses as best they can.  Many of those notions beggar clear presentation since most are contrived and often self-contradictory within themselves.  Even the later writings of ID proponents which might incorporate corrections have failed to explain or correct false ideas.  As the concluding essay notes, all the ID writings are based on a dogma, to which information is attached.  Sincethis is the reverse of normal scientific procedure, analysis is impaired.  Yet, this jury has carefully considered the evidence.  Their judgment is valid - ID is not science.

380357:US	50941451	R3QTEQARWJ6AHE	1400062195	973983026	Free World: America, Europe, and the Surprising Future of the West	Books	5	8	14	N	N	The two faces of 9/11	With years of European and American journalism as a foundation, Garton Ash seeks a means of preventing skirmishes from turning into clashes.  The interests of Europe and America are the same, he contends.  The primary one is \\"freedom\\".  Where freedom can be enjoyed by a populace, other benefits assuredly follow.  With freedom, however, comes responsibility.  Part of that responsibility is the recognition that the remainder of the world does not enjoy those freedoms.  To bring that Free World about, there must be compromises.  In recognising where compromises must be made, policy makers must confront world realities, not simply follow entrenched dogmas.  In this compelling study, he brings great insight into analysing the issues our societies face and offers provocative solutions for them.<br /><br />Garton Ash uses something as simple as how Europeans and Americans write dates.  The infamous \\"9/11\\" [September 11] in the United States is a glorious \\"9/11\\" [09 November] in Europe.  These are the pivotal dates in viewing the true onset of the 21st Century.  For the United States, it is the collapse of the World Trade Centre under the hijackers' assault.  For Europeans, the collapse of the Berlin Wall signalled the end of a divided continent.  For the United States, \\"9/11\\" has divided a nation by an administration bent on revenge.  In Europe \\"9/11\\" is an opportunity to consolidate and dispose of old rivalries.  In making this comparison, however, the author is quick to point out that none of these images are as simple as they appear.  Europe has a long way to go to shed local interests and jealousies.  The United States is a single entity bearing immense military power which, as is now obvious, it feels it may use with impunity.  European nations, even as a \\"Union\\", must not develop policy out of resentment for that power.  The United States must realise that the world is a highly diverse place.  Other norms, other interests, other feelings must be regarded seriously.<br /><br />Within a short time, Europe will count almost as many states as the continental USA.  Within a few years, there will be forty nations participating in a European community.  This amalgamation will include, as it already does, former Soviet Bloc nations.  It will reach to the Near East [what Americans call the \\"Middle East\\"], which will likely be a stepping stone to the Far East.  What all these assembling nations will have in common is a large measure of freedom.  The economic and social benefits of joining this organisation will make absolutist governments untenable.  \\"Human rights\\" and environmental protection are already a condition of EU membership.  With the expansion of that standard, says Garton Ash, a positive framework will be in place for further beneficial policies.  The looming question will be whether the United States will follow that lead.  America's consumptive and expansionist power must be curbed from within.  Will it be able to take that step?<br /><br />Garton Ash thinks that's a possible path.  The guide down that track must be  Great Britain.  The \\"Special Relationship\\", established by Churchill [Roosevelt's job was mostly to agree] so derided by many, is a keystone in the bridge between Europe and America.  America's place as the \\"daughter of Europe\\" has been replaced by it being \\"uncle of Europe\\".  Britain can help the United States back on the path to multilateralism it once championed with the formation of the United Nations.  Once that structure is firmly in place, the wealth of the new linkage can be used to break the bonds of poverty leashing so many.  The first step in that regard is the tumbling of another wall, the trade barriers restricting the imports of Third World products.<br /><br />This is a book to be studied, not merely read.  It's not a difficult job, and Garton Ash hasn't wasted a single word in the presentation.  He's an observer of consummate skills and a peerless writer.  The book contains some compelling comparative \\"maps\\" illustrating the way the world is structured in human terms.  They are an intriguing way of imparting the information - even if you need to shed your old geography lessons.  The only lack in this book is failure to offer a way to overcome the established mind-sets of the people who cannot or will not see beyond the path they are on.

Ward, who has produced several excellent works on early life and extinctions, has joined the ranks of the \\"science as personal diary\\" writers.  In this book, which is almost the final volume of a trilogy [The End of Evolution and Rivers in Time], he recounts the years of seeking answers to why nearly all life died 250 million years ago.  The Permian Extinction was a sharp break in life's track, but its causes long eluded explanation.  Ward became a nearly solitary pursuer for an answer.  This account chronicles his quest.<br /><br />There aren't many places left on the planet where Permian rocks may be found.  One of the few, and perhaps the best, is the Great Karoo in South Africa.  A near wasteland of barren valleys and stark hills, it's not a place many visit by choice.  Even Ward, who should be inured to field research, complains bitterly throughout this account of the capricious nature of the place.  There are sudden, intense storms, bitter cold when it should be summery heat, and some bugs.  Ward's scientific reserve is cast off when he describes his encounters with African ticks.  Harsh epithets scatter across the page.  Science accounts rarely invoke the Amazon \\"inappropriate\\"  rule, but this one may be the exception.<br /><br />Although Ward finds the chase difficult, sometimes futile and of extended duration, he gathers his bits of information to construct a plausible scenario.  The first clues are in the rocks.  Upper Permian rock is typically grey or green.  The overlying Triassic sediments are uniformly red.  Why the distinction?  Red implies two elements - iron and oxygen.  Combined, they are the colour we associate with rust.  There are also the patterns in the rocks to consider.  Ward teams with Roger Smith.  Smith has become the leading rock \\"reader\\" in the Karoo.  He can tromp a hillside, declaiming about the ancient environment the sediments represent.  From snow or rain-fed mountains, channel-cutting rivers once changed to torpid braided streams.  Lush vegetation disappeared, to be replaced by simple plants - or none.  The animal life, already known to have disappeared in the seas, is also largely missing.  Why?  More importantly to Ward, how fast did it disappear?<br /><br />Ward, hopping back and forth between Africa and his home, begins teasing out an answer.  Although some would like to credit another cometary disaster, such as helped wipe out the dinosaurs, the answer appears to be more local, if more intense.  Ward concludes that a series of events, some unrelated, depleted the oxygen supply of the planet.  The major cause appears to be a series of momentous volcanic eruptions in Siberia.  Spewing immense quantities of lava accompanied by carbon dioxide and other gases, life's fundamental resource, oxygen, was smothered.  With nothing to breathe, most life died.  The one large species surviving appears to have been a high-altitude inhabitant, able to adapt to the depleted atmosphere.<br /><br />Ward's account is a compelling read - even when he descends to cursing today's living creatures, animal and human alike.  He's a dedicated scientist, even admitting to harbouring an \\"obsession\\" in his sub-title.  This book might have enlarged on the science while diminishing the personal observations a bit, its message remains clear and valid.  There is much to learn about past life in order to consider where ours might be threatened.  The Permian Extinction may seem remote, but recent events in the Indian Ocean suggest a reprise remains a possibility.

Tim Cranmer doesn't quite fulfill the picture.  His \\"rural cottage\\" is an inherited spot of land containing a chapel.  His rose garden is a struggling vineyard.  And Sundays are occupied by visits from his former protege.  Instead of a demure wife to complete the picture, Tim's resident lady is half his age and a composer.  Hardly the picture of a staid bureaucrat out to pasture.  Perhaps all these variations are due to Cranmer being other than a \\"retired civil servant\\" - he's a retired spook.<br /><br />Spies never truly retire.  They may distance themselves somewhat from the sharp end, but there are always loose ends left over and old cases that resurrect themselves.  The dissolution of the Soviet Union was supposed to put ranks of spies from the West [and John Le Carre] out of work.  They were considered poorly adapted to the new conditions.  Le Carre and his literary creations have refuted that notion.  His \\"retired\\" spy becomes enmeshed in a conspiracy of stupendous scope.  It seems his protege, who was a double pretending to spy for the Soviets, is involved in an embezzlement - 37 billion BP, to be exact.  The money is to finance a war of \\"national liberation\\" - a little item of ethnic minorities having faith in their identity.  Their location is in the ramparts of the Caucasus Mountains, where loyalties are fierce, but the population scattered.  Lacking resources, they seem to have convinced Cranmer's double to help finance weapons' purchases.<br /><br />Larry Pettifer, Cranmer's long-term protege, is an intellectual.  He changes ideologies like his socks.  A consummate wheeler-dealer, he duped his Soviet minders for many years.  What effect did his most recent case officer have to change him?  And where does Tim's resident consort, who disappears mysteriously, fit in to the picture?  Emma finds Larry charming, but his flighty personality and behaviour seem inconsistent for a woman yearning for stability.  Has she fled from security to embrace adventure?  What price will Tim pay to recover her?<br /><br />The Western powers seek stability as well.  Le Carre imparts the view that once the Soviet Empire dissolved, capitalism sought but fresh opportunities for investment.  Justice and enterprise are often at odds, the more so when resources like oil or minerals are involved.  Le Carre has taken up the cause of justice in all his writings, but his more recent ones speak with a more strident voice.  Cranmer is portrayed as a voice of an older generation, quietly pleased that the Soviet Union is moribund.  The issues of the post-Soviet East seem remote.  Le Carre, with his usual skill, portrays a man drawn in by events beyond his control or his ken.  It is easy to sympathise with him.  But it is Pettifer's idealism that speaks for Le Carre.  Never an ideologue, Le Carre's finely wrought narrative confronts us with our own uncaring self-interest.  Capitalism may have triumphed, but the victory isn't without flaws.  An excellent read and a tribute to Le Carre's skills in plot and characterisation.

Both of them were Terry Pratchett.\\"  Having penned this tale and had it lapse into obscurity, Pratchett is impelled by his editors to revive it years later.  Rightly so.  For the dedicated PTerry fan, this example of his early writing is an illuminating read.  Many views expressed in the Discworld books are readily perceived here.  For someone new to Pratchett, it's a great introduction to the scope of his ideas and his writing skills.  For any reader, it's simply a delight to enjoy.<br /><br />The story is a fine example of Pratchett's ability to view the world from a fresh perspective.  If there's a fantasy novel lacking a dark forest and mysterious creatures, i've missed it.  Pratchett, never a formula writer, simply shrinks the scope.  His forested world is a thickly napped rug.  Instead of pines or oaks, it's nylon and wool \\"hairs\\".  The creatures are there, the snargs, the hymetors and others - including silverfish, who live under the world.  There are also people - the Munrungs, the Deftmenes and - the Dumii.  They interact, sometimes violently.  Deep down in the pile, these people and their communities are invisible to humans.  Something, however, sends terror through the forest peoples - Fray.  This immensely destructive force topples cities and obliterates villages.<br /><br />Pratchett builds a story of the conflict of respected traditions countered by innovation and invention.  There is an Empire, to which taxes are due.  That means clerks, organisation, regulations.  While the Munrungs have always met the demands for revenue, others have opposed the imposition, hence, the Empire.  Could two such peoples find a common cause?  It seems unlikely, but the best way to unite two dissimilar tribes is having a common enemy.<br /><br />Except for the conflict of good and evil, this story avoids formula approaches to fantasy.  There are many characters, all of them reflected by people around us.  Snibril, a Munrung, stands out but a little from the rest.  One of his attributes is that he suffers sinus trouble.  This isn't normally a heroic virtue, but it proves valuable here.  There's also a philosopher.  Everybody thinks to some extent.  Philosophers are typified by telling about it in an interesting way.  This description, of course, fits Pratchett admirably. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]There are many characters, all of them reflected by people around us.

In the scrub of New South Wales, he's been assigned the supervising of the execution of a bushranger. With no priest present, Adair undertakes the task of providing company, if not consolation, for the doomed raider. Carney, an Irishman like Adair, was a member of a gang led by a renowned leader, Dolan. Dolan, famous for his physical stature and cunning, is of particular interest to Adair. The last survivor of the mob, Carney seeks some level of absolution for his sins, which appear minimal. Frontier justice is always grim and Carney expects no favours from his watcher.<br /><br />As the night progresses, Adair's mind drifts back to his childhood in Ireland. An orphan taken in by a comfortable, if troubled, family, he reflects on his foster parents' son. From early days when Adair was caregiver to Fergus to later, more competitive times, the relationship of the two boys was close. It became strained only as they achieved maturity and Virgilia, a neighbour, becomes a tutor to the pair. Carney, it appears, may be a link to that distant past. A link less remote and vague than the circumstances of the lonely night suggest. Reminiscing may lead to connections both men may not welcome, yet each reaches tentatively for the other regardless of the outcome. The dynamics of this tale are intense and compelling.<br /><br />In Australia, there's a long-standing tradition of the \\"bush ballad\\" - a mix of fable, poetry and music. The ballads reflect the stark, unforgiving land and the lives of the people coping with it. The verses are wistful with longing for better times and places, yet reflect the \\"battler's\\" striving to overcome adversity. Malouf's prose reflects that tradition in both style and content. He's parsimonious with words, yet precise and vividly descriptive. He's presented us with a story of profound depth and wide-reaching scope, yet managed it within an astonishing few pages. No words are wasted, but each conveys the fullest meaning within the story. Malouf is a masterful writer, and this book will long stand as a sterling example of his abilities.

Where science journalism was once an effort to bring often arcane material to a wider reading public, there is a new approach - debunk science whenever possible.  Budiansky, in his opening to this book, is quite open about his agenda.  Science, particularly the studies of animal behaviour, is actually driven by New Age animal protection schemes.  This must come as a shock to those who have spent years of field and laboratory work trying to understand why various animals, including humans, act as they do.<br /><br />Budiansky takes us through numerous animal studies, particularly that of primates.  His theme is begun with the story of a zoo gorilla who purported(ly?) \\"saved\\" a child.  That the media hype over this story is based on the fallacious assumption that these huge animals are a threat to humans never seems to have occurred to him.  He is only concerned over whether it is \\"natural\\" for gorillas to \\"save\\" children.  Are scientists, as Budiansky charges, over enthusiastically applying human values to our animal relatives?<br /><br />From a false starting point, he continues with copious accounts of behaviour studies.  Each is presented as if the research teams had claimed far more than they actually have done.  This is precisely the kind of selective quotations technique others have used in attempting to refute evolution by natural selection.  It's the use of whole paddocks of straw creatures that clearly lack substance or value.  It also demonstrates that Budiansky is devoid of understanding how science works.  Research builds up snippets of information from a great deal of work.  In cognition, we're still learning to ask the proper questions, never mind the completeness of the answers.<br /><br />The book goes on to address the issues of animal \\"self-awareness\\", deception, forms of communication and, of course, pain.  Since he's keen to refute those seeking greater protection for animals other than ourselves, it's important to Budiansky to limit any meaning to any of these concepts.  The irony in all this is that he attributes other animals with talents such as mapping, distance assessment, deception, survival strategies and other attributes without granting these traits any real value.  The book is filled with self-contradictions which neither Budiansky nor his editor appear to have noticed.  It's as if the manuscript was typed, then rushed into print to meet a deadline.<br /><br />Budiansky's \\"references\\" make abundantly clear that he's failed to consult the more prominent animal behaviourists.  John Alcock, Thomas Eisner or Bernd Heinrich are noticeably absent from the list.  He gives Seyforth and Cheney [\\"How Monkeys See the World\\"] lengthy coverage, only to lambaste them for misrepresenting their findings.  He cites Daniel Dennett frequently, but in doing so simply adopts a limited definition of consciousness from what he's used elsewhere in the book.  While he claims to have a handle on the evolutionary roots of behaviour, it's clear he has no real grasp of the development of cognition.  When he arrives at language, of course, he soars with flowery rhetoric.  There's no doubt that language gives humans a special cognitive ability.  Does that thus relegate the rest of the animal kingdom to a subordinate role in life?  Budiansky thinks so, and wants his readers to follow his lead.  It's a false trail.

They became land animals - a lineage of them became us.  Yet, looking at life in the sea, the emergence of life on land seems rather narrowly focussed.  In the sea there are ten-armed squid, eight-armed octopi and five-legged starfish.  Except for insects and spiders, nearly all land life from tiny shrews to the immense dinosaurs are formed on a consistent pattern.  We're all four-limbed - we're tetrapods.  How did that come about?<br /><br />In this excellent synopsis of the life in the ancient seas, Carl Zimmer examines not only the animals living there, but the wide variety of environments the sea offers.  Where, he asks, would life have found the most advantages?  If you have some knowledge of physical limitations about salinity, pressure at depth and vision, the answer seems easy.  If you don't, Zimmer carefully explains about the need for sunlight, limited pressure tolerance and available food.  This location turns out to be in the shallow zones close to land.  The shallow areas of the sea are the tidal zones, and it was there that a particular form of fish achieved particular success.  These creatures - the lobe-finned fishes - had capability in changing environments.  They may not have flashed through the water like marlin or tuna, but they could manuever when the tide fell.  The lobe fin was comprised of a set of bones ending in five final extremeties.  Examined closely, they look like a misshapen hand - or paw.  And there's always four of them.<br /><br />These creatures, cumbersome in appearance, still managed to make the transition to a dry environment.  There were more than just klutzy-looking paws involved.  Zimmer explains how the issues of breathing, digestion, body covering and other factors would all need adjustment to the land environment.  Zimmer labels these changes \\"macroevolution\\".  He uses the term to show how body elements changing required interaction among several areas to become a successful organism adapted to a new realm.  Jawbones open or merge, skulls lengthen or grow wide, legs shift in position.  And teeth?  Ah, there's the real pointer to what land animals modified to survive.<br /><br />Just when Zimmer has his subjects firmly established in forest and veldt, he must follow some of them back to the sea.  The giant sea creatures known as cetaceans were a mystery even prior to Darwin's time.  Darwin himself, perplexed by what mechanism could have brought these immense mammals back to their remote origins, offered one solution.  Zimmer relates Darwin's idea that a swimming bear-like creature made the transition.  Both Darwin and Zimmer acknowledge how unlikely that scenario is.  What did take place, however, was unknown for over a century.  After numerous false pointers, the precursors of whales turned out to be a low-slung wolf-like animal from what is now Pakistan.  Phil Gingerich, scrambling about streamside cliffs in that country, produce Pakicetus.  Ears and teeth became the focal point of research in early whales.  The change from atmospheric to water hearing, including the trick of echolocation, traces how land animals returned to the sea.  Changes in diet are reflected in how teeth are shaped and distributed.<br /><br />Zimmer's account is a lively read, with good accounts of the paleontology and assessment of evidence.  There are excellent line drawings to illustrate the various creatures discussed.  As a science writer of excellent reputation, he graces the text with good footnotes and references, tucked away at the back.  A fine study in a dynamic field.

What is the definition of \\"consciousness\\"?  Brooks examines these questions in some detail in this book that challenges many assumptions about \\"what makes us human\\" and where that might lead.  He examines many facets of tool-making, that feature that supposedly set us off from the other animals.  From simple tools he moves to the beginnings of computing and how that mathematical science has been transformed into a mechanical one.  Computers are now used to control various devices in many ways.  As machine complexity developed, the computers granted machines new levels of independence.  Control of machines, once reliant on human intervention, has become autonomous.  Autonomous machines, he reminds us, are referred to as \\"robots\\".<br /><br />Robots have a long history in literature.  Although Brooks strangely omits the origin of the term in Karel Capek's \\"Rossum's Universal Robots\\" of 1920, he pays understandable homage to Asimov's robotic series.  From \\"I, Robot\\" onward, robots have been deemed harmless due to Asmiov's Three Laws of Robotics.  While designed to allay the fears of the public over human-like mechanical devices, Brooks points out the Laws have little likelihood of implementation.  He cites HAL's murderous antics in \\"2001\\" as a counter-example.<br /><br />These literary allusions are but background to what Brooks considers truly important.  Robots are already among us performing significant tasks in factories and other facilities, including medical roles.  The boundary between fantasy and reality will be sundered, he claims.  Robotics and \\"artificial intelligence\\" have made substantial gains in recent years.  He traces the development of \\"Ghengis\\", \\"Cog\\" and other robots, some \\"complete\\" body plans, others comprising combinations of visual and tactile.  All of these are experiments in sensitivity, reaction and control under various environments.  Some seem to communicate well, or respond to human attention as if \\"conscious\\".  Brooks makes no extravagant claims for the \\"consciousness\\" of these robots.  They are, he stresses, but steps in a forward direction.<br /><br />The question then becomes, where will these steps lead?  Brooks shows how robot experiments can lead from lab to home.  There are already \\"pet\\" robots - artificial \\"dogs\\" and dolls.  Even lawns may now be mown by unattended robots randomly wandering about the yard.  House cleaning robots will follow, with different types dealing with various tasks.  With every improvement in capability and independent programming, will robots \\"replace\\" humans?  Brooks contends this scenario is impossible.  The image of \\"self-creative\\" robots is a fantasy.  More significantly, he endorses the notion of robotic replacement body parts.  These are already in place as pacemakers and prosthetics.  As they improve, the boundary between \\"flesh and machines\\" will blur.  The integration will not reduce our humanity, he contends, but will give us greater acceptance of the \\"machine\\" as a bestower of a better life.  To Brooks, this is a logical evolutionary step for humans to take.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]s if \\"conscious\\".

It might be considered the guidebook for the movement to end the fallacy of the United States' involvement in Viet Nam.  So abrupt was Heller's rise to prominence with that novel that his previous work was nearly lost to view.  This collection restores somewhat our sense of how Heller developed as a writer.  From the time of his discharge from the Air Force to \\"Catch-22\\" eight short stories were published.  That they faded from perception can best be attributed to the blazing popularity of the novel and the social upheaval occuring during the ensuing years.<br /><br />The editors have gleaned this collection from among Heller's published and unpublished works ranging from 1945 to 1990.  This anthology is a mix of fiction and social essays, giving us a good insight into Heller's experiences, thinking and writing skills.  The latter are particularly demonstrated in their growth from his early stories through his descriptions of \\"Catch-22\\" in its writing and filming.  The stories and essays are grouped into those published and those left unseen.  There is also the one-act play derived from a character in \\"Catch-22\\", \\"Clevinger's Trial\\".  The play is highly derivative of Heller's view of military procedures and \\"justice\\" in assessing its own.  Given that, however, little of the novel's spirited style is exhibited here.  Excellent narrative style, but little of the incisive wit is displayed.  Those who have read \\"Catch-22\\" might be led to believe this is not the same writer.<br /><br />The editors open with excerpts from \\"Now and Then\\" in which Heller credits writings of the \\"urban school\\" of William Saroyan, Irwin Shaw and Studs Lonigan.  There is little doubt, however, that Heller was his \\"own man\\" when he wrote, as this collection verifies.  From the opening story of a returning soldier's homecoming, through a sequence of tales about New York characters, Heller transmits his ability to record human foibles.  The stories are intense and compelling, not the least of which is the life of an addict.  In \\"A Man Named Flute\\", Heller acknowledges the concern of parents during the post-war years when the drug trade entered an expansionary phase.  Among my favourite pieces is the imaginary resignation of George Bush from the Presidency - and that's the first one!<br /><br />Yossarian, that incomparable survivor from \\"Catch-22\\" returns to these pages still struggling to stave off the inevitable.  Also inevitable is to compare Yossarian with Heller.  Heller's penetrating eye and scathing pen are vividly present in \\"Yossarian Survives\\" as well as in the play.  He also turns his gaze on the site of his former Corsican airfield in \\"Catch-22 Revisited\\" and in depicting the making of the film.  He also recapitulates his career as a bombardier in the Mediterranean.<br /><br />This is a fine collection from a leading American author.  Those enamoured of the short story format will be amply rewarded by adding this anthology to their collection.  Heller is lamentably gone, and his replacement has yet to appear.

404275:US	50941451	R1VZWS8XYT5QA7	1893554937	908224304	Taking Sex Differences Seriously	Books	5	52	67	N	N	Rebutting rhetoric	We should all applaud the generation of feminist rhetoric and bombast we've endured.  The repeated charge that \\"patriarchal\\" society has kept women in a subdued role has led to a wealth of studies investigating that assertion's validity.  The result has been the generation of a string of books granting us enlightenment.  We are beginning to find out just who we are as a species.  Rhoads' fine book is an assemblage of many of these studies, organised and presented with clarity and verve.  The message is: men and women aren't \\"the same\\" and that the differences go deeper than mere plumbing.  We need to understand what distinguishes men and women.  We then need to apply that knowledge realistically.<br /><br />The difference in brain functions between men and women have long been known.  Rhoads shows that those distinctions are expressed in behaviour patterns.  Men don't act the same as women, nor should they be expected to.  The approach to sex and relationships, no matter how much women have tried to feminise men, are by very diverse routes.  The male genetically-urged drive to spread their genes is fundamental.  To deny or disparage this, as many feminist writers have done, is self-defeating.  It has led to grave misunderstandings and worse judgements.  Rhoads wants this outlook rectified - which can be accomplished by \\"taking sex differences seriously\\" through a more scientific approach.  Ironically, the thrust of this research has been done by women wishing to confirm the feminist rhetoric, which they found refuted by empirical data.<br /><br />Rhoads outlines the many findings of behavioural differences among men and women across many cultures.  Although little in human behaviour is firmly \\"hard-wired\\" into our genetic definition, there clearly are patterns manifested from our evolutionary past.  Mate selection is, of course, the most visible of these traits.  While men are concerned about youth, symmetry and \\"beauty\\", these aren't cultural artefacts or \\"constructs\\", but signals of health.  Women are naturally concerned with sustained resources to support family needs.  The \\"powerful\\" man not only represents physical strength, but likely social status as well.  In many societies, that means economic security and family stability for the woman, Rhoads notes.<br /><br />The key evidence in many of the studies Rhoads cites is the emergence of different behaviour traits in children.  No matter how many parents or teachers of primary grades attempt to feminise boy children, the male preferences will emerge whenever allowed.  Young boys will play together, roughhouse, and express aggressive tendencies while little girls will gather and converse.  These traits emerge at far too young an age to be the product of \\"patriarchal culturalism\\", Rhoads notes.  A young boy, deprived of toy guns, demands one as a gift at the first opportunity.  Rhoads reminds us, if we needed it, that the \\"culture wars\\" are about women's roles, not men's.<br /><br />This \\"battle of the sexes\\" is far from over, Rhoads contends.  The battleground remains in the worst possible location - the classroom.  While he briefly notes that public school attempts to feminise boys has \\"backfired\\", his real concern is with collegiate athletics.  For the past thirty years publicly funded education has struggled to end \\"sexual discrimination\\" in university sports.  Known as \\"Title IX\\", the provisions of these regulations have led to the dismantling of a significant portion of these competitive activities.  What has replaced them is a \\"women's athletics\\" programme which is fully funded, under-utilised version of \\"equality\\".  These programmes simply ignore the distinctions between men and women on competitive activities, whether sports, business or other fields.  Women, of course, are better where competition isn't the measure of success, as the number of women executives abandoning office for home indicates, Rhoads notes.  The law and educational regulators have failed to note these \\"serious differences\\", or unthinkingly dismiss them.<br /><br />All this said, Rhoads makes clear he doesn't make simple distinctions between males and females.  In fact, he postulates the notion of a general description for males, but females are divided into two basic types.  The division is mediated by long-term evolutionary unfolding of hormone secretion - chiefly testosterone, estrogen and oxytocin.  These chemicals influence a wide range of behaviour traits, from aggression to nursing.  Vigorous testing programmes have shown which of these neurohormones are present in varying conditions.  Subject reactions even show feedback loops in which initial activities lead to greater expression of the hormones to intensify the activity.  Women may become masculinised by enhanced levels of some hormones, but the loss of it doesn't \\"feminise\\" men.  The key is in the level of aggression exhibited.<br /><br />It's simple, if not simple-minded, to criticise works such as Rhoads' as \\"just-so\\" stories or \\"soft science\\".  The accumulating evidence suggests this view is merely special pleading.  The studies Rhoads sites are from across cultures and through the ranks from blue-collar workers to corporate executives.  The bibliography alone is sufficient indication of the scope and depth of studies Rhoads relied on.  This book is required reading for a wide range of people - from parents and teachers to regulators and enforcers.  There is much to be learned and acted on.  A fine starting point for change.

His first answers seem unfitting with references to \\"puzzling\\" and contentious.  As the book develops, however, it becomes clear that the life of early humans bears strongly on our life today.  The profession is richly rewarding, therefore, in the most human sense.  Peregrine is prompt to point out the multi-discipline approach to the study of prehistory nearly excludes the term \\"archaeologist\\" as it's normally understood.  Prehistory now includes environmental, ethnological, botanical and other sciences collaborating to produce a portrayal of human life over a vast stretch of time.<br /><br />Peregrine explains how the study of human prehistory is done and what students might expect from both course and field work.  The field work is typified by four elements: artifacts, \\"ecofacts\\", fossils and \\"features\\".  \\"Ecofacts\\" are the evidence portraying conditions at sites in ancient times.  It's a fairly new means of analysis and an invaluable aid in filling in details not otherwise apparent.  \\"Features\\" are the kinds of evidence that depict a locale or a lifestyle, but cannot become museum artifacts - footprints, hearths and other human generated changes in the natural environment.<br /><br />None of that information can be viewed in its proper context without an understanding of how human evolution unfolded.  Peregrine provides a good summary of the path humanity has taken over the two million years of the book's title.  He explains the development of bipedalism and its contribution to human dispersal from Africa to the rest of the Eurasian landmass, thence to Australia and the Pacific.  Movement was accompanied by fossils and artifacts, and Peregrine diagrams the important clues in physiology and tool making.<br /><br />The diaspora of humanity becomes the theme of the remainder of the book.  With the number of sites now being excavated, the author moves from a chronological presentation to a regional arrangement.  Given that most of his students are North American, the focus begins there, moving to Africa, then into Asia.  As settlements developed, from mere encampments to significant communities, the evidence of our progression toward today's world was laid down.  Huts, cooking fires, storage and living places leave their marks in the ground and Peregrine leads us on a tour of various sites.  These all provide lessons in how to find and expose the information that illuminates how our ancestors lived.  And died.  Peregrine presents the information clearly and effectively.  It's hardly \\"dry\\" or pedantic in style.<br /><br />A number of features enhance this textbook, not the least being the associated web site.  Regrettably, the publisher has restricted access mostly to students and instructors registered for the course.  The \\"Media Lab\\" videos [in QuickTime] are postage stamp sized and it's difficult to discern detail.  The book itself is richly illustrated with photographs, diagrams and maps.  These are well associated with the text material, providing a ready visual reference to data.  A colour photo section provides vivid images of sites, artefacts and examples of dig sites.  A substantial bibliography is included, with a glossary to assist in term definition and use.  An excellent book for the starting student.  It's only real shortcoming is the publisher's decision to open each chapter with yellow text on white paper, leading the reader to jump to the next page to start reading.<br /><br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]s now being excavated, the author moves from a chronological presentation to a regional arrangement.

There are two excellent writers who have carved a significant niche in the fantasy field.  Terry Pratchett is one, and Barry Hughart the other.  Both have inventive minds, produce wonderfully exotic places and introduce us to characters no \\"mainstream\\" author would dare venture.  Where Pratchett creates new places, Hughart devises a time that \\"never was\\" in a real place - China.  This story of an imaginary China has every exemplary feature in fantasy - mystery, adventure, romance.  It adds to these formulaic items a cast even Hollywood would be pressed to match.  And, in twenty years since this book was published, has notably failed to do so.  Perhaps it's just as well, because Hughart's excellence in story and character would be hard to portray in Hollywood terms.<br /><br />Hughart's tale of a quest to find a cure surpasses anything in the fantasy genre.  A group of village children, limited in age range, has been struck down by a plague.  \\"How can a plague count?\\" asks the local abbot.  The children aren't dead, but in a coma.  Perhaps a knowledgeable man would know of a cure.  Lu Yu, \\"Number Ten Ox\\", the strong tenth son of a peasant, is sent to find such a sage.  He turns up Li Kao, a venerable sage \\"with a slight flaw in his character\\".  We think the \\"slight flaw\\" is his thirst for wine, but that proves too simple.<br /><br />Number Ten Ox carries Li Kao to various places in China seeking the Great Root of Power - a ginseng root endowed with great curative traits.  Along the way, the duo encounter the Ancestress, an immense woman of immense powers of her own.  They deal with the mind-reading Duke of Ch'in, whose name was adopted by the West to describe all of China.  Some lesser characters, Miser Chen, Henpecked Ho, and Doctor Death make their appearances, seemingly transitory.  And Number Ten Ox falls in love.  He adores the lady Lotus Cloud who has a bizarre preference for lovers that provide her with jade and pearls.<br /><br />Through all the adventures, no few of which are more than life-threatening, Number Ten Ox carries the image of the suffering children in his mind.  It would be simple for him to turn away from the memory of their sleeping figures, but Ox is true to the quest.  So long as he maintains his desire to cure them, Li Kao is retained to help.  But it's far from clear which is driving which, since the Venerable Sage has developed his own quest - what is the meaning of a child's game verse?  How does it affect all of China?  Li Kao's drive for answers readily equals Ox's search for a cure for the plague.<br /><br />Hughart's stylistic quirks and sinuous plotting twists keeps this book a enchanting read.  He places his protagonists in various quandaries, confronting them with dangers and delights.  Li Kao's wine-sodden brain should leave him helpless, but he contrives to extricate the pair with penetrating analyses of each threat.  At the end, when he must unravel the most fundamental mystery, what The Bridge of Birds is, he's more concerned with why he couldn't work out the solution sooner.  But if he had, there wouldn't be a fine 278 page sequence to enjoy!

They aren't on an exercise regime.  Instead, they reveal the ancient and simple roots upon which our bodies and personalities rest.  Their aim is to make you \\"bioliterate\\" - to gain the ability to understand why there is unity in all life, including ourselves.  Their technique examines the mechanisms of DNA, the ubiquitous molecule that extends across the living community.  The authors show how DNA's working portions, the genes, act to build organisms, from the minuscule not-quite-alive viruses to complex creatures like us.  They structure their presentation into three views \\"close up, at midrange and from a distance\\".  Each view is dependent on understanding the earlier picture as complexity of the organisms described increases.  The Barash father-daughter pair present a highly descriptive and readable account of life's processes and why it's important to us to understand them.  They stress that many of the topics reviewed here remain obscure, needing readers to continue the quest they've charted.<br /><br />Opening their account with a detailed examination of DNA's mechanism for making proteins, the basic process of an organism's structure and life operations.  They show how understanding genes provides information on a wide variety of subjects.  They examine such diverse topics as DNA \\"fingerprinting\\", growth and development and how errant patterns can result in various afflictions - such as \\"mad cow\\" disease.  They move to the world of viruses, how they are built and propagate - and how the same molecule that allows virus replication to also mount defenses against them.  In their discussion, they raise questions about the body's reaction to viral infection - is sneezing or coughing a mechanism these tiny organisms imparted to us in order to help them spread?<br /><br />From the \\"recipe for life\\" molecule of DNA, the Barashes reveal the world of the cell.  Where did it come from?  Why are there parts of the cell that seem to lead an almost independent existence, while operating within the cell?  The authors show how cells have programmed life cycles of their own.  They remind us that the cell is \\"born\\", goes through a series of steps at varying paces, then \\"dies\\".  How are cells chosen to build particular parts of the body, giving us individuality while following a basic \\"standard pattern\\".?  All members of a species look generally alike, yet each is an individual.  These minor differences reflect how evolution has tailored life to adapt to change.  They remind us that only one type of cell in the body never replicates itself.  Muscle cells can shrink or enlarge, but new ones aren't made.<br /><br />Without doubt, the most informative chapter in the book is on the brain and nervous system.  This section emphasises how many of our emotions and other behaviour traits are rooted in the mass of nerve cells within the brain and connecting to the remainder of the body.  Unlike the lumpy body cell, the neurons are lengthy whip-like structures designed for rapid interaction with other neurons.  Almost like the muscle cell, brain cells rarely replicate.  What you attain during the first years of living and developing the brain will remain with you for life.  Unlike muscle cells, the brain's neuronal net don't enlarge or contract.  Instead, new information may displace or divert older data stored in the neurons.  And the brain, of course, is constantly acquiring new information.<br /><br />Still in the \\"middle view\\", the authors examine that great mystery - sex.  They explain how the mechanism of reproducing ourselves reaches back to that DNA of the early chapters.  \\"Gene shuffling\\" has numerous long-term advantages to any species utilising it.  This process of mixing genes from two parents provides unique individual offspring - just what natural selection needs to select from.  It also contributes to the body's mechanisms for combating infection.  In effect, when an egg is fertilised, part of the on-going process is to reprogramme the immune system almost from scratch.  The high speed adaptability of infective agents such as viruses is countered by our individuality.  It's more than just brown eyes or blue!  Finally, the authors look at how the body acquires and utilises energy to keep these processes functioning.  Successful energy conversion provides the framework for successful reproduction.<br /><br />In the final segment, the authors place the human species firmly within the panorama of all Nature.  They stress the interconnectedness of all living things.  The sharing of DNA is the signal that our role cannot be separated from the remainder of life.  The planet runs on an \\"energy budget\\" of which we are a significant part.  They describe how \\"food webs\\" are composed of \\"trophic levels\\" - in plain, but undescriptive language - the \\"food chain\\".  There is, they remind us, much more to food webs than who consumes what.  Energy material must be processed through cyclical steps.  Interrupting those processes, such as by modifying gas content of the atmosphere or raising ambient temperatures, is dangerous to our species and others.  \\"Everything Touches Everything Else\\", they remind us.  The lesson is that if we don't start to understand life, we won't have it to enjoy.  \\"Dare to know\\" where you fit in the natural world and understand what roles you may enjoy and which may need to avoid.

Actually, it's a bit depressing to reflect on the number of trees felled in convincing certain Christians that their notion of life is false.  We can forgive Scott her use of more paper.  She has produced the most effective and comprehensive work on why evolution is our guide to the natural world to date.  Her organisation is excellent and presented in a clear, effective prose style.  With her objectives so well outlined and stated, Scott offers a useful synopsis of the struggle educators face in dealing with the creationist crisis.<br /><br />Scott breaks her presentation into a triad of subjects: science and how it works, the multi-pronged counter-attack of Christians on Darwin and other scientists, and what creationist writers say about evolution by natural selection.  The opening section is a vivid presentation of scientific methods and the avoidance of dogma.  Science, Scott declares, is \\"truth without certainty\\".  Science is more than a \\"collection of facts\\", but it is the analysis of facts to explain the universe we inhabit.  Scott shows how science's lack of absolutes results in a cleft Christians use as an entry point in their attempts to refute science from astronomy to zoology.  Their main thrust, however, remains our biological heritage.<br /><br />In the second part of her book, Scott traces the history of thinking about the universe and life on Earth.  She makes clear that \\"stasis\\" wasn't the theme adhered to by early thinkers.  Variety was in evidence, but poorly understood.  The Aristotelian \\"ideal\\" became the standard by which life and its processes were considered.  Change was obvious and during the Enlightenment the means of bringing it about over time was sought.  From \\"special creation\\", which many Christians adopted as a supernatural mechanism to explain change, to Lamarck, who thought living things changed traits during their lifetime, a means for explaining the evidence was sought.  Once Darwin provided the real insight into life's mechanism, confirmed by the fossils and genetic evidence alike, change was seen as essential for life to proceed.  Christians, fearful that natural selection would undermine their view of divine origins, if not of life, then at least of humanity, have challenged evolution on a wide, but constantly shifting, front.<br /><br />In presenting their case as completely as possible, Scott is forced to reveal that a significant bloc of Christian contenders against \\"evolution\\" refused to allow their works to be cited.  It's an interesting conflict when the assaulting force suddenly vanishes.  Their presence is still made visible by Scott's other sources reviewing their publications.  Compounding her task is the reality of \\"creationism's\\" almost infinite spectrum of views.  They stretch from those accepting Ussher's date origin of the universe six thousand years ago to those accepting all of science's findings from cosmology to human evolution, but who still insist a deity is \\"the originator of it all\\".  That's a wide range to address, but Scott pairs these expressions with counter findings in nature.  The book concludes with a string of creationist writings answered by scientists in appropriate fields.<br /><br />The book is a fine summation of positions and meets well its subtitle of being \\"An Introduction\\" to the issues.  Her references are by chapter, always a useful means of focussing on topical entries rather than a general bibliography where you must search for the appropriate entry.  There is a fair amount of material on legal decisions and school board pronouncements.

412197:US	50941451	ROKUX5I41VRJH	0393058360	665022244	Fear's Empire: War, Terrorism, and Democracy in the Age of Independence	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Anxieties and absurdities	A couple of centuries ago, essayists voiced opinions in newspapers or pamphlets.  Some, hidden in anonymity, could counsel protest and sedition.  Today's freer societies allows the writer to drop a mask hiding identity. Voicing opinions openly is easier.  The downside is that it may take a whole book.  And the problems appear to be looming far larger than they were long ago.  Examining foundation causes takes more ink.  In this insightful study, Benjamin Barber applies the best essayist's style to address the issues underlying today's American expansionism.  A nation that once based its relationship with other nations on the promise that it would never start a war, has adopted an unilateral adventurist role.  And that new identity has far outstripped in time and scope any historical precedent.  The entire globe is threatened with becoming \\"Americanised\\".  Why should that be happening?<br /><br />With clear, incisive prose Barber examines the roots of the values held in the United States and how those are being manifested in its \\"foreign policy\\".  Once, it was important to Americans that society be governed by \\"the rule of law\\".  This commonly-used and nearly trite phrase reflected both the foundation of compromise among the States embodied in the US Constitution and in how Americans interacted with other nations.  The attitude created a sense of moral superiority to American dealings with other nations - an attitude Barber labels \\"exceptionalism\\".  This high sense of self-worth carried the American population across the continent.  Who else could coin a term like \\"Manifest Destiny\\" to sweep aside indigenous peoples in creating a contiguous empire?<br /><br />Once the North American landmass was occupied, according to Barber, the United States could sit smugly isolated from the remainder of the planet.  Two global conflicts, which the Americans viewed in absolutist terms, eroded the notion of \\"isolationism\\", but didn't erase the concept of \\"exceptionalism\\".  With the high moral fervour it adopted in pursuing two world wars, the United States has entered on an expansionist programme, accellerated by the attack on the World Trade Centre.  That assault gave the Republican incumbent administration the impetus to use fear in two directions - within the United States and beyond its borders.<br /><br />Are Bush's foreign policies derived from his cabal of \\"neo-con\\" advisors?  Barber dismisses that notion.  Bush, he says, is sufficiently motivated by a strong belief in America's \\"missionary rationales\\" and \\"exceptional virtue\\".  With the power available to enforce those values elsewhere, Barber demonstrates how Bush is able to divide the world into \\"Manichean camps\\" of good and evil.  From that stance the President has convinced enoughAmericans that foreign intervention is just and proper.  It allows him to sacrifice troops in a flawed campaign to force democracy in Iraq at gunpoint while retaining domestic support.  Using fear at home allows Bush to instill fear abroad.  Barber insists that all that military might driven by a sense of dread, real or manufactured, is a threat to global security.  If American hegemony isn't sustainable in today's conditions, what can restore stability?<br /><br />Barber reminds his readers of US leadership in forming the United Nations.  He notes that the theme of \\"internationalism\\" of the post-WWII era was too vague and utopian.  The fear of eroded \\"national sovereignty\\", he argues, should be replaced by a new, pragmatic idea - \\"interdependence\\".  Interdependence recognises that all nations have their own interests.  Like the collection of States making up the US, Barber's proposed framework would work through mutual respect and compromise.  Bush's assault on Afghanistan and Iraq shows how far the US has moved from its post-war ideals.  \\"Independence\\", as currently expressed in the US' exceptionalist framework, is a false mythology.  Barber wants it replaced by a realistic outlook.  \\"Pax Americana\\", reflective of the \\"Pax Romana\\" of the Roman Empire, is unsustainable.  It is nothing more than an expression of power which must ultimately fail.<br /><br />If we must adopt labels, Barber argues, then let us adopt \\"lex humana\\" or a rule of law for all people.  Barber suggests the US learn to cope with \\"preventive democracy\\" - variations of the American model applicable to different cultures.  He offers examples of democratic societies that aren't blind imitations of what the US practices.  For numerous reasons, other societies cannot simply copy the US blueprint.  They must build with their own materials and plans to build similar structures of equal strength.  The only aspect of this book lacking is the mechanism by which one man might be convinced to shed the false mythologies he's operating under - and dragging the American people with him.

In this case, the hole is realism and the peg, the supernatural.  Haught, who should know better, attempts to impart an outline of evolution by natural selection through self-dialog.  His method is to place himself as a practicing Christian on the one side, and responding as a Christian historian of science on the other.  He is thus able to ask himself a series of almost pertinent questions [he never really poses the most important one] and respond in an apparently knowing manner.  The supernatural peg, however, cannot be driven into the aperture of reality.  With all his good intentions and carefully crafted words, Haught fails address the real problem.<br /><br />The questions are reasonable enough, and often heard.  This assumed authenticity gives a patina of value to the book.  His opening salvo sets the tone, asking why evolution is \\"such a religiously troubling idea\\".  Haught's response is to simply negate that assertion with Augustine - change over time is possible.  Citing \\"Church Fathers\\" as authorities isn't a promising start.  He continues by examining \\"Darwin's Revolutionary Idea\\" [he doesn't concede Dennett's phrase until later in the book] as challenging traditional views.  Traditional, in Haught's view, doesn't mean \\"absolute\\".  That, of course, permits science, which Haught tries to admire through the book, to push his deity further away from human context.  In effect, this book, starting with Darwin instead of Copernicus, traces the displacement of \\"the Creator\\" from up close and personal to increasingly remote and detached.  Each question Haught poses is designed to drag the Desert Deity [just the one, please note] back into Nature's processes in some guise or another.  Even if it's no more than a \\"sense\\" or \\"presence\\", the deity must be acknowledged at some level.  It's hard to imagine a more contrived appeal to special pleading.<br /><br /> Haught wants to be considered an \\"authority\\" on natural selection by providing answers to his imaginary questioners.  He cites Gould, E. O. Wilson and, of course, de Chardin.  Even William Hamilton's shade is enlisted, to burnish Haught's certification.  Richard Dawkins and his \\"philosophical supporter\\", Daniel C. Dennett are grudgingly acknowledged a role in expounding on \\"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\\" - where we finally arrive on page 77 - but are dismissed as \\"atheists\\".  Dawkins, of course, becomes the bete noire of Haught's presentation.  Not only is Dawkins more insightful on how evolution works, he asks the question Haught ignores - where is the evidence for the deity?  Since Haught maintains evidence is irrelevant, we are left with him still pounding away at his supernatural peg.<br /><br />In his struggle to convey his science credentials, Haught manages to answer most of his own questions wrongly.  In his struggle to confound his adversaries, he manages to misquote - or selectively quote - each of them.  His use of \\"buzzwords\\" as \\"scare flags\\" is constant, but intensifies when he perceives he's on weaker ground than usual.  As the book [and the questions] progress, Haught becomes ever more frantic to assert his case.  The deity is there, somewhere - it must be!  All we have to do is figure out where.

Gerard Edelman has engaged in making those discovery journeys for many years.  His stack of published works must stand many centimetres in height.  Yet he has been able to distil all that accumulated material into a brief, highly informative book well designed for the general public.  That is a stupendous task, yet he's achieved it admirably in this excellent book.  In this presentation of human consciousness, Edelman sweeps away much of the mystery.  There have been many books attempting to explain our perception of the world.  A number of them actually result in a more obscuring than enlightening presentation.  Not so in Edelman's case.<br /><br />Using an Emily Dickinson poem to establish the framework for his thesis, the author declares that consciousness resides in the physical brain.  We must understand how that developed, Edelman asserts.  The answer, of course, lies in the evolutionary development of the human brain and how that led to our version of consciousness.  He stresses that we must not discount the cognitive abilities of other animals.  Theirs hasn't achieved the complexity of the human mind, but there are countless hints from theirs as to how ours works.  The development of human consciousness is a process, not something granted to us.  Much of the process occurs in early life, but whether increasing or growing impaired with age, the process never ceases.  Given that condition, Edelman rejects the proposition that the brain is a computer, a structure far too rigid to be equated with our form of consciousness.<br /><br />Building maps of the brain has been one of science's lengthy undertakings.  As details of where brain functions are located emerged, understanding their links to the body grew.  Edelman is quick to point out those \\"areas\\" are dominated by identified functions, but far from limited to them.  The brain is a highly integrated signalling network - Nature's supreme multi-tasking device.  Edelman uses a shorthand term TNGS [Theory of Neuronal Group Selection] to explain the networking process.  Some shorthand is required in explaining a system of millions of cells with trillions of connections.  The appropriateness of Dickinson's aphorism becomes clear as Edelman details the operations of these extensive networks.<br /><br />The book is assertedly Edelman's.  While he doesn't declare that all the findings on brain science are his, neither does he acknowledge who provided the foundation for some of his insights.  References are almost all to William James, American founder of cognitive studies.  His \\"Bibliographic Note\\" is a clear compromise between a full reading list and a teasing call for further reading.  He provides an excellent Glossary, to which the new reader to this field should turn at the outset.  A number of representational diagrams are provided to enhance the text.  In all, Edelman has accomplished his intention - to describe the underpinning of human consciousness in a way we all can comprehend.

Ackerman is masterful in her use of imagery and metaphor.  She is able to convey both research and personal experience in ways that make both seem readily familiar.  With many years' experience and a wealth of contacts to draw upon, she leads us almost trippingly into the great mystery of consciousness.  Will we reach the end of the journey enlightened, confused or hungry for more information?  Will we be dazzled by the science or simply enthralled by the illusions?<br /><br />Ackerman's writing skills are immeasurably captivating.  She has an almost uncanny ability to synopsise or compress a complex quantity of information into a limited space.  In this book, she opens with a brief review of consciousness theories, followed by a tour of the brain's physical domain.  She demonstrates how her own mind is working as a sample readers may use in understanding their own consciousness.  She explains how the brain works along many paths, using varying paces of internal communications.  Whatever we feel about ourselves \\"inside\\", she notes, there is no single, consistent identity that we can focus on for any duration.  There are simply too many influences, both external and internal, affecting how the brain is operating at any given moment.  And for \\"brain\\", Ackerman reminds us, read \\"mind\\".  She's under no delusion that the two may be separated.<br /><br />As Ackerman trips happily over the many treacherous questions besetting those in cognitive sciences, she introduces little asides to keep you entertained.  We learn of \\"Oscar\\", an alligator who wanted to mate with a French horn player.  We follow the journeys of Einstein's brain as researchers struggled to learn what prompted the mathematician's great genius.  Her family tree, a delightful shrub of dislocation, inventive genius and musical interests provides an example.  Ackerman thus qualifies to combine elements to \\"fiddle with words\\".  The family tie is but the surface expression of our deeper evolutionary roots.  The author speculates on why the human brain should have evolved the way it did.  To her, the ability to think about both ourselves and the cosmos around us is \\"one of evolution's bad jokes\\".  Even so, she reminds us, creative ideas are formed in \\"an alchemy of mind\\", which is the positive payoff for our species.<br /><br />Does Ackerman produce the \\"guidebook\\" we need to understand the mind?  The roles of poetry and metaphor are good pointers, but they must be followed beyond what the author offers here.  She relies on her prose skills to obviate the need for illustration.  Another indication of Ackerman's failure to produce a truly useful guidebook is exposed in her bibliography.  Although she constantly congratulates herself on what a fine research job she's done on the book, the Bibliography belies that claim.  There's no mention of Daniel C. Dennett,  although Owen Flanagan's 1992 \\"Consciousness Reconsidered\\" is listed.  Patricia Churchland, although noted in the text, isn't found here.  In short, the reading list is highly selective.  One would have hoped for better at this time.  A highly readable and tantalising introduction, its shortcomings nearly negate its benefits.<br /><br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]provides an example.

What better typifies the role of moving pictures in our lives?  Terry Pratchett performs literary vivesection on the film industry in this classic parody.  He has reached through time and space, exposing the hidden world of film making.  The unreal lives of actors and actresses and the hype accompanying movies in our many local Bijou and Rhoxie Theatres is vividly conveyed in this superb novel.  The film industry has always been an unlikely marriage of art and business.  Yet even the clash of culture and commerce pales against the strength of what \\"popular appeal\\" can invoke.<br /><br />Moving Pictures follows individuals from the population melange of the Discworld's greatest city.  An unseen force entices them from reasonably comfortable lives in Ankh-Morpork to a realm of uncertainty and confusion.  Victor Tuglebend, aspiring almost-wizard, is inexplicably lured to a desolate desert site.  The trees have but one real side, and houses are one type in the front, something else at the back.  He's not certain he wants to stay, but the life is too compelling to leave.  How do you build a career in a new form of communication?  Especially one built on the most unsubstantial foundation of fantasy - and film that explodes.  What actually happens before an imp-inhabited box that transforms a chaos of people, contrived scenery and improbable stories into something we willingly - no, eagerly, shell out hard-earned money to watch?<br /><br />Victor's becomes immersed into the \\"clicks\\" industry  as he deals with all these improbabilities.  As Pratchett builds his story, his expressive genius is given full rein.  He draws cliches from the film industry's giants - Producer Thomas Silverfish is derived from Samuel Goldwyn [born Samuel Gelbfisch] among innumerable others.  In a narrative rich with imagery - exotic dancer Ruby, a Troll, moves around the stage \\"like continental drift with curves\\" - Pratchett traces Victor's increasing awareness of the industry.  An inexplicable force is drawing people to Holy Wood.  It changes the lives of everyone as it's influence permeates the Discworld.  This force builds in vigour and influence.  Its effect seems stronger with actresses.  Victor's co-star, Ginger, is even more vulnerable to its call.  She wants to be the \\"most important person in the world\\".  Who will consider her \\"important\\"?  You?<br /><br />There's a positive side to Holy Wood's mystical powers.  On the Discworld there are many species - trolls, gnomes, dwarves.  Many of these would battle each other on sight.  In Holy Wood, however, they mingle and cooperate.  Getting the click finished, on time and over budget is the commonly held goal.  Tradtitional animosities are set aside to complete the project.  Is the price worth entering the world of delusional images and the admiration of millions?  You must decide that for yourself.  Pratchett will help you settle the question.  And in doing so, will keep you chuckling and reflecting.  An amazing and captivating story.<br /><br />Oh, yes.  That'll be ten A-M cents for the bag of banged grains.  Thank you.  Enjoy the show.

Unlike those who object to weapons research or who claim science doesn't address life's daily problems, the objections are even more fundamental.  The disaffection is a reaction to science's exposure of humanity being an integral part of Nature - \\"Darwinism\\".  The active crusaders in this assault can be counted on the fingers of one hand, but they have been prolific and boisterous in their assertions.  And they are declaring war on education.  They want changes based on religious grounds.  Shanks' counterattack on these destructive forces carefully examines and dissects the arguments asserting life has supernatural origins.<br /><br />The campaign, which has gone through several aliases - \\"Christian creationism\\" and \\"creation science\\" are but two - has settled on the bizarre cognomen of \\"Intelligent Design\\".  This concept rests on a view of today's life.  It is then projected back in time and found too difficult to explain.  According to ID, we can't get there from here.  Life is too complex to have built up from simple beginnings and must be the work of an anonymous \\"designer\\", which, of course, means something spiritual.  Shanks is direct in his condemnation of this notion.  Quite apart from the vapid logic of ID's idea is the failure of its adherents to provide a shred of evidence for their thesis.  It is a shambles of inconsistent views, he demonstrates, often contradictory and its adherents often at cross-purposes.  Shanks' granting it the status of a \\"theory\\" is the one shortcoming in this book.<br /><br />After a brief outline of ID's ancient roots and its proponents in the Muslim world - a novel point overlooked by most scholars - Shanks outlines his themes.  He divides his topics into the realms of biological and cosmological ID views.  The biological is, of course, ID's challenge to Darwin's natural selection concept.  It's difficult to comprehend how anyone could reject the mass of evidence supporting Darwin's idea that have accumulated since \\"Origin\\" was published, but Shanks demonstrates how ID publicists attempt to refute or ignore it.  ID has used the laws of thermodynamics as a bludgeon against natural selection, but Shanks explains the flaws in its arguments.  He deftly exposes the inconsistencies and self-contradictions that ID spokesmen have produced.  Michael Behe's circular debates with Shanks and his colleague Karl Joplin are revealed to be as mistaken as they were in his sadly best selling book.  The works of Behe's cohorts Phillip Johnson and William Dembski are carefully dissected and their mistakes exposed in raw vividness.  They engage in much special pleading, but Shanks counters with gifted eloquence.<br /><br />Perhaps the most far-reaching attempt to project ID is what has become known as the \\"anthropic principle\\".  This idea has caught the imagination of those who recognise evolution has produced the human species.  However, as any cognitive scientist will concede, humans have a unique place in nature.  Our level of consciousness and linguistic abilities lead us to view ourselves in ways different from other animals.  Frank Tipler and John Barrow have proposed that human evolution, unlike any other species, isn't destined to go extinct.  Instead we will continue to evolve indefinitely.  Shanks, who describes this idea as a \\"grotesque science fantasy\\", is understandably dismissive of something so counter to biological reality.<br /><br />The main thrust of ID has always been the introduction of the supernatural as the driving force of life.  Shanks repeated theme is the failure to provide supportive evidence for this claim.  While there are those who contend deities aren't discernible, Shanks nods to their concerns, but demonstates lucidly that the processes of the universe and life are measureable.  It is these very topics which the ID cliqueis attempting to overthrow in American public schools, a tactic Shanks seeks to block.  ID's thesis that \\"materialism\\" erodes \\"moral values\\" are exposed in Shanks' conclusion.  This device is no more than a scare tactic that characterises Darwin and all evolutionary biologists, paleoanthropologists, cosmologists and other researchers as \\"agents of Satan\\" in Henry Morris' terms.  It is hoped that this book will provide an effective counter to such depictions.

McGrath's depiction of \\"atheism\\" demonstrates the validity of that assessment.  Although he restrains his fury over the views of those who deny deities in the early parts of the book, his control erodes as the pages are turned.  By the concluding chapter he's in full rant about those who have the temerity to leave the embrace of Christianity.  In presenting this history of atheist thought in the Western world, he works in purely narrative mode, devoid of any analytical methods.  Atheism, in McGrath's view, is a simple denial of established churches, projected to encompass their foundation, a remote deity.<br /><br />McGrath's book purports to be a history of \\"atheism\\".  From the outset he portrays it as a \\"movement\\" launched during the Enlightenment, later flourishing to a mild degree.  He selects various thinkers who challenged the hegemony of Christianity in Western Europe over a single century - bracketed by the Fall of the Bastille and demolition of the Berlin Wall.  Those dates are either signal flares or red flags to the reader, as McGrath understands well.  The French Revolution, as a logical expression of the Enlightenment, sought to reject the overbearing Christianity France had suffered.  As McGrath notes, both the revolution and the logic failed.<br /><br />The author parades a gallery of \\"atheists\\", critical of the Church.  With so many elements to criticise, they projected beyond Church institutions to its foundation deity.  Among those in the line-up for judgment, McGrath hoists Voltaire, de Sade, Marx and Freud.  If there is one atheist thinker that stands out in this rogues gallery, it is Ludwig Feuerbach.  Feuerbach's analysis of the failings of Christianity became, in McGrath's view, a pillar of non-theist thinking.  Both Marx and Freud, and many between turned to his ideas the most realistic.  Although McGrath incessantly points out Feuerbach's financial difficulties [imposed by a deity?], he cannot help but note his lingering influence.<br /><br />As McGrath warms to his theme, he seizes any opportunity to grant atheism a foundation role where he can discern one.  Freud's psychoanalyis and admiration of Darwin are founded on atheism first and medicine after.  Marx and Lenin's struggle to overcome the flaws of capitalism are driven by the desire to create a \\"godless\\" society.  Finally, of course, the rise of Hitler's Nazi movement are founded on a dream of a society without divine guidance.  Strange then, that McGrath conveniently overlooks Hitler's own \\"bible\\" declaring that in elminating the Jews, he was doing \\"the Lord's work\\".  He also omits mention of Hitler's support from the Vatican.<br /><br />Hitler, Lenin and others who dismisses Christianity and other religions pale into insignificance when McGrath reveals the real devil.  Richard Dawkins, Britain's most eloquent athiest, appears again and again.  McGrath drags Dawkins into view, excoriating the Darwinian's vilification of superstition and contempt of blind faith.  In doing so, he rather overreaches himself.  Accusing a man with a view 4 billion years deep of \\"ignoring history\\" is almost the ultimate irony.  To McGrath, a convert from teen-age atheism, Dawkins refusal to follow his path is the ultimate heresy.  With a reach crossing many borders and the impact he's likely to have on souls instead of just bodies, Dawkins is clearly the more formidable enemy.  Besides, the others are long departed.<br /><br />If there's anything humorous in this book, it's McGrath's attempt to reach the \\"younger set\\" with his reference to \\"spirituality\\" in the Star Trek TV series.  He claims Gene Roddenberry restrained any Christian [he says \\"spiritual\\"] expression on the series.  In doing so, he  neglects to note it was Roddenberry's hope that religious sects would be shelved over the next three centuries.  McGrath compounds this distortion by claiming one character restores a sense of \\"spirituality\\" to the series - Chakotay of ST: Voyager!  The most opportunistic and devious character after Will Riker!  Not an example to hold up for emulation.  In any case, Chakotay's character worships ancestral spirits, one of the many \\"heathen\\" practices Christianity has expended much energy trying to eradicate.<br /><br />In short, this book is just a cry of desperation.  McGrath's focus on \\"atheism\\" as a movement against Christianity reveals a narrowness inexplicable for a man who teaches theology.  McGrath lines up his enemies, mowing them down at the end of each presentation.  As a Christian, he's unable to conceive of individuals finding faith inadequate.  He wants an organisation that he can assault and dismember.  It's not there.  That makes it easy to pick off targets as they arise, but it fails utterly to subdue the notion that Nature shows there is no need for deities.<br /><br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]ality\\" to the series - Chakotay of ST: Voyager!

It made up the stars, drifted between the galaxies, and, combined with nitrogen, composed the atmosphere of our solar system's giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn.  We learned, too, how it combined with oxygen to make our planet's blessing - water.  Oxygen was deemed the life-giver, earning our respect even when we burned things with it in the lab.  That \\"burning\\" is a key element in Lane's treatise.  We're all aware that without oxygen, we cannot live.  On the other hand, too much of this vital element attacks our cells and contributes to the ageing process.  Consequently, we've turned to \\"anti-oxidants\\" in hope of diminishing the negative aspects.  Lane issues a strong cautionary note about this practice, using a strong evolutionary base to build his case.<br /><br />Science has long known that the early Earth had little free oxygen in the atmosphere.  The famous Urey-Miller experiments used a \\"reducing\\" atmospheric environment to build their compounds.  Traditional biology argues that oxygen was emitted by photosynthetic bacteria as a waste product.  Existing life thus had to adapt to this poisonous atmosphere.  Lane challenges this view, describing mechanisms that made early organisms already oxygen tolerant.  He contends that the Last Universal Common Ancestor, a minute organism residing in shallow seas, learned to break water into its component gases, using freed energy.  In striking a balance between using oxygen as an energy source and preventing that energy from consuming the cell, life developed finely honed processes.  Oxygen is more than just used by life, it is constrained and controlled carefully in organic mechanisms.  As life gained in complexity it used oxygen to improve those control processes.  We tamper with them at our peril.<br /><br />The key is in how life deals with \\"free radicals\\".  These compounds steal electrons, which are the basis for life's functioning.  Free radicals have had some bad press in recent years, as Lane reminds us.  There is much available advice about dealing with them and a pharmacoepia of \\"medicines\\" to be had that claim to reduce them or their impact.  Lane argues that the complexity of processes and varying conditions within the body make any claims to deal with them highly suspect.  The bottom line is that we don't have nearly enough knowledge about how the body copes with free radicals to have confidence in any of the suggested therapies.<br /><br />Nearly a quarter of this book focusses on a question confronting us all - ageing.  There have been countless attempts to understand the ageing process, most with the ambition to thwart or delay it.  Their success rate has been notably abysmal, notes Lane.  Approaches range from \\"oxygen pubs\\" to heavy doses of vitamin C.  The author points out that not only is the concentration of oxygen used by each cell miniscule compared to what's available in the atmosphere, the processing system is many levels removed from the source.  The body will use what's needed and scorn the rest.  Flooding the body with oxygen or vitamins is more likely to impose \\"oxygen stress\\" than deliver any real benefit.<br /><br />Lane's thorough analysis makes this book anything but a quick read.  He follows evolutionary paths, historical accounts of research in all aspects of life, and explains organic processes in minute detail.  He presents a complicated and long-term story, but his explanations are rendered with clarity and precision.  It is simple to condemn this book for its wealth of information.  That's the reaction of one seeking simple answers.  It's easier to praise this book for its sweep of both history, precise evolutionary biology and breadth of information on a topic critical to our existence.

Even our common dictionaries use only pejorative words to describe it - \\"heathen\\", \\"hedonist\\", \\"non-religious\\".  Kirsch wants us to understand that \\"no self-respecting pagan\\" would apply such definitions to his own forms of worship.  \\"Paganism\\" has been the subject of harsh propaganda by the monotheistic \\"faithful\\".  These agents of repression viewed worship of deities other than the \\"One True God\\" as just cause for the vilest forms of curtailment, cruelty and murder.  Although we've suffered many centuries of Christian propaganda against the \\"pagans\\", Kirsch is able to sift through the evidence to provide a more reasonable picture.  The pagan world had its blemishes, but in his view, there's no match for the destructive record of Christianity.<br /><br />Kirsch's opening subject may surprise most readers.  He examines the effort of Egyptian pharaoh Akehnaton to establish a monotheistic faith.  Akhenaton's project was to replace the pantheon of Egyptian deities with a \\"One True God\\" in the figure of Aton, the sun god.  Given Egypt's environment, it was a logical choice.  In true monotheistic style, one that would be followed by other monotheists, Akhenaton destroyed the images, references and temples of the previous corps of deities.  Naturally, there was resentment among the populace, but a pharaoh's power was too absolute for a successful counterrevolution.  Although unsuccessful in establishing a lasting monotheistic empire, Akehnaton is recorded as the first ruler to make the attempt.<br /><br />The next attempt was the half-hearted endeavour by the Roman Emperor Constantine.  Kirsch closely examines the myth of Constantine's \\"vision\\" at the battle of Milvian bridge and the emperor's actions after the victory.  Remaining unbaptised until shortly before his death, Constantine is shown as using Christianity to enhance his own power as a ruler.  Skillfully playing many factions like political pawns, Constantine was able to keep himself aloof from religious strife.  As Kirsch notes, more Christians killed each other than were lost during the \\"Persecutions\\" of previous emperors.  Christianity bogged down over the \\"essence\\" of its founder.  The \\"important dipthong\\" of Edward Gibbon became the basis for innumerable slaughters, burnings and suppression of dissenting views.  It was a portent with continuous repetition.  Adolph Hitler's motto of \\"Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Fuerher\\" was presaged by Constatine's \\"One God, One Empire, One Emperor\\".<br /><br />Almost in response to Constatine's vague conversion was the career of his nephew, Julian.  Kirsch explains how Julian, a survival of the slayings of his relatives as Christian pretender challenged his Christian rivals, was raised in exile.  In his training, he encountered classical philosophers.  With the \\"heresy wars\\" besetting his times, Julian looked with longing at the domestic peace of paganism.  The empire might have contended with competitors or \\"barbarians\\", but its population remained peaceful over religious issues.  Kirsch shows how Julian developed a longing for those days of toleration in the midst of sectarian strife.<br /><br />At his accession to \\"the purple\\", Julian attempted the reverse of Akhenaton's career.  Instead of monotheism and \\"One True God\\", Julian attempted to restore the traditional deities and reduce the violence of Christian orthodox and \\"heretical\\" contenders.  It was a formidable task.  Kirsch notes that by the time of Juilan's accession there were over 150 sects professing to know \\"the truth\\".  Such absolutism was unlikely to lead to a reign of tolerance.  Julian's only hope was to show that paganism could restore peace, but the Christians were launched on an  all-or-nothing struggle for dominance.  Regrettably, Julian's restoration of rationality was cut short by a Persian spear in his liver.  Inevitably, Kirsch ponders what the history of Europe might have been if Julian had been granted the three decades allotted to Constantine by the Fates.  What Kirsch cannot do is more than hope that books such as his might someday lead to the restoration of reason.

All journalists seem to serve an apprenticeship [a penance?] on Manhattan Island.  Hay's career with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation finely honed her \\"people instincts\\"<br /><br />Hay has given us an episodic journey through a journalist's life.  The tour takes us to Mexico, Canada's far North and urban centres and, of course, New York City [nearly all journalists seem to serve an apprenticeship - penance?? - in NYC].  Hay's journey brings her in contact with various people, but it's her emotional links that become the focus in this book.  With women, there's a strange ambivalence.  She's clearly seeking friends, but keeping them requires something difficult for her to grasp.  Her relationship with men is worse.  She sheds a husband.  She acquires a lover, then a baby.  And loses a dog.  As well as a friend to AIDS.<br /><br />If these jerky sentences seem difficult, wait until you enter Elizabeth Hay's world.  Her mind skips from place to place and condition to condition.  Snow is an underlying theme, as is fur.  In Canada, of course, snow and fur have a tightly entwined relationship.  Winter is the best season for taking fur-bearing animals.  Hay relates stories from the headiest days of the fur trade.  The trade, of course, evolved from the intrusion of the European explorers.  Hay delves into the private lives of several - Champlain, Hearne, Thompson, Hall - revealing overlooked foibles [Champlain's wife was eleven years of age when they married].  These accounts show Hay at her best, but then she relapses into her own relationships.  The tie between these conditions are tenuous, at best.<br /><br />If you're looking for insights into the workings of a traveller's mind, this is a good start.

Peter Gardenfors must have been a keen Lego practitioner, however.  His thesis of how our primate ancestors developed the unique cognitive skills we possess reflects those childhood building techniques.  He has a great deal of imagination as shown in his ideas and the in the manner he presents them.  In this highly readable and innovative treatise, he proposes that our African ancestors developed a high level of self-awareness before other cognitive skills could follow.  From that condition, our thinking abilities burgeoned well past that of our primate cousins.  He utilises the Platonic dialog in a fresh manner to present his ideas.  Gardenfors produces an imaginary talking monkey - Egon - to present questions readers might have on the proposed scenarios.  Readers may judge the appropriateness of the technique for themselves.<br /><br />Most of his thesis resounds of commonly-accepted views.  The physical progression from Homo habilis to sapiens is established.  What is not is the development of cognitive skills.  How did the brain develop and what promoted its impetus?  Gardenfors' departure is in how the process unfolded.  Instead of building a few basic traits and skills, adding a bit to each over time, he suggests that various elements in our cognitive abilities emerged, developed into a mature state, then \\"rested\\".  Then another trait would follow the same path to achieve an equivalent level of functionality.  He starts with the physical, of course, touch sensation and perception of visual and auditory signals.  From these would arise such elements as emotions, memory and planning.  In turn, these advances build self-consciousness, \\"free will\\" and language, the ultimate achievement.<br /><br />Gardenfors tentatively proposes that the adding of each level of cognitive ability drove the brain to become the structure humans enjoy today.  The feedback loop is through hunting and meat consumption, which provides resources for an enlarging brain.  The enlarging brain demands more resources and advanced cognitive skills to obtain them.  Once the first steps beyond what our savannah-living ancestors ate and how they acquired food took place, the continuing reinforcement expanded our thinking abilities.  Gardenfors relies on Daniel C. Dennett's [\\"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\\"] four-step sequence of the evolution of awareness.  While the model is valid, it remains an open question whether Gardenfors' depiction of it as a segmented advancements is equally plausible.<br /><br />For humans today cognitive skills go beyond those of mere survival and mating tactics.  This step means incorporating a sense of intentionality on the part of others.  Are the goals we strive for related to those of someone else?  Are they in conflict?  Can that conflict be resolved and how do we accomplish that?  Gardenfors addresses these questions carefully, using \\"Egon the Talking Monkey\\" as his foil.  \\"Egon\\" stands in for the remainder of the animal kingdom, and Gardenfors is at pains to establish what he sees as an abyss between \\"us\\" and \\"them\\".  He's not denying our evolutionary roots, but notes that our cognitive skills represent a major departure from other primates - \\"apes don't ape\\" he declares.<br /><br /> This book is a good entry to the realm of cognitive studies, whether for the student considering the field or for someone with a general interest.  Gardenfors's technique of using a \\"talking monkey\\" may seem a bit bizarre at first glance, but it proves a useful means of bringing various commonly posed questions to light.  It also avoids having to crudely interpret or synopsise the views of others in the field.  The author's text is a fine balance between the academic and the superficial popular writing too often encountered.  Consciousness studies are a minefield of contrasting opinions.Gardenfors navigates the treacherous path skillfully, while presenting his own thinking.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]nions.

It doesn't seem like the sort of place for Christmas miracles.  But then Bethlehem wasn't a bustling burg, either.  Given the California December weather, the coastal community has developed a ritual to ward off mid-winter ennui - Lonesome Christmas.  Given the fluctuations in marriages and other relationships in the town, it's inevitable that \\"singles\\" will want some company for the holidays.  There are also some poor in the town, in the best Dickensian tradition.  Giving those people a nice tree for the holiday provides Moore's opening scene.<br /><br />Housing developer Dale Pearson is forced to plant a new pine tree for every one he removes to build a home.  An efficient man, Dale has plumped them all in one small plot.  That makes it easy to nick one at Christmastime.  Someone's been doing that and he sets out to catch the tree-napper in flagrante delicto.  When he does, he's wearing a Santa costume for a party.  He catches the tree thief, who turns out to be his ex-wife, but there's a scuffle and Dale is left with a spade stuck in his throat.  \\"Santa's\\" demise is witnessed by a child, whose  language skills are a high point of the book.  He's special in other ways, also.<br /><br />The body, however, disappears.  This confuses Theo Crowe, the law-enforcement agency in the town.  Everything about Dale's going missing perplexes Theo.  Many things perplex Theo, not the least of which is his wife, Molly.  A former B-movie star, she's the town's nut case.  Actually, that's unjust, since finding anyone truly sane in Pine Cove would be a fruitless quest.  However, Molly's been certified by the State, which as least gives her a legalist edge on the rest of its citizens.  Dale's disappearance is offset by the emergence of an angel, encountered in separate circumstances by both Theo and Molly.<br /><br />The angel, Raziel, is no stranger to Moore fans.  He's dealt with one child, although tardy by ten years.  Now, he's looking for another.  He wants to do his job properly this time.  The child turns out to be the murder witness, Josh.  Still unnerved by the sight of the throat-slashed gift-giver, Josh blurts out his dearest wish to the angel.  The angel, having not a shred of understanding of human affairs, proceeds to comply.  The resulting activities give Moore the opportunity to display his wit and style their fullest expression.  You never ask \\"why?\\" of a Moore story, nor yet a \\"how?\\".  You sit back and let him take you on a bumpy sleighride of improbable events, unlikely people and quirkily resolved scenarios.  Moore puts his characters through a hilarious sequence of events.  All in the name of Christmas spirit[s]!<br /><br />Raziel's portrayal displays Moore's poorly hidden scorn of the supernatural.  He crosses the line from purely humorous narrative to the mildly philosophical.  Raziel isn't truly stupid.  He simply has no way of understanding the human sphere.  How could he?  He works under a sense of logic Mr Spock would envy.  Moore's approach to the supernatural is novel and effective.  It forces reconsideration of the myths we hold.  With his animated prose and innovative ideas, he is treading new paths in fiction.  He may well be classed as the North American challenger to Britain's Terry Pratchett.  For this reviewer, no greater accolade can be offered.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]b properly this time.  The child turns out to be the murder witness, Josh.

444012:US	50941451	R3N34KX8P6PG5S	0393050831	70730083	Jacob's Ladder: The History of the Human Genome	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Makes a very long story short	Since the announcement of the coarse mapping of the human genome, the media have deluged us with promises of great advances.  Medicine, agriculture, psychology, even biotechnology, all seem to be potential beneficiaries of the the unravelling of \\"what makes us human\\".  Henry Gee, in presenting a sweeping background to these attractive promises, sounds a cautionary note.  How is it, he asks, that from the moment of conception a process is unleashed that produces a living child in a mere 200 days?  From the merging of two single cells, each carrying their share of the information that built you and i, what led to each of us being distinct individuals, yet bearing an inheritance reaching billions of years back in time?<br /><br />Although the event is common, with 150 human births occuring every minute, Gee explains that understanding of the process was long in coming.  From Aristotle, who thought babies came from menstrual blood to the Enlightenment, which accorded either eggs or sperm with possession of generations of nested individuals, there was a long, tortuous path to understanding conception.  Behind that understanding lay much investigation, theorisation and speculation.  Gee naturally positions Charles Darwin with a pivotal role in that understanding, but wants us to be aware of the host of other researchers and their contributions.  A major hurdle was the distinction between \\"external\\" births such as chicken eggs and the delivery method of dogs, horses and humans.<br /><br />Ironically, it was challenges to Darwin's great insight that led to major advances in genetics.  William Bateson sharply criticised Darwin's notion of \\"gradualism\\" in forming new species.  Bateson thought that gradual change should be visible in animal populations and went looking for them.  At the same time, another Darwin critic, Thomas Hunt Morgan, was examining thousands of fruit flies to learn how to identify what Bateson was seeking.  Morgan was probably the most reluctant Darwinian since Charles Lyell, but was finally won over by his labouring students who demonstrated how genes worked.<br /><br />The buildup of the genome over the vast history of life on Earth becomes Gee's next topic.  How did we get here and what's the present offer in the way of clues?  He uses Graham Cairns Smith notion that the first step in creating a genome likely began in the dense environment of clay crystals.  From this molecular origin, the author takes us to a menagerie of creatures, all of whom have something to contribute to the story.  We are introduced to the mycoplasma - today's simplest creatures with less than 500 genes.  Are they holdovers from an ancient form?  We learn that parasites of bacteria have forced the trimming of genomes as a protective strategy.  Why haven't we done the same, he asks, or are we in the process?  The larger genome of humans, he reminds us, isn't sufficient to explain either our complexity or our uniqueness.  Changes in our genome are traceable, with agriculture's introduction a major contributor.<br /><br />When the history of the study of the genome, whether fruit fly, bacterium or human, has been delineated, Gee takes the investigation a step further.  He notes the propensity of the media to tout \\"a gene for\\" any number of traits, physical or behavioural.  We must use the Internet as a model, he urges.  The networking of many computers serves as a template for the information management of the genome.  Genes, selfish as they may be in trying to reproduce, must cooperate in complex organisms.  Single steps to gain single goals is no longer feasible, if it ever was.  The intricate network of genome activity demands further attention.<br /><br />Like so many modern science writers, Gee chips away at Darwin iconology.  He wants to demonstrate that all those \\"wrong\\" thinkers of the past made contributions.  Unlike many iconoclasts, Gee keeps his critique muted, a welcome change.  He also challenges us with questions about where the knowledge of the genome is leading.  Knowledge of the  human genome has the potential to elevate us from apes to angels.  Are we prepared to face the issues that genome manipulation may generate?  If you read this book, you will understand his concern.  With the knowledge he provides, you will be more prepared.

With any book about the human mind, you have a right to expect information and clarification.  There's a great deal of information here, and it's presented with clarity.  However, while you will learn much from this book, at the end you will be aware of how much remains to be done.  That situation, as Blackmore explains, is due to the nature of the subject.  Not only are the issues of consciousness difficult to explain, but, a definition - the very foundation of discussion - is lacking.  With such a frail base, what can an author give the enquiring reader?  Blackmore summarises the advances made in attempting to define \\"consciousness\\".  Her approach, although formatted as a textbook, is accessible to anyone wishing to delve into studies of the mind.  She's to be applauded for synopsising a very dynamic topic with apparent ease.<br /><br />The study of consciousness is inevitably contentious.  With so little firm information available on the workings of the brain, theories of \\"how the mind works\\" abound.  Blackmore skilfully guides the reader through the many theories of mind that have emerged over many centuries.  Blackmore uses those theories to organise her presentation, describing a theorist and his/her idea as a discussion focus.  Inevitably, it is Descartes and \\"dualism\\" that provide the opening scenario.  The structure allows the author to post some \\"assignments\\" that may look like academic exercises, but are couched in terms any reader can understand and use.  After all, we all have ideas about what \\"consciousness\\" means.  Why should we not test our assumptions?  Blackmore helps us do this as each chapter offers another step in contrasting our own views with that of the philosophers.<br /><br />With over two millennia of thinkers on thinking, ideas proposed and overturned, it would seem this book might be a Rogue's Gallery of theories and theorists.  Blackmore is too even-handed to render summary judgements, especially condemnatory ones.  There are few heroes in this tale - with the exception of William James.  He's frequently lauded, not only for founding the science of psychology, but for the lengthy list of insights into the human mind he discerned.  Blackmore's tributes to James are low-key and not effusively laudatory.  But there are few chapters that aren't introduced by a Jamesian quotation.  James' successors, from Chalmers to Searle, address Cartesian dualism in various ways.  Dennett, the most scathing critic of the \\"Cartesian theatre\\" in which a virtual little \\"person\\" sits in our brain viewing the world, crops up repeatedly.  That's only right and proper, since many of those claiming to have dumped dualism, secretly harbour it.  The hints are often well camouflaged, but Blackmore shows how Dennett's discerning gaze penetrates any obscuring verbiage to triumphantly expose it to public scrutiny.<br /><br />As Blackmore guides us through most of the prevailing concepts of consciousness, she introduces some of the novelties that distort our perception of it.  Nearly half the book is composed of descriptions of things that mislead us.  Various dream states, and their impact on the body are presented.  The \\"phantom limb\\" syndrome, amnesia and perceptions of spirits and fairies all make their appearance.  Blackmore parades these anomalies before us, accompanied by explanations of their real nature - which runs from cryptic neurotransmitter behaviour to outright fraud.<br /><br />Although this book appears as a university text, and will likely be welcomed in many classrooms, its readership will not be confined to academic halls.  The mysteries of consciousness are of concern to us all.  That alone should lead to it being placed on countless shelves.  These are issues that continue to intrigue us.

At first glance, this seems a foolish question.  All creatures strive for survival.  None have ever been known to vote for extinction.  Alanna Mitchell, disturbed by what she has observed around the planet, still poses the question to the researchers she meets.  Will we soon go extinct through our own thoughtless activities?  Will we continue to denude forests of their trees?  Will we allow our auto exhausts to melt the polar ice fields?  How many other species will we drive into extinction before we follow?  These aren't new questions.  Nor does Mitchell pose them in any particularly unique way.  However, her personal anguish comes through vividly in this string of powerfully evocative essays.  As a \\"new learner\\" in observing ecological disaster, her concern is one we should all share.<br /><br />Mitchell is almost unique in her descriptives prowess as she tours the planet's ecological \\"hot spots\\".  She has discovered Charles Darwin, followed some of his travels and drunk deeply of the wisdom he imparted.  The Pierean spring, cautions the cliche, scorns the shallow questor, and Mitchell has followed that dictum.  In some haste, she turns to those on the sites for further information.  They don't fail her as she watches attempts to restore trees in Madagascar, where only ten percent of the original stands survive.  She learns that ancient cultures aren't easily cast aside - the Malagasy think the trees will go on forever.  They spend more time and energy following the shrinking forest without considering the possibility that the trees may not be there someday.  A familiar outlook, reflecting the energy use in our own society, she reminds us.<br /><br />Her study of Darwin leads her to compare his ordeal in bringing natural selection to a skeptical Victorian England to today's outlook about nature's resources.  Where the Victorians believed life couldn't change, our society views the Earth's assets  as infinite - \\"it will always be there\\".  Mitchell contests this fallacy with vigour, as she visits sites displaying contrary evidence.  Darwin explained how everything undergoes constant change.  She uses an ancient example to express her warning.  Returning to Canada, paleontologist Phil Currie takes her into the Alberta Badlands to refute the popular notion that an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs.  'Where are the fossils that should be near the impact time?' is his rhetorical question.  His answer is that the dinosaurs, life's most successful lifeform, were lost due to climate change.  If they couldn't survive, Mitchell contends, can we?<br /><br />Further north, she sees the effect of climate change in Canada's Arctic.  Climate experts know the warming atmosphere will have earlier and more drastic impact here.  Already the effect is showing in mild winters, earlier Spring and diminished hunting.  The story is repeated endlessly - humans have soiled their nest with overcutting of trees, pumping too much water from limited acquifers, and emissions of gases choking the atmosphere we must all share.  It's a bleak picture, with a label tacked on: \\"Fix this now!\\"<br /><br />Some \\"fixing\\" is under way.  In South America, a consortium struggles to convert sacred sites into eco-tourist meccas.  Remote tribes can entertain visitors, earning income while protecting their homelands from the chainsaw.  In Iceland, where the world is splitting open, geothermal power is a major replacement for oil heating.  Transportation may replace petrol in vehicles travelling the limited distances of the island with the most common fuel type in the universe - hydrogen.  Back in Canada, Mitchell rejoices over a strange alliance.  A major logging firm and environmentalists have agreed to terms protecting the boreal forest.  Certainly a liasion unthinkable a short time ago, but one giving strong promise of real progress in sustainability.<br /><br />Of the many works on our environmental crises now available, Mitchell's is one offering the most dramatic examples, while holding out the best promise for the future.  Her penetrating observations and personalised style place her in a special relationship with us as readers.  While she recounts the larger scientific questions, she's also able to show how environmental issues are daily fare for many.

Recently, that ability has been stretched by writers who describe the \\"abnormal\\".  The young, autistic Christopher in \\"Curious Incident\\" is the prime example.  Frances Itani takes us into a different world, that of the deaf.  It's a world of endless confusion.  There are sounds, so easy to the hearing, but meaningless to the deaf.  We think speech is the only important sound, but talk is hurried, undirected, and indistinct.  Nature produces her own sounds which we use in speech, but for which there's no meaning to the deaf.  Through Grania O'Brien's early life, Itani strives to introduce us to that world.  Does she succeed?<br /><br />Grania, who would have been \\"Grainne\\" in her ancestral Ireland, lives in small-town Ontario as the story opens.  Deafened by scarlet fever [remember that?], she's coached by Mamo, her grandmother.  Blessed with a quick eye for lip-reading, Grania is given a book with words displayed as rope.  The rope, of course, becomes highly symbolic as the book progresses, but Grania begins to equate the shapes with meaning.  Mamo strains to have the girl equate printed words with proper sounds.  It's important that Grania \\"blend in\\" with the rest of the community.  With her parents running a hotel, Grania's only other tie is with her sister Tress, with whom she develops a secret sign language.<br /><br />All of Mamo's dedicated effort, nor trips to sacred shrines, can't force the pace.  Grania is to leave home for a \\"Deaf School\\".  Itani portrays the school as staffed with immensely caring ladies.  No Dickens intrudes with harsh discipline or abuse, but the school draws children from across the Province.  All the children remain in school until the summer holidays.  Sign language is discouraged for those who can speak - dividing the children, some of whom are mute.  Itani passes rapidly over Grania's progress in the school.  The deaf girl, however, manages to shed some of her fear of the dark - a long-held terror.<br /><br />Meeting a young aide in a hospital after leaving the school, Grania's life takes a new turn.  The courtship is but a moment in the story - the wedding description not even related until much later in the book.  Instead, the Kaiser rudely intrudes on their lives with the invasion of Belgium.  Itani carefully rejects any political discussion in the narrative.  King and Country [Britain, not Canada] are under threat and Jim must sign up.  There's no family discussion, no question of how Irish immigrants in a far land should react - Jim crosses the Atlantic.  There's a training stint, then Jim finds himself in the thick of battle.  When time and circumstances permit, letters are scribbled in muddy trenches.  Sometimes Grania's reach Jim, but delays in the exchanges make communication a flimsy thread.<br /><br />Itani makes a splendid effort to depict the impact of the Great War.  Confronted as we are today by daily images of conflict, Itani still manages to impart a special sense of horror at events.  The years pass with Jim, a stretcher-bearer, braving the bombardments and fusillades of machine-gun fire, without being able to fight back.  He carries wounded, tends their injuries, dodges fire and grows increasingly introspective.  Never once, does he question the worth of the conflict.  At home in Desoronto, Grania watches the causality lists, the statistics of insanity, lengthen while she worries.  Soldier's wives need more visibility and Itani's effort is commendable.<br /><br />This book cries out for a sequel.  Grania's life hardly ends with the Armistice.  With the end of the War, her deafness remains, the family is almost intact and a future must unroll.  Itani has built a unique scenario with skillful prose.  You will not find it easy to put this book down as you read.  However, when you do finish, you will find the conclusion abrupt.  Nothing is lost by that finale, but there might be much gained by goingon.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]da]	2004-11-17

Once considered a \\"degenerate\\" form of life, parasites are being seen as important  indicators of how evolution has progressed over 4 billion years.  Zimmer credits them with being the driving force for biological diversity.  He substantiates this claim with a sweeping, evocative survey of what is known today about parasites.  That, he regretfully concedes, is little enough.  What is known is that many early conceptions about parasites needed to be thrown aside as more information about this highly adaptable and widely variable range of organisms emerges.<br /><br />While we may recoil at the term \\"parasite\\", Zimmer identifies but one villain in this book.  Ray Lankester, a devoted Edwardian-era evolutionist, postulated that parasites were a \\"regressive\\" form of organism.  He thought they shed evolutionary advantages as they simplified their bodies through their life cycles.  Lankester thus set the tone for generations - biologists avoided studying parasites as offering no additional information revealing evolution's processes.  Zimmer explains that since parasites are predators, it was thought they ought to follow the patterns of other predators - stalking prey like lions, or following scent gradients like sharks.<br /><br />Instead, as more about them came to light, it was revealed how adaptive parasites are.  Some, in fact, have developed the talent of making \\"prey\\" come to them.  One fluke invades a snail early in its career.  In an intermediate, but distinctive form, it then moves to an ant.  Residing in the ant's brain, at some point it directs the ant to climb a grass stalk.  There it waits for the grass, along with the ant and itself, to be eaten by a cow.  The fluke cruises through the cow's stomach before taking up residence in the liver as adults, yet another body form.  When the eggs are produced, they return to the intestinal tract to be later deposited on the ground, awaited by the snails.  Looking at each phase, residing in a different host, you would be inclined to see it as a separate species.<br /><br />This note is but one of the endless chorus of parasite adaptations Zimmer relates in this excellent book.  He joins the refrain of older scientists lamenting the lack of upcoming researchers needed in parasite studies.  Unlike the animals we see around us, most parasites have astonishingly varied body forms as they go through the phases of their life cycles.  For years, this catalog of body plans was thought to display different species.  Only recently has it been demonstrated that these creatures changed shape and function dramatically as they changed living environments.  Identifying each stage, the invader's function there, the impact on the host and other elements requires long, patient and dedicated work.<br /><br />Those of us in the urban world think we can keep parasites at a distance, flooding our farms and wetlands with chemicals to fend them off.  This is false confidence, Zimmer reminds us.  Parasites are the most adaptable forms of life on the planet.  They are as likely to promote change as respond to it.  Zimmer cites Robin Dunbar's thesis that grooming for parasites ultimately allowed humans to develop speech and language.  He explains how our immune systems and parasites enter a modus vivendi that allows the parasite and host alike to survive.  Recognising how that process evolved could lead to better coexistence through \\"taming\\" the invaders.<br /><br />Coexistence with these minute creatures turns out to have many implications.  It's now clear that the development of agriculture made human society vulnerable to invaders unknown on the savannah.  Human bodies became less robust and mortality rates rose.  How far back in time have they had influences on us and what are those?  Zimmer suggests that some monkeys have developed \\"manners\\" in resource or mate competition.  They scream and cavort, but don't scratch or bite rivals for fear of bloodworm infection.  Others use particular leaves to clear digestive tracts of infestations.  We hear of researchers seeking \\"genes for\\" schizophrenia, homosexuality, even \\"gods\\".  Zimmer thinks we're looking in the wrong place.  Instead, he urges, we should identify the \\"flukes for\\" these and other aspects of human behaviour and form.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]leaves to clear digestive tracts of infestations.

Books	5	5	5	N	N	Techno-man terminates terrestrials	Once characterised as the \\"tool-making\\" ape, human beings have shown an astounding propensity for technology.  We unconsciously deal with technology every day, thinking we know its definition.  We communicate instantly, pay debts electronically, and even post book reviews that millions can read.  Jonathan Kingdon takes a deeper view of \\"technology\\".  He considers it differently, suggesting \\"stones\\", \\"spears\\" and \\"fire\\" are more meaningful in our heritage than is electronics.  It has, he contends, allowed our species to spread across the globe into every habitable niche.  It also allows us to engage in a level of destructiveness unmatched by any other creature.  The evolutionary roots of this behaviour are thoughtfully explained and rendered in this excellent study.<br /><br />According to Kingdon, our use of technology helped drive our own evolution in ways Darwin never envisioned.  The use of spears helped spur our exodus out of Africa in search of new food prey.  Walking upright made the task increasingly easy.  Shattered stones, shaped for precise use, became food processors - devices no leopard had at its disposal.  Our prominent canine teeth, no longer needed, were reduced in size.  Fire, that fearsome affair on savannah or woodland, was tamed to provide foods more easily and effectively digested.  Our stomachs declined in size while the added proteins enhanced our brain.  Fire also likely shaped our early social arrangements, bringing together the foundations of the kind of groups we're familiar with today.<br /><br />Physical attributes responded to changes in habitat, diet and environment.  The human face, drastically changed from its earlier primate visage.  The human skull, once thickly ridged in our precursors, developed thinner bones, allowing changes in eye movement, extended our nose even as the capacity to detect smells declined.  Our noses are more likely the result of needing to take in more air while moving or respiring in hot climates.  Less chewing of food reduced the need for heavy jaw muscles, giving the brow more flexibility.  Our expanding brains thus found room to grow.  You can watch the process with every newborn child.  Food - its finding, gathering and processing - is the pivot for much of our development.<br /><br />Kingdon shows how the quest for food led to our emigration along traceable paths - riverine valleys, forested shorelines and wooded [but not forested] areas.  The route of migration out of Africa followed a \\"Southern Route\\" along Arabia, India and into Southeast Asia.  The recent find of Homo floresienses shows how diverse that movement could make us.  We learned to follow animal tracks to water where prey resided, which also improved our bipedal capability.  Extended range became increasingly the norm, but while it was once to our advantage, in today's world it foreshadows disaster.<br /><br />The earliest indication what the future would bring was the Australia-Pacific region.  It's only become known in recent years that the Island Continent was once home to many species of large fauna.  Three-metre tall kangaroos, huge wombat-like browsers and killer birds once roamed Australia.  Within a few millennia these all disappeared - shortly after our relatives crossed there from Asia.  Similar extinctions occurred in the Western Hemisphere with similar timing.  Over three-quarters of large mammals disappeared after humans entered North and South America.  \\"Contrary to the sentimental image of a life in harmony with nature\\", Kingdon says, humans exploited fully whatever resources they encountered.<br /><br />Old, genetically ingrained habits, he reminds us, die hard.  We are still approaching our surroundings as if there was plenty to go around.  If we deplete it, we retain the notion that there's somewhere else to go.  And, having filled the planet, it's clear there's nowhere else to go.  Kingdon discounts the optimists who think the \\"Green Revolution\\" is a solution to our rising population's food needs.  He cites Japan, a nation struggling for self-sufficiency in rice by applying the best technology available, has likely \\"reached the limits of what rice can produce\\".  Clearly, he urges, it is time to understand our past and seek more realistic strategies for the future.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]g population's food needs.

It's our good fortune that Thomas Eisner ignores that counsel.  Not only does he disdain it, he turns it on its head.  He probes, he directs, he examines and he dissects.  When he's done, he sits down to convey to us what he's found.  Between what he's learned and how he explains it to us, we are the richer for his refuting the old admonition.  Mother Nature, while exposed in this book, is hardly violated.  Instead, she parades her wonders before us, dazzling us with the powers of her miniscule offspring.  In a book about little beasts, Eisner has triumphed in adding a new dimension to the world we inhabit.<br /><br />Eisner was one of those lucky children whose parents didn't rein him in.  As refugees, they settled in Uruguay where young Thomas was able to wander in fields and jungles.  He developed an affinity for insects, particularly beetles.  Haldane's quip, \\"an inordinant fondness for beetles\\" is entirely apt.  Early in his academic career in the US, he and E.O. Wilson made a \\"bug collecting tour\\" around the \\"Lower 48\\".  Who better to partner with in such a quest?  From those early explorations, Eisner has been often in the field, observing, collecting, testing.  Although many of the insects resented his presence, they continued to perform for him.<br /><br />The performance is a symphony of chemicals.  Many insects display riotous colour schemes.  This would seem suicidal in a world where birds, unlike mammal predators, have good chromatic vision.  Yet most of the insect clowns pass through life unmolested.  Eisner explains that many insects are walking chem labs.  Various chemicals reside in glands - chemicals that send birds tumbling, toads vigorously spitting out prey, or sending other insects packing.  These chemicals may be oozed from small pores, issue as droplets or, in the more explosive cases, shot with inerring accuracy at a tormentor.  If you pinch one on a particular spot, the beetle will deluge your fingers with a burning liquid.  Darwin learned the power of these chemicals in while collecting.  Innocently putting one in his mouth while trying to collect a new specimen, he spat it out instantly, losing the lot.<br /><br />These compounds are not just something that tastes or smell bad.  In some cases they are virulent toxins.  Cyanide isn't something you'd carry around in your pocket, but the XXX beetle knows how to send a spray of it from its body.  Others disperse steroids that can be heart-stoppers.  And the heart stopped could be yours.  Usually, however, the victims are inattentive predators or innovative ones.  Today's travel levels and the trade in pet species from distant lands, bring together creatures unadapted to one another.  Pet lizards fed on local insects have no idea of their lethal capabilities.  Today's $50 pet may be stretched out in its cage only moments after ingesting something as common as a \\"firefly\\".<br /><br />Eisner's coverage of insect novelty is immensely knowledgeable.  He explains what he observed, what experiments he tried with his creatures and the results, and what it all means in evolutionary terms and for life in general.  It's an immense project, yet his personalised account keeps you wondering what will come next.  He's an evocative writer on what might be an arcane subject.  His enthusiasm is infective and it's aided by the stunning photographs that visualise the text.  Whatever you may have thought about insects before reading this, you will come away with a whole new outlook.  Just remember to be cautious about putting one in your mouth.

"	Centuries of copying, moving, editing and tinkering have caused monotheism's \\"holy book\\" to viewed with some doubt.  The \\"Hebrew Bible\\", or Torah, transmogrified into the \\"Old Testament\\" by Christianity, is the fundamental origin of the faith of millions.  Once thought to be authored by Moses, who would have had to pen much of it after his death, scholarship finally concluded that The Book was the work of many authors.  Friedman has done an<br /><br />outstanding job of sorting out who [at least in the abstract] produced the texts accumulated into what was known as The Books of Moses.  A proponent of the Documentary Hypothesis, he has lined out with vivid clarity which author created which text of The Book.<br /><br />In his Introduction, Friedman insists that whatever interpretation of authorship is to be followed, it must be based on evidence.  This challenges the idea that \\"faith\\" is sufficient support for how the authorship of this anthology should be viewed.  Empirical evidence, he argues, is the only solid basis to consider in assessing origins.  To perform this feat, he has accumulated \\"the largest collection of evidence ever assembled\\".  He then presents the source texts to demonstrate their artistry, their notions of the divine, the history of their nation and how they view humanity.  The books, he notes, were assembled from sources as any historical rendering should be done.<br /><br />He identifies the authors by letter designations, mostly arbitrary, but clearly distinct.  Each author has an identifiable reference in time and place.  The first two, \\"J\\" and \\"E\\", and their editor [\\"redactor\\"] \\"RJE\\" are scribes from the 8th and 9th centuries BCE.  \\"J\\" is a resident of the southern kingdom of Judah, while \\"E\\" is an Israelite priest in the north.  Their use of the name of the deity, Yahweh or Elohim respectively, is the major clue to the author.  Using these sources, the \\"RJE\\" editor compiled their work after the Assyrian conquest of Israel.  A third author, \\"P\\" follows, probably in the 6th or 5th century, who added much on the law and stories of creation, exile and captivities.  The final author, \\"D\\" composed the book of Deuteronomy, which assembled the \\"J\\" and \\"E\\" sources and covered the last acts of Moses.<br /><br />Friedman lists seven methods of analysis he used in compiling and evaluating the material to determine authorship.  These are: Linguistic, which reflects the variations of Hebrew over the centuries; Terminology, the use of words and phrases by the various authors; Content, which includes the names of the deity and various sacred objects; Continuity, in which the \\"narrative flow\\" is revealed by separating the texts and re-reading them for stylistic indicators; Connections, parallels in or between various Books; Relationships, placing the texts in historical context; and Convergence, showing how different lines of evidence come together.  It was clearly a monumental task Friedman has undertaken and achieved.<br /><br />In presenting this mass of material in understandable form, Friedman has put the publisher to an immense task.  Verse by the various authors are presented in varying fonts and colours in direct contrast to each other.  A key to the sources is presented, which the reader would do well to review closely.  It's the expression of Friedman's analytical prowess and dedicated scholarship.  This book, as a reference, is hardly light reading, nor is it intended to be.  It demonstrates fully the human basis of the collection.  Authors draw on one another for material, then restate it in their own terms, or create new text where they feel omissions require explanation.  Friedman dodges the question of \\"divine inspiration\\" adroitly, but it's clear The Book, revered by so many, is work of men's hands.

One aspect of Terry Pratchett's genius as a writer is innovation.  Lately, he's turned away from what might have become a rut - for both reader and writer - to launch a string of stand-alone books.  We've had the introduction of a newspaper to Ankh-Morpork, a man falling through time to encounter himself, and an army of females [\\"women\\" would hardly be appropriate, here].  With this book, yet another declaration of independence has been issued.  It's still the Discworld.  A few known characters flit through cameo appearances - even if only virtually or even silently.  One new persona emerges who will capture your attention, your sympathy, and, if you're not careful, your wallet.<br /><br />If Moist van Lipwig has a personal Hell, its label is \\"Honesty\\".  He's a confidence trickster, but we mustn't judge him too harshly for that.  It's a career that any \\"businessperson\\" will identify with.  Good Things are: a growing economy, minimal government interference while providing essential services and avoiding violence.  Bad Things are: officials poking into private affairs, low profits and a soiled public image.  Moist takes advantage of the Good Things while simply avoiding the Bad.  He's been on the run for years, even while accumulating a stash of ill-gotten gains.  A means of avoiding capture is being someone else.  As this book opens one of his persona is facing hanging - which takes place.<br /><br />Yet it wasn't Moist that died, but one of his aliases - Albert Spangler.  With Spangler gone, it would seem Moist has a clear path to elsewhere to make a new start.  Unfortunately for Moist, Ankh-Morpork's Patrician, Lord Vetinari, has other plans for him.  Part of the scenario includes Moist being employed by Vetinari.  Not only must he assume the mantle of honesty, he's now a Civil Servant!  The job is the restoration of the defunct Ankh-Morpork Post Office.<br /><br />The PO's laggardly pace has been outstripped by a new technology - a form of semaphore known as the \\"clacks\\".  Owned and operated by the Grand Trunk corporation, the firm incorporates the philosophy of Good and Bad Things listed above.  As we all know, or are often told, \\"downsizing\\" means \\"efficiency\\".  The businessman's mind equates \\"Overhead\\" with \\"Profit Loss\\" and there is no worse sacrilege found in the balance sheet.  \\"Overhead\\" includes \\"maintenance\\", which becomes the key to this story.  How many have died or been damaged due to faulty views of how much must be spent on \\"Overhead\\"?  How important is \\"Overhead\\"?  Is it important at all.<br /><br />Pratchett's genius goes beyond innovative thinking.  He has penetrated the financier's mind and practices, exposing them to public view and assessment.  This, he shows us, is a necessary and ongoing task.  He further exhibits that there is but only one social force capable of the task - an enlightened government with the power to enforce.  It takes a government interested in the public good, which remains an elusive goal.  This is hardly the stuff usually found in \\"fantasy\\", but that label's never been appropriate for Pratchett's work in any case.  Read this for entertainment first, returning to see how adroitly Pratchett has mirrored, once again, the world around us.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]as the \\"clacks\\".

Sam Harris thinks so, and is emphatic that we need to recognise that.  He doesn't like religion - there are too many illogical and inconsistent expressions of it.  He's particularly concerned about how religions manifest themselves in politics.  In this challenging and provocative book, he urges us all to be aware about what the \\"faithful\\" learn about their gods, and how they express that learning.  He finds the situation dangerous, threatening enough that immediate action is overdue to correct the peril we face.  This cry of alarm must be heeded, and Harris has done a thorough job of explaining why we must act.<br /><br />In the West, he notes how religious tolerance, after a long struggle to gain acceptance, poses a conundrum.  Tolerance means acceptance, but the faithful in the three extensive monotheistic religions, preclude tolerance.  \\"The Book\\", accepted if not admired universally, demands the diminution, if not the destruction of \\"heresy\\".  He's particularly scathing of Islam's own \\"Book\\", the Qur'an in its insistence on rooting out infidels.  Thus, there is no \\"border\\" to the Islamic world short of the planet itself.  This, he argues, is a tangible threat.  We've experienced one of its most diabolically conceived acts in the destruction of the Twin Towers.  This, he argues, is but the first of a series of acts that will grow increasingly severe with the passage of time.  Those in the West stressing that the suicide bombers are \\"fanatics\\" and \\"fundamentalists\\" are deluding themselves.  It is clear, Harris says, that Islam \\"must find a way to revise itself\\".<br /><br />Harris recapitulates the history of the Christian churches, with their extensive campaigns of expunging their own heretics and the Jews.  With both religions driven by divine commands, as expressed in the \\"Books\\", the gods insist on obedience by all people.  Those \\"chosen\\" to carry out that dictation are, of course, the faithful.  Those insisting on \\"tolerance\\" are reading the \\"Books\\" selectively.  To Harris, this is a shortsighted approach.  Others see The Books as divine ordinances that must be obeyed.  Christianity's long, bloody record is vividly presented, from the Inquisition through baptising Indian children before immediately executing them, the hunting of witches and other obscenities.  Nazism, often portrayed as the mindless expression of a few adherents, Harris argues, is simply another form of mainstream religion.  It certainly had the tacit approval of the Papacy.  The injunction to \\"purify\\" is still with us in many guises - even if only at the level of banning \\"Harry Potter\\" as endorsing witchcraft and wizardry, expressly condemned in Christianity's \\"Book\\".  Our enemy, Harris notes, is faith itself.<br /><br />As a neuroscientist, Harris arrives at an unexpected solution to the ills of a religious societies.  To Harris, the bizarre logic of Christianity - you can mutter a few words over your favourite Burgundy to render it into \\"Christ's blood\\" - must be shelved.  So, too, must be the religion that claims to be the \\"chosen\\" of a desert deity.  One that can condemn a man to death for writing fiction is morbidly irrational.  Since all these concepts are but symptoms of \\"normal people embracing madness as something holy\\" a fresh means must be found.  He's studied the various ideas of consciousness and discovered our notion of it can be abandoned.  Harris argues that the Eastern mystics provide the solution.  By abandoning the old faiths and learning the lessons mystics have acquired, the need for eliminating other humans for their derelictions of faith would evaporate.  Although a rational recommendation, it remains difficult to envision how such transformation would be effected.  The current technique of using \\"smart bombs\\" and imposed cultures is clearly inadequate, not to say unreasonable.<br /><br />Harris's book is a must read for everyone.  How else could the issues be confronted?  His history is sweeping, if necessarily brief.  His denunciation of religions is fully justified for their past and present practices, let alone the flawed foundations on which they rest.  What is needed is a campaign strategy - the only shortcoming this book exhibits.  Read it and make one of your own.

Dinosaur books, movies and other media has maintained the view of human evolution as something \\"set apart\\" from the remainder of the animal kingdom.  With this history he sweeps away much of that obscuring mist.  His focus is on paintings in Yale University's Peabody Museum - the \\"Sistine Chapel of evolution\\".  This striking comparison refers to Rudolph Zallinger's Age of Reptiles and Age of Mammals murals vividly illustrating the issues involved in tracing evolution's long course.  Weaving the story behind the paintings with the revelations of fossil hunters over the years, he adds some appropriate observations of his own.  The combination proves apt in this account of clashes of personalities and changes of outlook as more information comes into view over the decades.<br /><br />There is a thread linking the elements of Wallace's narrative - horses.  He explains how horses have two attributes typifying the questions arising from the study of ancient mammals - teeth and feet.  Tooth structure is a significant sign of the animal's diet, hence the likely environment in which it lived.  Browsers mean forests, which likely mean warm, humid conditions.  Grazers mean grasslands and cooler, arid conditions.  Multi-toed feet, typical in the small, early equine species indicate slower movement and a plodding pace suitable to forests.  Fewer toes and lighter legs mean speed in open spaces.  Fossils signalling various \\"horse\\" ancestors appeared in many places in the late 19th Century.  Wallace notes how the sequencing of these fossils supported Darwin's concept.  It also led to a serious debate over whether evolution had a \\"purpose\\".<br /><br />Darwin's insight led to many debates, but the one over \\"purpose\\" is only now declining quietly.  \\"Orthogenesis\\" contends that today's forms are the result of Nature's \\"experiments\\" leading to modern \\"perfect\\" versions.  To humans, the issue is significant in that Nature used all those millennia tinkering with life to ultimately produce us.  Wallace introduces us to many paleontologists and their theories of life.  In his account, orthogenesis remains a prevalent sub-theme for many years.<br /><br />Wallace recapitulates the \\"bone wars\\" of 19th Century Britain and America, with O.C. Marsh and E.D. Cope bringing ancient life to the public eye.  Their verbal brawls and race to find and name new species became an entertainment spectacle.  Although they concentrated on dinosaurs, digging doesn't always produce what you're expecting.  Mammal fossils, even if not viewed as important as the great reptiles, continued to emerge.  One find, as Wallace explains, was made in Patagonia in the last years of the 19th Century.  The fossil showed how mammals flourished in the \\"Age of the Dinosaurs\\" and forced re-thinking of mammalian evolution.  Later revelations put \\"orthogenesis\\" on shaky ground as the species tree grew bushier.  A linear path from early mammals to humans appeared less likely.<br /><br />It was horses again, and the giant of American paleontology, George Gaylord Simpson, that drove the final nail in the coffin of orthogenesis.  Dinosaurs had led some to link size with success.  Simpson demonstrated otherwise.  Adaptability, he argued, was far more significant an element.  He showed in detailed analysis that the various horse species were not in linear progression.  Many side branches show adaptation to new environments.  The same outlook took many years to be applied to the evolution of humans.  Wallace describes the struggle over identifying anthropoid and other primates that might have led to humans.  His depiction inevitably leads him to reflect on Stephen Gould and Niles Eldredge's idea of \\"punctuated equilibrium\\", which purported to challenge \\"neo-Darwinism\\" and finds it inapplicable in mammalian evolution.<br /><br />By using Zallinger's paintings as a pivot, Wallace has produced a book both compelling and informative.  His style keeps your interest, as does his introduction to the individuals making history in explaining prehistory.  Many were obscure before this book and some need further exposure.  Anyone visiting the Peabody Museum would do well to have this book as a guide to Zallinger's work.  Anybody reading this will not speed past the murals as irrelevant.

Paraphrasing Newton's famous disclaimer, however, Richard Dawkins seems to stand on the shoulders of the rest.  This collection of essays rebutting the miasma of Romantic Era complaints about science is more timely now than when first published.  The myth that science curtails - instead of enlarging - our sense of wonder, still persists.  A Keats' poem, the inspiration of this title, typifies not only the world of poetry and prose writing, but also our dominant religions, our educational curricula and even, as he points out devastatingly, our favourite entertainments.  Dawkins, in this superbly crafted collection of essays, refutes the Romantics and their legacy.  He ably demonstrates how science enhances our knowledge, our values and our sense of being.<br /><br />Dawkins cites Thomas Huxley's [\\"Darwin's Bulldog\\"] assessment of science as \\"organised common sense\\" as but a first step in explaining what science reveals.  Expanding on Huxley, the American Lewis Wolpert, argues that Nature is full of surprises and paradoxes.  A glass of water may contain a molecule of Shakespeare's last cup of tea.  Our credulity at seemingly inexplicable coincidences, our \\"gasps of awe\\" at the tricks \\"psychics\\" and other charlatans play on us, and our adherence to the teachings of \\"mystics\\" and other mountebanks may lie in the habits developed when we lived on the savannah.  Dawkins urges us to recognise that science, unlike religion or quack medicine, does not aim to deceive us.  Quite the reverse.  Science, in stripping away mythologies, reveals new forms of stunning beauty.<br /><br />It may seem paradoxical that Nature's wonders can be explained through barcodes, but Dawkins manages it with his usual panache.  In this case, he demonstrates how the familiar stripes on commercial products have natural equivalents.  \\"Barcodes in the Stars\\" are the analytical tools known as Fraunhofer lines which impart so much information about those distant nuclear furnaces.  Many experiments we cannot stage on this planet are taking place within distant stellar globes.  The forces, temperatures and atomic reactions exceed anything we can duplicate, but the \\"barcodes\\" are precise records of these events.  These \\"barcodes\\" are the result of Newton's early discovery of sunshine being \\"unwoven\\" into a spectrum.  We've also learned how the elements making up our bodies come from those pinpricks in the darkness.<br /><br />Part of Dawkins' role as a conveyor of \\"Public Understanding of Science\\" is the contending with mis-applications and abuses of science.  Dawkins has long campaigned against the \\"hijacking\\" of science to confuse and distract the public from what science really does.  He's firmly set against the notion that \\"science destroys beauty\\", but he's equally adamant against \\"bad poetry of science\\".  He's rightfully scornful of Teilhard de Chardin's fumbling mysticism of early in the last century.  Anyone thinking the Jesuit's approach is \\"ancient history\\" need only glance at some of the recent submissions on these pages.  A more advanced, if less innocuous thesis, according to Dawkins, is the transmutation of James Lovelock's Gaia concept by \\"New Age\\" advocates.  Dawkins concedes the Gaia concept is appealing in that it grants all life validity.  Destruction of habitats and ecosystems is appallingly wasteful.  However, he argues, until we abandon \\"wishy-washy\\" views of how species interact, we will never approach the solutions to our exterminations of life realistically.<br /><br />There are solid reasons for advocating this as the best of Dawkins' efforts.  He addresses many issues of deep concern to us all.  Is there a solution to the destruction of the environment by our species?  How does life truly operate and must we all tramp back to university to learn its arcane mechanisms?  What do we truly know about our world and the universe it occupies? More important to many, will learning what makes up the rainbow remove our feeling of its beauty?  While it's tempting to answer those questions here, it's far better for you to pick up this book and derive the answers yourself.  You won't be disappointed by what you read.

Philander is able to mix scientific and artistic elements with fluid elegance.  He observes that recent intense El Nino events have led to a new awareness on this phenomenon.  The focus, however, is both too limited and has been distorted by media.  People have been led to believe that the sudden warming of waters off the Peruvian coast is an abnormal phenomenon.  He points out that the El Nino and its obverse, La Nina are manifestations of a long-term oscillatory pattern.  Neither are \\"deviations\\" from some perceived norm.<br /><br />In explaining the Southern Oscillation of shifting warm and cool waters in the Eastern Pacific, Philander turns to various art expressions.  Weather predicting is often the butt of jocularity - we remember incorrect forecasts readily, blithely ignoring the recent advances in accuracy.  He recognises this tendency, but reminds us that our growing population, illogical placement of urban centres and vested economic need to have good science applied to anticipating weather trends and events.  Weather prediction, rarely, if ever, considered a \\"hard science\\" has made tremendous strides.  The tricks nature can play on us means that we must extend our thinking beyond solid mathematics.  We must utilise the techniques of the painter, the poet and even the musician in considering weather and climate.<br /><br />Forecasting the weather had flimsy beginnings.  A thoughtful observer in one location might make accurate records.  If nobody in neighbouring regions matched the work, it proved of little worth.  The telegraph immeasurably added to the creation of communication links, as did the reports of ship captains bringing observations from long voyages.  It was the integration of these bits of information through the intuitive methods of music or art that began to force new, expanded views of weather conditions.  The local scene was too limited to provide a complete picture.  Philander uses a musical metaphor to compare the weather in the British Isles with the California coast - a high-pitched violin or flute as contrasted with the notes of a cello or bassoon.  Conditions in other areas, he says, push aside single instruments, stating \\"only a huge symphony orchestra can do justice to the music of this planet\\".<br /><br />Predictability, common in most \\"hard\\" sciences, must give way to the many forces that contribute to our weather.  From the deep, cold currents moving at the sea bottom to the cycles of heat exchange in the atmosphere, subtle change can evoke monstrous events.  Such occurrences are more common along our inhabited coastal areas, but may reach far inland.  A long-standing sequence of disastrous famines in India led to one of the first investigations of just how the monsoon was generated.  Although the first attempts to understand it failed, it led to better assessments of the roots of weather patterns.  Many of these, including the monsoon, still defy full description.  Philander urges more investigation, although he recognises that those providing funding are still looking for quick, decisive answers.  These won't be easily forthcoming, he notes, but increased effort must be made.<br /><br />Philander has been a major voice in helping us to understand the vagaries weather investigators must endure.  He wants us to recognise that cyclical events like El Nino and its counterpart will continue.  We must be aware that hard and fast predictions are unlikely, and that we must prepare long-term plans to cope with changes.

The roots of game theory in biology go back several decades.  Roger Fisher's studies in the 1930s are generally credited with initiating the concept.  Later, Robert Axelrod and others expanded the idea with structured game applications.  The most famous of these is the Prisoner's Dilemma, where two charged thieves are offered \\"deals\\" by authorities.  Prisoner's Dilemma is easily played by any two people with a moderator.  The point of the game is to reconcile the issues of \\"defection\\" and \\"cooperation\\" with various \\"payoffs\\".  As Barash shows, the game is played often, usually unconsciously, by many people under varying conditions.  It is an underlying theme in many international situations.  Barash here introduces us to the basics of game theory, with many illustrative examples in human and other animal behaviour.<br /><br />From simple game propositions, Barash goes on to explain the many variations and how to assess them.  Instead of mathematical equations, which he eschews in the opening chapter, Barash provides matrix box sets with players, options and outcome results for each game set.  He then explains the logic of strategy variations for a single game encounter.  He points out that single encounters may neither validate the game nor the strategy applied.  The most famous variation of Prisoner's Dilemma is called Tit-for-Tat.  This game's bizarre history is recounted well - it was twice chosen the best option in a contest for \\"best strategy\\".  In this game, a form of Prisoner's Dilemma is played repeatedly - with the caveat that whatever your opponent does, you must respond in kind.  The game's simple rule shattered many myths about the foundations of human behaviour.  Genes may be selfish, but humans are not.  Cooperation has its own payoffs.<br /><br />Once applied only to humanity, game theory has found many examples throughout Nature, and not just animals.  Since part of game theory deals with resource use, even forest trees can be shown to apply it to growth patterns.  Jungle frogs, in their competitive mating strategies make decisions explainable by Barash's matrix diagrams.  How far, then, can its usefulness extend.  As game theory has been demonstrated to have nearly universal meaning, critics have raised objections.  Americans, as Barash carefully notes, find it objectionable on the grounds it shatters their myth of \\"rugged individualism\\" - the notion that success comes to whoever goes out and grabs it by the scruff of the neck, ignoring objections of others.  Others have decried attempts to apply it to every human circumstance.  Barash dismisses this critique as overstated.  Game theory isn't a universal \\"theory of everything\\" - a quest physicists have vainly sought for years.  On the other hand, America, as with every society, must play the Social Dilemma Game - Personal Gain versus the Public Good.<br /><br />Barash's examples are mixed biology, diplomacy, domestic politics and personal encounters.  Although he regrets the little attention paid to game theory by the general public, he ably demonstrates why this book should redress that situation.  Game theory is not a game - it's real life.  This author's perceptive observations and excellent presentation make this work a compelling read.  It's a fine item to have at hand when watching debates, hearing of a new cockpit of potential international conflict or even negotiations between businesses or employment contracts.

You're pretty certain of how it will look when completed.  After all, most people have been exposed to the book's purported topic.  You have expectations of what you will encounter.  Each chapter offers a new piece leading to the assumed final result.  Yet each piece is something of a surprise - an unknown character or an obscure event.  As the image builds, Nicolson assures you of its relevance.  Yet, when the task has been finished, the rendering is almost wholly unexpected.<br /><br />For once, the renaming of a British publication - the original was \\"Power and Glory\\" - was appropriate.  Nicolson opens with the accession of King James I of England, but the VI of Scotland.  This unusual transformation of a monarch brought about a new wave of stresses to a nation that had endured a succession of religious upheavals over the previous century.  From Henry VIII's break with Rome, through an unmitigated Protestantism and sudden reversion to Roman Catholicism, to Elizabeth's long, waffling reign, the British welcomed a king they felt promised religious stability.  They hadn't counted on James' unhappy years under Scots Presbyterian mentors.  Nicolson's depiction of James is of a man almost obsessed with exercising power over religious matters.  If not the subtle initiator, James certainly pounced on the idea of creating a \\"new\\" English Bible.<br /><br />It was an era of Bible writing.  The Douai had been recently produced by English Catholics in exile, while the very Presbyterians James loathed had imported Calvin's Geneva text enthusiastically.  Anglicans had struggled with earlier English-language versions, from Tyndale through the half-century old Bishop's Bible.  Having been smothered by the heavily annotated Geneva version, James was keen to have a \\"pure\\" text.  Nicolson convenes, almost one at a time, the Translator committee to produce it.  Calling them \\"a disparate lot\\" is but mildly descriptive.  There were stern theologians, frowning at any challenge to episcopal prerogatives.  Others were known to weep while delivering sermons.  The Presbyterian presence, no matter how unwelcome in James' view, still had to be tolerated.  The Geneva, as Nicolson notes repeatedly, is what came to the Western Hemisphere on the Mayflower.<br /><br />However pedantic this book might have been in another's hands, Nicolson's characterisations elevate it to gripping reading.  Lancelot Andrewes, the weeping pastor, takes centre stage as the chief Translator - James insisted on the capitalisation.  Andrewes, along with most of the team, was driven by the notion of a monarch closely aligned with the church.  No more backsliding to Rome!  The Puritans, although not yet granted that appellation, wanted even stronger guarantees - bishops were the banana peels leading to papistry.  Get them out!  The tenor, ably captured by Nicolson, is a strong church under a strong king.  Yet among the Translators was one entertaining the most seditious thought of all.  Henry Savile, whose family would later found the London haberdashery locus, had travelled and read probably more widely than any of his colleagues.  Describing him as \\"the most glamorous of the Translators\\", Nicolson also reveals that Savile harboured the idea of a nation without kings!  Savile's experience kept him from the confines of holy orders, but his language capability was undeniable.<br /><br />As the work begins, Nicolson is forced to reveal that almost nothing of the Translators' notes or exchanges has survived.  Although they had access to a large compendium of works by Church Fathers and other commentators, no list of what they consulted is available.  There are some personal journal entries in various locations - mostly uncovered by American researchers beavering away in dusty vaults.  These, however, are but a tantalising sample.  No record of submissions, disputations, arguments or reasons for resolutions are provided.  Instead, we are given Nicolson's paean to the formal language of Jacobean England.  His disparagement of more recent versions isn't even camouflaged scorn.  He longs to return to the subject of his study, but what would be sacrificed to accomplish this end?<br /><br />Although this is supposed to be a study of Jacobean times, there are a few gaps.  The communication between Britain and the Continent, only touched on with Savile, had more impact than Nicolson grants.  Explorers were widening the view of the world, which led many to wonder what the deity had been up to in those remote places.  Within the British Isles, Savile was but a symptom.  The rapid change of faiths led to serious questioning of long-standing dogmas.  If religion could change so often and so dramatically, how could the deity tolerate it.<br /><br />Nicolson ignores the growing tendency to question and the resulting emergence of \\"the village atheist\\" in Britain.  As the most literate people, which Nicolson notes was increasing in this period, it was only logical that questions would increase.  Nor does he see fit to note that the very effort the Translators made laid the foundation for an even greater upheaval in the Puritan Revolution and Cromwell.

It's not enough to locate fossil bones or stone chips as once we did.  Now, where those people lived, what they ate, what environmental conditions they enjoyed, plus a multitude of other factors must be integrated to build a realistic picture of their life.  Not many years ago we could only guess many of these elements.  Fagan explains how today's technologies have taken us far beyond the capabilities of the shovel and brush in revealing details of our ancestors' lives.<br /><br />In this series of accounts, we accompany Fagan on his visits to various archaeological sites.  There, he explains what led to the original find, how it was excavated and what processes were involved in explaining the artefacts.  There are many tools available to the field researcher today.  Most of them are of recent origin and refinements in the future will improve accuracy.  Among the most important of the new technologies is, of course, dating techniques.  Fossils seem almost capricious in their location.  They may be resting where they fell, or earth's many forces may have carried them about.  Streams, tides, scavengers, simple burial practices may place remains in a misleading site.  Radiometric dating methods, the decay of an element into another, has proven the most reliable of determining the age of a find.  The method applies equally to recent skeletal artefacts or evidence from surrounding environment.  Seeds, charcoal from firewood, even the long-dead husks of insects may offer clues to age and local conditions.<br /><br />The various technologies have widened the spectrum of expertise drawn to archaeological sites.  More than simply placing human fossils in a local context, larger patterns are derived from the evidence.  Pollen samples demonstrate whether the ancient inhabitants lived in open plain, scattered woodland or congested forest.  Dung beetles suggest domestic cattle, while other species may suggest thatched houses or stored grain.  Each type of investigation requires a specialist, and one versed in recognising changing conditions as well as static, long-term patterns.  Human uses of wood are many and varied, and the counting of tree rings becomes an important element in both dating and environmental clues.<br /><br />Fagan's personal touch gives what might be a dreary account a vibrant life.  We slog through damp, muddy bogs in Britain with Francis Pryor, sort through Euphrates valley plant seeds with Gordon Hillman, and reflect on Egyptian wine vintages from Pharonic times.  It's not all dry, dusty or boggy antiquity Fagan relates.  In Peru, there proves to be modern application for ancient wisdom.  In the Andean hills, he shows how archaeology can become an applied science.  Techniques for saving water, keeping root crops frost-resistant and utilising soil resources to the fullest that were used by the ancient Incas are now being applied by local farmers.  The Altiplano region, long thought to be too desolate or subject to capricious weather, is now estimated to support up to 1.5 million people using these methods.  The region's populace understands how conditions vary, and have established mutually supportive communities to extend the practices and provide support in stressful times.

In studies of human evolution, dating fossil finds is of paramount importance.  Since the fossil bones themselves carry no signature indicating their age, the placement in time must be done by inference.  The clues lie in the rocks surrounding the teeth, jaws or skulls unearthed.  Ever since Raymond Dart's finding of the Taung Child in 1924, the mysteries surrounding human evolution have been painstakingly revealed.  Dart's discovery, which should have confirmed Darwin's predictions of African origins for humanity, had already been usurped a generation before.  Dutch army surgeon, Eugene Dubois, had already found fossils in Java.  The discovery confirmed what many believed, that human origins were in Asia rather than the Dark Continent.  This new collaboration examines the evidence while making a detailed analysis of the controversy that emerged over our evolutionary track in Asia and Africa.<br /><br />Lewin's hand in this narrative is readily apparent.  He's done many books on anthropology, each one as a close collaboration with the actual researchers.  He evokes the human side of each trip to fossil sites - storm-tossed aircraft, jungle road trips, the frustration of pinpointing older finds, the clash of personalities.  In this case, a fossil unearthed along a riverside seemed to evade identity.  The failure of precise location means the dismissal of dating practices.  Lewin and his team spend much time going over the ways a site is dated and what it meant for another Child, this one known as Mojokerto.<br /><br />Amidst the complications of pinpointing sites, verifying dates and the immense burden of funding multi-national investigations, we are suddenly transported into a maelstrom of professional acrimony.  Curtiss and Swisher's team had been forced into an uneasy association with Don Johanson's [he of \\"Lucy\\" fame] Institute of Human Origins in Berkeley, California.  A private establishment, very loosely tied to the University, contributions to keep it running were, as always, the subject of priority discussions.  The story Lewin relates is reminiscent of theological disputes, with backstabbing, character assassination and explosive temperaments.  While the casual observer would assume the players in this scenario would be working in the same cause, small events exploded into destructive schisms.  Lewin's writing is Swisher's voice, yet the hurt feelings are vividly related.  You are almost sitting at the table witnessing the vituperation.<br /><br />Yet another fossil, with yet another dating crisis, brought what should be the resolution of yet another dispute.  For many years the idea of human \\"origins\\" in Asia persisted, although in different guise.  Dubois 1892 artefacts ultimately fit into a species later termed Homo erectus, an early precursor of ourselves.  A school of anthropologists, led by Milford Wolpoff, has argued that H. erectus evolved into H. sapiens in parallel tracks in Africa, Asia, and perhaps elsewhere.  Known as \\"multiregionalism\\", it is one way of explaining human \\"races\\".

Usually, their writings are in stacks of journal papers, with the occasional monograph highlighting a career.  Journal articles remain buried in academic libraries, down the aisle from dusty tomes.  Dawkins, however, is charged with the task of improving the \\"public understanding of science\\".  With such a mandate, he is free to indulge in some innovative techniques.  In this epic journey through time, he accomplishes that with his usual finesse.  Add the lavish illustrations enhancing the text, and you have an outstanding depiction of evolution's saga.<br /><br />Unlike most general surveys of evolution, this one offers some novel approaches.  First, of course, is its structure.  Instead of vague beginnings, Dawkins opens with a period familiar to all his readers - the scenes around us today.  Moreover, that focus is on the part of Nature of most concern to us - \\"All Humankind\\".  We like to consider ourselves the \\"point\\" of evolution?  So be it, Dawkins declares, but warns that a change in outlook will likely result as you read this book.  From that point, he begins to work backward in time.  He stands Chaucer on his head by adding \\"pilgrims\\" to our journey at certain waypoints.  The \\"pilgrims\\" are the Most Recent Common Ancestor of the present population of creatures.  Since he begins with Homo sapiens, the most recent common ancestor, which Dawkins [rather, one of his graduate assistants] deems a \\"concestor\\", is of course the ancestor of today's chimpanzee.<br /><br />It is a shock to most readers to learn we can make the traverse of nearly 4 billion years in but 39 steps [Hitchcock would have loved it!].  In tracing our mammalian ancestry, Dawkins is able to aid us in peering at the innermost secrets of our bizarre relatives.  We meet colugos and tree shrews, mammoths with tusks like shovels, tarsiers and tigers.  Nearly halfway along the track we are confronted with a superb essay on our nervous system.  Using recent studies of the Platypus, we learn how our brain interacts with the rest of our bodies.  A model human, proportioned to show how much our limbs are represented in the brain confronts us.  Huge hands and lips extend from a minuscule torso perched on spindly legs.  Our grasping abilities clearly helped drive the enlargement of that organ taking so much of our body's resources.  In Platypus' case, the lips play the major role, since this creature uses its unusual properties to investigate its environment.<br /><br />As we progress along the path, the information about our ancestors grows less certain.  Is this creature in the proper genus?  Is this miniature swimmer indeed unique in its classification?  What is the divergent point between mammals and reptiles?  With the introduction of reptiles, the birds finally join the trek.  Dinosaurs, not being in the direct line leading to humans, are given short shrift.  No matter, the books on these long-successful creatures are beyond counting - and the number grows constantly.  Further back, he is able to introduce the unicellular world.  It gives him an opportunity to explain the lifestyle of some of our planet's most fascinating life forms.  Hair-trigger cells that capture food prey or ward off predators.  Glorious, worm-like creatures \\"too good for a goddess\\", despite their human-derived appellation.<br /><br />In his educational role, Dawkins must confront the insidious spread of Christian-inspired simplistic hype over evolution.  He must take up space refuting its propaganda and invalid assumptions.  With so much to cover, this is an unfortunate aside.  Yet in dealing with their rants about \\"irreducible complexity\\", Dawkins demonstrates yet again that Darwinian principles provide the mechanisms for all life.  The energy nodes in our cells, the mitochondria, he reminds us, are the vestiges of bacterial invaders, co-opted to a new role.  Flagella, the great bugaboo of \\"intelligent design\\" adherents, are simply another chemical process.  In his concluding way stations, Dawkins shows how these elements originally lived.<br /><br />Although Dawkins notes throughout the book that science has a formidable task still ahead, with many mysteries to be resolved, this book will long endure.  With its comprehensive scope coupled with the author's always compelling style, it belongs on every bookshelf.  We need more such writers and their books.

From that far-off time when evolution granted us a \\"voice box\\" and a brain capable of expanded memory, \\"telling tales\\" clearly became a feature in our lives.  The hunting expedition, the new discovery resulting from a random trek, \\"what happened to Og during the storm\\", was surely the way time was spent around the campfire after the evening meal.  When speech moved to print, the tradition was carried on to the page.  Nearly supplanted by books growing ever bulkier, filled with too-often turgid text, the short story, in the hands of the right author, returns us to readable prose.<br /><br />Jack Hodgins is the \\"right author\\" in nearly every sense.  His entry into Canadian literature was through a prize-winning collection of tales of his home ground - Spit Delaney's Island.  There was a phase of fusion with The Barclay Family Theatre, a set of vignettes of Canadian life.  From that book, almost as if waiting in the wings, came The Macken Charm, in which another family is portrayed in rather unsettling circumstances.  Yet another family situation, covering vast distances, is his recently released Distance When \\"family values\\" are considered an important aspect, Hodgins is able to convey many facets of that ideal.<br /><br />This collection of ten fine stories combines and enlarges on Hodgins' frequently applied theme of family.  His long writing experience has granted him abilities to characterise matched by few, if any, authors.  The opening story will jolt most readers, yet the young man depicted is anything but a fantasy.  This story of compulsion is followed by a \\"cottage season\\" tale - the consummate Canadian situation.  In Hodgins' account, there are some new twists to what likely would become mundane in the hands of a lesser talent.  In yet another tale, the Mackens' return to confront what, for them, is the least desireable circumstance.  Distant events compel attention to off-Island issues.  Mackens must not only leave their little Island habitat, but travel to that, for them, most inauspicious place - Ottawa.  It's a question of inheritance, perhaps the one thing that can disrupt family life the most severely.<br /><br />Of course, the title story compels the Ottawa reader to wonder - \\"Is this another Ice Storm collection?  Are we going to read about snapped hydro lines, treacherous streets, chilled houses and shattered aboreal stands?\\"  Not quite.  There is a storm, but it's the more typical deposition of a metre of snow.  There's a downed tree, but it reclines in solitary insolence on a railroad track.  The damage lies elsewhere, in the memories of a retired Senator still living in Ottawa.  Coming from British Columbia, Alfred Buckle is still uneasy with snow after all these years.  It's not negotiating snow-covered streets that impairs him, but the recollections of other times and places.  He's on his way to the Grand Opening of his grandson's new establishment.  It's a meaningful event, but one tree may disrupt the journey.  Will he arrive on time?  More important to Alfred, will he be welcome when he does show up?<br /><br />There is a gem tucked away in these pages.  In Australia, Russell Drysdale produced his renowned painting, The Drover's Wife.  It qas long celebrated as typifying the bleak existence of those mustering cattle or sheep.  Australian author Murray Bail finally \\"identified\\" the subject in the painting with a hilarious account of a deserting wife.  In Hodgins' collection, her career takes yet another step with her emigration to Canada.  In his portrait, the Drover's Wife typifies the problems and promise British Columbia faces in dealing with its most precious natural resource.  Hodgins does more than simply graft West Coast conditions to an outstanding and humourous Australian episode.  He brings \\"Hazel\\" to life in ways that lie beyond what even Bail accomplished.  In fact, this lively story has many messages.<br /><br />Not all the tales here are rollicking family disputes or clashes over distant possessions.  In \\"The Crossing\\", Hodgins follows a passenger on the BC Ferries system.  She stands alone, at first, contemplating the approaching coast and mountain background.  She's done this trip before.  It seems to be a family trait to travel - sometimes great distances.  Her father, deluded that he would fare better in the South Pacific, slips away in a sailboat.  Her sister Dora, convinced that she's received secret messages from an alien spaceship, fled into those mountains backdropping the city.  What then, is Leanne's purpose in making this crossing?  Is this truly the shopping trip she announced before departing?<br /><br />Hodgins is a unique talent, possessed of strengths any writer will admire and any reader will encounter with delight.  We need more such.<br /><br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]r /> <br />Not all the tales here are rollicking family disputes or clashes over distant possessions.

That's not quite a real lawman.  He's not certain what it means, nor are the residents of Pine Cove.  In this hidden town on a remote shore facing the Pacific Ocean, Pine Cove's Constable has little to do beyond maintaining the peaceful setting and worrying about his cannabis crop.  His musings are rudely interrupted by a suicide.  The death brings forth minions of the County Sheriff while evokes a spectre of faulty practice to the town's resident psychiatrist.  Another spectre resides in the memories of Molly Michon, former skin-flick Warrior Princess of the Outland who bears a scar that demolished her career.  Still getting jollies when she flourishes her sword, she's a formidable friend.<br /><br />Molly finds a friend - \\"Steve\\" [no relation].  Steve's problem requires lengthy explanation - reaching, in fact, deep into prehistoric time.  Steve is a shape-shifting, pheromone-emitting oceanic resident who's hungry.  And horny.  Piqued by a waft of radioactive leakage, Steve wends his way to Pine Cove in search of meals and mating.  His ability to disguise himself keeps his mass invisible, but his musk attracts susceptible humans in droves.  Molly becomes his mentor and protector, but there are other circumstances interfering with her ability to mother-hen a monster that devours people in a gulp.  What exactly, is County Sheriff Burton up to?  And what do a psychiatrist and a biologist have to talk about?<br /><br />Moore's ability to create characters and circumstances is worthy of much applause.  It's difficult to identify a \\"real\\" person among this assemblage.  Yet, none of them is contrived nor severely exaggerated.  Even Skinner, a rambunctious Labrador, proves a valid depiction.  Psychiatrist Valerie Riordan struggles to keep professionalism, personality and pharmacists in some kind of balance.  The intrusion of the monster lizard [?? - we're not certain of its actual shape] nearly tips the balance.  Moore, by limiting each vignette to a manageable length, keeps the character development and episodes alive and closely present as you page through the book.  It's not something you want to read in bits and pieces - the continuity demands rather close attention.

Never hesitant to propose novel ideas, he incorporates fresh thinking on the cause of our consciousness.  \\"Stories around the campfire\\" depicts his theme - the campfire for cooking meat and the narratives exchanged among the diners.  The meat implies hunting and the conversation implies speech and complex thinking.  Only humans engage in these practices - how did that come to be?  In this provocative and compelling book, Calvin answers this and other questions with his usual expressive style.  Abetted by explanatory diagrams and photographs, he takes us back to a distant time in searching for our origins.  We learn what makes us unique among primates and are given a view of possible future paths.<br /><br />No work in anthropology can ignore our primate relatives.  Calvin's opening chapter asks \\"what is it like to be a chimpazee?\\"  This query raises the point of similarities and differences among primate species.  Apes have fair-sized brains and useful \\"hands\\".  While some hunt, some use tools and all vocalise, only humans developed those capacities fully to create complex societies and learn to write books - or plays and poetry.  All fossil evidence, plus genetics, Calvin reminds us, indicate our origins lay close to what chimpanzees exhibit today.  How did we change from a forest-dwelling ape to one living in nearly every habitat and babbling expressively?<br /><br /> For Calvin, environment shifts are a major driving force in evolution - perhaps none more so than in the case of human evolution.  Variations in climate drives adaptation, and our ape-like ancestors were challenged by some severe, and possibly abrupt, shifts.  More than simply more or less frequent rainfall, these changes modified whole habitats.  Our ancestors had to relocate, shift lifestyles or both.  Calvin argues that the shift meant a new existence, a new diet plus gaining some additional skills.<br /><br />The new diet was meat.  With the human brain consuming 20 per cent of the body's resources just to \\"tick over\\", a high protein source is a necessity.  Primates are mostly vegetarian, with chimps adding some termites and the occasional monkey for dinner.  Shrinking rainforests reduced available fruits and nuts, leaving meat as a more significant diet item for the new ape.  There are two ways of obtaining meat - scavenging it or hunting it.  Scavenging means waiting for leftovers or chasing away predators.  Either is risky.  Active hunting is more direct, but requires complex skill sets involving vision, muscle coordination, memory capacity and predictive skills.  The act of spear-throwing, which Calvin calls a \\"structured suite\\" had to be a \\"package deal\\" of muscle functions directed by a developing cortex.  To Calvin, the \\"package deal\\" implies a sudden rise in evidence for complex human cognition.  With bipedalism a foundation, the new ape could build thinking capacity with tool-making, spear throwing for meat to feed the demanding processor of these activities.  Only after the mind was able to handle involved thinking could language emerge, adding to the brain's capacity, while furthering more cognitive development.<br /><br />Calvin recognises the sudden apparent rise in complex thinking of fifty thousand years ago as a given.  Many recent fossil finds, plus weapons, cave paintings and linguistic analysis support the notion.  While it has taken some time for anthropologists to accept that sudden burst in symbolic thought, it is now the consensus view.  The causes of \\"the Great Leap Forward\\" remain obscure and debateable.  Calvin's proposal will assuredly add to that debate.  Not the least of his critics will be the \\"gender feminists\\" who abhor biological causation in any form.  Yet it's clear his scenario suggests males, as hunters, drove the \\"cognitive explosion\\".  He anticipates the strident chorus that will greet his proposal, but dismisses it easily.  With his engaging style and solid experience in neurobiology, this book will bring new focus to our intellectual roots.<br /><br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Ontario]osal, but dismisses it easily.

Berry recognises the obstructions in transforming a polluting and morally corrupting economy to a less harmful path.  He points to a change in attitude we must all make to prevent catastrophe.  Yet, it's not difficult, he argues, to reassert a more direct tie with Nature such as we enjoyed in our ancient past.  What was once there, but lost, can be recovered.  It merely takes some will.<br /><br />In Berry's view, the Cenozoic Era, used by geologists to encompass modern times, is coming to a close.  Technology and the spread of humanity into nearly every environmental niche have changed conditions too drastically for the older appellation to continue.  The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation over vast areas, huge fishing nets scooping up masses of sea life, and blindly occupying or modifying habitats has led to the extinction of countless species.  What aspects of life characterised the Cenozoic are no longer there to give it definition.  And there's worse to follow if we fail to heed his advice.  Learn to do better, he cautions.<br /><br />Berry restrains his religious background and spiritual leanings to address the larger crisis of the Earth's survival.  There are no lofty appeals to a \\"spiritual\\" aspect of the planet, but he's sharply critical of the materialist outlook that's destroying it.  He insists we consider the Earth as an integrated system, which is a realistic view, given our current piecemeal exploitation practices.  He urges a broader outlook from his readers.  This requires entertaining some novel ideas and encounters with unexpected people.  Indigenous peoples are a good source of wisdom in Berry's view.  However, it's their knowledge he seeks, not the return to an aboriginal lifestyle.<br /><br />The application of knowledge to solve problems in our society is generally conceded to the universities.  From this, Berry concludes that appeals to government or business are essentially wasted effort, unless they understand the impact of their policies.  He suggests that instead of radical environmental protest to save species and habitat, it is the universities who must be enlisted in the cause.  For one thing, the academic arena provides the means of acting as a feedback loop with each cycle increasing the information dividend.  The new findings make their way to the public to support changes in policies.  Although this is obviously not a rapid means of change, Berry finds it the most self-sustaining one.  Once the process begins to unfold, we will be entering the Ecozoic Era with a firmer grasp of our impact on the planet.  \\"The Great Work\\" is thus learning how to move from a human-centred to an Earth-centred set of values.

He's seen them in groups and as individuals.  He's watched them parading along tree limbs seeking fruit, or reaching up to pull branches close for harvest.  He once saw one enter, then leave, a stream, \\"looking for all the world like a swimmer emerging from the surf\\".  These studies have given him some insights to how our ancestors likely went from a four-legged posture to a bipedal lifestyle.  It was a step of profound legacy for us.  Bipedalism ultimately allowed humans to traverse the planet.<br /><br />Stanford's studies have resulted in a work that relies strongly on changes in hominin anatomy.  Bipedalism requires immense changes in skeletal structure, muscle placement and use, the formation of the pelvis, and, of course, the formation of the foot.  These changes must be incremental, he reminds us.  Bipedal walking wasn't an overnight transition.  It took a great deal of experimentation by natural selection to achieve it.  The question of balance loomed large throughout the process.  Our modern bodies have a centre of gravity straight up from between our feet - the chimpanzee's is well forward in its midsection.  It took many evolutionary trade-offs to change from one type of body structure to another.  As the modifications occurred over many generations, the creature carrying them must survive and reproduce to pass these traits on.  Was each step suitably sufficient in its own right?<br /><br />In answering that question, Stanford takes us not only through the likely progression, but also reviews the scholarship attempting to explain them.  He presents the views and counter arguments of the major thinkers explaining the human lineage.  He makes clear that it took many years of study to recognise that bipedalism was the key to becoming human.  To infer what slow, gradual steps were required to bring us upright from the paucity of fossils imparting information leaves many points unresolved.  That gives researchers a broad spectrum of interpretations to offer, but few absolute answers.  Stanford picks through the evidence and the viewpoints, then pronounces his verdict on the most viable scenario.  He's clear on what he favours and why.<br /><br />Some of his judgments are severe, and no few of them are open to question.  Although he offers little of the early hominin social scene, he's quick to dispose of those who have.  His assessment of Owen Lovejoy's scenario of sex playing a major role in leading us to an upright stance is grossly misleading.  He accuses Lovejoy of positing a single cause for this change, when Lovejoy's analysis is anything but limited in scope.  One can almost sense Adrienne Zihlman at his shoulder as he wrote the passage.  Zihlman, a fanatical opponent of \\"women's roles\\" in paleoanthropology, is also a sharp critic of Lovejoy.  Among chimpanzees, the gift of love is meat.  Although Stanford recognises the role of meat protein in aiding in the building of brains, it most certainly played a greater role in our social development than he assigns to it.  This brevity is surprising in view of his earlier books.<br /><br />These shortcomings may be considered as no more than another academic dispute.  That's only true in part.  Bipedalism may be the significant foundation leading to modern humans, but there are other aspects of our lives today with roots in those ancestral changes.  Why did we tend to pair off as mates when most other primates are male-dominated groups?  Why did language evolve to give us enhanced communicative skills?  What led us to use our bipedal skills to migrate so far, so rapidly?  Stanford almost teases us with his sketchy explanations.

With so many options, you may savour some lightly while devouring others outright.  You are, after all, dealing with the grand reach of human existence in this collection.  Closing the final page, you realise that you've consumed a rich variety of samplings of our past.  Fagan has selected over fifty striking accounts of archaelogical enterprise for you.  The tastes run from the romantic to the dedicated scientific.  Whatever your tastes in reading about our past, there's bound to be something to please.  Certainly, there are no disappointments.  As with that selection of chocolates, do you rush to your favourite immediately or \\"save the best 'til last\\"?<br /><br />Fagan organises his selections into three major themes - human origins, \\"great discoveries\\" and the development of archaeology as a true science.  After a fine introduction to his material and a diagram to keep you oriented in time and place, he presents his subjects.  With a descriptive introduction to the writers, he takes you from early humans to historical archaeology.  It's disputable, of course, but Raymond Dart's article on the Taung Baby is likely the best of the first section.  Certainly, no find had greater significance than Dart's realisation that this young, tiny, but ancient creature pushed the beginnings of humanity deeper in the past than anyone had imagined.  The story of \\"establishment\\" archaeologists resisting Dart's assertions needs frequent retelling - if only to prevent recurrance.<br /><br />In \\"The Great Discoveries\\" Fagan shows how archaeology slowly, hesitantly moved from a rich man's [and sometimes woman's] hobby to begin to take its place as a serious science.  Early archaeology sported some memorable characters - among them an Italian circus \\"strong man\\" and diggers who sought to validate the history of the Christian Bible.  Fagan's selections demonstrate how archaeology matured from an off-hand avocation by those seeking to find the newest or more exotic artefacts to a science assessing how our ancestors once lived.  An offshoot of this maturity was the realisation that Western Europe had no monopoly on culture.  With so many of the \\"Great Discoveries\\" being made in African jungles, hidden Latin American sites and forgotten enclaves in Asia, cultural \\"superiority\\" concepts blurred.<br /><br />Archaeology's maturity as a science was delayed until the 20th Century.  Part of the delay was technological - carbon dating, a product of World War II, created unimagined timelines for global cultures.  Darwin's evolution by natural selection blended with Mendelian genetics brought a new aspect of commonality to humanity.  Archaeology turned from pharaohs and kings to village trash heaps and middens.  How people truly lived isn't answered by royal mummies and aristocratic tombs.  Archaeology increasingly focussed on people like those reading this.  The picture they've drawn has achieved a clarity never anticipated by manor lords pondering Stonehenge or the Pyramids.<br /><br />Although nearly all the material in this collection is derived from existing books, this comprehensive collection is unique.  It's an excellent starting point for anyone interested in the history, techniques and personalities of archaeology.

The dittos have the original humans' memories implanted in them.  They are then sent off to accomplish assigned tasks within their 24 hour life span.  A \\"salmon reflex\\" urges them to return \\"home\\" to the rig and upload memories of their day's activities.<br /><br />For Morris' dittos these activities are often investigative.  Albert Morris is a PI [private investigator] - the Sam Spade of the twenty-somethingth century.  Like all such characters, he has led a life fraught with danger, but it's his clay golems who suffer the risks.  Brin, like his predecessors, uses this story to step up the pace of Morris' investigative life.  Inevitably, this means the clone buffer is somehow eroded and Morris must confront his antagonists directly.  Morris is confronted with his own mortality.  Something the clay folk live with each day - for a day.  Albert becomes involved in a typical detective story plot line - twists and turns of conspiracy, counter-conspiracy and unexpected revelations.  Unlike the detective novels of an earlier generation, however, Brin inserts a philosophical spin in this convoluted tale.  It almost fits, but finally fails to find an acceptable niche.  Still, it lets Brin inform us that he's done some reading in serious authors like Roger Penrose.  He's to be applauded for that, but not for how he uses the material in this story.

The next time you're tending your garden, pause a moment.  Consider your position and local environment.  Squatting down or on your knees, reaching around to weed or till, you are likely repeating a similar pose held by your ancient ancestors.  According to Jonathan Kingdon, our African forebears started along their evolutionary path rooting about on the woodland floor seeking dinner.  When conditions changed, they stood up to seek better places.  The result was a questing ape that ultimately filled nearly every useful site on our planet.  It will take serious research, an analytical mind and top-notch writing skills to surpass or supplant this superb study.  Some artistic skills wouldn't go amiss, either.<br /><br />Kingdon has produced the finest work on human evolution since Darwin's Descent of Man.  His focus is our upright stance, but he examines far more than simply physiology in explaining how we expanded around the globe.  The story of human evolution was upended by Raymond Dart in 1924.  Before then, as Kingdon relates, it was believed pre-humans grew large, useful brains before descending from the trees.  Dart's Taung Child demonstrated upright walking developed long before our mighty minds.  Why this was so is a question that has plagued anthropologists for decades.  Kingdon lists thirteen theories for why we stood upright - then demolishes them thoroughly.  He also peels away the idea that there's a clearly traceable lineage of successive steps from early hominins to modern humans.  For one thing, he reminds us, fossil location doesn't necessarily reflect points of origin.<br /><br />The key word in Kingdon's title is not \\"how\\", but \\"why\\".  Each species is adapted to its current environmental condition.  Walking implies relocation and he posits that an East African \\"ground ape\\" likely followed rivers to their origins and beyond in the quest for resources.  At some point, pre-human species became \\"niche thieves\\" - occupying or invading empty or inhabited resource areas.  Vagaries of climate, the onset of disease or direct competition led to further changes in our physiology.  We got better at walking, but we also learned new habits or improved on old ones.  Twigs used to probe for food led to sticks for defence or attack, ending in spears for hunting.  Spear casting is practiced from an early age in hunter-gatherer societies - young boys develop hunting skills through play activities.<br /><br />  The retention of child-like traits is called \\"neoteny\\".  Although this term is usually applied to body forms, especially facial features, it may also refer to behaviour.  To Kingdon, childhood skills encouraged brain development to make us better hunters.  Unfortunately, while granting us more complex reasoning ability, brain enlargement and ingenuity granted us access to a widening zone of niches without giving us insight into the impact of that exploitation.  It has also led to humans setting themselves apart from the remainder of the animal kingdom.  That fallacy, he urges, must be corrected, and soon if our species is to survive.  We must not play with the planet any longer.<br /><br />Kingdon's thorough analysis of who we are and how we arrived at today's condition is unquestionably the best available.  A fine writer, his African origins are reflected in many vignette descriptions of environments and their inhabitants.  In addition to his prose talents is a capacity for vivid illustration.  He presents many evolutionary scenarios that include self-portraits as an element in comparative studies.  This book will endure and should be required reading in any course in anthropology or sociology, let alone ecology.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]ited resource areas.

In this opening salvo of a trilogy on Colombian society and politics, de Bernieres demonstrates his outstanding abilities.  His descriptive powers are vivid, often chilling, in conveying what humans are capable of perpetrating on one another.  He produces characters that prance over the pages in a tantalising dance, challenging you to predict their next outrage or fallacy.  The story is intricately woven through a loom of surprises, tragedies, and disasters.  There are light moments, but they leave you wondering what depth of misfortune is likely to follow.  Lest this analysis leave you feeling the book is depressing, take heart.  The author portrays solemn realism, but swifts and butterflies of hope and satisfaction will reward the reader, even if their passage seems evanescent.<br /><br />The \\"war\\" is more than simply the manifestations of one man's loins.  Don Emmanuel is but one soldier in a wider context.  De Bernieres is here campaigning for a broader sense of justice than this semi-imaginary society has been experiencing.  What is the justice in a village gathering to defend a local, perhaps the last, virgin from salacious soldiers, only to have a grenade slaughtering the inhabitants.  The army, supposedly called up to defend the nation, proves its most rapacious element.  How to halt their depredations becomes the focus of this intricately woven tale.  In one deliciously described sally, the village uses a local, well, \\"experienced\\", young women to visit the army's camp with her charms - and infections, such as neisseria [google it!].<br /><br />This thinly disguised tale of modern Columbia's stresses depicts a society topped by an oligarchy of vested interests.  \\"Right\\" and \\"Left\\" are but easily swopped labels by elements that have no essential differences.  The \\"natural rulers\\" are buttressed by a compliant church, which is far more concerned with its own interests than that of the resident peasantry.  This agrarian foundation of the country, who have little enough for themselves, occupy remote villages while underpinning the urban society.  They are ready victims, easily manipulated or simply ignored.  Their attackers are many and defenders few - yet it is typical of de Bernieres' sense of irony that among their champions stands an Army General.<br /><br />That de Bernieres has copped many awards is adequate testimony to his prowess.  He entertains and informs with equal verve.  A dash of fantasy added to this story brings home the fact that \\"religion\\" is a term requiring expanded definition.  The new definition would encompass human feelings more intimately than our present models.  Death, never welcome, becomes something less than absolute in this author's hands.  If the images he depicts are but our memories of lost loved ones, perhaps we should spend more time celebrating them.  These and other questions permeate this book while prompting us to confront and judge our own values.  If that's de Bernieres' intent, he's succeeded admirably.<br /><br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]little enough for themselves, occupy remote villages while underpinning the urban society.

Restrictions are few - the implausible becomes commonplace, characters achieve extraordinary capacities, and plots may be as convoluted as the author's talent allows. The mundane is invoked only as a form of contrast to inventiveness. Bowering's story of a disenchanted teen-ager seeking her father in a far land isn't new, but her handling of how the narrative unfolds exhibits a poet's novel approach. It's a challenging read for a wide spectrum of readers. <br /> <br />Cathreen seems destined to be drawn into difficult circumstances. She is caught up in the strange disappearance of a school mate. Children, especially teen-agers, can exhibit an inexplicable level of cruelty. Their world, often hidden from parents, can be terrfying. Cathreen's desire to be reunited with her father leads her from one horror to another as she tries to resolve her needs with his. She becomes embroiled in a bizarre community of recluses. Nick, the community's founder, is a \\"back to the land\\" advocate. He attracts a string of characters, including a revived \\"bog man\\". Galt becomes an agent of aggressive loyalties - with fatal results. Cathreen must navigate through this collection of misfits in her drive to join Jag, her father. <br /> <br />Bowering caps her previous stories of mixed fantasy and reality with this tale. As a poet, Bowering brings a different tone to her stories. She's able to mix two genres seamlessly, never allowing fantasy to overcome real-life attitudes and events. If you are a devotee of \\"fantasy realism\\", you will find this a captivating tale. Bowering weaves a vivid tale as filled with human values. Her use of fantasy adds a touch of excitement to her sense of reality. She artfully conveys Cathreen's conern for her father along with her youthful adaptability. A fine book for nearly all ages. <br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]	2004-10-05

Paul Ehrlich enters the lists of \\"nature vs nurture\\" by fulminating against the straw-man of \\"genetic determinism\\".  One would have thought this joust would have been called for \\"time\\" by now.  In his attempt to triumph over this rather ephemeral opponent, Ehrlich has performed a prodigious task.  This well-written and comprehensive view of human evolution is a valuable resource.  A massive footnotes and references collection grants this book value far above the narrative itself.  Ehrlich, a practiced writer and researcher, brings many years of work and observations of the human condition to this massive overview.  He strives to explain who we are and how we arrived at our current stature.  He further warns that our lack of understanding of our backgrounds may threaten our future.<br /><br />\\"Human nature\\" is often cited as a foundation for many behavioural traits.  The fallacy of that moral expression is revealed in the variety of our habits.  Ehrlich recognises that variation in his title and goes on to explain it in this book.  While the genetic foundation of our behaviour is being solidly established by much field research, he ultimately concludes much of that basis is overriden by our cultural influences.  Much of our confusion about \\"nature versus nurture\\", he contends, lies in the rapid pace of humanity.  Compared to most other species, our mental development raced past the other animals - with language as the accelerator pedal.  Since the genetic base for most traits is so slow and nearly muted, our development agriculture, religion and urban society virtually overwhelmed our \\"animal instincts\\".  The prime example, of course, is the massive impact we have on our environment.<br /><br />Ehrlich's key in assessing genetic versus cultural input lies [logically!] in the structure of the brain.  When he wrote this book, the human genome was thought to be comprised of 100 000 genes.  With that figure halved, he concludes the genome hasn't the power to command the billions of neurons with their trillions of connections that comprise the human brain.  This \\"gene\\" shortage, he avers, suggests the genome hasn't the capacity to drive human behaviour to any significant degree.  This rather simplisitic enumeration ignores the fact that the entire genome, whatever the number of genes, must be highly interactive in many areas of the body - the brain is simply another part of the mechanism.  He is apparently unaware of the brain research showing how similar interactions have been mapped within the brain.  Genes merely kickstart the process, they don't need to \\"control\\" our behaviour.<br /><br />Ehrlich takes the usual swipes at Richard Dawkins as he builds his narrative.  Like so many others, Ehrlich's reading of \\"The Selfish Gene\\" appears to have ceased at the title.  To him, the \\"Great Leap Forward\\" of some fifty thousand years ago emancipated us from the shackles of our genetic heritage.  With the development of language [which wouldn't have happened without a biologically endowed \\"voice box\\"], human cognition, hence behaviour, launched on a new course.  Ehrlich asserts we've never looked back, but also warns our capabilities should be adapted to now look forward.  Our abilities threaten the biosphere with an intensity and scope no other species possessed.<br /><br />In his conclusion, the author nearly reverses all his prior narrative.  He urges humanity to develop a better understanding of its place within nature.  That, of course, means a full programme of understanding animal behaviour and the mechanisms animals and plants use to stay alive and reproduce.  Our evolution, particularly the cultural input, has led us to believe we are distinct from Nature.  Ehrlich recognises the dangers of such an attitude and urges us to overcome it.  Although an excellent synthesis and supremely comprehensive, it's unfortunate that Ehrlich's prejudices blinded him to create a problem that doesn't exist.  Nobody argues for \\"biological determinism\\" in an absolute sense - certainly not Dawkins.  Where Ehrlich is correct is that we must increase our knowledge of how nature works and undertake the tasks needed to stop and reverse the spoilage under way.<br /><br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]determinism\\" in an absolute sense - certainly not Dawkins.

True or not, the narrative of Joshua of Nazareth is one of the world's most influential in history.  Moore proposes that the \\"lost years\\" of Joshua's early life would have been recorded but for an unexpected event.  The chronicler died suddenly.  Resurrected in modern times, Levi bar Alphaeus, or \\"Biff\\" from the sound of his mother clouting him, is commanded to create the fifth Gospel.  Sequestered in a St Louis hotel room with an angel who, shall we say, lacks \\"street smarts\\", Biff recounts the life he and Joshua spent as boys and young men.<br /><br />Joshua, in his early years, discovers strange powers.  We meet him resurrecting the lizards his brother kills.  It's a strange ability, although Biff accepts it more readily than does Joshua himself.  As the years pass, Joshua becomes increasingly aware of his divine origins.  He's frustrated by his inability to understand why he has this role.  There are limitations he cannot understand - \\"no women!\\".  Biff struggles to take up the slack in that aspect as they begin a pilgrimage.  Joshua wants to find the \\"wise men\\" who visited the manger at his birth.  They spend almost two decades in Afghanistan, Tibet and India studying.  Along the way, we learn that many thinkers have developed the idea of the \\"Golden Rule\\".  Loving your neighbour is the aim many philosophers wish to impart - if they could but understand how.<br /><br />Biff thinks he knows how - love as many women as willingly cross his path.  He loves Joshua's mother as only a \\"neighbour kid\\" knows how.  His real love, however, is \\"Maggie\\".  Through all his liaisons in far lands, Levi's longing for Mary of Magdalene never fades away.  That her own love is reserved for Joshua is an impediment, but cannot quench his continuing ardour.  Even daily lessons in the Kama Sutra aren't sufficient to drive Maggie from his mind.  Joshua, comfortable in the awareness of Maggie's love, remains celibate - with a twist only Moore could devise.  Don't enter this story thinking that because you know the ending, you're not going to encounter anything new.<br /><br />How valid, even stripping this tale of the fantastic, could Moore's narrative be?  His own statement at end of the book exposes the historical void in Joshua's history.  Challengers to Christianity's divine roots have long questioned how a manifestation of a deity could disappear for a generation.  How unique is Joshua's philosophy of global forgiveness?  Could he indeed have learned these tenets outside Roman Palestine?  Biff reveals [again!] throughout this book the forces Joshua had to contend with in bringing a new teaching to a community overburdened with a legalist religious tradition.

Nate Quinn has journeyed from the vast, frigid wheat fields of Saskatchewan to the warm, comforting waters of Ha'awaii.  He studies whales - particularly the singing career of the humpback.  With veteran photographer partner, Clay Demodicus, he has clashes with officialdom, encounters with The Old Broad, and dealings with helpers.  He suffers the emotional and ethical confusions attending relations with his research assistant \\"the Snowy Biscuit\\" - Amy Earhart.  He's also been frequently married.  Nate and Clay's studies are rudely interrupted by the trashing of their office and the loss of much data.  Who vandalises a cetacean biologist's records?  Who would care?  And who are the \\"silvery grey ghosts\\" that sank the research boat \\"Absolutely Confused\\" ?<br /><br />Somebody, obviously, doesn't want Quinn to learn the meaning of the whale's songs.  It's known that only the males sing, but nobody's figured out why.  While they sing only in certain times and places, the motivation remains obscure.  Territory?  Given the songs can be received thousands of kilometres away, that seems extreme.  Mating call?  The \\"ladies\\" are right in the neighbourhood.  A brief swim brings them together at the proper time.  Quinn's quest gains a surprise boost from an unlikely source.  His New Jersey ersatz Rastafarian helper asks a simple question, leading Quinn to look at his [recovered] data from a different perspective.  As a result, Nate is swallowed by a whale!  Will he ever return?<br /><br />Moore brings a singular level of research and good science to this story.  When a novelist starts reading Daniel C. Dennett and Richard Dawkins as background material, you know there's hope for literature yet.  Nate Quinn's loss at sea initiates a pilgrimage about life's origins and development.  Moore is able to describe life's beginnings, incorporating that knowledge into a slightly modified scenario of \\"what might have been\\".  Or still be when we discover it.  We know what path evolution took.  What other path might it have followed?  Once, the seas were covered with a bacterial film.  What if, instead of parts of it just evolving into separate species, it also developed into super-organism?  Moore uses what he's learned to show us the dichotomy of genetic heritage and the rise of memes in one part of land animal society.<br /><br />In all, this book is an enjoyment at many levels.  Moore's wit and dry humour keep the narrative moving, interrupted only by his imagery - Orcas [killer whales] are \\"just four tonnes of doofus dressed up like a police car\\".  He wants us to know that whales are important, not simply objects to be viewed by \\"eco-tourists\\".  They are our planetary neighbours, thus deserving our respect.

Using the most misconstrued phrase in biology - \\"selfish gene\\" - as a foundation, Eldredge constructs the flimsiest of straw edifices.  The structure, named \\"evolutionary biology\\" is then subjected to ritual ranting and vituperation.  The denunciation focusses on the false idols of Richard Dawkins and Edward O. Wilson.  The chorus of the chant is \\"ultra-Darwinism\\" - a meaningless term incomprehensibly still in use after a generation without definition.  The theme of the exorcism is \\"economics\\".  In countering what he sees as an established dogma of sex drive and reproduction motivating evolution, Eldredge asserts that all life pivots around its economic environment - food and other resources.  How are these obtained, retained and controlled by organisms?<br /><br />The significant organisms, however, aren't elephants or magpies or scurrying mice.  They're humans.  This canon of the Gould-Lewontin-Eldredge cabal - keep humans separated from evolution's process - has long been a mainstay.  For a book supposedly unveiling the mysteries of evolution's long progression, Eldredge skims over other life in his haste to explain humanity.  And he valiantly struggles to do that, but with a novel approach - he focusses on exceptions.  In Eldredge's view, the economic foundation of natural selection is manifested in various cultural norms.  Not all of these are pleasant, of course.  Chinese and Indian cultures weed out daughters [or potential ones] to reduce family costs.  To Eldredge, this somehow refutes the notion of DNA's drive to reproduce itself.<br /><br />An underlying agenda in this book is the long-standing ambition to ease Darwin from centre stage in postulating how evolution works.  Darwin fostered \\"gradualism\\" and Eldredge was part of the team advocating \\"punk eek\\" - the notion that species would reach a state of equilibrium before a \\"punctuation event\\" initiated a new type.  Darwin wrote of \\"sexual selection\\" - almost forecasting how \\"selfish genes\\" worked.  Eldredge will have none of it, instead postulating that resource demands lead to change.  An unfortunate offshoot of his approach is the justification for humans savaging the environment in response to their genetic economic drive.  This, of course, is Eldredge's way of undercutting Edward O. Wilson's hopeful proposal of \\"Consilience\\" as a means of increasing our knowledge and protecting the biosphere.<br /><br />Even books intended for general audiences usually include some further reading recommendations.  Eldredge can't be bothered with this chore, except for some sketchy entries in his Notes section.  His immediate targets are but scantily represented.  The true culprits of overstressing the \\"selfish gene\\" concept turn out to be media writers, not established researchers.  To the initiated, his use of Gabriel Dover in demolishing \\"ultra-Darwinism\\" will come as a jolt.  This blemish is only one pimple in a deeply flawed and misconceived work.  Eldredge fans will rejoice [as will certain anti-conservationists] at this book.  Those who've watched the growing wealth of information on animal behaviour, however, will only wonder at his grim tenacity in holding to false concepts.

This is an excellent introduction to learning about where you stand in the world - literally.  Recently, many \\"popular\\" science books on the mechanisms of our home planet have been published.  Lamb's in-depth experience of geology, coupled with solid writing skills make this book a serious contender for \\"best of breed\\".  Furnished with lavish illustrations, photographs and informative graphs, the book will remain a mainstay for some time.<br /><br />Lamb opens the narrative with an account of the first investigators of rock formations.  Empirical science was struggling for recognition, contending with religious dogma, when James Hutton observed Scotland's rocks with a discerning eye.  Not a challenger of orthodoxy, Hutton's work was to verify the \\"divine plan\\" through Nature.  Later researchers, examining rocks for more practical reasons, began relating fossils to sequences in time.  Thus began the science of geology, resting on geochronology.<br /><br />At best, the early rock maps could only approximate the Earth's age.  Lamb's description of the revelations of sea-floor spreading and continental drift is invaluable.  He gives accounts of the people and projects which pictured activity on the ocean bottom.  Mapping undersea plains and trenches , the discovery of magnetic reversals and how fault lines indicate substructure all contributed to the picture of a dynamic planet.  The development of how continental plates contend for space and what that means for the planet's history is thoroughly and clearly explained.  Lamb is able to encompass a vast amount of information into a small space, yet there is nothing missing in the story.

When an author admits within the first ten pages of the book his title's misleading, readers have a right to be sceptical.  There's much in this book to be sceptical about.  Hamer's thesis is of immense importance and must be addressed - is there a biological basis for \\"spiritual\\" experiences?  How much influence do our cultures impose in how we view the supernatural?  Hamer declares he has the answer - which, he confesses, is hardly \\"a gene\\" as implied by the title.  While  other authors have equated the spiritual and the biological, Hamer is the first to pinpoint a likely trigger for these experiences.  In this very readable account, he explains why he thinks there's a link between genetics and \\"faith\\".<br /><br />Hamer is an avid speculator - he would make a Wall Street broker blench.  He proposed a \\"gay gene\\" in his previous book - a thesis that fell on sterile ground.  In this book, he proposes that a gene acting as a gateway for hormonal activity is the likely precursor for \\"spiritual experience\\".  Combining his own research studies and that of others, Hamer developed a test series for spirituality.  Spirituality is difficult to define, but he adapts the term \\"self-actualisation\\" devised by Abraham Maslow.  Self-actualisation is applied to those declaring, for example, that they're \\"at one with the universe\\".  Although students of the various forms of transcendental meditation more often use that phrase, even adherents of mainstream faiths make similar statements.  Why, Hamer asks, are such declarations so universal among cultures?  And why do more women than men make them?<br /><br />Hamer was introduced to the VMAT2 gene by a colleague.  VMAT2 sits on chromosome 10 and may vary by a single nucleotide.  That variation, according to Hamer, is reflected by the ability of certain individuals to experience self-transcendence.  He calls the variation the \\"spiritual allele\\".  He can use that appellation since further testing showed no relationship of VMAT2 to intelligence or neurotic behaviour.  VMAT2 is a \\"regulator\\" that appears to control the amount of \\"monamines\\" present in the brain.  Monamines are the \\"emotion\\" chemicals - serotonin, dopamine and other compounds that regulate some brain activities.  While many of the details of their impact remain obscure, Hamer postulates that, in the proper environment, these chemicals can give feelings of well-being, anxiety and the other emotions we are familiar with.  He thus equates individual experiences of spirituality with activity from the VMAT2 gene.  The type of experience, he continues, is likely related to the cultural framework of the individual.  It seems clear, but remains to be proven, that the gender difference derives from how VMAT2 relates to genes in the X [female] and Y [male] chromosomes.<br /><br />Hamer builds his case on some highly speculative, but interesting studies.  He cites the SPECT scans of monks and nuns, Persinger's magnetic stimulation of the temporal lobes, and other research in support of his thesis.  He is as methodical as the current information allows.  Various cultural environments are examined, in particular the now-famous \\"Aaron's DNA\\" tracing of Jewish lineages.  While these are solid bricks in the edifice, the structure requires much reinforcement.  The book's presentation rambles into various interesting asides, which might well be relevant.  Hamer fails to draw them together beyond making generalised references to the universality of \\"spiritual experience\\".  His pandering to his US audience in the title would be forgivable, did he not continue to refer the \\"God\\" gene in the text instead of some less absolute term.  His conclusion nearly topples the entire edifice by evading the deity issue altogether.  We are left wondering how evolution provided humans with a \\"god module\\" while leaving the rest of evolution bereft.  Hamer deserves credit for raising the issue of the supernatural as a biological behaviour trait in a comprehensive framework.  However, much work remains to be done.

Her \\"sense-luscious\\" description of the world seizes your imagination, compelling you to learn what she means.  What she means is then paraded before you as a wealth of information clothed in descriptive finery [see how catching it can be?!].  It turns out that the more imagination you possess, the more attuned to the world you can be.  If that sounds vague, it's because it is - and it sets the tone for this book.  Ackerman has a great store of metaphor and illustration to draw upon, and little is left out.  Her prose leaves the reader breathless with its powerful, flowery, imagery.  Add the semblance of scientific references as a decor and you seem to have a book of meaningful insights.  What you really have is a sense of exhaustion.<br /><br />The book's organisation is readily assumed.  The five senses are marched by, each bearing  samplings of how they work in humans and the other animals.  She declares that nothing is \\"more memorable than a smell\\", although it's humanity's weakest sense.  She reminds us that we are predators because our eyes are in front, granting us binocular vision, instead of at the side like prey species needing to keep watch.  Touch evokes a wealth of sketchy assertions about \\"caring\\", especially for babies.  The babies aren't just human, giving that aspect of life a universality reaching beyond generations of teachings.  In dealing with taste, she portrays the Roman elite, with its extravagant behaviour as representing all society.  Hearing, of course, raises the \\"tree falling in the forest\\" question, to which Ackerman responds with a firm \\"No\\", since our brain failed to interpret the quivering air thus displaced.  Helen Keller's pronouncements are given much attention, while Beethoven is granted two partial comments, which turn out to be Deryck Cooke's assessment.<br /><br />Reading Ackerman is rather like taking the ingredients of a cake and consuming them without mixing or baking.  There's a feeling of satiated fullness afterward, but the plethora of different flavours isn't anything as pleasing as a finished cake would have been.  There's much information here, but Ackerman's style is such that you feel compelled to rush through it to see what new metaphors or opulent phrases will arise.  She decribes numerous studies and research, but we never learn who did them, when or under what circumstances.  Her reading list only turns out to be more of the same type of presentation, although clearly none of her \\"references\\" is up to her prose quality.  But then, none of them are poets.  A fun read, and a worthy source to dazzle cocktail party colleagues.  Just make certain none of the other guests knows any physiology.<br /><br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]ing or baking.

Henry Gee is like a hustling salesman.  You can picture him on late-night TV flogging veggie choppers.  While firmly disparaging his competition, he regales you with the wonders of his product.  In this book, the competition is \\"adaptation\\" and \\"convergence\\" in evolution.  The product is \\"cladistics\\".  It's a new way of looking at the physical traits of Nature's plants and creatures and their evolutionary relationships.  Gee is an expressive and persuasive writer.  His foundation in palaeontology gives him an intimate knowledge of the science.  His salesmanship, however, tends to the excessive.  Like the TV promoter's pitch, when you buy the product and examine it closely, you find you've paid for more than you receive.<br /><br />Gee's title, and the premise of cladistics, is that we can't see very far into the past.  Historical continuity, with documents, paintings, letters and memories perhaps reinforced by family ties, doesn't grant us much depth of vision.  How much, he asks, do you know about your great-grandparents?  With fossils, he stresses, drawing \\"family\\" lineages is a process imbued with imprecision.  He scorns anthropologists claiming to see a traceable picture of Homo sapiens' ancestry from to some hillside tooth fragment from the Rift Valley.  He deems all that remote past with its scattered fossils so wonderfully explained by palaeontologists \\"deep time\\".  Which, of course, covers all evolution's history.<br /><br />The author's arguments as he builds his case are multilevel.  He doesn't trust stratigraphy to pinpoint relationships in time - a species \\"A\\" may have survived to live parallel to a new branch \\"B\\".  Yet our fossil sequence may show the \\"A\\" living later than \\"B\\".  That alone, he claims, renders any assessment of adaptations suspect.  Physical traits we see in fossils are often labelled \\"pre-adaptations\\" since it appears \\"primitive\\" traits may have gained in complexity over time to become more useful.  Gee dismisses these sequences as unsubstantiated.  \\"Testable\\" theories of evolution's process become meaningless.  This is hardly news - little in the fossil record is \\"testable\\".  In any case, cladistics wholly ignores evolution as a \\"process\\".  It is a series of snapshots of \\"events\\".<br /><br />Instead of \\"relating narratives\\" as he accuses his fellow palaeontologists of doing, Gee wants them to more closely study physical relationships.  What characteristics can be identified, and how do these relate among species?  Dogs, cats, and cows are clearly four-legged animals with vertebrae.  So are fish, birds and crocodiles.  Cladistics allows you to portray life in new arrangements of \\"cousinship\\".  Gee declares these new relationships allow us to see life \\"as it is\\", not how we \\"want it to be\\".  The relationships are graphically presented in what are known as \\"cladograms\\".  For Gee, these diagrams portraying characteristic similarities are more meaningful than speculative diagrams about descent lineages.  They also, it turns out, support Stephen Gould's notion of \\"punctuated equilibrium\\" over the \\"adaptationist programme\\" of neo-Darwinism.<br /><br />Gee wants to abandon \\"traditional\\" fossil hunting and interpretation with a \\"revolution\\" [his term] - a turnover to cladistics.  His proposal to banish \\"inference\\" from accumulated fossils and their context and replace it with a strict methodology is not sound.  Traits, no matter how ancient or enigmatic, represent the lifestyle of their possessor.  Sciencists may make proposals about how a species lived that are later overturned by new evidence.  Cladistics acts as a tool to assess those evaluations, not overturn them.  The book is valuable for explaining how cladistics can be used.

"	Readers are often intimidated by the challenges presented by climate change.  That's an understandable reaction.  The issues are imposing in their scope and complexity, leading us to ask: \\"What, as an individual, can I do?\\".  That query is substantially answered at the end of this book.  There are good reasons to buy this book and turn to the final chapter: \\"Resources for Citizens\\".  It isn't necessary to read the listings in detail [they're essentially repeated on the website listed on p. 203].  A leisurely survey will indicate the extent of the support readers have to use for learning and deciding on issues to pursue.  When you've finished glancing at what help is there for you, turn to page one and start learning why the resources are needed.<br /><br />Over the years, \\"Gus\\" Speth has risen from tactician to senior negotiator in the campaign to combat the effects of human-generated environmental crisis.  His experience and ability to impart clearly the history, tactics, successes and failures of the environmental movement are brought to bear in explaining what has been achieved, and what remains to be done.  Speth is adamant that many tasks confront us and we'd best get started on them.  He explains how the early environmental movement overfocussed on specific topics.  Victories, such as the ban on PCBs to reduce the \\"Ozone Hole\\" are welcome, but leave both participants and the general public unwarrantedly satisfied.  Climate change is too great a realm to overcome by a few successful skirmishes.  Fundamental changes are needed - starting with cultural outlook - do you believe your current lifestyle will endure?<br /><br />Climate change, he reminds us, is a global issue.  Hence, a stress on international action is fundamental to addressing the problems.  Why, he asks, are there United Nations organisations on health [WHO], food [FAO] and labour [ILO], but none on the environment [WEO]?  Such an organisation at the highest level is required for studies, planning and administration.  The disparity of pollution generation among nations, especially that of the United States, clearly indicates the richest nations must take the lead in curbing emissions while developing environmentally friendly technologies for developing countries.  He points out that some nations have already taken steps that are exportable.  Denmark's massive development of wind power is being duplicated in Germany and Spain.  Each of these countries, with lower population and resources, already has greater wind energy capacity than the United States.<br /><br />Offering a programme of eight \\"transitions\\" that must be undertaken, he lists population control, poverty elimination, improved technologies, realistic pricing [what are the real costs of pollution and who bears them?], learning and research, and proper governance among his goals.  All these are achievable - it merely takes an informed public and leaders to implement them.  First and foremost, we must shed the dogma Speth calls FROG - \\"First Raise Our Growth\\".  This mantra drives thinking in industrial nations, and too many developing countries feel they must subscribe to its tenets.  Failure to overcome this \\"business-as-usual\\" theme will only lead to environmental catastrophe.<br /><br />Speth isn't urging strong governmental action \\"from above\\".  Quite the reverse.  He examines the mechanisms that have been tried through this method and finds them too rigid.  Instead, he proposes more flexible and more local initiatives must be encouraged.  He applies the term JAZZ, reflecting the innovative and unstructured methods of that music form.  Contributions are encouraged from many sources, applying many styles, producing a variety of results.  Those that can be successfully applied elsewhere will be adopted.  In his scenario Speth leaves no doubt that individuals play the most significant role.  As a builder rather than destroyer, Speth is a voice to be heeded - now!<br /><br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]ttawa, Canada]	2004-09-01

Long dominated by measurements and struggles to pinpoint sources, this book describes how people are affected when weather becomes chaotic.  As a collection of \\"dispatches from the frontlines\\" it chronicles what our neighbours [and ourselves] are experiencing.  How are people coping with rising sea levels, shifting landforms and waning resources?  This outstanding anthology of essays may be rightly equated with \\"war reporting\\" since it covers the battles for survival we are now engaged in.  The only missing elements are generals to lead the fight and strategies to apply.  Both are sadly lacking.<br /><br />In but ten essays, the various authors portray changing local environments around the planet.  Asian, European, North American and Pacific conditions are reported and comparisons offered.  In Europe, Denmark stands as a bastion against polluting energy sources while enjoying continued prosperity.  There, wind energy is being utilised to curb fossil fuel power station emissions.  The turbines are finding markets in other EU nations, particularly Spain and Germany - each of which have greater windpower capacity than that of the United States - a telling statistic.<br /><br />North Americans are slow to see the reality of conditions elsewhere.  Asia, with its still burgeoning population, relies heavily on polluting fuels.  Wood, pressed coal, even dung, all remain major fuels for heating and cooking - fundamentals in daily life.  Such fuels produce soot and dust, which have produced a cloud over the Indian Ocean covering 10 million square miles.  More than just an irritant - \\"you get used to it\\", one author relates - the cloud interrupts the food chain at sea.  High altitude winds bring the particles to North America's West Coast.  The dust bears micro-organisms as cargo, leading to \\"unexplained outbreaks\\" of viral infections.  From the other direction, one-inch grasshoppers from Africa have appeared in the Caribbean.  Clearly, the scenario is global.<br /><br /> Above the Caribbean, New York is already seeing the impact of rising sea levels.  Wetlands are \\"developed\\" or flooded by salt water.  \\"Exiled\\" species have nowhere to move, thus die out for lack of habitat.  In the West, glaciers are shrinking, depleting the available water supplies for growing cities and struggling farms.  Fish stocks are declining with the water loss.  Warming oceanic water leads to species moving into new habitats.  While this may be of temporary benefit, major foodstock species are losing ground, cascading the impact throughout the ecosystem.<br /><br />The picture is grim, but not hopeless.  Mechanisms exist to reduce the growing problem, but they must be more fully adopted.  Motavalli is unequivocal in his denunciation of the current US administration.  Compounded by media withdrawal of criticism, he argues that a \\"Manhattan Project\\" level of action is required.  Motavalli argues that the Bush administration has declared \\"we must simply adapt to climate change\\" is foolish and shortsighted.  A declared intent to build up to 1900 new power plants in the US \\"is a prescription for  climate chaos\\".  Existing technologies, such as Denmark's wind power example, would provide non-atmospheric warming energy.  Failure to adopt the Kyoto Protocols was a major step backward in preventing worsening climate impact.<br /><br />If the articles aren't descriptive enough, the book includes a superb photo essay by Gary Braash.  This vivid series of images depict the shrinking glaciers, melting Antarcic ice pack - the greatest source of water raising sea levels, and increasing severe weather events.  Emaciated polar bears, parched landscapes and homeless penguins may seem like distant, unrelated circumstances, but they reflect a growing global reality.  Motavalli stresses that the world's most powerful, and most polluting, nation must be the one to take the most significant steps in curbing these degrading conditions.

From  that era of tulmutuous fortune-making, Prohibition and \\"boosterism\\", many tales and no end of scathing criticism have been derived.  \\"Boosterism\\" was the phrase applied by  businessmen touting their communities as forward looking, progressive, expanding.  Government at all levels, in their eyes, existed solely for the purpose of providing what is now called \\"infrastructure\\" to assist in \\"development\\".  Underlying this promotional attitude were the hidden lives of the people.  Jorge Amado demonstrates that the phenomenon wasn't restricted to the North.  In this bizarre novel of a Brazilian community, he portrays the clash of tradition and \\"progress\\" in a different environment.<br /><br />Gabriela, a migrant worker, arrives in Ilheus.  A town braced by the sea and extensive cacao plantations, it was founded in violence and is sustained by fear.  The skirmishes that created the plantations left an oligarchy of \\"colonels\\" dominating the society and politics of the region.  Honour is the rule, backed by a tradition extending back to Iberian aristocrats.  Allegiances are fixed and endure long.  Challenges to the Establishment are met with swift, violent response.  Gabriela, originally a distant viewer of these clashes, is ultimately and intimately drawn into them.  Amado's picture of this rigid social milieu and how it effects the innocent, demonstrates the power of money and character against tradition.  The conclusion is anything but foregone, as he depicts the plots, subterfuge and ferment resulting from the jousting contenders.<br /><br />The challenger is Mundinho Falcaho, young, ambitious and full of fight.  He deplores the favouritism government shows to other communities.  He wants \\"progress\\" and improvements for Ilheus.  The pivotal element couldn't be more mundane - a sandbar in the harbour blocks the entry of ocean-going ships.  Around this issue, Amado builds a story of intrigue, power manipulation and, amazingly, fierce and tender romance.  In this stark tale, the characters are flexible and learn to adapt.  The \\"Turk\\", a Syrian-born bar owner, learns how to evade the code imposed on betrayed husbands.  The humour, and this story is lightly told, is muted - as is the tragedy.  There's little to laugh at, here, but no tears should flow.<br /><br />Amado, once a Nobel nominee, would appear dated today.  That shouldn't detract from the power of his prose.  His portrayal of women would bring down scorn from a segment of today's society, but he is depicting a distant time and place.  Such criticisms should be curtailed unless you've lived that life.

While North Americans can rejoice in casting off hereditary monarchy, Latin America has been gripped by a far stronger and enduring set of bonds - culture and tradition.  When Spain ruled these lands, great haciendas, usually built on royal land grants, were ruled by titled aristocrats using armed vaqueros and the Church to maintain social quiet.  Today, it's drug lords and paramilitary squads but the structure has changed little.  While an established anti-establishment stable of writers in Latin America have mildly flourished [those that have survived], de Bernieres intrudes as an outsider to bring a fresh, vivid and disturbing view of this society.  His imagination is boundless and his capacity to impart his visions is peerless.<br /><br />Vivo Dionisio is a philosophy teacher - young, vibrant and, of course, idealistic.  He's also articulate, which leads him to pepper the great newspaper, La Prensa, with complaints about the drug lords.  In particular, the local padrino, El Jerarca.  An obtuse, obese, and overbearing man, he views Senor Vivo as a threat to his hegemony.  Most powerful men in such societies can dominate the local police.  Here, however El Jerarca must contend with a philosopher police chief, Ramon.  While Ramon is powerless to deal with the drug czar, he is anything but submissive.  He cheerfully retrieves the corpses El Jerarca's men leave in Dionisio's front yard, hoping to find a niche in the drug lord's armour.  Dionisio may provide the key - if he survives.<br /><br />Dionisio, however, has many interests.  Among the most demanding is his new-found love, Anica.  Anica is the epitome of the spirited Latin lover - intense in all her interests, devoted to the man she loves, tragic in her desire to preserve and protect Dionisio.  His response to her is almost a cliche of Latin American writing, but with a humanity rarely seen in such literature.<br /><br />De Bernieres portrayal of people and events is matchless.  His novel approach, categorised by some as \\"magical realism\\", keeps this book lively, entertaining, but fraught with a need to expose injustice.  His knowledge of Columbian society, with its many disparate elements, is vast.  He weaves these many threads together in building a seamless tapestry of politics, magic, tradition and affection.  Violence is a fundamental element, with all forced to contend with its pervasive role.  Happiness is balanced by tragedy and grief in ways that leave the reader breathless.  This is an admirable work, with black humour and deep ironies.  Read it and enjoy the work of a writer of peerless prowess.

"	Once, i hoped for a truly comprehensive survey of the British Empire and its global impact.  This excellent book is almost the response i wished for.  Colley examines \\"a quarter of a millennium\\" in an overview of three stages of Britain's expansionist adventure.  From the start, she reminds us, Britain's miniscule population and limited resources made it an unlikely candidate for global expansion.  Contending with nations better prepared or more experienced in empire-building, the founding of the British Empire was typified by false starts and unlikely events.  In using the accounts of prisoners - kidnappees, prisoners of war or other captives, Colley is able to point out how both public views and policies changed during the growth of the Empire.  Most important, she argues, is the need to dispel notions that the empire was monolithic in concept or development.<br /><br />Clearly organised and written with clarity and intensity, Colley opens her study with an example of glaring failure.  How many remember Britain's occupation of Tangier on the west coast of Africa?  The city was part of a queen's dowry in 1661, giving Britain a control point over the Mediterranean trade routes [Gibraltar came under British power in 1701].  With Spain, France and Italy, not to mention the Dutch, all expanding their sea-going commerce, Tangier was a key location.  The British poured immense sums into Tangier to create a fortified city, but it was lost less than a generation later.  Colley explains how relations with the \\"Barbary\\" states of North Africa drove British foreign policy for many years.  Those relations included ongoing efforts to redeem captives taken by corsairs, swift vessels that even raided coastal areas of the British Isles.<br /><br />Britain's next expansionist efforts were even less calculated - the settlement of North America.  While religious and other dissident groups founded communities along the eastern shores of North America, Britain's policy toward them remained ambivalent.  Unlike the mostly military Mediterranean and Indian ventures, Colley says, North America focussed on settlements.  When captives were taken, they might thus be whole families, with a wide age range and including more women that would be the case elsewhere.  Accounts of captivity, therefore, were different from Tangier.  Men taken by the Barbary corsairs might adopt local dress, customs, language, even Islam.  This blurred the image of Muslims as the Other - an identifiable enemy figure.  In North America, as colonies expanded, the Native Americans became more demonised in tales of warfare and capture.  Even so, she notes, the North American enterprise was \\"poly-ethnic\\", with many nationalities arriving and the use of favoured Native American tribes as allies.<br /><br />Britain's Indian incursions, Colley points out, added new dimensions to imperial imagery.  Severe defeats and sepoy [Indians acting for British rulers] uprisings forced reflection on colonial costs and eroded prestige.  Captivity accounts expanded knowledge of the culture of the subcontinent, demonstrating how many aspects of Indian life might be adopted - even brought home to Britain.  Yet, captive accounts are generally sparse or non-existent.  The Mysore wars created a population of captive soldiers held in recessed dungeons, but not one account of their ordeal reached print in their lifetimes.  By the era of Victorian Britain, tales of captive life were nearly \\"airbrushed from history\\".<br /><br />Given the location of some of her areas of study force comparisons to modern situations.  Afghanistan has been the subject of outsider invasion more than once.  Each time, while declaring they intended \\"no war on the Afghan people\\", people died as the intruders sought to install unpopular leaders on them.  Inevitably, the result was embarrassment for the invaders and incarceration of their troops and civilians.  Thus, even at the end of the period of Colley's study, she notes that theBritish Empire was still being  consolidated haltingly.  Uniformity, never a well-defined condition of the enterprise, remained lacking.  Defeats and losses through captivity brought criticism and demands for redemption of captives.  It failed to halt the expansionist nature of British policy, however.<br /><br />Colley's book opens a new phase in historiography.  Her eloquent style keeps this book alive for the reader at all times.  Those thinking history can only be \\"dry\\" when written by an academic are in for a pleasant shock in picking up this book.  Well illustrated and containing a rich bibliography, students of empire will welcome this book on their shelves.

"	This quote from Birds Without Wings sets the book's tone. \\"All men are brothers\\" is a theme weary from overuse. Yet de Bernieres manages to portray it in a novel fashion within an unexpected environment. In school most of us learned of \\"the Sick Man of Europe\\" - the Ottoman Empire that once wrapped the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. \\"Corrupt\\" was the word usually applied. Throughout the 19th Century the Empire was chipped away by rising nationalist forces. Within the Empire's core, however, de Bernieres portrays a land of ethnic mix, kept stable by a tolerance for neighbours. The dominant Muslims appeal to the Orthodox Christians' Mary for aid. The Christians, in turn, recite prayers while prostrating in the Muslim fashion. A Greek teacher writes letters - in Turkish, but written in Greek script. All these elements are skillfully woven in this masterpiece of fictional history.<br /><br />Yet, as de Bernieres chronicles, this tightly integrated society, typified by a village on Turkey's southwest coast - Eskibahce, was shattered. Riven by hostilities, broken up and rendered a pitiful remnant - why did this idyllic situation fail? Not Ottoman \\"corruption\\" but the forces of \\"European Civilization\\" intruded on these people's lives in devastating ways. To the people of Eskibahce, all Europeans are the mysterious \\"Franks\\". There are German Franks, French Franks, British Franks, even Australian Franks - all Christian, but as Eskibahce will learn, not the Christians they are familiar with. Whatever else these Franks are, they intrude on the Ottoman society and politics. The Empires built in Europe during the 19th Century, chipping at the Ottoman hegemony have now erupted into a Great War. Eskibahce's sons go off to fight, but the demands of war prove greater than simply acquiring cannon fodder. \\"It was an age when everybody wanted an empire\\", de Bernieres writes, undertaken with no thought to the cost.<br /><br />De Bernieres uses a full stage of characters to weave his story of two decades of tumult and change. Few are admirable, but all intensely human - birds without wings. Rustem Bey, a Muslim landlord, travels in search of a replacement \\"wife\\" to portray the ways of Ottoman cities. A Muslim boy - inevitably - is stationed in Gallipoli. Through his eyes we are given an uncompromising picture of war's horrors. And its lighter moments. Philothei, a beautiful baby, becomes lovelier with maturity. It's symptomatic of the author's sense of irony that her beauty brings demands to veil her face - even though she's Christian. All the women then adopt the veil to pretend beauty. A potter saves needed money to buy a gun - for what purpose? One figure, however, pervades this story - Mustapha Kamal. He will change the Ottoman Empire into the nation of Turkey. In so doing, everything Eskibahce represents is swept away with devastating results.<br /><br />With a string of excellent writings to his credit, de Bernieres has here produced a masterpiece. It takes immense skill to create a continuum from so many and varied parts, yet he achieves it admirably. \\"Where does it all begin?\\", he asks. The book is a response to the query, but not an answer. War, the great destroyer, has many causes and unexpected results. The Ottoman Empire is transformed into Turkey, a more easily identified entity - a whole derived from parts. In Eskibahce, the effect is schism, disaffection and dispersal, leavened by compassion and generosity. Are there winners, or merely survivors?

Reading some of Truss' [watch that!] examples of how poor punctuation can impair communication will give you pause.  If we fail to use language that imparts meaning, how far along the evolutionary track have we progressed?  For Truss, the \\"English\\" language, with its national subdivisions, seems to offer almost insurmountable barriers to good communication.  Yet, those barriers are all so tiny - commas, dashes, periods - how can they obstruct meaningful words and phrases?<br /><br />The title, with its complex scenarios imparted by a tailed dot, says it all.  Pandas either run amok in restaurants, or they quietly munch on herbiage in some mountain retreat.  One comma transforms completely the meaning of four simple words - without even changing their order.  While adolescents bemoan the rite of learning to write clear sentences, Truss makes abundantly clear why the discipline must be endured.  If you wish to deal with our society, conveying your meaning can be vital.  We've all been inundated with occurances of \\"No.\\" versus \\"No!\\"<br /><br />As with anyone who is jarred by its misuse, Truss is particularly insistent that we properly  apply this little comma with an attitude.  We're all familiar with the \\"greengrocer's\\" syndrome of unwarrentedly applying it to distort a plural.  The famous problem of \\"its\\" versus \\"it's\\" where a possessive doesn't take the mark and the contraction does, still defies easy solution.  The remedy, of course, is to say to yourself what you're typing - forcing a pause in the narrative flow.  Like learning to ride a bicycle, a little practice brings easy familiarity.  The next most obvious stumbling block is that of people's names ending in \\"s\\".  Sticks and stones will never convert me to writing \\"Haines's\\" - try saying it aloud.<br /><br />Truss's [wot?] style keeps you moving easily through this book.  She's able to insert historical references gracefully, the information helping the flow of her presentation.  Her hero, one Aldius Manutius, developed many of the text clarifiers we take for granted today.  Printing, unlike handwritten manuscripts, demanded standards of readability.  Manutius met that need with italics and semicolons, among other innovations.  Truss, while not inventive, applies a fresh approach in helping us learn from his example.  Purists, of course, may deplore her brash style, but when was the last time you picked up a Fowler?<br /><br />If this book has a fault, it's the overly British tone Truss necessarily sets.  While she offers some examples of \\"Americanisms\\", they are little short of condescending.  \\"Inverted commas\\", one of the least meaningful phrases in English grammar, will never overcome \\"quotation marks\\" in depicting what that punctuation accomplishes.  Commas, as Truss emphasises, are a reader's sign to \\"pause\\".  Quotation marks have no such role except to signal the end of speech.  Nor does she note how much American rules have permeated other English-writing nations like Canada or Australia.  Perhaps she failed to anticipate the wide acceptance of this book.<br /><br />Such points, however, are minor and don't dilute the worth of Truss' [!] effort.  Her theme is improved communication.  In a world where punctuation rules are written by Hollywood and the plethora of \\"Sun\\" newspapers, this book is invaluable.  It belongs in the Christmas stocking of every child and should be quietly slipped into the hands of email devotees and business memo writers.  Buy it, read it, and most importantly, put it to use.

The early efforts were in academia: Gross and Leavitt's \\"Higher Superstition\\" and Koertge and Patai's \\"House Built on Sand\\".  Christina Hoff Sommers expanded the scope with \\"The War Against Boys\\".  Neil Boyd has broadened the view to the general social scene with this work.  His analysis of how radical feminism has twisted the law and justice is open, honest and fair.  Not to mention devastating.<br /><br />The root of the Big Sister phenomenon lies in the false perception of men as inherently \\"guilty\\" - just of being male.  \\"Big Sister\\" is derived from the Orwellian concept of Big Brother - the overweening force that changes language, redefines what is acceptable and what not in precise, simplistic terms.  Values are established by a few strident voices, which become the sole authority on \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\".  Justice readily falls victim to a new dictatorship of \\"women's rights\\" as due process is shelved.  Boyd argues that laws have been and are being rewritten, often by judicial fiat.  The image of Big Sister, then, is that of a restricting force relying on social division, deception and bad science to enforce an agenda.<br /><br />He surveys four social issues that have been the subject of various legislative actions: pornography, sexual harassment, sexual assault and domestic violence.  His demons underlying much of these topics are the University of Michigan professor Catharine MacKinnon and \\"self-proclaimed radical activist\\" Andrea Dworkin.  These, and other strident voices, are the apostles of a \\"radical - even poisonous\\" strain of feminism.  Their claims of the \\"predatory nature\\" of men are regularly repeated in campus lectures, in lobbying for restrictive legislation and their concept of social conformity.<br /><br />Boyd accepts they have enjoyed a measure of success, partly because their vehemence convinces the innocent or overwhelms opposition.  MacKinnon, nearly single-handedly, drove a significant change in the Canadian Criminal Code with the insertion of the phrase \\"degrading and dehumanising\\" in gender relations' legislation.  Although the \\"age of consent\\" here is fourteen, MacKinnon's efforts made possession of visual material depicting merely nude figures a crime for anyone under eighteen.  Boyd further counters their claims that pornography \\"breeds violence\\" or \\"promotes exploitation\\".  Studies, ignored or rejected by the campaigners, show no such relationship, he declares.  He argues that the type of censorship laws urged by Big Sister advocates is \\"hate propaganda\\" similar to anti-Semitic, racist or anti-Asian demagogues.<br /><br />In the realms of \\"sexual harassment\\" and \\"sexual assault\\", Boyd lists numerous cases of special pleadings, selective acceptance or use of evidence and twisted interpretations of \\"consent\\".  \\"Harassment\\" has become a term of such broad definition as to be meaningless.  Careers, home life and other social capacities have been disrupted on minimal or spurious claims.  \\"Assault\\" also lacks clarity, which hasn't prevented harsh interpretation.  Some judgements rendered verge on the equivalent of a \\"Monty Python\\" skit with demands for clear and unequivocal expression of consent at each stage of an encounter.  The onus of proof, of course, lies with the initiator.  As Boyd demonstrates, even that identity is elusive in today's environment.  The same problems hold in cases of domestic violence, where the aggressor remains unclear or ambivalent.  \\"Zero tolerance\\" legislation has broken families, cost jobs and induced new stresses in family dealings.<br /><br />Boyd's conclusion is straightforward, almost simplistic.  As a long-term advocate of gender equality, he wishes to \\"restore the lustre of a tarnished feminism\\".  To accomplish that end, he calls for readers to speak out against injustices, mythologies and heresies.  Pornography doesn't incite violence; harassment charges must be substantiated clearly, domestic violence statistics must be realistic, and absurd reconfigurations of the notion of consent must be undone.  Mean-spirited intolerance, he urges, must be overcome.

Reading mystery novels, like reading fantasy or theology, requires only suspension of disbelief in the implausible.  And patience - convoluted plots are the norm, with twists and turns the protagonist [and reader] must endure until resolution and clarity appear.  Protagonists are, perforce, heroic - people capabable of superhuman endurance, cleverness and insight.  All are usually well beyond normal experience.  Readers are kept at the page-turning chore to see \\"what happens next\\".  With some writers, this is a boring task.  In the case of a talented writer, the task turns into a pleasure.  When the writer has additional capabilities, which Hoeg possesses in abundance, reading becomes a joy.<br /><br />Hoeg's story of Smilla Jaspersen, Greenland raised but now Kobnhavn resident, turns on his ability to convey a wealth of information.  Disturbed by the falling death of a child afraid of heights, Smilla embarks on a quest to learn the truth.  The crusade brings her into confrontations with stultifying bureaucracy, ruthless enterprise and conscienceless hostility.  There is a deep, underlying situation behind Isaiah's death.  Smilla must peel away many layers of obfuscation and conspiracy.  It's an overwhelming challenge, but her sense of justice has been offended.  She wants answers and will endure much to find them.  It all begins with footprints in the snow.<br /><br />Hoeg, of course, has crossed into a \\"forbidden zone\\" - the male writer portraying life through a woman's eyes.  Does he succeed?  Of course.  This issues in this story aren't \\"women's ways of knowing\\", but how a dedicated individual pursues a goal.  This isn't the portrayal of \\"woman\\", but of one woman in specific circumstances.  Smilla's background is hardly typical of women in general - her Greenlandic, half Inuit roots make her a character of many levels.  Are the men Smilla encounters real or the artifice of a male writer?  Smilla, a lone woman in her mid-thirties, has few illusions.  She's tough, resourceful and vulnerable all at once.  The men Hoeg confronts her with have a wide spectrum of attributes.  Moral questions are raised and adroitly dealt with.  None are simple or readily resolved.  Smilla copes in her own manner, not in any generic sense.  Among other aspects, Smilla is deeply concerned about Europe's, particularly Denmark's, views on the \\"outside world\\".<br /><br />The author takes us through several new worlds.  Few \\"mystery\\" novels exhibit the insights and technical comptence Hoeg displays.  It isn't \\"Smilla's sense of snow\\" we encounter, but Hoeg's.  The Greenland Ice Cap isn't familiar territory to readers of \\"detective stories\\", but he introduces us to that alien environment.  Why must ships not engage in communication at certain times?  Hoeg explains this and other aspects of the shipping world with ready intimacy.  Each new milieu comes alive and vividly real in his portrayal.<br /><br />Calling this book a \\"mystery\\" is, of course, a gross oversimplification.

In hands of an innovative stylist like de Bernieres, the read is far more - \\"invigorating\\" becomes a soft term.  His facile style and comprehensive imagination produces a story of limitless value.  While steeped in the real world, he introduces a new version of what has been termed \\"magical reality\\".  Events have a historical base, characters are real, or are at least plausible composites.  You are reading history through only slightly distorting spectacles.  The deformation allows him to shift from history to parody.  Under his skillful touch, nothing in the image is lost, but a wealth of insight is gained.<br /><br />In this final volume of a trilogy, he depicts the life of a Latin American cardinal - a \\"prince of the church\\".  Guzman suffers terrible pains and horrific visions.  Demons, each with a particular role to play, appear to torment him.  He's virtually incapacitated during these attacks.  The ministrations of his mistress, Conception [what else?], are futile attempts at the application of folk medicine.  Only their son, Cristobal, seems capable of alleviating the Cardinal's agonies.  Yet even this happy therapy provides fresh challenges to the cleric.  Guzman's familial problems aren't limited to this illegitimate child.<br /><br />Key chapters in this volume are comprised of a letter to the Cardinal from The Holy Office.  The letter aptly summarises the career and impact of the Church in his domain.  It's a wonderfully scathing account of the hypocrisies perpetrated upon people in the name of divinity.  Part of Guzman's tribulations relate to the letter and its account of the country.  You will be returned to it from time to time.<br /><br />While the Cardinal suffers, the population of a mythical city, Cochadebajo de los Gatos [look it up] find themselves under siege.  They have a special relationship with the region's jaguar population, who act as an enlarged, and rather more accommodating, version of the domestic house cat.  The siege allows de Bernieres to introduce yet another anomalous character in the person of the British Ambassador.  After reading about his antics and treatment by the locals, it says something for British forbearance that de Bernieres was allowed to take up a London<br /><br />residence.<br /><br />De Bernieres' view of Latin America is, dare it be said, \\"catholic\\".  He incorporates the Conquistidore traditions, the mixed roles of the Church, from hierarchical absolutist through evangelical zealots to radical Marxist reformers.  The Indian population, mestizos, a lone Mexican, legions of peasants, aloof aristocrats all enter the stage.  Few leave unbesmirched, usually through their own actions.  Even the nation's President and his bizarre wife are woven adroitly into the narrative.  No leader of a \\"banana republic\\" could suffer more at the hands of rebel forces than President Veracruz.  De Bernieres gives him a slogan rich in irony, given the circumstances: \\"Democracy Is Safe In Our Hands\\".<br /><br />This author has produced a string of successful works, with each seeming to outshine the preceding volume.

Dever deserves a blue ribbon for the most cumbersome title in many years.  He should also garner an award for his blistering assessment of \\"postmodern\\" historians.  While he has contested \\"minimalist\\" academics elsewhere, this book is an excellent compendium of the issues and evidence regarding the historical validity of the Hebrew Bible.  Although the arena of biblical history is small, the issues dealt with are important.  His conclusions will have lasting impact not only in biblical history, but archaeology and other disciplines.  Although a serious subject, Dever's piercing wit keeps this book a lively and captivating read.<br /><br />For generations, Dever tells us, the history and archaeology of Palestine have been restrained by biblical texts.  Instead of scholars seeking for what is \\"there\\", they spent energy trying to verify what the Hebrew Bible related.  A shift in attitude brought more detachment in reporting finds.  In parallel with new textual analyses, field reseachers uncovered evidence that places and people named in the Hebrew Bible likely existed, but within a different context than related in \\"The Book\\".  Regrettably, the \\"different context\\" attracted the attention of yet another academic element - the \\"postmodernist, deconstructionist nihilists\\" who simply abandoned any notion of historical veracity of biblical accounts.<br /><br />Dever turns his scholarly attention and biting prose to counter this group of \\"critics\\".  Apart from refuting slanderous charges of fabricating and destroying evidence, Dever shows how the postmodernists have little or no foundation for their judgements.  They fail to recognise archaeological data.  They dismiss or ignore history, and they make pronouncements based on misconceived notions.  They even manage to fabricate some historical events of their own.  All these faults lead Dever to categorise them as \\"nihilists\\" - a term borrowed from Nietzschian disillusionment.  More than using selected evidence, Dever charges, this group works under an ideology affecting today's international politics.<br /><br />Dever's book isn't just an academic search and destroy mission, however.  He presents a profusion of recent work in excavation, social structure and imperial politics in the region.  As part of his analysis, he wants due regard given to the \\"popular religions\\" prevalent in the time when the present Hebrew Bible was assembled.  The biblical writers, he asserts, were The Establishment - male priests and scribes with their own elite agenda.  Their purpose was the extinction of widespread \\"cults\\" adhered to by the majority population, particularly the elimination of the Ashereh cult likely prevelant among women.  Ashereh, considered by some scholars to be Yahweh's consort, certainly commanded more adherents than the monotheist propogandists.  However, this is the closest he comes to dealing with theology.<br /><br />Dever's claim that the biblical assemblers \\"knew a lot and knew it early\\" in answer to the title's query may be contested.  What cannot be challenged is his assertion that the Hebrew Bible has an historical basis.  The chronology may be suspect, as is the classical portrayal of personages such as Solomon and David.

Dever's book isn't just an academic search and destroy mission, however.  He presents a profusion of recent work in excavation, social structure and imperial politics in the region.  As part of his analysis, he wants due regard given to the \\"popular religions\\" prevalent in the time when the present Hebrew Bible was assembled.  The biblical writers, he asserts, were The Establishment - male priests and scribes with their own elite agenda.  Their purpose was the extinction of widespread \\"cults\\" adhered to by the majority population, particularly the elimination of the Ashereh cult likely prevelant among women.  Ashereh, considered by some scholars to be Yahweh's consort, certainly commanded more adherents than the monotheist propogandists.  However, this is the closest he comes to dealing with theology.    Dever's claim that the biblical assemblers \\"knew a lot and knew it early\\" in answer to the title's query may be contested.  What cannot be challenged is his assertion that the Hebrew Bible has an historical basis.  The chronology may be suspect, as is the classical portrayal of personages such as Solomon and David.

It's a plan.  It's a recipe.  It's a blueprint.  It's a code.  Ridley shows how these metaphors miss the point - they're all too fixed to compare with the dynamics of the fundamental molecule of life.  He shows how our genome, indeed, the genome common to all life, uses the same elements to say many things.  Instead of terms identifying fixed elements, he suggests the image of language.  The genome has a limited lexicon of phrases with which to build bodies and personalities, yet manages an immense variation in the results.  How like a chimpanzee are you?, he asks.  Depending on how you make the comparison - very little or very much.  If you count the entire number of \\"base pairs\\" making up chimpanzees and humans, the difference is minimal - perhaps 30 thousand out of 3 billion.  If, instead, you visit the zoo [or, better, Gombe] the differences are striking.<br /><br />In Ridley's view, the striking differences are due to \\"word order\\" contained in the genome.  All the words are essentially the same, but different locations and different interactions produce different characteristics.  Including behaviour.  In the six or seven million years since the chimpanzee-human line diverged, lifestyles, diet, social structure and living environment have helped guide how the genome produces a body and how that body will likely act in a given situation.  Environment and the genome, then, are in a constant interactive flux.  They feed signals through the organism to determine whether the organism will survive and reproduce.  Nature isn't in the driver's seat, and if we fail to learn or adapt to the vagaries of environment, we won't survive to have descendants.  Nature, then, is achieved via nurture.<br /><br />All this should seem self-evident in today's world, but Ridley shows we have yet to fully understand and accept our role in Nature.  There are few writers as articulate and expressive in dealing with these issues as Ridley.  His grasp of the science involved is firm, yet he maintains a conversational tone throughout the narrative.  While you will encounter much that is new to you in this book, you may close it [the first time], confident that his explanations have neither overwhelmed you nor left you unsatisfied.  Of course, as Ridley points out, there is much work remaining in understanding the genome's impact on life.

It was an almost iconoclastic \\"psychological\\" study, typical of the times and thus immensely popular.  It changed sharply the image of Clemens held by most Twain readers.  Which one were they reading?  Now Fred Kaplan has attempted to suture the parts and bring us a fresh picture of a whole man.  Using new material and thorough analysis, Kaplan has produced a enduring biography of America's greatest writer.  This study is comprehensive in scope and ably presented for long-time Twain aficionados.  Newcomers to Clemens' work may be staggered by the wealth of information.<br /><br />Pseudonyms were common among 19th Century journalists, Clemens' starting point in his writing career.  Kaplan demonstrates that the detachment Clemens enjoyed as a \\"reporter\\" was transformed into a strong, unified character in his later writing.  Factual works outlining his travel experiences later took second place to his fiction.  While these books still carried the \\"Twain\\" banner, Kaplan shows it as an enlargement of his image, not a branching off.  Fiction also enabled Twain to incorporate his linguistic attainments to a degree unmatched in his day.  His portrayal of Mississippi Valley patois often led to critics labeling him \\"common\\", but Kaplan counters that Twain had a more comprehensive view of his fellow Americans than did most of his contemporaries.<br /><br />Most contemporary readers of Twain were captivated by his humour, which was innovative and spirited.  Kaplan, while recognising Twain's the appeal to his audience, gives little further acknowledgement to this aspect.  Why, we wonder, did Twain, whose life was long beset by tragedies and the struggle for financial stability, continue to write with his unique form of wit.  Even the latest works Twain produced were lively presentations, often heavy with irony.  Kaplan relates this, but offers no explanation for its tenacity. Even Twain's inspired soliloquy of Belgium's King Leopold was laced with Mississippi Valley expressions.  Reading any of the writings from Twain's long career, the light touch is always present, but it seems to slip by Kaplan with but scant notice.<br /><br />Kaplan deals well, however, with Twain's serious side.  Finances, in almost overwhelming detail, dominate the book.  The problems with family - illness stalked the Clemens clan for decades - are thoroughly related.  How many of these ills might be related to their economic plight?  Twain saw firm links, described fully, but the biographer declines to judge their validity.  Kaplan is stronger in description than in analysis. While this keeps him detached, the reader is offered few insights.  No diagnosis of any of the family's illnesses intrude on the narrative.  Kaplan also follows Twain's travels in detail, but the background panorama remains subtly hidden.  A thorough knowledge of world events is a clear prerequisite for reading this life in context.  The result is a straightforward relation of Twain's life, readable, thorough in personal details, but fails to place those intimacies within a broader scene.<br /><br />The book will be welcomed by academics and those already well versed in Twain's life.  Kaplan successfully refutes the claim that Clemens and Twain were separate personas, Twain shedding the intrusions of Clemens' financial worries or family illness when taking up his pen.  Beyond that, Kaplan offers only descriptions of that background to Twain's successful writing career.  A fine book, but limited in scope.<br /><br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]uy of Belgium's King Leopold was laced with Mississippi Valley expressions.

Years of \\"mystery\\" novels have given us the image of witless, plodding, unimaginative policemen, easily bested by private detective geniuses. When we first meet Sam, he falls right into the stereotype, as well as into a gutter. He doesn't even have the sense to come in out of the rain. That's because his senses have been dulled by Old Bearhugger's - an elixir well suited to numbing the brain to life's injustices. And justice, or the lack of it, is a persistent theme in Sam's life.<br /><br />Sam's a copper. Policemen are there to enforce the law. In this case, the Patrician of Ankh Morpork has arabesqued normal law enforcement with the creation of Guilds. There's an association of thieves, of burglars, of prostitutes, even of murderers. The latter are known as Assassins - the taking of life is a gentleman's business, not something to be left to the rabble. Against all logic, the Patrician's plan works - the Guilds keep order within their own ranks. That leaves Sam with little to do - and the elixir's appeal is irresistible.<br /><br />A murder, unlike anything the Assassins might perpetrate, confronts Sam with a novel situation. Assassins, while neat, leave more than a pile of smoking ash in their wake. Nor do they leave such arcane clues as a footprint resembling a raptor's claws. A mystery, indeed. One which could lead to the City terrorized by an unprecedented threat - the arrival of a giant dragon. Neither Sam nor his boss the Patrician want the City subjected to that kind of threat. It's not controllable. It doesn't fit into the design. And it's bloody dangerous.<br /><br />In pursuing his quarry, Sam wends his way to a home for sick and abandoned dragons. Run by the city's richest . . . umm . . . woman?? If any Pratchett character evades description, it's Sybil Ramkin. We know she's rather Valkyrian, well bred, and consumed with a fervour for swamp dragons. We don't know how old she is [although her family line reaches far into the past], and although matronly in mien, she's not a widow, grass or otherwise. Vimes, a product of the City's Shades [and a few gutters], is daunted, but not overwhelmed. A relationship, however unlikely, builds.<br /><br />Pratchett draws a fine set of characters in this book. The City's Night Watch, with its cast of unlikely, but wholly believable, characters is introduced. Including a dwarf two metres tall, Carrot Ironfoundersson, who's come to the City to become a Man. Colon, \\"one of Nature's Sergeants\\". Nobby Nobbs, whose species remains uncertain. And another whose species is unquestioned, but whose fitness for the City Watch requires further scrutiny. And always, there is Vimes. Vimes, confronted by a dragon metres long and with tonnes of mass, still has an edge. The dragon wants to be king of Ankh Morpork. And Vimes' ancestor, Old Stoneface, once held similar views of justice about kings . . .<br /><br />Pratchett has a hack at a number of sound, established, institutions. His swipe at the powers of the British Trade Unions through Ankh's Guild system is classic. A traditional association, the Mechanics' Institute, is wonderfully portrayed in the workers' cabal meeting to summon the dragon. It may seem foreign or exaggerated to an American audience. Rest assured it's right on the mark. Pratchett's Patrician shows how effective and subtle the exercise of true power can be. Even in the direst circumstances, his unique personal information network works for him.<br /><br />For those who are new to Pratchett, this is a fine place to start. PTerry's descriptive wit will keep your attention. It may even grant you some new forms of language. How many of you know a runt dragon is \\"a total whittle\\"? How would you play charades with a Librarian? Why does hiring a troll for a pub change the job description from \\"bouncer\\" to \\"splatter\\"?<br /><br />For the long-term Pratchett aficionado there are new treasures to enjoy, new conceptsto prompt reflection. There are those well-versed in the Discworld Pantheon who rank the Patrician among their favourites. Others rejoice in Sam Vimes as a credibly drawn figure, worthy of imitation [if you can afford the Bear Hugger's]. The cast is impeccably drawn, the story vintage Pratchett. Whether your collection of Pratchett is accumulating randomly or in sequence, this one will fit in admirably and will suffer from being taken from the shelf repeatedly for fresh enjoyment.<br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada, March 11, 2001]Discworld Pantheon who rank the Patrician among their favourites.

Books	5	237	253	N	N	Compilation by committee	Friedman keeps to a very narrow, but clearly defined, path in assessing biblical origins. He goes to some effort to restrict his thesis to identifying authors and their likely locations. The validity of events nor theology never enter the picture. Contention over inconsistencies in what has come down to us as \\"the\\" bible have raged for centuries. Scholars in the Middle Ages, he reminds us, readily noted how styles varied, accounts were duplicated and traditions conflicted. With a keen analytical eye enhanced by long experience and good scholarship, he teases a coherent picture from this confusing collection of tales. Although not all the material here is original - and how could it be? - Friedman's assemblage is soundly researched, very ably organised and presented.<br /><br /> The fundamental issue rests on the division of the Hebrew-speaking peoples into the \\"dual kingdoms\\" of Israel and Judah. The result was the compilation of two \\"histories\\" with different styles and priorities. Each had a different focus and approach to what was meaningful. The later confusion resulted when this pair of accounts was amalgamated into a single document and promulgated as \\"the\\" book. Friedman strongly points out that this didn't invalidate the histories, it simply meant readers of it need to understand they are reading a parallel set of accounts.<br /><br /> From the outset, Friedman dismisses the traditional view of Moses' authorship. There are too many implausibilities for that to have occurred - not the least of which is the description of Moses' death. Friedman contends the books are historical accounts recorded by scribes, probably court priests, of their respective kingdoms. Their style differences allow him to pin letter designations for identification - the now well-known E, J, D and P. The first two refer to how the deity was identified. The \\"D\\" is for \\"Deuteronomist\\", identified by stylistic traits, while the \\"P\\" relates to priestly genealogies. Friedman uses various highlighting techniques to demonstrate variances in the text style or content. This rather hotch-potch arrangement was later organised into the single volume by the \\"Redactor\\" [the \\"E\\" for \\"Editor\\" having already been assigned.<br /><br /> Setting his thesis within a well-defined chronology, Friedman shows how the various authors had previously material to draw on producing their own accounts. With no possibility of retrieving the sequence, we have only the results passed down to us. This situation explains many of the inconsistencies, since Judaic scribes had different sources than those in Israel. They also, apparently, had different agendas to follow. Almost from the beginning, for example, there are differences in the roles of Moses and Aaron. Friedman lists other variations with their probable origins.<br /><br /> Friedman's book is the best current example of what has become known as the \\"Documentary Hypothesis\\". This phrase stands in contrast with the idea of \\"divine origins\\" of the collection. As examples of historical literature, the books of the Hebrew Bible merit serious investigation and analysis. Friedman, picking up from French and German studies of the past two centuries, has performed a significant task. He writes well, doesn't engage in idle speculation, and, perhaps most important, condemns none. The authors he discusses were products of their time. He recognises that, keeping the authors clearly within their contemporary context. An excellent book, worthy of anybody's attention.

If you are fluent with metaphor, as Shapiro certainly is, analyses of others' work can be scathing. In this book he surveys many ideas and thoughts on life's origins. Nearly all are lacking some facet or poorly conceived in his view. His ire is fiercely aroused over laboratory attempts to duplicate life's beginnings. Our understanding of prebiotic conditions is clearly too limited. He insisted the answer lies in Nature's processes. We don't know enough to duplicate them. Since our laboratory research has failed, he argues, we must seek answers elsewhere - off our home world.<br /><br /> As he develops his theme, Shapiro spares no effort in deriding what he deems inadequate. The prominence of any figure or idea simply crumbles under his penetrating gaze. If the work meet his qualification of &quot;extraordinary proof&quot;, he demolishes it with scornful imagery. His critiques have led his colleagues to deem him &quot;Dr No&quot; - an appellation he relishes.<br /><br /> Nor does he fail to adapt any mechanism to further his position. He even enlists biblical allegory - albeit rather twisted in his hand. Knowing the biblical myth of a &quot;creation week&quot; is outdated, he simply changes the metaphor. He crams the 12 billion year history of the Cosmos into a seven day framework. In this structure he also places two &quot;schools&quot; of ideas about life - the Christian Fundamentalists and the followers of the Anthropic Principle. The former relies on one of the multitude of &quot;Bibles&quot;. The latter accepts scientific observations of Nature, but deems the whole Cosmos is in place just for humanity. Countering this unusual mix is Shapiro's &quot;Sour Lemon School&quot; which sees life's origins as a fluke. We are likely alone in the universe, they claim, since conditions for life are too critical.<br /><br /> Understanding how life originates and evolves, he stresses, is too important to our future. Since he dismisses laboratory attempts to resolve the issue, he uses past space exploration as a foundation for a new programme. Deeming his own philosophy &quot;Cosmic Evolution&quot;, asking that a &quot;new story&quot; of life be written. The elements of the story are difficult to perceive because they're distant. Some hints are visible, which he presents in some detail. As an introduction, he describes the &quot;replication learned from clay crystals&quot; proposal of Graham Cairns Smith with slight nod of approval. Gunther Wachtershauser's life formation on pyrite crystals receives a bit more approbation. Shapiro considers it worth further investigation. Developing his plot, he then turns to meteoritic evidence for possible life, but it's Mars that seizes his attention. NASA, he argues, dismissed too readily the data indicating organic material on &quot;the Big Orange&quot;. To help him finish his &quot;new story&quot; further effort must follow.

Trips across the world, meeting new people, sharing insights and resolving mysteries of Earth's processes.  There is, of course, the downside.  Lava flows that shred boots, impossibly complex rock formations and bays that simply disappear during a seven-year interval between visits.  If you have a writing gift, as Richard Fortey does, you can impart all these aspects of the science to a wide audience.  This book does that admirably - and Fortey's not even a geologist!<br />Fortey's study of fossil trilobites has led him far afield.  Since those bizarre creatures persisted for over three hundred million years, their remains are well distributed in both time and space.  In studying them, Fortey has made the entire planet his backyard.  That intimacy and his wide vision combine to produce this matchless work.  From the opening pages he combines human history and the Earth's antics in an evocative theme.  Vesuvius, that town killer, becomes a symbol of the dynamics of the world beneath our feet.  Volcanoes also produce rich soils, luring humans up their slopes to plant crops.  That juxtaposition typifies how geology has driven human society.<br />Geology, Fortey reminds us, is a young science, as active as the world it studies.  He traces the thoughts of investigators over the past centuries.  Through that time, two aspects of the Earth's dynamics eluded them.  How fast was the planet cooling and what caused the bizarre formations they studied?  It took physics, not geology, to solve the first - radioactive elements kept the interior hot.  The second, plate tectonics, resolved most of the second.  The notion that the crust &quot;floats&quot; on a sea of magma led to better understanding of deep processes.  Plate tectonics, in Fortey's view, is the key to unlock nearly all geology's basic question.  It explains &quot;suspect terrain&quot; and anomalous mountain formation.  It also demonstrates why some areas are earthquake and volcano prone.  Charles Lyell's &quot;uniformitarianism&quot;, Fortey stresses, is basically correct.  We can't observe directly many of the forces shaping the world.<br />What shapes the world, Fortey, continues, shapes our lives as well.  How much of our history is due to Africa's pushing northward into Europe?  What forced the ancient peoples of the Western Hemisphere to create their unique societies?  Is the landscape of Southern Asia a foundation for the famous Silk Road?  Tilting landscapes give us our rivers and the communities established on their banks.  How many times has the Mississippi drowned towns, or abandoned them to isolation?  Fortey keeps us aware of how our existence is shaped by the rocks beneath us.<br />With sets of stunning colour photographs and drawings to enhance the finely crafted text, this book's worthy of your attention.

In North America, the finding of a set of finely hewn stone points established a new creation myth - the Clovis People. Clovis Points are unique to the Western Hemisphere - indeed, unique to North America. Their discovery created a dogma of origins with the story locked in time and place. The Americas, it was declared, were founded by Asian peoples skirting the last glaciers beginning their own withdrawal north - about 11 000 years ago. The dating and the path were thus inexorably set in the minds of scholars and the citizenry alike. Tom Dillehay wants to overthrow that dogma. He presents several challenges to long-held concepts, supporting his contentions with detailed information on recent finds and analysis. And all the information arises from an unsuspected source - South America.<br /><br /> Although Dillehay is hesitant to condemn North American archaeologists for their studied avoidance of South American possibilities, the inference is clear. Northern, mostly white, Protestant archaeologists left unacknowledged the work of their Catholic, Indo-Spanish colleagues digging in the other half of the hemisphere. Dillehay, breaking into that unexplored territory, encountered another unique find. At Monte Verde, he unearthed the remains of a prehistoric camp. The moist conditions of the site, almost unknown in North American locations, preserved skins, wood, even rope. These artefacts also pushed back the settlement of the Western Hemisphere some 1500 years.<br /><br /> The Clovis mythology contained more than timing. A lifestyle was deduced as well. The finely hewed points suggested a hunting people - moving and breeding rapidly. It was calculated they filled the hemisphere in but one millennium. Dillehay and his South American colleagues demonstrated that this scenario is highly unlikely. The settlers left too much evidence of opportunistic hunting, mixed with a well-established vegetable diet. The sites also long-term residency in rock shelters and built-up structures. The pre-Clovis people may have been mobile, but the mobility was likely seasonal with plant fruition, not the following of migratory animals.<br /><br /> Although Dillehay asserts scientists are accepting the notion of pre-Clovis Americans, he concedes some critics remain strenuously vocal. Most of the objections now fall into the &quot;contaminated dating&quot; theme - the radiocarbon samples were corrupted by introduced material. Dillehay simply counters that after a generation of collecting, such objections are demonstrably spurious. There are simply too many supportive cases verifying his contentions. He lists and describes many of these, even adding a chart of all the samples taken up to the time of publication. Many ideas, including some current legal ones, will have to be reconsidered. For the issue isn't purely academic.

Most of the objections now fall into the &quot;contaminated dating&quot; theme - the radiocarbon samples were corrupted by introduced material. Dillehay simply counters that after a generation of collecting, such objections are demonstrably spurious. There are simply too many supportive cases verifying his contentions.

By gathering reams of supporting material, using every possible example, all while reproaching your critics, lets you can produce a book such as this one. Conway Morris has a deserved reputation as a fine palaeontologist. Working with early fossils has given him a firm foundation to address how life has evolved on this planet. In this book he builds on that basis to take an additional step. Is human intelligence unique, or will we someday encounter it on distant worlds? What do we know about early [and present] life on this planet that would enable us to forecast what might be found elsewhere? Conway Morris addresses these and other questions directly, using an abundance of supportive evidence.<br /><br /> He starts with deepest chronological base, the formation of stars and planets. Even at this level, he stresses, there are constraints. Stars have sequential mechanisms, now fairly well defined. Following them, planets' structures and even orbits may follow almost predictable pathways. After the earliest emergence of life, rules of form, options of habitat and, ultimately, the way intellect occurs, may be broadly set and followed. Darwin understood this from the beginning - evolution builds on what's gone before. Even the most bizarre-looking sea or land life has resulted from a series of steps reaching into the past.<br /><br /> The body of the book portrays those steps, where identifiable in the past and as seen today. The steps, as Conway Morris rightly reminds us, are the results of adaptations through time - which he defines as &quot;inherency&quot;. He bristles with indignation at the critics of the adaptationist programme who contend if you can't identify the &quot;usefulness&quot; of a trait, it's not an adaptation. Just because we are ignorant of a function doesn't mean there is none. Since evolution works on all parts of an organism, even if unequally in time or location, all evolutionary steps are adaptations. To Conway Morris, the frequent appearance of similar adaptations - &quot;convergences&quot; - in varying environments indicates that life operates under some general orders - it's not &quot;rule by roulette&quot;. Among is many examples is the bizarre similarity in brain structure between human beings and mormyid fish. The latter is a creature living within an intense electrical environment. With high demand on its cognitive functions, the mormyid's brain uses about half the body's oxygen supply - three times that of the average human.<br /><br /> After fashioning his thematic structure with lavish amounts of material, Conway Morris nearly demolishes the edifice in explaining why he's constructed it. In a final, rambling chapter, he lays out the plans for the building. Most of it lashes out at things he deplores, including amazingly, &quot;ultra-Darwinism&quot;, that catch-all phrase his target Gould used so ineptly. According to Conway Morris, something - not a deity, not &quot;just six numbers&quot;, not anything even definable - but something is &quot;out there&quot; guiding everything from the construction of stars to evolving apes who can write sonnets. Much of this foundation is based on the thoughts of a few other writers, mostly philosophers. Here, Conway Morris exhibits a form of colour aberration - instead of using John Greene, he would better have chosen John Grey. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]evolutionary steps are adaptations.

While the 1960's - the &quot;Nixon Era&quot; as Oppenheimer labels it, is usually portrayed with anti-war protests, the &quot;drug culture&quot; and alternate lifestyles, the author discerned another aspect. In this compelling analysis, the activities of American religions are brought to light. The author selected the five major faiths to examine whether the :counterculture&quot; of the sixties had an impact. In what sense, he asks, were these religions modified and how meaningful were the changes? What were the changes proposed and how did these faiths respond to them? The answers are surprising.<br /><br /> Churches are a major factor in United States society. Oppenheimer begins with some interesting numbers of church membership. He also describes the differences across the various faiths - his description of the history and development of the Southern Baptists is particularly enlightening. He portrays how elements of the counterculture forced the faiths to reassess their outlook of community relations. Every organised religion contains its conservative and reform elements. Oppenheimer describes the reform challenges to the Unitarians, Roman Catholics, Jews, Episcopalians and Southern Baptists. Each religion faced particular provocations to its established norm. Each resolved these movements in a different way. He demonstrates, for example, how Roman Catholics had an impetus for change from Vatican II, with unexpected results. Gay rights, feminism and new religious communities become significant issues. Only among the Southern Baptists was Viet Nam the topic of dispute, and Oppenheimer's description of the methods employed makes compelling reading. Still, he concludes the foundation of the counterculture's impact on United States' religions lies elsewhere, as he points out in his conclusion.<br /><br /> The author has combined some in-depth research with interviews of the participants, newspaper and magazine stories to fully personalise this account. Amazingly, no mention is made of the song of the title! Photographs of events and some of the leading figures add some nuance, but aren't very informative. Written in an almost rollicking style, the book is well drafted for the general reader. It should inform many on why their particular faith is operating as it is today.

Media often lacks understanding of the role of research.  Worse, journalists are usually working to an agenda.  Amy Marcus glaringly falls into both these categories.  The result is a book that starts with a vista and concludes with a vision - one that's seriously flawed.  Marcus spends the book running the Red Queen's Race - running as fast as you can to stay in the same place.  Her quest is a struggle to keep abreast of the fast-moving science of archaeology in its most tumultuous arena, the land of Canaan.  We must admire her ambition to come to grips with a difficult topic, but this book would have been better conceived if Marcus had been a co-author or ghost writer with someone knowledgeable.  Instead, she relies on a few publications and a trove of personal interviews, of which we read but snippets.<br />Marcus, rightly assuming her readership likely has a broad concept of Biblical stories, but lacks detailed knowledge, summarises certain legends from The Book.  She then introduces us to the diggers, their sites and their analyses of the data.  We are given snippets of personal observation along with scientific assessment.  Mt Nebo, from which Moses was to have observed the Promised Land, has been subject to excavations for over sixty years.  What has been learned, that the ancient societies of Palestine were dynamic and mixed, sets the tone for the remainder of the book.<br />The issue addressed is the roots of the modern societies of Palestine-Israel.  Situated on major trade and empire-building routes, calling the history of this region &quot;dynamic&quot; is merely a starting point.  Until recently, only two books constituted source material for how these dynamics developed - the Hebrew Bible and Josephus' History.  Neither, it turns out, can be relied upon.  Modern archaeology, as Marcus goes to some effort to relate, has overthrown millennia of legend and myth.  Her point is that modern propaganda has little foundation on which to rest.  Israel, an artificial nation derived from the shattered British Empire, has long substantiated its claims over Palestinians on the fable that it is comprised of a unique people, specially established by divine fiat.  Marcus uses the finds of archaeologists to point out the Jews are but one among many with deep roots in the area.  Their &quot;unique&quot; status fails under the scrutiny of newly revealed data.<br />Marcus traveled the area, reading and interviewing the researchers delving into Palestine's past.  The Jews and the Palestinians share a common Canaanite ancestry.  Their beliefs and practices share a mutual foundation, she asserts.  The evidence is in scrolls, clay tablets and architecture.  Israel's former glories are manufactured through a series of writings designed to unite the separated nations of Israel and Judah.  In revealing these recent disclosures, Marcus speaks with various scholars, attends conferences and assesses the information they present.  Challengers of traditional views are almost universally labelled &quot;controversial&quot; or &quot;brash&quot; or other pejorative phrases.  Traditionalists fare little better, but we're left with the feeling that everybody has an agenda.  Still, she argues that the revelations of their efforts should &quot;reshape the Middle East&quot;.<br />In making this claim, Marcus mercifully ignores the force of theology in driving human passions.  There is little mention of divinities in this work, or the hold they have on human thinking.  Her approach is purely historical, which is apt in challenging the sources guiding opinion.  How the populace can be brought to a fresh understanding of its roots, Marcus studiously avoids.  The role of education is ignored, a strange omission in a book that purports to be a guiding light for change.  Her stress on politics leaves the validity of the science and the depth of popular conviction obscured.  Reliance on tradition, however falselybased, will overcome whatever archaeology reveals until a populace understands its weaknesses.  Only immense political will can achieve her desired theme.<br />Part of the failure to attain that will is found in Marcus' presentation of the science involved.  She spends much effort in describing debates and the debaters, wholly ignoring the fact that the politicians select the portions they can use while ignoring the remainder.  In her hands, archaeology remains a political tool instead of a scientific icon.  Attempting to bring contending factions to negotiations founded on real science is admirable, but Marcus is addressing the wrong audience.<br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]y based, will overcome whatever archaeology reveals until a populace understands its weaknesses.

New discoveries, fresh insights, novel concepts emerge with almost dizzying frequency.  Science is supposed to work on hypothesis testing - evidence confirms or refutes ideas.  To discover that entrenched dogmas have been established, battlelines drawn and still contested, careers launched and destroyed is disheartening.  To realise that the issue centres on a few stone tools renders the situation almost ludicrous - until we remember archaeology is the study of humanity.  And humans, as Adovisio points out vividly, can cling tenaciously to favoured ideas - particularly those concerning humanity.<br />Adovasio briefly relates the African origins and distribution of humanity across the globe. However, this story truly starts with the 1937 discovery of some finely crafted stone spearpoints in New Mexico.  Debate over Indians as &quot;noble savage&quot; or &quot;barbarous native&quot; was sharply interrupted by this find.  The workmanship and novel design of the &quot;Clovis Points&quot; demanded reconsideration of Native Americans - particularly of their origins and dispersal in the Western Hemisphere.  Knowledge of the extent of the massive glaciers covering North American many millennia ago left but a small time window for Asian peoples to cross the Bering land bridge exposed during the glacial period.  Who were these people? Adovasio asks.  When did they arrive?  How long did it take them to inhabit the hemisphere?  What was their environmental impact?<br />All these questions have been asked for many years.  Adovasio's own research made a significant contribution when he excavated a rockshelter at Meadowcroft, Pennsylvania.  Artefacts there were dated to a time far earlier than the Last Glacial Maximum [LGM] of just over eleven thousand years ago.  Other sites, most notably the Monte Verde site in Chile have added data positing an earlier emigration from the Old World to the New.  All this new information has challenged the dogma of &quot;Clovis&quot; being the &quot;earliest Americans&quot;.  It's not just an academic debate, Adovasio points out.  Questions of site selection, investigation, testing procedures, retention of artefacts and human remains have all be raised.  Indeed, with the Native American Graves Protection and Preservation Act [NAGPRA] some of these issues have been enshrined in law.  He examines all the issues in exquisite detail, readily dismissing the more bizarre, such as the contention that the Western Hemisphere is the cradle of all humanity.  Data must not only support or demolish dogma, it must support or demolish poorly conceived law.<br />Adovasio's narrative becomes vigorously polemical at times.  His stridency is forgiven when you recall he's spent three decades of defenders of the Clovis Bar shutting their minds to evidence - his and that of others.  Although this is hardly an academic study, his assemblage of evidence and logic underpinning his assertions is a standard that any researcher would do well to review.  He gives Paul Martin's &quot;Pleistocene blitzkrieg&quot; of the new human arrivals a thorough airing, but rejects it.  In Adovasio's view, it was the climate or disease that drove the large fauna extinct, not human hunting.  He examines a wide variety of emigration scenarios, including the &quot;coastal enclave&quot; idea, in explaining how this Hemisphere was populated.  He admits defeat in selecting any one, but declares the first humans arrived here before the LGM.  Only from that basis, he argues, can we establish not only when humans occupied this region, but how.<br /><br />This book is both a scholarly and entertaining read.  Adovasio builds his case well, even adding cartoons to his collection of photographs and diagrams.  Instead of footnotes, he provides per-chapter references, a nuisance to the novice in this topic.

With enough variety to suit nearly every taste, some are clearly more desirable due to focus.  In this issue, &quot;This Overheating World&quot; is a topic needing further coverage and attention.  Of the fourteen items assembled, half are devoted to climate change, its impact and our response to it.  All are well written and worthy of close attention.  The other essays are more varied, but nearly as important.  Although there are some contentious issues under scrutiny here, the topics are, for some, an introduction needing further notice.<br />Bill McKibben opens this issue with an analysis of why Americans seem bent on ignoring the climate change going on around us.  He recapitulates the research that has gone into revealing the evidence of climate change, such as ice, tree and sediment cores.  He thinks enough data has been accumulated and presented to the public to cause some shift in thinking and behaviour.  Little, if any, of that has been achieved.  He calls for an &quot;Orwell&quot; or a &quot;Thoreau&quot; to produce a book or film that will awaken the public to the hazard.  His admission that his own book failed in this regard makes sad reading.<br />Following essays by Maarten t' Hart, Philip Marsden, Matthew Hart and Mark Lynas recount local manifestations of the climate change phenomena.  Mighty dust storms, loss of water supplies and reduced rainfall are having significant impact on the lives of many people.  How those people will react and whether the rest of the world will be dealing with their fate remain questions still unasked.  Solutions aren't even being debated at this point.<br />&quot;This Overheating World&quot; is occurring in the political world, as well.  Three essays on the American crusade in Iraq and its results conclude the book.  In a poignant account, Huha al-Radi describes her return to Baghdad to assist her family in recovery from the invasion.  Spending less than a month with her mother and their orchards.  In a daily diary, she records how nature and the invaders have acted to spoil her crop and her family's livelihood.  As a human account of the misery still being inflicted on Iraq, it makes disturbing reading.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]r mother and their orchards.

Works on Newton aren't as common as might be expected. The task of addressing such a monumental mentality is formidable, to say the least. Only the most ambitious or analytical could attempt it. Gleick's effort encompasses the major facets of Newton's life, including his academic, political and religious aspects. He avoids the modern approach of delving into Newton's psyche or recapitulating three centuries of scholarly disputation. Even the &quot;falling apple&quot; story is redrawn as Newton's realisation that apparent size compared with distance expressed a relationship needing explanation. The result is a clean, unobstructed view of a complex man - and his legacy.<br />From meagre beginnings Newton carved an expansive niche in European scholarship. His skills, noted early, brought him a Cambridge appointment at 27. Already showing great promise, he was a reluctant publisher. He sequestered himself in his rooms, later in a small cottage. He'd lived almost alone during his childhood, but his curiosity led him in many directions. The prism experiments, breaking sunlight with a prism, began his long career in what is now deemed &quot;physics&quot;. Light's properties were the subject of great dispute, with Newton holding to emitted particles. Waves seemed to adhere to the Cartesian &quot;vortices&quot; which Newton found suspect. Playing with mirrors and lenses led to the reflecting telescope widely used today. Thinking about the heavenly bodies he observed led, of course, to his idea of gravitational attraction. Not a popular idea then, since such forces were disdained.<br />It's difficult to assess whether his delving into the facts of nature led to his personal isolation, or the reverse holds. Gleick shows how Newton focussed on problems with an intensity few have demonstrated. Even in employment as Warden of the Mint, Newton pursued counterfeiters with a Rambo-like dedication - even accompanying culprits to the gallows. His brief stint as a Member of Parliament, however, was virtually silent. He was perturbed by his developing scepticism of the Holy Trinity - this while teaching at the College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Cambridge University. These thoughts, too, he kept closely concealed. Only the dispute over gravity with Robert Hooke brought him reluctantly forth.<br />Although Newton's accomplishments were vast, Gleick relates how the great thinker understood he was only uncovering beginnings. Even those beginnings, however, were deemed &quot;mechanistic&quot; by the later Romantics - a label applied to science even today. Gleick rebuts this hostile view in his conclusion. However Newton's personality is viewed, his accomplishments readily surpass puerile complaints. Without him, Gleick reminds us, much of today's world would not exist. Cassini would not be orbiting Saturn, returning its amazing images to us, without him.<br />This book isn't highly detailed, and that's right and proper. Massive volumes of Newton's life already exist. Gleick has provided a tasteful and effective teaser for those wishing to learn more of this amazing man. He's even provided images of some of Newton's notes and observations imparting the flavour of Newton's thinking. Start here, you will not be disappointed.

The public is being subjected to a litany of accounts of how life can, and has been,  eliminated en masse.  After learning ice ages may have swept away numerous creatures, we discovered dinosaurs may have been wiped out by the Big Rock.  While trying to comprehend the amount of life an asteroid can dispose of, Michael Benton demonstrates the numbers pale in comparison to what a Big Burp can achieve.  Combining his own field work with the research from numerous others, Benton skilfully builds a scenario of real mass destruction.  His fine prose style keeps this book a compelling read throughout.<br />Sharply criticising Darwin's contemporaries and successors for clinging too resolutely to the notion that Nature's forces merely creep along, Benton notes the persistence of one theme.  The &quot;uniformitarians&quot;, he says, blinded scholars to the evidence - evidence that suggested life could end suddenly.  Charles Lyell, one of Charles Darwin's inspirations, argued that what is seen today typifies the entire, and lengthy, history of our world.  Slow, gradual change on today's surface is but the most recent example of the panorama of millions of years.  Sudden change, &quot;catastrophism&quot;, promoted by Baron Cuvier in France, was false.  In life, Darwin's evolution by natural selection reflected the gradualist theme.<br />Benton dismisses Lyell and his adherents as overcommitted to gradualism.  He  contends they shut their eyes to contrary evidence.  He admits the data was less than readily apparent, but argues some questions should have been raised long before now.  New research, sometimes in places already once observed, finally brought reassessment.  The Ural Mountains in Russia offered the first clues.  Roderick Murchison toured there in the 1840s, naming the &quot;Permian System&quot; of rocks.  Wars and revolutions interrupted the surveys and geologists and paleontologists peered at new ground.  The Great Karoo of South Africa, China and other sites provided new information.  A gradually emerging picture revealed a massive die-off 251 million years ago.  What had happened?<br />After a long introduction of chapters recounting the researchers and their findings around the planet, Benton dismisses the notion of a bolide impact.  This idea, fostered by the discovery that the Dinosaur Era had likely been concluded by the impact of a 10 kilometre asteroid, wasn't matched by the evidence.  While the Permian Extinction may have been accompanied by darkened skies and deluges of rain, the real killer was something else.  The dinosaur extinction wasn't typified by massive intrusions of poisonous gases, but the Permian was another matter.  Benton surmises that 251 million years ago a series of volcanic fissures spewed immense waves of lava over the land near the North Pole.  This area, now known as Siberia, is still covered by the remnants of the outburst.  With the lava came noxious gas, mostly carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide.  These &quot;greenhouse&quot; gases warmed the seas, releasing life-killing methane.  The catastrophe may have killed off up to 96% of all living things.<br />This is not simply an arcane analysis of events in the ancient past. It's a book that should gain a wide readership, since the events of all those millions of years ago have implications for today.  Benton notes the sediments at the bottom of our seas contain a build-up of methane equalling or exceeding that of the Permian.  Today's human-spurred global warming may be leading to the same scenario.  Extinction, Benton reminds us, isn't limited to dinosaurs or other ancient life.  It is clear that we must learn how these mechanisms work to make rational decisions about our dealings with the biosphere.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]ded new information.

Benton notes the sediments at the bottom of our seas contain a build-up of methane equalling or exceeding that of the Permian.  Today's human-spurred global warming may be leading to the same scenario.  Extinction, Benton reminds us, isn't limited to dinosaurs or other ancient life.  It is clear that we must learn how these mechanisms work to make rational decisions about our dealings with the biosphere.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]	2004-07-12

There, the casualities weren't a reticent Copernicus or a timorous Galileo, but uncountable thousands of innocent schoolchildren.  In that nation, supposedly founded on the separation of religion and the secular, the battleground shifted.  Instead of the contestants clashing in academic debating rooms, the confrontations occured in lawcourts.  Larson offers the first comprehensive survey of Christian forays into public education in the United States, and the legal disputes that ensued.  He does it with a sense of detachment not easily attained in dealing with this topic.<br />Larson outlines the background to American forms of Christianity [which have few counterparts elsewhere], before homing in on the 1925 landmark trial in Dayton, Tennessee.  Although &quot;fundamentalism&quot; may have germinated early in the 19th Century, it was the post WWI years that brought fruition and gave it voice, according to Larson.  The voice came to be centred in the three-time Presidential candidate, William Jennings Bryan.  Although a &quot;reformer&quot; with many causes, it is his role as an anti-Darwinist that captured enduring attention.  A &quot;Biblical literalist&quot;, Bryan found all social values stemming from &quot;the Bible&quot;.  As a fundamentalist champion, once he overcame an initial reluctance, he endorsed state legistlation banning Darwin from the classroom.<br />The famous &quot;Scopes trial&quot; set in motion a sequence of enactments in various States, not all Southron ones, to prevent Darwin's Idea from polluting young minds.  Many of these laws were sketchily enforced, but their very existence led to a wave of self-censorship among text-book publishers.  It isn't necessary to ban what isn't there, as Larson makes clear.  Two generations of children passed through school without learning how life works.<br />An unexpected trigger led to a fresh wave of challenges to the vacuities of science teaching in the United States.  Larson cites the Soviet Union's launching of a silvery sphere in orbit around the planet as prompting a new outlook.  Cries of betrayal led to sharp looks at how science was considered in American schools.  Among the topics, of course, evolution was given fresh attention.  With many States banning or eroding the topic, a fresh wave of court cases resulted.  However, State control of education was a given - how then to proceed against restricted curricula?<br />It was also a given that religion and government remain apart.  Challenges to the new legislation focused on The Establishment clause of the constitution which prohibited laws favouring religion.  Since evolution was forbidden, what to teach inevitably meant reverting to biblical texts.  Various laws were successfully overturned as promoting religion in public schools.  Larson takes us carefully through the various cases, particularly the 1981 Arkansas &quot;McLean&quot; decision.  For the first time, expert witnesses were allowed to cinch the case for evolution.  This decision, and a succeeding one in Louisiana, seemed to some to have finished the disputations.  Enter the ICR and a new Christian wave eroding Darwin's insight.<br />Larson describes Henry Morris' Institution for Creation Research as a prime mover in launching the new challenges to reason.  Although Morris was a key figure, Larson, keeping with his legalist theme, brings lawyer Phillip Johnson's &quot;Darwin On Trial&quot; to front stage.  Johnson's books, which have been described as Christian &quot;legal briefs&quot;, express a dichotomy: life is either spiritual or material.  He opts for spiritual, condemning evolution as &quot;athiestic&quot; and lacking morals.  Johnson is joined by Michael Behe's &quot;intelligent design&quot; movement that is now struggling for recognition.  Aspects of life, Behe argues, is too complex to have emerged without a &quot;guiding hand&quot;.  Larson depicts this without judgmental asides, leaving the reader to form their own conclusions.<br />This book is the result of painstaking research, ably presenting a wealth of complex issues.  Legal disputes rarely permit frivolous narrative, but Larson's book offers clarity and succinctness.  A text that might have been horribly ponderous, given the legalist basis, proves a delight to read.  He's to be congratulated for taking up this theme and how well he describes events and the people involved.  The book will remain a fundamental resource for any future studies and should be read by a wide audience. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]quot;.

Mark Lynas makes up for that oversight in this vividly presented account. As a journalist, he's unconstrained by the limitations of long-term data sets, political reaction to his personal findings or peer group pressure. He travels the globe, even to the point of last minute flight bookings, to observe conditions. His approach is to confront people and ask about their experiences with changing weather over the years. The method is direct, straightforward and revealing. What it demonstrates is more than startling, it's devastating.<br />While the scientists debate the temperature rise rate or the intensity of this or that storm, around the planet people are living through the conditions of warming climate. Tuvalu residents, on their miniscule island chain in mid-Pacific, are watching the land wash away. It isn't just that melting ice caps are raising sea levels and ruining crops. There are more frequent and more devastating storms occuring. In China, land is also moving, but the reason is the opposite - the rains have ceased and the land is dried and blowing away in fierce desert winds. The account of a lone woman, the last survivor of a village overwhelmed by drought, is more poignant [to me] than anything found in fiction. And the number of such stories is growing.<br />If a most gripping part of this book must be chosen, it is Lynas' tour of Peru and the Cordillera Blanca glaciers. His father, a geologist, had visited the area three decades before, camera in hand. Huge glaciers, akin to frozen waterfalls, fill the images. With those photos in his knapsack, Lynas trudges up the slopes, racked by Alititude Sickness, to record any changes. His expression at the sight cannot be repeated here, a signal of his shock - and ours at his comparative photographs. The glaciers are gone! Lynas takes us through a litany of rivers of ice that are withdrawing from long established limits. The withdrawal has a dual results - not enough snow is feeding their growth, and the meltwater is no longer available to nourish human populations. He asks: what will the citizens of Lima do when there is no more water to drink? Lynas avoids prediction of furture El Ninos' impact on these conditions. He's hardly blameable for that. Some observations on North America's depletion of the Ogalalla Aquifer, only partly attributable to overuse of fossil fuels, however, would have been useful.<br />It is fossil fuel consumption that stands charged, indeed declared guilty by Lynas, as the culprit in these events. The tumultuous clouds of auto exhausts are the major source of gases rising into our atmosphere, choking off proper heat exchange mechanisms. The contributions of the oil industry to politicians short circuits any political action to curb these emmissions. Hence, Tuvalu is being swept away, China is choking with dust and Lima, Peru will soon be seeking homes for its million citizens. But the United States, the world's greatest and most persistent polluter, decrys or subverts all efforts to quell the output of their millions of vehicles, while assiduously searching for more to burn.<br />Lynas is unequivical in his denunciations. At the same time, he invokes response from his readers to take action. Pollution increases can be curbed, he argues in his conclusion. It is you who must take the first steps. America, he stresses, must follow the lead of the European Union. Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is the first step - a committment to stop, then reduce emissions. &quot;Contraction and convergence&quot; policies must be implemented as a means of reducing emissions with a minimal impact on economies. The quest for new supplies of fossil fuels must cease and the funds used to promote alternative energy sources. Individual actions, amazingly easy small steps, must be taken and imparting to others the need follow your example spreads the message. &quot;Don'tbe scared to speak out!&quot;, he warns. Who should read his warning message? Anyone who breathes - and wishes to continue breathing. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]be scared to speak out!&quot;, he warns.

Gould, one of the worst in this regard, set a tone of erosion of natural selection with &quot;punk eek&quot; or &quot;evolution by jerks.&quot;  Sober and Wilson, less original than Gould, have attempted to resurrect a long-outdated thesis with this work.  As they candidly admit in their Introduction, &quot;group selection&quot; as an evolutionary mechanism, was declared moribund over thirty years ago.  However, the remainder of the book is an attempt to revive the corpse.  In their view, &quot;altruism&quot;, although poorly defined by the authors, shifts natural selection from Darwin's original premise, to group interaction leading to optimal survival.  It's a feeble effort, self-refuted on nearly every page.<br />Sober and Wilson offer two major themes: &quot;Evolutionary Altruism&quot; and &quot;Psychological Altruism&quot;.  The first part nods to the critics of group selection with some deftly selected quotes made to appear as if surrendering to the notion after all.  This is a creationist ploy unexpected in a book purporting to be a serious scientific presentation.  The authors attempt to temper the old view of group selection with what they term &quot;multilevel selection theory&quot; which they claim offers &quot;new insights&quot;.  These insights remain vague or missing altogether.  Relying on human-based premises makes it immediately suspect.  Using our societal standards to explain the behaviour of insects is not insight - it's misapplication of biology.<br />The second part, by its very title, shifts the focus to humans alone.  Psychology of the remainder of the animal kingdom has so far eluded study.  The authors focus on the contrast between &quot;hedonism&quot; and &quot;altruism.&quot;  These would appear self-explanatory, but in the hands of the authors, you are left in great doubt about their intent.  Biologically, they concede these are not absolutes.  Hence, we are given thoughts on &quot;desires&quot;, &quot;thoughts&quot; and &quot;beliefs&quot; which fail to assemble into anything coherent.<br />Altruism bothered Darwin.  In a world of individual &quot;fitness&quot; within an environment, survival and reproduction seemed the sole driving forces.  Although &quot;survival&quot; has taken on a wider definition than in Darwin's day, Sober and Wilson seem to have missed the news.  They even go so far as to categorise Darwin as &quot;the first group selectionist&quot;!  Although the authors confront the reader with ponderous chapter titles [&quot;Motives As Proximate Mechanisms&quot;], appearing to have deep insights, a moment's reflection would have demonstrated to the authors that their thesis is untenable.  No matter how much it bothered Darwin himself, altruism isn't fundamental to evolution's process.  Their repeated example, the brain worm, is a prime example instead of kin selection which gives the appearance of altruism [the brain worm sibling group sacrifices one of their number that the remainder can propagate.  They are 75% genetically the same].<br />What is most disturbing about this book is using our species to assess all life.  If altruism is an evolutionary issue, why do the authors frame their concept on the human condition?  They reveal their secret toward the end of the book in discussing &quot;morality&quot;.  Sober and Wilson struggle to place &quot;morality&quot; as an issue standing apart from natural selection, yet disclose it lies at the foundation of their presentation.  There are many good questions offered for thought in this book, but no valid conclusions to adhere to.

According to Crease, the revelations of science in the 18th and 19th Centuries led the Romanticists to claim nature's wonders had been diluted or destroyed by the &quot;mechanics&quot;.  He refutes those assertions with an expressive study of ten &quot;beautiful&quot; experiments.  Crease isn't arguing for a redefinition of &quot;beauty&quot; in this book.  On the contrary, he shows how beauty's normally accepted role in human life can be suitably applied to science's accomplishments.<br />He admits outright to his own surprise at a researcher's exclamation over a &quot;beautiful&quot; experiment.  The novelty of the assertion led him to query many scientists on which experiments might be so considered.  The responses both surprised and gratified him.  The result of his survey is this excellent book.  The ten selected range from the means to first measure the earth to the realization that electrons can be in two places at once.  A combination of good science and fine writing, coupled with an astute historical sense make this book a treasure.<br />What makes an experiment &quot;beautiful&quot;?  Crease sets three criteria: depth, efficiency and definitiveness.  &quot;Depth&quot; implies something fundamental about the world is revealed by the experiment.  Certainly, measuring the globe using shadows in sunlight qualifies that criterion.  &quot;Efficiency&quot; means the result is general enough to preclude having to do the experiment in a different manner to gain the same results.  &quot;Definitiveness&quot; suggests that anyone can understand both the experiment and its value.  Clearly, his ten choices show how these criteria work.  Following the descriptive essay, Crease then explains the &quot;beauty&quot; aspect of it in the appropriate scenario, whether music, graphic art or theatre.<br />Of the ten, the two of the title are symbolic: Newton's breakdown and recombination of sunlight with prisms and Foucault's use of a pendulum to verify the Earth's rotation.  Newton's demonstration has probably been castigated by the humanities more than anything else in science.  &quot;Unweaving the Rainbow&quot; was the causus belli of the Victorian Romanticists their assault on science.  Crease readily dismisses such obscurantism in explaining how valuable an exercise Newton's analysis of light proved.  By extending the experiment from breaking down light to recombining it, Newton showed how research, like creating a painting, must reach beyond first results.  There is, Crease notes, even a moral lesson in the exercise.<br />Foucault's pendulum conveys a reality about our world we cannot perceive otherwise.  Awed by the realization that only our planet's rotation can force the pendulum to describe a circle while swaying from its mount, Crease applauds the teachers who bring their students to observe it.  The experience is so profound, Crease describes it as a manifestation of &quot;sublime beauty&quot;.  It is clearly an experiment beyond an exercise in either pure mechanics or reasoning.  Seeing the swinging orb successively tumbling a set of pegs forces a reconsideration of how we perceive the universe.  What else, he asks, might greater perception have in store?  This book challenges all who feel their perception of either science or beauty is complete.  It is a worthwhile read for anyone asking, at any level, about the world they inhabit.

If you are among those still arguing the &quot;nature versus nurture&quot; debate has been resolved, visit an English Lit class.  The humanities continue skirting the notion that genes play a role in our mental life.  It challenges our ideal of &quot;free will&quot;.  Marcus, in this matchless survey, argues that &quot;what's good for the body is good for the mind&quot;.  And few dispute that genes build bodies.  The mind, like the body, has deep evolutionary roots.  Even the simple organisms inhabiting the planet with us today show how brains develop.  Increased complexity of body is reflected in brain structure.  And the mind, he reminds us, resides in the brain.<br />Marcus explains his notion with a wealth of research, most of it very recent.  He explains how similar our brain structure is to that of other animals and what that implies for behaviour.  The mechanism of building brains is common to all animal life, even when the final product varies.  Genes transmit signals - &quot;recipes&quot; - of structure and function for all parts of the body.  Brains, he continually reminds us, are not that different from livers.  Neurons proceed from points of origin, finding appropriate areas to reside and assume functional duties.  From origin to operation they show flexibility and adaptability.  In this, Marcus argues, it's clear the brain is no different than any other organ.<br />It is our brain's interaction with the rest of the body that sets us somewhat apart from the other animals.  Language, the element we hold so dear in protecting our unique status, is given a thorough examination in this book.  There are no &quot;language genes&quot;, Marcus stresses, but there are identified genes, notably FOXP2, known to impact speech ability.  He explains that looking for &quot;genes for&quot; something is futile.  Genes interact in too convoluted a manner to expect simple associations between a few nucleotides and something as complicated as speech.<br />Marcus offers a novel term to counter those railing against the strawman &quot;genetic determinism&quot;.  Having explained how evolution has led to building brains, he declares them &quot;prewired&quot; but not &quot;hardwired&quot;.  &quot;Prewired&quot; means that basic functions are spelled out biologically, but don't limit our interaction with our environments.  All brains permit flexibility by neurons interacting with each other as conditions vary.  We can learn because we are prewired to learn.  However, we've only begun the research where our brains are concerned.<br />Marcus presents this trove of information with amazing clarity.  His topics aren't simple mechanisms or ideas, yet he conveys it all with graceful logic.  He avoids &quot;dumbing down&quot; the science, yet nothing is lost in his presentation.  His theme and supporting examples, buttressed by a glossary and extensive bibliography, are expressed in delightfully accessible prose.  Some explanatory graphics depict various elements and mechanisms in furthering the reader's understanding.  The underlying concept is &quot;universality&quot; and it's easy to see how his ideas apply to all animal life.<br />This is a valuable book, easily absorbed by students, professionals in many fields, including, in the final chapter, lawyers.  The general public should be the primary market for this book since Marcus makes clear what has been learned may be applied in various ways, from &quot;gene therapy&quot; to &quot;designer children&quot;.  He doesn't avoid the hard issues in showing how recent science has closed off many myths while opening as many new options.  Further research is needed, he argues, to avoid foolish mistakes.

When the case occurs three centuries in the past, prosecuting it would seem unspeakably difficult.  However, modern forensic techniques can overcome the ravages of time, as the authors demonstrate.  When the victim is one of the giants of his times, the effort almost seems worthy of investigation.  Whether their case is proven, however, remains questionable.<br />The authors of this book take painstaking care to weave a plausible plot for the unusual death of Tycho Brahe in 1601.  Brahe was the first serious observational astronomer in Europe.  A devoted empiricist, he took nothing from past &quot;authorities&quot;.  Only &quot;seeing it for himself&quot; satisfied his need to unravel the mysteries of the heavens.  Brahe's abilities and forceful personality brought him wide acclaim.  It also brought him the most famous observatories in European history - Uraniborg Castle in Denmark and Benatky near Prague.  In line with these fabulous sites, Brahe constructed massive instruments to enable him to make the most precise measurements of the heavens then available.<br />Brahe's obsession with accuracy was recorded in volumes of notes.  Too busy watching the stars to analyse his own data, the numbers became the obsession of the defendant in the case, Johannes Kepler.  Unlike Brahe's aristocratic background, Kepler was from straightened circumstances.  His father had even abandoned the family to fight in the religious wars.  His humble beginnings were later offset by an intolerable arrogance - the first step in the Gilder's brief.  With monumental mathematical skills he initiated a new theory of planetary motion.  For centuries, astrology, of which Kepler was a avowed advocate, was based on a circular orbit.  Kepler constructed a new model of planet movement.  The proofs, however, lay in Brahe's four decades of observations.  How to obtain them became his life's obsession.  According to the Gilders, it finally led him to murder.<br />The Gilders recount the sudden onset of urinary problems Brahe suffered during one of the ostentatious banquets he attended.  Although there was a period of recovery, Brahe was again subject to the symptoms, finally succumbing.  None suspected foul play might have been involved until a 20th Century analysis indicated something was amiss.  From the data, the Gilders attempt to reconstruct a scenario.  Eliminating various suspects and other causes, such as mishandling toxic materials, they conclude Brahe was the victim of Kepler's ambition to obtain Brahe's data.  Although the case is strong, it's hardly air-tight.  The biggest flaw is their inability to place Kepler with Brahe at the appropriate times.  Motive is the strongest evidence, but hardly convincing enough.  Still, this remains an exciting story, offering many insights into the characters' abilities and motivations.

Money wasted is money lost and the reputations of auto repairmen are vital.<br />Money is an issue for Mma Holonga, as well.  She has money - lots of it.  She's a successful businesswoman.  Her success is due to hard work, good investments and careful planning.  All this dedicated effort has left her no time to seek a husband, so she's decided to enter the marriage market.  It's bigger than expected and she commissions Mma Ramowatse to investigate her suitors.

With a clear grasp of the ways of the men and women of this remote African nation, he vividly portrays a life largely alien to our own.  Haste is scorned and honesty and manners warmly endorsed.  Mma Ramotswe's \\"traditional build\\" is starkly contrasted with the flash trim figures gaudily clothed by today's girls.  Superficial thinking has no place in detective work, and Mma Ramotswe has no time for shallow reasoning.  The author's Scots ancestry has much bearing in his thinking, but it's not dour Calvinism.  McCall Smith's wit is unmatched among today's writers.  His ability to cram many vital concepts in his brief narrations is excellent.  The books, especially this one, are readable at many levels.

It takes a certain amount of fortitude to confront your own doom.  Ward and Brownlee, having acutely described life's beginnings in &quot;Rare Earth&quot;, here portray the mechanisms of its end.  With the course of life's evolution revealed in the work of many researchers, depicting the finale has rarely been attempted.  Recent studies of the past have given the authors the tools for forecasting the future.  They use the history of the planet to suggest the &quot;tape of life&quot; will be rerun - backwards.  Changing conditions will reduce the options life has to continue surviving.  As a swelling sun and dehydrating Earth limit choices, life will revert to simpler, hardier forms.  At some point, although far in the future, life's opportunities will end.  A bleak barren world will likely be consumed by Sol's energetic transformation into a red giant star.  A lifeless planet will either skirt the circumference of that swollen star or be consumed in its fires.<br />Although a fiery conclusion is the ultimate finale, there are many intermediate steps along the path.  Ice, which has covered our planet many times in the past, is shown here as one of the major signs of the impending finish.  Seas withdraw from coastlines and habitat zones shrink dramatically.  Weather patterns undergo massive changes from what we experience.  The authors use &quot;time transport&quot; techniques to enable you to envision the impact of these drastic variations.  You visit future scenarios where plant life's extinction has taken herbivores with it.  Grasses exist for a bit, but it's too desolate for complex grazers to enjoy them.  Harsh winds scream across those savannahs, dehydrating the soil until the grasses, too, finally expire.  These conditions, Ward and Brownlee contend, have likely already begun.  The peak of plant diversity may already be behind us.  Animal extinctions, accelerated  by our presence, must surely follow.<br />What of humanity, then?  Raised with the ideal that we are evolution's &quot;purpose&quot;, we believe we can overcome nature's greatest challenges.  It's clear that even our esteemed technology must fall short of coping with an overheating Sun.  The authors, who have dealt with extinctions in the past, deal ambiguously with the logic of human continuation to a distant future.  While most species survive for a few million years, they suggest we will still be present when vast changes begin.  They weigh the issues of our possible escape from the doomed planet in terms of will, available resources, advanced technologies and likely havens.  All come up somehow short.  A bleak prospect indeed.<br />The authors' expressive style captures your attention throughout.  Not an academic study, yet still a serious assessment, this book will keep your attention throughout.  With the new science of astrobiology as their foundation, little of their narrative is idle speculation.  They write with authority, yet present their theme as a drama.  Actors come and go, struggle to maintain their roles, but succumb in tragic circumstances.  Referring to this book as compelling reading is almost damning with faint praise.  While the scenarios are projected billions of years in the future, we can initiate many of the processes through carelessness.<br /><br />Incorporating many ideas and research information in a mere 200 pages is a major accomplishment.  Ward and Brownlee, with their wide knowledge and almost florid style have produced a fine work.  As a summary of geology, astrophysics, evolutionary biology and atmospheric sciences, this is a unique and admirable synthesis.

The experiment is mammalian sex.  The investigation into how best to reproduce and extend the species is running out of material - the Y chromosome.  In a beautifully written, if somewhat suspect, work, Sykes surveys how sex became the driving force of evolution and what that means for humanity today - and tomorrow.<br />He describes the years of research, including many false starts, leading to the identity of the chromosomes determining our gender.  Knowledge of the chromosomes came soon after Darwin's revelation of evolution by natural selection.  Darwin realized that sex played a fundamental role in the mechanism of evolution, but the details remained an enigma.  Unaware of genes, he still managed to envision the role of sexual selection among animals.  When the process of cell division was understood, it led to searching for the means by which traits were transmitted through generations.  \\"Dark blobs\\" observed by a Canadian military physician began the quest for their identity and significance.  The find led to identity of the X-chromosome that forms females.  The Y-chromosome, which drives a foetus to become a male, was a later discovery.<br />In Sykes' view, the human male's chromosome has been the major factor in human evolution and cultural development.  Not only determining gender, it acts through a feedback loop.  More powerful, aggressive males tend to reinforce their role in selecting mates and propagating traits in offspring.  While the Sykes' progenitor has nearly ten thousand descendants, the MacDonald clan, long dominant in Scotland, has proliferated around the planet with nearly half a million progeny.  The most numerous progeny, however, has resulted in 16 million descendants of Asia's Ghengis Khan scattered throughout Eurasia.  The Khan is the most extreme example of the male's propensity for war, conquest, and, in Sykes' view, the \\"enslavement\\" of women.  His descent into the depths of \\"political correctness\\" is brief and shallow, but telling for his thesis.<br />Today the planet is carpeted with humanity, the result of a society dominated by the Y-chromosome.  When hunter-gatherer societies took up agriculture, it \\"chained women\\" to \\"serial pregnancies\\", depriving them of the \\"relaxation of a sedentary existence\\" while producing additional farm workers.  The resulting population explosion ultimately drove the creation of our industrialized, polluting society.  This condition, in Sykes' view, is now leading to a depletion of the Y-chromosome's prowess.  Ultimately, he argues, human males will be replaced by a society of women.  Whether men will be kept as breeding stock he doesn't predict.<br />A practiced adept at metaphor, Sykes' finesse in describing cellular mechanics is unusual in a scientist.  He portrays a slow-motion ballet, with chromosomes gently finding their opposite number to \\"delicately lie alongside each other\\" until \\"they are entwined\\".  It's very sensuous genetics.  The tone changes when he portrays the head of a sperm entering an egg.  The ensuing scene is a battle reminiscent of a Hollywood war film.  Mitochondria launch vicious assaults on invaders, slaughtering whatever can be attacked.  One wonders how conception ever occurs.  It does, of course, but he makes clear that a decline in success is inevitable.<br />Although Sykes builds a compelling case for the roots of our society's ills, there are too many ignored aspects.  He challenges the recent paper by a team demonstrating the Y-chromosome's prowess at self-repair.  His arguments require further study, but his adamant insistence smacks of desperation, not evidence.  Although this book is a valuable study, there's more work to do.  With so much of human evolutionary history to be assessed, we can consider this an important, but not a final, step.

Because we tend to think these debates are confined to the realms of philosophy and theology, we ignore the contribution medicine has made to our perception of the &quot;self&quot;.  Carl Zimmer's examination of the debate and its significant participants enlarges our outlook.  His depiction of the life of Thomas Willis in tumultuous 17th Century Britain reveals the pioneering research that lead to a new view of the body's functions.  The &quot;soul&quot;, so long a mysterious concept, began to be exposed in the brain and its relation to the rest of the body.  The study of illnesses, particularly those associated with behaviour, disclosed how false traditional views truly were.<br />The ancients, Zimmer explains, had varying ideas about the body's workings.  He summarises the many views, noting how certain ancient thinkers, particularly Galen, came to be adopted by Christianity.  Once admitted within the Church's fold, their teachings became part of the established dogma.  Orthodoxy substituted for observation, inhibiting learning.  The number of lives lost is incalcuable, but dissent through evidence was perilous.  Even the Greeks, Zimmer reminds us, considered dismembering cadavers distasteful.  Real medicine was thus kept in check for centuries.<br />While Protestantism overthrew many dogmas, medicine remained a restrained science.  The issue of the &quot;soul&quot;, where it resided and how it functioned, remained an enigma.  The stomach, liver and heart were all candidates for the home of the &quot;soul&quot;.  The brain was viewed as a &quot;useless mass of grey porridge&quot;.  Zimmer's illuminating study depicts the revolution Willis wrought in explaining the brain's central role.  He learned to dissect the brain, which decays faster than other organs, and initiated explanations of the nervous system.  His illustrator was none other than Christopher Wren, famous Restoration architect.  Together, they demonstrated the brain's arterial and nerve arrangement in what became known as the Circle of Willis - the entwined network of signal systems and energy resources.  The collaboration was published as &quot;The Anatomy of the Brain&quot;, the founding document of the science of neurology.<br />Willis established what Zimmer describes as the &quot;four pillars of neurology&quot;.  The first of these is the interaction of the body through the nerves to the brain. Second, the body's activities can be mapped in particular areas in the brain.  Stimulation and response thus become predictable - showing the brain is structured, not merely an incohate melange of &quot;grey porridge&quot;.  Third, Willis and his followers demonstrated the similar structure of the brains of all animals.  Tests showed clearly the body-brain interaction is common to all creatures.  Finally, abnormal behaviour and many illnesses can be chemically treated.  Although Zimmer describes today's world as &quot;awash in brain drugs&quot;, benefits can be derived through proper therapy.<br />Although Zimmer covers a wealth of material, from the ancient Greeks through modern times, you aren't overwhelmed by this history.  With an accessible prose style, he explains how growing knowledge of the body led to a new science.  He communicates his own enthusiasm effortlessly, drawing the reader into the story.  Each chapter is prefaced by an illustration of the material - all drawn from Wren's depictions.  The only lack in these graphics is a modern diagram of the brain's anatomy.  His concluding chapter on modern brain mapping details brain areas reflecting particular functions and emotions.  The brain may be divided physcially, but the neural network is a highly integrated structure.  Zimmer has produced a compelling study of the medical and the metaphysical.

She's killed the \\"Quin\\" of the Faeries - with a skillet!  Her grandmother, a woman of Power, was a subtle force among the Chalk Downs shepherd community.  With such a background, it's inevitable that she is destined for an interesting life.  She's already been a kelda to the Nac Mac Feegles - the pictsies who scutter among the barns and bushes of the local farms.  Now, she's been selected by the doyenne of the Ramtops' witches, Mistress Weatherwax, to be trained in The Craft.<br />Tiffany's clearly inherited some of her gran's Power, but is too young to understand or cope with it.  Something else wants that Power.  The hiver is a formless thing constantly seeking minds to inhabit.  While not truly evil, its effect is deadly.  It's inhabited Tyrannosaurs, sabre-toothed tigers and wizards.  Yet it's still not sated.  Tiffany's young, untested and vulnerable mind seems an ideal roost for the hiver.  Thus, the story, told as only Pratchett can relate it, becomes a contest of wills - Tiffany's, the hiver, her mentor, Nac Mac Feegle and all.<br />So, is this just another simple fantasy about witchcraft and the eternal struggle between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" - a dark versus light dichotomy?  Not in Pratchett's knowledgeable hands.  The Feegle, Tiffany's staunch allies, are thieves and boozers, in strife with anything that moves.  Miss Level, Tiffany's assigned trainer, leads a double life - and more than one of those.  The Chalk Downs aren't just white rocky paddocks - they bear a history of life reaching millions of years in the past.  Part of the Power is understanding that heritage, and perhaps putting it to use.  And just why was the Uffington White Horse carved on a hillside so that can't be seen clearly until you're above it?  And why is the carving in parts instead of a complete rendition?  Um . . . and is it really a cat?  Pratchett's ability to challenge the reader instead of merely being entertaining is unexcelled.  This book is a prime example.<br />Tiffany's confrontation with the hiver reveals its hidden origins.  They are as remote as Time itself.  While the hiver enters but one mind at a time, it represents an aspect of all living things.  Pratchett's resolution of the hiver's invasion of the young witch's mind is superbly crafted.  But the story doesn't end with that denouement.  Tiffany must attend on Granny Weatherwax, who initiated this situation.  In this finale, Pratchett draws one of the most glorious passages of his career.  Esme Weatherwax can Borrow - entering the minds of creatures more subtly than the hiver's occupation.  Is it her in the swarm of bees Tiffany encounters?  Or have they collectively responded to the presence of so powerful a witch?  Whatever the cause, Tiffany and the swarm perform a dance - of victory?  of acceptance?  or just for the pleasure of it?<br />With his superb style - a recipe of mirth, pathos, philosophy and irony, Pratchett has again shared his genius with us.  All of us.  As many have noted, putting a \\"readers' age\\" restriction on this book is a flawed limitaton.  Pratchett, in whatever he writes, is unaged and ageless.  Adults and children alike will find entertainment and value here.  The best approach, in this reviewer's opinion, is for adults to buy this book and read it aloud - to anybody.

632780:US	50941451	R3QWN16A6U640L	0007126921	243660926	Life in Britain and Ireland Before the Romans	Books	5	58	61	N	N	An impassioned look back	Pryor is candid about his intentions.  He wants to understand the society of his homeland.  To gain that understanding, he's dug more holes than &quot;found in Blackbourne, Lancashire&quot;.  He's also swept the literature of prehistoric Britain to learn what his colleagues have revealed in their work.  The result is a compelling narrative of how Britain, in the years before the Roman invasion, lived, worshipped and died.  He's gone a step further in trying out the life for himself.  It all boils down to what might be an exercise in chauvinism, but Pryor's too professional to sink into that morass.  Instead, he's given us a superb overview of the roots of the British Isles.  He also provides an superlative insight into the workings of modern archaeology.<br />The title reflects Pryor's view that too much attention has been paid to the Roman era.  Christianity's invasion on Roman skirt-tails, of course, has diverted attention from the beliefs of pre-Roman peoples.  He wants to set that record straight, and does so thoroughly and admirably.  Drawing on a wealth of resources, he casts away the &quot;invasion&quot; foundation of British pre-history to build a new structure.  Sweeping hordes give way to a society that spread cultural innovations through limited, but far-reaching mobility.  Instead of defensive fortresses, the British Isles are pocked with &quot;henges&quot;, religious centres reflecting a stable, ancestor-worshipping society.  Henges, he reminds us, totally lack defensive features.  Weapons are found as often in bogs and streams, or buried with owners.  They aren't the detritus of battle.<br />Pryor's start is the now-famous site of Boxgrove.  His account of the finds there, a stone tool preparation site nearly half a million years old, is nearly as vivid as Mike Pitts' own.  The site reflects the changing nature of archaeology - more attention is now devoted to assessing what the environment was like in that distant time.  Weather, soil, forest or field, are among the many elements now assessed in building a picture of ancient humanity's life.  Instead of racks of museum collections, tools, weapons and jewellry now form images of what our ancestors considered important.  If Pryor delves into speculation in his depictions, it's clearly an informed conjecture.  Details, hidden in time, may remain hidden, but much more is now available to consider than earlier researchers had at their disposal.<br />Pryor demonstrates how modern research has discerned Neolithic paddocks and trackways.  Faint lines in crops or discontinuities in the soil exposed by aerial photography have led to amazing finds.  His descriptions of discoveries, digs exposing ancient structures and artefacts reveal a wealth of new information while imparting Pryor's own love of the science.  That affection carries over into his accounts of how his ancestors lived.  To him, this information is intensely valuable.  If nothing else, it shatters long-held, but false myths about what comprises the British peoples.  People today will understand themselves better if they understand their ancestors better.  If that reduces aggression, bigotry and dogma, that's all to the good.  In Pryor's hands, archaeology becomes more than an arcane science removed from society.  Instead, the research becomes a force for positive thinking and, hopefully, action.<br />With such an outlook, this author has produced an immensely readable book.  His fondness for the work and the discoveries is apparent.  He exhorts you to share it all with him.  He draws the reader into the questions his research seeks to answer.  His enthusiasm is contagious - you want to be there at the various digs and museums with him.  If you can't arrange that, he provides a multitude of drawings, maps and photograph sets to help convey what he's seen.  There are the dead, their possessions, sometimes their dress.  Different conditions, he explains, preserve different things.  Where they haven't been preserved, he reconstructs them.  The wattle and thatch house at Fengate is built to verify how it was done.  With all these elements assembled in one book, it becomes clear that Pryor has created a lasting volume.  British focus aside, this book should be a feature on any shelf.  It's about you.

Although the title suggests yet another climate study, this isn't a simple analysis of our weather systems.  Fagan places the human condition at the centre of his narrative.  It's not enough to present more evidence of global warming.  In fact, he's adamant about the causes of current climate change being a &quot;side debate&quot;.  He's much more concerned about how many climate shifts humanity has experienced and how we reacted to them.  His theme is our adaptability to weather changes in the past and whether we can garner lessons for the future.<br />Establishing a scenario beginning twenty thousand years ago, Fagan lines out three Acts for the peopling of the Americas.  The first is in &quot;the primodial homeland&quot;, Ice Age Siberia, followed by conditions revealed about the Beringian Land Bridge of fifteen thousand years ago.  The final act takes us to the chaotic Atlantic and the European environment.  Conditions were rarely stable as &quot;the glaciers were never still&quot;.  Their &quot;irregular dance&quot; kept conditions variable and human response was adapt or perish.  Canadian fresh meltwater interrupted the Gulf Stream letting harsh cold envelope Europe.<br />Human adaptibility often meant improvements on older technologies or innovative ones to cope with the result of climate change.  Spears, later with atlatls - &quot;spear throwers&quot; to improve range and accuracy, then bows, were significant tools.  Yet, one of the most momentous inventions was the needle - still in use almost unchanged today.  This device could produce layered clothing, a major adaptive step in times of abrupt weather changes.<br />Weather changes can be due to single events - even those occurring at intervals like El Nino.  A critical solitary event happened around 6200 BCE with the &quot;implosion&quot; of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.  The cascade of fresh water into the North Atlantic created drought conditions throughout Europe and the eastern Mediterranean while raising ocean levels.  This rise later led to a catastrophe when the Mediterranean found an outlet to the Euxine Lake.  The inflow created the Black Sea, driving people west into the Danube Valley and changing human society in the area drastically.  Continuing fluctuations brought further challenges to increasing populations.  Stable food supplies provided by agriculture reduced mobility and fed population growth.  The cost was people tied to the land and a new vulnerability to climate change.<br />Fagan's example of this new situation is found in the history of a California people known as the Chumash.  These coastal people had deep ties with family members living inland.  The arrangement kept food supplies relatively stable through exchange networks.  This continuum expanded over a large area resulting in concomitant population growth.  When expansion was no longer feasible, war substituted for exchange systems.  Not a violent people, the conflicts were the result of environmental pressure on food resources.  A drastic social change took place around 1150 AD.  The lost networks were restored through a new arrangement.  The family system was shelved for a new oligarchy of powerful community leaders working cooperatively with meagre, but sustaining food stocks.  While the Chumash remained vulnerable to climate vagaries, they didn't starve as in the past.<br />Fagan stresses that vulnerability has been built into modern society.  Civilisation is a high-stakes game, and the planet is the banker.  Most of the cards we played in the past are now in the discard pile.  Mobility is not an option when the planet is so thoroughly occupied.  New technologies will not provide new lands submerged by rising seas nor blighted by drought.  If the Gulf Stream fails again, as it has in the past, it will be all Europe faced with the need for a new home.  Where?  A Europe covered in ice will produce drought throughout western Asia and likely beyond.  It isn't the cause of climate change that requires examination, but what must be done to deal with, Fagan urges.  The &quot;stewardship&quot; of resources successfully adopted by some societies must be invoked again.  That requires a knowledgeable population, briefed by readers of this book.  This is far from a &quot;should read&quot; book - it is a &quot;must read&quot; for us all.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]roughout western Asia and likely beyond.

And to survive.<br />The &quot;rich and powerful&quot; have gained their status through &quot;hi-tech&quot; corporations, who run the Compounds like Company Towns of a century ago.  Atwood lists their ever more bizarre products as she drags us through her litany of fears of The Biotech Monster.  Artificial organs are bred in &quot;pigoons&quot;.  &quot;Wolvogs&quot;  and &quot;rakunks&quot; are &quot;designed&quot; for roles unreliably played by their wild forebears.  Jimmy's parents were part of this scientist-turned-businessman culture until his mother decamped.  Although distant, Jimmy's relationship with his mother forms a sub-theme in the story.  Never a &quot;numbers type&quot;, Jimmy passes through the usual painful adolescence.  During that transition, he encounters Crake, a moody, introspective boy.  Crake goes on to become a powerful figure in the biotech industry while Jimmy languishes as a scribe for a nondescript promotional firm.<br /><br />Throughout his life, Jimmy is haunted by the image of a child he viewed on the Internet.  Atwood teases out her story like an imbedded splinter.  Oryx, named because she knows no other, has led a horrific existence, but only Jimmy is angry about that.  Between them, Oryx and Crake form the Yin and Yan of Jimmy's existence.  Ultimately, that duality extends to all humanity.  For Crake, in his demented wisdom, has created a new species of human - the Children of Oryx and Crake.  Jimmy is forced to assume the role of interlocutor between the creator and their &quot;offspring&quot;.  He's chosen because he may be the last living human on the planet.<br />Atwood would have you believe she's heavily researched this book.  Yet the result of those labours is merely a scattering of terms, some hazy ideas, and a goat farm outside Montreal.  We are dazzled by the organic creations - none of which are likely, while being led along by her imaginative fears.  Having no science to apply to the narrative, it's simply fabricated.  This isn't even speculation, it's calamity-howling to inflame the reader, but to what end is left unsaid.  The book reads like a children's ghost story.<br />Obviously, some research was done, but it wasn't in science.  Her attention was clearly captured by the &quot;sci-fi&quot; novels of the 1950s.  She has used the future to take us back in [literary] time.  The plot of this book is so ancient it might have been scratched on Neolithic cave walls.  There are no surprises, a dearth of innovation and the story utterly transparent.  The characterisation is even worse.  Her protagonists are a hubris-ridden, world-destroying genius, an angelic innocent a Barbie would envy, and a bumbling adolescent who seems destined never to mature.  They are cardboard portrayals of a type long abandoned even by science fiction writers.<br />If you desire good S-F try Robert Sawyer or Greg Bear.  This book is a waste of time and funds.

However, his iconoclastic assault on the dogma of human global diaspora is challenging.  Without overstressing it, he uses the title to trash even older dogmas.  To his credit, he refrains from personal assaults as he lays out the evidence genetics provides in tracing our prehistory.  In all, he manages to show how a new science is providing answers to old questions.  Where did modern humanity rise?  How and when did it spread over the planet to occupy nearly every available niche?  What kind of future does this imply for our species?<br />None of these questions is easily resolved, as Oppenheimer stresses often.  With earlier answers based on the imperfect fossil record, on which many fine careers have been built, offering new responses takes courage.  In anthropology, the response had better have good evidence in support.  His support is impressive, reaching back through time and space to our earliest origins in Africa.  From there he demonstrates that our Eurocentric view of ourselves needs serious revision.  Humanity reached Europe late in our migrations.  European humanity didn't invent &quot;art&quot;, agriculture didn't arise in the Fertile Crescent spreading to girdle the globe, and Native Americans likely settled the Western Hemisphere prior to the last great Ice Age.<br />Oppenheimer relies on two newly-developed tools in his analysis: mitochondrial DNA and mutations in the Y chromosome.  Mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA], the marker handed down from mother to daughter, has already pointed to a common ancestor to us all.  Living in Africa about 150 thousand years ago, she's been [regrettably] dubbed the Mitochondrial Eve.  The author deplores this appellation, but accepts its nearly universal usage.  The Y chromosome, passed on to sons, is a firmer marker for location, if less precise in time.  He uses both to trace a new migration route for humanity.  The route is along the southern shoreline from Africa, across India's triangular coastline to Southeast Asia and Australia.  He reminds us that the Australian Aborigines have the longest uninterrupted heritage of all humans.  Yet, he notes, they are the same as the rest of us in all important features.<br />The coastal route, guided by mountain ranges and ice incursions, resulted in some unexpected revelations about that European viewpoint.  Instead of creeping around the eastern Mediterranean to populate Europe, these migrants, &quot;beachcombers&quot; in his word, entered from the Asian steppes to the east.  Already inhabited by the Neandertals, this invasion ultimately displaced the indigenous population - a depressingly familiar story.  Marshalling the research done over the past few years, including the genetics, the rise and fall of the seas due to ice trapping the water, and tying it to the available fossil evidence, Oppenheimer revises a century of theories.  It's an exemplary summary of current research while pointing out the work remaining to be done.<br />To many, the most interesting chapter is the contentious field of &quot;the Peopling of the Americas&quot;.  It is here that Oppenheimer introduces some of the disputants.  The issue of who emigrated to the Western Hemisphere is tightly meshed with when it occurred.  The &quot;Clovis point&quot; stone tools, long considered the benchmark in palaeoanthropology, is sharply challenged by both fossil and genetic evidence.  The genetic picture is made up of four basic branches traceable, according to the author, to Japan and eastern China.  These people, he stresses, didn't flow into North America from there, however.  Instead, they took up residence in a &quot;temporary continent&quot; - Beringia - that formed when the ice lowered sea levels.<br />Oppenheimer's knowledge of the research processes is clearly imparted to readers.  He  explains how the new science of phylogeography starts at a &quot;twig of the molecular tree&quot; and can trace backthrough time and place on a map.  The map shows our wanderings, and he gives us the maps to illustrate them.  He supplies diagrams of the molecular relationships acting as guides.  To complete the picture, he also provides environmental charts showing how migrations were guided by changing climate.  It's a vivid, complete picture, with few flaws or omissions.  In fact, the only complaint i can offer about this book is the references, which are integrated in the Notes at the back of the book.  To garner a list of his sources, you must read the Notes as closely as you do the main text.  It's not a chore you should shun, but the cross-referencing is tedious.  A tiny blemish, it detracts nothing from the book. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]e back through time and place on a map.

It's a Discworld, resting on the backs of four elephants, who stand on a massive tortoise swimming through space.  There's magic here, symbolised by the eighth colour of the rainbow - octiron.  There's little magic done in this story, but the tale itself is more compelling than any stage sleight-of-hand.  For while there are trolls, dryads, barbarian heroes, it is the real people who are the focus.  Publishers, notorious for lacking a sense of humour, label this book &quot;Fantasy&quot;.  Don't be fooled.  This book is the first step in a journey to face ourselves - a tramp to realms of reality, presented with wit and wisdom.<br />Rincewind, a failed &quot;wizzard&quot; is given the task of guiding, and guarding, the Discworld's first tourist.  Originating in the Counterweight Continent, Twoflower is an insurance clerk.  He knows about the &quot;reflected sounds of the underground spirits&quot; - echo-gnomics.  Introducing the concept to the denizens of Ankh-Morpork, the Disc's greatest city, proves disastrous.  Rincewind, who knows the City is experienced in disasters, is more concerned with his own survival, which is threatened at every turn.  Yet, like the City, he bounces back to confront the next crisis.  He has some help, in the form of one of the Eight Spells, which, if improperly invoked, may distort Time and Space.  It's a heavy responsibility, especially for one who's so adept at dodging such burdens.<br />While the magic is subdued, nothing subdues the gods but each other.  Overseeing the Discworld, the panoply of deities idle the days with The Game.  The contenders, Blind Io, chief of the gods, Offler the Crocodile God, and Fate, cast dice to guide the movements of the Board's pieces.  These, of course, are Rincewind and other denizens of Discworld.  Logic says Fate must be the ultimate winner, but The Lady is a strong opponent.  She is the one goddess who arrives at her own whim, as Rincewind learns to his distress.<br />All these deities, characters and events are presented in the most compelling style.  Pratchett is a master of language and offers levels of wit, pathos, characterisation and story rarely matched and never excelled.  He also adds science to a field usually devoid of real knowledge.  The combination is explosive, while demanding reflection.  For that is the purpose of his writing - to mirror another world, ours.  There's a laugh per page, but when you've wiped your eyes, you'll realize there's far more here than humour.  Start with this volume and be prepared to continue the trek.

Actually, he has two stories: one, his own, describing the life of a writer in Hussein's Baghdad and the other with the same theme.  The difference is that the first tells the story of the second.  Why is Sheriff fenced in at a remote location of almost indescribeable desolation?  What abominable crime has put him there?  In answering these questions, Thomas Keneally has returned to the top rank of novelists.  He excels again with this modern tale of international politics, survival in an oppressive regime, and personal tragedy.  This is among the finest of Keneally's works.<br />Sheriff, a reputable writer, is recruited by Iraq's Great Uncle to post a message to the world.  The &quot;sanctions&quot; imposed by the victors of the First Gulf War have brought poverty, lack of food and water and depleted medical facilities to their country.  The whims of an arbitrary government, the absolutist nature of the leaders - already a dynasty in the making, and needless casualties from a meaningless war are minimal when contrasted to the universal suffering caused by curtailment of the oil exports.  Great Uncle wants Sheriff to expose this injustice through a novel depicting conditions.  Sheriff, who might have been willing and able to perform this feat, is afflicted by a more personal crisis - the loss of his wife Sarah.<br />&quot;Alan&quot;?  &quot;Sarah&quot;?  This couple is close friends with Matt McBrien and Andrew Kennedy.  Are these names typical of a Middle Eastern people?  Keneally deftly arabesques away from pigeon-holing these people and their circumstances as &quot;Arabs&quot; or even Muslims.  In depicting Sheriff's relations with &quot;Mrs Carter&quot;, for example, Keneally shows the universality of a mother's grief, the shameful machinations of a government engaged in useless and costly war, and the mixed feelings of soldiers.  He doesn't want to distance his characters from the reader - and the use of Anglo-Celtic names in a novel about a suffering people brings us closer to their realities.<br />With his vivid, expressive style, Keneally uses Sheriff to guide us through the harsh world of a despotic regime.  Whatever his faults, Hussein's Iraqi people was the true victim of a higher level of despotism - trade embargoes and external demands by international agencies.  Keneally describes a nation living on the edge of survival.  The people may have the Great Uncle's Blue Overalls at their doorstep, but they know it wasn't the Great Uncle that cut off their drinking water or intercepted the medicines.<br />The reader can always rely on Thomas Keneally for stories of intense feeling and wide interest.  He surpasses many of his earlier works with this modern story.  That the &quot;Coalition of the Willing&quot; have launched a crusade against the Great Uncle doesn't reduce the value of this book.  Keneally uses Sheriff to expose many facets of Iraqi life.  His wit and sardonic humour are more pointed here than any previous work.  Keneally's sense of justice is monumental.  It's a sense to be admired - better, to be emulated.  He knows there are no simple answers to human questions, and he displays that view in this exemplary book.

Looking beyond scattered fossils and debates over African origins or Multi-regional evolution of modern man, he views vast stretches of time and space.  What made a primate species descend from a forest canopy to become a skilled survivor on the African savannah.  How did it happen and when, he asks.  In answer, he provides a detailed examination of the environmental history surrounding and influencing our path.  We are still on that path, he reminds us.  We cannot separate ourselves from our surroundings.  Nor did we &quot;overcome&quot; the conditions nature set as we evolved.  Instead, conditions drove our evolution.<br />Potts surveys the remote past to set his theme - climate varies, sometimes catastrophically.  It may also change with stunning rapidity - as his noting of a Canadian site showing tundra becoming spruce forest in 150 years suggests.  There may be long periods of relative stability, as when Pangaea, home to the dinosaurs, dominated the scene.  At one time Antarctica had no ice sheet and the North Pole was tropical.  Continental breakup changed more than the landscape, it revised the weather.  This was no more true than in the Miocene [24 to 5.3 Mya] when weather patterns changed drastically.  And continued to change.<br />While all this meteorological madness was occurring, a certain primate species in Africa confronted the challenges shifting weather offered.  Overturning the old myth that early humans dropped out of the forest and learned to run, Potts shows how it was the forests that ran away.  He's quick to point out, however, that this was not a gradual nor a steady change.  Forests came and went, only to return.  Lakes filled and dried, then filled.  In order to survive, this primate population needed to adapt.  Some did, but others failed the challenge.  Those who succeeded, he argues, learned to follow the best scenario for survival.  Hence, humans began their great migrations across the globe.<br />When those migrations, combined with improved brain power, led humans to begin transforming their environment with agriculture, that transition wasn't as revolutionary as most anthropologists usually contend.  To Potts, it was simply an extension of the habits learned over the millennia.  Weather changes had been adapted for.  Changing the local environment by &quot;controlling&quot; it was simply another logical step in the sequence.  However, he reminds us, cultural growth, by which innovation is admired and becomes part of tradition, turned this adaptation into a philosophy.  &quot;Dominion over the Earth&quot; became a set piece of human thinking.  It's a dangerous philosophy leading us to make irrational choices in our dealings with the rest of nature.  Flexibility is lost as fewer species are relied upon to sustain us.  He gives the example of the New England colonists transforming the existing relationship Native Americans generally enjoyed.  Land use became limited in application, with whole tracts of forest and ecological balances disrupted.  The time span of these events is infinitesimal in contrast with the long ages of adaptation.  In thinking we can &quot;control&quot; what is uncontrollable, humans are flirting with disaster.

Relethford seeks to explain and reconcile some of the major themes in human evolution.  Each topic is introduced with a presentation of \\"traditional\\" views.  These are lined out fully and each seems to have sufficient support for a conclusive case.  Relethford has been busy keeping up with the latest research, and the remainder of each section relates much of that.  By the end of each section, it's clear that the old view has been successfully challenged.  However, as the author frequently points out, many questions remain open.  Little of this book provides final answers.  He wants more work done.  Much of the book is an appeal for newcomers to the field to find opportunities.<br /><br />No approach is better suited to gaining an understanding of the path humanity has taken in its spread around the planet.  Relethford's style keeps your attention on the topics.  He presents the information clearly and succinctly.  The flow is good and requires little \\"back-flipping\\" to understand what he's trying to accomplish.  As a geneticist, his focus is on gene indicators.  The fossil record, while providing a firm foundation, is clearly not definitive in his view.  It is the genetic record of humanity that has provided the clearest picture of how and when humans came out of Africa to populate the world.  Fossils are a guide, but the path is better marked by gene markers.  They offer a more complete picture of our wanderings.<br />\\"More complete\\" doesn't do justice to Relethford's approach.  He lacks the dogmatic approach of many of his colleagues.  The balanced treatment makes this book especially valuable, particularly to one new to the topics.  As the book progresses the focus becomes ever tighter.  After giving a general description of African origins, he summarises our knowledge of the Neandertals.  Co-existent with our species, he considers the questions of species identity, the possibilities of interbreeding with Homo sapiens and extinction.  In a related section he considers the onset of agriculture - did it spread from a single point of origin, or emerge in dispersed locations?  He also examines the origins and progress of Native Americans and Polynesians.  Closing the book with pinpoint examples, he explains the genetic history of islands on the Eire coast and the relationship of Jewish population elements.  The historical issues are examined and countervailing ideas set against them.<br />Relethford provides a fine range of illustrations, including maps and analytical graphs to expand on the text.  Some of these require close attention as they simplify some rather complex analytical techniques.  The captions, in many cases, are essential - which doesn't detract from the information value.  The References are almost entirely academic, making tracing difficult for the general reader for whom this book was produced.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]h Homo sapiens and extinction.

Although escaping the horrendous casualty lists of the European nations, Americans aped Continental disillusionment with their own, anaemic version, of it.  Retaining greater resources, America's wealthy survivors returned to Europe, filled with cynicism and indifference.  Few books have caught the attitudes of interwar Americans as vividly as this one.  It is a Judas kiss in depicting  America's social values of the time.  Few could enjoy the life he describes, yet all aspired to it.  Fitzgerald caught and portrayed the segment of that society most people seem to remember.  It's a limited view, but tightly focussed.<br />Richard Diver, married to what was then termed a &quot;neurotic&quot; woman, encounters a young movie star.  Films were still silent and actresses were chosen for their physical appeal.  Rosemary, although still a teen-ager, fills the image perfectly.  Immature, notorious and vivacious, she sets her sights on Diver.  Encouraged by her mother, although the motivation for this remains unclear, Rosemary applies her wiles on a man twice her age.<br />As the two encounter, separate and meet again, they interact with members of the expatriate community in France.  Fitzgerald portrays most of them through the couple's viewpoint.  The depictions are compelling and evocative, but there isn't an appealling one in the lot.  Diver's role in the new [then] Freudian psychology gives Fitzgerald a mechanism for exploring the human psyche.  The dismemberment of Freud's analysis by modern studies doesn't detract from Fitzgerald's descriptive prowess.  Even from this distance in time he's remains a writer to turn to and reflect on.  He's deservedly acclaimed as one of the &quot;greats&quot; of the twenties.<br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]	2004-05-25

For Francis Pryor it goes further - becoming muddy, peaty, mucky and worse.  And that's ignoring the incoming tide filling excavations.  Dusty, mucky or just plain wet, the business is rewarding.  It tells us about the past and, hence, about ourselves.  His focus is the British Isles, particularly eastern England, and how ancient societies there developed over time.  In some cases the span of time is vast.  Many of those developments have persisted to our day, while others were cast aside.  Pryor neatly summarises the work of many years in this book.  He describes the current thinking during his schooling, then demonstrates how new analysis techniques and data interpretation have overthrown old concepts.<br />Pryor is passionate about his field.  He shares that passion expressively and it proves infectious.  He doesn't hide disappointment or failure, because the successes reap rich rewards.  He's found ancient pastures long hidden by modern farms.  He's revealed tracks for livestock and humans alike.  The pathways reveal indications of human value systems, the locations are sites of sacrifice and limits of family holdings.  Burial sites, unlike our modern sterile cemetaries, are rich with artefacts hinting of social hierarchies.  The distribution of the sites refute the notion that Western Europe was overrun by peoples invading from the east.  War, he argues, never happened on the scale earlier writers described.  Instead of closed villages, fortresses and stockades, Britain's early people were scattered widely, groupings based on family ties.  The nearest thing to war was cattle rustling raids by young men expressing their prowess - perhaps even part of marriage rituals.<br />Pryor's best known find is the mis-named &quot;Seahenge&quot;.  At Holme-Next-the-Sea along the coast of The Wash, his team discovered an oak stockade.  Within the circle of logs was an inverted oak stump.  Pryor reluctantly accepts the media's designation for this site, although it by-passes the accepted definition of &quot;henge&quot;.  He wants to understand why such a structure was built is of greater importance to him.  Unlike stone circles, the logs of Seahenge form a solid barrier.  The stump, lacking evidence of being a burial site, remains an enigma, although Pryor offers a reasonable suggestion.  Seahenge became of scene of conflict between science and New Age religionists.  Pryor's account of the resolution of the issues makes wonderful reading.  As does all the book.<br />Pryor offers insights into how the work of archaeology is done and what it reveals.  Local conditions clearly set social systems.  Seahenge, he asserts, was a local shrine of limited use and duration.  It stands in sharp contrast to sites in use for millenia.  He reminds us that most Neolithic communities, with their lifestyles and observances exceed the history of Christianity by a millennium or more.  The wooden trackway at Flag Fen, he notes, was in use &quot;from two centuries after the death of Tutankhamun to the lifetime of Christ&quot;.  In other words, a wooden walkway was used and maintained for 1300 years.  Such persistence, he argues, demonstrates that Neolithic Britons maintained a firm belief in a continuous state between the living and the dead.

Pryor's account of the resolution of the issues makes wonderful reading.  As does all the book.<br />Pryor offers insights into how the work of archaeology is done and what it reveals.  Local conditions clearly set social systems.  Seahenge, he asserts, was a local shrine of limited use and duration.  It stands in sharp contrast to sites in use for millenia.  He reminds us that most Neolithic communities, with their lifestyles and observances exceed the history of Christianity by a millennium or more.  The wooden trackway at Flag Fen, he notes, was in use &quot;from two centuries after the death of Tutankhamun to the lifetime of Christ&quot;.  In other words, a wooden walkway was used and maintained for 1300 years.  Such persistence, he argues, demonstrates that Neolithic Britons maintained a firm belief in a continuous state between the living and the dead.

Perhaps he was busy playing his tuba.  Many years of his dealing with abused children generated this &quot;guidebook for parenting&quot;.  Like all such guidebooks, there are many pearls of wisdom and insightful conclusions.  There is also a wealth of self-contradictions, a limited arena to apply his useful advice and some terribly misleading assertions.  Underlying the entire presentation is the idea that children are putty in the hands of their parents.  All parents need do is take the proper approach [Newberger's] in raising their offspring and all will be well with the world.  Or, at least, those families living in North America.<br />Without clearly stipulating why he focusses on boys instead of children, he seems to feel that &quot;character&quot; is a mental/emotional state best expressed through the male half of society.  From this basis, he moves through the various elements he designates as building &quot;character&quot; and explains how to promote them.  There are many of them and Newberger is to be congratulated for taking on so formidable a task.  He covers the topics well, but as you read it becomes clear that only a limited sector of society will read or understand his programme.  A careful read will highlight the many contradictions he overlooked in developing his thesis.<br />After showing how many conflicts can arise between parents and offspring from an early age, he moves &quot;self-identity&quot; to adolescence.  This will console parents who thought the &quot;terrible twos&quot; were an event rivalling the French Revolution.  To further reassure parents, he condemns Judith Rich Harris' classic study &quot;The Nurture Assumption&quot; which transferred children's input from parents to peers.  That Newberger does this suggests he might have left his clinic occasionally and visited some elementary schoolyards.  Boys may appear malleable to parents, but in the schoolyard or street corner, they show a different set of talents.  Although Newberger discusses the &quot;hierarchical&quot; social structures that appear among boys, he seems to have no notion of how they emerge.<br />Newberger's appeal is limited to those parents with the intellect, time, patience, affluence and desire to follow his suggestions.  They must quell no end of natural responses in raising boys, and it would be enlightening to learn from the next generation how many of his readers will be in residence in a room with soft walls.  It is fallacious to assume that male children come into life with no natural ambitions and capabilities of their own.  Not many years ago, it was believed the concept of children, especially boys, coming into life with a &quot;blank slate&quot; had been permanently shelved.  Yet, here is Newberger, not only raising the issue again, but compiling a parenting guidebook based on that premise.  An infirm foundation for such an important structure.

This book is certain to reinforce that view.  Carter relates the assembling of an &quot;unlikely crew&quot; to duplicate a &quot;Viking&quot; voyage from Greenland to North America.  The voyage required two attempts [as you learn from the map preceding the text], and succeeded only after hilarious and desperate adventures.  But it did succeed.<br />Carter's account is intensely personal as he explains his motives to duplicate the &quot;Viking&quot; [apparently Carter was never taught the word &quot;Norse&quot;] voyages leading to the &quot;Vinland&quot; landings.  Long debated, &quot;Vinland&quot; became a real place with the revelation of a Norse settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland-Labrador in the 1960s.  With Norse voyages to &quot;Vinland&quot; recorded in 1000 CE, Carter's target date of exactly one millenium later seemed appropriate.<br />The only hitches were that Carter didn't know how to sail, didn't know anything about the Norse, their history, their boatbuilding techniques or their navigation methods.  A shaky start compounded by a crew of similar qualifications.  During the voyages, personality clashes make their inevitable appearance.  Although discussions about the route to follow are understandable, the debate over toilet paper use seems almost a diversion.  The primary issue of discussion is the rudder - it's shape, use and mounting.  That question remains fundamental since the rudder determines as much as the winds which track is best.<br />By the time you close the final page of this book, it's difficult to avoid feeling emotionally soiled.  Carter reaches his thirty-sixth birthday on this voyage.  The writing, however, is more in line with that of a sixteen-year old.  Carter spends so much time at whingeing about missing his family, self-abasement over his inadequacies as a &quot;leader&quot;, recounting the losses of wives and girlfriends by his mates, that reaching the Newfoundland coast seems anticlimatic.  That this inept and mismatched team survived a journey that once took countless lives is hardly reassuring.  If ever the gods were arbitrary in their machinations, they seemed to have proved it here.  That an amatuer crew survived an expedition against all odds is a mildly entertaining read, but hardly an inspirational one.

David Livingstone, Albert Russel Wallace, Richard Burton and others are readily recalled.  The polar quests of Amundsen, Cook, Peary and Byrd probably follow in popularity.  The upper latitudes seem almost overlooked.  With little land mass approaching Antarctica and its pole, Canada and Russia are left for investigation by the enquiring mind.  Having offered the life of one such wanderer in John Rae, McGoogan now reaches further back in time and place to reveal the life of Samuel Hearne.  It's a fine study of a dedicated man.<br />McGoogan's lively narrative traces Hearne's Royal Navy career, then follows him to the Hudson's Bay Company [HBC] station of Prince of Wales Fort.  With the Canadian Arctic still a terra incognita, various quests were under consideration - the Northwest Passage and/or an inland sea leading to Asia being prime contenders.  A more specific ambition arose with indications of a vast copper resource near the Arctic Sea.  Hearne pursued this rumour by trekking across the Canadian tundra to find it.  Various interludes occurred along the way.<br />Hearne's expeditions to the Arctic seem pre-ordained to failure.  Having but a hazy notion of what confronted him wasn't a hindrance.  Bureaucracy proved the more serious impediment.  The British attitude toward indigenous peoples compounded faulty notions of requirements for such a trip.  With no idea of how Native Peoples? societies were structured, British HBC agents blundered into one crisis after another.  In today's world, for a man to suggest that women must accompany the expedition to perform specialised tasks would bring down the wrath of the Human Rights Commission.  In the 18th Century rise of the HBC in Canada women performed essential roles.  No Native Peoples? women meant no Native Peoples? men.  No men, no expedition.  McGoogan explains all these circumstances without apology or condemnation.  It's a professional historian's approach, worthy of full praise.<br />The other aspect of British imperialism's shortsighted view is the relationships among Canada's Native Peoples.  Hearne and others would counsel peace to those who had been warring when the British still painted themselves blue.  These animosities were not easily quelled and might break out without warning nor discernible reason.  Hearne was confronted with this near the mouth of the Coppermine River.  McGoogan, relying on Hearne's own account, describes the massacre of an Inuit settlement leading to the naming of &quot;Bloody Falls&quot;.  The event remained fixed in Hearne's memory for the remainder of his life.<br />Hearne, seeking an ephemeral copper lode, traversed immense stretches of the Canadian North.  With various teams, but particularly relying on a Dene negotiator, Matonabbee, Hearne viewed the Arctic Ocean, the first European to reach it overland.  The copper wasn't there, nor, in Hearne's opinion, was there any possibility of a Northwest Passage.  He saw the Great Slave Lake, but when he later reported on his journey, skeptics were confounded by how far west it lay.  Canada's vastness overwhelmed chair-bounded geographers.  Hearne wasn't simply seeking mineral wealth.  He recorded copious observations on plant and animal life in the region, as well as collecting information on the native peoples.  More than just an adventurer, Hearne is credited by McGoogan as being one of earliest naturalists.<br />Hearne's return to England was less than satisfactory.  An account of his travels netted him not a penny - he died before publication.  One event, a likely meeting with Coleridge at a boy's school, may have led Hearne to become the source of the Rime of the Ancient Mariner.  While the notion is McGoogan's speculative idea, it's plausible enough to be valid.  It certainly provided a good, if unexpected, title for the life of an Arctic explorer.  McGoogan presents that life vividly, with only minor, forgiveable, embellishments.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]en a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]	2004-05-20

Scion of a Discworld aristocratic family, he's disdained both their money and their lifestyle.  Drifting into the city of Ankh-Morpork, he needs employment.  Since he's neither a Thief nor an Assassin, let alone a Seamstress [hem!  hem!], he must find employment.  Inevitably, it must have to do with words.  Not a spy nor a gossip, he generates a newssheet for selected clients - the aristocrats known through his family connections.  An encounter with a runaway machine [&quot;Stop the press!&quot;] on the street launches him into a new career.  Pratchett's account of de Worde's subsequent history is his finest work.  He draws on his own ancient stint as a journalist to provide a story both entertaining and insightful.<br />There's a rumour about that the dwarfs have learned to turn lead into gold.  The printing press is unknown in Ankh-Morpork.  The unknown is always fearful, but the dwarfs lust for gold overrides silly superstition.  They have a press and only require words to apply their magic transmutation.  William, initially reluctant, is there as the catalyst.  All he needs is input and it arrives with ferocious intensity.<br />There has been a crime - always the best news.  The Patrician [City Manager], Lord Vetinari, has assaulted his secretary and attempted to abscond with heavy monies.  This event brings out the City Watch in the guise of its Commander, Sam Vimes.  Most crimes are clear-cut, but this one seems meaningless.  We learn a plot's afoot, possibly perpetrated by two strangers in the city.  Mr Pim, dedicated and articulate, is accompanied by Mr Tulip, a man of chemical affinities whose language skills are indeterminate.  A man whose words are mostly &quot;---&quot; remains difficult to comprehend.  As strangers, these two become gradually aware of the forces Ankh-Morpork can unleash.<br />One of the leashed forces is Gaspode.  A scruffy, nondescript canine, Gaspode resides at the end of a piecemeal string borne by Foul Ol' Ron.  Ron, whose command of language is more limited than even Mr Tulip's, is a derelict.  He and his unsociable companions, however, become the purveyors of Worde's words.  That puts them in ideal places to observe.  They become almost reporters for The Ankh-Morpork Times.

The decline of respect for science and nature studies in the United States owes much to Michael Crichton.  In books such as Andromeda Strain and Jurrasic Park, he portrays Nature as a capricious force, needing only a thoughtless step or touch of greed to launch a cascade of uncontrollable events.  This book takes the theme a large step forward by using nanotechnolgy to present yet another threat to humanity.<br />Jack Forman, unemployed programmer, is a forty-year-old househusband to a wife successful in a new high-tech company.  Xymos, inevitably under military contract, is developing a reconnaissance technology using networking nanobots.  They've been programmed with predator algorithms to focus on &quot;goals&quot; to achieve their purpose.  Also inevitably, they elude control, escaping into the Nevada desert.  Their predation skills net them coyotes, rabbits and rattlesnakes - and certain microchips.  In the final inevitability, their ultimate prey is humans.  Jack, who understands their programming best, is called in as a consultant to show the rest of the research team how to restore control.<br />From this point Crichton's narrative unfolds like a film script [which, of course, is the intent].  There are deaths, the nanobots, following a contrived Darwinian ideal, evolve well beyond the intent of their original instructions.  They develop new skills at a stupendous rate, each step forward presenting a greater threat to Jack and his colleagues.  Jack's wife, Julia, arrives at the Nevada site, ostensibly in support.  Changes in her recent behaviour suggest, inevitably, she's having an affair with one of the team.  What appears to be illicit romance, however, proves something more sinister.  Inevitably, Jack is almost alone in his role as combative consultant.<br />Crichton is always as up-to-date with technology as the literature allows.  His extensive bibliography demonstrates his research to anyone's satisfaction.  That he can take it a step further only demonstrates his imaginative skills.  In line with many of his recent books, his  research has left him with little energy for a developed plot.  His characters are thin and events predictable.  It's a &quot;page turner&quot; to find out What Happens Next, but there's little doubt over the ultimate outcome.  Yet, as with most of his works, the conclusion is vague.  The reader is intentionally left unsatisfied.  This is as much a contribution to the vague disquiet over science and nature among his readers as the topic of the story.  While this might be viewed as a call for more and better research, Crichton makes it clear that he considers all science suspect.  That's an unfortunate attitude.

Even the Stock Market doesn't achieve the rises and falls exhibited by the field of archaeology. Except the focus here is on ideas, not finance. Jones describes the tumultuous history of understanding human evolution during the past century. From a few bones and broken pottery, archaeology tried to unravel the mysteries of our past. The implementation of molecular analysis techniques, he shows, has revealed information undreamt of only a generation ago. In this excellent summary, Jones explains how new research has established our roots, our progress around the planet, and mundane details of our past life in various locations.<br />The imaging of the DNA molecule opened new portals for explaining life's progress. Once it was understood DNA can change, sometimes at a calculable rate, tracking the modifications became a new analysis tool. &quot;Markers&quot; on the molecule can be studied and placed in a chronological context. Jones manages to explain both the markers and the analysis techniques in clear, jargon-free prose. It's not an easy task, but he achieves it admirably.<br />Through much of this book, the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; image remains a running theme. DNA from insects embedded in amber, however, proved an illusory quest. Although the insect bodies appeared intact, close inspection revealed the DNA was shattered long ago. Still further [and rather later] investigation resulted in some unexpected surprises - the insects didn't contain dinosaur DNA, but that of residents in their own guts. More than gut bacterial DNA survived- the entire organism was still living after millions of years.<br />The journey from &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; to realistic analysis has not been a smooth, linear path. Jones explains how new finds led to various theories of human evolution and migration with resultant cultural developments. The rise of agriculture was long held to have originated in one place, then spread across the planet. Molecular analysis techniques demonstrated the fallacy of that idea, Jones explains, revealing the evidence demonstrating the emergence of farming in various places. China's history of rice production preceded by centuries the grains produced in the Tigris-Euphrates area. Many other &quot;established&quot; concepts have been refuted by various methods of molecular analysis. Each new &quot;absolute&quot; is described by Jones as if irrefutably established. Then he discards the dogma with a flourish of new data.<br />The most compelling chapter in the book takes us away from DNA, with its many limitations, to &quot;the other molecules&quot;. In &quot;beyond DNA&quot;, Jones describes these molecules and the many surprises proteins, lipids and even blood now offer. The unexpected persistence of these compounds in proper circumstances reveals an immense amount of data. Animal blood has been taken from stone weapons providing information on prey species. Certain proteins found in blood prove astonishingly persistent, Jones explains. Having mineral attachment properties, these proteins can be found in bones and provide additional dating tools.<br />Plant-related molecules such as silicon &quot;phytoliths&quot; which give grasses a sharp edge and seeds barbs for protection and propagation can provide useful information. These and other indicators are being found in ancient grindstones and stone tools such as scythes. Jones laments the loss of such material from the early days of archaeology when such artefacts were scrupulously cleaned prior to analysis. &quot;Dirty&quot; evidence is proving of immense value in dating and environment of locale.<br />Jones has provided us a compelling account of the annals of molecular analysis in human affairs. Of far greater importance than the history of this discipline are the opportunities for further research. Anyone pondering a career in any one of a number of fields related to the human past would do well to investigate this book. Jones explains that molecular analysis topics range from broad, general themes to individual events. These run from the human diaspora to the murder of the Romanovs. Surely there is something here to interest any budding scholar. Read this for a survey of the options and decide for yourself.

A study of the idea of evolution and consideration of the mechanisms driving it, this book introduces you to the major thinkers and researchers involved.  Each chapter focuses on an individual or a concept, explaining the rationales behind the idea and its supporters.  Larson's evocative prose style keeps the account moving smoothly, even when disputants over an idea grow disruptive and acrimonious.<br />Larson opens with consideration of the problem of deep time.  With biblical authority decreeing a young earth and the immutability of species, the idea of change over time was deemed impossible, if not heretical.  Ironically, the first scholar to open the notion of deep time was one of evolution's &quot;staunchest foes&quot; - Georges Cuvier.  This French scientist was an early expert on comparative anatomy, stressing form resulted from functional use of an organ.  His studies led him to argue that fossils truly represented extinct species.  However, new species didn't evolve from the older ones, he argued, but were the result of an act of subsequent creation. Extinctions were due to some catastrophic event.  The idea of species succession, however,  introduced the notion of deep time - an Earth older than then supposed.<br />From Cuvier, Larson logically moves to the ideas of another French scientist, Jean Baptiste Lamarck.  Today, Lamarck's ideas are blithely dismissed, but Larson shows the significance of his contributions.  Although the paleontological record provided spotty support, Lamarck rejected Cuvier's &quot;fixed species&quot; sequences for a form of continuous change.  Thinking that changes to the body would be reflected in later generations, Lamarck developed the thesis of &quot;acquired characteristics&quot;.  Larson makes clear that Lamarck's ideas, although denounced today, were a needed foundation for Darwin's great insight.<br />Larson's summary of Darwin's Beagle voyage and development of the concept of evolution by natural selection is clear and succinct.  Except for Larson's insistence on calling it  &quot;evolutionism&quot;, thereby changing a scientific idea into an ideology, it's a fine synopsis.  Larson is correct in concentrating on human evolution.  No matter what Darwin wrote of pigeons or barnacles, people wanted to know how humans fit into the evolutionary scheme.  More than one scientific and social issue depended on that pivotal point.<br />Larson describes the years of challenge to natural selection and the rise of Mendelian genetics leading the assault.  Objectors to natural selection came from more than just the ranks of Christian dogmatists.  Lord Kelvin's calculation of the sun's waning heat denied evolution sufficient time to operate.  Others argued that breeding species blended traits instead of separating them into new species.  Later, the most important student of heredity, Thomas Hunt Morgan, rejected natural selection in favour of a mutation-driven mechanism.  The turning point came with J.B.S. Haldane, Sewall Wright and Ronald Fisher's new &quot;biometric&quot; studies in population genetics.  The merging of Mendelian genetics with Darwin's natural selection is now known as the &quot;new synthesis&quot; or &quot;neo-Darwinism&quot;.  That combination has proven the most lasting and meaningful aspect of thought on the idea of evolution.  From it, Larson explains, arose E. O. Wilson's innovative concept of sociobiology.  The behaviour of social insects offer insight into group interaction and are applicable to human evolutionary history.<br />There are many books with information on the history of evolution as a concept.  Why choose this one over any of them?  The main reason is Larson's focus on evolution as an idea.  The biological themes are discussed only briefly, keeping Larson free to relate the history of the concept.  He describes some of the off-shoots of Darwin's original thesis, such asGould and Eldredge's &quot;punctuated equilibrium&quot;, but cautiously avoids any commitment to any of them.  His purpose is relating how the idea came to dominate science.  He also portrays its Christian opponents in the United States and how their strategies have been applied in driving education away from science to embrace religious themes, however disguised.  As an overview, this book is an outstanding introduction.

New, accurate dating systems pinpoint events.  Researchers study humble pollen, weather conditions, changes in household implements along with building construction plans and methods.  Even the \\"dismal science\\" of economics contributes information on trade, surpluses, products exchanged and records.  Documents, always problematic, are subject to intense criticism and comparison.  Inevitably, this investigative array has turned to the eastern Mediterranean and the societies flourishing there in \\"biblical times\\".  During the 19th and early 20th Centuries, scholars rooted in the desert sands seeking evidence that Biblical episodes indeed occurred.  The authors turn that process on its head, accepting the occurrence of events but challenging their dating.  Biblical dating, they argue, is generally contrived.<br /><br />What would be the reason for fabricating excess longevity to the founding of the Jewish people?  According to the authors, it was an attempt by priest-scribes to formulate a theologically-based ideology.  The purpose of this propaganda document was to justify a forced reunification of the \\"dual kingdoms\\" of Israel and Judah, long sundered, but still related.  Instead of a history written over strung out centuries, Finkelstein and Silberman say the authors of the Torah flourished during the 7th Century BCE.  Their intent was to galvanise the people of Judah to participate in the reconquest of Israel.<br /><br />As the biblical writers put it, David founded a glorious kingdom, further enhanced by Solomon.  This empire was centred on the Temple in Jerusalem.  A centralised dogma with adherence to a single deity [no matter how capricious] represented by a single building in a central city was the rallying point.  The Torah, then, was little more than a manifesto for conquest and unification.  Past failures and successful invasions by Egyptians, Assyrians and Persians were attributed to idolatry, intermarriage with foreign women and rejection of YHWH, the all-powerful desert god.  Finkelstein and Silberman credit the biblical authors with manipulating, if not fabricating past events to build the case for Jewish unity.<br /><br />The book's authors bring every tool in archaeology's kit to bear in constructing their case.  Each chapter opens with a \\"biblical account\\" of periods and events.  The archaeological evidence is then presented for comparison.  The Exodus, for example, a Jewish foundation stone of tradition and celebration, lacks all support.  The Egyptians, meticulous record-keepers, say nothing of large Hebrew slave populations.  Pharonic border guardians, ever alert to invasions from the east, apparently missed half a million people crossing the other way.  The great infrastructure projects attributed to Solomon were more likely to have come from the despised Omride dynasty of Samaria.  The evidence derives from gate construction techniques.  Even business makes a contribution - it was Judah's rise in commerce that improved its level of literacy.  A more learned population was more susceptible to the wave of propaganda insisting Israel and Judah should be reunited.<br /><br />Finkelstein and Silberman avoid sinking into the morass of \\"biblical minimalism\\" prevalent in recent years.  They don't contest the \\"historical reality\\" of biblical events.  They do insist on better evidence for chronology, and for realistic assessment of the power of Jewish leaders.  David couldn't have ruled more than a minuscule kingdom and nobody seems to have heard of Solomon.  The authors acknowledge the long-term impact of the Torah and its successors in the Christian world.  The reason, they argue, is that no other theological or political documents of the time reached so many people so intimately.  Greeks, Persians, Egyptians and Babylonians all produced their commentators.  None of these, however, could prescribe the daily lives of their readers.  The Hebrew Bible's writer's provided this and other guides with a surety of purpose other societies never matched.  It proved an effective, if historically flawed, document.

The former method is often ponderous, the latter often misleading.  Menocal has opted for the second option.  In her survey of Medieval Spain, she gives us an entertaining and informative look at expressions of the intellectual elite over seven centuries of Muslim rule.<br />Menocal's approach aims to restore Spanish Islam's blemished reputation.  Muslim Spain has endured a scathing censure imposed by &quot;victorious&quot; Christian Europe.  In the Christian view, the Reconquista of Spain freed a population from a Muslim yoke.  The European invasion of the Western Hemisphere carried that myth across the Atlantic while strengthening the crusading attitude of the conquistadores.  Menocal uses romantic poetry, the advancement of selected scholars to high posts under the caliphate, and the literacy of the Muslim and Jewish communities as evidence of high, positive interaction.  Even the Christians, normally disdainful of literacy, science and philosophy, joined the chorus of common interests.<br />Weaving her tale around the Cordovan Umayyad caliphs founded by exiled prince Abn al-Rahmad, she traces the building programs, internal disputes among the Islamic schisms arising along the Mediterranean, and the challenges posed by intruders from the north.  For Menocal, the binding force across Islamic Spain was language.  Arabic became a lingua franca with the power to transcend religious dogma and jurisdictional disputes.  Jews and Christians alike became fluent in this imposed language due to its expressive power.  Arabic was also used in the Eastern Mediterranean to recover and spread lost texts of the Greek scholars.  Thus, often unattributed, the Muslims kept medicine, astronomy, philosophy and other disciplines alive.  Christians would later adapt them joyfully, but the Dark Ages aren't misnamed for the rest of Western Europe.<br />Menocal might have produced a book of sweeping vision, restoring the image of Muslim Spain as one of civilisation's most noteworthy achievements.  Instead, she sinks into a swamp of romantic fervour, highlighting erotic poetry and grandiose architecture.  The farmers and small traders who were taxed to support these elitist endeavours likely had a different view.  That is, when they weren't in hiding from the nearly continuous wars waged among the Muslims or between the Islamic invaders from the south or the Christian ones from across the Pyrenees.<br />As she skips over the centuries, Menocal introduces the rising tide of Christian aggressive attitudes culminating in the Jewish/Muslim expulsion.  The French monastics at Cluny had adopted the liberal view of philosophy espoused by their Iberian neighbours.  Deeper in Europe, however, the Cistercians, ardent crusaders, urged expunging Christianity of any Arabic taint.  Viewpoints hardened, as Menocal recounts, through exchanges of essays and books.  Menocal doesn't investigate whether these expressions reached the general populace, but the Church hierarchy system ensured local parish priests acted as mouthpieces of the regional bishops.  The events of 1492 verified who had the louder voice.<br />Although tentatively concluding with the background of Columbus' departure, Menocal cannot resist extending her recital to the early 17th Century.  How can one write on Spain without folding the La Manchan epic into the story?  Finding Arabic roots in Cervantes is neither new nor difficult, but Menocal provides a new twist.  Menocal suggests Don Quixote's worldview is that of any thinker of the Muslim period.  Identity of any aspect of the world is muddled by a spread of conflicting, if not hostile, attitudes.  La Mancha thus becomes the last gasp of an integrated Spanish society that is considered insane by the rigid-minded world that succeeded it.<br />Given the span of time and involvement of numerous articulate historical figures, one turns  to the &quot;Other Readings&quot; at the back with high expectation.  Turn the pages carefully, otherwise you'll miss it.  Instead of a bibliography rich in selection, there are a few translations by Menocal's lady friends and a few, little known scholars of the subject.

The usual flaws are oversimplification, errors of omission or outdated information. This book exhibits few of these problems, with the possible exception of the last. The rapid progress being attained in paleoanthropology these dates edges the \\"most recent finds\\" boundary almost monthly. We can't fault Robin McKie for falling behind as his frequent columns in The Guardian allow for prompt updating of the material. In this presentation, McKie has made a valiant effort to summarise the most recent information gathered on the nature of our ancestors. His fine prose is supported by some excellent, some good and some almost pitiful graphics. Fortunately, McKie's narrative more than transcends any shortcomings in the visuals.<br />Human evolution remains the most important scientific topic. Its significance is reflected in the many controversies associated with paleoanthropology. McKie doesn't shy away from these disputes. In fact, he nearly makes them the underlying theme of the book. He follows the revelations about our forebears offered by Raymond Dart, the Leakey family [which has proven a true dynasty in its own right], Don Johanson, Alan Walker and numerous others. Each made contributions, sometimes hotly contested by fellow researchers looking at the same data from different perspectives. McKie is good at examining the views and the evidence supporting them. He follows debates and resolutions closely, leaving the reader well informed and generally convinced by the resolution he selects.<br />McKie has a fine sense of the issues surrounding excavations and the analysis of revealed data. He explains the dating methods used in properly placing our ancestors on the evolutionary timeline. The evidence demonstrates that a strictly linear progression of human ancestry is difficult or impossible to draw from existing fossil specimens. McKie shows how many of the pre-human species branched off to become \\"failed\\" evolutionary experiments. The picture that emerges he equates with \\"the bar in Star Wars\\" in which many different types co-exist and intermingle while remaining unique. He returns to this image frequently which might become supportive of the \\"multi-regional\\" hypothesis. This idea, that Homo sapiens developed in parallel in different parts of the world, contested for some time with Darwin's proposal that humanity emerged in Africa. McKie, after examining all the arguments and data, declares that Darwin \\"got it right\\" all those years ago.<br />With the resources available, McKie has enlivened his text with excellent illustrations. There are diagrams and photographs of fossils as found and reconstructed. Several good maps of fossil sites and likely routes taken by our wandering ancestors. The only flaw in these images are hazy reproductions of the TV production. Most of these portray our ancestors as hirsute savannah dwellers, an image dispelled by Don Johanson's artist a generation ago. As an overview account, the reading list is brief - too brief, given McKie's qualifications. Even so, this book is an excellent starting point for learning about our evolutionary heritage.<br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]ome \\"failed\\" evolutionary experiments.

The next time you're setting up a putt on the ninth hole at Smoky Hill Country Club in Hays, Kansas, pause a moment.  Glance around you at the arid hills and scattered vegetation.  It's difficult to comprehend that where you're standing was once under hundreds of metres of sea water.  Millions of years in the past most of what is now central North America lay beneath the great Niobrara Sea [better known as the Bear Paw Sea].  Nor would you feel lonely - it was inhabited by all manner of creatures.  However, some of these rivalled in size and ferocity the great land-dwelling dinosaurs of the same period.  Richard Ellis has started to fill a long-standing gap in revealing how these creatures likely lived.  And perhaps why they are no longer with us.<br />Ancient marine reptiles developed to immense sizes and bizarre shapes.  Ellis focusses on the four major types, all of which had one commonalty - size.  After a brief lesson on nomenclature and a dismissal of the Loch Ness enigma, he goes on to introduce us to some true monsters.  And gargantuan they are!  The fossils found in Britain and Belgium almost two centuries ago amazed the world with their likely size.  Those revealed since, many from around Hays, Kansas, achieve lengths of up to twenty metres.  In line with their massive bodies, some bore impressive dental equipment, with some teeth achieving twenty centimetres in length.  Seeking prey at depth, they developed eyes the size of dinner plates.  These were formidable creatures, indeed.<br />Ellis compiles fossil evidence to develop a picture of marine reptile lifestyles.  They were all predators, but shape, locomotion and capacity for diving to extreme depths combined to focus on particular niches.  Some must have been a glorious sight [if they didn't see you!], literally &quot;flying&quot; through the water like penguins.  Others undulated their bodies like snakes, although, as Ellis states, no snakes were present in the seas at the time.  The ichthyosaurs seem to have resembled tunas in shape and motion.  The most extraordinary were the long-necked plesiosaurs who may have been bottom feeders.  The range of body types and swimming styles is a reflection of the long period of their dominance.  They were successful enough to have occupied the full extent of the world's oceans of the time.<br />There are a few quirks in this book the general reader should note.  These reptiles maintained an imposing set of food processors and there's a challenge in demonstrating many factors in but one illustration.  As Ellis notes often, how they appeared and how they lived relies much on what they ate.  But, unlike the many illustrations he provides for dramatic effect, they didn't cruise the seas mouths agape.  That's for fish with gills, not air-breathing reptiles.  There's some irony in the illustration [p. 212] depicting a mosasaur swimming closed-mouthed, but bending its neck in a manner no large reptile with only seven vertebrae could achieve.  These are, of course, minor issues and detract little from Ellis presentation.  Still, as a learning resource for the non-paleontologists among us, it was incumbent on Ellis to use his wealth of information accurately.

The Uncertain Science of Global Warming	Books	5	11	14	N	N	A &quot;risky business&quot;	If you retain any doubts about whether the atmosphere around us is warming, this book will dispel them.  George Philander has produced the most complete study yet of climate mechanics and trends.  His theme is the complexity of the global weather systems.  With three decades of experience teaching the subject, he understands these intricate systems.  He knows each part must be dealt with individually.  Although derived from a series of lectures, he rises above a purely pedantic approach in presenting the issues.  He's fully aware that human-induced factors in climate change can be modified only by those same humans.  Although containing a wealth of detail, the book is directed at the general reader.  It's an indispensable starting point in learning about climate and global warming.<br />In coping with the many interacting elements that must be addressed in assessing global warming, he begins at the fundamental level.  Once any form of atmosphere is in place, what does light do in generating change?  No atmosphere merely sits in place - light drives chemical and temperature changes.  What changes take place, and how severe, great or minimal, can they be?  This is the &quot;uncertain science&quot; Philander uses to subtitle the book.  Because interactions of light, water vapour and various molecules react differently, he cautions the reader and his fellow scientists not to arrive at conclusions without making fully comprehensive assessments.  It is too easy, he cautions, to draw conclusions through focussing on one or a few players in the climate drama.  Ignored or dismissed factors are likely to hold surprises.  The biggest surprise, of course, is a scenario that proves false.<br />With global warming universally accepted, with only the pace and impact in dispute, Philander's book is a welcome summary of the science.  His style is neither alarmist nor overly detached from the issues.  The balance keeps the book readable.  He even banishes most of the mathematical explanations to Appendices at the back of the book.  The text is enhanced by highly effective graphics.  The theme of uncertainty is introduced early in the book with an image of a skier's wallet skidding down a slope.  &quot;Moguls&quot; of heaped snow make the wallet's track unpredictable - a point referred to frequently in the narrative.  He images the way<br />mountains affect rain patterns, how globe-girdling oceanic currents move and what happens in the deep seas as fresh, salt, cold and warm waters interact.  Anyone still thinking the oceans are simply beds of salty water should look here.<br />Although Philander's style is understated, he leaves no doubt as to the seriousness of the problem.  The atmosphere is warming.  Whether humanity initiated the current cycle is irrelevant.  We are aggravating it and only we can reduce our impact.  We are unlikely to curb the El Nino cycles, but we can learn to better cope with them.  We can also reduce the likelihood of their growing more intense.  Philander cites the case of fluorocarbons and the Antarctic Ozone Hole.  An accord led to reduction in those gases, new accords can reduce or eliminate production of others clogging the atmosphere.  Global warming, he says, is a &quot;risky business&quot;.  It's up to us to reduce the risk.  Read this book and find out how.

Why do men fight over apparent inconsequentials? Is rape a \\"natural\\" and \\"sex-driven\\" event, or merely the consequence of human cultural demands? These questions and a host of others are addressed in this superb survey of primate behaviour studies. Ever since Jane Goodall discovered chimpanzees sought colobus monkeys for dinner treats, new studies of primates have revealed arresting behaviour patterns. Like humans, other primates murder, rape and even make war. The authors have scoured a wealth of primate studies to derive a picture of our heritage. They suggest we learn what our cousins do in order to better understand what we do. Otherwise, we will continue to make bad decisions based on flawed assumptions.<br />Our fellow primates are avid territorialists, argue the authors. Borders unseen by us are clearly delineated by chimpanzees, orangutans and monkeys. These defined areas are hotly defended. The other side of the coin produces invasions. Opportunism, failing resources, or just spite, drives chimpanzee groups to stealthily scout and enter another band's range. Rarely, an individual will stage a foray, but only if he thinks success likely. Too often, the raids appear to have no particular purpose. A sally may lead to injuries or even death, but the attacking troop is just as likely to withdraw to its original range with neither captives nor booty. What prompts these seemingly mindless assaults? Are they inevitable among primates?<br />The latter question was answered, according to the authors, with the discovery of the \\"pygmy chimpanzee\\" or bonobo. This species contrasts sharply with its common chimpanzee cousins, who live in bands beset by tension. Common chimpanzees may raid other groups, but \\"back home\\" the hierarchical structure leads to internal conflict. Raids on other groups may vent some aggravation, but it's the struggle for dominance that rules common chimp behaviour. Bonobos, by contrast, use sex to resolve their social conflicts. Bisexual and same sex couplings are common and frequent. With no hierarchy to climb, males need not struggle for dominance. Although a senior female may wield some authority, even her \\"rules\\" are imparted by selected groomings or couplings with aggressors.<br />Bonobos are late arrivals on the evolutionary stage, having split off from the chimpanzee line after chimps and humans diverged from their common ancestor. Humans tended in some ways toward chimpanzee behaviour, toward bonobos in other aspects. Male dominance and most aspects of male violence stem from similarities to our nearest cousins, the chimps, say the authors. They stress that most human violence is rooted in our volutionary past. Although they're prompt to deny that this foundation cannot be overcome, they stress that we must understand these roots in order to make better decisions. Most significantly, they argue, we must shed the mythology of violence as a cultural artefact. This will be a difficult step for many, but it must be taken.

The concept of parallel universes is a powerful literary contrivance.  It allows an author to indiscriminately devise characters, circumstances and mechanisms not allowed in mainstream fiction.  Inventive abilities are the only restraining element.  Fforde fully displays his inventive talents in this fantasy of a world dominated by literature and its characters.  Setting the story in a alternate 20th Century Britain, he provides a familiar scene.  The familiarity is disrupted by unusual events - like a &quot;temporal anomaly&quot; appearing on a country road.  British imperialist ambitions haven't been shed, but they're confined to the Russian Crimea where a war has peristed for over a century.  All this becomes necessary background in a story of a LitCop striving to protect the reputations and products of British writers.<br />Literature is held in high regard in this tale - that alone should recommend this book.  Authors are memorised in this society.  Books discussed and debated, characters assessed, true authorship is argued over when the merest hint of alternatives presents itself.  Inevitably, the issue of who actually wrote Shakespeare's works consumes substantial space in this book.  Societies form to debate the issue, taking to the streets or vandalising when milder forms of assertion fail.  As a SpecialOps agent, Thursday Next is caught up in much of this, but her true role is that of combatting Evil.  Evil, of course, is personified in a former teacher of Thursday's, Archeron Hades - &quot;a lech&quot;.  Thus, with one phrase, the protagonists are identified and innocent womanhood is threatened by male dominance.  Even Harry Potter tales don't  portray as starkly as this.  But Harry Potter is written for children -  who are more critical.<br />Archeon is the archetypical - whell, not &quot;mad scientist&quot; - let's say &quot;mad scholar&quot;.  There's a bit of &quot;world domination&quot; in his thinking, but mostly he's interesting in pulling off the coup having the most impact.  After a rehearsive heist of one manuscript, he goes after The Big One, the Kohinoor of British literature - Jane Eyre.  If he scores this, he can manipulate every copy of the book ever printed.  Then what?  Enter the other giant figure - Goliath Corporation - which, like all powerful businesses in today's world, has lost sight of the dividing line between commerce and government.  The Crimea has become THE icon of British power and must be retained.  What could two such monumental forces of Evil not achieve working together?  Especially given that Goliath's representative is named Jack Schitt.<br />Thursday, who has lost a brother in the Crimea and a fiance to her work, opens the story  by losing two colleagues to Hades in a botched arrest attempt.  Hades has &quot;special powers&quot; granting him the ability to steal undetected and escape in a variety of disguises.  For a resident of a society supposedly steeped in literature, some of Thursday's gaffes are more than just perplexing.  Examples abound that she might draw upon, but it would curtail the tale.  She perserveres, and the path to the climax isn't overly complicated.  The solution to overcoming Hades' bizaare powers is jarring in its irrelevancy, but we have to forgive Fforde for running out of inventiveness here.  He's used up so much getting to this point.<br />Fforde's literary knowledge is impressive.  He works in many points and debates, even if they have to be inserted forcefully.  He pushes people into text and pulls them out into &quot;reality&quot; with real aplomb.  If you're not into Victorian Literature, Fforde kindly weaves plots and characters from it into this story.  Thursday recounts &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; for her distracted partner, and the Shakespeare debates are given full airing.  Fforde's style makes the presentation tolerable, which reading the original cannot.  It is that ability with language that overcomes what might be serious shortcomings in this book.  Don't read it to pick apart the implausible events or stereotyped characters - read it to enjoy Fforde's talent as a writer.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]ook.

Income from clients isn't matching costs of operations.  Even the merging of facilities by moving the Agency to the site of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors and elevating Mma Grace Makutsi to Assistant Manager [along with her already being Assistant Detective] hasn't increased the cash flow.  Now, in the midst of business and personal crises, a new detective agency is established in Gaborone.  It's run, of course, by  [shudder!] a man!  And what a man!  Cephas Buthelezi is a name commanding respect.  Whether this man is an inheritor of Zulu traditional power and deserves deference remains to be seen.  Will he corral all of the Ladies' Detective Agency's potential clients?<br />Compounding the business stress are the personal issues.  Precious Ramotswe, founder of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, has become a foster parent of two orphans.  The girl, confined to a wheelchair, has been subjected to schoolmate taunting.  Her brother has developed new and disturbing behaviour, typified by the killing of a hoopoe bird, unheard of in Botswana.  Beyond the children's problems is the ongoing, but not fulfilled, engagement of Precious and Mr J.L.B. Matekone.  Will they ever wed?<br />More to the point of this tale is Mma Makutsi's spinsterhood.  As the highest scoring graduate of her typing school, McCall Smith makes her more intellectual than desirable.  Yet these very attributes should make her a prime catch for men following Botswanan tradition.  And in Mma Makutsi the author shows how these traditions should be respected.  Although her &quot;typing school for men&quot; [using ten used typewriters] is created to help the issue of cash flow, is there a more subliminal motive?  As it happens, much of the story pivots on this question.<br />There is, as there must be, a &quot;case&quot; to be solved.  As with all McCall Smith's tales of Mma Ramotswe's business, it departs from any typical mystery novel.  A hesitant man calls on her services with a special requirement.  There was a crime, perhaps two, but it was long ago.  The victims may not be alive or perhaps far away.  Precious is charged with finding them for a unique resolution to long distant events.  As always, she rises to challenge with common sense, a bit of personality manipulation, and effective negotiation.  As always, she does it all with tact, forbearance and skill, leaving none hurt or regretful.<br />McCall Smith's narrative skills in weaving events and characters have few peers.  Although it's doubtful Precious Ramotswe is a &quot;typical&quot; Botswanan, she's a character worth emulating.  The author follows the modern pattern of making men either arrogant or weak, but that, unfortunately, drives sales these days.  Perhaps when Mr J.L.B. Matekone emerges from his doldrums, McCall Smith will be able to restore some balance.  One hopes it doesn't take too many books to achieve that.

The author follows the modern pattern of making men either arrogant or weak, but that, unfortunately, drives sales these days.  Perhaps when Mr J.L.B. Matekone emerges from his doldrums, McCall Smith will be able to restore some balance.  One hopes it doesn't take too many books to achieve that.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]	2004-04-18

The evidence supporting this stance comes from archaeological finds in places like the Tigris-Euphrates Valley [Iraq], Jericho [Palestine] and Catul Hayak in Turkey.  In these places grain storage facilities bespeak intense cereals agriculture.  Surplus grain production and distribution techniques suggest social hierarchy, fluent communication and new approaches to the environment.  The standard view stumbles a bit in how knowledge of farming spread to remote places like Central America.  It's  also silent on why isolated peoples like Aborigines in Australia failed to adopt &quot;domestic&quot; farming methods.<br />Tudge wants a fresh assessment - starting with a proper definition of &quot;farming&quot;.  By his definition, &quot;farming&quot; is simply any modification of an environment supporting edible resources.  &quot;Modification&quot; ranges from protecting a known resource from predation to diverting water to stimulate growth.  There are no &quot;fields&quot; dedicated to crop production - the sites were opportunistic finds.  Tudge here raises the point overlooked by most scholars -&quot;farming&quot; began at the end of the last Ice Age.  The best crop sites were low-lying stream valleys containing rich soils and available water.  As the glaciers melted and sea levels rose, these locations were inundated and lost to research.  The Middle Eastern &quot;burst&quot; of agrarian development was due to a dislocated population that had already practiced farming elsewhere.  The Tigris-Euphrates was an exile.<br />Neither, Tudge argues, will we find paddocks for domestic animals in the early locations.  In Tudge's view animal domestication began by selecting those animals amenable to human contact.  Continuous association evoked genetic changes in these creatures until domestication became the norm.  Nor were the keepers of goats, sheep and other small animals necessarily constant in the practice.  Tudge notes a South African people who keep goats for some years, then abandon them for a spate of hunting.<br />He also insists on a Darwinian perspective on farming and pastoralism's origins.  The &quot;sudden&quot; outburst of Middle Eastern agriculture violates the Darwinian process by obscuring earlier evidence.  Like any evolutionary process, each step is slow, hesitant and scattered in time and place.  Success builds on success until a new pattern is firmly established.  Farming and pastoralism emerged  in steps, but once established, it became an irreversible process.  Agriculture produces not only excess crops, but excess population to consume them.  Extra land is needed to supply the new population - and the cycle repeats.  This surge in population of modern humans due to agriculture , Tudge contends, was the death knell of the Neanderthals.  With Tudge's form of farming originating forty thousand years ago, modern humans outproduced the Neanderthals in both population and resource dominance.<br />This slim volume proposes many innovative and challenging ideas.  Tudge is on solid ground in negating the &quot;abrupt flowering&quot; of modern humans and agriculture in the Middle East.  He rightly argues for simpler beginnings of such a complex process.  This is an important book in an important series.  Tudge's excellent prose skills make this small book a delight to read.

Sometimes, though, getting from a suburban home to the wilderness he relishes can be tedious.  So he brought some of his favoured Sonoran Desert environment to his front yard.  Using a ramshackle Kubota tractor, he stripped away the layer of Bermuda grass surrounding his house.  Over time, and with no little effort, he transformed that yard into a little pocket of desert environment.  All this was more than an exercise in redecorating, however.  Alcock studies insects, especially their mating rituals, and this transplanted environment gave him ample opportunity.  Even if his practice of crouching over desert shrubbery at odd hours raised a few neighbourhood eyebrows.<br />Alcock loves what he does, imparting his passion to us with lively prose.  His academic background merges with his expressions of feeling to keep this book a delight to read.  This blending places his writing skills in a comfortable [and comforting] niche somewhere between E. O. Wilson and John McPhee or David Quammen.  He keeps you at ease as he builds the desert floor, inserts shrubbery and vegetables, and welcomes the bird and insect visitors to his creation.  He protects the native species of plants and animals where possible, but doesn't summarily reject harmless exotics.  And he carefully explains how to tell the difference.<br />The underlying reason for the garden's transformation was to attract insects.  Alcock is at his best in watching, analysing and explaining the life styles of desert bees, wasps, beetles and the rest.  How did they develop those behaviours?  What do their activities it mean to us humans, who are too often ardently killing the ones in our own gardens.  He poses his questions with the puzzlement of fresh discovery.  Then, adroitly picking through the available evidence - while calling out for further studies - he sifts through the optional answers to deliver the most likely, and most logical scenario.  Yet, at no point are you being &quot;lectured to&quot;.  Instead, you are introduced to some of the awesome array of variation nature offers.  This is no specialist's daunting lecture, but the confessions of a man who finds wonder in small things.  It's also, of course, an example for any reader to enter his own yard to consider restoring it some state of origins instead of developer's artificiality.<br />Alcock's view of his environment isn't wholly without concerns, however.  There's no question of his concern for the impact of unrestricted &quot;development&quot;.  Phoenix, the urban hub of his home in Tempe, is one of the fastest growing cities in the US.  With reconstructed landscapes, imported species, proliferating golf courses and a staggering consumption of water, this emblem of &quot;progress&quot; is another urban blight on the landscape.  Alcock is uncomfortable with this situation, but nearly helpless to block it.  His example of bringing some of the countryside into the city and restoring a bit of balance at a time is an example we should all consider carefully.  His book's photo collection will make every gardener smile knowingly.  The illustrations portray the object of his studies.  With this combination he has produced an example of what a single individual [with some spousal support] can achieve, and told us all about it in this fine book.

It's become a party cliche to comment on our need for the results of combining a poisonous gas [chlorine] and a volatile metal [sodium].  Kurlansky passes quickly over such levity to seriously relate the role of sodium chloride in human society.  While at first glance his account may seem overdone, a bit of reflection reveals that something so common in our lives is easily overlooked.  Salt is essential to our existence.  Our need is so strong and enduring that we tend to take its availability for granted.  As a global history, this book is an ambitious attempt to re-introduce us to something we think common and uninteresting.  It's immensely successful through Kurlansky's multi-faceted approach.  He combines economics, politics, culinary practices, tradition and myth in making his presentation.  About the only aspect ignored is the detailed biological one explaining why this compound is so necessary to our existence.<br />Because our need for salt is so fundamental, its history encompasses that of humanity.  Salt was basic to many economies, Kurlansky notes.  It's acted as the basis of exchange between traders, was the target of empire builders and even paid out to soldiers as a form of &quot;salary&quot; - hence the term.  Venice, a coastal city tucked away from the main tracks of Mediterranean trade, bloomed into prominence when it discovered it could garner more profit by trading in salt than by manufacturing it.  The Venetian empire and later renaissance was founded on the salt trade.<br />Empires may be built on salt, but can be felled by misguided policies on its trade and consumption.  One element leading to the downfall of the French monarchy was the hated &quot;gabelle&quot;, or salt tax, which imposed a heavier burden on farming peasants than it did on the aristocracy.  The reputation of tax evasion borne by the French relates to the resentment expressed over the salt tax.  A British regulation on salt resulted in similar reaction leading to the breakup up their own Empire.  It was a &quot;march to the sea&quot; led by Mahatma Ghandi to collect salt that galvanised resistance to British rule.  Over a century after the French Revolution, the British were displaced from India for similar reasons - greed.<br />While acknowledging the importance of salt in our lives, Kurlansky notes that determining how much is &quot;too little&quot; or &quot;too much&quot; is elusive.  Many people today claim to have &quot;salt-free&quot; diets while remaining ignorant of how much salt is contained in our foods, both naturally and through processing.  Yet, as Kurlansky records, salt has appeal beyond just the body's needs.  He records numerous commentators from ancient Egypt, China and Rome who express their admiration for salt's flavour-adding qualities.  Sauces based on various ingredients mixed with salt permeate the book.  He notes that the salt dispenser is a modern innovation, supplementing the use of salt in cooking processes.<br />Salt's decline in conserving food, which changed the amount of salt we consume directly, came about due to increased world trade, displacement of rural populations into cities, and, of course, war.  &quot;The first blow&quot; displacing salt as a preservative came from a Parisian cook; a man so obscure that his given name remains disputed.  Nicolas [Francois?] Appert worked out how to preserve meat by &quot;canning&quot;.  Adopted by Napoleon's armies, the technique spread rapidly.  The technology of the Industrial Revolution led to effective refrigeration.  Kurlansky gives an account of Clarence Birdseye's efforts to found what became a major industry.<br />Although the topic seems overspecialised, the universal application and long historical view of this book establishes its importance.  Kurlansky has successfully met an immense challenge in presenting a wealth of information.  That he graces what might have been a dry pedantic exercise with recipes, anecdotes, photographs and maps grants this bookwide appeal.  He's to be congratulated for his worldly view and comprehensive presentation.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]wide appeal.

With our meat available today in shrink-wrapped containers it's easy to lose sight of that long-standing tradition.  Others in the world still obtain meat in the traditional environment.  The difference is that instead of spears, the weapons are high-powered shotguns.  Instead of skulking through the forest seeking prey, hunters are now given rides by timber carriers using deep-penetrating access roads.  In this book, Dale Peterson reveals the transformations forest hunting has undergone in West African nations.  It's not a<br />pleasing picture, but it's valid and it's important.  And it must change.<br />The bushmeat trade has many implications, but Peterson has chosen three significant ones.  One, of course, is that by killing chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas for food, we're consuming our nearest relations.  The primate line divided only 12 million years ago, with the descendants of one line becoming today's mountain gorillas.  The other line led to chimpanzees and bonobos with a spur turning off about 7 million years ago leading to you and me.  The proximity of chimpanzee and human DNA patterns is no longer news, but the reminder needs to be flashed occasionally.<br />Another implication is health.  With so much attention given to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, it's worth reflecting on its origins.  More importantly, as Peterson reminds us, is to consider how it works.  HIV/AIDS appears to be a recent evolutionary virus quirk.  It adapts and evolves with amazing speed.  The roots of it remain in the African forest and a new strain can emerge at any time.  The best means of transmission from ape or monkey to human is through blood - that stuff the hunter is soaked in as he butchers his forest kill.<br />The third theme is the question of human relations with the rest of our environment.  Human population growth is presented in a novel framework.  How many humans come into existence every day is contrasted with the great ape population.  Peterson calculates that the entire gorilla population is equalled by new humans every twelve hours.  Population pressures in the &quot;developed&quot; world lead to demands for African timber products.  In turn, the timber firms are cutting great swaths of forest using displaced populations for labour.  To feed these workers, hunters are hired or loggers hunt and apes, due to their availability and size, become a major food source.  In a feedback cycle of habitat reduction and hunting, the apes are simply being exterminated.  Recovery would require sharply reduced logging.  Peterson notes that trees are being taken that began growth in Michaelangelo's time, but their replacements will be cut in only forty years.<br />Peterson is effusive in his description of the significant role played by Swiss photographer Karl Ammann.  Ammann's chance encounter with a logging truck driver revealed the role international logging firms play in the ape slaughter and the extended bushmeat trade.  The logging firms, particularly CIB,  contend they are providing &quot;employment for locals, health services, food and education&quot;.  Peterson explains the falsity of this contention, with &quot;health services limited to a nurse and schools and teachers paid for by the workers' families.<br />Peterson argues that the long-established bushmeat tradition is already lost, displaced by commercial logging practices and new, mass hunting methods using guns, sometimes lent by government officials.  If we can change a culture, such as was done with slavery, hunting traditions no longer tenable can be modified, as well.  He cites the willingness of Americans to spend minimal annual funds to protect wolves, bears and other fauna.  Why not establish a fund for ape protection.  He calculates that US$1 billion per year could be raised with an individual contribution of but US$50.  Not an enormous sum, given that other donations and military expenditures far exceed it.

This book is among the more sweeping efforts aspiring to reveal who we are.  Fossils of our ancestors are being revealed at an increasing rate.  From these scattered bones and teeth [and a few artefacts], a more complete picture of our evolutionary path is emerging.  The evidence from the bones is being complemented by genetic studies filling in the details of human migration over the planet.  If nothing else has been derived from these multi-disciplinary studies, our ancient origins in Africa is now undisputed, say the authors.<br />There's another element almost hidden away by the growing amount of evidence.  What kind of path did hominid species follow in becoming human?  That question forms the basis of Klein and Edgar's &quot;bold new theory&quot; clamouring from the cover.  They contend the fossil and genetic evidence displays human evolution as a series of long, slack stretches of development, both physical and mental, interrupted by bursts of innovation in body and brain.  Each burst, building on what had gone on before, seems to them a form of the &quot;great leap forward&quot;.  They contend the evidence in bones, especially skulls, indicates spurts of brain encephalisation.  This means not only larger brains, but more elaborate ones - capable of complex thoughts, foresight, enhanced communication skills and symbolism - in short, culture.  Although the bones and skulls are geographically scattered and the art and artefacts few and far between, the authors contend they have drawn the path of human development clearly and conclusively.  Human evolution followed a path of long stretches of equilibrium, punctuated by episodes of rapid change.<br />&quot;Punctuated&quot;?  &quot;Equilibrium&quot;?  The authors concede early in the book that this isn't an original idea with them.  It's derived from the attention-seeking proposal of Stephen Gould and Niles Eldredge a generation ago.  &quot;Punk eek&quot; keeps struggling for survival and the road of human evolution is its sole remaining support.  There's a delicious irony in this, given Steve Gould's ambivalent attitude toward human evolution.  Ostrich eggshell beads are intriguing, but far less important than how we developed hunting strategies.  Rock tools and stick weapons are features we share with our chimpanzee relatives - a notion &quot;punk eekers find distasteful.<br />Klein's bringing Blake Edgar's writing talents to this book was inspired thinking.  What Edgar granted to Don Johanson in clarity he has duplicated here.  Combining his prose skills with Klein's wealth of illustrative material and wide knowledge of the discipline has produced a cogent, readable text.  Unfortunately, Edgar's campaign strategy of inserting Gould into the scenario is less compelling.  The theory is thus neither &quot;bold&quot; nor &quot;new&quot;.  How significant it is in describing the human condition awaits more evidence than is currently available.  Given that so much of it rests on brain development, real data is unlikely to be forthcoming. However, it's worth waiting for.  Pass the time delving into the wealth of information in this book.

Although many words have been written attempting to show the unity of the human species, Steve Olson makes yet another attempt.  He feels the need is there to be met.  Instead of basing his effort on philosophical or moral grounds, he turns to our genetic record to make his point.  It's a valid quest using unimpeachable methods and Olson presents it well.  Some of the material, such as Wilson and Cann's \\"mitochondrial Eve\\" may be a bit shopworn, but it's an essential element of Olson's scenario.  He builds his structure carefully and solidly, so a bit of used material isn't out of place.  After all, he's not attempting any new, revolutionary concept in this book.  He merely wishes to displace old, traditional ideas with a new reality.<br />Given the entrenched thinking about \\"race\\" in human cultures, calling Olson's task daunting is grievous understatement.  The human diaspora from Africa he traces reaches across 150 millennia.  Unlike most other species, humanity developed at an astonishing rate.  Tracing genetic changes with humans migrating across the planet, not always in one direction is staggeringly difficult.  Olson struggles, usually successfully, to reconcile the paleoanthropological finds with genetics research.  He demonstrates the likely origins of the Chinese, Europeans, Australian and Western Hemispheric Aborigines.  One subset of our species, the Jews, receives some special attention.<br />Olson recognises that much of the information he addresses is \\"highly contentious\\", but he bravely sets out to reconcile the views of many researchers.  He examines in some detail, for example, hotly disputed notions about linguistic evolution.  Given that the human population at the beginnings of language was already \\"on the road\\", his own description of language origins seems a bit thin.  It would be unfair to fault him for this section, however, particularly since his aim isn't to prove or disprove any of the theories, but to use linguistic evolution as a metaphor.  A full analysis of the topics in historical linguistics would double the size of the book.  Readers interested in the topic should start with Olson's bibliography and keep reading.<br />Does Olson succeed in his quest?  With the advances made in genetic analysis over the past generation, the origin of our species in Africa is now beyond dispute.  Whether there's been enough time for local populations to form genetically distinct sub-species of Homo sapiens, Olson deftly refutes.  There's been far too much intermingling and interbreeding to establish the kinds of races birds have done.  That cultural ties keep groups with some identifiable physical traits such as the epicanthic folds of some Asian peoples doesn't justify labelling them with racial identities.  A broadening of marriage traditions would quickly blend out the trait, as it already has in some areas.<br />Olson has performed a monumental task in defining our species. He covers the globe over an immense time span.  He traces, as best he can with current evidence, the various tracks our ancestors took in occupying the planet.  There's little doubt he's built a solid case for our identity as a single, if widespread, species. He helps his theme with some useful maps and other diagrams.  Clearly our common ancestor denies the notion of \\"separate races\\".<br />On the other hand, why did he feel the need to make this effort.  Clearly, \\"race\\", whether or not biologically valid, is a strong element in human thinking.  Why this should be doesn't appear to be something we can identify through genetic analysis.  The cause is ultimately, as Olson tentatively concedes, cultural.  Bring up your children to hate someone identifiable, and they likely will do so.  In Hawaii, likely the planet's most ethnically blended society, intermarriage, mixed schools and churches and full job opportunity, still has not shed divisions among its people.  Olson would like his book to help overcome those divisions.  It isn't likely tohappen unless every human alive reads this book.  And accepts his conclusions.

Global warming, so clearly impacted, if not driven, by humanity is leading to greater acceptance of the interaction of weather and society.  Fagan's history of a period of mildly cooler conditions shows how a little change can have immense impact on the human situation.  It takes little variation in &quot;temperature&quot;, he shows, to change patterns of rainfall, crop success or failure and resulting social disruption.  A phase of the Little Ice Age may not have brought the downfall of the French monarchy, he notes.  Crop failures compounded with a selfish aristocracy demonstrates capped a long period of discontent with decapitation.<br />Reading Fagan's account of the impact of climate over half a millennium can be a daunting task.  Although the focus on the period from 1300 to 1850 is largely European, that's merely due to the extensive written records kept there.  The variations in climate were global and Fagan rushes you from place to place to demonstrate the impact of trends and &quot;weather events&quot;.  Scampering about the planet in time and space can be disconcerting, but there's a reason for his peripatetic approach.  He wants you to avoid falling into the trap our ancestors did - thinking that a few freak storms or dry years will smooth out over time.  If these events impinge on a weak social framework, disaster can, as it has before, follow.  In modern times, with our huge global population, he reminds us, &quot;smoothing out&quot; is unlikely.  Without the means to counter the effects on society of global warming, the result will be far more serious than ridding the world of another monarch.<br />Fagan's challenge to the reader is far greater than tripping about the globe.  He wants you to understand the wide variety of subtle changes inherent in global weather patterns.  A small change here means the loss of a whole fishery industry.  Small drops in temperature there result in widespread drought, population dislocation or deprivation.  Governments, and their supporting societies, need to instill programmes that can adjust to these changes.  Social adjustments that modify lifestyle or inhibit vague promises of prosperity in order to provide survival mechanisms must be implemented.  Short-term benefit programmes must be viewed with suspicion, he reminds us.  Too many have already been proven illusory, and must not be repeated.  And wholly unanticipated events, such as volcanoes, must be factored into the planning.  The book's cap, &quot;The Year Without A Summer&quot;, has been shown to be a significant time in the history of North America.  When an eruption half-way around the world leads to crop failure in New England, the need for planning becomes starkly evident.  Today's global warming suggests many little volcanoes are compromising climate stability.  All those little volcanoes are called &quot;automobiles&quot;.<br />With a captivating theme and an expressive prose style, this book is an excellent read.  Fagan's use of graphics and maps enhances an already fine volume.  Although the title gives the impression that it's a work of history, Fagan demonstrates clearly that conditions long ago are exemplary for modern times.  We may have mechanised farming, for example, but the world exists on conditions no less marginal than they were in Medieval times.  The same triggers, volcanic eruptions and, most importantly, the North Atlantic Oscillation controlling Europe's rainfall, El Nino and other anomalies, are set to invoke unpredictable conditions.  He explains these forces with skill and clarity.  You will learn much more than some historical pedantry from this book.

The voices of those most directly affected by &quot;globalisation&quot; are fainter yet.  Michel Chossudovsky attempts to overcome the raucous proponents of &quot;international free trade&quot; with an examination of just what it does and how it impacts civil societies.  The picture he provides isn't pleasant.  However, turning away  will not cause it to fade from lack of our attention.  In fact, reading this book is an eye-opening, if not eyebrow raising experience.<br />Among the rare critics of globalization Chossudovsky has &quot;on-site&quot; credentials beyond his academic base.  He's been on the scene of several nations subjected to International Monetary Fund and World Bank policies.  He examines the results of these and other international financial agencies' policies.  From Chile through Rwanda to Somlia and Korea, he shows how a new form of warfare is under way.  Conquest no longer requires bullets to occupy a nation nor suppress a people.  Conquerers now wield position papers, American dollars or Euros and trade impositions.  Surrender agreements come in the form of &quot;conditions&quot; accompanying loans and investments.  These dicta result in the stripping away of social programmes, alienation of subsistence farm holdings and displacement of vast numbers.  These people, deprived of income, traditions and opportunity have become a new breed.  They are the  hopeless poor for which no amount of &quot;aid&quot; can provide succour.<br />As he demonstrates repeatedly, the mechanism is simple.  The formation of the IMF gave financiers, chiefly North American, a cudgel to change governments, force farmers and pastoralists to convert to cash crop economies, and reduce or eliminate government services.  The initial steps were instituted by the Bretton Woods conferences designed to restore nations devastated by World War II.  Private financial institutions imposed conditions on loans granted to recovering countries.  &quot;Recovering&quot; countries rapidly expanded into &quot;developing&quot; countries as these institutions recognised the value of cheap labour in them.  Accepting &quot;foreign investment&quot; led to indebtedness difficult to repay.  Defaulting was unacceptable to both borrower and lender, leading to new rounds of loans.  These, however, rarely reached the borrowing nation since the new funds were set against the older debt.  &quot;Servicing the debt&quot; meant imposition of stringent conditions, ranging from privatisation of services, amalgamation of small land holdings to produce crops to be purchased cheaply, but sold at inflated prices.  The consumers of these goods are you and your neighbours.<br />Each of the nations Chossudovsky examines suffers the same schedule of &quot;structural adjustment programmes&quot; imposed by the IMF.  These SAPs outline the changes a nation must endure to receive the &quot;benefits&quot; of globalization.  Restrictions on outside investment must be eliminated, with the concomitant privatisation of state-owned facilities and services.  Where workers aren't laid off, their wages are frozen or reduced.  Local currencies must be adjusted to American dollars, which has the impact of intense inflation spirals almost overnight.  The result is a populace under increasing pressure, marginal or famine-stricken and powerless.  Civil unrest isn't an option, since disruption brings reprisals - often, of course, the withdrawal of investment, failure to renew loan guarantees or simply real military action.<br />Although the repetitive nature of the manipulations of the financial institutions on national sovereignty leads Chossudovsky to some redundancy, the reader should understand we are dealing with a global crisis.  &quot;Bitter medicine&quot; and &quot;bitter irony&quot; recur, because the circumstances he describes are redundant.  An imposing and sometimes intimidating account, he is careful to shift the responsibility to institutions rather than consumers.  It is, however, the developed country consumer that provides motivation for many levels of the problem. Chossudovsky's analysis is thorough, well-founded and expressive.  He shows why social unrest in &quot;developing&quot; countries is the result of imposed conditions, not unstable populations and environments.  That he offers little in the way of solutions for the predicament the world now suffers is only testimony to the immensity of the task ahead.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada].

As it became clearer that life is a molecular phenomenon, researchers have delved deeper into chemical processes to work out life's start.  De Duve joins that quest with a detailed examination of these mechanisms and the environments in which they come about.  In his explanation of life's origins, it becomes clear that the mechanisms leading to life are common.  Earth, therefore, is not alone - &quot;the universe is awash with life&quot;.  If conditions are right, and many of the processes can't go forward unless the environment permits them to, life at some level is sure to begin.  &quot;Life is one&quot;, he stipulates, but likely in many places.<br />De Duve's narrative is highly detailed in the opening sections.  The conditions and operations he describes are fundamental to life's development.  How carbon-based molecules interact in ways that led to replication, then selection, are carefully explained.  While many of the early steps were random, perhaps even chaotic, &quot;superior&quot; [because they survived and replicated better] molecular structures became more common.  While he notes there are preferred environments for this process, they aren't tightly limited.  Change of environment formed selection pressures which even early life could respond to without difficulty.  While at first glance this description may appear an account of many chance events, De Duve points out that life started on a &quot;deterministic&quot; path almost from the beginning.  The rules of chemical reactions limit what chance can impose.  Yet, once the start has been made, similar rules force the process of life forward.<br />This book is a major statement and deserves serious consideration.  That this is a technically challenging read should not discourage you.  A thorough analysis of life's development, right up to that major achievement of evolution, the human mind, de Duve demonstrates how important knowledge of ourselves is to our survival.  He further postulates that values are an essential part human evolution, including wisdom, love, and responsibility for our place in nature.  True science, he argues, supports a sense of moral values, it doesn't abandon nor avoid them.  Learning about origins of life as a fact of chemistry doesn't reduce it to sterility nor meaninglessness.  These ideas aren't necessarily novel with de Duve, but he expresses them better than most.  He also provides a better foundation for believing in them than most.  A valuable book, it's one that should be considered vital for any student of nature or philosophy.

The reason for his hilarity is the theme of this book.  His mirth is infectious. You will smile, grin [even if wryly] and laugh outright at accounts of his experiences in romance.  There are a few tears here, as well, but he keeps the approach light and captivating.  He writes about feelings - and he does it with feeling.<br />Displaying a neatness rarely credited to men, Yanofsky organizes this essay collection into general topics.  \\"Guyhood\\" opens the set with views on some aspects of being male.  The next two groups cover \\"relationships\\" with all that term implies.  Some essays are serious, others hilariously satirical.  Yanofsky even offers a course: \\"Intimacy for Men 101\\".  The classroom scenario will be familiar to anyone who's attended a \\"self-awareness\\" group.  The myth of male indifference to a lost relationship is shattered in the \\"Dumped\\" essays.  What does it mean, truly, to be a bachelor [Yanofsky married after this book was published]?  He assures us that, if nothing else, bachelors as \\"party animals\\" is a false concept.<br />Men's views on the topic of romance are rarely taken seriously by today's women.  Perhaps because no one before Yanofsky was ever seriously asked their opinion.  When women such as Carol Shields can state \\"being a man is a personality disorder\\" offering male outlooks on romance seems a waste of breath.  Yanofsky demonstrates the narrowness of such a declaration.  He explains that men, although the term sounds alarums among some, have a role - and it's their own role.  To insist, as some women do, that males become \\"a New Man\\" is at best misguided, at worst hostile hypocrisy.  \\"Men\\" didn't conform to patterns in the past, what justifies their doing so now?  It erodes individuality.<br />The title, as you may guess, has multiple meaning.  It's not, however, thinly disguised smut.  Yanofsky seriously ponders our evolutionary roots in considering how men came to be as they are.  Did they, he suggests, descend from an arboreal life suddenly confronted by the knowledge things would never be the same?  It is, after all, the male's vulnerability that increased with the new lifestyle.  Such a step can impart a level of stress we have yet to shed.  He's bothered by stress - several forms of it, which keeps this book lively and readable.  He thinks men ought to be taken seriously.  Although the presentation may disguise that notion, it's vivid to him, imparted well us all, and justifies his contention that this book should be read by women.

By combining ingredients from history, stirring in good data, adding some spice of characterisation, a recipe of adventure and inquiry becomes a delicious result.  Dana Mackenzie has produced a confection suited to any reader's taste in this account of thinking about our neighbour in space.  Tracing the history of thought on our satellite, he travels down the centuries to reach an earth-shaking conclusion.<br />It's difficult today to view the Moon as the ancients did.  Once, it was considered a disc.  Even whether its light came from the sun or originated from the lunar surface was disputed.  The nature of the markings, Mackenzie explains, was equally contentious.  The dark areas were finally deemed \\"seas\\" and the Latin \\"maria\\" remains with us today.  After Galileo determined the moon was cratered, the origins of these enigmatic forms opened new discussion.  Volcanoes held sway as their origin, although no Earth vulcanism had produced caldera of such size.  Meteor impact was viewed with suspicion in an age when catastrophic events were looked on with cautious scorn.<br />The moon's effect on the oceans was realised in ancient times, brought strongly to further awareness as Europe sent ships to far shores.  Tidal predictability became a normal calculation, but much about tidal forces remained mysterious, Mackenzie reminds us.  Examining tidal action would help lay the foundation for the most likely mechanism of the Moon's formation.<br />Although Mackenzie introduces us to many thinkers on the lunar phenomenon, the key figure is Ralph Baldwin.  In the midst of growing debate about the lunar craters, Baldwin had the temerity to suggest that one impact had formed a significant part of the lunar surface.  The debate was resolved, of course, by the Apollo landings.  Among the rocky souvenirs brought back from those explorations were some green, glassy samples.  These objects can only be formed by high speed impact of solid bodies.  Deep in the past, The Moon had bombarded by meteors.  Some of the bolides had been large, and their origin remained in question.<br />One object had far greater impact than anything the lunar surface implies.  It was the body that had led to the formation of the Moon itself.  Mackenzie's \\"great splat\\" is the analysis of lunar material that revealed the Moon is made up of Earth-like surface material.  The Moon doesn't have the iron core typical of rocky planets.  The reason for this is that the Moon didn't co-form when the Earth did.  The Moon was the result of a Mars-size planetoid striking the Earth shortly after its formation.  The impact drove a mass of material into space which coalesced to form our satellite.<br />Mackenzie's lively account is an excellent read and highly informative.  He deals ably with some tough questions and cantankerous characters.  Scientific dispute is often entertaining, particularly when the reader has little stake in the outcome.  Yet, anything that advances research should be given attention and this book deserves yours.  In demonstrating that questions about the Moon are still with us, Mackenzie's final chapter examines the strange story of conspiracy theorists who contend none of the Apollo landings took place.  It's easy to dismiss this kind of thinking until you become aware of how many accept the notion.  He deals with it carefully, asking the questions and dismissing the idea with carefully developed answers.  This finale is almost worth the price of the book.

That's a good thing, since its effects have a long, and often disastrous reach.  It is not, he contends, the only issue to consider in climate impact.  It has been &quot;over-hyped&quot; by media.  The issues go beyond freak storms and harsh droughts.  Humans have confronted weather throughout their evolutionary history.  How society copes with global weather impact is Fagan's real concern.  He's collected a wealth of information in this well written account.  There is much to learn from this book, which includes some intriguing<br />surprises.<br />Comfortably divided into three major themes, Fagan opens with an explanation of El Nino's &quot;discovery&quot;.  What had seemed to be freak weather events proved to have an underlying pattern.  The El Nino Southern Oscillation [ENSO] is an eastward moving body of warm Pacific Ocean water.  The warmth blocks the flow of the Humboldt Current moving from Antarctica along the South American coast.  Fish die or depart, with birds duplicating the pattern.  Fagan stresses that the effect of that warm cell has global reach and has roots deep in time.  Pharonic Egypt felt its impact, perhaps contributing, if not causing, social upheaval and even a new philosophy of rule by those absolute rulers.<br />How society and its rulers deal with abrupt weather change is the focus of the second part.  As an anthropologist, Fagan is conversant with ancient societies.  He examines the Andean Moche people who engineered extensive irrigation systems to catch feeble rainfall.  With El Nino, rainfall changes from feeble to fabulous and the Moche watched their canals being flushed away.  The following famines broke the power of the Moche aristocracy and the culture collapsed.  A similar fate occurred to the Maya, whose rigid social pattern prevented them from coping with crop loss.  However, the Anasazi people of the American Southwest, long skilled in desert agriculture, had a different method for dealing with drought.  A loose, flexible society encouraged sharing of resources, then departure when the soil failed.  Fagan overturns the long-held view that the Anasazi &quot;mysteriously&quot; disappeared.  He contends they simply dispersed.<br />In the final section, Fagan relates some historical climate events such as The Little Ice Age and the Sahel drought.  He examines the short-sighted policies that have exacerbated the human impact of such events.  Over expansion in good years leaves no flexibility for addressing the needs of bad times.  Governments must avoid superficial solutions in the face of knowing climate will generate surprises.  Better planning scenarios are required for land occupation and use.  Although it's been said before, Fagan urges better understanding of what is sustainable.  That, of course, means more research and the application of political will derived from its results.  While that may curtail some short-term profit gains and force revision of some cultural noms, it's the survival of the species that's at stake.<br />Fagan's easy writing style mustn't undercut the value of this book.  Enhanced with good maps tied nicely to the text and an outstanding bibliography make this book required reading. Weather, after all, is part of the human condition everywhere.  We all need to understand better its impact, and cheap jokes about El Nino aren't part of that comprehension.

Perhaps so, but according to James Buchan it was the Scots who moved civilization forward to modern times.  Even at that, it was  Edinburgh that became the pivot of the Scottish Enlightenment.  With the expulsion of Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745, the \\"auld Reekie\\", stinky, backward, provincial Edinburgh, was transformed into an intellectual hotbed.  Philosophy, science, medicine and other fields found expression through this city to the world.  Pushing aside the clans, tartans and the remains of the Celtic traditions, a new outlook developed in Scotland's capital.  The speed of its rise was phenomenal.  Within twenty years a wave of philosophers, scientists and poets, accompanied by a revision in social standards swept the city.<br />Analysing the Scottish Enlightenment is a monumental task.  Controversies and inconsistencies abound.  This Calvinist society rose to support a Roman Catholic pretender to the British throne.  While condemning the Papacy as intruding on the lives of the faithful, the Scottish Kirk was thoroughly integrated into the education, politics and legal system of Edinburgh.  Buchan neatly ties all these conflicting forces into a readable, highly detailed package.  He is able to expose all these facets with minimal confusion as he introduces us to the major figures that would make the city a northern Athens.  His focus is on personalities, with leading figures ambling, cavorting or dashing across the pages according to their style.<br />His first noteworthy figure is, of course, David Hume.  Perhaps no individual set the tone for the Scottish Enlightenment as did Hume.  Controversial and inconsistent in his own way, he struggled to shed the impediments of traditional dogmas while avoiding accusations of rebellion or heresy.  He set the tone Edinburgh lights would follow - travelling the Continent, examining the human condition, and writing in \\"Southern English\\", as Buchan calls it.  The language of London was a key element in what was to follow.  English, instead of \\"Scottish English\\" would be the export licence conveying ideas up and down the British island, thence abroad.<br />Hume is followed by such notables as Adam Smith, John Home, the strange saga of James MacPherson's attempt to resurrect Scots' traditions by fabricating them, and the founder of geology, James Hutton.  Other, lesser known lights, but surely contributors to this Northern Renaissance are dramatist Alexander Wedderburn, publisher Robert Chambers and the more practical contributions of George Drummond.  There is more to Edinburgh's rise to prominence than the expressions of thoughtful men.  In this period, the city descended from an enclave surrounding its \\"castle in the air\\" to build up the surroundings with residences, schools and market centres.  The \\"salacious\\" hobbies of dance and the theatre intruded on the Kirk's disdain and overcame it.  Promenading, weather permitting, was no longer hazardous.  Although whisky replaced ale as the most consumed drink, imbibing moved from ale house to town house.  This practice helped enable the role women to improve and conversations expanded to include both sexes.<br />Buchan has granted us a vivid and readable account of Edinburgh's burst of intellectual and social hatching.  He does assume a certain level of knowledge on the reader's part - a level unlikely to be found on this side of the Atlantic.  He graces the narrative with some illustrative material, but no matter how much the publishers include, there couldn't be enough.  The maps of the city would be more useful if larger, but the tone the time is well conveyed.  Some of his conclusions might be arguable, but his making Charles the son, and not the grandson, of Erasmus Darwin must be noted.

Nearly three hours later, amidst a serious debate over what was on the end of the line, a concerned wife's inquiry forwarded by a policeman, and cheers from interested spectators, McPhee pulled from the river a 4 - 3/4 pound roe shad.  Clearly not a record-setter, nor an exotic species - the debate suggested bass, sturgeon and even tarpon.  What prompted McPhee to relate this event in opening a lengthy account of what, to some, remains a mediocre animal?  Surely, John McPhee, who has written of continental movement and extended vistas, must have a compelling reason to deal with such a mundane topic.<br />McPhee's reputation as a writer should need no introduction.  However, if you are unacquainted with his work, you can start here with confidence.  He deftly presents a melange of scientific information, &quot;folk wisdom&quot;, history and personal experience.  As with his work on geology, he entices researchers, fishermen, guides and legislators to provide him their views, which he relates with sympathy and clarity.  Throughout this narrative, his own experiences are told with wit and compassion.  Fishermen are great whingers, but McPhee brings a new level of sensitivity to his personal accounts.  He knows there's a god when a nearby fisherman nets six fish while his hook remains empty - only a god could permit such arbitrary antics in nature.<br />The research and folk tales centre on a particular form of fish.  Anadromous [&quot;running up&quot;] fish, among which salmon are the most famous, can move from an ocean environment up  fresh water streams to spawn.  This talent requires bizarre body chemistry, bearing immense costs.  Salmon die after spawning, partly because they don't feed on the upstream run.  Shad, too, remain hungry heading &quot;home&quot; to breed, but some shad return to the sea after mating.  In some regions they may make three or four trips in a lifetime.  McPhee, accompanied by fishermen and researchers, traces the history and physiology of the American shad.  Other piscine species are touched on, including, of all things, a hammerhead shark.  The shad, however, keeps centre stage.  Once scorned as &quot;just shad&quot;, chiefly due to its bony nature, many now acclaim its flavour when it reaches the table - hence the species name &quot;Alosa sapidissima&quot; - &quot;most savoury&quot;.<br />Books about sports are a major industry.  They suffer a common fault - they're universally inwardly focussed.  Baseball fans don't read about cross-country skiing.  Golfers don't read about ice hockey.  And fishing?  There's divided opinion about fishing among sportsmen.  Golfers, baseball fans, or hockey buffs often view fishermen with kindly disdain.  Up at ungodly hours, thrashing through damp woods to take up stations at a bug-infested stream or foggy lake.  Not something reasonable or civilised people should do.  McPhee's experiences, brought to light by his superb prose, bring fresh breadth of vision to the world of fishermen and fish.  Always an unmatchable read, this latest publication of McPhee must join his other works on your shelves.

He cautions that America must not let its strength in military power overshadow needs to be met through other means.  Military might, he argues, is not enough to keep his nation paramount.  Other forms of power are available to retain the US as a strong nation without the cost of alienating others.  Excessive unilateralism, he contends, only builds resentments.  While those resentments may be kept in check by military or even economic might, that kind of supremacy cannot be expected to continue.  New, powerful alliances can be<br />cemented by those with a common cause.  The \\"paradox\\", then, is that the US must maintain military strength while building up ways of avoiding the need to use it.  Otherwise, superiority will be simply self-eroding.<br />Nye terms other forms of meaningful strength, \\"soft\\" power.  Some of these are use of NGOs [non-governmental organisations], health care and education support, and information distribution.  He takes seriously the growth of the Internet as a major force in imparting and applying soft power ideas.  It's not a simplistic \\"pen mightier than the sword\\" proposal, but stops little short of that cliche.  In Nye's view, \\"soft power\\" is an attractor - it helps people feel comfortable and allows viewpoints to relax and reduces confrontation.  The best foreign policy is to encourage people to want to do what you want them to do.  Soft power can accomplish this end without alienating others nor eroding your own position, he explains.<br />Nye's thesis is well thought out and ably presented.  It's not a sermon about what is wrong with present or past US administrations.  In fact, it's a book that could be read profitably by any number and styles of government.  Every nation has some form of foreign policy, quite apart from whatever military or economic power it maintains.  Helping others to agree on what is mutually beneficial is the ultimate zero-sum game.  Getting the negotiators to achieve that end means applying the process Nye outlines here.  That his proposals have been ignored by the current US administration doesn't invalidate this book.  Indeed, it merely shows how more people should be reading this and urging their governments to give it heed.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]al is the ultimate zero-sum game.

His enthusiasm for the lands others call &quot;bleak&quot; invites imitation.  Whatever view we hold for deserts must be reconsidered and assessed for validity when we close the final page.  He shows us life where we perceive an empty terrain.  Brief appearances by birds, insects, coyotes, even water catch his eye and are imparted to us.  While the variety of life here is as vast as the landscape, one feature is brought into view repeatedly - the giant cactus saguro.  This bizarre plant becomes a lodestone for his travels because its condition signals so much about conditions.  &quot;Sonoran Desert Summer&quot; sounds intimidating, but Alcock shows how important this season is to life.<br />Reflecting the brief jaunts Alcock takes into the Sonoran, the book is a collection of essays.  The topics vary from feather structure for body temperature control through insect, bird and plant reproduction to government policies on coyotes.  The wealth of detail neither obscures nor is muted by the desert's vastness - an aspect of which we are reminded on nearly every page.  Mountains loom on the horizon and monsoon thunderheads build on their crests, but under this Hackberry bush a small butterfly is playing out a timeless strategy for finding a mate.  Alcock misses none of it, and you feel pangs of regret that he's there and you're not.  Still, he reminds us, human intrusion on desert solitudes are a destructive force.  The Hohokum peoples, who inhabited this area for a duration four times longer than Europeans have inhabited the Western Hemisphere, likely irrigated themselves out of existence.<br />Alcock, true to his role as a teacher, is full of questions.  How does the Digger Bee know where to excavate to obtain a mate?  Why do phainopeplas, a dark-plumaged, crested bird,  nest in solitude in Arizona but in groups in California?  Why do &quot;auxiliaries&quot; occur in some bird species?  Why does the zebra-tailed lizard wave its tail, an act likely to lure predators?  Alcock doesn't whip out the answers to these conundrums, but guides you through a process of examining evidence, talking about other researchers' efforts and provides you with the most likely evolutionary solution.  No aspect of a species lacks an evolutionary pathway, he reminds us.  We must work it out from our time and place as best we can.<br />What is the worth of these efforts?  Do they have meaning for those of us not granted the prize of desert residence?  Alcock's assessment of government policies of &quot;pest&quot; removal can be applied anywhere.  Coyotes, despised by ranchers as despoilers of herds and by suburbanites as raiders of garbage cans, find themselves targetted for eradication.  Alcock shows the short-sightedness of such policies and how to replace them with more realistic ones.  Heed his warning.  Humanity can't afford to lose desert life - &quot;writing its own epitaph in the sand&quot; along with his favoured saguro.

Few, if any, will meet the standard set by this excellent study of Canada's greatest writer.  A mainstream biography would likely fuss over whether the child Mordecai was disappointed in the gifts received on his fifth birthday.  Others, deeming themselves profound, would delve into hidden, likely unconscious and more likely apocryphal, layers of the person's subconscious. Yanofsky, emulating his subject's ambition to remain &quot;an honest witness&quot;, presents his own, lively and  valid account of Richler's life as a writer.  Given Richler's power of language this is no small enterprise.  Yanofsky is even plagued by dreams of his subject, waking his wife in the middle of the night to discuss them.  From the beginning, this is an engaging account, keeping the reader captive to the final page.<br />Yanofsky's subtitle says much about this book.  As a young man, Richler had strong ambitions to be a noted writer.  Yet what he wrote managed to offend nearly everybody.  They were his relatives and his neighbours after all.  In the post-Holocaust era, portraying Jews as anything less than heroic was viewed as hostile.  Richler didn't target his peers, he merely portrayed them.  He found stories in unlikely places and circumstances.  And there were different stories everywhere he looked - &quot;no two flats have the same history&quot; - expresses  how he saw St Urbain.  He respected individuals even as he depicted them realistically.  However, as he discovered, few enjoy being stripped naked in public.  Yanofsky admits that Richler himself &quot;would likely hate&quot; this book.  It isn't wholly adulatory, and treats Richler as he treated St Urbain's residents - clearly and factually.<br />The underlying theme is Richler's expression of his Jewish roots.  Writing in the years after the European Holocaust, he moved readily into the growing realm of North American &quot;Jewish writers&quot;.  If Yanofsky fails at all in this book, it is here.  Not just because Richler eschewed much of his Jewishness, but because he became the foremost voice in relating the life of his neighbourhood - &quot;this is what it's like, where I live&quot;.  Richler's aim was to explain to the world in a raw, intense, but non-accusatory way, the Jewish community's life.  That community, nearly as cohesive, could be found in many urban centres in North America.  Many, mostly young men, struggled to escape - Duddy Kravitz the archetypal example.  In another part of the city it might be a Dominic or Dimitrious.  Richler's focus on his community keeps Yanofsky rightly constrained.  Yet Richler's audience was far wider than merely his contemporaries - and remains so.  Regrettably, Yanofsky relates that &quot;Richler studies&quot; are fading.  If that's so, his book should do much to revive them. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]all in this book, it is here.

She runs the only Ladies-run detective agency in Botswana.  The business, however, struggles for survival as she's more helpful than profit-minded.  Her secretary, Mma Makutsi, proves unexpectedly astute in helping to solve the crisis.  She receives a promotion.  In fact, she garners two promotions as Mma Ramotswe's fiance, Mr. J.L.B. Matekone, develops mental problems.<br />Mma Makutsi achieves a greater level of exposure in this third volume of McCall Smith's series.  The attention seems well deserved.  She branches out in unexpected ways and proves both caring and efficient.  These aren't traits common in management - at least in this reviewer's experience.  But Botswana is a different place, as Mma Ramotswe continually reminds us.  Even &quot;knocking&quot; on the door of the house you're visiting is different from what we're used to.  Tradition is strong in Botswana, but the modern, Western world makes intrusions.  McCall Smith, through Mma Ramostswe and others, notes these clashes with style and wit.  His discussion of studies of the &quot;criminal type&quot; raises an old spectre - but is it a grim one?<br />Men in general come in for a thorough drubbing in this volume.  The young men are indolent and unreliable, spending too much thought on young women.  Older men are arrogant and unreliable, spending to much time taking up with young women.  Even Mr J.L.B. Matekone emerges with an unresolved shadow in his past.  A grudging respect is granted to, of all people, a man running beauty contests.  Women bear the burdens of responsibility and labour with little recognition of their worth.  It all reads a bit like Gloria Steinem in her more turbulent days.  One can only hope that this series will redress some of this condemnation in a later volume.<br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]	2004-02-24

In his innovative view of the course of human evolution, Stanley postulates that our species' ancestors essentially followed the course his mentor , Steve Gould proposed - a sudden appearance, followed by a long, stable period, then extinction. Using hominid fossils available at time of publication, he argues that \\"Lucy\\" - Australopithecus afarensis - represents a transition between tree-dwelling apes and ground-striding humans. He further contends she is a direct forebear of humans. What brought her and her kin to earth was the impact of global cooling instigated by the suture of North and South America through the Panamanian isthmus. This closure interrupted long-extant wind and ocean current patterns. A new, dry wind swept across Africa dehydrating the land and forests. With fewer trees, full-fledged ground dwelling offered a better option for survival.<br />Stanley accepts the recent revisionist view of Lucy - that her bipedalism was more opportunistic than her diet and lifestyle dictated. Her long arms suggest a heavy investment in the arboreal environment. Toes appear better suited to climbing than walking. He dismisses the Laetoli footprints as an aberration, unrepresentative of typical daily life. Stanley sees her commuting between scattered woodland and open grassland. The retreat of the forest presented an opportunity for a new species to emerge - Homo erectus. Erectus, of course, was the great wanderer who moved out of East Africa, beginning the great human migration to Asia. With erectus came the move to long-term child care, especially compared to other primates. Large brains meant difficult births. If a child was to survive, it required nurturing. The brain itself, Stanley further suggests, evolved by demanding greater resources.<br />Stanley's narrative is marred by incessant paeans to Stephen Gould's \\"evolution by jerks\\". Punctuated equilibrium has been essentially laid to rest as the fundamental mechanism of natural selection. It's not only disappointing to see Stanley flogging the concept with such ardour, but his reverse projection of the path of human evolution back through the history of life smacks of the worst kind of a priori reasoning. There simply isn't enough fossil evidence to warrant the direct link between Australopithecus and Homo sapiens. He spends an unreasonable amount of text arguing why bipedalism preceded large brains, with lengthy accounts of the physiology involved. This is old news, well covered in works by Johanson and others. Worse, it adds little to his thesis. While the basic theme is worth noting, Stanley could have covered the idea without wandering so far afield. A challenging but hardly definitive study.

In his case the field is the top of the Greenland Ice Cap.  The research is the study of ice patterns stretching back over 100 000 years.  What do these patterns tell us?  Need we care?  He explains detail with clarity and detail how the research is done, and describes what has been revealed by it.  What those finds tells us of the past, present and might mean in the future become the remainder of the book.  One thing stands out vividly - climate not only varies more than we believe, it changes far more rapidly than we expected.<br /><br />The Greenland Ice Cap bears an astonishingly detailed record of environmental events.  Far more than simply packed snow, this massive archive keeps information about distant volcanic events, how much salt is in the sea water and what kind of winds played over the Earth's surface.  Even conditions in distant Asia are recorded here in the dust layered within the ice.  There are records of long periods of cold and announcements about continental drifting.  Alley explains all the elements that must be examined in the layered ice, how they came about and why they occurred.  Earth's solar orbit, its tilting angle to the sun, and the slow precessional rotation of the poles.  All these motions are further complicated by oceanic currents, wind patterns and humidity levels.  Alley describes tracking some of the variations as \\"following a roller-coaster with a man bouncing on a bungee cord while spinning a yo-yo\\".  It's a dizzying picture and he's quick to point out that many points remain unexplained.<br /><br />Is this an issue that should concern us?  Human history from the onset of agriculture has been a period of unusual stability.  The future, Alley tells us, is highly uncertain.  The only certainty is that climate will change - it must.  Global warming is a fact, not a supposition, he asserts.  One result of it will be the addition of fresh water into the \\"conveyor belt\\" of oceanic water exchange.  The North Atlantic is the key site.  Interruption of that exchange by extra meltwater from North America will intrude - chilling northern Europe.  Human populations will be affected differently in various places.  There will be winners and losers in this situation, but the losers will certainly outnumber the winners.  How severe will the changes be?  \\"I don't know\\".  How fast will the changes come about?  \\"I don't know\\".  His lack of knowledge doesn't stem from lack of effort.  He reminds us that the information gleaned from Greenland is still new.  There's much to learn and do.  He calls to us: \\"Send us your brightest students to help, and cheer them on!\\".  A good piece of advice, but not one likely to be taken by a people choosing business instead of science.<br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]water into the \\"conveyor belt\\" of oceanic water exchange.

It's the chief rationale for controlling dissent.  Justice for minorities can be shelved.  The most blatant acts of government can be excused in the name of &quot;security&quot;.  This collection of essays by a wide spectrum of lawyers, writers, observers demonstrates how the Bush regime is using fear to consolidate power and undermine the democratic traditions of the United States.  It has happened in the past, several of the writers note - the Alien and Sedition Acts of John Adams' administration, the Palmer Raids of World War I and the Japanese herded into concentration camps under the Roosevelt administration.  While these events set a precedent, none reached the intensity nor had the far-reaching social impact the current regime has instituted since 2001-09-11.<br />The various authors examine the historical roots of stifling dissent in the USA.  They explain what prompted governmental repressive acts and how these were implemented.  Public reaction was usually swift and expressive, if not originally successful.  Ultimately, protest and legal action led to disavowal or rejection of the acts or policies.  With the Bush regime having declared the &quot;war on terror&quot; to be long-term, if not indefinite, note several authors, the new repression will endure and likely intensify.  This presents the public with a new challenge.  Even the normal, traditional  mechanisms of countering repression have been curtailed, almost without the public noticing.  This book, incorporating a variety of political orientations, points up the fact that democracy is more fundamental than party.  Rights, the authors stress, are an issue of law, not campaigns.  In particular, these essayists note, restricting freedoms to improve security is a false idea.<br />It is clear from this book that the barrage of unconstitutional declarations by the regime are not instrumental in defeating or preventing &quot;terrorist&quot; activities in North America.  These directives and policy statements are designed to impose a reactionary, even dictatorial, social and political structure in the United States.  The collection is a warning signal both to residents and citizens of that nation and elsewhere to scrunitise carefully any pronouncements deemed to &quot;increase security&quot;.  Reference to the &quot;porous Northern border&quot; of the United States in the Introduction is a clarion call to Canadians to read this book and follow events here and in the US closely.  With the Bush regime applying pressure on various countries to conform to its methods and accept his dictums, we must maintain a wary eye on our neighbour's intrusions.<br />While the attempt to gain the widest political and social spectrum of writers and commentators to expose the legal terrorism by Bush and Rumsfeld is laudable, the message  here is blurred by repetition.  We all agree the WTC attacks were &quot;horrific&quot; but the editors might have applied a thesaurus to reduce the number of times the word is used.  The incarcerated men and children at Camp X in Guantanamo have no civil rights, and their legal rights have been curtailed by illegal declarations by the Bush regime.  One solidly researched and well-written essay on that topic would have sufficed, even if multiple-authored.  The same standard might have been applied to some of the other topics.  While it's essential to the survival of democracy to be aware of how Bush, Rumsfeld and the rest are shredding the American Constitution, this collection stumbles slightly in the effort.

In this second volume of Botswana intrigue, he carries forward the characters established in &quot;No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency&quot;.  Mma Ramotswe maintains her role as &quot;traditional&quot; Botswana lady  in both girth and personality.  Her fiance, Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, however, gains in stature, revealed as  a man of small confusions and immense strengths.  A few worthy [and unworthy] supporters flesh out the cast.  Overall looms the figure of an American mother seeking Mma Ramotswe's aid in tracking down her lost son.  A decade of searching revealed nothing.  Can she actually succeed where so many others have failed?  And in so few pages?<br />With a marriage offer given and accepted, Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni enter a new level in their relationship.  Both have houses and businesses.  Will there be a clash over priorities?  Both have domestic and business staff.  How will those people be dealt with?  Finally, distant and faintly present, is the question marriage inevitably raises - what about a family?  McCall Smith deals with all these issues as he follows the interacting threads of the  lives of the lady detective and gentle-hearted mechanic.<br />Through it all radiates the presence of African traditions.  How to greet people.  How to offer and accept gifts.  How to present solutions to a client's problems when none of the options avoid hurting someone else?  When isn't it a sin to lie or even blackmail a person?  These aren't simple questions at the best of times and in the society of Botswana, they loom as an ever-present reality.  Clearly, McCall Smith is intimately familiar with these and other aspects of African life.  Yet, while his characters live in a different world, their problems and approach to life are hardly alien.  Still, there is a reason for a giraffe's tears - a reason we all need to learn.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]	2004-02-16

Alcock's relation demonstrates the wide variety and diversity of lifeforms found in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona.  Plants, insects, birds and other animal life abound if you take the trouble to find them.  The author is an expert at observing all this life.  Better, he's adept at showing you how to follow in his footsteps to see what he sees.<br />&quot;Footsteps&quot; is the significant term in this book.  Not ATVs, aircraft, nor other vehicular means, but walking quietly is the method to employ in behold ing the desert.  Alcock provides examples of his techniques in researching various aspects of life.  Surprising wasps in their rituals requires finesse and timing.  Seemingly, he moves directly from office to landscape - one of his marking tools being a bottle of Liquid Paper.  With this &quot;paint&quot; he can identify individual insects - male wasps and butterflies seeking mates.  This technique lapses with rattlesnakes and coyotes, however.<br />More easily identified subjects are the palo verde trees and giant saguaro cactuses.  His palo verde trees are numbered [in his memory], but the saguaros are often elusive.  Not because these ancient, giant cacti are mobile, but because his urban neighbours see fit to use them for target practice.  Many of his jaunts confront him with spent shells, pock-marked rocks and shattered giant cactus plants.  Desert soil pockets, often the home of slumbering spade-foot toads are riven with vehicle tracks.  Their passage disturbs the dormant toads who believe the noise presages water-delivering thunderstorms.  Awakening, they emerge in the belief the water is signalling the time for courtship and reproduction.  The disappointment is greater than simply mating deferred.  It may mean the toad has expended its resources.  It will dry out and expire.<br />In describing how the details of desert life is seen today, Alcock muses on the roots of life's processes.  Why do the Tarantula Wasp and the Great Purple Hairstreak butterfly [which displays nothing visible that's purple] evolve parallel mating rituals?  How can some species successfully deal with the spines of the cholla cactus when a human stuck with the spines must endure a full day's pain?  Why do some bees fly in solitude while others are flock in swarms?  Alcock examines these and similar questions with sound evolutionary logic.  He stresses that simple or apparent solutions often require re-examination.  Horned lizards only take a few ants from a nest entrance.  Are they &quot;prudent predators&quot; saving prey for later exploitation?  Alcock reflects on possibilities to arrive at a solution Darwin would have admired.  As do we.

This rapid enhancement has been attributed to many causes, new tool use Calvin, whose neuroscience qualifications are impeccable, offers a fresh view.  In so doing, he doesn't cease speculating on how we got to be how we are, but takes a further step in suggesting where we might be going.  And how to avoid getting there.  The human brain is neither an inevitable progression, nor a divine gift, he argues.  It's the result of raindrops ceasing to fall on our heads.  Climate, he argues, made us what we are.  Equally, it may undo us.<br />Calvin sets the scene at the time when climate changes forced the shrinking of the forest cover in East Africa.  Our barely upright ancestors, in coping with the changing environment, learned survival skills on the savannah, then spread out over the globe.  During our migrations, various new climatic conditions were being established .  The suture of Central America joining North and South America set new wind and current patterns around the globe.  The resulting North Atlantic Current [the Gulf Stream] and the temperature and salinity exchanges in that ocean have proven a major factor in climate.  Calvin examines what is known about these mechanisms and the impact of variations.  The most significant new knowledge refutes the established idea that climate changes gradually.  Sudden, wild &quot;flips&quot; of temperature, rainfall and snow cover are now seen as the norm, not as aberrations.  Change isn't on the order of centuries, but in years.<br />Calvin's technique of presenting his ideas is as novel as his thesis.  Each chapter is an &quot;electronic seminar&quot; with &quot;lectures&quot; and questions arriving for the reader's scrutiny from locations all over the globe.  Calvin thus presents himself as a field investigator, relating what on-site researchers are revealing.  And much, indeed, is being exposed for assessment.  Records from Greenland ice and other sources indicate &quot;chattering&quot; patterns of weather change.  These and other finds are related and discussed.  And presented for the reader to ponder.  If the text doesn't give you reason to pause and reflect, there are numerous striking photographs and diagrams to seize your attention.

A swift, panoramic view of life's history, it is well organised and presented.  Southwood examines some ideas concerned with life's beginnings, then moves along evolution's path.  He sets the environmental scenario, describing continent formation and movement.  He then describes how plant and animal life reacted to these changes.  There's a wealth of good detail, supplemented by fine illustrations tied directly to the text.<br />Among this book's attributes is the division of chapters by geologic ages.  Opening the  chapter with a world map of the period sets the environment.  He explains how the shifting land forms impacted weather through changes in reflected sunlight and modified oceanic currents.  With the environment fluctuating from warm and moist to cool, dry conditions, rainfall changed, forcing life to modify to survive.  Some changes were too abrupt to follow and large extinction events resulted.  Nowhere, from our viewpoint, were these changes more noteworthy than in human evolution.  His chapter on that most significant topic provides an excellent overview of what is known.  He provides a fine diagram of the various &quot;hominins&quot; but adroitly skirts the contentious issue of lineages.<br />With such a vast subject range and limited space, Southwood has achieved a minor triumph.  Research and assessment make earth sciences a dynamic discipline, with breakthroughs in the various subfields emerging more rapidly than ever before.  He presents the latest information available without disturbing the flow of narrative.  If this book has a shortcoming, it might be the &quot;Further Reading&quot; section which can only be described as sparse.  While such a list can never be complete, a dozen titles that should have found a place here come to mind.  That doesn't limit the value of this work, however, as the books cited are excellent resources for further reading.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]hen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]	2004-02-10

An inexplicable commonality is seen in agriculture emerging in distant places at nearly the same time.  Self-confessed - sorry, self-adulatory - Graham Hancock thinks there's an answer for that chronological similarity.  He contends agriculture, and civilization reach even further back in time than evidence found in places like Iran or Turkey suggests.  He thinks the legends and mythologies of India, Malta and South America point to a multitude of &quot;Atlantis-like&quot; urbanised cultures that have disappeared from view - under water.<br />&quot;Underworld&quot; is a collation of ancient legends, old maps, submerged evidence and innovative thinking that gives humanity much deeper roots than previously thought.  Hancock dives into the world's offshore depths, trolls through a wealth of mythologies, views unusual and unexplained artefacts and comes up with a challenge to consensus archaeology.  Was there a global sprinking of advanced civilizations at the end of the last Ice Age?  Did the melting ice caps drown more than the various land bridges that connected the British Isles with Europe, Sri Lanka with India and Alaska with Siberia?  If Hancock is correct, and he is not to be dismissed lightly, humanity achieved far greater social complexity during the glacial advances than just living in caves wrapped in bear skins.  What appears to be a near simultaneous emergence of agriculture, he argues, is in reality what we see left over from much older societies.<br />Hancock has made dives in many of the sites revealed by fishermen, archaeologists and others, recording finds on video and still camera and maps.  The images are impressive, as are the numbers of potential sites.  Utilising computer generated maps of the sea's rise after the Great Meltdown of the glaciers, he shows the logic of his thesis with compelling evidence.  He's careful to note where the data seems firm as well as lacking.  Where lacking, he urges more scientific attention to these places.<br />Although he justifiably spends most of the account on locations in India, where in some places the sea has invaded over 700 kilometres since the last Last Glacial Maximum, his relation of Japanese sites makes the most compelling reading.  There, some of the longest-lived legends indicate Japan's oldest settlers, the Jomon, preceded the West in the establishment of agriculture and settled communities.  Where scholars once held these people were &quot;simple hunter-gatherers&quot;, Hancock sees evidence of rice growing nearly twelve thousand years old.  Temple styles found today are duplicated in undersea sites, in some places nearby as if the sea simply pushed the people and their culture inland.  These people may have followed the &quot;Black Current&quot; across the Pacific to establish settlements along the western  coast of South America.<br />Hancock is careful to separate the known from the speculative, and not all of the speculations are his.  Scholars in the places he visits are contributers to this innovative idea.  So many sites and such commonality of legend add up to a highly plausible notion.  Regrettably, even while crediting these researchers with empirical methods, Hancock is a bit too full of himself.  Long passages of his problems, illness, fright from daring pilots cruising mountain passes permeate the book.  By restricting himself to the scholars, their evidence coupled with his own and other researchers' ideas, he could have made this account less tedious while recounting adventures and exploration.  Even the computer-generated maps are often repeated unnecessarily.  He raises serious questions which deserve serious study.  Hancock makes a compelling introduction, but we await a less self-indulgent approach.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]o note where the data seems firm as well as lacking.

Fry presents the thinkers and their ideas about this enigma with penetrating skill.  Her recapitulation of the philosophical questions set in their historical perspective demonstrates the persistence of many concepts regarding life's history.  \\"Spontaneous generation\\", now considered a quaint idea, dominated the view of theologians and natural scientists alike.  Even when empirical experiments demonstrated the falsity of the notion, versions of it remained, deflecting other proposals.<br />Fry shows how Darwin's idea of natural selection over vast periods of time allowed tracing a view of life back to simple, microscopic life forms.  Darwin's famous \\"warm little pond\\" may have been an incomplete picture, but it demonstrated a break with established notions.  Complex life evolved from simple life, not fully blown from a soiled shirt.  Only in the 20th Century did technology and the discovery of unanticipated life forms in extreme conditions allow a look at the chemical basis of life before complexity could emerge.<br />Fry carefully and skillfully examines all these steps, giving each thinker his due while placing him in  historical context.  There's more than one surprise here for those who don't know the lives of researchers such as Pasteur, Eigen or Oparin.  As she reveals the progress of thinking on the subject, Fry examines the roots of various proposals, their advances and their shortcomings.  Was life's beginning protein-based?  Are amino acids the foundation or the product of life?  Did RNA precede DNA or the reverse?  Science proceeds on a step-by-step basis and Fry describes that halting, but useful process far better than most.  While Fry's descriptive prose reflects a thesis style, the wealth of information here overrides that limited criticism.<br />Among the modern thinkers on life's origins, Fry provides the best summation available on the ideas of two men, Graham Cairns Smith and Gunther Wachtershauser.  Both men have offered theories of chemical beginnings of life, the one suggesting clay crystals as replication models, the other utilising the iron-sulfur energy capacity of pyrite.  These two concepts are united by Fry in light of the processes found associated with deep sea-floor vents.<br />Fry's conclusion deals with the likelihood of life on worlds other than Earth.  The dispute over whether the Antarctic Martian meteorite exhibits organic residues serves to show how limited current information actually is on pre-life chemistry.  More research, more examination and more questions need to be posed.  Fry's book provides a solid foundation for the next steps.

Which man should be awarded the title of &quot;Greatest Hater of America&quot;?  Bin Laden?  Khaddaffi?  Chirac?  Sorry, none of the above.  The man who hates Americans the most, and shows it in his actions, is the incumbent president, George W. Bush.  According to Ivins and Dubose, Bush has no equal in the damage he's done to education, the environment, food safety . . . the list seems endless.  The authors have produced a catalog of social and economic transgressions attributable to Bush and his cronies.  More than six thousand people, twice the toll of the WTC, die each year in workplace-related accidents.  These deaths were preventable, but allowed to happen through lack of inspectors, poor enforcement or emasculated legislation all the result of the Bush regime.<br />Ivins and Dubose catalog the transgressions against American society perpetrated by the Bush regime.  These authors aren't lofty ideologues, savaging the Republican minority president in favour of Democratic hopefuls.  Instead, their aim is the exposure of Bush policies on people we usually can't see.  Elderly residents of un- or poorly-heated apartments.  Working people led down a deceptive path toward unfulfilled retirement schemes.  Hungry children in American school lunchrooms being fed tainted turkey sandwiches.  The team took to America's streets, coffee shops and fast-food outlets.  What they found makes depressing reading.  They relate how fish-plant workers, driven by assembly-line processing speeds suffer permanent limb damage.  None of these people should be enduring these privations, as the authors make clear.  It is also clear that but one person can set those offensives right - you.<br />The ironies contained here surpass easy count or description.  One of the most glaring is the role of judges in interpreting the law and constitution.  For decades, American conservatives have railed against courts &quot;making law from the bench&quot;.  Under the Bush regime, it is just such &quot;justices&quot; that are being elevated to lifetime appointments in Appeals Courts, once established to ease the burden on the Supreme Court.  Even when the regime is finally toppled, those figures will continue affecting legislation for many years to come.  Their positions designed to circumvent political interference, they show the Bush legacy won't equal the &quot;thousand year Reich&quot;, but will extend far into your lifetime.<br />As you read this book, you begin to wonder if the authors hesitate to describe the regime's foreign policy.  As they express it, the complexities of the regime's foreign affairs elude simple narration.  Once holding the concept of &quot;nation building&quot; in contempt, Bush, leaning on &quot;the most radical and chilling foreign policy statement ever made&quot; is now embarked on a unilateral adventure in just that area.  In summary, they see Bush's dealings with other nations as moving from &quot;incoherent&quot; to &quot;silly&quot;.  The folly of a &quot;war on terrorism&quot; has been demonstrated by Bush dropping bin Laden from the most wanted to the most ignored.  Ivins and Dubose acknowledge America will be struck again, with no amount of bombast or rhetoric deflecting it.<br />Although the authors declare their distaste of overuse of the term &quot;fascist&quot;, they cannot avoid the obvious.  Bush's gratification of corporate greed and imposition of tax burden on those least able to bear it force the comparison.  Quoting Mussolini [sorry, kiddies, but we older folks know who that is] they remind us that this regime is &quot;the merger of state and corporate power&quot;.  If Americans can justify regime change in other countries, certainly there's no excuse for not exercising that action at home.  Indeed, that's the conclusion of this book - talk to one neighbour, one friend, one relative.  Show the need for change and have them pass the word.  It's possible.  More importantly, it's necessary.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]phen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]	2004-02-06

When that baggage is mental instead of physical, the jokes become sad irony.  This book took the writer to Australia's Outback to study Aborigine myths.  From the results he published, it would appear Gardener took in more than he brought out.  Although articulated well and graced by some intriguing graphics, this book is a wealth of outmoded and/or wrong-headed ideas.  It's debatable whether Aborigines reading this book would be doubled over in hilarity or twisted with rage.  On one thing they would all agree - the book misses the meaning of their mythology.  The reason for the mistake is Gardner's insistence on plugging European-based philosophy into the Aborigine milieu.<br />Gardner relates the myth of Wawilak Women, twins whose activities led to today's world by casting away an earlier earthly paradise.  Although this particular origins myth is restricted to a small corner of Australia's Arnhem Land, Gardner would have us accept it as a universal.  Even extending far beyond Australia.  In the story, the twins \\"polluted\\" a sacred spring inhabited by Yurrlungur, the \\"Big Father\\".  Yes, the relationship with the Judeo-Christian deity is explicit.  Christian allusions fill the remainder of the book as Gardener tries to relate Aborigines' mythology to modern ones through supporting the idea of extended consciousness across all humanity.  He argues that early Aborigine society was female-dominated until divine wrath elevated male domains and overcame the matriarchal hegemony.  This concept follows the neo-pagan and \\"wiccan\\" movements active today.  Regrettably, like the wiccans, Gardner is better at imaginative interpreting than he is at simply observing evidence.<br />Gardner's \\"excess baggage\\" is Carl Jung.  Jung's heavy-handed analyses of dreams is applied by Gardner as a tool to dissect an Aborigine myth.  Where better to use Jung than in  exploring the continent of the Dream-Time?  The Aborigines are bodily encapsulated in Jung's \\"universal consciousness\\" scheme where all minds are subtly and inextricably linked.  That Jung had little knowledge of evolution and certainly formulated his ideas long before the current wave of consciousness studies is not to fault his own efforts.  That Gardner should attempt to resurrect this notion in these times is little short of embarrassing for the reader.  Gardner's struggle to keep the notions of Jung in view is a valiant one, but credibility undercuts his efforts.  If anything, this book can best be considered only an historical curiosity.the Dream-Time?

Those disturbed by intemperate language or emotionally-charged critiques of the Bush regime would do well to consider this excellent essay collection.  Krugman's clear logic and firm analyses of economic, social and political policies are incisive and illuminating.  Bush's rise to power and actions since achieving the presidency are a \\"conservative revolution\\".  Krugman sees this regime as casting away long-held American ideals, fomenting class strife in a traditionally classless society and embarking on foreign policies disdainful of global reaction.  Bush clearly holds the mass of American society in comtempt, showing favouritism to a limited group of the powerful.  Using fear as a primary weapon, Bush's team has assaulted the financial structure, the environment and even American culture itself.<br />As an economic scholar, Krugman opens the series with essays on economic policies - banking, corporate greed and dollar politics.  He examines the Asian economic crisis of the late 1990s and draws vivid parallels with the path America is taking.  He sidesteps the \\"everything will be all right - just trust us\\" mode of economic thinking.  He probes into promises and the underlying realities with a surgeon's skill.  What he exposes is equally stomach-churning.  The American economy, notwithstanding the shrill declarations of the Bush administration, is teetering on the brink.  Krugman's descriptive exposure of Bush mathematics ranges from \\"fuzzy\\" to \\"false\\".  Not encouraging for the future.<br />The Bush fallacies, Krugman argues, lie on the backs and wallets of the American populace.  And these deceptions go beyond purely economic issues.  In the 1930s, another revolutionary's rise to power was greeted by many as a welcome relief from bombast.  \\"He will be forced to temper his earlier pronouncements\\".  Krugman shows how the Bush campaign and administration has foisted the same self-deception by the American public and media.  Abetted by the WTC attacks, Bush has wrapped himself in the flag, insulating his declarations from criticism or complaint.  The immense switch from a budget surplus to deficit was excused by the needs of the \\"war on terror\\".  Krugman deftly dissects that argument, displaying the fallacies of logic and fact the public is expected to swallow.  Rights are curtailed, monies diverted to special interests and presidential power is unconstitutionally enhanced.  It is, Krugman stresses, a time of a \\"conservative\\" [read \\"reactionary\\"] revolution  overthrowing long-standing American traditions.  \\"Yes, Virginia\\", he says, \\"there is a right-wing conspiracy\\".<br />The 1930s revolutionary made ever increasing demands.  \\"Compromise\\", was known even then as \\"appeasement\\".  Krugman shows appeasement is a dangerous a policy.  Failure to curtail unreasonable demands only leads to further demands.  The greedy revolutionary cannot be satiated.  In Hitler's day, the issue was \\"lebensraum\\" - the quest for more living space.  Today, the issue is domestic power over the population, permitting adventurism abroad.  Now it's not just \\"lebensraum\\" but \\"corporate lebensraum\\" - resources access and unlimited opportunity to exploit them with minimal return for the privilege.  Then, the appeasers were the politicians of Western Europe.  Today, to Krugman's dismay, it is America's media.  Informing the public was once the traditional role of the media.  Now it is the propaganda tool of corporations with control by only five corporations.  AOLTimeWarnerGeneralElectricDisneyWestinghouseNewsCorp as Krugman deems it.  This unity reflects the group's alliance as an administration voice.  Dissent, a long American tradition, is now curtailed at the source.  Bush's policies are excused, supported, even promulgated by a media sharing the exercise of power over the general population.<br />While it might seem an essay collection stretching back several years would strike a discordant chronological note, this is not the case here.  By assembling a string of columns, Krugman offers reminders of events that affect us now.  Topically arranged, this anthology provides continuity that might otherwise be lost unless you've taken the trouble to collect his work.  Krugman is a serious thinker and he's seriously concerned with issues that have meaning to us all.  As the world's most powerful nation, it is foolish to assume America's problems lie wholly within her borders.  American policies have a distant reach and have already been implemented with military might.  In line with any military environment, control of policies, resources and thought are part of the Bush agenda.  Bush wants the world to be \\"like America\\", but if that model stands on shaky ground, its not a pattern other societies want to follow.  Krugman has pointed out the problems, but declares that it's up to the American people to set things right themselves.  These are not problems that will be overcome by a new version of \\"Crusade in Europe\\".<br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]ring of columns, Krugman offers reminders of events that affect us now.

Cahill follows the taproot of Western Civilization from today through the Enlightenment to ancient Greece.  The tree is comprised  of branches on how to make war, what is valuable in literature, the arts, philosophy and religion.  It was the Greeks, through Enlightenment thinkers, who provided the seeds of American democratic ideals.  Cahill's irreverent prose, hopefully shocking to some, reads like a sophomoric rebellion against his Jesuit mentors.  Sex plays a major role in nearly every aspect of Greek society [and what's novel about that?] and Cahill delves into it with gusto.  Even here, the Greeks seem to have shown more restraint than Cahill.<br />Cahill is always a challenging and invigorating read.  He holds your attention through dazzling prose and iconoclastic concepts.  By dividing the book conceptually instead of simply chronologically, you are given time to pause and reflect on his ideas.  For a man relating history, Cahill projects unrelaistic modern values to ancient times.  He deems the Greeks \\"classicist, racist and sexist\\".  Yet these modern terms would puzzle any Greek of the period.  He extols their intellectual accomplishments without inquiring how the leisure time to pursue these hobbies was achieved.  Slavery was the labour-saving device of the day.  No-one then challenged its existence, why does Cahill do so now?  Slavery and division of resources bred a social hierarchy allowing the arts to flourish and democracy to evolve.  Only anarchy and pure communism can do otherwise - neither lead to arts or stable rule.  To call the Greeks \\"sexist\\" while admiring their presentation of the human form, whether male or female, seems a bit thin.  Given his presentation of goddesses, muses, and Sappho herself, his stance is almost false.<br />Cahill's title is interesting in view of how little attention he gives the Greek empire.  Their forays around the Mediterranean are but sketchily noted.  Greek settlement on Sicily is mentioned, but little else.  There is allusion of cultural imports from Egypt, but these might have been obtained from Egyptians or Levant peoples bringing them in as much as the Greeks seeking innovation from outside.  The focus here is Athens, almost to the point of exclusion of the remainder of Greece.  Sparta's militarism is touched on in contrast to the more democratic and urbane Athens.  'How Greek was Macedonia?', Cahill enquires, then dismisses the question.  Yet, it was Macedonia's Alexander, as Cahill himself notes, who  extended the \\"Greek Ideal\\" further afield than the Athenians could envision.<br />If the reader can recognise that this book can only represent a small step toward understanding ancient societies, particularly that of the Greeks, then this book may be considered a good start.  Although sprinkled with notes, coyly marked with Greek letters instead of numbers or asterisks, this is hardly a scholarly effort.  The use and definition of Greek words that migrated into other European languages is useful, but tedious to transcribe.  It's not clear why the Greek alphabet is included, but the Pronouncing Glossary is truly only a recapitulation of the \\"cast of characters\\" for which the Index could suffice.  The Notes and Sources are a good reading list, focussing on recent works where possible.  There is no discussion of contending ideas among scholars studying the period here or in the text.  A collection of photos enhances and expands on some of the text, and the one map is useful if you don't have an atlas.

Still, circumstances dictated [the film was waiting] and the deed was done.  Which merely led to a re-read.  This real-life story of three young girls escaping from the looming slavery of a Christian mission to return home is another entry on the balance sheet of imperialism.  With immense forces arrayed against them, the three evaded all pursuit, even expert Aborigine trackers, to cross half a continent to rejoin their families.  The distance covered was likely the longest walk in Australian history.<br />The roots of this story lie in the opening chapters which recount the actions of European visitors and settlers against the indigenous Australian population.  Women were raped, murdered or abandoned.  Men were killed, imprisoned, led into slavery as they watched their traditional lands overrun by cattle, sheep or grain.  The ease with which firearms overcame spears added to the European's attitude of \\"superiority\\".  By the time of Molly Craig's capture, killing had been mostly abandoned in favour of \\"assimilation\\" - a mild word for indentured servitude.  Molly, recognised the fallacy of being forced into an unwanted life.  She took steps to avoid this fate - many steps, as it turned out.  Enough to hide from pursuers, do some elusive backtracking and arrive at home.  At least 1800 km of mostly barefoot walking.<br />There were adventures enough along the way, and some ironies.  Although alerted to their escape, the wives of white selectors fed, clothed and sheltered them briefly.  Then dobbed them in to the police after the trio had again gone bush.  The girls lived on donated food, captured rabbits, birds' eggs or whatever else the bush provided.  Each contributed as best they could.  It was enough.  Seven weeks after their escape, two of the three were reunited with family.  Yet, nine years later, Molly Craig, this time carrying her infant daughter, had to repeat her incredible performance.<br /> To those complaining the book is too brief, one can only ask: \\"What would you add?\\".  This is an Aborigine tale told in an Aborigine manner.  It doesn't examine the lives and motivations of such people as A. O. Neville or Const. Rigg.  It doesn't delve into the psychological foundations of Molly or Gracie or even Mrs Flanagan.  The book presents the tale as it occurred without ostentation or enhancement.  There are numerous works on the conquest of Australia and its \\"White Only\\" policy and its implications.  This story, stark and simple, stands on its own merits.  Don't read it too quickly.

Humans and other animals have long contended for living space, but the North American experience is nearly unique.  Our dealings with wild life, plant and animal, have swung from nearly absolute exploitation and extinction to various versions of preserve and protect.  Both attitudes have been clouded by ignorance and misunderstanding.  David Baron vividly and expertly examines these views.  He explains how one community, Boulder, Colorado, has become a model for a new view of  coexistence with our fellow creatures.  It may have taken the inadvertant sacrifice of one young man to show how our relationship with wilderness must be reconsidered and recast.<br />Baron's science journalist's skills grant him the role of emissary, crisscrossing the border between the human and cougar communities.  He carefully observes the lifestyle of the New West inhabitant.  &quot;White, wealthy and progressive&quot; suburban Boulder came to typify a new term in biology - the &quot;ecotone&quot;.  Ecotones are the interface of humanity and wilderness.  Homes at town's edge, open lawns and gardens attracting deer, jogging paths over isolated ridges and remote canyons are a novel environment.<br /><br />Cougars, once fearful of men, and dogs, followed their usual prey of deer into this zone.  In doing so, they adapted to conditions readily.  Baron demonstrates the falsity of many myths surrounding the cougar.  They are highly adaptive creatures, even possessing a &quot;culture&quot; few humans recognise, let alone understand.  They feared the wolf packs encountered in the past, but quickly learned pet dogs are no threat.  And cougar mothers taught their cubs Fido could provide a meal.  Once thought to follow fixed movement patterns, cougars are now recognized as random patrollers of territory.  To humans, this unpredictability poses an unexpected threat.  It's led to attacks on people - in Boulder, it led to the death of an eighteen-year-old student.<br />This captivating account of how awareness of the ecotone emerged is flawless.  There are heroes, villians, people whose views are challenged and reactions to new provocations.  The hero of this story is not the slaughtered youth, Scott Lancaster, but Michael Sanders, wildlife &quot;manager&quot;.  Sanders, and colleague Jim Halfpenny, struggled to understand what was happening in the Boulder ecotone.  They recorded cougar sightings and activity, trying to formulate a picture of puma behaviour.  They anticipated potential threats while appealing to government agencies to assist them in their work - to no avail.  Local politics and attitudes intervened.  Even a direct attack on a woman failed to budge preconceptions.  The result was the sacrifice of a young man on the alter of ignorance and misunderstanding.  Baron urges that this sacrifice not be in vain.<br />His conclusion suggests the ecotone isn't limited to the Colorado mountains.  Wolves, racoons, coyotes and even geese are invading marginal habitats at the edge of human settlements.  A cougar was struck by a car in Kansas City.  Another surprised a strolling couple in Minneapolis.  A coyote strode onto a verandah near Boston.  Baron doesn't propose a return to bounty hunting.  He respects the needs of the rest of the animal kingdom, even predators.  What is needed, he urges, is an informed, pragmatic approach to wilderness preservation.  With the &quot;outbreak&quot; of humans intruding on much of the planet, new forms of wildlife management must be applied.  This will require resources [your tax dollars], study [more students taking up wildlife study] and political will [no simple answers].<br />Baron romanticises nothing in his narrative.  His realistic approach is almost unique in nature writing.  Certainly, his championing a new view of how we approach the rest of nature must be heeded.  He is clearly aware of the massive education process that must ensue to prevent more killings.  He stands almost in a &quot;no-man's land&quot; between those thinking &quot;nature&quot; must remain unblemished and those who urge further exploitation.  He takes what is perhaps the most unpopular stance in America today - arguing for further knowledge and understanding before decisions are taken.  In these times, one of those decisions is where to place the next new suburban house.  Perhaps yours.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]more killings.

John Alcock, after a strenuous journey from the moist, green, prolific environment of the Northwest, discovered the arid region of Arizona.  He fervently embraced the land many scorn as useless.  Now a desert dweller, he roams dry washes, climbs apparently sterile mountains and wanders in deserted Indian communities.  He has a lover's eye for detail - subtle changes become suddenly apparent.  When he shares his observations, as in this essay collection, you become one with his experiences.  His style is passionate enthusiasm - and it's infectious.  His descriptions of walks in the windy mountains bring chills.  A tumble on a hillside evokes the pain of cactus spines in your hand.  Outrage at the intrusion of humanity in this fragile region brings forth questions about your own values.<br />As a student of animal behaviour, Alcock's keen eye catches mating wasps, urbanised bird life and digging dung beetles.  But he's not limited to animal life alone as he counts the numbers of staggering saguaros, pondering the cause of demise of these giant cacti.  Each essay in this book is an intense expression of his fondness for the desert, its breadth, complexity and its surprises.  He understands that what appears bleak and changeless to us is, in truth, a dynamic and vibrant community.  The change, he insists, must be left to Nature's whims.  Human impact on this fragile world can be and has been, devastating.  Urban sprawl, water demands and highways have injured his beloved desert and Alcock resents the blemishes.  He's most outraged at the practices of running cattle on public lands and the policies that maintain that invasion.<br />There's much to be learned about &quot;seeing&quot;  from this book.  It's hard, however, not to feel it would be an intrusion on a lover's intimacies by joining him on his treks.  Better to let him go his own way and relate it to us through an amour's journal.  Each of us, however, should find our own patch to adore and assess the way Alcock does.  The more we know and share with each other the less likely we are to destroy it.  &quot;You always hurt the one you love&quot; in our case would mean the loss of our own habitat.

Almost a sequel to his previous &quot;Fishing With My Old Guy&quot;, this work is broader in scope and deeper in insight.  Quarrington isn't afraid to examine himself closely while travelling or fishing.  The result is a strongly personalised account of who he is and who he relates to in the sport.  An  avid fisherman, he makes clear that &quot;Catching&quot;, while desireable, is clearly secondary to &quot;fishing&quot; itself.  There's obviously far less stress involved in &quot;fishing&quot; than occur when landing a record size is the goal.  &quot;Fishing&quot; for itself offers a greater variety of experiences, which he recounts in his jocular style.<br />It's the variety that makes this &quot;Paul's Book of Fish&quot;.  Beginning with a quest for the majestic Steelhead on Vancouver Island, he crosses the Rockies to the Bow for Rainbow, and the Red River near Winnepeg for the monstrous Catfish found there.  An opportunity to examine wider vistas takes him to the Bahamas for the quirky Bonefish.  It's difficult to resolve which is more humorous, the antics of the Bonefish or those of the guides he encounters there.  As he relates, guides are a major element in fishing away from local waters.  Their status is always an issue.  When their self-image confronts that of the fisherman's, the clash can be explosive.<br />Fishing, to Quarrington, is not idle time.  It can be ideal time, but when introspection intrudes, the result can be serenity or distress.  Quarrington was surely almost unique in choosing fishing as a means of coping with the events of 11 September 2001.  He confesses it was his form of escape from the &quot;disaster of unexampled order&quot; that had occured that morning.  His personal disasters, a lost marriage and a lost father, further weighted his burdened mind.  In the Bow River, well within urban boundaries, he reminds us that Isaak Walton, dean of fishers, declared fishing a &quot;contemplative pursuit&quot;.  While thus employed Quarrington floats in thoughts &quot;like a shipwrecked man in a sea of debris and sharks&quot;.  He ponders, for example, what proportional disaster might befall the fish he seeks.  By the end of the evening, a small moment of good fortune helps redeem the day.<br />In the final essay, he returns to Vancouver Island.  Always a self-effacing man, the Tsunami Lodge, Canada's most up-market fishermen's haven, nearly overwhelms him.  He uses devious means to be sent there, knowing it's beyond his reach.  He's in constant fear of exposure, but wants to record the extravagance some fishermen will expend in their pursuit.  It's a compelling piece, especially given that the article &quot;never got written&quot;.  Until now.  This finale is Quarrington at his finest.  His evasive dealings with the lodge owner, his alcoholic ramblings with colleague Jake MacDonald, and, of course, time on the water all provide an image of a man for whom fishing is far more than idle sport.  The whole collection provides views of fishing no &quot;outdoors&quot; magazine can offer.

Where the image of empire was once faceless armies, religious zealots or expanding trade, modern conditions have changed this view.  Instead of governments launching empires, suit-clad businessmen now decide where the action lies.  Decisions to exploit resource areas are not made in ministry offices, but in corporate boardrooms.  Businessmen, &quot;and they are almost always men&quot;, choose locations, make investments, recruit workers and begin operations.  Until there is unrest.  Then they call in governments to support their enterprise.  If governments cannot or will not respond, the entrepreneur's answer is the &quot;private army&quot;.  Mercenary professional military men act as &quot;security&quot; teams, policemen or replacement armies.  And they are accountable to no-one but the firm that has hired them.<br />Drohan's account begins with the rule of Cecil Rhodes &quot;who stands head and shoulders above&quot; the ranks of those applying military solutions to &quot;corporate problems&quot;.  Rhodes built an immense resource empire in Southern Africa.  He also set the standard for controlling workers as firmly as he did markets.  By the expedient of raising a battalion of &quot;pioneers&quot; to deal with reluctant African peoples and recalcitrant workers, Rhodes expanded his holdings to an unprecedented degree.  Attributing his goals to the furtherance of the British Empire, he also ensured the continuation of profits to his own pocket.  Belgium's king Leopold followed Rhodes' example by keeping the Congo as a personal fief.  The Belgian government was simply shunted aside on imperial affairs for decades.  The rape of the Congo is a glaring example of imperialism run rampant, yet it set the stage for what followed.<br />Drohan's narrative is dominated by personalities.  Like a gaggle of rapacious ravens, men prominent in resource enterprise descended on Africa after Rhodes.  Some of these were British, some Canadian, but others arose from among Africa's own peoples.  These last were flexing political and economic muscle as former colonies became independent.  These new nations, with their artificial boundaries laid down irrespective of tribal or ethnic limits, became caught up in internal regional disputes.  Resource firms played off these rivalries to their advantage where possible.  If contests for power became too heated, the companies had the option to withdraw or find ways of protecting their investments.  Protection was provided by &quot;security forces&quot; available for hire.  Among the most notorious of these was the South African firm, Executive Outcomes.  Staffed by disaffected South African soldiers, it offered services directly or through hidden subsidiaries.  Executive Outcomes emerges frequently, if often vaguely, as Drohan valiantly tries to unravel the machinations the firm and its customers perpetrated as gold, diamonds and other resources were sought and exploited.  Legality is an elusive term in these activities.<br />These are not distant and unrelated events.  We tend to cling to the image of investment benefiting all - the theme of &quot;globalisation&quot;.  Drohan demonstrates how firms, pursuing resource wealth in Africa, have followed the Rhodes formula for success.  Whether hiring private armies or simply requesting local government forces to act in their interests, resource firms are steadfastly ignoring the impact on local people and their economy.  Of all Drohan's examples, the most glaring is the Talisman Energy story.  Her chapter on this operation is at once the worst and the best example in the book.  Talisman, a latecomer to Africa, seems to have learned nothing from previous resource history in the region.  As Drohan describes it, Jim Buckee, Talisman's head, followed a sinuous path trying to keep his firm active in the resource field.  With one eye open to profits and the other closed to government activities done in the name of &quot;security&quot; for his operations, Buckee brought his firm close to disaster.  On the other hand, the case demonstrated the power of the public in bringing such firms to judgment.  Various large stockholders, chastened at the thought of supporting a firm blind to the impact of its operations, withdrew investment.  It's a fine example of what individuals can achieve in acting collectively.<br />Drohan's book is a much needed exposure of business morals left unscrutinised.  In her final chapter, &quot;Perfectly Legal, Perfectly Immoral&quot;, she shows the path to justice for people under oppressive regimes shored up by rapacious businesses is long and difficult.  Yet, if readers pay attention, she shows how they can be effective in making change.  With a federal election looming, it would benefit electors to read this book and reflect on its message.

There's much to learn from this book.  Horgan's Grand Tour of scientists' homes, laboratories and their conferences, including  personal histories and researchers' theories is comprehensive.  You will learn ideas in physics, cosmology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology - in short, nearly every aspect of basic science comes under his scrutiny and assessment.  A wide-ranging book in time and topics, it is almost possible to read it selectively.  Major personalities in every field have their work, publications and personalities examined, revealed and commented on.  In short, Horgan takes an Olympian stance on nearly all science.<br />As much as he tries to teach us, you come away with only one conclusion.  John Horgan is the sole arbiter of the worth of science being undertaken today.  And science, as an enterprise, is through - in his eyes.  Horgan's theme is that empirical research has achieved its limits.  Particle physics is delving so deeply into the atom that evidence can no longer be discerned, only inferred.  Biology has no grand pronouncements pending about life.  Even cognitive science, perhaps one of the fastest growing areas of research, foresees no \\"breakthrough\\".  All future science, he contends, will be but picking out niggling details that reinforce the great conceptions of Copernicus, Darwin and Einstein.  Science, he argues, has gone from empirical to \\"ironic\\".  It is no longer grandiose, but petty and \\"not converging on the truth\\".<br />Horgan struggles to bring lofty scientific figures into your lounge room.  He visits Karl Popper, Richard Dawkins, Francis Crick and countless [but not nameless] others.  Dress and grooming are carefully scrutinised.  I lost track of the number of \\"khaki pants\\" his victims wore.  And make no mistake, Horgan's approach is firmly predatory.  Behaviour traits - chin rubbing, stair skipping, prolonged silences - are entertaining and sometimes informative.  But it's clear that Horgan relates them only in attempting to erode whatever status these figures have achieved.  His quest is simplistic and focussed - to each subject he posits The Question: \\"Do you have The Answer?\\".<br />\\"The Answer\\" is a \\"final theory\\".  The advances made by particle physics and cosmology during the last century suggested a unifying formula might tie the universe together.  Realisation of the concept has brought physicists deeper into the atom in search of evidence.  These depths have proven beyond our perception, says Horgan, and the cost of further penetration is too high for<br />the public to bear.  Besides, the quest may be futile.  There's no indication that a Final Theory would emerge from such probing, Horgan argues.<br />The Final Theory has implications in the other direction.  Can quantum physics explain the mechanisms of the mind?  Is the scope of human conception so great that it can someday interact with the mythical Creator?  Horgan challenges philosophers and neuroscientists to show their work is leading to new, more fundamental, understanding.  His approach is sly and disarming.  While he contends science is no long searching for the truth, he really means they're not divulging The Truth, an expression scorned by nearly all scientists.  The distinction is important, almost overwhelmingly so in this book.  Horgan, it turns out, isn't really interested in the status of science.  His real quest is for personal certainty.  It's a valid quest, but hardly worth the price of demolishing so many scholars.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]rode whatever status these figures have achieved.

At a time when current literature seems surfeited with either fantasy or self-indulgent whingers, it's a delight to encounter a good fictional account of historical figures.  Larson,  reaching deep into the past, retrieves the Norse hero, Erik the Red.  In school we learned of Erik's Atlantic journeys, but were quickly switched to Columbus as the conveyor of European culture to the Western Hemisphere.  When later evidence emerged of Norse settlements in Newfoundland, the old myths gained new status.  Now, Larson has brought these distant hints to full life with an engaging tale.  Fraught with plots, feuds, exiles and viking raids, this is a fine book to take up on long winter nights.<br />The story opens with Erik as a teen-ager in 10th Century Norway.  The Christians are making inroads on traditional faith.  The king, although a Christian scorning pagan beliefs and rituals, is constrained from forcing conversion.  Always threatened by Denmark's competitive forces, Hakon must lead his warriors in confronting invasion.  Thus, he keeps peace with his nobles, lest they rebel.  In the midst of these political and religious confusions, Erik's father, condemned for a killing, is exiled to Iceland, fairer than its name.  Maturing on the island, he becomes caught up in feuds typical of the era.  One of these conflicts, stretching back to Norway itself, brings Erik to Greenland to found the Norse colony there.  Greenland thus becomes the stepping stone for Norse landings in Newfoundland.<br />Larson panders to no \\"modernisation\\" demands in his stirring tale.  Viking raiders sought slaves, treasure and the power these brought on return home.  Christian monks were slain out of hand and coastal towns ravaged mercilessly.  He doesn't gloss over these incidents - they were the norm of the age.  Far more significant is Larson's depiction of Christian incursions against the ancestral faiths.  Most conversion was by fiat - convert an earl or a monarch and the population must follow.  The alternatives were death or exile.  Larson points up the tolerance of the \\"pagan\\" faith of Odin [or Wotan] in contrast to the absolutism of Christianity.  There is a subliminal call for liberality of views here.  The call should strike a chord with American readers whose forebears founded colonies to escape religious persecution.<br />Larson has obviously delved into the available material to underpin his narrative.  We are given details on shipbuilding, navigation, trade practices and making war.  He's careful not to let the information overwhelm the reader.  He provides enough information to set the environment, then smoothly continues the story.  And the theme is less the old image of the ruthless Vikings than it is the clash of faiths.  Odin speaks through the runes cast by the holy man Ragnar.  Ragnar, to his dismay, reads that Christianity will perservere in the Norse lands, leaving him helpless to prevent it.  Larson weaves this motif through the text lightly.  Neither Christian nor pagan are judged by this author, but only the characters themselves.<br />There's little to fault in this book.  Maps would have helped, but the atlas was at hand.  In an historical work these days, a reading list is an added bonus.  Even science fiction writers now point to additional information.  These are sins of omission, hardly glaring and not something detracting from a stirring tale, well thought out and thrillingly told. [stephen]The alternatives were death or exile.

He eloquently describes the rise of &quot;the new science&quot; in the face of traditional dogma.  It wasn't a straightforward confrontation, however.  Personalities and ideas alike clashed, sometimes savagely.  Cutler ably shows how science struggled to find its feet in this time, with Steno's career and heritage providing the exemplary model.<br />Nicholas Steno, born in Lutheran Denmark, led a peripatetic erratic life.  He was an anatomist, geologist, innovator and a proponent of empirical science.  In an age steeped in ancient philosophy, in which tradition substituted for measurement and experiment, Steno rejected what could not be observed or proven.  He mingled with Dutch merchants and the many religions existing in that Calvinist, yet commercial republic.  Later, in Florence, he noted the stability provided by the well-established Church.  In an age of inquiry, the Church tolerated the emerging science, so long as published works didn't directly challenge Scripture.  The Galileo episode, says Cutler, cast a long shadow, and the Vatican didn't want a reprise.  Steno not only evaded Church censorship, notes Cutler, he was encouraged to further his studies.  Thus, his later conversion to Roman Catholicism shocked many, not least because he abandoned his studies for an ascetic life and attempts to convert Protestants.<br />In Florence, Steno was championed by the ruling Medici family.  He took up the question of fossil seashells, a topic that had intrigued the Greek philosophers and Leonardo alike.  Were they &quot;spontaneously generated&quot; in the deep earth, remnants of ancient life, or evidence of Noah's cataclysmic Flood?  Steno's solution was not novel in itself.  His real contribution was his explanation of how these shells and &quot;tonguestones&quot; were found on high mountain locations.  Although published in a brief volume, his &quot;De solido&quot;, would ultimately become  the foundation stone of modern geology.  Indirectly, writes Cutler, Steno's ideas and meagre publications led to the greatest idea of all - Darwin's concept of evolution by natural selection.<br />Cutler has encompassed many and varying themes in this book.  It is one of the finest presentations of the issues addressed by the Englightenment in print.  The names of such notaries as Newton, Leibnitz, and Boyle flit through the narrative.  Even Thomas Jefferson makes an appearance - with lines that may surprise.  Just enough graphics are used to illuminate the characters or a point.  Highly recommended for many reasons, not least of which is the persistence of centuries-old dogmas in the face of the revelations of science.

Teaching science in public schools has changed from subdued academic studies to open battle.  The invaders are Christian &quot;creationists&quot; seeking the overthrow of one science - biology.  The defenders are teachers of biology.  This invaluable book provides a shield of nearly insurmountable strength for educators under siege.  The shield, however, isn't war-like propaganda.  It is a reasoned analysis of the problem teachers face and some advice on how to deal with it.  Of course, the information provided is applicable to a wider audience, even those crusading against evolution by natural selection and the memory of Charles Darwin can gain value from it.  The value of this book goes far beyond the classroom.  It leads to many issues every society must address and resolve - but with reason, evidence and explanation, not dogmas.<br />The authors present a straightforward, unemotional description of how Christian creationists think, argue and attack Darwin and evolution by natural selection.  They cover the many publications, speeches and other products of creationist sources such as the Institution for Creation Research.  The initial segments of the book are an attempt to educate the educators on what they might be confronted with in the classroom and auditorium.  They stress that the campaigns are many and varied in technique.  There is no single thrust of argument creationists present, because their own beliefs are inconsistent and often self-contradictory.  Teachers must be fully prepared to cope with this wide spectrum of opinion.  They further note that the teachers' position is made more difficult by the fact they are contending with dogma, not science, in a curriculum based on scientific evidence.  It is an arena of apples and oranges.<br />The most important aspect of this book is the emphasis placed on student attitudes.  By the time most students enter a biology class they may have suffered a lifetime of anti-Darwin or anti-evolution propaganda.  Teachers need to understand they are dealing with a well set mind-set.  Quick, easy answers or sending questioning students to sources they're unlikely to read isn't the best defensive weapon.  Teachers, argue the Alters, must go on the offensive, perhaps at the beginning of the school term.  They offer a full list of strategies, most of which are designed to provide strong student interaction and the confronting of prejudices with evidence.  Students, argue the Alters, are best convinced when they convince themselves.<br />How far this book will go in pushing back the thrust of ideology will remain an open question.  People who don't pick it up will learn nothing - they likely feel they already know all they need.  Those reading it with the aim of refuting it will not be seriously challenged with biological evidence for evolution by natural selection.  That information lies elsewhere and should best be given by the teachers who use this book.  Refuters, however, will have difficulty targeting the variety of topics Christian creationists address.  The teachers, for whom this book is intended, will learn much and probably be surprised at the enormity of their task.  The real market for this book, although only mildly addressed in the text, is PARENTS.  Parents who have been instilling ideology and dogma in their children should be the most numerous buyers of this book.  Parents who wish to counter the failure of teachers who are cowed by Christian creationist assaults into failing to discuss evolution in the classroom must buy this book and give their teachers full support.  They will gain many insights from this book and many strategies to apply in ensuring the quality of their children's education. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada.]n or anti-evolution propaganda.

Today's &quot;science writing&quot; covers a multitude of topics and a spectrum of writing styles.  This book provides a mixed bag of both, with some vivid winners and less captivating also-rans.  While that can only be expected in such a diverse collection, it would have been enlightening to know what was set aside in the selection process.<br />The twenty-five essays collected here cover most fields of science.  With Sacks' background, medicine is given slots, but the articles reflect more personal considerations than either research breakthroughs or even public health issues.  It's evident that doctors must train, but reading confessions of ineptness in the apprenticeship don't inspire confidence.  One essay, which must have caused an uproar when published, describes the life of two deaf women who decide to bear children - preferably deaf children. It's a vivid description of a sub-culture that must be recognised and understood.<br />Another essay about relationships centres on the prairie vole.  This intriguing little animal provides some interesting insights on the concept of &quot;love&quot;.  Voles select mates, build a nest and settle down.  The relationship, seemingly monogamous, may undergo some interesting twists under various conditions.  Those conditions produce severe chemical changes in the voles, changes driving unexpected behaviour.  Two chemicals, which are present and active in humans, drive voles to violent confrontation or endearing attraction.  While little furry creatures may seem to have little to do with human behaviour, further studies indicated just how similar human chemistry is with the rest of the animal kingdom.<br />On a more practical note, the ongoing disputes over the condition of American fisheries have brought together the fishers and the government rule-maker.  Lobsters, unlike cod and other foods harvested from the sea, appear to withstand the growing demand for their meat.  When administrators sought to control the take, lobstermen objected.  A new programme of lobster &quot;census-taking&quot; brought surprises.  Using the latest technology, researchers wandered the ocean bottom in submarines or remote probes to better understand the lobster life cycle.  Their studies may help save the fishery and perhaps point to new studies of other commercial fish resulting in fewer idle fishermen.<br />As a conclusion, a paean to the late paleontologist and science writer Stephen J. Gould is provided by his colleagues.  Whatever one may think of Gould's theories, he made an immense mark in educating the American public to science.  The heroes and pariahs alike of science came under his scrutiny and were illuminated by his prose.  It is a fitting end to this collection.

Like all older siblings, she feels displaced by the younger boy.  She feels resentment for his presence, his demands, his constantly runny nose.  She's already defended Wentworth against a mysterious attacker who rose from the local river to snatch him away.  Still, he mysteriously disappears and Tiffany sets off on a self-assigned quest to bring him home.  He is, for all his faults, hers.<br />A nine-year-old girl on a quest is vulnerable.  Tiffany, however, doesn't lack allies and support.  The first is inexplicable, the second is indefinable.  Her allies are a horde of small, blue-tattooed warriors - the Pictsies, the Nac Mac Feegle.  Their traditions run to brawling, sheep-stealing and taking a &quot;wee nip&quot; when opportunity presents itself.  They're expressive - in Pratchett's hands that means hilarious bits of dialogue, reasoning, philosophy and common sense.  Above all, is their insistence on freedom.  They've known a monarch, and they detest her.  They also fear the power of the written word and lawyers.  They're not alone in that.<br />Tiffany's support is in the memory of her gran.  Granny Aching lived alone on the Chalk.  She was quiet, but powerful.  As a shepherdess, she knew the ways of sheep and nature.  She could confront powerful people, achieving success with minimal effort.  No curse can match the potency of a quietly spoken expression: &quot;There'll be a reckoning&quot;.  Granny's at the edge of much of Tiffany's thinking.  She instills in Tiffany a sense of value: &quot;Speak out for those with no voice&quot;.  Is her memory enough to give Tiffany strength against the Pictsies' arch enemy, the &quot;Quin&quot;?<br />As usual, Pratchett delivers more than he promises.  This is sold as a &quot;children's book&quot;, but memories of The Who's great song will be running through adults' heads as they read the Nac Mac Feegle's fervent chant.  Like any Pratchett book, The Wee, Free Men contains many strata of ideas beckoning your further inquiry.  The first time you read this book, it will be for the adventure, the novelty and the fun.  The second time will be to delve more deeply into Pictsish.  See how deftly Pratchett confronts us with &quot;real world&quot; issues seeking resolution.  Pratchett is almost unique in his incorporating science in his stories, and is unmatched in this ability.  His depiction of the origins of chalk is a wondrous read.  Not  limited to physical science, he probes cogent human questions.  Buy this for your children, but when they've put it aside for the first time [and they will return to it later], steal away with it to a quiet corner.  You'll discover both a place to escape and a rigorous reality confronting you.

MR achieves a new degree of intensity in examining the human tendency for conflict.  The &quot;fantasy&quot; aspects of the Discworld are nearly abandoned in this story of war and soldier life.  To be sure, there's a vampire, a troll, and Angua the werewolf.  An Igor completes the team in a special, rather cutting, role.  None of these &quot;fantasy&quot; characters can avoid being dominated by their human aspects.  Pratchett enhances his ability to show us to ourselves.  While his humour carries us along in following the tale, the underlying theme remains clear.  War is a distinctly human enterprise.<br />Polly Perks seeks her missing brother in the middle of a conflict none can explain nor justify.  Hiding the fact that she's a girl, she slashes her golden curls, dons boys' clothes [including &quot;special purpose&quot; socks] and enlists to seek him out.  Her military career is fraught with risk, but not just from battle.  If she's exposed, the wrath of Nuggan, the local deity, will be boundless - dressing as a man is an Abomination.  As are cats, the colour blue, garlic and a host of social ills. These are lined out in the Appendix of a bible - with the Appendix larger than the main inspirational text.<br />In Sam Vimes' view, Polly has entered a life of crime, but not through her cross-dressing.  He thinks &quot;war is a crime - like murder&quot;.  Sam, Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, has been sent to make a peace.  When the stakes are as high as these - who rules the country -  the task becomes Herculean.  As with most wars, this one uses high moral purpose to camouflage baser selfish motives.  A prince seeks power.  Polly, along with her meagre &quot;regiment&quot; is caught up in the forces this war for rule has unleashed.  They are ill-equipped and untrained for their task.  Even so, Polly's first skirmish with the enemy has enduring results.<br />Pratchett, using Polly's voice, has produced his finest work.  He delves into military life, the vagaries of monarchy, and the shams of religion.  He exposes many nerves in this book, but with a gentle finesse.  He encourages the open mind while appealing to those who haven't taken the trouble to even ask questions.  Polly asks and confronts many of these queries.  She examines the answers in light of what is occurring around her.  She's sharp and alert.  She has to be, hiding her identity from friend and foe alike.  She learns to belch, pick her nose and walk swaying her shoulders instead of her hips.  Is this what's important?  Pratchett takes us to the abyss of gender politics, reveals its deceptive simplicity, and leads us away.  To confront a yet more fundamental horror.  He is adept at surprising the reader, accomplishing that again here with his usual aplomb.  Once again, he's &quot;mirrored&quot; our world.  Take a close look and see if you are imaged here.

What could be more remote from North American experience than the Great Sahara? Vast sweeps of sand, burning rock outcrops - there seem no breaks in the desolation. Legends abound of lost explorers, armies disappearing, cities lost without a trace. As the dunes form and shift under the persistent wind, the image of the desert as a dry sea is almost inevitable. As with any sea, there are islands - scattered, hidden and elusive. In the Sahara, an &quot;island&quot; is an enclave of trees, animals, birds, and what they all depend on most - water. One such &quot;island&quot; is located in Egypt's Western Desert. Known as Dakhleh, it has proven to be the longest inhabited community on the planet. The blessing is the continuing flow of water.<br />For nearly five hundred thousand years humanity has found refuge in this scattering of springs and wells that have come and gone with the changes in Earth's environment. A Canadian-led project is vividly chronicled by Maritime science journalist Harry Thurston in this oustanding book. Known as the Dakhleh Oasis Project, it has probed the desert for a generation. Thurston follows the multi-national, multi-discipline team of anthropologists, mineralogists, and archaeologists as they probe the sands for evidence. The results are building a chronicle of understanding of land use, environmental change and the ebb and flow of human society in the region. Dakhleh, once isolated from the Nile Valley, was ultimately governed by pharonic appointees. Conditions fluctuated along the great river system, but Dakhleh achieved a stability rarely enjoyed within an empire. Later, the Romans came, building roads and temples, scattering coins and leaving graves.<br />Thurston follows Royal Ontario Museum team leader Tony Mills, as he explains the discoveries the team has made over twenty-five years. The oldest finds, of course, are the flint tools used by the earliest human settlers. Later, communities formed, their construction testifying to environmental conditions - walls were carefully placed to resist the onslaught of desert winds. With a regular source of water, Dakhleh's farming practices diverged from that of the Nile Valley, producing exportable wines and olive oils, in addition to the grain crops. It was this economic stability that allowed Egyptian governors to achieve autonomous status within the Pharaoh's Empire. Dakhleh's isolation was sufficient to generate its own gods.<br />Mills' team members are gathered from around the globe - Australia, Canada, Poland are represented. These are dedicated workers, not least of which is Tatyana Smekalova who daily follows a clearly defined plot to record underground magnetic indicators by marching up and down with detecting device and a computer strapped to her back. Her records show where to dig and where to ignore. The swerving needle of her device has revealed buried communities and a major temple. More important, she finds pottery storage sites that provide clues about how people lived. Pottery may contain anything from grains to coins.<br />Thurston depicts the findings of immense importance. Mummies, hidden from grave robbers emerge with golden faces. The dry air preserves even straw sandals, revealed after centuries of abandonment. Reams of papyrus rolls came to light, but in Thurston's account, the greatest discovery was a stack of wooden platters, once tied together with string. As the sand was brushed away, writing appeared on the pieces of wood. The package proved to be the world's oldest book!<br />On a flight to the camp, Thurston encountered a courteous young Egyptian, who offered him a window seat, saying &quot;It's only desert&quot;. Sorrowing at the light dismissal, Thurston reflects on the many treasures unearthed from the young man's &quot;Only desert&quot;. In relating the journey through immense time in his account of the project he's nearly become part of it. Under his deft touch, Island of the Blessed reads more like an adventure yarnthan history or science. Yet the science is solid and the history valid, related with a captivating style. The story isn't merely ancient societies and artefacts. A major element in the researchers' work is tracking how the fluctuating environment affected human life. So long as the water continued to flow, the communities survived. Changes in weather cycles and excessive demands are draining the water below our reach. It's becoming an all too-familiar tale. The great underlying water table is disappearing, a fact being repeated in many places. North America is not exempt. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa]than history or science.

His florid style and incisive wit keeps you spellbound.  Underlying the vituperation, however, is some solid research.  More importantly, the foundation of his exhortation is a desire to restore America to its democratic roots.  Whether you agree with his method, the message contained here must be read and understood.  The message has implications reaching far beyond the borders of the United States.<br />The World Trade Centre attacks killed far fewer Americans than die every year on the highways, by murders or even by polluted air.  Moore argues that George W. Bush has used the attack to build an environment of fear in America.  That miasma has allowed nearly any policy the adminstration desires, whether selective tax reductions, support for oppressive regimes other than Iraq or runaway corporate greed, to be incorporated.  In the process, normal rights have been eroded or elminated, long-standing allies have been alienated and war has become a national policy.  And protracted war is an instrument leading to absolutism.<br />It's easy to rampage against power.  George W. Bush may have stolen the 2000 election, but he is the incumbent, and incumbents always have an edge.  Moore has no illusions about the task he's set himself and his fellow countrymen.  After asserting what must be the most astonishing statement in the book - &quot;Most Americans are liberals&quot; - he documents the claim and goes on to list how to restore that truth.  In a contrived discussion with a &quot;conservative brother-in-law&quot;, he demonstrates how RINOs [&quot;Republicans In Name Only] can be educated about the real costs of Bush policies.  Once that practice session of dialogue is completed, the reader is exhorted to &quot;go thou and do likewise&quot; with friends and neighbours.  He offers suggestions for the minimal activism needed to oust this revolutionary incumbancy.  You will be astonished at the minimal costs in time, energy and money required to restore American to a democratic nation.<br />Please read and follow his advice.  As your nearest neighbour, we in Canada have little desire to be drawn into the social, political and moral swamp Bush has instituted.  In today's &quot;globalised&quot; world, it will be impossible to extricate ourselves from a furthering of America's decline.  You are our best allies, but following the path Moore documents will only bring disaster to all of North America.

Bringing together such fields as geology, biochemistry, genetics and, of course, his own science of paleontology, he presents a vivid image of how life formed long ago.  The subtitle is deceptively simple.  &quot;First three billion years&quot; rolls off the tongue easily.  Knoll demonstrates the quest to understand how life originated has been elusive and arduous.  The search, he reminds us constantly, is far from over.  We may not even gain meaningful grasp of the subject if we restrict the inquiry to this planet.<br />Knoll asserts the benchmark for comprehending how life may have started was the Urey-Miller experiments of the 1950s.  By assuming a particular composition of Earth's early atmosphere and bombarding that recipe with electricity to duplicate lightning, Urey and Miller produced amino acids.  Knoll credits these experiments not with showing how life began, but by their stimulation of much further research.  Since then, geologists have revealed increasingly older rocks.  Instead of buried deep beneath the surface as might be expected, they are often found well exposed.  Knoll's expeditions to chilly Siberian sites are offset by the roaring desert of outback Australia.  Both locations have provided researchers with new information on composition, chemical and environmental processes, and, most significantly, Precambrian fossils.<br />The many research fields now involved in developing a picture of life's beginnings indicate how complex a task unveiling &quot;simple&quot; can be.  Early life, of course, was microscopic.  Sometimes it isn't fossils that are found, but spoor remains - tracks once left in mud, images of forms, and, most intriguing for many, chemical signatures.  The chemical, is usually carbon, that fundamental element of life.  But other elements, iron, sulfur and oxygen also carry messages about living processes.<br />Knoll manages a delicate arabesque as he presents us with the evidence obtained and the interpretations derived from it.  He carefully delineates the fossil information given by the rocks, mixing it with geological and geochemical processes.  Various researchers are given voice through his narrative.  Where issues are contentious, and most ideas of early life fit that description, he explains the reasons behind the stance, then offers his own choice.  While the conflict is rarely solved, none of his solutions are arbitrary or based on personality.  You are still left to satisfy your own mind through his references.  Knoll's prose presents this information and discussion with clarity and balance.  At the end, with these lucid explanations as background, he considers that answers to many of our questions may be found on our nearest planetary neighbour - Mars.<br />Beyond the informative text provided, Knoll enhances the book with site photographs to convey the scale of the locations excavated.  Ancient landscapes are today stark, and the photos do little to convey the nippy Kotuikan cliffs or the roasting Precambrian site of North Pole, Western Australia.  A collection of plates offers stunning colour images of ancient fossils and some modern equivalents.  He further diagrams phylogenetic trees showing the relationship of organisms and why they are considered related.  Not all life, he reminds us, has followed the path to complexity.  With a good, but not exhaustive, reading list to examine, the reader may continue the pursuit.  The younger reader may even wish to further the knowledge we have.  Knoll exhorts the next generation of early life researchers to examine the questions and go afield to provide more answers.  There are few worthier causes.

Knoll's prose presents this information and discussion with clarity and balance.  At the end, with these lucid explanations as background, he considers that answers to many of our questions may be found on our nearest planetary neighbour - Mars.<br />Beyond the informative text provided, Knoll enhances the book with site photographs to convey the scale of the locations excavated.  Ancient landscapes are today stark, and the photos do little to convey the nippy Kotuikan cliffs or the roasting Precambrian site of North Pole, Western Australia.  A collection of plates offers stunning colour images of ancient fossils and some modern equivalents.  He further diagrams phylogenetic trees showing the relationship of organisms and why they are considered related.  Not all life, he reminds us, has followed the path to complexity.  With a good, but not exhaustive, reading list to examine, the reader may continue the pursuit.  The younger reader may even wish to further the knowledge we have.  Knoll exhorts the next generation of early life researchers to examine the questions and go afield to provide more answers.  There are few worthier causes.

An intense, powerfully written, story of the people who labour to support our sweet tooth.  Cambeira forcefully confronts us with a stratified society, racially based, in which the individual fits into an assigned space with little chance of escape.  Skin colour determines who you are and where you belong in society.  Here, in 20th Century Caribbean society, he portrays  a civil structure reflecting a condition left behind with the Middle Ages.  It isn't the church holding the population in thrall as it was then, however.  Today, it's the transnational corporation reaching across great distances that determines what kinds of lives working people follow.  The picture of oppression is typified by a young girl, Azucar, who is raped in the opening scene.<br />Azucar's life in the sugar plantation envelopes her with ancient traditions challenging the impact of modern economics.  Living with her grandmother, Dona Fela, she is brought into the cane fields at an early age.  She attempts to match the labours of the men and women of the &quot;batey&quot; community as they struggle to meet the imposed production quotas.  The middle level of the sugar-based society are the &quot;capataz&quot;, resident overseers of the plantations.  With quotas and profits the compelling drive, a capataz has little interest in the well-being of the workers.  After all, if the labourers fall ill, die or desert, there are many replacements that can be brought in from other Caribbean locations.  Capataz indifference subjects the workers to ongoing debasement.  Rebellion in some form is the sole option they have.<br />Dona Fela, her wrath aroused by Azucar's rape, becomes the focus of reaction to the oppressive life.  Her only meaningful ally is Don Anselmo, an old man among the workers, but a constant voice of revolt.  Dona Fela's other allies are more ephemeral - the loas, spiritual guardians of ancient tradition.  She calls on them, but as with any prayer, you are left to wonder what she actually experiences and what she does on her own.  Even as she acts, it is the loas that are credited for events.  Their hold over her actions is manifested in a horrible sacrifice she makes on Azucar's behalf.  That Azucar achieves an escape may be attributed to the loas, or to Dona Fela.<br />The conclusion to this book stands as a monument to irony.  Cambeira exposes many previously unregarded issues in this book.  Do we ever think of the source of many of our goods - in this case, sugar?  Do we know what conditions workers exist in as &quot;globalisation&quot; proceeds?  What happens when an established economic structure is suddenly demolished?  Reform and revolution may be the only cure for oppressive conditions, but what replaces that environment?  As Cambeira cautions, the overthrow of an oppressive regime doesn't allow us to turn away from it with a sense of satisfaction.<br />This book, compelling as it reads, is in need of an editor.  While the rhetoric of revolution decrees repetition, Cambeira's propoganda message might have encompassed a wider scenario.  Is there a role, good or bad, for the Church in this world of Afro-Spanish descent?  The editor might have advised Cambeira that &quot;conscious&quot; doesn't plague an individual the way a &quot;conscience&quot; does.

He can apply his strong powers of logic to solving them.  Knowing all the prime numbers up to 7057 [at 15!] suggests his math and logic skills.  When he discovers a neighbour's murdered poodle, he embraces the challenge.  Become a detective!  Find the murderer!  So Christopher, who cannot lie, can't abide strangers, forecasts his days by colour signals, begins his career as an investigator.  He records his progress in a journal, which becomes this book.  Once started, like Christopher's quest, this book rejects distraction.  Every page is a delight - informative, poignant, challenging in multiple ways.<br />His \\"detecting\\" confronts Christopher with many problems, not least of which is rapping a copper on the hooter.  Receiving a \\"caution\\" from the Swinton police and a stern censure from his father, he's enjoined to \\"keep your nose out of other people's business\\".  The dictum only leads him to apply precise logic when encountering others.  A fan of Sherlock Holmes, he admires the analytical processes of detctive work.  If he doesn't ask questions, he's not \\"investigating\\".  If others ask him questions, he brings strict logic to bear on his response.  He fathoms the \\"white lie\\".  He knows how metaphor and simile differ.  He also understands, and beautifully explains, consciousness, different forms of memory, cosmology, and evolution.  And theology - he knows there is no heaven for the dead.<br />The security of that knowledge enabled him to accept his mother's death with equanimity.  But when his investigation confronts him with a new mystery - one which involves his mother, his aplomb shatters.  Things thought stable no longer support his view of the world.  He must now confront challenges he previously held at bay.  From being a \\"mystery\\", Haddon's tale becomes an adventure.  No astronaut nor jungle explorer faced such enigmas as Christopher must now confront.  Nor with such impediments.<br />Christopher is autistic, a condition with no clear definition, treatment or root cause.  He suffers Behavioral Problems, carefully listing eighteen of them.  He understands that he doesn't understand other people.  And sees no reason to try to learn how.  They don't seem to want to understand him.  He's in a school for children who have Learning Difficulties, but people who \\"have difficulty learning French\\" or \\"who don't understand relativity\\" aren't in there with him.  Some children have Special Needs, but people who use saccharine instead of sugar and who have hearing aids, aren't in the school.  \\"None of these people are Special Needs, even if they have special needs\\" he says.<br />Haddon provides a revelation into autistic minds no clinical study can match.  Yet this exposure is done with such charm and grace, the reader can only be captivated by the narrative.  A book that can be read on many levels, none complete nor wholly correct, it will long stand as a model.  It might even help us cast aside some of our prejudices about distinctions between \\"normal\\" and \\"peculiar\\" behaviour.  Shed your preconceived notions as you open the book.

The options are limited for a woman in Botswana.  She sets out on an uncharted course, opening the first private detective agency run by a woman.  At least in Botswana.  Mma Ramotswe is  a commanding figure.  She's stout, observant and reasons with precise logic.  She would have made a great politician.  Instead, she buys a house, an office, hires a secretary, installs a telephone - and sits down to wait for clients.  It seems she's likely to shut it all down within a week.<br />Instead, clients come calling.  The result is a series of vignettes of her clients' problems and their resolutions.  There are wandering husbands, rebellious teen-age children [are there any other kind?] and a missing, probably murdered child.  Justice, although never mentioned by either McCall Smith or Mma Ramotswe, is an important element throughout these episodes.  Justice and the value of being an African.  McCall is knowledgeable about Southern Africa and its people.  He imparts that understanding with marvelous skill.  His Scottish background never intrudes or distracts.  Except perhaps in one of Mma's more bizarre cases.  The Scots treasure their reputation for producing fine doctors.  One of Mma Ramotswe's mysteries is the occasionally inept doctor.  It is clearly the highlight of this superb book.<br />Mma Ramotswe, in establishing her unique agency, might be thought to have shed her personal life.  After all, she had a brief, unhappy marriage.  Men are to be watched, controlled, and manipulated in ways to prevent their wandering.  Yet, as might be expected, there is a man in her town whose value transcends the image dominated by wandering husbands or lovers.  He knows her worth and she his, but his stumbling proposal is rebuffed.  There's no strain on the friendship, however, and it becomes clear the two will be useful to each other in the future.<br />McCall Smith has accomplished something very special with this book.  It cries out for a sequel [of which there are now four] for many reasons.  It certainly shatters the long-standing image of the &quot;detective&quot; novel with its stacks of corpses, inept policemen and implausible characters.  Mma Ramotswe is simply a capable woman without special powers.  She focusses on the problem at hand, keeps distractions at bay and refuses to deal in absolutes.  McCall Smith's powers of characterisation, locale and story place him far above the traditional examples of the &quot;mystery&quot; genre.  He is compelling reading for anyone.

850499:US	50941451	RRH5RA50VRJUL	0895262002	107650463	Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth? Why Much of What We Teach About Evolution Is Wrong	Books	1	87	152	N	N	Misleading, misdirected and mostly mistaken	Wells joins the ranks of writers seeking any exploitable niche in evolutionary studies.  The purpose of these works is to insert a Christian creationist wedge into the gaps remaining to be filled by serious science.  The gaps thus allow &quot;alternative&quot; theories to explain areas not yet investigated, fully explained or not enjoying a consensus among scientists.  The alternative, of course, is some form of divine intervention in evolution.  Since Biblical sources have been invalidated by constitutional or court fiat, the Christian creationists now employ degreed writers sympathetic to their plan.  The campaign aims to force &quot;equal time&quot; in public  education for their assertions.  Wells provides a weapon in the crusade with this book.  Like others of his bent, he dons a cloak of &quot;scientific authority&quot; by supposedly demonstrating that the way evolution is understood today is false.  He offers little that is new, nothing that refutes evolution by natural selection and keeps his true motives hidden until the conclusion.<br />The creationist assault on science tackles many topics, but the ultimate target remains Darwin's evolution by natural selection.  Cosmology, physics, chemistry and other disciplines which are an offshoot of centuries of study are conveniently overlooked.  The primary issue remains life, its origins and processes.  Wells selects ten topics to examine and critique, from the Urey-Miller experiment resulting in laboratory-generated amino acids to human evolution.  His approach is to review some of the issues raised over many years of research, then attempt to refute them with oblique reasoning.  By this tight approach, using misleading statements, omitting clarifying studies and avoiding [or not understanding] evolutionary processes.<br />His first target is easy - how did life begin?  The origins of biochemical processes will remain hidden by the stretch of time.  He rails against the accolades given the Urey-Miller experiments of fifty years ago, studiously ignoring the refinements that have been applied to their experiments by two generations of study.  Attempting to refute the sources of atmospheric gases, he wholly ignores the research in deep-ocean vents shown to produce the kinds of gases Urey and Miller proposed in their experiments.  Wells claims a &quot;near-consensus  of geochemists&quot; support his conclusion, a statement clearly false, as anyone even skimming the literature would discover.<br />He later tries to discredit Darwin's portrayal of evolution as a &quot;tree of life&quot; producing ever-changing organisms from an ancient single beginning to today's highly diverse forms.  This assertion is so time-worn as to be nearly ludicrous.  Darwin's diagram was his way of simplifying the evolutionary process and was never intended to be an explicit portrayal.  Wells goes on to argue that the &quot;Cambrian Explosion&quot; of phyla refutes Darwin's gradualism.  The wealth of fossil impressions of PreCambrian soft-bodied creatures, which Wells blithely dismisses, show how Darwin's gradualism was in effect long before the Cambrian.  This issue alone reveals how poorly Wells has researched his book, since numerous studies on PreCambrian life have been published during the past twenty years.  He uses, of all people, Simon Conway Morris, to argue for the significance of the Cambrian, when that scholar's essential point was that the term &quot;Cambrian Explosion&quot; should be seriously reconsidered.<br />At the end, Wells turns to the ultimate evolutionary [and Christian creationist] issue, the emergence of humans.  After dragging the reader through the Piltdown scenario he clouds his text with the lack of &quot;proper&quot; fossils to substantiate human evolution from an ancient primate.  Without a clear line of fossil evidence there are many interpretations of human lineage.  That variety, however, doesn't refute the idea of human evolution, just its precise path.  Wells simplyignores the fossils demonstrating the options human evolution might have taken.<br />Wells concludes with an farcical assessment of textbooks dealing with evolutionary biology, &quot;flunking&quot; nearly all.  He stresses that &quot;as taxpayers&quot; Americans should see these texts abolished or fitted with &quot;warning labels&quot; acknowledging their adherence to his supposedly debunked &quot;icons&quot;.  In any other context, this would be considered silly, but the tactic exposes the threat Christian creationism poses to American education, whether in science or other fields.  Wells &quot;case&quot;, made up from misquotes, ignoring of evidence and misleading statements must be thoroughly exposed and dismissed.  That someone has taken the trouble to refute his contentions on a chapter by chapter basis is indicative of how badly conceived this book is.  If you feel compelled to read this, read the diagnoses of it as well.  The future of American education and your children depends on that effort.

It's &quot;foreign&quot; or &quot;the screws don't fit&quot; or some other phrase that distances it from what is still referred to as the &quot;English&quot; form of measurement.  Yet, as every other nation knows, nearly every nation uses it, including the rest of the Western Hemisphere.  Ken Alder, pandering to American prejudices has subtitled this book in a way designed to lure pro- and anti-metric readers alike.  Both will find comfort here, depending on what is sought in its pages.  That, alone, is testimony to the diligence he's used in relating the creation of the metre and the science surrounding it.<br />Alder's task was formidable.  He presents the personalities of the two prime figures that performed the Herculean task of measurement.  The two men were similar in some ways, wildly divergent in others.  Using Paris as a base, Delambre and Mechain struck out to measure, in effect, the diameter of the Earth to establish a piece of it as the basis for the new standard of measurement - the metre.  Alder places his figures and their mission firmly within their total environment.  Setting out under a royal commission, they are overtaken by the French Revolution.  Part of the background of that upheaval was the Enlightenment - the age in which traditions were questioned and new ideas about the world and the universe were proposed.  From this distance of time, everything appears to have fallen into place.  Alder, however, shows that not only were answers only being teased from Nature, it was becoming obvious that many necessary questions had yet to be asked.<br />With a clever narrative style, he portrays the mentally tortured Mechain in agonies over what appears to be an insurmountable error - irreconcilable readings of latitude even after the most careful surveys.  He keeps the true secret - a far more fundamental error than poor equipment or bad methodology - until late in the book.  Through the story, however, Alder explains the views of the Enlightenment scientists - which he calls &quot;savants&quot;, a term rarely used these days - and their struggles to establish and maintain what we now call &quot;the scientific method&quot;.  Do the research, then do it again.  Confirm, repeat, verify, seek endorsement from others.  Science, in a word, is an arduous task, not to be undertaken lightly nor performed inattentively.  Alder does science a great service in his descriptions.  While perfection, precision and accuracy are terms easily bandied about, Alder takes the time and trouble to explain their true meanings and why we must use them carefully.  And accurately.<br />Many will grouse about Alder's pedantic style, but he demonstrates that this work goes far beyond the correctness of the platinum bar locked away in a Parisian vault.  Science is important and more people need to recognize that fact.  Alder points out that the success of the metre was not a scientific achievement, but a political one.  As governments recovering from the Napoleonic Empire regained hegemony, they recognized the efficiency of centralised forms of administration.  With the metre carefully established, the Low Countries, Italy, Spain and the colonies of them all adopted the metric system as a vast improvement over the chaos of the ancien regime.<br />Alder is far too clever to launch a promotion on why America should move to metric.  He knows his countrymen, and cites some of the arguments used against the standard.  He notes the Ohio legislator that condemned metric without mentioning that it was Ohio that once considered changing the value of pi to the whole number 3 and is now entertaining the irrational concept of &quot;intelligent design&quot; creationism.  No matter how carefully he shields it, he presents the adoption of metric globally as a vivid message.  Only America, among the world's leading nations, stands alone in a resistance without reason.

As a trade negotiator [among his other talents], he utilises history, a knowledge of current conditions and assess likely future trends to accomplish his goals.  He certainly displays those skills, coupled with a fluent writing style, in this warning of America weakening itself with self-inflicted wounds.  He is a global traveller and a keen sampler of opinion.  His general conclusion is that, as individuals, Americans are liked, even respected.  As a nation, expressing policies in the international arena, America is worse than a &quot;loose cannon&quot; - it's a nation blundering dangerously out of control.  America makes decisions heedless of its neighbours near or far.  And too many of those decisions appear arbitrary and self-contradictory.  Prestowitz, even as a defender of his nation, glosses over nothing.  That approach grants him a credibility that his past political and economic orientation might have eroded.<br />The author wants Americans to consider how others view them.  Military power and imperial arrogance, coupled with an extravagant lifestyle, inhibit caring about others' opinions, he admits.  Survival, he asserts, makes the effort essential.  He contrasts the typical day of an American cotton planter with that of his African equivalent.  It's a stark comparison.  Americans may console themselves with the apparently stumbling efforts of the European Union and the strength of the single currency.  Prestowitz reminds us that to Europeans, the goals are clear and will be achieved, even if the journey isn't initially smooth.  America, by contrast, relies on a dollar losing adherents and an international policy of &quot;America only&quot;.<br />Prestowitz carefully and clearly provides the background for nearly every major policy decision made by administrations since the end of World War II.  Instead of simply lambasting the Bush administration for unilateralism, the author carefully and clearly outlines the roots of policies and national attitudes.  His approach thus encompasses more than just Dubya's short-sighted ploys by showing how deeply some American policies are ingrained by past actions.  That neither justifies their unnatural persistence, nor prevents change, according to Prestowitz.  All that is really needed, it seems, is to read this book, understand its message, and demand change from policy makers.  That sounds deceptively simple, but reading Prestowitz shows that change can be accomplished by listening, understanding and acting.  Read this, understand his aims, and express what you've learned.

Another author sets Papal politics in a post-nuclear holocaust society and it's dubbed &quot;Sci-fi&quot;, and tossed in the remainders bin.  Neither book deserved the fate it received.  Miller's second look at post-nuclear North American society reveals a church divided within and still struggling with Caesar after three millennia.  Popes tend to church politics with one hand and civil society with another.  Somewhere in the middle are the lesser religious tending their adherents or hiding from the conflicts.<br />One such &quot;lesser religious&quot; is a monk, Blacktooth St George.  A resident at the monastery long dedicated to the memory of Isaac Leibowitz, nuclear scientist and martyr, Blacktooth harbours doubts about his calling.  His roots are from the Plains people and their pagan heritage conflicts with the Roman Catholic Church's ideal of monotheism and self-sacrifice.  Attempting to shed the burdensome vows, Blacktooth is conscripted to the service of a lawyer cardinal.  Elia Brownpony, too, is a former Plainsman, but has risen quickly in the Church hierarchy due to diplomatic talents.  Diplomacy usually involves conspiracy, and Brownpony must be adept at both for he is struggling to reunite the broken church.  Theology isn't the basis of the schism, however.  The expanding empire of Texark has challenged the Pope's power.  Brownpony, wheeling and dealing, uses Blacktooth as a major instrument.<br />Politics are a lesser challenge to Blacktooth than the condition of his own spirit.  Beset by visions and his glands alike, this mid-thirties adult is known as Nimmy, an appellation applied to young boys.  He encounters a genetic mutant, a heritage of the holocaust, whose only flaws are an uncanny insight and a rampant libido.  She seduces Nimmy, who doesn't quite break his vows, and supposedly produces two children.  Her image haunts him as he goes about his role of personal assistant.  He's also haunted by the multi-figured image of a pope of African descent.  All these conflicting visions keep Blacktooth on edge and in peril.  His reconciliation of all these disparate forces are the theme of Miller's &quot;midquel&quot; of Canticle for Leibowitz [this story commences at the middle of Canticle, not the end].<br />Swirling roles of church and state and the Church and the individual formed the basis of &quot;Canticle&quot;.  Expanded and enhanced in this book, they are nicely integrated with convulsions that shook the Roman Catholic Church after the 1960s.  Bisson has done Miller's original draft proud in completing a compelling story of the pressures on faith.  Through a complex plot, the characters are kept realistic, if somewhat bizarre.

Expanded and enhanced in this book, they are nicely integrated with convulsions that shook the Roman Catholic Church after the 1960s.  Bisson has done Miller's original draft proud in completing a compelling story of the pressures on faith.  Through a complex plot, the characters are kept realistic, if somewhat bizarre.  Religious institutions, particularly under stress, are never simple, and the complexities are well handled and you never lose the threads, no matter how tightly they seem tangled.

A long-time scholar of &quot;paranormal&quot; phenomena, he is well suited to examine and explain the foundations for belief in the irrational.  A skeptical critic and insightful observer, he brings many years of experience to present this assessment of the &quot;paranormal&quot;.  He is anxious to dispel the emotional delusions of supposedly extrasensory experiences.  Such events must not overwhelm reason, he argues.  In this well-written and researched book, Humphrey examines how science has addressed and answered many questions over the centuries.<br />Religions and quasi-religions, he contends, are nurturing and explanatory medicinal packages for &quot;orphaned minds&quot;.  Seeking consolation, distressed people will cling to such weak reeds with desperate intensity.  Attempts to assert rationality over many years have been repulsed or constrained by those who had easy answers to probing questions.  The easy answer has always been found outside the realm of nature - the &quot;super&quot;-natural.  While these answers are nearly universal, Humphrey focusses on Western European traditions and illusions.  Of these, naturally, it is the Christ story which claims his attention.<br /> Humphrey's handling of the Messiah phenomenon is unique.  Jesus, instead of a &quot;redeemer&quot;, is portrayed as a skillful conjurer from a young age.  Using modern child prodigies as models, Humphrey suggests that Jesus, too, exhibited extraordinary talents in childhood.  These need not have been &quot;supernatural&quot;, but they certainly garnered attention.  Following the example of a father-son mutually reinforcing alliance to perform &quot;spoon-bending&quot; feats, he suggests Jesus was the victim of a &quot;virtuous circle&quot; of family and friends encouraging him.  While those in his home town remained skeptical, Jesus' talents in sleight-of-hand were applauded elsewhere.  The acclaim grew widespread enough that even non-Christian paranormal practitioners rely on the model Jesus established.  It's a compelling idea, both in accepting an historical Jesus while explaining how supposedly irrational events can gain wide-spread acceptance.<br />Readers are well-served by Humphrey's efforts to shunt the paranormal aside and replace it with analytical considerations of miracles, &quot;psychic&quot; phenomena and charlatanry.  These habits are too easily ingrained into common thinking simply because they fulfill a desire to envision a future.  Science, according to Humphrey, has failed to address the paranormal so as not to give it the credibility of attention.  Perhaps a full-scale campaign, he contends, would dispel the myths and leave the gullible public in a more enlightened state.  It would, he suggests, help dispel the disquieting view so much of the public has of science.  Whether to understand the paranormal's tactics or to see why it should be fully discounted, this book is an excellent analysis of a dubious topic.

It is the finest of several analogous efforts published over two decades.  With penetrating insight, he presents the full range of Christian creationist ideologies, many self contradictory.  He examines how slandering Darwin's concept of natural selection [\\"evolution\\"] goes beyond biology.  The real issue, he assures us, is the curtailing of the liberalisation of American society.  In well-crafted prose, the author maintains your interest in a subject at once hilarious and terrifying.  He declares that the issue is greater than religion versus science.  It is one striking at the very root of American ideals.<br /><br />The book provides a general history of 20th Century \\"creationism\\", its programme and its proponents.  The later \\"Intelligent Design\\" movement, which declares itself a \\"science\\" instead of a religious concept, Pennock declares a sham.  Its influence is far too great, yet built from shoddy materials.  Tracing the ideas and publications of such figures as Henry Morris and his followers, Pennock describes the propaganda techniques of the Institute for Creation Research and the recent wave material camouflaged under \\"scientific\\" or \\"legal\\" disguises.  Pennock pores over their material, pinpointing their fallacies and exposing their tactics.  He shows how evidence is ignored or twisted, explaining how ideology governs speeches, publications and strategy.  Through it all, he shows how the Christians are as much at war with each other as they are with \\"materialism\\", the label they apply to Darwinian scholars.<br /><br />Pennock adopts the unique method of showing how the evolution of languages repeats the biological pattern.  From an original, lost language, modern tongues evolved in different environments.  It continues to evolve today.  It's a fitting analogy, one which teachers should note and apply in the classroom.  It's appropriate that a scholar of Pennock's stature should thus ally science with the humanities.  As he points out, much of the assault on biological evolution could easily be applied to farming, home life and law.<br /><br />The author examines some of the renowned figures of the IDC cabal with a penetrating gaze.  Pennock charitably skims over Michael Behe's ignorance of evolutionary process to focus on lawyer Phil Johnson.  Johnson's legal training prompts him to address all questions in absolutes and to create straw men as easily demolished targets.  Pennock simply dissects Johnson's writings to demonstrate not only false assumptions, but contradictions so severe as to inspire the reader to wonder how he maintains his academic position.  According to Pennock, Johnson's works betray a messianic mentality from which he institutes a project to redeem American society.  It's to Pennock's credit that the term \\"demagogue\\" doesn't appear in the text.  One can only admire his forbearance.<br /><br />Pennock's patience must have been stretched in undertaking the research to produce this book.  He has debated Darwin's defamers, suffered through the morass of creationist publications and endured the assault on evidence unashamedly displayed at the creationists' museum.  It can hardly be beaten as an exercise in mental self-flagellation.  Yet, this book results in a mine of information, reasoned analysis and fine exposition.

From the start, he writes, he was &quot;encouraged to interrogate, to investigate&quot;.  With this mandate, he spent his childhood interrogating the history of science and scientists.  He investigated the nature of chemicals, learned magnetism and electricity, and, in preparation for his anticipated medical career, probed into the mysteries of the body.  This exquisite and frank account traces Sacks' boyhood in London - with side pauses to the schools attended - exposing his fears and ambitions with equal fervour.<br />Sacks' quest for knowledge mainly focussed on chemical elements and compounds, with metals dominating his attention.  &quot;Uncle Tungsten&quot; [his uncle Dave] owned a lamp factory and provided both advice and materials.  Sacks drew heavily on his expertise, but Dave often left him to experiment on his own.  With a highly inquisitive mind and a drive to learn, Oliver often duplicated the research performed by notable figures of science to achieve the same ends.  This technique provided great insight into the scientific method, allowing him to manufacture chemicals that might have been purchased at a nearby shop.<br />He learns the scientists' techniques through the blizzard of printed paper he plowed through during those years.  Biographies, autobiographies, published journals and notebooks, all were his reading fare throughout his boyhood.  He reminds us of the hazards of research from the burned hands and faces from potassium to the still-radioactive notebooks of Marie Curie, today stored in lead boxes.  Setting up a laboratory in a back room of the family home, he followed their reasoning, their sense of discovery, and their techniques as he made bangs, smells, brilliant lights and beautiful crystals.  His biological endeavours were often less successful.  He and his chums once drove the inhabitants of a house away for months until the noxious odour of rotting cuttlefish could be exorcised.<br />Although Sacks introduces a wealth of scientific information from a broad sweep of sources, there is not a dull page in this book.  He describes the techniques to isolate elements in vivid detail, and you find yourself sharing the researcher's frustration to achieve the goal along with the exhilaration when success is achieved.  You follow Sacks willingly as he plods through the museums and into shops buying chemicals.  Mostly, you watch him as he begs Uncle Dave for materials or sits spellbound as &quot;Uncle Tungsten&quot; describes the properties of metals.  Sacks' joys at &quot;re-learning&quot; what others have done is infectious - he leaves you longing to repeat the experiments for yourself - only to learn, of course, that today's caution has sequestered the materials away to prevent you blundering into harm.  That's a sad testimony, but Sacks' journey through time and place remains for us to gain some sense of what it must be like to undertake scientific adventures.

Well written and lavishly illustrated, the book covers a wide range of topics in explaining how we perceive and what our brains do about the observations.  Carter is as fully conversant with traditional philosophical questions as she is with the recent discoveries in cognitive science.  Where she can, she relates the detailed science with clarity and insight.  In presenting more generalised overviews, she proves a master of metaphor, keeping the issues before the reader and incorporating research findings into the narrative.  As a starting point for consciousness studies, the book is outstanding.<br />The fundamental question underlying this book is the &quot;hard problem&quot; - how to define and explain &quot;consciousness&quot;.  Carter recognizes that we all have our own beliefs about our own mental states.  Her aim, however, is to encourage us to question what appears obvious.  Most definitions of &quot;consciousness&quot; are circular, mostly from lack of precision.  The precision should be obtainable - over thirty thousand papers have been published on the topic during the past decade alone.  The text offers approaches to investigating the &quot;hard problem&quot; and summarises what conclusions have been reached so far.  Carter is frank in explaining that final answers are elusive, encouraging further investigation and analysis.  Her approach in dealing with these questions is to pose them, introduce the thinking of others on the topic, then draw her own conclusions.  The technique is informative and has the further advantage of avoiding polemics.  Sometimes, she even referees the clashes of some scholars.<br />In presenting the view of various researchers, she introduces snippets of their thinking.  The samplings are a prime example of how the border between philosopy and cognitive science has blurred in recent years.  Each of the contributions illustrates a major contributor to modern cognitive science.  In some cases the views are sharply divergent on the same topic, so Carter aligns them for direct comparison.  These insertions present a difficult problem for the reader, as a decision must be made to stop and review these mini-essays, or continue on to return to them later.  They all bear close scrutiny and deserve reader follow-up.  Carter has chosen her samples well, although of necessity, the collection cannot be complete.<br />The illustrations bring this book near the &quot;coffee table&quot; class, but the information is far superior to common examples of that genre.  Regrettably, the chapter lead graphics are purely interpretative, adding nothing to the information.  Further, these extravagant graphics must certainly add unnecessary cost to this book.

The writer must try to make each book, especially the middle book, stand alone.  Yet he must also carry the underlying narrative through the story and lead to the final volume.  Readers, particularly new ones, must take the risk that the second volume is worth the investment in time and money.  Bear marginally succeeds in making this book stand on its own merits by giving us sufficient background threads as the story progresses.  Thankfully, he doesn't use tedious flashbacks to achieve this end.  Reprises are helpful to the new reader, but can be hopelessly boring to someone who's read a first volume.  This compelling speculation on how evolution might work carries over from the previous volume, Darwin's Radio.  It isn't necessary to have read the first volume, but it simplifies the understanding of the characters.<br />In this sequel, the life of the new generation of SHEVA \\"virus children\\" is portrayed.  The children discover what it means to be \\"different\\" in American society.  They learn how vicious a reaction to the different can become.  The SHEVA children are shunted out of sight in camps the Nazis would have envied.  Among these children growing up in such an environment is Stella Nova, offspring of two of the key figures in the earlier book.  Like the other children, she remains a fugitive, even when living at home.  Children as outcasts is one of the greatest forms of tragedy, and Bear is adept at the portrayal.<br />Bear weaves the feelings of both child and parent with sensitive skill.  Isolation of the SHEVA children, as it's done with other children in similar situations, results in a new identity.  New feelings and a new language develop both from the children's isolation and from talents their genetic heritage grants them.  They have powerful senses of smell - they use pheromones as a form of communication.  These all combine to create a fresh sense of community in the children.  They form \\"demes\\" - an incipient social structure.  How will the new groupings relate with the previous society is a question Bear opens, but doesn't resolve.  Partly this is due to the SHEVA children's youth.  Although some are close to maturity, the  new arrangement is only beginning.  Self-awareness of differences, however, is strong.  Stella Nova forcefully declares to her parents, \\"I'm not like you!\\".<br />As outlandish as this may sound, Bear's science foundation for this story is impeccable.  While he's careful in a \\"Short Biological Primer\\" at the end of the book to identify what's known and what is speculation, it's clear nothing here is implausible.  The results of an extensive literature search permeates the book - sometimes in overwhelming detail.  Do we really need to know how many different compounds can be used to re-hydrate a mammal?<br />That specious criticism aside, there is much value to be gained reading Bear's \\"middle volume\\" in this trilogy.  The social issues are combined with business concerns and, of course, the political realm.  What will be the legal position of children tucked away in concentration camps?  More to the point, what is the mental make-up of the new children?  One of the major characters provides a hint through a series of epiphanies she experiences.  There seems to be a strong need for speculative fiction writers to re-introduce us to gods, and Bear is following this pattern both in the plot and in a \\"Caveats\\" essay concluding the book.  It is mildly astonishing that such an issue is likely to form the basis for the third book.  However,  the question is left dangling so precipitously at the end, it must be resolved somehow.

Studying the wonders of nature, whether of the past or present, brings together people with common interests.  In this book Grady relates the events taking place in the 1980s and '90s when Chinese and Canadian paleontologists undertook a major project to dispel some of the mysteries of dinosaur evolution.  Well researched and superbly written, Grady here displays the writing skills that would propel him to become one of Canada's foremost science journalists.<br />The Canada-China Dinosaur Project was considered by most of its participants as a resurrection of work begun many years ago.  Roy Chapman Andrews, adventurer, researcher, promoter, went to China in the 1920s seeking evidence of human origins.  Instead he stunned the world by finding dinosaur eggs.  Interruptions of revolution, wars cold and hot and slim communications links prevented proper follow-up on Andrews finds.  Phil Currie and Dale Russell, Canadian paleontologists, sought to identify links that might show relationships between Asian and North American dinosaurs.  Grady traces their efforts, following the teams from Mongolian deserts to bleak Arctic islands.  There are personality clashes, disputes over resources and inadequate equipment.  In the end, the broader needs of good science overcame the petty hindrances and the Project proved an astounding success.<br />Grady reviews the search for fossils in the Canadian west in opening the tale.  In the late 19th Century, the Alberta Badlands were a magnet for fossil hunters.  In some places you might trip over fossils recently revealed by soil erosion.  Ultimately, the finds led to preserves and the now-famous Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology outside Drumheller.  Currie took up the idea of the joint-nation project in the spirit of Carl Sagan's Russian-American Soyuz space project.  Currie called it &quot;dinosaurs for peace.&quot;  A decade of cooperative research, according to Grady, paid enormous dividends for science.  The evidence proved another verification that Asia and the Americas were joined in the ancient past.<br />Grady's fine writing is further graced by numerous photographs and maps.  In reminding us that the geography [and geology] of Canada and China are similar, he reinforces that view with excellent photographs.  There are maps of the areas with exploratory routes indicated.  The scale, necessarily small, cannot fully convey the distances travelled in search of fossils.  Added to these illustrations are excellent diagrams of the dinosaurs in skeleton and body plan.  In all this book is a trove of information, feeling and discovery.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]arch, according to Grady, paid enormous dividends for science.

Those who know his work will be prepared for innovative thinking, excellent prose style and realistic characters.  Underlying those skills will be his insistence that the scientific and technical base of his stories will be solid.  This collection, covering several years of short story publication, is vivid testimony to his abilities.  Nearly two dozen sterling pieces demonstrate why Sawyer is at the top rank among speculative fiction writers.  Each is introduced by a commentary on about the story's inspiration or publication history.  He has his own favourites, but ranking them is strictly a reader's pleasant task.<br />The title piece, &quot;Iterations&quot; is illustrative of Sawyer's conceptual reach.  The issue of &quot;alternative&quot; universes is a topic of active debate among physicists.  It's one Sawyer has dealt with elsewhere.  Beyond the question of how they can come about, there are social issues that arise.  If we learn to detect alternative spheres of existence, what human judgments are likely to follow.  This story enters that murky realm with vivid imagination and solid logic.  What decisions might you have to make if you discovered there were other versions of you?<br />Even deeper social issues are considered in &quot;Just Like Old Times&quot;.  As lifespans extend through better health services and a larger work force retires early, what decisions will have to be made to protect depleting resources.  While this question seems a departure from the normal run of &quot;speculative fiction&quot; [and Sawyer rarely strays into the arena of &quot;space opera&quot;] he uses this to raise some disturbing questions.  In this story of justice, time travel [except not really] and a disturbed human psyche, Sawyer demonstrates how the unanticipated can result in the best intentions running wild.  In some respects, this tale could fit just as easily in the &quot;horror&quot; genre due to its conclusion.<br />Rather than draw you through a turgid exposition of Sawyer's imagination, pick up this book and find out for yourself.  Those who still feel &quot;SF&quot; is a minority genre could learn much from this collection.  Speculative fiction offers opportunities to stimulate thinking about many questions in many ways.  Even better, if offers some fresh questions to consider.  Sawyer is a master at getting at the heart of issues considered but fleetingly by most.

The fragile nature of that lever truly is the theme of this book.  By assembling a team of scientists from various fields of study, the editors have fashioned a comprehensive picture of many elements comprising human culture.  Structuring the book around themes of universal interest, they establish a sound scientific base for a difficult topic.  While the book is intended for an academic audience, the editors have chosen their authors carefully.  The material isn't buried in arcane language.  The authors use clear, straightforward prose in presenting their evidence.  It's important to remember that it is evidence, not mere speculation, that is being offered in these articles.<br />The editors set the theme of &quot;applying a rigorous Darwinian analysis&quot; to human culture in their Introduction.  They remind us that this is a topic that has long eluded a disciplined investigation.  Darwinian approaches to human evolution are difficult, but the editors contend that solid research offers insights previous scholars have ignored or not attempted.  Their selection of three major themes, society, language, art and religion, allows them to demonstrate how these areas reflect the evolutionary process in our species.<br />To recount the eleven essays here would effectively re-write the book.  There are pieces  dealing with various forms of symbolism, the application of cooperation and altruism, and courting behaviour.  The authors frequently remind us that evolution goes far beyond mere &quot;survival&quot;.  A mulititude of elements interplay in determining which individuals are &quot;fittest&quot; in the human environment.  Art, for example, has many roots, and &quot;body painting&quot; is but one of many of them.  In Camilla Powers' essay, she demonstrates how mating rituals, community organisation and colour recognition work together to build art forms and social structure.  Religion, an item of intense debate, is skillfully examined in Steven Mithen's essay on how humans came to devise the idea of the supernatural.  He suggests that the idea of a &quot;supernatural&quot; being arose with the maturation of human cognition.  Religion, therefore, arose not as a survival trait, but merely as an extension of human cognitive capability.<br />The information offered in each essay is thoroughly referenced at the end of the piece.  There are illustrative charts and graphics summarising the information in the text.  In all, this collection will stand for some time as a foundation for further work.

He suggests that the idea of a &quot;supernatural&quot; being arose with the maturation of human cognition.  Religion, therefore, arose not as a survival trait, but merely as an extension of human cognitive capability.<br />The information offered in each essay is thoroughly referenced at the end of the piece.

Natural selection and morals?  Michael Ruse's penetrating survey deftly handles these contentious topics.  In this superbly conceived and illuminating book, he presents the foundations of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.  He goes on to explain how the long-standing philosophical questions can be addressed through a better understanding of evolution.  Ruse accepts evolution as a fact, asserting we must reconsider traditional concepts to adapt to that reality.  While he uses biological examples to illustrate some of his points, the important theme is to adjust our thinking.  Clearly, he reminds us, evolution is more than a mechanical process.  We must understand it in order to comprehend ourselves and to address our own future in a rational manner.<br />Many have attempted to engage in that process with varying degrees of success.  He explores the realm of evolutionary epistomology - how theories of knowledge were changed by Darwinism.  How has it been applied in human affairs?  Here Ruse displays his excellence in addressing this fundamental issue.  His strengths as a philosopher and Darwinist are combined to explain Darwin's idea in light of human experience.  Not many historical commentators have been successful at this enterprise for various reasons.  Natural selection usurped the notion of a divinity guiding nature's course.  What then, could be considered a replacement for divine intervention?  Philosophers such as Herbert Spencer replaced divine guidance with the notion that evolution was a progressive force.  There was a goal to the process, and that goal in his view [and that of many others] was the evolution of humans.<br />Humanity's intellect led to issues of ethics and morals - we could pose questions about the value of life and how we interact with one another.  What is humanity's place in the world?  What, if anything, is beyond what we can perceive?  Although many philosophers and commentators permeate this study, the figures of Immanuel Kant and David Hume loom large.  Kant, of course, finally concluded that a divine must be present as a prime source for human values.  Hume's stress on empiricism was more applicable in a Darwinian view of the world.  Yet, Ruse stresses, none of these thinkers was able to address &quot;fundamental&quot; questions realistically, since they lacked the information the Darwinian Revolution set in motion.<br />None of these thinkers were able to address questions of morality and ethics in a Darwinian sense.  Ruse, himself, takes up that challenge resolving it successfully.  He cites the new generation of studies centred on evolutionary psychology.  The application of game theory, modern genetics and kinship altruism are carefully explained and applied to the human condition.  Ruse is an effective narrator is presenting the various arguments that have been set forth by various philosophers.  He's attentive to central themes and provides them in meaningful fashion.  He points out where the proposals break down and why.  In the end, there is one man who stands above all contenders.  That man, of course, is Darwin himself.<br />Given the nature of the material, this is a book to be read with care.  Although Ruse's style is clear and unambiguous, the concepts are important.  He gives them due recognition and explains them fully.  But these are not topics that can be glossed over with a simplistic style.  Ruse does an excellent job, giving this book a unique place in evolutionary studies.  Thoroughly researched and ably crafted, it's a welcome effort.

Rocco, herself a victim of this dread illness, narrates its impact from ancient times into the modern world.  When the death of a pope brought 55 cardinals to Rome to replace Gregory XV, 10 of them had contracted malaria within two weeks.  Those who survived returning to Sees in European nations spread further a malady already prevalent in many nations as distant as the British Isles and Scandinavia.  Even as the papal successor, who was also prostrated with chills and fever, struggled to survive the infection, some of his minions were advocating a likely cure against great skepticism.<br />Jesuit missionaries in the New World discovered Native Americans using a powdered tree bark to treat fevers and \\"agues\\".  Sending the powder back to Catholic Europe introduced the first therapy for malaria, probably just as these same interlopers were infesting the Western Hemisphere with the parasite.  Cinchona powder, diluted in wine to cover its bitterness, verged on the miraculous.  As Rocco describes its effect, she also recounts the resistance to the \\"Jesuit powder\\" in Protestant Europe, particularly Britain.  Lack of enthusiasm, plus military ineptness, led to a malarial onslaught in 1808, when an English attempt to invade Napoleon's empire ended in disaster.<br />Empire, war and malaria remained in close company throughout the 19th Century.  British incursions into west Africa were stalled by the infection.  At one point the medical records indicated more cases of malaria than there were settlers - due to repeat hospital patients.  Even against this severity, progress was being made.  It's said \\"there's always one\\" and Rocco shows how one dedicated man made an immense difference.  On a voyage up the Niger, Baikie imposed a strict daily regimen of quinine dosage.  One of his crew was murdered and one drowned - but none were lost to malaria.<br />Returning to the Western Hemisphere, Rocco describes the inept handling of fevers by the in the American Civil War.  Vicksburg, she asserts, failed to be taken due to the Union's lack of quinine for its troops investing the city.  Even greater disaster awaited the French in their attempt to link the Atlantic and Pacific with a Panama Canal.  Instead of treating the workers, the French merely hid the casualty list and hired replacements.  Even as late as World War II, battlegrounds in the Pacific highlighted the need for plentiful supplies of quinine.  By that time, however, some synthetics had been developed.  Malaria, however, is neither easily diagnosed nor treated.  Rocco notes that there are several versions of the illness, and many varieties of cinchona.  Matching them takes skill.<br />At the end of the 19th Century, malaria had been identified as a parasite, not the effusion of swampy fumes.  Rocco describes the labours of British Army doctor Ronald Ross, who laboured under appalling conditions in India.  He traced the course of the parasite, in part by dissecting mosquitoes with a razor blade!  This new understanding led to more directed treatment, and, ultimately, a Nobel Prize for Ross.  Rocco's diagram of the life cycle of the parasite suggests the complexity of the problem of diagnosis and therapy.<br />Rocco concludes with a reminder that malaria identified is not malaria eliminated.  It kills millions of children every year and prostrates whole communities.  South American forests were denuded by exploiters seeking the bark.  The synthetics developed proved a temporary solution since the parasite appears to have evolved resistance to them.  Today's chief source of natural quinine is a threatened forest in war-torn central Africa.  She describes the travails of a firm struggling to maintain supply.  The picture would be encouraging if the firm obtained support from industrial nations.  That hasn't been forthcoming.<br />Rocco's opening sentence, \\"My grandparents had been married for many years when they left Europe for Africa - although not to each other\\" sets the tone of this book.  Her personalised narrative form skips the use of footnotes, but there are Notes on Sources and a Further Reading list.  A collection of photos and maps adds reference.

After all, we consider humans the most important member of the animal kingdom.  A quick perusal of Chapter 15, &quot;The Evolution of Human Behavior&quot;, introduces you to many issues within that topic.  The question that must arise, is &quot;how did we get to be that way?&quot;.  To answer that question, simply turn to page 1 and start reading.  The rewards gained by following John Alcock's presentation are beyond measure.  He's an outstanding researcher and analyst.  His writing demonstrates the importance of understanding why this book is necessary for both professional and novice.  The behavioural traits he explains show the workings of evolution.  We are but one of the products of that process.<br />Stating that Darwin's concept of evolution was a &quot;blockbuster&quot; of an idea, he argues it illuminates everything once you have the courage to look.  He uses the concept of &quot;proximate&quot; and &quot;ultimate&quot; causes in analysing traits and deriving their origins.  What we see in nature are the &quot;proximate&quot; causes of behaviour - how do a moth's muscles make the wings move in a particular way?  The &quot;ultimate&quot; cause is what, if anything is gained by the action or behaviour?  Answering the second question leads to a probable explanation of how evolution brought the feature about.  Traits are the result of a long series of tiny steps leading to what is seen today.  Alcock demonstrates that there are many influences affecting the course of evolution.<br />Alcock presents an array of examples neatly arranged in groupings such as environmental impact, heredity, mating and feeding.  How does the ungainly seaslug discern predator approach and how does it escape?  Why do so many male birds sing, and so few females?  How do night-flying moths evade the sonar-equipped bat?  Why is the Monarch butterfly so brilliant in colour while other butterflies and moths seem drab and muted?  How do we recognize faces?  The underlying question in each example is whether the observed property is a beneficial adaptation.<br />Every trait is subject to a balance of &quot;benefits&quot; and &quot;costs&quot; - camouflage to hide from predators may also cloak you from a possible mate.  Alcock examines this balance for many species, noting that some assessments remain in dispute.  Testing alternative hypotheses is a major sub-theme of this book.  Considering &quot;cost/benefit&quot; of human behaviours is only now being undertaken, but is just as applicable to us as to other animals.  What are the benefits of a social environment such as ours?  What are the costs involved in maintaining this type of existence?  One &quot;cost/benefit&quot; analysis is the evolution of &quot;helpers&quot;.  Humans long believed the rest of the animal world never exhibited altruism.  Yet, now it's known that &quot;assistance to others&quot; can range from adoption of offspring to a variety of reciprocal trade-offs of many types across many species.<br />Although this book is designed as a classroom text, the writing style, illustrative material and references make it a worthy purchase for anyone.  At first glance the cost of this book seems staggering.  Looking at the bibliography, however, suggests you could spend this figure many times over in detailed studies.  Alcock presents the work of many researchers, summarising it effectively.  Further examination of a single topic is easier with the &quot;head start&quot; Alcock offers in many topics.  The value of this book is inestimable and Alcock's frequent upgrades ensure you will be kept abreast of recent findings.  With luck and effort, you might even contribute some of your own.

Decorating it with meaningless baubles to enhance appearance, broken glass and shell pieces add visual attraction, but not strength.  An impressive effort, designed to lure another Bowerbird by its delightful display, the bower is abandoned after mating.  It's still dazzling, but meaningless.  This book rather emulates that bower of straw and glitter.  Gould's prose skills, sometimes entertaining and often informative, fail here.  Worse, his theme is misdirected and his points so cluttered with arcane or self-serving asides, you begin to wonder why the book was written.  His title is a circumlocution - the hedgehog being a single-purpose plodder contending with the more flexible and enterprising fox.<br />Gould begins claiming that historians label the 17th Century as &quot;The Scientific Revolution&quot;, when most scholars apply the broader &quot;The Enlightenment&quot; to that era.  Having begun on a false note, Gould then builds a dichotomy using a succession of writers, many lost to sight today.  That, of course, was Gould's specialty - the restoration of forgotten literary, philosophical or scientific figures.  He calls upon this phalanx to show how science and the humanities have diverged.  Science, &quot;the upstart&quot; competed for pride of place against the &quot;long-established&quot; studies of the humanities.  Science, the &quot;hedgehog&quot; with its narrow focus on facts, eschewed the sweeping assertions of the humanities - the &quot;fox&quot;.  Over the centuries, the divergence grew as the objective pursuit of evidence proved ill-adapted in philosophical studies.  He repeatedly notes that many early scientists were theologians, merging his two &quot;magisteria&quot; of science and religion [He ignores the fact that education of any type remained in the hands of churches, Roman Catholic or Protestant, until very recently].<br />Although he offers a feeble statement of intent at the opening of the book, it is well into the text before we are confronted with the book's purpose.  That, simply stated, is another assault on the father of sociobiology, Edward O. Wilson.  Gould attempts to invalidate the thesis of Wilson's book &quot;Consilience&quot; in which he urged that science and the humanities must merge.  Wilson's argument rests on the idea that science's methodology will inevitably demonstrate its usefulness to the humanities.  The two will come together in a &quot;new science of the humanities&quot; with both sacrificing some elements while adopting others across disciplines.  Gould offers a largesse of faint praise to Wilson's ambitious effort, but in the last analysis simply declares he can't agree with Wilson's proposal.  His disagreement rests, as it has for a generation, on his failure to accept evolutionary roots for human thinking and behaviour.  The research achieved during that generation is loftily ignored.  &quot;Separate but equal&quot; was Gould's aim.  He's offered the rationale before - science and the humanities can operate in harness - &quot;e plurbus unum&quot; [of course!] but retain separate identities.  He leaves to others how to bring this coalition of the willing about.  It's a shame this final statement of a fine writer exhibits such a paucity of reasoned consideration.

901865:US	50941451	RM36CO0DO9S0G	0312876904	943424422	Hybrids (Neanderthal Parallax)	Books	5	4	8	N	N	Requires rust-proofing	Sawyer's title gives the game away up front.  Those not having read the previous works in this trilogy will quickly learn of the romance between a human geneticist and a Neanderthal physicist.  Mary Vaughn, genetics researcher and rape victim, has cast aside the prejudicial image we hold of extinct \\"cave men\\".  She dearly loves Ponter Boddit, who has crossed a quantum portal from an alternative universe.  Ponter represents the high scientific level Neanderthals might have achieved had they not been driven to extinction by the rise of another hominid - Homo sapiens.  These two species having been thoroughly introduced in the previous volumes, the ultimate result of their encounter must be the conception of a child - a hybrid human-Neanderthal.<br />The genetic obstacle to this breeding exercise gives Sawyer the opportunity to display his research abilities.  How he resolves it is testimony to his writing skills.  Humans, he tells us, are unique in possessing 23 chromosomes.  Other primates, probably including the extinct Neanderthals, have 24.  Merging genes from two such creatures is unlikely to produce viable offspring.  Sawyer however, has no intention of boring you with clinical issues when there are bigger questions to address.  Neanderthals are not only genetically distinct, their social structure differs in ways that would give a sociologist nightmares.  Males and females live apart except for a brief period each month - Two Becoming One.  Living apart means that each gender \\"bonds\\" with another of its kind for most of the month.  Intrusions on this rigid social ideal aren't welcome, and Mary's  insistence that couples \\"live together all the time\\" violates Neanderthal social mores.  Tensions build as human and Neanderthals interact.<br />Neanderthals possess an electronic avatar called a \\"Companion\\".  These ultimate PalmPilots communicate with one another and with a central recording station.  All actions, conversations, decisions are recorded for posterity, or adjudication, if required.  Adjudication has a long reach in both time and subject.  Violence, they believe, is a genetic trait.  The \\"sins of the fathers\\" are punished along lines of genetic relationships our society cast aside with the rise of Christianity.  If \\"Hybrids\\" falls into the hands of a \\"mainstream\\" fiction reader, the howls of \\"genetic determinism\\" will disturb Sawyer's Mississauga home.  However, there's an even bigger issue  in this book than justice through biology.  Neanderthals have no concept of deities or an afterlife.  Why do humans believe in gods but Neanderthals don't?<br />The question of \\"faith\\" builds as the central issue in this series.  Sawyer has flirted with it before, but never better than here.  His handling of the question is at once novel, entertaining and based on sound research.  Not only are Neanderthal and human chromosomes unalike, that condition reflects differences in brain structure.  Sawyer extends the findings of Canadian scientist Michael Persinger in coping with this question.  What gives humans a \\"religious sense\\"?  Is it really derived from the supernatural, or does some mechanism bring about faith - an \\"illness\\" subject to cure?  Ironies abound in this story, but none more potent than those Sawyer raises over this question.  What do we believe?  Why do we believe it?  How do we deal with the concept of gods?  There is no \\"rust-proofing\\" to cover the issue - Sawyer confronts you with it forcefully.  You must see through the ironies and address reality.<br />Can you read this book without having read the previous two in the trilogy?  Easily, if you can accept the notion of alternative universes joined by a quantum gateway.  Sawyer deals well with the advance in human cognition that supposedly occurred forty thousand years ago.  There are many ramifications branching off from this event and Sawyer handles them skilfully.  Sawyer doesn't write simply to entertain.  He writes to challenge your thinking, make you ponderthe validity of your beliefs and raise questions about how we view the world around us.  Read him and ask yourselves the questions.

His book on writing fiction, A Passion for Narrative, is among the finest of the genre.  It is unique in its consideration of Pacific Rim writing.  His latest novel, Distance, exhibits his extended outlook brilliantly.  &quot;Distance&quot; can impart many meanings and Hodgins weaves geographical and personal themes here with his usual skill.  &quot;Distance&quot; may be narrowed, and the issues of personal reconciliation and defining &quot;home&quot; are important ones in this book.<br />We follow Sonny Aalto from Ottawa to Vancouver Island, then across the Pacific.  There's even a side journey to the woods of Finland, his family's origins.  The journey confronts us with Sonny's family.  &quot;Confront&quot; is fraught with meaning, since Sonny's interactions with his family are tense and acerbic.  Pleasant words don't often appear and &quot;dislike&quot; is the mildest epithet available.  Yet the hostility is tempered with another side to all the characters.  Family life, no matter how conflict-filled, still carries an undercurrent of mutual respect and tenderness.  Sonny, who has strenuously resisted communicating with his father while seeking closer ties with his own children, is induced to return home.<br />Why is Sonny so frequently on the move?  He's spent a lifetime edging eastward, following various careers, seeking his children.  He travels incessantly - ruined cathedrals, shrines to pagan gods, remote villages.  The driving force is his father, Timo - &quot;Swampy&quot; Aalto.  Abandoned by his wife Viira, Timo, quite unprepared for the role, becomes a single parent.  In a remote corner of Vancouver Island, missing part of a leg, and virtually unemployable, he resents the role and his life.  Sonny is either left to his own devices or forced to clean up after Timo's drunken debauches with whichever women will tolerate him.  Leaving home wasn't a hard decision for Sonny.  Once departed, he just never stopped.  Ottawa is his latest refuge - &quot;he wanted to belong&quot; .  Will it be his last?<br />Skating the Rideau Canal on one of Ottawa's notorious February days, Sonny is confronted by a stranger claiming to be his brother.  &quot;Believe me, mate. I would not risk frozen gonads for a prank!&quot;  Jerrod has travelled half way around the planet to deliver an invitation: come to Australia and visit his mother.  And shoot boar - they kill sheep.  Sonny demurs.  He hasn't used a rifle in thirty years.  Far more significantly, he's uncertain how to deal with his long-vanished mother.  Lured to Victoria by his ailing father, the island continent beckons.  Timo, who has his own reasons to confront Viira, endorses the journey.  Crippled, seriously ill, he embraces the idea of the adventure.  Timo as a travelling companion is compounding risk.<br />Family relationships, especially those dominated by confrontation, make compelling reading.  Sonny has inherited his father's tendency to steer away from family ties - his son is &quot;up the Valley&quot; running a craft store while his daughter Charlotte returned to Vancouver pursuing a photographic career.  Charlotte scorns Sonny, while son Warren seems to communicate only to request money.  Under Jack Hodgins' perceptive eye and skilled narrative style, these characters become vividly staged in this engrossing tale.  The family gathering in the Australian bush becomes a cockpit of conflicting experiences and interests.  For all his mother-deprived upbringing, Sonny is a successful businessman.  He must hold his own against half-siblings, and on their home turf.  Hodgins doesn't invoke a false hero in Sonny, but there's strength and motives to persevere against stiff odds.  Timo also shows unexpected drive, his patriarchal role may be challenged, but rarely relinquished.<br />Hodgins' characters are finely drawn - he has a keen sense of details about people and their habitats.  His ability to convey idiosyncrasies of local speech borders on the uncanny.  You can hear the bushman's voice of Jerrold Hawkins.  Timo's irascibility echoes the stress of years struggling in Vancouver Island's own bush environment.  Sonny's firewood supplier's laconic observations reflecting life in the upper Ottawa Valley.  This isn't stereotyping, it's identification.<br />Hodgins draws more than characters.  In tracing Sonny's wanderings, each locale is characteristically depicted.

Residents of coastal cities or islands may consider moving to higher ground after Ian Frazier's revelations about retreating glaciers and their watery residue.<br />&quot;Science and Nature Writing&quot; allows many subject options.  Dawkins has chosen well and in a timely fashion for this anthology.  It would be redundant to assess the writing styles - all of these pieces are compelling, informative and presented in a highly readable style.  The subjects may have a scientific or technical foundation, but the information offered isn't buried in arcane terminology.  For some of the articles, the style is designed to catch your attention over the destination of your tax dollars.  Is the response to the 11 September World Trade Centre attacks rational?  Is money being diverted to programs that might find better use and offer better security elsewhere?  Clark Chapman and Alan Harris address the first part of the question, while Steven Weinberg in one article and Charles Mann in another look at the second part.<br />With twenty-nine essays to consider, it quickly becomes clear what treasures of information this book contains.  Since it isn't indexed [which would likely double the size of both book and cost] browsing its pages is almost mandatory.  Alternatively, of course, you may simply start with Natalie Angier's paean to grandmothers and read until Edward O. Wilson's examination of the &quot;economic development for people&quot; versus &quot;protect the environment first&quot; debate.  No-one is better able to summarise the points and offer pointers to satisfy both.  Between those two fine writers, you will meet astronomers, cosmologists, biblical analysis and enjoy the interesting experience of seeing Oliver Sacks from within and without.  Outside those limits is a reminder that light from the Andromeda Galaxy we see tonight started its journey when hominid species were first walking upright.

Why are Maine ravens hesitant with a carcass while their western cousins gorge without fear beside wolves, coyotes or even eagles?  Do they actually warn humans about predators, or are they opportunists awaiting the kill they hope to share?  These mysterious birds, appearing in myths, legends, and, of course, Poe's lasting image, are Corvus corax - the Common Raven.  Heinrich, who has studied these enigmatic avians for many years, shares his thoughts, achievements, frustrations and observations in this compelling narrative.  In a series of invaluable accounts, crossing many countries and meeting many people, he shows us how much we have learned and need to study about these fascinating birds.  No matter how strange reported raven behaviour may sound, he reminds us, &quot;some raven, somewhere, actually did that&quot;.<br />Heinrich combines studies in the field with &quot;experiments&quot; performed in large aviaries.  Although an avid runner, he loathes climbing trees.  Of course, that's where ravens roost and nest.  He climbs.  He photographs.  He steals eggs [to record parental response before restoring the eggs to the nest].  All of which provide him with more information on how ravens live.  And think.  Universally acknowledged as the most intelligent birds, ravens have demonstrated to Heinrich how little we understand that cognitive ability.  This book's title is indicative of their behavioural variety.  Chapter titles, &quot;&quot;Social Webs&quot;, &quot;Vocal Communications&quot;, &quot;Prestige&quot;, &quot;Morality, Tolerance and cooperation&quot; and &quot;Play&quot; [yes, ravens play, apparently for their own entertainment] speak volumes about how much has been learned about these amazing creatures.  The text within them reveals we've only begun the quest for understanding.  Whatever else may be derived from this informative book, Heinrich's plea for more studies is earnest and compelling.  He is open with his admiration for the talents of his student assistants, but, clearly, there aren't enough of them.<br />Heinrich's study area reaches from Maine to anywhere.  If you've ever watched a raven tearing at a trash bin, you'll understand Heinrich's hesitation at visiting &quot;Jakob's&quot; home in Germany.  He was amazed to enter a neat, well-kept apartment instead of a scene of chaos.  Jakob was as fastidious as his doctor owner.  He even restricted his paper diet to junk mail.  Among the wealth of accounts in this book, the most intriguing remains the relationship of ravens and wolves.  It seems logical that ravens have learned to follow wolves.  Evolution has taught them the advantages of following an effective predator.  Heinrich, however, proposes this interaction works two ways with ravens guiding wolves to prey.  He suggests that early humans, still killing quietly, may have cooperated with ravens in a similar way.<br />Offsetting Heinrich's wealth of information is the style he uses to present it.  While no-one should object to his highly personalised account of his research and interests, some of the details might have been shaded or omitted.  It's fascinating to accompany his waiting for local ravens to descend on his prepared bait [a quarter of a dead calf or road kill groundhogs].  That the sequence began at 05:29 on the morning of 08 May is less compelling.  Especially when that type of detail is repeated frequently.  This lapse of interest-garnering is wholly overshadowed by the variety of experiences in many places Heinrich recounts.  Additionally, his photographs and drawings illuminate further what he relates in the text.  With an excellent bibliography to further anyone's reading, this is a treasure of a book.<br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]open with his admiration for the talents of his student assistants, but, clearly, there aren't enough of them. <br />Heinrich's study area reaches from Maine to anywhere.

A collection of over two dozen essays on the conduct of various animal [and one plant] species relate the findings of an Australian sabbatical.  Using his own and other's research he poses questions arising from a medley of animal antics.  How have these behaviours come about?  He shows how these queries have adaptive evolutionary roots.  The beauty of Darwin's idea, he reminds us, is that it provides us with &quot;an adaptationist foundation&quot; for testing hypotheses, arguments and ideas.  Adaptations are subtle, often requiring careful perception and analysis.  With careful study and cautious speculation he provides some stimulating ideas about the things he observed.<br />The examples are chiefly birds and insects.  The first is Kookaburra, the &quot;alarm clock&quot; of Australian mornings, is famous for its raucous wake-up call.  When other birds may sing, caw or carol throughout the day, why does Kooka limit himself [and it's the males doing the laughter] to this brief, but delightful, period?  Put simply, it's an energy saving device!  Once the territorial claim has been vocally established, he can go on to feeding or courting.  Other birds exhibit the immense variation evolution has produced.  The Mallee Fowl, a bush dweller may seem &quot;a dream come true&quot; for some.  This turkey-sized bird upsets gender patterns.  The male bird spends weeks building a five-metre wide nest, enticing a mate to join him, &quot;allowing&quot; her to deposit thirty eggs, then lets her wander off while he meticulously controls the nest environment ensuring a successful hatch.  Further north, Bowerbird building is also the male's role.  He constructs complex and gaudy structures, although not to the Mallee Fowl's immensity.  Here, however, the bower is merely the conjugal boudoir, with the impregnated female left to wander away for both nest building and chick rearing.<br />Wasps display contrasting practices.  With these insects, nest building is nearly uniformly a female task.  Males, however, make contributions to mating and reproduction in many other ways.  One wasp will bring nectar to a potential mate, then take her wingless body around from flower to flower as they seek a nest site.  Other males are even more energetic.  They will grab a moth or other large insect, then hang from a twig using the capture as bait.  Wasp nesting behaviours offer yet more varieties in practice.  One species employs a &quot;housemaid&quot; to guard and clean a ground nest.  Such maintenance allows the food-bearing mother to fly directly into the nest, thereby avoiding predators.<br />Alcock's easy style in this book keeps you at his side.  His text is enhanced by Marilyn Stewart's fine drawings.  Good maps provide location reference and ranges of the subjects.  His science is presented in a conversational, almost friendly manner.  He wants you to share his awe, his interest, and his conclusions.  We must be grateful to him for this, since we're all aware that others, who are as earnest and knowledgeable as he, don't manage to impart that with the same verve.  He also notes that his findings aren't confined to the wonders of the island continent.  The rules of life he outlines for us apply to the biosphere we inhabit.

Reading Straw Dogs is like being abruptly roused from a pleasant dream.  &quot;Wake and shake!&quot;, he cries.  Wake up to the falsity of the dogmas under which you live.  Shake them off and recognize that we live within reality's domain, not that of phantasms and fables.  These ideas disturb the comfortable, yet offer little comfort to those seeking an easy answer to life's challenges.  Gray understands our need for solace, but he knows reality isn't a tourist resort.  Nature is a harsh realm and he wishes us to confront enduring questions honestly.  Writing this book means he thinks we can do that.<br />Gray's thesis relies on aknowledging our place in the realm of nature.  We are, he reminds us, merely a part of the animal kingdom.  We are neither a special creation nor particularly unique.  Writing alone, with the continuity it provides, sets us apart while granting significant powers.  The &quot;continuity&quot; led to the notion of human &quot;progress&quot; and &quot;perfectability&quot;.  In an evolutionary sense both ideas are false, and we are evolution's product.  Even humanism, supposedly rational and secular, has fallen into the trap of seeking &quot;perfectability&quot;.  Gray finds this misleading and self-serving.  He examines the work of Western philosophers, the guides to our thinking, finding them mistaken or misleading.  In today's milieu, Lovelock's Gaia concept of the whole planet acting like a single organism, should be reconsidered.  Whether the details of this idea are valid is irrelevant.  It is the notion that we are apart from the remainder of nature that we must cast away.  The monotheist dogma granting us &quot;dominion over the earth&quot; is the most pernicious idea developed by humanity, Gray asserts.<br />Gray's text is fragmented without sacrificing continuity.  His techique allows pauses for reflection.  He posits ideas, questions, suggestions, assertions freely.  Stop and think about them as you read.  He tumbles many icons - he indicts Christianty on the second page, suggesting what will follow.  He is resolute and articulate about how important these questions are to us.  A superficial look at this work may lead the reader to feel hopeless.  If there was no hope, however, Gray wouldn't have bothered to write this book.  Like any thinker, he's concerned about the future.  The prospects appear bleak, but not insurmountable.  He assumes the reader is intelligent enough to consider and act on realistic solutions.  &quot;Perfectibility&quot; of humanity within nature may be impossible, but with an informed outlook &quot;accomodation&quot; can be achieved.  The first step, however, is the shedding of false dogmas.<br />Being informed isn't an easy task, Gray concedes.  He presents the thoughts of previous philosophers, but without direct attribution.  If you need references, his extensive bibliography is a fine starting point.  It's also a few years' study syllabus.  Taking his quotes at face value isn't the issue, however.  What must be confronted are the values that you, the reader, hold and cherish.  Can you &quot;live to see&quot;, or will you remain wrapped blindly within dogma?

Issues, from exploitation through gender politics to environmental ethics rise like vipers from the grass.  Do you deplore the &quot;Christmas rush&quot; as &quot;over-commercilized?  In this informative and entertaining account, Paquet skirts these dangers while keeping a wary, but knowing, eye on them.  Brimming with information and told with a verve rarely encountered, this book is a prize to read - and more than once.<br />Buying and selling, she reminds us, are as old as human existence.  The earliest farms meant surplus - &quot;extra grain could be traded for a neighbour's goat&quot;, says Paquet.  From these early exchanges, Paquet moves through market stalls and fairs, a commercial method lasting many centuries.  &quot;Shop&quot;, she explains, is a term going back to the 13th Century, but &quot;shopping&quot; had to wait until George III's era.  &quot;Shopper&quot; took another century to become current.  A reluctant shopper herself, Paquet leavens her &quot;social history&quot; with some lively personal experiences.  A &quot;Ladies Night In&quot; at Holt-Renfrew in downtown Ottawa proved a breath-taking experience.  The promotion line was perfume and sampling excesses drove her outside into the night air.  The free martinis might have helped force the exit.<br />Shopping is a two-sided affair.  Paquet cleverly portrays the problems of bringing seller and buyer together for a successful transaction.  Small towns had fairs and permanent shops for centuries in the Old World and the New.  Buyers rarely had far to go, but selection was limited.  Factory-made goods overturned long-established shopping patterns in many ways.  The goods were cheaper, meaning more people could buy them.  The buyers, earning money in factories, could purchase more than in previous times.  The choice of goods increased as competition led to variety.  The flood of new products drove the need for larger stores.  Complicating the situation was the rise of suburbs, separating buyers and sellers.<br />Paquet's description of these processes keeps your attention with her light, intimate style.  Her social history sense conveys us through the invention of the cash register, the escalator, the use of window displays and arranging products inside the store.  Her finest prose is expressed in the most revolutionary aspect of modern shopping.  Early department stores maintained extensive staffs for waiting on customers.  Clerks behind counters were supported by &quot;cash girls&quot; who took the order and your money, raced to a cashier's cage, often floors away, to record the purchase and obtain change.  Racing back to the customer, still idling at the counter, the transaction was finally completed.  &quot;I have a sneaking suspicion those girls were really fit!&quot;, she proposes.  All these fit children, some as young as twelve, were sacked  when a new form of store arose - the self serve.  &quot;The customer had to do the work!&quot;, Paquet exclaims, almost as surprised as the buyers must have been.<br />There are other forms of shopping than &quot;going to the store&quot;.  Paquet passes through the itinerant peddlers of the past to follow the Tupperware Parties and Avon Ladies of today.  Tupperware festivities occur somewhere on the globe every 2.2 seconds!  When the media wrote of &quot;legions&quot; of Avon Ladies, it was likely unaware that there have been 40 million of them since its 1886 founding.  Even while in decline in North America, Avon has become established in 137 countries.  In Brazil, &quot;there are more Avon sales reps than serving in the country's army and navy combined&quot;.  This global horde makes one billion transactions per year - one &quot;for every six human beings on the entire planet, including children and men&quot;.<br />We can all agree on the meaning of &quot;splurge&quot;, but no dictionary tells us how it originated.  So why do we do it?  Is our impulse to buy driven by hidden enticements devised by &quot;shopkeepers&quot; and their successors?  A quick glance at any modern grocery, she explains, shows how traffic is funneled into predictable paths.  Hairspray and other adult &quot;non-perishables&quot; are placed at your eye level.  Where do you find candy and the product's touted during Saturday morning's cartoon shows?  Have we no control?  Paquet's answer is &quot;Yes!&quot;.  While the lures to shop and overshop are strong, we need not submit to them.  The choice remains ours, she declares firmly.  While this is not a deep psychological study, there are practical problems that both buyers and sellers have, and continue to, address.  She offers many modern issues in a fine summary chapter on &quot;The Politics of Shopping&quot;.<br />Paquet's ten-page Bibliography is valuable support for the book.  Will you benefit from this book?  Undoubtedly, given the range of topics Paquet covers, there's certainly something in here for everyone.

No-one ever faulted Gould for the wide reach of his interests.  As with most of his previous collections of the columns he wrote for Natural History magazine, the spectrum covered here is spacious in both time and topic.  From syphilis to spandrels, he uses his writing talents to reveal, explain, bemuse and provoke the reader.  As the final collection of these commentaries, the title is appropriate in many ways.  Even here, Gould exhibits his adroit phrasing - some readers thought it was derived from the Apollo 1969 Lunar landing, not the record of an immigrant coming ashore at New York a century ago.  Gould touches on this &quot;landing&quot; so often that his reputed bridling at being edited shows as a misplaced conceit.<br />Readers may wander through this collection at random without loss.  With eight main divisions, selection should be easy.  The topics listed however, are anything but intuitive.  Instead, they represent his  - part of his - clever language manipulation.  Each reader must select preferences - each reviewer will disclose theirs here.  Whatever subject is addressed, you are guaranteed to be confronted with new ideas while enhancing your vocabulary.  Some of the new ideas may seem arcane, or obscure.  Ironies abound in this collection.  The essay on J.F Blumenbach, for example, one of the early classifiers of race, follows a twisted path.  You are told the origins of &quot;Causcasian&quot; to describe Europeans.  At the same time you are given a stern lecture on preconceived notions when reporting data.  By the end of the essay you aren't certain whether to admire Blumenbach or revile him.<br />Gould becomes caught up in many ironies of his own making.  While promoting his stance as a staunch defender of Darwin, here, as in other collections, he never fails to take a swipe at the naturalist.  Darwin is castigated for his racist views, his demeaning of women and his elitist social position.  Gould also, predictably, unleashes his well-worn lash to flail that equus mortus - &quot;reductionism&quot;.  Like the emperor's robe, a close look reveals its absence.  These are old themes to the regular Gould reader and we mustn't chasten too harshly.  There's comfort in the familiar.<br />The four concluding essays on the World Trade Centre assault reinforce the need for stronger editing.  While we in Canada are gratified that Gould found welcome refuge in Halifax, four repetitive essays only dull the impact of the event.  These, however, may prepare the reader for that you were advised to first skip - the Preface.  Someone who has worked diligently for so many years ceaselessly producing articles of consummate interest with originality and skill deserves a bit of boast.  Gould was anything but lazy.  Given the vast research and his sharing of interests with us, he deserves our applause.  Yet, the Preface to this book, even at the end of a notable career, is more than a little overbearing.  That's why it should be saved to last.  Readership of this book is split between the long-term Gould fans and newcomers just getting acquainted with this famous essayist.  The fan will know what to expect, but the beginner should proceed with caution.  Whether this book suits as a starting point for novice Gouldians is dubious at best.  Read earlier books and work up to this one.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada], predictably, unleashes his well-worn lash to flail that equus mortus - &quot;reductionism&quot;.

Darwin's great insight was the discovery that Nature isn't operating to a plan.  For over two millennia, Western European thinkers, whether secular or religious, had contended otherwise.  Nature, they claimed, whether divinely guided or not, exhibited the effect of instituted, unwavering patterns - the result of &quot;design&quot;.  Eyes, hands, the arrangement of flower petals were too complex to have occurred by chance, it was thought.  Christian monotheists enshrined this view within religious dogma.  Darwin's revolutionary Idea challenged that concept at its roots, thus toppling all established opinion.  The Idea, refuting theologians and philosophers alike, became Dangerous.  As Ruse points out, the traditional argument is still being used to contest Darwin's great insight into the driving force of life.<br />In this superbly conceived and crafted survey of the traditions and their overthrow, Ruse again proves his worth both as a scholar and a writer.  From Plato through Kant, from Descartes to Darwin, we are provided a tour of how humans have viewed Nature over many centuries.  The examples are endless - the eye, the hand, the awesome variety of flowering plants all seem to exhibit something behind their structure.  Ruse examines the result of &quot;new&quot; science challenging old dogmas during the Enlightenment.  He shows how the reconciliation of evidence with faith became known as &quot;natural theology&quot;.  In other words, nature's wonders were evidence of the god's plan.  Ruse follows the course of the reasoning of the adherents of &quot;nature by design&quot; up to the present.  The opening chapters of this book are presented so skillfully it seems he is endorsing the traditional view.  Nothing could be more mistaken.  In one stroke, Darwin overthrew those dogmas and Ruse can present Darwin's impact like few others.<br />Darwin demonstrated that what we see around us is a &quot;snapshot&quot; of natural history.  Our view sees the result of ages of natural selection.  Even with this great insight, Darwin lacked the information explaining the mechanics of natural selection.  How did &quot;modification with descent&quot; [Darwin's preferred usage] work down the generations.

They provide a window into the deep past and a hint of life's immense variety.  Richard Fortey, whose reputation is built on a long career studying trilobite fossils, provides a richly illustrated summary of the prizes of paleontology.  Carefully written to show the science behind fossil hunting, he avidly encourages amateurs with this book also.  He explains how fossils were the key element in establishing the science of geology by William Smith.  In later years they would be the buttress supporting Darwin's idea of evolution by natural selection.  In the 20th Century these silent witnesses would provide the finishing touches on the concept of plate tectonics.<br />Fortey has arranged this book well, with different animal and plant fossils and images carefully categorised, described and imaged.  He guides the novice through the process of recognizing and retrieving fossils from the various rock types.  Shales, as the product of shallow seas are likely rocks for many fossils allow easy retrieval.  However, Fortey notes the specimen will likely be shattered through geologic processes.  Limestone, on the other hand, hides its treasures well, but lucky finds may be dazzling in completeness or detail.  He explains the necessity of careful record location and condition of finds.  After all, careful records led to the understanding that western and eastern Newfoundland began their continental careers far apart.  Millions of years ago, eastern Newfoundland was far across the equator near the South Pole.  Fossil records traced its movement until it merged with the western side some time later.<br />Fortey's book is stunningly illustrated, well worth the price for that aspect alone.  Large, clear photographs, line drawings and maps support his animated writing style.  His enthusiasm for his science sparkles every page.  You become anxious to join his next expedition or set out on your own at the first opportunity.  His warnings about seaside drenchings, icy winds or smashed fingernails seem inconsequential compared to the possibility of obtaining one of nature's true treasures.  Gemstones seem dull and faded next to an object that once lived on a sea bottom or ancient prairie.  His final chapters on finding and preparing fossils are a welcome addition.  With the dual purpose of presenting beauty with education, this book is of value to anyone wishing to learn about the life of the past.<br />[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]unity.

921305:US	50941451	R3IQQGESPNPVBH	0738208442	645224254	The Essential Difference: The Truth About The Male And Female Brain	Books	5	144	160	N	N	Separate, but Equal	After a lengthy and unwarranted disclaimer that his work isn't \\"sexist\\" [whatever that is], Baron-Cohen surveys the foundations of male and female minds.  With a long clinical and teaching career, supported by an immense list of studies, he concludes that, in general, there are indeed \\"essential differences\\" in cognitive makeup between human genders.  While there is a spectrum of characteristics, certain general frameworks exist attributable to men and women.  For ease of analysis, he suggests that women are more empathic [\\"E\\" personalities] while men are more systematic [\\"S\\" personalities].  Each, he insists, has their role, with most people placed well within a median between extremes.  The trends, however, are clear.<br />In a chatty style he likely uses speaking with patients, Baron-Cohen shows that women's empathic tendencies give them the power to quickly assess others' emotional states.  Women more readily identify feelings in others, respond appropriately when sympathy is required and \\"reach out\\" in dealing with people.  He stresses that this \\"intuitive  sense\\" among women is almost universal and is rightfully well-regarded by all cultures.  Men, on the other hand, operate under the need to understand \\"systems\\", organized conditions, mechanics, technology and are thus driven to know \\"how things work\\".  This urge leads them away from the intimacy women have with others and, in the more extreme cases, are likely to become \\"loners\\".  The most outstanding examples are those suffering from autism which is overwhelmingly a male condition.<br />Baron-Cohen has spent years studying autism, offering a range of examples.  It may appear amusing that a five-year-old boy may be capable of memorizing dozens of car registrations and explain which car belongs to which house, but there are other factors to consider.  Such boys grow into men who cannot readily converse, directly or over the telephone.  They become the butt of teasing or hostility at their \\"withdrawn\\" state.  If lacking compensation in other areas, such as a vocation that allows them to apply a narrow focus to tasks, they risk ostracism from society.  Baron-Cohen offers an exceptional case of a mathematician whose genius brought him high awards, but who may fail to keep a lunch date due to some distraction.  These are real problems affecting real people.  Some of them may be your neighbours.  One of them might even, unknowingly, be you.<br />This book challenges much misled thinking that has permeated gender studies over the past generation.  Gender differences in outlook appear within a day of birth.  Newborns shown a photograph of a face, or an object composed of facial elements resulted in girls preferring the face while the boys tended to select the object.  This early division Baron-Cohen thinks may result from the testosterone surge baby boys undergo in the womb.  \\"Maleness\\" and brain development are interlocked and continue to manifest with development.  Baby girls, on the other hand, follow a different, parallel path.  They appear to respond to distress in other people more readily than do boys.  They will make eye contact with others more readily.  The pattern continues through life, although at differing levels with individuals.  Baron-Cohen stresses these differences don't represent \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\" values.  Human males and females are overall equally intelligent.  That intelligence is expressed in different ways.  More to the point, men and women have both E and S traits, individually manifest over a wide spectrum.  Extremes are few, but he notes extreme Es are more socially comfortable and acceptable than the autistic extreme S personalities.<br />Baron-Cohen doesn't limit himself to the results of clinical studies and calling for more research.  He is keen to have readers begin to rethink how society should deal with those suffering from autism [Asperger's Syndrome].  He calls for a greater tolerance for \\"coldness\\" or \\"lack of sympathy\\".  Self assessmentis a good place to start building that tolerance.

Williams' entry in the growing stack of these works has the advantage of tight focus.  He limits his survey to the 18th Century - Enlightenment Europe.  He illuminates a time when the Royal Navy hadn't yet gained control of the seas.  The vivid accounts of 19th Century Empire building have obscured the hesitant beginnings of earlier eras.  The 18th Century explorers were hesitant pioneers, largely unknown today.  Williams conveys their voyages with the domestic political dramas as background. With accomplished style, this book traces the debates as it follows the early explorations into Hudson's Bay and the North Pacific.<br />Three figures take central stage in this narrative.  The first is Arthur Dobbs who set the tone and topics in support of the search.  Dobbs, an MP from Ireland, saw the promise of increased trade, finding mineral riches and nationalist expansion through finding the Passage.  A major aspect was his goal to demolish the monopolistic grip of the Hudson's Bay Company on trade and exploration in the North American Arctic.  In Williams' account, Dobbs maintained his campaign over many years, as an open advocate and anonymously.  Dobbs was instrumental in helping turn over exploration from private hands and put it under the aegis of the Royal Navy.  Dobbs was convinced [or convinced himself] that fur trading profits would be purely secondary to the potential mineral wealth to be found in the Arctic.<br />Over the years, Williams recounts, fluctuating relationships with other European powers prodded Dobbs into more purely nationalistic reasons for pursuing the Passage.  With Spain well established in the New World, but hesitant in exploring unknown lands, France and Russia became new threats.  As Dobbs faded from his active role, his themes were furthered by Alexander Dalrymple and Joseph Banks.  Banks, who journeyed with Cook to the Australian coast, urged a strong British presence in the Pacific.  As a result, an opening to the Passage from the west became the new quest at the end of the 18th Century.  Williams surveys the Spanish and Russian incursions well, but skims over the enigmatic La Perouse, whose career was more South Pacific than North.  All the North Pacific voyages, he demonstrates, were guided by the almost mythical accounts of de Fuca and de Fonte of nearly a century before.<br />Williams has little good to say about the persona crossing his view. Dobbs is portrayed as a manipulator of skilled abilities.  Driven by his desire to crush the HBC's monopoly and expose its secrets, he even organizes and funds an exploration of this own.  Other promoters are too easily deluded and captains are fractious or incompetent.  Even the mighty Cook, far out in the Pacific, shouldn't have been there on his fatal last voyage - he'd become unwell and irascible, a danger to the success of the expedition.  Only the Italian Malaspina and George Vancouver are lauded for accuracy and honesty.  Not all of his judgments are well-considered.  He gives Robert McClure credit for finally revealing the passage, when it was overlander John Rae who reached the Passage while seeking the Franklin crew.<br />Williams has given his account an extra bonus by inserting some fascinating illustrations.  Not only are modern maps there for reference, but he's included replicas of 18th maps by various cartographers.  Some of these are even based on maps drawn or described by Native American peoples.  His sources are many and varied, providing a guide to others wishing to delve into the era.  A good writing style makes this book a worthwhile purchase.

The genre often endures bad press in mainstream media for various reasons -  &quot;thin&quot; plots, &quot;shallow&quot; characters, even the romance element is labelled &quot;stilted&quot;.  These or other faults are paraded by elitist critics.  Rarely encountered, humour has the capacity to sweep away many blemishes, real or perceived.  Romance novels almost universally conclude with happy endings.  Getting to that point, however, often means slogging through a miasma of dreary events, sombre people or dire prospects.  Even worse is the imposition of some deep philosophical issue the reader must unravel.<br />Nonnie St George has broken with some of this tradition with her first book, The Ideal Bride.  Setting the scene in Regency London gives her room to apply solid research into people, events and language.  St George handles these elements well in both plot and characterisation.  England is enjoying burgeoning prosperity.  The Continental Wars against Napoleon are over, but issues remain - the widows of casualties for one.  Who cares about them?  Why would they be important in a story of romance?<br />Gabriel Carr aims to be married.  He's a successful property owner and investor.  As a man of business, planning is essential in his quest.  He's drawn up a list of what constitutes the perfect wife.  His mother, disdainful of such a &quot;practical&quot; approach, chides him mercilessly.  There's a compulsion underlying his wife-hunting method, of course.  He must marry before he's thirty or lose an inheritance.  He's dogged, determined, independent.  The combination inevitably results in a certain hubris.  According to classic pattern, such arrogance, even in a mild-mannered man, must lead to an undoing.<br />Boy meets girl, naturally.  Rather, man meets woman, since both protagonists are adults.  The woman is of the aristocracy - what the British refer to as the ton.  In this era, upcoming businessmen are suspicious of the ton.  They are often dissolute, and in many cases, they need money.  Nola Grenvale seems little different.  But &quot;Saint Nola&quot; is different, in an even worse way.  Promoting the cause of the Napoleonic War widows, she's set on helping them obtain independent income.  She needs a location for the widows to market their wares. Charity and business are rarely close acquaintances, let alone nuptial partners.  Nor is marriage a major concern for Nola.  Her aim is an intrusion on Gabriel's life and he's prompt in showing his resentment.  Nola isn't a candidate for marriage, anyway.  Along with her other priorities, Nola isn't in the running in her own mind.  Nola's tall, a redhead in a blonde and brunette world and is spare in the bosom - &quot;she looked exactly like a Pall Mall gas lamppost&quot;.<br />They are a difficult pair to reconcile.  Nola is nobody's fool.  She's outspoken, assertive, and determined to fulfill her own ambitions.  More provision for hubris.  Mixing two such recipes results only in a spicy stew.  St George builds her story solidly through the characters.  Alone or interacting, Gabriel and Nola are introduced to us, reflect on their respective values, and leave us smiling over the complexities of life.  While St George doesn't distract us with deep issues, the value of self-assessment is clear.  She helps us in this endeavour by writing with keen humour.  Her fine sense of light irony keeps this story alive and moving.  Neither plot nor characters are forced or contrived.  She avoids the often stilted language used to &quot;type&quot; historical fiction.  It's not great literature, but it's great cottage fare.ous of the ton.

Tiffany Aching, wise beyond her nine years, sets out to find her missing brother, Wentworth.  Like all older siblings, she feels displaced by the younger boy.  She feels resentment for his presence, his demands, his constantly runny nose.  She's already defended Wentworth against a mysterious attacker who rose from the local river to snatch him away.  Still, he mysteriously disappears and Tiffany sets off on a self-assigned quest to bring him home.  He is, for all his faults, hers.<br />A nine-year-old girl on a quest is vulnerable.  Tiffany, however, doesn't lack allies and support.  The first is inexplicable, the second is indefinable.  Her allies are a horde of small, blue-tattooed warriors - the Pictsies, the Nac Mac Feegle.  Their traditions run to brawling, sheep-stealing and taking a \\"wee nip\\" when opportunity presents itself.  They're expressive - in Pratchett's hands that means hilarious bits of dialogue, reasoning, philosophy and common sense.  Above all, is their insistence on freedom.  They've known a monarch, and they detest her.  They also fear the power of the written word and lawyers.  They're not alone in that.<br />Tiffany's support is in the memory of her gran.  Granny Aching lived alone on the Chalk.  She was quiet, but powerful.  As a shepherdess, she knew the ways of sheep and nature.  She confronted powerful people, achieving success with minimal effort.  No curse can match the potency of a quietly spoken expression: \\"There'll be a reckoning\\".  Granny's at the edge of much of Tiffany's thinking.  She instills in Tiffany a sense of value: \\"Speak out for those with no voice\\".  Is her memory enough to give Tiffany strength against the Pictsies' arch enemy, the \\"Quin\\"?<br />As usual, Pratchett delivers more than he promises.  This is sold as a \\"children's book\\", but memories of The Who's great song will be running through adults' heads as they read the Nac Mac Feegle's fervent chant.  Like any Pratchett book, The Wee, Free Men contains many strata of ideas beckoning your further inquiry.  The first time you read this book, it will be for the adventure, the novelty and the fun.  The second time will be to delve more deeply into Pictsish.  See how deftly Pratchett confronts us with \\"real world\\" issues seeking resolution.  Pratchett is almost unique in his incorporating science in his stories, and is unmatched in this ability.  His depiction of the origins of chalk is a wondrous read.  Not  limited to physical science, he cogently probes human questions.  Buy this for your children, but when they've put it aside for the first time [and they will return to it later], steal away with it to a quiet corner.  You'll discover both a place to escape and a rigorous reality confronting you.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]ata of ideas beckoning your further inquiry.

Whether describing the cliffs of Cornwall or his journeys in search of fossils, he keeps your attention in thrall.  He is even able to lead us into the realm of arcane terminology.  In an early section in this book we are carefully introduced to the physical structure of long-extinct creatures.  With graceful descriptions, he demonstrates how to painlessly add eight new words to our personal lexicons.  He has much to tell us and he relates his story and his science with evocative skill.  The exclamation mark of  the title certainly reflects his enthusiasm for the topic.  With his ability to communicate that zeal, it becomes infectious.<br />Trilobites, he continually reminds us, lasted far longer than the dinosaurs - nearly 300 million years, compared to the saurians' 120 million.  Their persistence, Fortey explains, is due to their adaptability.  They were so efficient at finding and filling ecological niches they are sometimes referred to as &quot;the beetles of the Paleozoic&quot;.  Fortey shows how various species inhabited deep oceans, shallow seas or glided through the mid-depths of the seas.  The only niche left uninvaded, Fortey ponders ruefully, was fresh water streams and lakes.  Had they done so, he muses, they might have persisted to modern times.  Whether that step might have precluded our evolution, Fortey sets aside for others to consider.<br />We learn the anatomy of these lost arthropods, how the structure of the legs was discovered, how they grow from minuscule diatomic forms to more than lobster-sized.  The most engaging aspect of trilobites was the variety and form of the eyes.  Unlike the squishy, liquid-filled sensitive orbs we carry, trilobites &quot;learned&quot; enough chemistry to form eyes of calcite crystals.  These are arranged in a wide variety of patterns and structures, reflecting the animals' diversity.  Some lacked them altogether, having never developed vision, or losing it as successive generations migrated to the stygian depths.<br />Fortey has traveled the globe in search of these mysterious creatures.  From misty Newfoundland through snake infested Queensland to an Arabian site infested with scorpions.  He insists the risks are ignored when a new fossil emerges from the rocks.  You feel that every new find should have a champagne celebration to accompany it.  Fortey, however, is content with beer - sometimes just a bit of cool water suffices.  Every page of this book dispels the mistaken image of the unfeeling, austere, white-coated academic.  His contribution to the science is inestimable - he's named 150 species.  Yet those accomplishments pale against his love for the science and the creatures he studies.<br />In explaining the diversity of his treasured trilobites, Fortey takes us through the mechanics of plate tectonics.  Geology is the science that birthed paleontology, and the two sciences have been intimately entwined for generations.  In explaining why different types of trilobites evolved, Fortey traces the movements of continents over the millennia.  East Coast Newfoundlanders may be pleased to read how their part of the island was once joined to the European continent to later merge with the western segment.  The key to discovering this phenomenon was, of course, trilobite species differences.  This kind of information Fortey offers within a framework of why these lost life forms are important for an understanding of who we are in nature.  A fine addition to any bookshelf.

They tramp dusty trails, peer into bushes and caves, suffer equatorial sun and strange animals almost without a murmur of complaint.  A few, like Paul Quarrington are seeking some answers.  Sometimes it's The Answer that's sought.  These pilgrims are trailing the man who conceived the best idea anyone, any time, ever had.  They retrace the footsteps of Charles Robert Darwin, who visited the Galapagos Islands, then returned home to think about what he'd seen.  What Darwin saw and thought led to the first understanding of how life, the universe and everything, actually works.<br />Quarrington visited the Islands with his daughter Carson, seven years old, and his father, &quot;ten times that age&quot;.  Quarrington, in an illustrious account, sought what Darwin found - a Great Insight.  In keeping with that quest, his narrative is highly personalized and introspective.  That is, after all, what &quot;insight&quot; is - looking inward.  He recounts his boyhood adoption of divine Special Creation of the universe.  Over the years, however, he came to understand how unsatisfying divine creation is in explaining life.  As with those thousands of others, he came to see a pilgrimage to the islands as a likely source of enlightenment.<br />He admits the symbolism of visiting the Galapagos with three generations.  The account explains his travails as both a son and a parent.  Where does &quot;natural selection&quot; fit in his dealings with his father and his daughter?  He examines his own life, what he knows of his father's and how confesses to how adroitly Carson manipulates him.  Through it all, Quarrington gives snippets of Darwin's life and thinking, that of natural selection's critics and how many questions have been pondered and answered.  In order to accomplish this, he relies on a bevy of writers listed in a five-page bibliography.  That's an enterprising effort for a writer listed as a &quot;humourist&quot;.  Yet, the humour, rich with ironies, is in full flower in this lucid account.  Between the science, the charming [and sometimes not so charming] wit, he has provided a singularly readable account of one man's wrestling with the attempt to find something divine, where divinity has no place.  It's a book reflecting what many have experienced, although likely with less success.<br />In the end, Quarrington does achieve an insight.  Perhaps even an Insight.  While it's doubtlessly his own, unique in a way that may keep only its conceiver satisfied.  Still, he accomplishes it after strenuous effort.  He achieves it very early one morning in his kitchen, sipping a single malt and expressing contentment at what he has wrought.  That's not a bad environment for gaining Insight.  If he attains well-being from what he's wrought, who are we to dismiss it?  He's made the effort, laid out his own path, and, like those pilgrims following Darwin's trail, perhaps we can follow Quarrington's example.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]	2003-10-16

Garbo Laughs is an entertaining and impressive account of a &quot;nuclear family&quot; whose members range from obsessive to indifferent to the enticements of movies.  Harriet Browning, a writer, is driven by actors, actresses, directors involved in film.

Yet that very circumstance is a tribute to Elizabeth Hay's eloquent portrayal of two sisters in drought-ridden central Canada. Her people are deep and complex, intensely drawn and immensely real. Even the peripheral characters ring true, without the blemish of contrivance. Hay's descriptive ability in both urban and rural settings gives this book further enhancement. She vividly depicts the impact of environment on her chief protagonist, providing a framework for change of mood throughout the narrative. Hay, too, is clearly a student of weather. And a keen observer of people.<br />Norma Joyce Hardy initiates a life-long adoration of Maurice Dove with a touch on his cheek. That she's but a child is of little moment. That she's overshadowed by her sister's beauty becomes even less so. Even at nine years of age, she's driven by determination to find the means to supplant Lucinda. Resentful of her sister's looks, industry, and favoured place with their father, she becomes secretive, duplicitous, devious. Lucinda, having replaced their dead mother, is vulnerable, and Norma Joyce takes advantage of that exposure. Maurice becomes the tool for expressing Norma's envy, but she becomes the victim of her own machinations. Maurice, unsurprisingly, is following his own agenda, and Norma's place in it is problematic.<br />In pursuit of Maurice, Norma Joyce's life orbits like an erratic comet. From the most rural to the most urban environments in North America and back again, her loci remain vague. Only Maurice is a fixed point, but that seeming stability actually is the cause of her displacements. She is torn between seeking and avoiding him, particularly when the attainment of her goal leads to the inevitable result. Hay brings the Hardy family out of dry Saskatchewan to &quot;golden&quot; Ontario. Ottawa, however pleasant and green, fails to bring rest, and Norma pursues Maurice to New York City. A greater contrast to Prairie Canada can hardly be imagined, but Hay guides us through Norma's transition flawlessly. New York, however, doesn't resolve her situation with Maurice, which grows ever more complicated. Nor is the relationship of the sisters granted an easy path. Who carries the burden of Lucinda's fate will be the topic of endless debate.<br />Hay's account is admirable in its prowess in compelling attention to people and places. The factual nature of her characters, their failure to fulfill simple expectations is a credit to her skills. A love story of sorts, this is hardly a &quot;romantic novel.&quot; It is a richly rewarding story, worthy of your attention. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]o New York City.

Intense competition for bulbs led to bankruptcies resulting from wild speculations, families were disrupted, and fortunes were won and lost.  While &quot;tulipmania&quot; subsided, a new mania has arisen.  More sedate yet more widespread, orchid collecting is a multimillion dollar business.  Orlean portrays the passions involved in orchid collection and breeding in this fascinating work.  Unlike tulips, which are limited in species, orchids encompass thousands, with the number of natural species likely doubled by breeder hybridization.  Orlean's account depicts the history and business of orchid collecting, identifying and commercialisation.  Orchidmania today is only slightly less intense than that of the 17th Century Dutch Republic.  Orlean shows that collectors and breeders are highly competitive, aggressive, personalities, ready to engage in whatever is deemed necessary to achieve their goals.<br />Orlean's fascination with orchids began with the arrest and trial of John Laroche, collector, blackmarketeer and general eccentric.  Laroche becomes her pivot point for relating the history of orchid growing and collecting in Florida.  She takes us along on her visits to breeders and collectors.  She pursues them into Florida swamps and to orchid shows.  Everywhere she explores and everyone she meets evokes the same feelings - vigorous competition, unbridled ambition, deep suspicion and a continual skirting with the law.  Through all her encounters, Laroche hovers like a malign spirit, sometimes guiding her, sometimes taunting her.  She seems captivated by him, his eccentricities simultaneously attracting and repelling her.<br />This highly personalised account is a compelling read, with Orlean's feelings candidly expressed.  The persistence of Laroche becomes, finally, almost tedious.  The fascinating history of the orchid industry and the other figures she encounters might easily have displaced him as the central character.  His erratic life, with swift changes from one interest to another, might interest a psychologist.  Here, LaRoche almost becomes a non sequitor.  He might have been dispensed with in a chapter.  Orlean, almost unwillingly, remains bound to follow his fate, to whatever end.  Her attentions meet indifferent response.  They're nearly unrequited.  Still, he manages to lead her through the swamps in her new-found quest to locate a particular orchid in the wild.  It's not a pleasant journey, but one which she recounts in vivid prose.<br />Some readers will know this book was the subject of the film, &quot;Adaptation&quot;.  The film is the story of the story and, in many respects, is a better portrayal than Orlean achieves.  There is far too much well-presented information here lacking in the film.

MR achieves a new degree of intensity in examining the human tendency for conflict.  The &quot;fantasy&quot; aspects of the Discworld are nearly abandoned in this story of war and soldier life.  To be sure, there's a vampire, a troll, and Angua the werewolf.  An Igor completes the team in a special, rather cutting, role.  None of these &quot;fantasy&quot; characters can avoid being dominated by their human aspects.  Pratchett enhances his ability to show us to ourselves.  While his humour carries us along in following the tale, the underlying theme remains clear.  War is a distinctly human enterprise.<br />Polly Perks seeks her missing brother in the middle of a conflict none can explain nor justify.  Hiding the fact that she's a girl, she slashes her golden curls, dons boys' clothes [including &quot;special purpose&quot; socks] and enlists to seek him out.  Her military career is fraught with risk, but not just from battle.  If she's exposed, the wrath of Nuggan, the local deity, will be boundless - dressing as a man is an Abomination.  As are cats, the colour blue, garlic and a host of social ills. These are lined out in the Appendix of a bible - with the Appendix larger than the main inspirational text.<br />In Sam Vimes' view, Polly has entered a life of crime, but not through her cross-dressing.  He thinks &quot;war is a crime - like murder&quot;.  Sam, Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, has been sent to make a peace.  When the stakes are as high as these - who rules the country -  the task becomes Herculean.  As with most wars, this one uses high moral purpose to camouflage baser selfish motives.  A prince seeks power.  Polly, along with her meagre &quot;regiment&quot; is caught up in the forces this war for rule has unleashed.  They are ill-equipped and untrained for their task.  Even so, Polly's first skirmish with the enemy has enduring results.<br />Pratchett, using Polly's voice, has produced his finest work.  He delves into military life, the vagaries of monarchy, and the shams of religion.  He exposes many nerves in this book, but with a gentle finesse.  He encourages the open mind while appealing to those who haven't taken the trouble to even ask questions.  Polly asks and confronts many of these queries.  She examines the answers in light of what is occurring around her.  She's sharp and alert.  She has to be, hiding her identity from friend and foe alike.  She learns to belch, pick her nose and walk swaying her shoulders instead of her hips.  Is this what's important?  Pratchett takes us to the abyss of gender politics, reveals its deceptive simplicity, and leads us away.  To confront a yet more fundamental horror.  He is adept at surprising readers,  achieved  here with his usual aplomb.  Once again, he's &quot;mirrored&quot; our world.  Take a look and see if you are imaged here.

Light, he argues, is the most prevailing environmental element.  Crossing biology, geology, ecology and physics with a bridge of optics, he shows how many body structures have varied due to light's availability and intensity.  Most important to the reader, is his contention that when life developed a greater sensitivity to light, evolution was given a significant boost.  We call the time of that &quot;boost&quot; the Cambrian Explosion.  According to Parker, the mechanism driving the boost was the evolution of the eye.  The wide diversity exhibited by evolution's abrupt advances around 550 million years ago produced creatures whose descendants are cats, bears, birds, and you.  Parker provides a wealth of background material in developing his thesis.  The forces of plate tectonics, the way light is absorbed, reflected, bent, and even biologically generated are all presented.  He shows the relevance of each aspect in a slowly and carefully built concept.<br />Parker presents his theme with verve.  &quot;Let there be images!&quot; is a concluding example.  New ideas in science tend to use a forceful approach.  Since he's laid a firm Darwinian foundation for this exclamation, perhaps his enthusiasm is warranted.  He explains much about early life, the nature of light and how animals have adapted body plans to use light effectively.  Parker shows how new research tools can analyse fossils to reveal the past wasn't the soft, dull, colourless world often portrayed.  Some of the tricks developed by Nature millions of years ago weren't duplicated by human technology until very recently.  Light, he explains, was both an attractant and a repellent in the shallow seas of early oceans.<br />The mortar binding the facets of Parker's idea is predation.  Both eaters and eaten needed to detect each other to survive.  In parallel with the eye, bodies changed to avoid detection and deflect biting mouths.  Survival in evolutionary terms, he reminds us, means more than eating or avoiding being a meal.  Vision enhanced the process of sexual selection, with the new body forms exhibiting colours to attract mates.  These and other factors combine to provide what Parker calls his &quot;Light Switch&quot; view of the Cambrian period.  As a foundation for his hypothesis, Parker joins the ranks of Eldredge and Gould's &quot;punk-eek&quot; [punctuated equilibrium] cabal of evolutionary biologists.  This step is taken to grant eye evolution a rapid pace in line with the many changes the Cambrian Explosion seems to evidence.  That's unfortunate, since it isn't necessary and he refutes the idea many times in citing his own evidence.  A species span of<br />120 million years without a bump is equilibrium indeed!<br />Parker's ebullient prose is supplemented by excellent line drawings and photographs.  These provide both background and examples of his points.  His style, while ardent, is a bit rambling, although this can be forgiven in a book covering so many aspects of evolution's path.  What cannot be forgiven is the lack of any bibliography or notes.  This lack is outrageous and  insults the reader.  Although many researchers are presented, few titles grace the pages, leaving the reader with the task of seeking further information or confirmation almost from scratch.  The publisher has no excuse for allowing this lack.

Sulloway pulls together a mass of research, including his own to find patterns deriving from family structure.  Using a strong evolutionary stance, he shows how &quot;sibling rivalry&quot; for resources extends into later life.  This sweeping study keeps the reader's attention with clear, straightforward prose and a refreshingly direct approach.  It will keep other students of human behaviour working for many years.<br />The general pattern, examined within larger social, political, religious and scientific arenas, shows how later-borns become the flexible, innovative thinkers.  While, necessarily, only a few become actual creators of new ideas, they more readily accept fresh concepts.  Later-borns learn to adapt in the family environment - it's a survival trait.  First-borns, and Sulloway notes the difference between chronological and &quot;functional&quot; first-borns, cling to a conservative stance.  Even if the parents are radical thinkers, their first-borns will adhere to their way of thinking.  Later-borns in such a circumstance are more likely to depart from the family's stance, adhering to more conservative social or political ideas.  The disparity in attitudes is the norm within the family, not necessarily across family boundaries.<br />Throughout the book, Sulloway frequently turns to Darwin as a case study in strengthening his thesis.  It's a wise choice, since Darwin is emblematic of what Sulloway asserts.  middle-class, middle sibling, middle-aged at the peak of his achievements, Darwin exemplifies most of Sulloway's criteria for distinguishing birth order as a personality driver.  Sulloway concedes that the focus on Darwin is a logical result of the naturalist's showing the world how evolution works.  The traits he describes have biological roots, intensified by the human condition.  Human families have a long time to build the patterns he describes.  Since Sulloway's thesis shows that cultural and socio-economic factors have little or no bearing on the evolutionary patterns established, previous dogmas will have to be revised or discarded.  In more than one sense he's duplicating Darwin's own experience.<br />The book concludes with a series of Appendices explaining how Sulloway built his database of events and people.  He uses 121 historical &quot;revolutions&quot; and nearly two dozen scientific ones, as well as the Reformation to support his thesis.  The criteria for selection are given and explained.  He's not averse to challenges by other scholars, but they'd best have their data firmly in hand.  He's buttressed his case admirably.  Only one serious challenge to Sulloway's effort has emerged since this book was published.  Readers should be aware of Judith Rich Harris' critique of Sulloway's methods in the Appendix of her The Nurture Assumption.

This is not the place to examine the debate, but both should be reviewed by readers. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]	2003-10-06

This account of personal awe in the face of Nature is a passionate example.  From the centre of Christian America, Goodenough explains why ideas of divine forces driving Nature must be replaced.  Her replacement, trying to mediate between \\"cold\\" science and misleading traditional dogma, is called \\"natural religion\\".  Astonished by the wonders of cosmology and life, Goodenough became a scientist and shed her monotheistic background.  What wasn't thrown out with the theology was her sense of wonder.  Having once buried her head beneath a pillow out of despair over her inability to comprehend the cosmos, she relates how she emerged to study science.  She chose biology, and it's well for us she did.  Her description of protein construction is unmatched in science writing.<br /><br />In this work, she opens at the beginning, explaining how physics underlies everything, including life.  She relates how \\"life from non-life\\" can and does occur.  She moves to a description of the origins and later development of life's processes.  Cell mechanisms are portrayed.  In this topic, she creates a wonderful idea - the Mozart Metaphor.  We listen to a Mozart sonata with a sense of awe and veneration.  Those feelings, she urges, aren't diminished by the knowledge that the music is reducible to blobs of ink on a page.  Any musician can read those dots and restore the wonder by playing the music.  In life, our knowledge of life's processes doesn't diminish the marvel of them.  Goodenough translates that feeling into a \\"Mystery\\" which she wishes to share.  If you need to understand how much of life functions, but fear abandoning \\"traditional\\" beliefs, this book is a fine first step.<br /><br />A second step is one Goodenough regrettably omits.  While her \\"natural religion\\" comes accompanied by a wealth of poetic, Biblical and other religious messages, the voice of science itself is silent in this book.  Charles Darwin's own \\"grandeur of this view of life\\" is a serious omission in a book so descriptive of evolution.  While some would resist pairing Darwin with Mozart, the evolutionist's reach extends beyond our tiny world.  The same is unlikely to be the case for the composer.  It's not enough to turn what science has shown us about life into a new \\"faith\\".  Practitioners of science deserve hearing, especially when an author is speaking in their name.  The information she uses has taken many years, much hard work and no little inspiration.  Goodenough might have given that foundation a bit more ink. Some fine chapter illustrations grace the text, but the bibliography is limited.

Such an approach misleads the reader and misrepresents the subject.  No amount of footnoting and references can redeem a book that applies this century's &quot;political correctness&quot; to attitudes of three hundred years ago.  This work is a classic case of the faults of an &quot;a priori&quot; approach to history and philosophy.  Gullan-Whur is self-deluded, confused both about Spinoza's life and his thinking, and sadly lacking in historical sense.  Gullan-Whur's book makes meagre contribution to the recent studies of Spinoza's life and philosophy.<br />The chronological narrative would be a redeeming feature of this book, except that Spinoza's wanderings defy detailed analysis.  This isn't Gullan-Whur's fault, but her struggles to locate him physically are on a par with her comprehension of his philosophy.  Spinoza, in line with many thinkers of his day, adopted various nom de plumes in his dealings with others.  A Jew of Portuguese ancestry living in the Dutch Republic made communication difficult.  Gullan-Whur traces his attempts to learn Dutch, Latin, and even a smattering of English.  Latin, however, remained the international language.  This situation meant that in a given day several languages might be needed according to circumstances.  Gullan-Whur blithely ignores this aspect of language and applies one of his various identities according to when and where she's describing his activities.  Her variations in Spinoza's names are compounded by her exasperating habit of referring to many of his contemporaries by their given names.<br />Within a dozen pages, Gullan-Whur launches into a diatribe on the condition of women in the 17th Century Dutch Republic.  A short comment would be understandable, but she returns to this theme throughout the book.  At one point she accuses Spinoza of being both &quot;arrogant&quot; and &quot;misogynist&quot;.  As a final thrust, she entertains the notion that Spinoza's solitary life indicates a propensity to homosexuality.  As final point, she abhors his affection for pipe smoking.<br />Gullan-Whur's attempt to deal with Spinoza's philosophy is little short of catastrophic.  She trolls his writings to substantiate her pre-conceived notions.  Using the material like a condiment, she sprinkles quotations from his writings throughout the text.  These must be constantly referenced in the Notes to determine the source.  The validity of the statements she attributes to him must be assumed.  In most cases she imputes the citation to some early period in his life, implying that all his ideas were fixed at an early age.  Development of ideas is apparently alien to her.  The result is a goulash which the reader must reverse-engineer to derive some logical progression of thought.  Given the breadth of Spinoza's ideas, her  approach invalidates much of his thinking.  This book has no place in early Enlightenment studies. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]ust, she entertains the notion that Spinoza's solitary life indicates a propensity to homosexuality.

The encounter, reported by North America's foremost nature journalist, is an informative, exquisite read.  Quammen's value in explaining Nature's realm is demonstrated by his many excellent works.  This one achieves a new level of excellence as he travels the planet seeking that which we fear most - predators.  Not just any predators, but what he terms the &quot;alpha predators&quot; - large, solitary and figures of fearful legend.  Legends play a large role in how we view the rest of Nature.  No matter how strenuously we try to separate ourselves from our environment, Quammen argues, it will return to confront us.<br />Quammen focuses on four predators in this account - the Asian lion, the crocodile, bears in Romania and &quot;Siberian&quot; tigers.  Surrounded by humans and their legends and lifestyles, this quartette symbolises our conflicting views of animals with reputations as &quot;man-eaters&quot;.  Disdaining accusations of &quot;sexist&quot; or other cultural labels surrounding his terms, Quamman confronts us with the realities of human-predator interactions.  Lions, which once roamed from Atlantic Europe to Eastern Asia, have been pushed into meagre enclaves outside of Africa.  They, along with the crocodiles, bears and Amur tigers are surrounded by human neighbours.  Quammen explains that the long-term human residents, the Mahldari in India, Aborigines of Australia, the Romanian shepherds and Ugede of Eastern Russia have formed accomodating<br />relationships with their proximate predator populations.  The oft-repeated phrase is &quot;don't bother them and they won't bother you&quot;.<br />Changes in political and economic forces, Quammen contends, bring changes to those relationships.  While national governments may strive to protect these select species, local conditions are being overturned.  Globalisation intrudes on local economic and political structures, changing market demands, resource allocation and use, and the lifestyles of both predators and their prey.  Populations shift in response, habitats are invaded or destroyed and abrupt changes confront traditional lifestyles.  These are adjustments forced within a lifetime, not over generations.  Quammen shows how we must learn quickly and immediately before the damage from the changes are irreparable.<br />What role does a predator play in the natural order of life?  Shouldn't we simply eliminate these &quot;dangerous&quot; lifeforms?  Quammen's primary example seems wholly out of place at first glance.  One researcher removed a predatory starfish from a section of beach near Seattle.  The result, in a very short time, was a substantial shift in other species balance in the area.  Quammen's own contacts among the topical predators' human neighbours echo the sentiment - remove the animals and the habitat follows.  The impact is uncalcuable.  The lesson is glaringly clear  - we need these &quot;ferocious&quot; creatures to maintain the environment we inhabit.<br />Quammen departs from mainstream conservatism in this excellent study.  The role of humanity may not be cast aside and species isolated for protection.  He urges a role for hunting, for skins, for culling where needed.  These activities, distasteful to some, can be  beneficial when applied with informed controls.  There are no simple answers to maintaining diversity.  We must all be aware of the issues involved, and this book is a fine place to begin learning.

Nadler's account of Baruch Spinoza will stand for some time as the best introduction of a man of his own times and far beyond.  Spinoza's philosophy has been sadly overlooked by scholars.  Nadler's diminutive title is almost an injustice to the scope of his efforts.  Yet, it perfectly summarises what Nadler does - recounts a life without overwhelming us with lengthy analysis or idle speculation.  He places Spinoza firmly in the social, political and philosophical realms marking the Enlightenment's beginnings.  With clear presentation skills, Nadler takes us through the life and times of a man whose thinking was far in advance of his contemporaries.  That Spinoza was reviled and condemned by church and state, yet avoided the martyrdom typical of Bruno, Galileo and others, attests to his perception and behavioural qualities.<br />Spinoza was the descendent of one of the multitude of Jews driven from the Iberian Peninsula in the reign of the Catholic Monarchs credited with reconquering Spain from the Moors.  Harassed by the Inquisition, many found refuge in the Calvinist Netherlands.  Nadler shows how tolerance and dogma fought continuously in the Dutch Republic, reaching every facet of society.  Politics and religion were deeply intertwined.  Even a reclusive like Spinoza wasn't immune to the swaying fortunes of party politics.  While the Dutch struggled for an independent existence surrounded by enemy states, Spinoza formulated his ideas on Nature and the role of the divine.  He began these studies at an early age.  Expressing them led to the most vehement statement of excommunication issued by the Amsterdam rabbinical leadership.<br />He spent the remainder of his life in near-seclusion, with occasional visits with friends and other thinkers.  The time was spent in preparing what became his most significant work - The Ethics.<br />Spinoza, a deep scholar of Scripture and Nature, refused to countenance a human aspect for the deity.  Instead, as Nadler explains, Spinoza merged the deity and Nature into one.  Humans, he insisted, were merely part of the scheme, not something apart. To be good was part of the divine plan.  Evil, while deplorable, was derived from natural causes.  Evil should be controlled, it should not be condemned.  The State must have a role, but it must be under the direction of an enlightened populace.  He scorned Utopian ideas, but found much to admire in the Dutch Republic's scheme.  To Spinoza, the worst aspect of Netherland politics was the intrusion of the Reformed Church in government affairs.  Spinoza condemned all dogma and superstition - both being symbolic of the various churches, Christian or Jewish.  He published but one major work in his lifetime.  The Theological and Political Treatise was roundly condemned by most European theologians, who goaded the states to follow suit.  There is a special irony in Spinoza escaping the martyrdom some suffered for lesser views.  Instead, he appears to have perished from a combination of inherited susceptibility to respiratory ailments and inhaled dust from his lens grinding.<br />Nadler's account is sound scholarship presented confidently.  There are no frills nor wild speculations.  Where he tries to resolve an issue in question, he does it firmly and with good sources.  Where evidence is lacking, and there is very little on Spinoza that can be considered reliable, he indicates this without apology.  A good bibliography and a few illustrations grace the book.

The wealth of new information on the brain is forcing us to re-think what the mind is and how it works.  Churchland offers the most comprehensive and understandable overview of these challenges currently in print.  This outstanding panoramic view of &quot;brain science&quot; provides any reader with challenging questions and offers means to derive the answers.  These come not from the reader's knowledge of cognitive science, but from the applicaton  of logic.  Churchland imposes few responses of her own.  Fluent in the science and its presentation, she has varied experience in cognitive science.  Her earlier book &quot;Neurophilosophy&quot; coined a term indicating where further work is needed and how the results might be applied.  This book brings us up to date and enlarges on that earlier study.<br />The book is well organized with a superb Introduction surveying the history of thinking on the mind-body relationship.  Brain research, hindered by physical difficulties and traditional thinking, was slower to develop than other sciences, such as astronomy or physics.  The fundamental organization of brain structure and mechanics are well described and illustrated.  The remaining body of the book discusses the three &quot;big questions&quot; philosophy has dealt with over the millenia: Metaphysics, Epistomology and Religion.  Each topic is defined with an historical synopsis.  Applications of the brain's reaction to phenomena as applied to the subject fill the remainder of each section.  Bibliographies and Internet sites are listed at the end of each section within the topic.<br />The questions she poses are the &quot;deep&quot; ones - pondered and debated for centuries.  We call them &quot;deep&quot; because all prior thinking and arguing hasn't resolved them.  What, she asks, is the neurobiological basis of consciousness, the self, and free choice?  Churchland contends that neurosciences are, at last, bringing answers in view.  Her queries aren't limited to classroom debate.  She addresses ideas many of us have pondered.  Her approach is still novel in the minds of many - she wishes to merge science and philosophy into an integrated discipline. This seems simple, but the task is immense.  Tackling it with confidence, she proposes methods for the merger and applies examples.<br />Churchland simply asks, &quot;what is the evidence supporting the notion?&quot;.  If there is no buttress available, she urges dismissal of the idea in favour of a new thesis.  She teaches us to look for ourselves - what are the pitfalls of blind acceptance?  The traps we have fallen into may be filled in with empirical evidence.  The result, she stresses, is a sounder footing for our thinking about many issues, moral, psychological and ethical.<br />Classifying this book as a &quot;textbook&quot; may have been appropriate for the earlier edition, clearly this volume goes beyond the realm of academia.  Churchland's expressive style makes the issues available to anyone interested in the subjects of belief, behaviour, &quot;free will&quot; and how we deal with them.  Churchland has adapted an effective trove of illustrative material to enhance her excellent prose.  Ranging from photographs through various graphics, the illustrations provide further explanation of the points she makes. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]swers in view.

Unbound by consensus thinking, he shows how the brain and body collaborate in forming what we call the &quot;mind&quot;.  In this book he reaches back in time to the works of Baruch Spinoza, perhaps the first philosopher with insights on emotions and will.  Spinoza roundly refuted the separation of mind and body postulated by Descartes - a thesis with amazing tenacity.  Damasio wants to revive the teachings of Spinoza in light of modern research's recent findings verifying and enlarging the Dutch philosopher's ideas.  He possesses a unique style in supporting his campaign, with an ability to mix conversational and clinical presentations with fluid ease.  This is his finest effort.<br />Damasio blithely overturns traditional philosophy by giving the body a primary role in developing emotions.  What the mind feels, the body has already expressed.  Because the body and brain are so deeply integrated in their functions, the combined signals are manifested as &quot;emotion&quot;.  Our feelings of joy, sorrow and the host of other classifications we use in defining ourselves are the expressions of the interactions.  What we say about feelings may be applied to the entire realm of what we call &quot;awareness&quot;.  In short, the mind represents the body - we react to its actions.  Spinoza, without realizing it, was far in advance of his contemporaries.<br />Damasio uses the wealth of research he and others have obtained over many years to support his contentions.  In line with those in the forefront of &quot;neurophilosophy&quot;, Damasio attributes  evolutionary roots for his proposal.  Other animals, he reminds us, react in similar ways to similar stimuli.  They haven't the ability to express their reactions in language, but the body language says it sufficiently.  Human evolution merely took these root causes a step further.  Language, however, and the urge to detach us from the rest of the animal kingdom led us to also separate mind and body.  Damasio, following both Spinoza and the finds of cognitive science, seeks to restore the integration.<br />With an intelligible prose style, enhanced by diagrams and line drawings, this book is a treasure of information.  The questions he raises, while jarring to anyone steeped in traditional philosophy, need answering.  He's never above noting where more work is required and posits topics to be investigated.  The extensive bibliography is valuable in understanding what we know and what remains to be revealed.  These revelations, Damasio reminds us, apply further afield than academic disputes over philosophical issues.  The view of mind and body underlies most of our concepts of justice, government, public education and social behaviour generally.  What gives this book its ultimate value is what basis we apply in addressing these issues.  If traditional philosophy's foundation is a false bulwark, we must replace it with a more rational basis.  Spinoza had not patience with arguments from ignorance, Damasio states.  Nor should you.

In this book his view is global in extent and delves into deep time.  Using one of the most cataclysmic events of modern times as a focus, he explains mysterious processes in the Earth, global communications and the roots of capitalism.  Well researched and written in his usual animated style, Winchester relates a stirring and informative account.  Richly illustrated with maps, photos and diagrams, this book encompasses much in minimal space.<br />He opens with a tribute to a nearly forgotten child's book, W.P. du Bois' &quot;The Twenty-one Balloons&quot;.  This fantasy story symbolises the persistence of the memory we retain of the 1883 volcanic destruction of Krakatoa.  Winchester examines the many facets that kept that memory active - the mystique of volcanoes, the vivid sunsets, the rise of a &quot;global village&quot; concept.  Like it or not, the &quot;global village&quot; would never have emerged without the rise of modern imperialist powers.  Pepper is a starting point, and Winchester explains how the Dutch became masters of the Spice Islands.  In no small measure it was because the Dutch East-India Company [VOC] was flexibly structured - wielding immense local power distant from its headquarters.  The joint-stock company became the foundation for corporations which are today straddling the globe and have exceeded governments in size, income and power.<br />Winchester shows how the needs of business led to the development of the global telegraph network.  While Krakatoa was building internal pressures for its destructive finale, telegraph cables were being laid on the sea beds.  These were designed to link business interests.  However, the links imparted many forms of news.  Krakatoa's eruption became the first natural event gaining global attention.  The subsequent investigations resulted in further research ultimately culminating in today's knowledge of continental drift.  The impact on weather spurred better understanding of climatic mechanisms.<br />This account is rich in detail and descriptively vivid.  The author weaves people, events and environment together seamlessly.  You are intimately placed with the participants in the face of the catastrophe as well as the more prosaic daily circumstances.  With so many facets brought to play around the eruption, it's difficult to impart them all here.  Winchester's personal observations play no small part in the narrative.  His account of the concept of plate tectonics is given with all the awe derived from newly acquired knowledge.<br />While the book is a valuable overview of many fields, Winchester has a tendency to let certain &quot;causes&quot; override his narrative.  He, along with other historians, takes up the reputation of Alfred Russel Wallace, co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection - &quot;Darwinism&quot;.  Wallace's reputation needs refurbishing, but not at the cost of Darwin's.  Winchester argues that Darwin and Wallace derived their ideas simultaneously.  This is simply false, as Darwin had been formulating his presentation for two decades.<br />Winchester ignores Dutch Calvinism while he builds a case for the rise of Islamic fundamentalism.  The omission is inexcusable.  The Dutch Protestants didn't make an issue of religion in their colonial enterprises [unlike the Spanish], leaving Islam to flourish.  He offers no analysis of the religious aspects, instead focussing on business and administrative aspects of Dutch imperialism.  He explains his rationale by stating the rise of Islamic militant fundamentalism took place shortly after the eruption &quot;is one of those historical coincidences too attractive to ignore&quot;.  Perhaps he should have left this issue to another book and done a more complete job.

Spencer Wells provides an enthralling overview of the research tracking changes in the Y [male] chromosome.  The studies verify again that our origins are African.  Somewhere, around 60 000 years ago, lived one man, a flesh and blood individual, from whom we've all descended.  His progeny, in an amazingly short span, scattered around the globe.  The scattering isn't news, but the verification of the paths and chronology is lucid and vividly outlined in this book.<br />The key to the tracking, as Wells makes abundantly clear, are various polymorphisms [changes] in the Y chromosome.  These mutations are reflected in today's populations and the rate of their diversity indicates the approximate age of the various regional groups.  These changes, nearly all prefixed &quot;M&quot; [male?] are used as ingredients in recipes Wells offers as illustrative metaphor.  It's a clever ploy, so long as you remember ingredients may only be added, never removed nor replaced.  That's how genetics works, he reminds us.  He portrays the build-up of recipe ingredients with maps and diagrams.  The diagrams are almost redundant as the clarity of his prose enables you to envision them.<br />Following the paths of migration, Wells shows how some archaeological finds offer support for the patterns he sees.  Fossils are rare, elusive and sometimes misunderstood.  Genetics, buried deep in our cells, are unequivocal in providing their evidence.  Dating methods are briefly described and their shortcomings mercilessly paraded.  Wells doesn't give the paleoanthropologists much voice.  His story needs telling and the reader may go elsewhere for countering information.  Yet he acknowledges the importance of confirming information from various digs around the world.<br />Wells firmly addresses a great anomaly - if modern humans arose from the evolutionary bouillabaisse about 60 millennia ago, how did the Aborigines arrive in Australia at nearly the same time?  His answer is that the track followed shore routes, not inland ones.  Hunter-gatherer groups, subject to the whims of climate, food resources and population pressure took the softest trail.  Africa to Australia during ice ages was a gentle, if lengthy, stroll.<br />Nit-picking department:  Wells' opening gun is turned on the racial &quot;expert&quot; Carleton Coon, who asserted the human races each followed a separate evolutionary path.  Coon has been refuted in so many ways by so many researchers, Wells' effort seems superfluous.  There are more competent scientists adhering to the &quot;Multiregional&quot; thesis.  Some of these researchers might have been given a small voice in an annotated bibliography.  While Wells offers a reading list for each chapter, a full bibliography would be an enhancement.  Many of his references are remote.  That doesn't tarnish the value of this book.

To some, Richard Dawkins is threatening.  His phrases pry open shut minds.  His words bend and flex rigid thinking.  His ideas trash dearly held dogmas.  And, of course, he idolizes The Devil's Chaplain - Charles Darwin [the title is from a letter of Darwin's].  He performs all these feats with a graceful style - one which anyone writing science should study.  This collection is comprised of letters, book reviews and even eulogies - an unusual vehicle for espousing the cause of rational thinking.  If much of his writing seems intense, it's because he recognizes his role in waging an uphill battle against &quot;established truths&quot;, no matter how false they prove.  To show the validity of truth over myth requires a direct approach.<br />Dawkins recognizes that people abhor being called animals.  The continuity of life, one of the major themes in this collection, remains an indisputable fact, he stresses.  This series reinforces Dawkins' attempts to make us aware that we are part of Nature.  He is always witty, using his sound scientific basis and rationale to keep us informed.  Science, in his view, must not be eroded by baseless tradition nor false dogmas.  The goal of living, he argues, is the understanding of life itself.  Religion and philosophy have failed abysmally, the realm of science should be given its opportunity.  It's a broad view, sustained by an ability to grasp it firmly.  Better yet, for us, it's presented here with verve and dedication.<br />Segregated into [lucky!] seven sections, each addressing a general theme.  He covers many topics in this anthology - evolution, of course, but medicine, genetically modified foods [many foods are hybrids resulting from genetic manipulation], jury trials, intellectual heresies, and even government policies are included.  The arrangement presents no difficulty - in fact, each offering might be chosen at random without losing any impact.  Selecting a favourite is an arduous task [although it promotes re-reading] but the review of Sokal and Bricmont's &quot;Fashionable Nonsense&quot; ranks very high.  The review demonstrates Dawkins' many talents, from insight to incisiveness.  Few essayists provide the imagery he can attain to explain an idea.<br />There are those, particularly adherents of the idea that science lacks morality, who see scientists as cold and distant.  Dawkins shows how false this idea is with his laudatory comments on John Diamond, Douglas Adams and William Hamilton.  He even extends an olive branch to his academic opponent, the late Stephen J. Gould.  As fellow evolutionists, Dawkins and Gould forged a rapport against the rants and duplicities of the Christian creationists.  It requires a broad mind to take such steps, and narrowness isn't among Dawkins' blemishes.  He's a feeling human being and a tireless campaigner.  We would all do well to heed and emulate him.

And obtain it?  Once again, Pratchett offers readers a rich banquet of deep philosophic questions served with his saucy wit.  As usual the repast may be taken lightly, skimming off the quirky characters - the Raven takes the top marks in this book - or the horrid puns emanating from the music [Welsh for Buddy Holly??!! arghh!].  Otherwise, the gourmet PTerry fan may relish fully the issues surrounding life.  And death.  Pratchett, as always, may be read at many levels.  Any Discworld book may be read repeatedly, and this one is no exception.<br />Death is unique among the Four Horsemen - he's the only one that's inevitable.  As an Anthropomorphic Personification, Death is something other than simply a blind force.  Small feelings burrow through his consciousness.  Without a human frame of reference, he cannot comprehend them fully.  He is, however, aware that things aren't quite right.  He therefore goes off to determine what is wrong.  His departure leaves a void demanding filling.<br />His replacement is the daughter of his foundling and his apprentice - Susan Sto Helit.  With Susan, Pratchett turns away from Death to examine Life.  In this instance, Life shows how powerful it can be, even self generating.  Life, the universe itself, may be the result of a musical note.  Never mind the Big Bang, how about the Big Bong?  Life, through Music, shows its universality through Music With Rocks In.  Rock music can be performed by everyone.  Talent, discipline, training all may be ignored.  Music With Rocks In is little more than the fullest expression of human feeling.  Even Susan, much detached from her surroundings, is caught up in its force.<br />In Susan, Pratchett demonstrates the power of his characterisation.  She is Death's granddaughter, carrying his &quot;genes&quot; providing inexplicable powers.  She can speak with THE VOICE, become invisible, ride Binky.  She's human, with a strong sense of justice, vexed by  the loss of good people and the survival of bad ones.  She wants Death to be &quot;fair&quot;, but He can only be what he is - inevitable.  Pratchett, of course, must somehow reconcile these views, which he does with his usual panache.  Through it all, the Music strives for survival.  Pratchett feels that's important because it means survival for us all.

A glance at Simonton's bibliography will confirm that observation.  His own efforts to define the roots of creativity are of long standing.  This work artfully assembles this wealth of information, placing it squarely within a &quot;Darwinian perspective&quot;.  With a modest disclaimer, Simonton sees this book as &quot;one long argument&quot;, the phrase Darwin applied to Origin.  He's correct to do so.  This book exemplifies how far Darwin's ingenious idea of natural selection can reach.  Simonton's well organised and clearly presented survey of the roots of creativity is an noteworthy effort.<br />Darwin himself provides the pivotal focus in Simonton's study.  He explains how Darwin's work is symbolised by a combination of genius, creativity and the capacity for hard work to bring ideas to fruition.  He postulates two forms of &quot;Darwinism&quot; - primary, the purely biological and the secondary which he describes as &quot;adaptive with environmental interaction&quot;.  He strives to relate how primary Darwinism underlies the secondary form where genius can emerge.  It's clear from his analysis that genius doesn't &quot;just happen&quot;.  Many elements are involved, and most or all must be brought into play to express creativity and have ideas disseminated to the wider world.<br />Simonton places heavy reliance on the model proposed by Donald Campbell.  Campbell proposed an &quot;ideational&quot; concept with the creative mind coping with rich variations of concepts and ways of expressing them.  From this foundation Simonton goes on to discuss individual differences and how these fit within a Darwinian framework.  From the individual, he analyses the &quot;product&quot; of the creative mind.  In what is certain to arouse protest, he shows how the creative process is as &quot;blind&quot; in &quot;seeking results&quot; as is biological selection itself.  The &quot;product&quot; is neither predictable nor easily fit into simple causation.<br />Simonton's ideas have been thoroughly researched with the limits of available data.  He has proposed a novel thesis in a fresh and readable manner.  As a lighter touch, he offers a survey of the research linking genius with madness.  While there will be much dissent, perhaps even acrimony in response to his ideas, it's certain much more research will result from his suggestions.  If nothing else, that will keep this book as a point of focus for some time.

Marks wants to keep apes and humans separate.  Fair enough.  I don't want to live on termites on a stick, and it's doubtful chimps want to worry about traffic congestion, tax rates or political corruption.  Marks wants scientists to do their job well.  Who can argue?  Marks has courage - he has the temerity to assault the venerable E. O. Wilson, the articulate Richard Dawkins and the revered Jane Goodall.  Marks is against racism.  Hardly debatable.  Marks seems a pretty upstanding fellow.  Why then, is this book such an insult to the intelligence?<br />Mostly because it is a froth of misleading statements, misdirected wrath, misconceptions and mistaken views of science.  Marks goes to unusual lengths in dismissing the research achievements of many scientists in both field and laboratory.  He blithely dismisses the disclosure that chimpanzee and human genes are nearly identical as \\"the most overly exposed factoid in modern science.\\"  It's not significant because it confuses precision with accuracy.  From there, Marks goes on to castigate a legion of scientists for their failure to \\"get it right\\" the first time around.  Few escape his lash - even Linneaus, who virtually invented classifying life, is a victim, and perpetrator, of cultural artifacts in naming species.  This from a man who finds culture an unbridgeable chasm between humans and animals!<br />Marks spends much of the remainder of the book discussing racial/cultural undercurrents in science.  He finds far too much of it in current anthropology.  He's correct in this, but his case is \\"overblown\\"- a favourite phrase of his.  In a welter of complaints, he finds but two scientists to exonerate of the charge:  Richard Leowntin and - himself.  He doesn't want any cultural or behavioural relationship between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom, a favourite plaint of Lewontin's.  Any hint of sociobiology, which he incorrectly defines as the study of human behaviour, must be rejected.  This attitude ignores the wealth of research published during the past generation.<br />Marks' shots against sociobiology would be amusing except that so many will accept them uncritically.  Like his mentor, Marks wants humanity to evolve without any evolutionary baggage.  Behavioural studies of modern animals are irrelevant according to Marks.  Thus is cast aside the whole realm of Darwin's evolution by natural selection.  At least as far as it concerns humans.  This attitude fits adroitly with Marks' intended reader community.  He blames science for many social attitudes, delving deeply into the history of science to build his case.  His brief runs from Plato onward, ending with the efforts to map the human genome.  Science has long suffered from its cultural roots.  The case is flawed by Marks failure to recognize that all through history, science has sought to reveal natures' secrets.  It's a process of fits and starts, each gain a limited success.  That inability to  \\"get it all right the first time\\" is inherent in the process.  It accomplishes little to portray the process as invalid.  If some people have not performed to his expectations doesn't mean science should give up trying.<br />The area that Marks clearly wants abandoned is understanding of what drives human beings.  That some scientists want to look more deeply into the human genome he perceives as a wasted effort.  Along with Lewontin, Marks rails against \\"genes for\\" this or that aspect of life - particularly human life.  Are we to assume then that we should stop looking?  Because faulty genes have been shown to invoke certain disorders but haven't been found for others, is the list now complete?  He inveighs against looking for genes for criminal behaviour.  We don't know enough about how DNA works to decide one way or another.  Do we give up analysing how genes perform?  And what exactly is criminal behaviour?  Even  Marks uses statistics of prisonpopulations to build his case.  But none of the Enron executives are in prison, nor are likely to be.  Do we exclude them from genetic analysis to unravel what genes lead us to do?<br />This book will go far in inflaming the already anti-scientific attitude prevalent in North American schools.  Statements such as \\"science is not generally accurate\\" and \\"scientific statements are routinely falsified\\" [p. 279] aren't likely to entice anyone into the scientific fold.  Students will not be encouraged to enter science disciplines when they're told \\"it is no easier to get the average scientist to accept responsibility than it is to get the average four-year-old to accept responsibility.  After all, Marks is a scientist himself, his statements must be valid.  We must assume, it is supposed, that he and Lewontin stand alone by having donned the mantle of responsibility.  Yet his book is permeated with complaints that statements made by other scientists have been uncritically accepted.  Marks owes the scientific community an apology.

The politics of that creation, however, he leaves to others.  Instead, he addresses the underlying conditions of Dutch society of the period.  At the outset, he decrees he will avoid Culture in favour of culture.  This welcome departure makes this book a treasure of information.  However, it isn't a volume for the novice.  Much background history in Enlightenment Europe in general and the Dutch role in particular, is required before tackling this book.<br />That a beached whale can become a cultural artefact seems aberrant at first glance.  The Dutch, as Calvinists, could find a moral message in a wide disparity of events.  Whale beachings proved no exception.  Pamphlets, articles, even books could make use of cetacean corpses to invoke metaphors of nationalism, extravagance, profit, indulgence and divine messages.  Schama shows how easily the besieged Protestant nation at the edge of Catholic Europe found means to justify and define their existence.  This form of thinking and expression gave the Dutch strength to sustain a novel experiment in society and nationhood.  It also refutes the suggestion that the Dutch were governed by a dogmatist Calvinism.  Flexibility and tolerance, no matter how often challenged, remained the foundation of Dutch culture.  Against all odds, the Republic survived and flourished.<br />The flourishing becomes the pivotal point in Schama's account.  The influx of riches from global trade challenged aspects of Calvinist values.  Extravagance was condemned, but not impaired.  The lure of commerce was strong and the accumulation of wealth too rapid to be hampered.  Calvinist ministers might rail at the influx of gold, but their wrath was constrained by a society manifestly stable.  Excesses remained rare as the burghers pursued their wealth soberly.  Ostentation, Schama notes, didn't mean extravagance.<br />As Schama clearly describes, flourishing trade opened minds as well as purses.  Opinions flourished with bank accounts and the Dutch Enlightenment attracted exiles from more dogmatic societies.  He pulls together many threads in weaving his tapestry of Dutch culture, enhanced by numerous illustrations conveying the wealth of allegorical images used to influence social and national mores.  The varieties of thinking meant that the Dutch Republic came into existence without an underlying ideology or dogma.  Even the Republic's  borders remained too fluid to establish a certain national identity from them.<br />If there are faults in Schama's sweeping account, they are few, but significant.  An introductory chapter on the chronology of events would ease the novice's entry to this weighty narrative.  His focus, while a needed supplement to general histories, is a bit tight.  He spends many pages recounting the history of a single midwife as exemplary.  On the other hand, the role of immigrants is given short shrift.  Jewish contacts in Iberia and the New World were an important facet of economic growth.  Trade with the Far East is granted only marginally more attention.  As the roots of \\"the embarrassment of riches\\" one would expect more attention be given them.  He ignores many major thinkers, perhaps slotting them into his disdained Culture.  Yet many major figures of the era go begging for ink space in his book - Spinoza, Descartes and others were not writing for themselves.  Even posthumously, their opinions affected the thinking of literate Dutch - and in a burgher society, there were many of those.

Wegner postulates our belief in complete control of our voluntary actions is an illusion.  Who, then, is in control of our thoughts and behaviour?  In an ideal scientific portrayal of how our minds work all the relevant factors might be analysed in detail and reassembled to duplicate the processes leading to a particular action.  That, he argues, isn't a practical solution to understanding.  &quot;Free will&quot;, debated by religions, science, philosophy and law, is too simplistic a concept in Wegner's view.  There are too many forces impinging on our minds, affecting our behaviour and outlook, to endorse our commonly held view of how much we control we actually exercise.  In a well written account of how these outside forces are received and acted on, Wegner presents an abundance of examples.  His easygoing style makes this book a pleasurable read.<br />Anyone seeking simple concepts will not find this book fulfilling.  There are many facets to examine in determining how our minds work.  Simple answers and concepts have no place here.  On the surface, his examples of outside forces may seem bizarre to the newcomer to these ideas.  The famous horse, Clever Hans, who fooled many for years, may seem out of place in a study of human will.  How can animal actions be meaningful in such a treatise?  The example points up, however, how subtle the forces affecting our thoughts and actions can be.  Human brain malfunctions also show the distinction between what we view as &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;aberrant&quot; behaviour.  In examining some of these conditions, Wegner leads us through spirit mediums, Oujia Boards, &quot;channeling&quot;, and hypnotism.  It seems like a journey through a fantasy land, but each example makes a telling point in supporting his case that the idea that our actions remain within our control is illusory.<br />None of this is to suggest, he argues finally, that we have no influence on what we do.  He merely wants to make us aware of those other forces.  Some are easily understood, but easily overlooked - social forces are the chief example.  &quot;Have another piece of pie&quot; repeated until we partake, seemingly &quot;against our will&quot;.  Not telling off the boss when she's been foolish.  The examples are common and frequent, Wegner notes, but we don't view them as modifying our concept of &quot;free will&quot; as we should.

Keneally uses the high point of the Southron Confederacy as the setting for this brilliant historical novel.  Reaching through the ranks, he selects a Shenandoah Valley private and his mates - &quot;confederates&quot; - to reveal the horrors of war with vivid reality.  Usaph Bumpass moves with Stonewall Jackson's Virginians through the Valley and into the first Confederate invasion of the North.  Through it all Usaph carries concerns about his &quot;swamp tramp&quot; Ephaphtha living at the edge of the combat area.  Her loyalty, her past, her well-being, all intrude on his thoughts while he's trying to survive.  Never once, however, does he question why he's in the war.  The Confederacy is a miasma of conflicting values.  Even natives of the South have uncertain views of what precisely is the &quot;cause&quot; they're fighting for.  Keneally ably presents us with these variations of philosophy and the people holding them.<br />Equally fluent in passion or pathos, Keneally's describes battles, intrigues and romance conveyed with powerful reality.  With a solid research foundation, he fashions images of people and events with superb clarity.  From domestic struggles to the clash of battles, we share every emotional upheaval. Keneally portrays the intensity of war with an surprising clarity as it cuts off friend and foe alike.  For a man who once trained for the priesthood, he places the reader alongside his people with deceptive ease.

Rich Harris sweeps away those reams of paper and tankards of ink with a grandiloquent gesture.  What determines a child's behaviour?  The acrimonious debates of many years over the role of genetics versus parental guidance are shown redundant by this excellent work.  In short, once a child encounters peers, on the street, in school, even a working environment, it is those peers and their attitudes that nudge behaviour in various directions.  Well written and firmly researched, Harris has offered a real breakthrough in understanding child development.<br />Harris starts out with a simple truth we all know and rarely \\"see\\".  All children are different.  They differ from parents and each other.  Even identical twins, those mythical examples of matching traits, turn out to exhibit variations in taste, dress and habits.  Clearly, she notes, there is more to child development than genes.  On the other hand, why, she asks, are parents under such stress to \\"make children behave\\" [or submit, or learn the piano, or . . .].  Harris demonstrates that an outside force, one poorly perceived and often unrecognized, leads children along unexpected paths.<br />Her first clue was language.  She notes immigrants to North America who adhere to their original language and culture norms produce children who adhere to values here from an early age.  That was the pointer leading her to create the idea of \\"group socialization\\".  A child's playmates and school chums can communicate at levels parents don't understand.  Playground or street values aren't home values.  As children progress through school or a work environment, peer forces can guide them in new directions.  Parents may have some impact, but they lose much of their influence very early.<br />Harris recognises the novelty of her concept.  There are years of study by \\"socialization researchers\\" who have arrived at various conclusions, often widely accepted, about the impact of parenting methods on children.  Harris argues most of these are flawed in method or misleading in conclusions.  Even one of its most recognized practitioners ultimately admitted the published findings were unsubstantiated.  Of greater concern was that these studies have produced heavy guilt feelings in parents.  When the recommended methods don't produce anticipated results \\"it must be my fault\\".  Harris wants to set those troubled minds at rest by understanding the real forces involved.<br />The author doesn't absolve parents from influence on development.  She merely recommends a new approach based on the new information.  Peers may drive behaviour in unwanted directions, but parents still have the responsibility and power to set limits.  Peer groups can be \\"chosen\\", chiefly through school choice.  The evolutionary roots of a child's \\"normal\\" group of siblings and close relations has been broken down by modern society.  Harris reminds us that the \\"nuclear family\\" is a recent, artificial concept.  Modern social structure distinctly  departure from long-established group forms.  Parents must adapt to these new forms, chiefly through greater attention to how to place their children in supportive environments.  It can be done; it has been done.  We only need to shed long-held beliefs of parental inadequacies and take charge.<br />This book has, of course, proven contentious.  Anyone overthrowing cherished beliefs, no matter how poorly founded, will be resisted.  Her findings, however, fill a niche long unidentified or misunderstood.  She's fully aware that not all the information is to hand.  How big does a group have to be to influence a child?  What makes a group leader?  A follower?  These remain unanswered questions.  The value of this book is in asking such questions and demanding answers.  That value will remain undiminished until the research is done.  Read this book and learn the questions.  It is the lives of children that are at stake.[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada.][stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada.]	2003-09-09

Gabrielle Walker's first book portrays the struggle of a renegade scientist to establish a theory of evolution's progress.  Charles Lyell's established &quot;uniformitarianism&quot; in geology, followed by Charles Darwin's application of it in his theory of evolution by natural selection.  The concept of gradual change in life as reflected in the fossil evidence is being challenged by some scientist.  Paul Hoffman's research in Namibia indicated that Earth was subjected to an intense Ice Age prior to the Cambrian, severely interrupting life's progress.  Walker introduces us to Hoffman and other major contestants in this game of reading the rocks.  She presents him and the arguments with dynamic style, giving the book a certain panache.<br />Even under Walker's admiring scrutiny, Hoffman doesn't appear as an endearing figure.  Yet, the very characteristics some find irritating are the same drives that kept the theory of Snowball Earth alive.  Walker shows how combative science can be, with contenders sniping and quarreling like feuding families.  They all have fossils, climate mechanisms and glacial processes on show.  Walker attempts to give them all a hearing, but the opponents make but cameo appearances.  She gathered her evidence by extensive journeys - her travel budget must have been prodigious.  Walker reveals their peccadilloes and their strengths.  When you are done, you feel a sense of identity, even intimacy with them.<br />Whether you are convinced of the thesis remains problematic.  Walker's own sketchy knowledge forces a pause, wondering about the validity of her presentation.  Her admission of being a &quot;Snowball Earth groupie&quot; erodes credibility.  She offers many assertions as givens, such as the asteroid dinosaur extinction thesis.  Theory popularity is good journalism, but sketchy science.  Her journalist role leads her to overuse of buzzwords - &quot;Slimeworld&quot;, the habit of bacteria to form mats - achieves fatiguing redundancy.<br />The predominant question, which Walker addresses only superficially, examines what process life underwent under these conditions.  There was life before the Cambrian - clearly multi-cellular.  How complex was it, and how resistant to the environmental crisis evoked by the Snowball Earth hypothesis?  Ediacaran life was shallow sea bottom or surface dwelling.  An ice blanket a kilometre or more thick would have been devastating to this population.  Walker and her &quot;group&quot; are unable to form a coherent thesis of how life achieved complexity after the Snowball's meltdown, only that it must have happened - otherwise &quot;we wouldn't be here&quot;.  A valid statement, but one needing further support for how it might have occurred.<br />Walker's personalised account makes engaging reading, presenting a new idea needing more attention.  While various modifications of the Snowball Earth notion have been offered, final judgment remains deferred.  This is a good, but limited, overview of the debate and the participants.  At some point, someone qualified will enlighten us further.

We sometimes need to be reminded that knowledge of our universe is gained through innovative thinking.  Marcus Chown has rounded up a number of novel ideas, along with their originators and supporters.  He presents these speculations along with their criticisms and defenses.  Chown is careful to show why these novel ideas are worth considering and supporting the research in its quest for fuller understanding.  If for nothing else, this book is valuable for introducing new concepts and why we should remain open-minded about scientific theorizing.<br />Chown's breezy style doesn't obscure his grasp of the sciences.  He's conversant with the science and presents the radical views in a conversational format.  Dividing the ideas into three sections, he begins with some fundamental issues in physics, relates some new ideas in cosmology, and examines facets of the anthropic principle.  We learn of multiple dimensions tucked away in the depths of atoms.  Are there other universes neighbouring ours, but with different properties?  Are there maverick planets drifting through the universe, but with life present, sustained by internal heat?  How did life originate on this planet - or did it truly originate here?  There are many formidable mysteries involved, but Chown's ability in narrating them keeps them within our grasp.  His description of Hoyle and Wikramsinghe's<br />&quot;panspermia&quot; idea is one of the best summaries available.<br />Chown has no illusions that these issues stand outside the mainstream of today's science.  That is the point of his making this effort - embodied in his subtitle &quot;the making of tomorrow's science&quot;.  Bizarre ideas, he reminds us, doesn't mean that they're crazy.  Science is full of the unusual.  Many of the things we accept as &quot;normal&quot; today were unheard of even in our lifetimes.  Someone pursued that &quot;crazy&quot; idea to give us things like personal computers or digital television.  He understands how much research needs support, even when the issues don't appear &quot;practical&quot; for everyday life.  Much work remains and he's encouraging anyone interested in pursuing fresh ideas.

This book overturns many long-held ideas, replacing them with fresh insights on how our minds and bodies interact.  Not afraid to tackle the big questions, Damasio offers a rich, substantial analysis of how our brains and bodies interact.  That interaction is called our &quot;mind&quot;.  It's not always easy to see how these two aspects of ourselves are so intimately merged, but Damasio makes it all clear in this book.  Why does consciousness feel to us in the manner it does?<br />Essential to Damasio's analysis of consciousness is his division of it.  &quot;Core&quot; consciousness is the brain's &quot;automatic&quot; processes - breathing, heartbeat and the countless other biological functions.  &quot;Extended&quot; consciousness is the realm of memory, conception, &quot;thinking&quot; and other aspects we generally associate with the mind.  The latter are those featured in most cognitive studies, which he argues are inadequate.  Damasio stresses repeatedly that the &quot;core&quot; - &quot;extended&quot; distinction isn't absolute.  The links between core and extended consciousness are multiple and varied.  They occur in many places in the brain and its association with the rest of the body.  He calls for further studies on those interactions as the foundation for a better understanding of full consciousness.<br />Damasio has particularly fine presentation skills.  He puts us at ease in describing his patients, his theories and how they fit together.  His patients, after all, are only us with some brain disturbance.  Many are people we could encounter daily.  They have, however, suffered some malady that disconnects essential parts of their brains' mechanism.  Damasio explains in an intimate conversational style what they are suffering. Consciousness in these people has been impaired.  The impairment is in the realm of emotion and feeling.<br />Those two terms are the core of Damasio's thesis.  Unlike mainstream cognitive scientists, he separates them, with one being the &quot;public&quot; expression and the other private.  Feelings belong to us, where emotions are shared with the world.  He is breaking new ground in cognitive studies with his work.  The result is a highly detailed book, with intense examination of brain operations.  A reader unfamiliar with these topics may find the book increasingly challenging as you progress through the topics.  The rewards for persistence, however, are rich.  Damasio has provided an innovative scenario of how consciousness is structured.

Books	2	14	36	N	N	A masterpiece! . . .  of a priori reasoning	It's amusing, if not amazing, to witness the narrow view Christian theologians can still present in defense of indefensible stands.  This book is misconceived, misdirected, and mostly mistaken.  Although he posits a question about &quot;a&quot; god in his title, Swinburne immediately asserts there is but one - &quot;the&quot; god.  &quot;The&quot; god, ignoring all the others still revered by non-christians, is the basis of all things, according to Swinburne.  Polytheism is complex.  Monotheism is simple, providing simple answers to complex issues.  Nature is wonderful, mysterious, enigmatic.  Only a single deity behind the scenes  provides sufficient explanation for its existence and mechanics, he asserts.  From governing atomic particles to providing cures for cancer, this deity reaches across 15 billion years for the [sole?] purpose of influencing our lives.  He defines his god as &quot;person-like&quot;, although without gender, claiming there is no better appellation.  The English language still uses &quot;it&quot; to classify things lacking gender identity.  Why does Swinburne fail to use it?<br />One reason is that he wants to retain a &quot;persona&quot; for his god.  While not subject to human frailties - Swinburne conveniently ignores the &quot;wrath of god&quot; - it must work within a logical framework.  Hence, the rules underlying the universe, he states, must have a logic to give them meaning and to leave a place for humans to exist and investigate how these rules are manifested.  Swinburne is keen on logic and order.  Like other Christian intellectuals, he must accept the reality of evolution.  Accepting the idea of evolution, he argues that it is part of a divine plan.  He inveighs against the &quot;chance&quot; of selection - life is not the result of &quot;random&quot; events.  Like other Christian intellectuals, he leaves out Darwin's most important phrase -  &quot;by natural selection&quot;.  A full understanding of Darwin's idea refutes &quot;randomness&quot; entirely.  While rejecting anything &quot;random&quot; in nature, later in the book with a sublime arabesque of logic, he asserts the validity of the most random of all events - miracles.<br />Swinburne's arguments are old, weary and lack foundation.  It's not surprising he admires Paley's 1806 attempt to show the divine order of nature.  Swinburne simply uses the same logic with modern information.  This may be comforting to the Christian reader perplexed by the real-world challenges to theism, to whom Swinburne likely directed this book.  Others, seeking some rational explanation for the purpose of this book will be disappointed.  He makes the blithe statement that &quot;the evidence gives a significant degree of probability to the claim that [g]od exists&quot;.  Except for universal laws and the human ability to make such an assertion, he offers no evidence in defense of this claim.  Perhaps Daniel Dennett is correct in suggesting adherents of such ideas and tactics are best relegated to museums and zoos. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]ndomness&quot; entirely.

Almost a sequel to his previous &quot;Fishing With The Old Guy&quot;, this work is broader in scope and deeper in insight.  Quarrington isn't afraid to examine himself closely while travelling or fishing.  The result is a strongly personalised account of who he is and who he relates to in the sport.  An  avid fisherman, he makes clear that &quot;Catching&quot;, while desireable, is clearly secondary to &quot;fishing&quot; itself.  There's obviously far less stress involved in &quot;fishing&quot; than occur when landing a record size is the goal.  &quot;Fishing&quot; for itself offers a greater variety of experiences, which he recounts in his jocular style.  <br />It's the variety that makes this &quot;Paul's Book of Fish&quot;.  Beginning with a quest for the majestic Steelhead on Vancouver Island, he crosses the Rockies to the Bow for Rainbow, and the Red River near Winnepeg for the monstrous Catfish found there.  An opportunity to examine wider vistas takes him to the Bahamas for the quirky Bonefish.  It's difficult to resolve which is more humorous, the antics of the Bonefish or those of the guides he encounters there.  As he relates, guides are a major element in fishing away from local waters.  Their status is always an issue.  When their self-image confronts that of the fisherman's, the clash can be explosive.<br />Fishing, to Quarrington, is not idle time.  It can be ideal time, but when introspection intrudes, the result can be serenity or distress.  Quarrington was surely almost unique in choosing fishing as a means of coping with the events of 11 September 2001.  He confesses it was his form of escape from the &quot;disaster of unexampled order&quot; that had occured that morning.  His personal disasters, a lost marriage and a lost father, further weighted his burdened mind.  In the Bow River, well within urban boundaries, he reminds us that Isaak Walton, dean of fishers, declared fishing a &quot;contemplative pursuit&quot;.  While thus employed Quarrington floats in thoughts &quot;like a shipwrecked man in a sea of debris and sharks&quot;.   He ponders, for example, what proportional disaster might befall the fish he seeks.  By the end of the evening, a small moment of good fortune helps redeem the day.<br />In the final essay, he returns to Vancouver Island.  Always a self-effacing man, the Tsunami Lodge, Canada's most up-market fishermen's haven, nearly overwhelms him.  He uses devious means to be sent there, knowing it's beyond his reach.  He's in constant fear of exposure, but wants to record the extravagance some fishermen will expend in their pursuit.  It's a compelling piece, especially given that the article &quot;never got written&quot;.  Until now.  This finale is Quarrington at his finest.  His evasive dealings with the lodge owner, his alcoholic ramblings with colleague Jake MacDonald, and, of course, time on the water all provide an image of a man for whom fishing is far more than idle sport.  The whole collection provides views of fishing no &quot;outdoors&quot; magazine can offer.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]<br /> <BR>* With humble apologies to Richard Flanagan	2003-08-22

Few can negotiate the path with success.  Grass, who has succeeded with so many other innovative efforts, accomplishes this feat with his usual mastery.  Grass has lived through many January 30s, including Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933 and the sinking of the \\"Wilhelm Gustloff\\" in 1945, near the finale of that power.  The date threads through the book in the figure of Paul Prokriefke, born on the latter date and the story's narrator.<br />Paul is an unwilling narrator, goaded into revealing hidden events by his mother and the unnamed \\"He\\" who intrudes on his idleness.  Paul is beset on one side by Tulla, his mother who was on board when the Gustloff was torpedoed. On the other is Grass who restrains what he may write while persisting in his demand that the story be told. Paul is repeatedly confronted by his inadequacies. The greatest failure is his son, Konny, who has turned into a Nazi sympathiser and manages a Web site extolling the ship and the \\"martyr\\" for whom it was named.  The stress Paul endures is palpable.  Through it all, however, he comes to manifest what Grass wants him, and us, to see.  Western history has ignored the world's greatest sea disaster in the loss of some nine thousand lives, mostly women and children, in the closing days of the Third Reich.<br />Grass, always a masterful prose exponent, has excelled even the superb works he's previously blessed us with.  Using the metaphor of a crab's \\"scuttling from side to side\\", he moves between characters, time and events with unmatched ease and clarity.  In just over two hundred pages, he exhibits absolute control of the narrative.  No word is out of place, nothing omitted and the focus remains tight throughout the story.  The theme is sorrow - the tragedy of so many dead, the horrors of war's pointlessness, the failure of the world to understand what has happened and why it must never be repeated.  Grass makes us aware that people, ignorant of what war imposes on individuals, can be led to make the same mistakes again.  This book helps us understand what we must do to learn the truth and what steps we must take to prevent recurrence.  Otherwise, his final words will express the results of our failure:  \\"It doesn't end.  Never will it end\\".  As his readers, we must refute that conclusion by assuming our responsibilities.  The \\"ghost in the book\\" must be our chosen mentor, a role Grass undertakes gladly so long as we listen.

Divided into five general topical areas, the essay range over the evolution of human cognition, perception, religion, the trials and execution of animals and emotion.  Humphey is a major thinker.  Add his fine prose skills to the many thought experiments in this book and you have a provocative collection to enjoy.  There is much in here to inspire repeated reading.<br />Three of the essays are of significant import, requiring serious reflection on Humphrey's concepts.  What level had human cognition reached when \\"cavemen\\" painted the walls of Chauvet? [actually, two essays address this topic]  Was Jesus a conjurer?  And, foremost in significance, \\"What Shall We Tell the Children?\\".  The first question derives from the well-known case of the child Nadia who proved an artistic prodigy.  She developed an outstanding ability to draw animals by the age of four.  Her renditions of horses exceed the attempts of many adult sketchers.  Humphrey argues that Nadia's minimal language skills offer a clue to how this talent developed.  He suggests the animal drawings in French and Iberian caves suggest reconsideration of how and when human cognitive skills developed and whether artistic skills preceded those of language.<br />In discussing Jesus' role in his own society, Humphrey suggests The Redeemer had grown up in a society that anticipated the emergence of a Messiah.  In \\"Behold the Man,\\" Humphrey addresses the social and psychological\\" roots leading to the myth of Jesus' divinity.  He sees the Jesus myth as \\"setting the stage for all subsequent paranormal phenomena in Western culture . . . outside as well as inside a specifically religious context.\\"  It's a challenging task he's set himself, but Humphrey fulfills it with rational evidence.  Of primary importance is the idea that \\"Jesus himself believed he was the real thing,\\" allowing him to carry off the proposition that he enjoyed special powers.  That confidence imparted the belief to those he encountered in every community but one, his own.  Humphrey explains why that differential helps undermine the myth of divinity.  Why wasn't Jesus acceptance universal?<br />In \\"What Shall We Tell the Children?\\", Humphrey suggests one of his most challenging ideas.  How far should parents be allowed to go in forming a child's opinions and beliefs.  He strongly urges that \\"false beliefs\\" must not be imposed on children if their rights as individuals are thereby curtailed.  He argues that pre-emptive action in protecting children's rights is not an extreme action.  His solution is universal education in science - not scientific dogmas, but the methods of observation, testing and critical thinking.  No dogma ever withstands these tools in combination.<br />Three [four!] summaries hardly address the value of this collection.  The remainder, some of which are surprisingly brief, are all a challenge to think along novel lines or reassess old ideas.  Are we Stone Age people living in a Space Age or a Computer Age?  Why is dictatorship attractive to many - even those living within one?  What is the Mind/Body problem and is there an answer to it?  What is altruism and how does it work in human society?  How and why does a placebo work in curing illness?  These and many other issues are addressed in this anthology, keeping the reader's constant attention.

A enterprising editor might have boosted sales of this fine book using a different title.  Steve Gould's Panda's Thumbs and Flamingo's Smiles do well.  Jacobs' depiction of his search for African dinosaur fossils deserves no less.  Along with a fine account of his field work in Malawi and Cameroon, Jacobs' assessment of fossil composition and what it tells us about past life is illuminating.  As it happens, the structure of a crocodile's nose tells us whether it lived on land or water.  This seemingly dry fact relates to how our own skulls are organized, and why.  Deftly woven into his story of seeking dinosaur fossils, tracing the movement of continents over the face of the globe and the status of Malawi's culture in today's world, are the threads of his research.  Evolution's had a busy time of it, and Jacobs explains how to read the record of its workings.<br />Jabobs' travels and observations demolish the image of the austere scientist who cares only for his research and status within his guild.  The title isn't &quot;The Dinosaurs of Africa&quot; -  he's done that before.  Here, he's relating his journey to make those finds, updating information on what he's found.  The broader approach means learning of the travails experienced in locating the fossils, what it's like to work a dig, and how he and his team dealt with their host countries.  He leaves a valid image of a broadly caring person, untrammeled by his own cultural heritage.  Jacobs is adept at bringing the reader into his world.  That world has a long time span, with unceasing change the only constant.  He traverses millennia more easily than countries.  Justly so - there're no border guards at century boundaries.<br />African dinosaur fossils are elusive in popular science writing.  The notoriety given &quot;the Bone Wars&quot; in 19th Century North America have kept interest and funding largely curtailed to that region until recently.  Jacobs was among the first to bring the African fossil picture into view.  Although finds are being announced from that continent with increasing frequency, few of the scientists have produced a record as readable as Quest for the African dinosaurs.  Nor has there come to light other examples of the follow-up in developing local expertise Jacobs has undertaken in Malawi.  It's an inspiring story and one of interest far beyond fossil analysis.  The final chapter, &quot;The Good of Dinosaurs&quot; demonstrates how a serious scientist can express awareness of his host country and act to improve desperate conditions, even if only marginally.  &quot;One small step . . . &quot;<br />As a reissue, this book requires an editor for more than just a title.  Jacobs has a propensity for short, choppy sentences, or else some editor has betrayed him.  As it stands, many of these random statements break up the idea he's conveying.  Perhaps it's a trick to get the reader to review the prior material. Sometimes it works.  Fortunately, it doesn't detract from Jacobs efforts to convey a picture of a shifting, changing Mesozoic world and its inhabitants.

Perhaps it's a trick to get the reader to review the prior material. Sometimes it works.  Fortunately, it doesn't detract from Jacobs efforts to convey a picture of a shifting, changing Mesozoic world and its inhabitants.

Basing their analysis [if it can be called that] on but 135 women, all of them from the United States, they come to the conclusion that wimmen have a special way of knowing.  Knowing what?  Oppressive parents, demanding management, demands for academic competence?  Where do these four get the idea that these experiences are unique to women?  Men in their various endeavours experience identical fears from identical sources.  Parents have different values than your generation?  Welcome to the club.  Your boss demands that you accomplish tasks in an unreasonable amount of time?  How much midnight oil have any of us burned to complete an irrational deadline?<br />This type of book has led to the diversion of uncountable resources from areas sadly in need of support.  We now have 'wimmen's studies' in universities.  What have they contributed to a better understanding between genders?  Since they only seem to study each other, what are we gaining?  Are we learning more about people?  Suggest to women that many of their urges are biologically based [see E.O. Wilson's 'Sociobiology'] and may be as much a product of their genes as the other animals, and the lynch mob response is truly alarming.<br />It would be interesting to know just what the differences and similarities between males and females are.  We won't find out, however, so long as these quasi-cultural studies continue to sop up needed research funding.  Even if the cultural aspect is more valid than the genetic, we aren't going to find out what women 'know' until a much greater scope of research is applied.  Let these four travel to New Zealand, India, Australia, or other countries, even with a [female] translator and ask their questions.

Few, however, have the talent to weave sound philosophy within the narrative.  Pratchett introduces some thoughtful notions along with his compelling characters.  From the introduction of Esme Weatherwax in Equal Rites, he fills out the coven residing in the kingdom of Lancre with her cohorts.  Each brings a highly unique style to the craft.  Esme, acknowledged but undeclared head witch, is traditional, effective and highly sensitive to what's \\"good for people\\".  Magrat Garlick, well-read, modern and innocent [if you can reconcile those viewpoints] personifies perfectly the modern \\"Wiccan\\" mystic.  Nanny Ogg almost oozes practicality - having gone through three husbands and is served, if resentfully, by her phalanx of daughters and daughters-in-law.  The story itself, however, concerns another matter - one far more pertinent to today's world.<br />What is, or should be the role of monarchy in modern society?  Pratchett uses the Hamlet example to examine this question in a new and penetrating manner.  Kings can rise and fall through many means.  Duke Felmet, desirous of disciplined rule, fells the incumbent.  According to Pratchett, assassination is a \\"natural cause\\" of death for monarchs [as is execution, but that's elsewhere in the series].  The coven, aware that the former King Verence of Lancre has been murdered by a potential usurper, becomes protector of the heir.  It \\"protects\\" him by shipping him off with a troupe of mummers.  Thus Shakespeare as example is supplanted by parody of the playwright and his work.  The coven, however, senses what Shakespeare never expressed - monarchy's role in regard to the land and the people.<br />In Shakespeare's day, Elizabeth, the ruling monarch, expressed her love for \\"her people\\" and \\"the country\\".  She was nearly unique in that view.  Pratchett, always sensitive to nuances, employs this concern in this tale.  On a world ruled by magic, the land itself discerns the injustice of the murder, reacting with anger and pain.  Esme, who \\"borrows\\" minds, perceives the grief and gathers the coven to go beyond merely hiding the heir.  Larger questions are at stake.<br />Pratchett's ability to weave philosophical questions into what is advertised as \\"humorous fantasy\\" is what keeps him at the forefront of the genre.  His witty approach gives the widest possible audience the chance to examine the issues he raises.  If you miss them or overlook them, he still offers a fine story told in his engaging style.  If you are new to Pratchett, you can start the Discworld series comfortably here.  If you are an established fan, you will discover this to be one of his better efforts.  It is something to read more than once without eroding the pleasure of the first encounter.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]he injustice of the murder, reacting with anger and pain.

Astronomy done well is always a fascinating read, and Kaler's done a masterful job.  He takes us into the realm of the biggest, hottest, smallest, coolest, most dense and diffuse stars in our universe.  Each chapter is devoted to a type, with examples, history, evolution and likely finales.  The text is clear and unambiguous, obviously written for anyone interested in our stellar neighbours.  Diagrams and photographs illuminate complex subjects throughout, including some spectacular colour plates in one section.  Kaler deserves high praise for a comprehensive and exhaustive presentation untainted by weighty philosophy or arcane mathematics.<br />Kaler's uses the nearest star, our sun, to launch a comparative view of the more extreme versions of stellar objects.  Placed in the middle of the band of stars fitting on the &quot;main sequence&quot;, it's a valid starting point.  Main sequence stars range from very large and bright to very small and dim.  Within that range they follow fairly predictable patterns for a given size and type.  Outside that stable range, however, loom some immense exceptions and a plethora of tiny, almost minuscule stellar objects.  Orion's shoulder is marked by a star with a diameter nearly reaching the orbit of Jupiter.  Another, even greater, reach nearly to Saturn's.  Others, as Kaler notes, would &quot;fit inside a small town&quot;.  Even these minute objects have a life history that tells us much about the universe we inhabit.  Kaler is vivid in his descriptions of these objects, but he's even more spirited when dealing with the nuclear processes going on within them. Some stars truly seem to &quot;run amok&quot;!<br />Stars are distant laboratories where reactions occur impossible to  duplicate in Earth-bound facilities.  Kaler describes the activities of chemical elements within stellar objects and how their signals tell us about the events occurring there.  As stars burn away their hydrogen fuel, various options, some still not understood, may be followed.  Electrons jump from shell to shell emitting or absorbing energy.  These signals, he notes, are the indicators of luminosity, temperature and even distance.  One such signal, of course, is the most significant of all - the &quot;noise&quot; indicating the Big Bang that started it all.  One result, however, is clear - without these processes neither our planet nor we would exist.  This is because the stars, which began as clouds of hydrogen and dust, become the forges of heavier elements.  As Joni Mitchell once sang, &quot;we are all made of star stuff&quot;.

Although raised in a rural environment, his return to Sydney sparked some deeper insight.  When he began writing, it was to capture a picture of the city at its roots.  His books, an &quot;autobiographical&quot; series purporting to be written by travelling journalist &quot;Nino Culotta&quot;, have become Australian classics.  When this one was published, the novelty had faded, but O'Grady's style had lost nothing from the passage of time.  This book isn't to be compared to the earlier works by &quot;Nino&quot;, but is simply an extension of his adventures but in another milieu.<br />In this book he's retained the Nino identity.  Directed by his doctor to rest from the intensity of the building trade, he joins a mate, Shorty, fishing the river.  Fishing at night, the fisherman teaches Nino all the tricks from finding the fish to dealing with the authorities.  Nino, always a quick learner, becomes adept at the trade.  Nino meets other fishermen and Shorty's father, an irascible old codger.  O'Grady's portrayal of the Old Man is superb, while Shorty himself is a composite of several individuals.  Adding to the fun is the introduction of Nino's building trade mates to the fishermen.  Those knowing Joe and Dennis, Nino's builder friends will encounter a welcome and unexpected surprise at the end of this book.<br />O'Grady's books are classics for good reasons.  He's always observant, witty and informative.  While he's capturing a time and place in each account, there are reasons why his work will remain of interest for many years.  In part, because the narrative demonstrates vividly what the Australian language has lost with the introduction of American-dominated global communications.  His sense of humanity reaches beyond any limited locale in time or place and can find a welcome almost anywhere.  Nino's expressions of humble acceptance, particularly of things imparted by those more knowledgeable, strongly reflects O'Grady's own outlook.  It's an object lesson for us all.

Douglas' twist of a cat acting as a major character [although not the primary one as the \\"Midnight Louie [sic] Mystery\\" on the dust jacket implies] is handled with finesse.  The cat is observant, independent and adaptable.  Thankfully, \\"Louie\\" isn't over-anthropomorphised.  While instrumental, he isn't the primary sleuth you might expect.  Instead, Douglas uses her feline character to air some causes she's concerned about - in this case the threatened extinction of Kiwis [the birds, not the European \\"pakeha\\"] in New Zealand.  On the other hand, she plops some invective into the narrative against selected targets, of which more later.<br />There are some murders to keep the plot within the \\"mystery\\" genre, some of which are leftovers from previous books.  These tend to be added to keep your interest.  Will they be solved here or go on to further revival later in the series?  There is the usual rivalry of \\"cops\\" versus \\"private\\" sleuths, although none of the \\"private\\" characters are in the business.  Instead, one is a \\"public relations whiz\\", one a magician and one a former priest.  Douglas takes these three on a merry mazurka of personal relationships.  Only one of these characters seems to have a clear view of the assigned role.  Douglas has fun with her creations, but character development isn't her forte.  Even the repartee doesn't achieve the \\"clever\\" level that some mystery writers attain.  Perhaps this is Douglas' way of imparting realism.<br />The author's real strength is in descriptive prose.  She shines at that.  In this book there are many opportunities to show her stuff as it takes place around a \\"sci-fi\\" convention.  Although she correctly disparages the term \\"sci-fi\\", she seems unaware of Harlan Ellison's long-standing suggestion \\"SF\\" be rendered \\"Speculative Fiction\\".  Her knowledge of television and film SF is ample.  Characters relocated from their fictional realm into the convention's arena with aplomb.  Writers clash, roles are depicted and characterisations dissected.  For unexplained reasons, Douglas lashes out at Jeri Ryan's Seven of Nine character from Star Trek: Voyager.  The reason for her calumny seems focussed on the physical, which seems out of place in a \\"feminist\\" writer.  The repetition of her scurrility against this one character becomes boring, especially when she transfers it to one of her minor characters.<br />Usually, in such a series reading the first volume is mandatory, but that constraint doesn't seem to apply, here.  So much of this tale is interwoven with past events, one has the feeling reading the others would be repetitious.  This book, one of the latest, is a good introduction to Douglas.  The plot line is convoluted enough to satisfy the most demanding mystery buff.  The SF/fantasy environment allows Douglas to bring in \\"weird\\" characters who impinge but lightly on the story.  It's good beach/cottage reading material, but of limited scope and less interest.  The whole series would be a chore, unless you have an extended holiday.

Raised in the urban sprawl of Los Angeles, he was introduced to the wild, quickly finding excuses to return.  Paleontology is easily the best excuse available for travel and exploration.  He invites us to join him as he tours the North American West - into mountains, canyons and plateaus where fossils have emerged before.  From this familiar territory he goes on to more exotic sites.  His explorations reach from Andean highlands through Arabia deserts to the mysterious Mongolian plateaus.  It was the latter that gave Novacek the greatest rewards and kept him occupied for more than a decade.  This autobiography of a professional paleontologist provides interesting insights into the researchers depicting the prehistoric realm.<br />Before the rewards came the trials.  The first was the decision to take up paleontology when a music career dangled enticing rewards.  His father was a competent guitarist.  A chance to learn field work offered new opportunities and challenges.  Fresh creek water proved polluted leading to \\"highly volatile\\" digestive tracts.  In the Andes, Novecek's horse bolted with one boot caught in a stirrup.  Walking was impossible and riding little better.  Desert scorpions and rattlesnakes were added threats.  In Yemen, it was overzealous military staff.  The hazards of scrambling over cliff faces seeking fossil or fording rain-swollen rivers recede as serious threats and become part of daily expedition fare.<br />All these mishaps failed to quell his desire to travel.  The travel wasn't entertainment, but his quest for fossils.  The search wasn't always rewarding, but the promise or the need kept him going.  His misadventure in the Andes was off-set by a string of rewarding finds.  Glorious to behold and thrilling to experience, the Andes are now considered the fastest rising mountains in the world.  Fossils that had no business being at the altitudes Novacek's team encountered show how rapidly the mountains have been constructed by plate tectonics.<br />This mix of life experiences and scientific endeavour is richly enhanced by the graphics sprinkled through the text.  Some of the most interesting are diagrams of fossil assemblages as found in situ.  These provide a good indication of the complexities of retrieval and reassembly.  His maps are a bit spare, but give the general location of campsites and fossil finds.  Security, an issue of increasing concern in Mongolia, demands no more detail than necessary.  Some photos of the campsites themselves might have personalised the account.  His bibliography verges on the bizarre, being a mix of scholastic papers and general accounts.  Some of these are worth pursuing.  The knowledgeable will applaud his inclusion of John McPhee [although one volume is inexplicably omitted].

In this account of Humpback whales, their migrations, behaviour and biology, we are reminded of how close we came to eliminating them as a species.  The history of whaling in Australasian waters makes a dreary story, but Martin is very careful to avoid judgements in his account.  Only illegal whale hunting is subjected to critical comment, something almost universally deplored.  More cheering are his descriptions of whale biology, the magnificent journeys the humpbacks undertake from feeding to breeding grounds, the songs, and probably most significantly, the likely recovery of the diminished population.<br />With a firm, straightforward style, Martin traces the movements of whales in the Western Pacific and Eastern Indian Oceans.  From their Antarctic feeding grounds, the whales head north to the sub-tropics to breed.  After calving and a short period of social training of the offspring, the pods return south in waves of migration.  How long humans have been aware of their movements is unknown, but the colonization of this area by Europeans turned hunting from opportunistic to a dedicated commercial enterprise.  Truly organized hunting in this region wasn't common until the end of the 19th Century.  Once begun, the hunt become highly systematic.  Scientists began collecting migration information along with characteristics of the cetaceans for research reasons and in support of the hunt.  As their findings began to indicate unsustainable population levels, the calls for curbing the hunt began.  After a long campaign, protection programmes were introduced.<br />There are few villains in Martin's scenario.  The former Soviet Union reported far lower takes than they actually harvested.  One ship, the Olympic Challenger, became notorious for its illegal catches during the 1950s.  On the other hand, Martin's heroes are unequivocally identified.  William Dawbin from New Zealand went to great lengths to acquire as much information on the humpbacks.  His work became the foundation for further studies.  One follower was Graham Chittleborough who furthered Dawbin's work and contributing a wealth of his own.<br />Martin rejoices in the protection programmes leading to substantial recovery of humpback populations in recent years.  He states the recovery rate has achieved levels of 10% per year at the end of the last century.  He stresses that the techniques, alliances and cooperative efforts can be applied in other conservation areas.  The model, he notes, is effective and should be extended.  His account is enhanced by rough maps, graphics and photographs.  A fine bibliography, both popular accounts and scientific works.  A solid, readable summary of the humpback life story.

In Weir's long trail of redeeming the &quot;maligned&quot; monarchs of British history she has stumbled before.  In this case her pratfall is staggering.  Claiming Mary as &quot;the most wronged woman in history&quot; is so false on so many counts they don't bear extensive listing here.  Weir has given us less a history than a legal brief.  The evidence is either forgeries, polemics, or simply missing.  Weir interleaves the text with close examination of a multitude of documents in attempting to clear Mary's name of the charge of accessory to Darnley's demise.  By focussing on whether Mary, Queen of Scots, was instrumental in her husband's murder misses the point entirely.  Mary was queen of the Scots in name only - a legal contrivance for someone who never really ruled her native land.<br />Weir takes us over the events leading to the explosion in Edinburgh examining the lives and motives of the principals.  Cabals form and disband - the issues involved; land, religion and power, are only superficially covered.  Weir notes, for example the &quot;Auld Alliance&quot; of Scotland with France against England while avoiding the fear Scots Protestants had of liaison with Catholic France even against an old enemy.  She lists who's Catholic or Protestant, pro- or anti-Mary, active participant or dissembler, without providing any background to the individual's outlook.  To Weir, Mary stands as the pivot around which these forces swirl and engage.  Mary's fitness to rule is carefully avoided.  Only a dedicated monarchist could focus so narrowly in the face of the immense international and religious turmoil of the time.<br />Mary has been the subject of much hostile attention, nearly all of it deserved.  Married three times, with each match proving a disaster, the queen's life was permeated by one goal, to rule Scotland, and then Britain, by whatever means possible.  Her fourth effort at a match was so blatantly political it ultimately cost yet another life.  Her attempts to combine romance and politics provide Weir merely the opportunity to view Mary from a modern perspective, ignoring the impact of her actions.  Mary's &quot;cause&quot; embroiled several nations in a generation of conflict, but Weir is too concerned with clearing her name to notice.  She fails to note, for example, how Mary's co-regent, Elizabeth, kept her rule secure - by constantly referring to her people and how she loved them.  Mary, in Weir's view, scorned the Scottish population as crude and ignorant.  Hardly a strategy to earn support from someone who needed it so desperately.<br />Weir's advocacy may raise some further serious study of what resources remain.  Certainly this book fails in its avowed attempt to exonerate this &quot;wronged woman&quot;.  Even Weir accepts the disaffection Darnley engendered among the Lords of Scotland, while failing to note the parallel between Mary and Henry II.  Henry, like Mary, cried out to be rid of one who &quot;affronted&quot; the monarch.  Neither Henry nor Mary needed to be active participants in a murder to eliminate Thomas Becket or Lord Darnley.  They both knew there were loyal subjects willing and able to perform the feat.  That's what being a monarch can accomplish.  Weir's superficial account can be overlooked without regret.

Fortunately, Ackroyd essentially abandons the image as he progresses through this account of an urban &quot;life&quot;.  His narrative is lively and thorough - almost as dynamic as the city itself.  After a brief chronology of beginnings, he switches to a topical survey of elements contributing to the character of London.  Each segment may be local in time or place, or span distances and years.  We learn about the wall surrounding The City, the impact of noise - an ongoing phenomenon which repels some while attracting others - eateries, housing, plagues and fires.  There is a page and a quarter on suicides - although why that is set apart is elusive.  Ackroyd sets it all down like a Medieval annalist, surpassing that genre by carrying themes from origins to modern times.  The wealth of information presented is nearly overwhelming.  While the material is well organized, the steppingstone effect impairs the flow of narrative.  Perhaps, given the sweep of time and vast numbers of topics that can be derived from an urban history, light reading isn't possible.<br />Few are indifferent to cities - people seem to loathe them or love them.  Ackroyd is captivated by London, but he's anything but apologetic about the failings of urban living.  Crowding leads to disease.  Shoddy building practice encouraged conflagration.  Noise is universal through time and space.  Traffic jams long preceded the advent of the automobile and public transportation didn't prove a solution.  While there are those who revel in such an environment, as Ackyord admits, his own affinity for urban dynamics blinds him to an outsider's hostile view.  His most hilarious citation is that of Boswell's unfavourable comparison of Greenwich's weather that of Fleet Street!  He cites few critics, almost universally foreign, not rural Britons.  &quot;Country folk&quot; flocked to London: after the initial shock, smoothly fit in, continuing the urban dynamic he lauds.<br />The business of London, states Ackroyd, is business.  Development, restoration, exchanges of goods and services - including those involving such disparities as survival and entertainment - are what make London exist, even flourish.  Property is fundamental, as he demonstrates when fires devastate London. No plans or authority could match the speed with which owners reclaimed their shops and homes after the disasters.  Epidemics causing massive mortality only served to allow speculators fresh opportunities.  This, of course, is &quot;civilisation&quot; at work.  Almost invisible is the class structure this scenario creates, but Ackroyd aknowledges the &quot;ubiquitious shadow&quot; of the poor this situation creates.  Their numbers, he notes, &quot;could fully populate an average city&quot;.  This, in the &quot;greatest city in the world&quot;.<br />Fully aware of their condition, the London poor generated some of history's more radical political movements.  The initial year of the 14th Century witnessed uprisings of &quot;savages&quot; launching assaults on &quot;their betters&quot; - a tradition, Ackroyd notes, that is ongoing.  More organised &quot;movements&quot; from the Wat Tyler tax revolt through the Lollards and Chartists to today's race conflicts bear witness to class resentment and disaffection.  Urban dynamics, then, is not a wholly positive ideal.<br />Ackroyd has culled nearly every ingredient that goes into making a city.  In this case, it's London, but the same recipe could be applied nearly anywhere.  If London fogs incite more literature than Sydney's sunshine, that's a feature of latitude.  If Marx researched in London instead of Rome, that's an accident of history.  The urban stew Although Ackroyd's admiration of his city is clear and unequivocal, presented in a treasure of informative prose. If you are a fan of cities, especially Britain's capital, you may find this book useful, even entertaining.  He's a fine writer, assuming a monumental task.  He does it as well as can be expected.  He's given us a wearying tome, though hardly a boring one.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]ertaining.  He's a fine writer, assuming a monumental task.  He does it as well as can be expected.

Enigmatic and puzzling, the paucity of knowledge about them has resulted in a wide spectrum of interpretations.  Even today, the lack of information has allowed the rise of an extensive &quot;druidic&quot; movement, particularly in Great Britain.  Scouring through a wealth of resources and applying many years' work in this attempt to clarify the image of the Druids.  He applies solid resources,  assessing them rigidly and uses well the evidence has come to light.  He's keen to revoke commonly held views.  Druids weren't a savage priesthood practicing human sacrifice or arcane mysteries.  Instead, Ellis finds them the intellectual elite of the Celtic world.<br />In sweeping away false beliefs about the Celts and their Druid &quot;priesthood&quot;, Ellis provides a fine overview of Celtic society.  Instead of nomadic warriors, the Celts were generally pastoralists and farmers in a stable society.  Displacements and opportunitistic alliances resulted in societal changes.  From an egalitarian society in which leaders were democratically chosen, a hierarchical structure developed as a reaction to intrusions.  Christianity, of course, sounded the knell of their open society by demanding an end to &quot;pagan&quot; beliefs.  Once forced into this new role, the democratic society became patriarchal.<br />One major change he notes resulting from this change was the role of women.  Unlike their Mediterranean counterparts, Greece and Rome, the Celts held women in high regard, even granting them leadership status in peace and war.  How many women gained status in the Druidic elite remains unclear, but he asserts it was only logical that leadership would include intellectual capacity.<br />Inevitably, Ellis concludes with the &quot;revival&quot; of the Druid concept in modern times.  He sees many direct comparisons between the Celts and Hindu society as a modern example.  The &quot;caste&quot; system he finds in both societies underwent changes in their respective locales.  The mythology of a &quot;mystical Druid&quot; imagery was revived in Western Europe.  This image permeated thought among British intellectuals beginning in the 17th Century.  From a view of Celts and the Druids as savages, a new concept arose portraying them as &quot;keepers of wisdom&quot;.  Welsh, Cornish and Irish traditionalists enhanced this view leading to today's outlook of Druidism as a spiritual revival.<br />This thorough and insightful account of an unknown, but highly mythologised element of Western society is fundamental to an understanding of the Celts and their Druid sub-culture.  Ellis keeps the account lively and captivating.  Although his scholarship is thorough, it never overwhelms the reader.  It should remain an important work for some time.

They examine the aims and practices in these study areas through interviews and analysis of curricula.  The analysis is presented with a unique format - the authors couch their findings in the form of &quot;games&quot;.  Like all games, there are rules, playgrounds and players.  The players are the teachers and students, but the spectators are the readers of this book.  As taxpayers, the spectators often aren't aware of the game.  This book can go far in enlightening the audience.<br />The underlying theme is the dominance of activism over scholarship.  The authors note how activism by feminists in the 1960s and '70s led to the introduction of these special study areas.  More attention given to the role of women in society led to courses in women writers, artists and politicians.  Once in place in more university classrooms, Koertge and Patai show that the assault on &quot;traditional&quot; standards became even more widespread.  The authors open the book describing the IDPOL game - &quot;identity politics and ideological policiing&quot;.  Teachers and students alike place high emphasis on acceptable roles and see that these are enforced.  A major facet in establishing &quot;identity&quot; is the playing of TOTAL REJ - the eschewing of anything attributable to masculine origins.  Examples are traditional philosophy, mathematics, science and technology.  An extension of TOTAL REJ is BIODENIAL.  The latter game introduces &quot;social construction&quot; to Womens' Studies by asserting anything related to gender is culturally based.  This imported philosophical stance has been applied to wide areas in education, but impaired science and mathematics courses most severely according to the authors.<br />Fear of &quot;backlash&quot; reaction to the excesses of the programmes led the National Women's Studies Association to undertake a study.  Koertge and Patai are at their most scathin[g in assessing the report produced by the NWSA.  Virtually based on the book &quot;Women's Ways of Knowing&quot; that advocated a &quot;connectionist approach&quot; to learning.  Self-expression, urged the NWSA, is more valuable than study, research and writing skills - &quot;Empowerment over Epistemology&quot;.  Epistemology is traditional, hence, masculine, hence unaceptable as a foundation for learning in the university.  The authors offer a different solution.  They urge  the dimemberment of Women's Studies programmes by relocating the courses into the appropriate departments.  Game-playing and &quot;empowerment&quot; would be shed for more meaningful scholarship.<br />Almost lost in this study is its most frightening statement: &quot;feminist pedagogy . . . is being taken up by secondary and even elementary school educators and policy makers&quot; [p. 44].  They define &quot;academia&quot; has a site for scholarship and debate while bewailing erosion of these values by feminist dogma in their conclusion.  This dogma has emerged in the public school system [see C.H. Sommers' &quot;The War Against Boys&quot;] and shows little sign of abating.  Anyone interested should glance at the list of university &quot;Women's Studies&quot; programmes readily available on the InterNet.  The same courses, often taught by the same people, using the same curricula and reading material are still listed.  This realisation will keep this book useful for some time.

Anyone feeling the &quot;postmodernist&quot; assault on literature or philosophy has deteriorated will learn that science remains besieged by the cult of &quot;cultural relativism&quot;.  Each author provides a counterstrike against selected issues the &quot;pomos&quot; have launched to discredit science and/or scientists.  In brief, postmodern attacks on science are uniformly devoid of understanding how science works.  The critics of science distort history, fabricate or selectively edit texts and create meaningless issues.  The collection illuminates these practices, exposing a wealth of  poor scholarship and specious reasoning.<br />The writing quality in these selections is uniformly good, although some topics may prove difficult for readers unfamiliar with the material.  &quot;Superstring&quot; theory, for example, is perhaps the most arcane topic in physics, but Norman Levitt underscores its importance in a finely developed essay on the future of science.  Difficult subjects may cause some readers to avoid delving into this collection as being too remote.  Never fear - this anthology has urgent value for you.  To best understand why, you should read this series starting near the back.  Koertge's essay on the impact of postmodernism on education is more than a little frightening.  Koertge labels the application of &quot;pomo&quot; on education as &quot;Civilian Casualties&quot;, amply demonstrating why this book should receive wide readership.  She clearly demonstrates how far ideology attempts, and to some extent succeeds, in distorting the teaching of many fields such as mathematics.<br />While the essays cover a wide spectrum of topics, a recurring theme is the impact of &quot;feminist&quot; writers.  Feminist attacks on science hinge on the dominant role men have played in science in the past.  Instead of simply calling for more women to enter research fields, feminist ideologues blitz the entire scientific programme.  Koertge and the others here demonstrate that science and mathematics teaching is being politicised.  &quot;Feminist science&quot;, whatever that is, aims to revise fundamentally how science is done.  These essays confirm that ambition is misleading and destructive.  Yet, as the collection clearly shows, this objective has permeated North American education and media.  &quot;Ethnoscience&quot;, a derivative of the feminist ideology and purporting to supplant empirical science methods, is in ascendancy here and elsewhere.  Koertge and her colleagues examine and repudiate the underlying concepts of this movement.  A telling essay by Meera Nanda shows how postmodernist ideology has invaded the Third World in fomenting bad science in the name of ultra-nationalism and against a perceived &quot;neo-colonialism&quot; from the West.  Proponents of &quot;Islamic Science&quot; have openly adopted Western feminist writers in their tactics.<br />This book is a campaign document, but shouldn't be faulted for that.  It is, after all, responding to a crusade eroding three centuries of effort by dedicated researchers and thinkers.  Science is fundamental to our daily living, something its transparency leads us to forget.  These authors restore the respect science deserves.

Carey delays this admission until the end, although by then his feelings are clear.  Living and writing in New York City, only a deep inland residence could give him greater setting for contrast.  His comparison with his current home is limited to the cramped quarters he endures there.  Yet this limited contrast imparts the theme and import of this personal summary.  Little of this book is about Australia's key city.  Instead, the majority of Carey's essays here describe the Harbour, the Blue Mountains, the Pacific Coast, the Bridge and rivers.  The characters are a melange of his personal friends and historical figures.  There is a mystical episode on the Harbour Bridge and a passing critique of the CBD [Central Business District] and the values of those working there.  The theme remains that the City is but one location in a region of contrasts.  No other city is placed so uniquely.  Perhaps no-one is better suited to attempt this unique task.<br />Many cities rejoice in their history, but in this, too, Sydney is special.  Founded as a convict colony, it grew into a major Pacific port.  Survival was a struggle with poor soil, vagaries of rain and wind and the presence of the Aborigine population - issues that urbanisation hides but cannot eliminate.  Sensing its importance early, Sydney girted the Harbour with forts, something Carey lightly applauds when old forts become new parks.  Carey conveys the sense of struggle, but time has transformed equal starving of convicts and guards to ideals of social equality - so long as that society is white, he reminds us.  His &quot;distorted view&quot; imparts his dissenting view on relations with displaced Aborigines, among other topics.<br />However booksellers classify this work, it's not a travel advisory.  Tourists will be unlikely to join the Sydney to Hobart race.  Even more unlikely when they read Carey's account of the disaster of 1998.  Nor will the casual visitor find themselves in a capsized racing skiff in the teeth of ten metre waves and forty knot winds.  If you do visit, be careful hiking in mountains.  If your visit occurs in the Southern Hemispheric summer, be extra cautious with matches or campfires.  What can happen if you aren't Carey imparts with stunning clarity.  Having lost his own house to fire, a telephone dialogue with a friend fighting to save one is a gripping read.<br />Carey's many awards are well deserved.  His descriptive writing skills and characterisation are well demonstrated in this book.  It's no matter if these are real people, mixtures of many into one or wholly invented.  Their own stories are from real life and deserve attention.  Carey snags your attention from the first page and you give it willingly to the rest of the book.

Using his generalist background, he shows how anyone can appreciate what science can achieve and what it means to us all.  A feeling of &quot;being left out piqued his interest and he decided to seek out what he had missed.  His technique is one any of us can follow - his interest was piqued by the growing number of works for the general reader.  He didn't expect to become an &quot;expert player&quot;, but through these works could at least be &quot;at the game&quot;.<br />His study of fifteen key figures in science becomes a summation of what he garnered through reading and interviews.  Bragg's long journalism career gave him an entry key and many insights in dealing with the &quot;giants&quot; and their interpreters.  Having discovered several in this role, he has formulated a survey that will be valuable to many.  Using a technique combining the interview with the works of good writers, he's created a readable, cogent overview of what science is and what it means.  From Archimedes through Newton, Darwin and Curie to Watson and Crick you are given a variety of views of the key figures.  The importance of each is stated clearly, mixed with what is known of their characters and background.<br />In his conclusion, titled &quot;Where Are We Now?&quot;, Bragg makes an excellent summary of the impact of these seminal thinkers.  As an observer, he claims to have produced a &quot;map&quot; of scientific thinking.  The map is incomplete, but evokes an image of science as a &quot;human exercise intent on examining the meaning and purpose as much as the structure of life today&quot;.  It's a fine summary conclusion to his outstanding effort to help bring science to anyone wishing to learn its values.  The future, his interviewees stress, will be one of further, deeper discoveries.  His &quot;giants&quot; are in reality the ideas they developed, not in any way the scientists themselves.  From Newton's irascibility to Darwin's diffidence, all these figures retain a strongly variant human identity.  If nothing else, this book imparts the idea that science belongs to us all and can be furthered by anyone interested enough to undertake investigating unanswered questions.

For Pelagia Iannis the cost of transition is heavy.  Daughter of the village's widower doctor, she is caught up in global forces beyond her ken.  The imperial ambitions of Italy's dictator, Benito Mussolini, bring the Italian army of occupation.  Among the troops is Captain Antonio Corelli, artillery officer and musician.  An unwitting and hesitant imperial minion, he is billeted in the Iannis household.  Although the doctor urges passive resistance, Pelagia, although committed to a partisan youth, is drawn to Corelli's musical talents and unworldly charm.  De Bernieres weaves an intricate tale of love, war, humour and pathos with unrivaled skill.  His characters sparkle with realism, an aspect permeating this outstanding work.  His descriptions of the interactions of the differing nationalities and ideologies ring vividly true.<br />As he builds the story through the characters and events, de Bernieres gives little away.  There are continual surprises as events twist and bend the characters.  Some break, others find a means to extricate themselves from a tangling fate.  Pelagia bears the main burden throughout.  Her love for Corelli, after a fitful start, blossoms, then is tested by the swirl of events.  Other characters come into her life, remain or depart.  All make some impact as de Bernieres adroitly builds her role.  Each chapter becomes a minor tale in its own right, with all tied together flawlessly.  Characters and events are imparted with meticulous detail, yet, like a Mozart opera, not one word would bear excision.<br />If you like a story that successfully ranges over a variety of issues and people, you will seek far and wide to surpass this tale.  De Bernieres' skills in portraying life's complexities, yet maintaining reader attention and interest are peerless.

Their focus on Darwin's scientific achievements avoids slipping into the floundering depths of \\"cultural artefact\\" or psychological probings offered by some modern students.  The pair's straightforward account makes this book a fine initial starting point for those needing an introduction to Darwin's thinking and accomplishments.  As they point out firmly, there's much more to the great naturalist's work than simply \\"The Origin of Species\\".  They trace the fundamental ideas Darwin conceived in generating his various works, showing how some were related to Origin's thesis while others remained a naturalist's observations.  In particular, Darwin's long effort to understand the strange lifestyles of barnacles was the vehicle establishing his validity as a zoologist.  That status allowed him to express views on the more general workings of nature.  He was thus able to produce Origin from an accredited position.<br />White and Gribben assert that Darwin was but one of several scientists attempting to explain evolution's mechanism.  Albert Russell Wallace is, of course, the best known as the co-discoverer of natural selection.  Publisher Robert Chambers floated an anonymous proposal in 1844, to almost universal condemnation.  That book has been held as the greatest inhibitor to Darwin's publishing his thesis.  Yet, according to White and Gribbin, Darwin did publish his concept, scattered through a larger text and almost completely camouflaged.<br />After building the framework leading to Origin, the authors go on to present accounts of the debates following its publication.  There are good sketches of Darwin's defenders, Huxley and Hooker, as well as his opponents, Owen, Mivart and Sedgewick.  Darwin's problem of inheritance, which plagued him throughout the remainder of his life, is given skillfully.  That he [nor anyone else] had any inkling of Mendelian genetics didn't deter him from offering a scientific proposal based on then current knowledge.  The \\"great barrier\\" to universal acceptance of evolution remained, as it does among some today, was its application to humans.  Even his \\"co-founder\\" of natural selection, Albert Russell Wallace demurred at applying the idea to humans.  The issue was the human brain and the means of its expression, language.  The authors touch lightly on this subject, as did Darwin.  In the concluding chapters, however, White and Gribbin pay tribute to today's science of sociobiology in providing many answers to this seeming conundrum.<br />While not an \\"in-depth\\" study of Darwin, this work stands as a testimony to his originality and persistence.  The authors make good use of available sources, both primary and secondary.  They examine the opposition to evolution today, strenuously recommending Jonathon Weiner's \\"The Beak of the Finch\\" as a fitting explanation of how evolution works.  They rightly feel it is an important support of Darwin's idea.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]offering a scientific proposal based on then current knowledge.

Using evolutionary concepts to demonstrate the foundation of \\"belief\\" is not new, but Boyer surpasses all previous efforts.  He shows how all peoples have some reverence for spiritual entities, but these aren't necessarily \\"gods\\".  In most instances the veneration is more likely to be for departed ancestors as it is for some vague \\"divine\\" object.  Ancestor worship is widespread in today's societies as it was in Neolithic times.  Boyer accepts this universality as well as the intensity of feeling associated with the homage, whether for a vague spirit or identifiable individual.  Such universality, he proposes, must have evolutionary roots.  In his view those roots lie in our cognitive processes.<br />\\"Religion\\" is defined at the outset chiefly by casting away commonly-held definitions.  While some aspects of \\"religion\\" may deal with natural forces, mostly they are related to daily  human activities.  In Boyer's view, these forces are \\"projections of the human mind\\".  In nearly every instance, the \\"spirit\\" whether ancestor, deity or even a forest tree, exhibits human characteristics.  These are not always predictable.  In fact their very presence is predicated on spurious and unforeseen events.  The very unreality of their behaviour commands respect.  Our perception of their existence result from \\"inferences\\" stored in the mind from other experiences.  Although he views Western institutionalised religions as outside the norm of human society, the same basic pattern holds even there.  \\"Consolation\\", usually a form of release from death, for example, is almost absent from most religions.  Western monotheism is an exception from the human norm.<br />Boyer argues that the human mind has evolved in communities which have reinforced acceptance of supernatural entities.  He incorporates Richard Dawkins' \\"meme\\" concept to demonstrate how this process works.  Ideas about the supernatural are communicated to others as experiences, warnings or even behaviour norms.  Since so many facets of this acceptance relate to behaviour of individuals within the community, the feedback loop reinforces his view of the  evolutionary context.

Although many key figures appeared, few covered so many elements of this dynamic as did Alfred Russell Wallace.  From almost desparately poor beginnings, Wallace became a dedicated explorer and specimen collector.  Raby's sympathetic portrayal of this complex character is a good introduction.  Wallace travelled and collected far more widely than did his contemporary Charles Darwin.  That both developed the same concept, evolution of species by natural selection, was the result of keen powers of observation.  Wallace's wide-spread interests took his attention into areas Darwin either ignored or avoided.  Unlike the retiring Darwin, Wallace was at the forefront of many issues, speaking and writing on many issues.  Some of these, as Raby carefully recounts, led him into difficulties, both financial and intellectual.<br />Raby traces the development of a man who almost beggars analysis.  Wallace's life was dogged by near penury due to family commitments and lack of regular employment.  His decision to explore the upper Amazon basin was almost an act of desparation, but it led to a lifelong interest in nature and \\"primitive\\" people.  Overcoming the loss of four years of exploration and study, he recovered deftly with a long-term examination of the East Indies archipelago.  Early flirtations with socialist ideals gave him a more sympathetic view of indigenous people than the average Victorian Briton.  He adopted a strong sense of independence from authoritarian measures, leading him to oppose land enclosures and vaccination, which he saw as doing more harm than good.  The great issue in his later years was spiritualism.  This last proved a stumbling block to his scientific ambitions.  Although many authors disparage this interest as demeaning, in Raby's view it is simply another aspect of Wallace's probing intellect.<br />The primary concern with Wallace remains his co-authorship of evolution by natural selection.  Darwin's insight occupied his thinking for two decades while he considered evidence.  Wallace had been considering the issue for several years, finally synthesising his ideas during confinement from a malarial attack.  Wallace never disputed Darwin's priority nor his superiority as a scientific genius, although recent historians have taken up his \\"cause\\" in an attempt to erode Darwin's reputation.  Raby examines these claims in some detail, either refuting them or questioning the validity of the evidence.  Wallace diverged from Darwin's version of natural selection in some details, most notably over human evolution.  In line with his spiritualism, Wallace insisted the human mind could not be an adaptation and must be the result of influence by a \\"higher power\\".  He wasn't alone in that view either then or now.<br />Raby's examination of the life of another \\"tormented evolutionist\\" is an engaging read and fluent introduction to this charismatic figure.  With his long life encompassing an era of many new ideas, Wallace doesn't stand out in the history of science nearly as much as is his due.  This book goes far in restoring his image.  Raby's prose style is clear and expressive without descending into unnecessary adulation of his subject.  The greatest lack is in his failure to place Wallace more fully in the context of his times.  Since that would cover the whole of the Victorian era and beyond, we may forgive this curtailment.  There are, after all, numerous works providing that overview.  A valuable summary for the reader interested in exploration, natural science and Victorian personalities.

How can J.D. Salinger and Charles Dickens ever be compared?  Easily - they both write in the same language.  A few terms used today won't appear in Dickens' work, just as words common in the Victorian era have been abandoned.  The root language remains the same, but is in constant flux.  Ridley uses this metaphor to disabuse us of the ideas that either genes or environment are the sole drivers of our development.  Rather than separating those two elements, Ridley wants to integrate them.  From the literary metaphor, he moves on to a vivid overview of the latest finds in genetics and how environment can impact their operation.<br />Ridley's incomparable command of language is applied in explaining arcane concepts.  Ridley relates hard science with a touch of humour.  In avoiding jargon, he introduces catchphrases aiding explanation.  Instead of weaving scientific terminology into his descriptions, he provides unforgettable little terms to guide the reader.  Genes, he notes, are merely \\"cogs\\" in a complicated machine - the organism.  In explaining how these cogs interact to produce bodies and minds, he conceives the Genome Organizational Device [work out the acronym].  All these tools of Ridley's trade turn puzzling mechanisms into easily comprehended biological functions.<br />Of the many facets introduced by this book, Ridley's summation of the causes and impact of schizophrenia is the most informative.  Not long ago, he notes, \\"the gene\\" causing this disturbing affliction seemed to have been isolated.  Ridley wants to \\"throw the whole concept of 'cause' into confusion\\".  He devises a schema to present a string of \\"witnesses\\", each presenting a \\"position\\" on schizophrenia.  After historical, ideological and biological \\"testimony\\" is presented as individual views, Ridley concludes with a updated explanation for each.  Perhaps all the factors cited have impact in some way.  When brought together in an unfortunate individual, schizophrenia in one of its many forms is the result.<br />Ridley's aim is to end a war - a conflict he finds both misconceived and misdirected.  Peacemaking is not his aim.  Rather he wishes to integrate the two sides and initiate a fresh approach to a contrived problem.  Are genes or environment more important in driving how we behave?  Ridley eschews either and both in isolation.  His descriptions of gene interaction, using something he terms promoters, are shown to be both innate and relying on external signals.  He shows how researchers investigating genetic roots of behaviour are confronted with new examples of how genes perform their feats under direction from nature, and vice versa.  Ridley finds the combatants in the \\"nature versus nurture\\" wars are merely troops of the species Homo stramineous - \\"straw men\\".  It's to their mutual benefit to enter into a treaty written in his reasonable tone, based on updated knowledgeable and relying on his exhaustive portrayal of what's going on in our bodies.  As he states in conclusion, \\"even the fiercest warriors in this battle\\" have stumbled on the ideas he presents.  They have failed to reach a settlement, for which this book provides an unshakeable foundation. [stephen a. haines, Ottawa]some way.

An episode in Star Trek - The Next Generation portrays the Enterprise crew encountering a planet populated entirely by androgynes.  The cast representing these creatures is clearly composed of only women.  As clones, their appearance and outlook is nearly uniform and gender becomes a social ill.  If Steve Jones is correct, this condition is the future of the human species.  In this book Jones gives a full account of the rise and descent of masculinity, from the formation of the Y [male] chromosome to the current decline in sperm count in human society.  As Jones makes clear, we all start in the womb as neuters, but various processes dictated by the father's chromosomes, turn some of us into males.<br />Jones opens his account with a touch of irony - it was a woman, Nettie Stevens, who identified the male chromosome in 1905.  It took nearly a century to perceive the gene controlling sex determination - the SRY [sex recognition gene].  From there Jones explains the role of that short, 20 gene DNA string and its impact.  Embryo development relies on sperm-borne chemicals.  This input is part of the reason maleness drives the pace of evolution.  Sperm is an invader, and the body resists invaders.  The chemical changes reflect that fundamental dichotomy and there's nothing universal about male sperm.  Its variety reflects the rapid evolutionary pathways taken by various organisms.  And few species have evolved as rapidly as humans, Jones reminds us.<br />That haste, however, has led to vulnerability.  Male lines, particularly in our own species, die out quicker.  Jones' example is expressed in the recognition that all the family lineages since William the Conquerer had died out.  Nor are his examples confined to humans.  Hermaphroditic slugs in the French Pyranees are exhibiting an increase in female-only lines.  Given his evidence for this happening in modern men, one can only wonder at the cause of this unisex phenomenon.<br />For it's modern men that are the target of this book.  Whatever forces in evolution have reduced the size and impact of the Y chromosome, modern civilization has exacerbated its decline.  Clinics in various nations record reduced sperm counts, notably in Italian taxi drivers, American businessmen, Scots shopkeepers.  Jones isn't applauding these trends as some proto-feminist.  He wants, through this book, for males to become aware of the fate their descendents will confront.  Maleness is likely to disappear, and offers pointers to prevent that extinction.  More focus, he stresses, needs to be made on the impact of various foodstuffs and industrial chemicals.<br />Depressing as much of this sounds, there is much to be learned from this book.  Jones' ability to impart good science in a readable style makes this book an ideal acquisition.  While facts galore are presented here, pedantic stumbling blocks are not.  He has no more axe to grind than the desire to increase our awareness of ourselves, both male and female.  As he notes, understanding of the operations of sexual mechanisms is still in its infancy.  This book will stand for some time until more of our body's hidden secrets are revealed.  For we men, let us hope it's not too late. The recent announcement of the mapping of the Y chromosome renders Jones' forecast obsolete, but most of his data remains valid.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]this book.

Each match in this series explains how rivalries among scientists developed and what long-term effects the conflicts had for science and for the rest of us.  Some of these issues remain almost solely personality clashes, such as the priority question over calculus between Newton and Leibnitz.  Others, the choice of AC over DC for electrical power distribution and which nation would be the first to build a nuclear bomb, are meaningful to us all.  Offering brief descriptions of the issues and personalities, each of the essays is a good synopsis of the science.  The personality sketches are given with a strong emphasis on the contender's childhood where it can be derived.  Although the relevance of the childhood foundations seems contrived in most cases, the information provides a \\"human\\" background of people who often seem remote from us.<br />The  topics and personalities are so disparate that a general assessment is difficult, if not impossible for this work.  To his credit, White has focussed on fundamental questions and not been distracted by side issues.  He is at pains to be \\"fair\\", avoiding judgmental approaches and emphasising long-term impact of the conflict's resolution.  If the personality involved is too obtuse, stubborn or devious to withstand White's scrutiny, he makes it clear that the problem lies with that individual.  However, as he admits, he's not the only one doing the judging.  Aristotle's views of nature inexplicably dominated Western European thinking for two millennia because his proposed \\"four basic elements\\" could be merged with nearly any philosophy.  Only reason backed by empirical evidence would overcome this long tradition.<br /><br />The variety of topics forces some selectivity in evaluating White's effort, but one essay may be exemplary.  In describing the Monkeys and Men debate as a clash between Charles Darwin and Robert Owen, White stumbles badly.  There was little \\"rivalry\\" in this so-called debate, since Owen simply flatly refused to accept species \\"transmutation\\".  Since this concept was held by many educated people, Owen was already out of his time.  White notes Owen's strategy of remaining anonymous, but doesn't criticise it.  Since that was Darwin's chief objection to Owen, this is an amazing omission.  Darwin's real problem, natural selection applied to humanity, was the major stumbling block to universal acceptance to his concept.  White deals with that issue only in passing, and that incorrectly [Darwin mentioned \\"man and his beginnings\\" but once in Origin, not White's \\"few\\"].  He lauds Owen as England's \\"leading biologist\\", a questionable claim at best.  Yet in his description of the clashes between Owen and Huxley, he avoids their confrontation over the hippocampus in ape brains, in which Huxley demonstrated his superior research abilities in Owen's own field.  In dealing with Darwin's community of supporters, White mis-names Joseph Hooker as \\"John Hooker\\", even in the Index.  How a biographer of Darwin could make this gaffe remains an enigma.  Why, when Daniel C. Dennett has published the finest analysis of Darwin's Idea, White turns to an obscure work on science ideas for a quote from this eminent scholar is almost a greater mystery.<br />White's collection targets a few direct confrontations since the Enlightenment to show how important of science has become to us.  The \\"current wars\\", \\"reaching for the moon\\" and \\"the race for the prize\\" which revealed how DNA is structured [not \\"discovered\\" as White puts it] have impacted how meaningful science is to us.  Except for some terrible editorial sloppiness [\\"prevarication and \\"procrastination\\" are not synonyms] the book is a readable and important work in that regard.  White demonstrates how clashes over how natural forces work doesn't invalidate science.  Instead, it is the root of the scientific method - postulation, examination and refutation or acceptance.  He shows well the struggle science must engage in to reveal nature's secrets.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]stulation, examination and refutation or acceptance.

From tiny tarsiers to gargantuan gorillas, we are introduced to relatives familiar and forgotten.  Some are distant in both time and place, but they are all part of our bloodline - or genetic lineage - whichever you prefer.  As such, you should get acquainted and this is a fine introduction to the relationship.  Each group of our primate relatives is described and superbly illustrated.  Home range, diet and other characteristics are tabulated for each group.  Most importantly, the lifestyles and behaviour patterns given demonstrate how much we know and need to learn.  &quot;Acting like a monkey&quot; is a shopworn phrase that will be discarded by anyone reading this fine survey.<br />In describing primate evolutionary roots, the authors explain their importance to us.  Primates exhibit special characteristics.  Their arboreal living is almost unique among mammals.  They share binocular vision with predator species, even when they subsist on leaves, fruit or grass.  Meat-eating is not common among primates - our own roots suggest meat was but a minor part of our nutrition until recently.  Given the limited size of this book and the wealth of material covered, there are still a number of surprises.  Pictures of snow-covered Japanese macaques in warm mountain pools are commonplace today, but the authors suggest they learned this trick from tourists as recently as the 1960s!  Learning, it seems, is more widespread among apes than previously thought.  Chimpanzees &quot;teach&quot; others in their local group how to use tools.<br />Of all the traits Dunbar and Barrett describe, however, none is more enlightening than their summaries of primate behaviour.  Primates have a wide range of social structures, from wandering solitaries to various groupings.  Orang-utans are isolated by habit and habitat.  More familiar chimps, gorillas, baboons and many monkey species form groups of gender divisions - single or few males dominant to numbers of females selectively controlling male access.  Social arrangements lead to group activities of staggering variety.  The most significant practice, however, is grooming - the removal of dead skin and parasites.  Grooming takes up a significant proportion of time and is so meaningful in the social context as to be the most likely root of human speech.<br />Dunbar's comment in the &quot;Further Information&quot; section at the end summarizes the theme.  He cites Jane Goodall's &quot;In the Shadow of Man&quot; as &quot;the book that started it all . . . &quot;  Her studies of the Gombe chimpanzee community overthrew everything we thought we knew about apes and monkeys.  Primate research has made immense strides since that 1971 publication.  The authors have summarized the accomplishments and point to where more studies are required.  They point out the need for haste, however.  Many habitats are depleted and extinction awaits many species if steps aren't taken soon.

In line with many writers of the Australian scene, he deftly conveys his awareness of the Aborigine condition in this story.  Despite his name, Aljaz Cosini, born far away in Trieste, yet manages to return to his ancestral homeland.  Ancestral roots bear little, if any, sway on our monotheistic world.  In other cultures, however, forebears are the foundation for existence, a tradition widespread and of extended duration.  Flanagan's awareness of that cultural milieu is forcefully portrayed in this story of a man's final living moments.<br />Flanagan's method is subtle.  We mourn for the drowning guide as the story opens.  His fate is clearly inescapable.  Strangely, he condemns neither his situation nor the river that is taking his life.  The attitude is far from fatalism, however.  His circumstance is opening a new realm of Aljaz' awareness.  As he confronts the inevitable, Aljaz comes to perceive his ancestral roots.  Visions arrive of events he could not have witnessed, yet bear no skein of fabrication nor the supernatural either in Aljaz' mind or in Flanagan's depiction of them.  There are no deities or spirits here.  Aljaz resents that at first - \\"visions ought be given you by divine beings, not ... marsupials and their mates\\".  Yet these visions are events from the reality his ancestors experienced.  They are also of those real people -  his father, grandmother, and most importantly, his former girl friend and the child they lost.  Flanagan accepts the Aborigine view of children - love them intently, but if they are lost, long-term grief is too debilitating a luxury.  The white world didn't understand this view when they first encountered it, and it remains enigmatic even now.  Aljaz meets death calmly after a tormented life, but it's not release from suffering he gains, but a fuller understanding of who he really is.  He is joining with a lost heritage.<br />Describing Flanagan's style as \\"powerful\\" is frail praise.  \\"Formidable\\" might be something of a start.  This is not a book to rush through, or if done, one to turn back to again.  Flanagan wants to confront you with the realities of history and become aware of the long-term effects of lack of cultural awareness.  These aren't lessons acquired at one sitting.  He knows there are deeply set roots underlying behaviour and this book is attempt to reveal some of these to us.  He has accomplished this effort with vivid imagery and exemplary characterisation.

Bryson possesses all three in surpassing quantity.  He's brought them all to bear in this impressive work.  He adds a strong dose of enthusiasm to his account.  This additional element from a man previously rarely exhibiting a feeling for science imparts in this book a sense of his awe at what research has achieved in recent years.  While his awe sometimes leads him to abundant superlatives, we can forgive his exuberance as an expression of discovery.  He wants us to share both his wonder and his realisation that science is comprehensible.  We must respect his objective, since it's important in our lives.<br />After a string of entertaining but mildly useful travel books, Bryson offers the grandest tour of all - a journey from the beginning of time.  His \\"In A Sunburnt Country\\" gives an account of his visit to Shark Bay in Western Australia.  His awe at being in the presence of ancient stromatilites is reflected in his portrayal of life's history.  Opening Part V, with the observation that \\"it isn't easy being an organism\\" he summarises what conditions must prevail to allow life to come into being and survive.  Those stromatilites poisoned the atmosphere for early life forms, he reminds us.  Only a special few survived to evolve to become us.  We often think of ourselves as \\"carbon-based\\" life.  Bryson suggests counting any 200 atoms in your body - only 19 of them will be carbon.<br />Bryson tracks the threats life has confronted and survived.  Deep-sea pressure, intense heat - some creatures can't survive unless it's hotter than we can tolerate - and the vagaries of climate and topography.  A wandering planetary orbit incites an ice age that nearly eliminates life.  A wandering asteroid annuls a multi-million year reptilian global empire.  Two continents, long separated, join through a narrow isthmus of land.  The resulting change in ocean currents dried Africa, shrinking its forests and leading an ape to become bipedal and brainy.  All of which led to the creature that wrote this book - and others reading it.  And both creatures, along with all others, must survive on the 0.036 per cent of fresh water available to us.  The remainder, except for a few tenuous clouds, is locked up in ice.<br /><br />If Bryson's travel books reassure us about places we might visit, this book reassures us that science, although demanding and seemingly mysterious, is accessible to us.  This is a fine place to start.  He's interviewed many scientists and read widely.  His excellent bibliography at the end reflects his efforts and the state of various fields of science.  It is wonderfully up-to-date.  The Index, on the other hand, needs some serious attention.

Distant, remote, mysterious, it has been the subject of speculation, invention, misconception and investigation.  Mars has provoked almost as much interest as our moon.  Morton traces the early views of what this distant planet might represent and how a generation of human probing has revealed.  It's a world of extremes, he declares.  The highest mountains in the solar system.  Immense chasms that might indicate massive water flows or something else not found in earthly canyons.  The atmosphere is thin and cold, but can sustain global dust storms.  In short, everything we learn about Mars raises more questions than provides answers.  The world on his wall is one of several attempts to map this remote place and characterise it.  Morton's account is informative and compelling as he presents what we have learned and the people who have provided the information.<br />Morton shows how the struggle to understand Mars is faced with limitations.  The usual path of comparison with features on Earth prove feeble and vague.  Antarctica is one model, the Hawaiian volcanoes another.  Neither fits sufficiently to provide valid comparisons.  Mars, he urges, must be understood within its own framework.  That implies the picture must be built up from a fresh foundation.  The foundation has only been sketched by the various probes sent to Mars during the past generation.  The interpreters of data transmitted from fly-by probes, landers and surface rovers are the heroes of Morton's account.<br />Mapping Mars had its origins in Berlin in 1830 when two astronomers sought to establish the length of the Martian day.  The 1877 &quot;opposition&quot; led to Schiaparelli's establishing the first nomenclature of visible features, including the famous &quot;canali&quot;, misperceived by American Percival Lowell as &quot;canals&quot;.  When NASA sent the Mariners to Mars, it was Merton Davies who initiated the first true mapping efforts.  Morton vividly describes the difficulties in translating fly-by images into realistic representations of the Martian surface.  One example of the task is the eight-hour long process needed to transmit a single image the Mariner probe produced back to NASA.  Morton then introduces the artists who produced the first graphic drawings made from these early images.<br />New tools offered additional information, allowing the artist to refine their work.  Laser pictures combined with radar mapping added fresh details.  The maps improved, and with them, the analysis of how Mars is constructed.  The discovery of Martian magnetism offered both insights and challenges.  Fresh ideas of Mars' internal structure and process had to be developed.  Visible ice, long conceived as frozen carbon dioxide, had to be reassessed.  Is there water on Mars, and what has been its role?<br />Unlike most science writers, Morton gives strong place to the speculative in considering Mars.  He laces the story of science with the world of fiction.  New information has transformed the writing of speculative fiction and the presentation of &quot;space art&quot; in depicting the planet and its features.  He is an enthusiast for these efforts, imparting the struggle novelists and artists have had in &quot;getting it right&quot;.  They are to be commended for their efforts as Morton is in introducing them to us.<br />The water issue raises important questions about future, manned, missions to the planet Morton examines the possibilities within a clear explanation of what is plausible.  He accepts that manned missions are inevitable, but can only be accomplished from a knowledgeable basis.  The ultimate question, can Mars be &quot;terraformed&quot; to permit &quot;normal&quot; habitation by Earthlings, is also evaluated.  Will such an effort come from a planet-wide consortium of nations?

The term \\"polemic\\" doesn't appear in his.  He doesn't engage in polemics, and pours balm on those that occur.  The \\"war between science and religion\\" is something he deplores.  His subtitle sets the tone of this book in describing \\"The Relationship Between Science and Religion\\", deftly eschewing conflict at the outset.  In reconciling the discipline of science with the dedication of faith, Ruse follows the labyrinthine path of Christian teachings.  His Quaker upbringing and background in the history of science has prepared him well for this torturous task.  His sense of wit allows him to achieve this without becoming ensnared in arcane theological questions or sectarian strife.  Few, if any scholars have accomplished this level of detachment with such charming style.<br />Ruse establishes his credentials promptly, offering a succinct account of \\"Darwinism\\" [a term i loathe].  He explains the history and mechanisms of evolution by natural selection with aplomb.  The book is valuable for this summation, if nothing else.  He explains various forms of evidence such as the similarity of animal body structures [homology].  He continues with various dialogues between Christians who view evolution as a threat to morals, society, ethics and the other tired arguments and why they have no basis.<br />Finally, Ruse states the obvious: many scientists are and have been, successfully practicing Christians.  Whether or not they've made the effort to rationalise this disparity, he saves them the effort in examining how the reconciliation can be achieved.  For centuries, he reminds us, the study of Nature was in order to glorify a deity.  He uses Augustine frequently in support of the view that Nature deserves serious study.  Ruse calls this \\"the Augustinian option\\", that Christianity has no room for the ignorant.  Nature's wonders and laws follow a divine plan, which must be recognized and respected.  Science then, is not an enemy, but rather an ally.<br />Ruse concludes with a firm \\"Absolutely!\\" to the book's title.  He warns of the difficulties: one must choose from among the various Christian ethics and values, recognize that not all questions have been answered nor all issues resolved, be prepared for some in-depth study.  The path is difficult, but having been traversed by some, others may follow.  Given the nature of the topic, Ruse has performed an outstanding service in addressing this complex question with such finesse and clarity.

Classical philosophers seemed so self-focussed that attempts to translate them into a global human framework proved futile.  This essay collection reinforces that image admirably.  As &quot;Lives&quot;, each essay offers a pithy biography of his subjects with references to recent studies of their work.  It's not quite accurate to label this collection book reviews - for starters you must go the Index to retrieve the titles.  A &quot;collection of observations&quot; seems more accurate, since there's no common theme nor particular view endorsed.  He ranges from Plutarch to David Stove [who?] with pauses in the 17th and 18th Centuries.  Kimball's focus on classical philosophers allows him to steadfastly ignore the many advances made in cognitive science over the past generation.  This severely limits his views and our enjoyment of an otherwise lively series.<br />In dealing with his subjects, Kimball places strong emphasis on their capacity for expression.  The sole graphic artist in the collection, Daumier, is extolled for his vivid caricatures, providing an interesting comparison with Wodehouse in that Kimball sees them both as &quot;timeless&quot;.  Whether any of the philosophers fall into that descriptive is left for the reader to determine.  Philosophy, which purports to deal with &quot;universals&quot;, isn't granted that capacity here - the subjects being entirely Western European [and its colonies].  Kimball's entertaining style diverts us from that narrow outlook.  Still, if he is dealing with &quot;the Mind&quot; it might do well to reach a bit further than he has in this collection.<br />While the essays provide Kimball opportunity to take of few swipes at things he finds distasteful, such as rock music and &quot;political correctness&quot;, his reach sometimes leads him to stumble.  In resurrecting the Australian philosopher and social critic David Stove, Kimball launches into a diatribe against Darwin's natural selection being applied to humans.  &quot;Darwin's Dangerous Idea&quot; has long been viewed askance by philosophers for a variety of reasons.  Kimball, using Stove, exhibits this abhorrence vividly, launching an assault on Richard Dawkins' &quot;selfish gene&quot; concept while ignoring the power of memes as cultural transmitters.  In his tirade, he displays Stove's lack of understanding of natural selection.  In Stove's case, there might be some excuse - for Kimball it demonstrates his ignorance of a generation's research.<br />Most of Kimball's commentary may be forgiven in a man with a classical outlook.  One paean stands out for remarkable shortsightedness, however.  In his essay on Santayana, he declares as &quot;eloquantly said&quot; the philosopher's assessment of British Imperialism:  &quot;Never since the heroic days of Greece has the world had such a sweet, just, boyish master&quot;!  This of a people who foisted smallpox-infected blankets to Native Americans, expanded the harshness of human slavery beyond anything the ancient world would have condoned and declared an entire continent &quot;devoid of humans&quot; as the rationale for its occupation and conquest.  Hardly &quot;sweet&quot; or &quot;just&quot;.<br />Classical European philosophers struggled mightily to understand the human mind.  Kimball's chosen representatives of that effort exhibit the intensity they endured in their striving.  Descartes chose &quot;dualism&quot; - an idea that persisted for three centuries.  Kimball's presentation shows the concept isn't yet fully cast away.  He &quot;doesn't admire&quot; Hegel, but we remain unclear whether it's the philosophy or the man.  Bertrand Russell is &quot;a brilliant, tortured enigma&quot; struggling to merge technical competence with social causes.  With Wittgenstein, however, we see the futility philosophy endured.  Kimball cites him as agonizing over his realisation that  &quot;the unsayable alone has genuine value&quot; - thus empirical knowledge cast into the philosophical dustbin.<br />Kimball's collection is a comprehensive glimpse into the lives and works of noted and forgotten figures in philosophy and the arts.  He deals well with what he knows, but his errors are glaring.  His style is deceptively readable, but the reader is cautioned that there is little of substance here.  Read him, then go to the works he reviews, thence to the originals.  Keep in mind that cognitive science is rapidly widening the view we have of the mind and its workings.  There is much to be learned and dwelling on classical speculations is turning away from what needs to be done.

Reading Brown's analysis on the one hand and the daily news on the other shows how mistaken this view is.  This is a refreshing and perceptive examination of the topics encountered over education, workplace behaviour, health and environmental issues.  In short, Brown asks what the role of science is in our lives and how should we consider it?  While the so-called &quot;science wars&quot; may seem like a remote philosophical debate, Brown brings it home for us all.  In his view, you, as a participant in society, have a role to play in what science ought to address.  He is adamant, however, that how science is done should remain with those who understand the methods involved in seeking the truth, elusive as that concept might be.<br />Brown's reviews the famous &quot;Sokal Hoax&quot; in which a physicist scathingly exposed the limits of &quot;postmodern&quot; language and philosophy.  He explains how the Sokal Affair raised the public consciousness about views of what science is and how it works.  Brown presents and illuminates the issues with admirable clarity and logic.  He is a Professor of Philosophy with a deep respect for rational thinking.  Unlike some, he doesn't view &quot;cultural relativism&quot; as a fad.  Instead, he's aware of its impact in education and the wider world of social and political life.  We are daily confronted with decisions to be made.  We must make them on a rational basis and not be misled by &quot;charlatans&quot; who would obfuscate the issues.  We make decisions on the basis of the values we hold.  Brown enjoins us to be clear on our values - their foundations and how they are derived.  This all sounds familiar, even redundant.  Brown demonstrates how easily we can be misled if we fail to pay attention to what we are encouraged to believe and how we act on those beliefs.<br />Brown's answer to the query in his title seems simplistic - you do.  You should rule science through democracy.  We all believe in democracy [at least most of us reading this book do] and we all feel we know what it means.  Brown wants you to reconsider what you believe about democracy and how it should be practiced.  In short, he understands that in our form of democracy, knowledge, not emotion or mythology, should rule.  Brown demonstrates how &quot;expertise&quot; already plays a significant role in political decisions.  Expertise is derived by those who employ scientific methods to increase our knowledge.  Our job is to sort through differing views to determine which is most applicable to issues under consideration.  He recognizes the difficulty of the task, offering step-by-step solutions to ease the burden.  People need to hear &quot;more intelligent and informed voices&quot; in Brown's view.

They range from  divine gift to something derived from hunting gestures.  With no fossil evidence available, all are speculative and defensible only by logical derivation.  Dunbar has offered the most likely scenario for human language.  Using persuasive evolutionary roots, tied securely to observed practices of our primate cousins, he builds a coherent picture.  While the foundation rests on primate grooming practices, Dunbar shows how this activity led humans developing social interactions to become language.  Because we, alone among the primates, also evolved the necessary physical equipment for speech, we are the ones who produced complex languages.  Dunbar's account is presented in lively style, showing his own language skills to the full.<br />It may seem a twisted path from scratching in your neighbour's fur to the complexities of human speech, but Dunbar clearly shows us how evolution traversed it.  Part of the story lies in our adapting an upright stance and bipedal locomotion.  The enlarged human brain, already given a boost by primates having a proportionally larger brain than other animals, also contributed.  Our needs drove us to greater mobility leaving less time for interactive grooming.  The brain's demand for resources turned grooming into a waste of valuable food gathering time. Speech was the means of retaining contact and the grooming habit was lost.  The most important food gathering wasn't the hunt for meat, but the gathering of vegetables.  Meat supplied only a small portion of the nutritional bulk compared to the vegetables garnered by the community's females.  From this reality, Dunbar proposes speech developed more rapidly in females than in males.<br />Dunbar's analysis doesn't stop at the edge of the African forest, but probes into parties, pub conversations and business meetings.  No facet of human verbal communication has been overlooked in this survey of our speech habits.  One element of our social structure lies in the size of our personal &quot;communities&quot;.  Research shows that primate communities share a viable group size of about 150 individuals.  Whatever your living circumstances, a careful count will show you probably interact closely with no more than that many other people.  Dunbar shows that even in the urban environment, this figure holds.  It isn't the number of neighbours we have, but how many people we communicate with personally.  This figure derives from deep primate evolutionary conditions in which 150 was the likely group size in which we could develop effective social skills.  &quot;Gossip&quot;, in Dunbar's view is simply a synonym for social communication.  We talk more about people than we do about philosophy - or anthropology.<br />In conclusion, Dunbar views the current communication environment with some caution.  He notes that the rise of electronic communication hasn't replaced the practices we developed on the African savanna.  All the promises of closer ties with distant people don't seem to have brought us together.  He notes that e-mail and &quot;chat rooms&quot; are rife with rage and hate messages.  People insult one another with the impunity of distance.  Our verbal communication is still limited to that 150 member-sized group.  Dunbar vividly shows how old ideas of human evolution must be seriously reconsidered.  We can't reconstruct the steps of evolution, but we can investigate the possible scenarios to draw the most logical conclusions.  Dunbar does this with wit and fine scholarship.  It's a thorough and effective analysis deserving close attention.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]r speech habits.

Scarre has managed to create one, and it's an admirable job.  Sifting a wealth of research, he's produced a string of vignettes depicting archaeological sites available to visitors.  He reminds us throughout the book that we have learned a great deal about our ancestors, but there's still much to be achieved.  Some sites have room for volunteers to assist in the recovery of buildings, religious centres and graves.  It's a thought to keep in mind as you go through the photos and text he's provided for guidance.  If you can afford to buy this book, you can probably afford visiting at least one of the locations.<br />Scarre's opening is also unique in that a location map is provided in the end papers with a chronological chart running along the bottom.  If you have an interest in a particular time period, you can determine which sites are represented.  On the other hand, if you want to visit a particular site, you can determine where it stands in the course of history.  It's an effective beginning for this special book.  Reading this book should be incentive enough to visit one or more of the sites.  The maps show both the layout of the find and its relationship to the surrounding area.  The photography is exquisite, complemented by numerous useful diagrams.  A short &quot;Further Reading and &quot;Further Viewing<br />Each reader must make their own priorities in choosing preferred sites to visit.  For me, two stand out - Avebury in southern Britain [Chapter 6] and the long stone avenues of Carnac in southern Brittany [Chapter 4].  Avebury and Carnac overlap slightly in the chronology, and scholars debate on Brittany's influence on megalithic monuments in the British Isles.  Both sites cover an immense amount of landscape.

Gould: Survival of the Fittest (Revolutions in Science)	Books	5	24	27	N	N	A pacifier from the Pacific	Kim Sterelny's overview of the Stephen Gould - Richard Dawkins conflicting views of evolution is a masterful summation.  Setting himself an immense task, he addresses the material published by the two evolutionists, assessing evidence, logic and interpretation.  To Sterelny's lasting credit, personality is almost entirely omitted in this account.  A brief education background note [Dawkins studied under Tinbergen, Gould's mentor was George Gaylord Simpson] and Sterelny moves quickly to the essence of the debate.  His presentation makes this a fine introduction to the issues involved.<br />Debate is a gentle word to apply to some of the acrimonious exchanges the pair engaged in either directly or through proxies.  The opening shot was Gould's scornful review of Daniel C. Dennett's \\"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\\" in which Dennett challenged Gould and Eldredge's notion of punctuated equilibrium as setting the pace of evolution.  The clash brought to light more fundamental differences in outlook - gene-centred evolution or a multi-level interacting set of forces.  As Sterelny ultimately points out, the two are subject to merging into a broader synthesis.  Dawkins has made that point frequently, as Sterelny notes, but that reality failed to find fertile ground on this side of the Atlantic.<br />Gene-centred evolution results in the creation of adaptations through mutations.  Whether  these adaptations are successful over time is the story of evolution.  Gould found many ways to challenge this theme, chiefly because it would apply equally to human evolution, something Gould always found abhorrent.  Gould's argument went deeper than human evolution.  He advanced \\"contingency\\" and mass extinctions of whatever cause, as more viable mechanisms than what he labelled \\"gene centrism\\".  Sterelny presents both positions with admirable clarity and laudable equilibrium.  It would be churlish to criticise Sterelny's temperate treatment of Gould's notions.  Dawkins and Dennett have already performed the task sufficiently, although Sterelny skirts Dennett's examination.<br />The loss of Gould to cancer has not quelled the debate, thus proving it wasn't simply a clash of personalities.  A Gould \\"camp\\", with adherents on both sides of the Atlantic, maintains the heated dispute.  Lewontin and Kamin in America and the Rose cabal in the UK still launch verbal missiles at the Dawkins target.  Sterelny keeps his focus tight in this book, not being diverted to these disputants.  In performing this feat, Sterelny might be criticised for failing to note why the debate is worth notice by a wider audience.  He certainly hasn't written this for the academic community, although many in other disciplines might benefit from his insights and brisk narrative.  Sterelny's position as a philosopher located in New Zealand is sufficient example to show how far the debate has reached.  Its very universality might have prompted him to reflect on its impact on social questions.  Even so, his effort is highly commendable and deserves the widest possible readership.

Between these two admonitions, Barbara Strauch vividly relates how old ideas of brain development have been overthrown by recent research.  Her judgement of \\"recent\\" is expressed with the dismissive comment that any source found prior to 1996 was \\"too old\\".  She thus adds another brick to the edifice being constructed in cognitive sciences.  The studies have gone beyond research in human cognitive studies to include other primates - chimpanzees and monkeys in demonstrating the roots of human behaviour.  These findings are providing a wealth of new insights into our evolutionary roots.  Strauch has contributed much in our knowledge of who we are in the animal kingdom.  Although the studies are new, and further research is necessary, Strauch explains the patterns that are emerging.  Further work can only provide more enlightenment.<br />Although her research covers many fields and countless workers, the key source is Jay Giedd.  Giedd was prompted by data showing how adolescent brains exhibited unexpected changes.  \\"Gray matter\\", that term we so often blithely use to indicate the brain and mind, was expanding in teens.  It actually grows beyond that of the average adult, then \\"dramatically thinning down\\" some time later.  This find suggested many changes are occurring in teen brains - making them, in Strauch's estimate, \\"a bit crazy . . . but crazy by design\\".  She reminds us throughout the book that while teenagers may appear physically mature in stature, what is going on in their brains is unfinished.  They may look like us, but their behaviour is generally radically different.  Incomplete brain development is the root cause of these departures from what we consider \\"normal\\".  It was Giedd's research that sought to provide a baseline of what is \\"normal\\" for our children in those tumultuous years.<br />With the wide-ranging sources she uses, Strauch takes us through all the problems parents face in trying to comprehend the vagaries of teen behaviour.  Sex, bizarre sleeping patterns, drugs and alcohol use by teens all have come under new scrutiny by various research teams.  They stress the vulnerability of the teen brain to nicotine, alcohol and other toxins.

Some hope to gain notoriety by toppling such an icon.  &quot;Post-modernists&quot; apply the &quot;cultural artefact&quot; dodge - natural selection could only arise in Victorian Britain.  Still others have observed the complexities of today's life forms, and unable to comprehend how the process of natural selection brought them about, lash out in frustration.  Gabriel Dover seems to fall in the latter category with this bizarre work, although an undercurrent of self-promotion is evident.<br />The book is an attempt to promote Dover's concept of &quot;molecular drive&quot; he introduced some years ago.  In Dover's view, the complexities of today's chromosomes can be projected backward in time to explain evolution's mechanisms.  Molecular drive is so powerful and far-reaching that it exceeds natural selection's gradual pace.  Since this complexity can arise in nearly every life form above the single-cell organism, natural selection is thereby refuted, Dover says.  He attempts to explain the mechanism with convoluted examples of fruit flies suffering from a rare, but deleterious mutation.  By the time he's finished we are left with little understanding of how this process evolved, but even less of how it replaces natural selection.<br />Whiffs of Behe Syndrome permeate this book.  BS is an affliction infecting those dazzled by the intricacies of modern genetics.  Sufferers are unable to perceive the long reach of natural selection through time.  Hence, they tend to maneuver around it, grasping at any straw in searching for quick, immediate answers to evolution's mysteries.  Dover's &quot;molecular coevolution&quot; is an attempt to graft one of these answers to Darwin's original thesis.  Like other examples of BS, it fails pitifully.  Darwin's Idea survives this attempt at erosion with renewed strength.<br />The ethics of invoking the shade of Charles Darwin to inform us of advances in genetics are questionable at best.  Darwin has been &quot;updated&quot; before, although none with the aim of degrading others.  Dover presents his case in a series of letters, some attempting to explain modern molecular biology, some just &quot;chatty&quot;.  The shadow of Darwin is astoundingly tolerant of all this.  Dover makes him out as appreciative of the update effort, but anyone who has read Darwin isn't deceived.  Darwin was too clear a thinker to be misled by such devious tactics.  Dover's inept handling of Darwin glares from every exchange.  The many personal asides appear to be some form of camouflage to distract the reader from perceiving how ineptly Dover handles the issues.  The barbed assault on Richard Dawkins sprinkled throughout the book proves even worse.  Dover's recruiting Darwin's ghost as an ally in this venture is the final flaw.

The authors of this book represent a prime example of the validity of Stephen Gould's lament.  It may seem an oversimplification of the authors' theme to call it \\"neurotheology\\" or \\"hardwired for gods\\", but their case is so overstated that perhaps a balance is thereby achieved.  Relying on Buddhist meditators and praying nuns, the authors recorded brain activity states to compare with \\"normal\\" conditions.  They then go on to link various areas and functions of the brain to demonstrate that religion is an evolutionary product.  For the prurient reader, they contend that the transcendental feelings we obtain from sex links through the limbic system to other parts of the brain becoming the foundation for \\"religious experience\\".  Freud would have loved this book.<br />The authors map the brain/mind to build a framework to explain the universality of religion.  Their outlook is almost entirely from Western Civilization - even the Buddhist meditators are American.  From this flimsy foundation and the contributions of some Western philosophers, the authors go on to construct their edifice.  The brain, they argue, is designed as a \\"window to [g]od\\" which they rename the Absolute Unitary Being.  They contend that gods are not the product of a cognitive, deductive process, but were instead \\"discovered\\" in a mystical or spiritual encounter.  Shoring up their structure with numerous spurious assertions of the brains' processes, they see this capability having been designed through evolution.  Not since the concept of \\"the Great Chain of Being\\" have humans been granted such a glorious role.  GCoB exalted reasoning as giving humans \\"superiority\\" over the rest of the animal kingdom - telepathy to the divine was a step too far.<br />Many fine books reflecting recent brain research have been published in recent years.  While their descriptions of brain processes make vivid reading, there are far better sources available on the topic.  The authors cite a few and ignore the rest.  The ones they cite utilise information with adroit selectivity.  In fact, most of their sources have been chosen with finesse.  A glaring omission is Walter Burkert's Creation of the Sacred.  Whatever Burkert's flaws he, at least, makes a serious attempt to extract valid evolutionary roots for religious ideas.  Newberg and D'Aquili begin with the premise that there is a god [one, please note] and then manipulate neurological research to \\"discover\\" it.  Like Burkert, this pair ignores the power of memes to propagate ideas and stimulate response behaviour, a major element in the dissemination of religious thought, but Richard Dawkins is ignored in this book at any level.  It's interesting that after pages of \\"neurotheology\\" explaining how the brain is there to communicate with a god, at the end they waffle over its actual existence.<br />Although the flaws in the authors' logic are immeasurable, their frequent references to human evolution display even more glaring faults.  They assert that Australapithicines likely  didn't have sufficient brain power to invoke deities, but grant this level of intellect to Homo erectus.  They assert H. erectus was the first to have a mind capable of considering \\"existential dread\\", but unable to perceive their deity.  Not until H. Neanderthalis did the concept of deities arise, which they claim is evidenced by ritual burials.  Ritual burial and deities are linked in today's world, but there isn't a shred of evidence to suggest this is the way of Neanderthal thought.  Nor is there any reason to believe that \\"dread\\" alone was the prime mover in considering the natural world.  Benefits were clearly available - successful hunts, available fruits and vegetables, water - were these not also granted divine status?  Their theme, rife with inconsistencies, keeps the deity at arm's length until a hominid evolved to talk to It.  That presupposes 3.6 billion years of their god waiting in limbo.  Divine patience, indeed!  And if the Chixculub asteroid had missed the Earth, who would the AUB communicate with today?

With an exhaustive overview of the geologic and evolutionary history of our planet, Strahler vigorously rebuts a multitude of Christian creationist assertions.  Strahler takes some effort to expose the faulty logic, poor science and devious methods Christians have used to impair the public's perception of evolution.  The author is able to fully detail each creationist assertion and how science refutes them.  If there is a pivot point in this presentation, it would be the spurious &quot;human&quot; tracks &quot;found&quot; in a Texas riverbed.  Many facets - the age of the earth, the path of evolution and the role of analysis - are exemplified by the circumstances surrounding this artefact.<br />While Strahler leaves no doubt over his view of Christian creationists, he provides such a wealth of their material that the book might well be considered &quot;balanced&quot;.  It is certainly thorough in presenting a history of modern creationism and its spokesmen [if there are any women active in promoting &quot;creation science&quot; they don't appear here].  Strahler lays a foundation by comparing science and pseudo-science.  The contrast between empirical research and declaration from assertion should be apparent to all, but Strahler spells it out carefully and clearly.  From this beginning he takes us through a succession of topics, exhibiting the creationist declarations, then depicting the errors in them.  In some cases, the errors are simply false, while others are twisted use of words or ideas.  Strahler set himself a monumental task in composing this book, but as someone with long experience in the geologic column, perhaps there is no-one better qualified to assess the material.<br />This is a rich trove for almost anyone interested in the planet's history.  Most of the line drawings and other illustrations are worthy of close attention.  Although set as a counter to false thinking, there is a massive amount of material on such topics as radiometric dating, cosmology, geological processes, fossil analysis and the evolution of humanity.  Each area acknowledges the leaders in the research.  While crediting good studies, Strahler is careful to note where his fellow scientists have been slipshod or dismissive over word usage in dealing with creationists or simply reporting their science.  A worthwhile book for a wide spectrum of readers.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]smology, geological processes, fossil analysis and the evolution of humanity.

When the trip involves several years over millions of kilometres, the odds of unblemished success grow enormous.  Engaging in such a venture in the realm of space, almost beyond the reach of human control suggests hazards beyond imagining.  This book describes such a venture, perhaps the most ambitious ever undertaken.  That the measure of success achieved was so great is a tribute to all those who planned and implemented it.  Michael Hanlon gives us a ringside seat in his portrayal of the journey of the Galileo Mission to Jupiter.  Although not a participant, he ably captures the dedication and skills of the Mission Team.  Further, he's able to place us in the space vehicle as it traversed one of the most bizarre journeys ever undertaken.<br />The Galileo Mission was spurred by the preceding Pioneer and Voyager missions of the 1970s.  These four robots cruised through the outer solar system, returning stunning views of the largest planet and its associates beyond.  In doing so, they raised numerous and unanswerable questions about our neighbours in space.  Unlike the previous probes, Hanlon takes us through the planning that led Galileo's flight to Venus, back past Earth to its final destination far out in the solar system.  The efforts put into the flight brought Galileo to within 5 km of its intended position when it arrived at Venus - a staggering achievement.<br />All the planning and engineering couldn't prevent problems, however.  NASA's attempt to open the main transmitting antenna failed when some minor pins failed to release.  When Galileo arrived at its primary destination, the antenna looked like an umbrella wracked by high winds.  NASA used other methods to maintain communication, resulting in the stunning images seen here.  It was a frustrating experience for the mission team, yet Galileo added a treasure house of new information about our neighbours in space.<br />We are so accustomed to the notion that we are the sole home of life, that the problems surrounding Galileo's termination render this issue the most bizarre of the trip.  Europa, the ice-coated satellite of Jupiter, may contain living organisms in its hidden sea.  In order not to contaminate that life, if it exists, Galileo had to be purposely sacrificed.  Hanlon describes the options and why each was considered worthwhile.  Galileo went to explore the Jovian system and was still transmitting images as he completed this vividly descriptive work.  He is to be commended for a gripping account.  We may be the only life in this group of planets, but Galileo's records give us a major argument to continue our search for life elsewhere.

This is a sweeping examination of evolution's path leading to that mass of gray matter behind your brows.  Allman has synthesized a wealth of research in producing this study.  He explains in a clear, interesting style how natural selection has spent the last 500 million years tinkering with life to build complex systems from simpler ones.  He is a forceful writer, supplementing a fine text with superb illustrative material to build his narrative.  It's a refreshing view of natural selection's power of innovation.<br />Allman draws on the detailed research undertaken in recent years that has mapped the brain and detailed its operations.  Like all life, beginnings were simple, but small variations among organisms had the  potential for important roles.  Deep in the Precambrian, floating cells developed appendages leading to hair-like structures we call &quot;cilia&quot;.  The cilia adopted dual roles: sensing the environment and responding to it.  Allman explains how gene duplication led to opportunities for experiments.  This process demonstrates how we can track many of steps leading to today's life forms.  The original genes are usually still resident, with enhancements providing new functions added over the passing generations.<br />The author's explanation of the workings of chemistry in brain functions is worth close attention.  Behaviour is the result of brain activity, but the interactions of various parts and functions of the brain elude simple analysis.  One example is the brain chemical [neurotransmitter] serotonin which is found throughout the brain.  It's impact gives monkeys their social structure while adding to the risk of suicide in humans.  Neurochemistry alone doesn't explain the expansion of the human brain, nor does the author stop there.  He goes on to show how bipedalism, diet, language and social behaviour all working in self-reinforcing feedback loops led to the gob of tissue that takes a fifth of our body resources to keep working.  Even global climate changes played a role, coming at a time when our species was just prepared to contend with them.<br />The number and impact of revelations in this book are almost beyond counting.  The &quot;urban myth&quot; that women live longer than men because of improved health practices has been disproved both by history and anthropology.  A study reaching back into the 18th Century demonstrates that women have outlived men at least that long ago.  Among the great apes, chimpanzee females also outlive their mates.  Orangutans and gorillas have nearly parallel life spans between genders.  There are also studies showing how caring fathers have extended life spans.  His analysis of the development of colour vision is another novel thesis.  Colour perception arose only 40 million years ago, after the demise of the dinosaurs.  This raises again, the question of whether the emergence of flowering plants, which were toxic to those creatures, helped speed their demise.<br />While this book is not a light read, it's an informative and edifying one.  Allman deals with complex topics.  Adding to the elaborate range of material involving the brain, behaviour and social issues is the background of the immense time spans required in dealing with these questions in the context of evolution.  Given all these constraints, he has met the challenges of the task credibly and lucidly.

Eller asks matriarchal feminists to shed ideology for scholarship.  It sounds simple enough - don't build a mythology, even one with the good intention of providing positive role models, if the facts don't support it.  \\"Feminist matriarchalism\\" propounds the notion that in some distant past women ruled human society, guided by veneration of a universal \\"goddess\\".  It was supposedly a time of peace, good order and \\"nurturing\\".  She correctly asserts that \\"myth\\" need not be false.  A myth may simply be an inspiring story, whether based in fact or not.  Wilshire's \\"metaphoric truth is more real than factual reality\\" summarizes the task Eller has set herself to contend.  Her intent is to keep the foundation of feminist mythology on a firm foundation.  Deceit or deception can only harm the cause.  A topic clearly in need of critical assessment, this book stumbles badly in its efforts to enlighten us.<br />She examines an overwhelming array of writers, scholars, researchers to highlight her points.  While there's no reason to question her sources, there are a few in which the context might be enhanced.  One figure, as it must, stands out.  Feminist matriarchists must forever genuflect at the alter of Marija Gimbutas, and Eller is no exception.  Almost single-handedly, Gimbutas applied a background in archaeology with flights of inspired invention to lay the foundation of modern feminist matriarchal mythology.  Eller is at pains to keep Gimbutas at elevated status, and avoids deep analysis of the contrivances used by this pioneer.  None of Gimbutas' critics are given voice, even by burying them in the bibliography.  \\"Critics\\" are mentioned, but remain anonymous.<br />Eller is constrained throughout this book to keep her credentials unblemished.  She rightly fears the backlash that any critic of modern feminism endures, especially when coming from one of their number.  Her own career in this field she certifies as a \\"spiritual feminist\\", a term that remains enigmatic. \\"Matriarchal\\" must always be prefixed with \\"feminist\\" - although what other kind there might be also remains elusive.  Women, no matter what the cultural context, are \\"oppressed\\" or  \\"sublimated\\" or otherwise aggrieved as a given throughout the book.  Eller doesn't counter any of these ideologies, since they form the foundation of modern feminism.  In her desire to update the prehistoric data she extols the impact of anthropology to utilise more women.  They opened new questions about the role of women in various cultures and broadened the science thereby.  Yet, in Eller's view, these scientists must, perforce, be \\"feminists\\".  It's not sufficient for them to be women researchers.  Her approach therefore, simply diminishes the efforts these women scientists have made in furthering the science.<br />It is therefore no surprise that the generation of findings by sociobiologists of male and female biological imperatives are given short shrift.  No feminist accepts biological roots for any social condition.  After ninety pages of introductory persiflage, most of it Eller's attesting her own feminist view, she finally arrives at examining the data feminist matriarchal \\"scholars\\" use to define their mythology.  We return, as we must, to Gimbutas' her desire to identify the most mundane of artefacts as signifying the existence of a ubiquitous \\"goddess\\".  Figurines, scratches on bones, and, of course, motherhood have all been recruited to support the universal goddess thesis.  Eller deconstructs nearly every piece of evidence to produce viable alternative views.  It would be more worthwhile if Eller had reached for support from those who have done the job before, and in many cases, better.  However, these sources aren't lodged within the feminist camp, and are ignored.<br />The intent of this book is admirable - replacing fictional or contrived evidence with real facts.  Unfortunately, Eller is so concerned with maintaining her bona fides that this book becomes a test of fortitude, not a source of information.  If the word \\"feminist\\", for example, had been stricken from the text, or at least relegated to once a chapter, there would have been a considerable saving of paper.  Not to mention helping us to retain attention span.  There are far better sources on this topic, seek them out and save your eyesight.

The only thing harder to research than a historical novel is a pre-historical one.  Cornwell has made a serious effort to understand the how the Neolithic looked in southern Britain, then fit plot and characters into that landscape.  It's an exciting story, full of duplicity, heroics, deeply held feelings and almost convincing people.<br />Centred, as the title suggests, on the great stone monument on Salisbury Plain, he builds a narrative suggesting the motivation and labour involved in building this ancient site.  He uses two trinities to develop his story.  One trinity is comprised of brothers who represent material, mysticism and morality.  The other is three who, by stretching your imagination, might be Mother, Maiden and Crone of the slassical witchcraft Sisterhood, although those identities shift drastically as the story progresses.  The clash of greedy warlords with messianic figures is like something out of Sir Walter Scott.  Cornwell's technique  makes thrilling reading while upholding modern standards of justice and rewards for the good.  The good, of course, don't come through unblemished or painlessly, but they survive.  All the excitement and maneuvering raise this book a step above the modern fantasy novel, but the step is a small one.<br />If you're looking for adventure with an unusual twist, this is the book for you.  You will be taken back in time, through some spatial adjustment, but most importantly, view a society very different from the one you know.  Prepare yourself for a harsh existence while remembering that \\"progress\\" is a word with many definitions.  Perhaps there's some benefit in reading the \\"Historical note\\" at the back first, then delving into Cornwell's sources, before returning to this fictional account.  All of his resources are at least as readable as this book, and infinitely more informative, if not as imaginative.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]	2003-05-10

Even from this distance, Souden provides a close-up view of the monument, its landscape in time and space, and the history of thinking concerning its cause.  A first look suggests this is a &quot;picture&quot; book.  The photographs and graphics are uniformly of high quality.  There are fine maps and diagrams, but the real value is in the perspective drawings of Stonehenge in the past and the present.  These are ideally suited to improving the view for either visitors to the site or for those of use distant from Salisbury.  Souden follows the direction pointed out by British Heritage to round out this study with a plan for a Stonehenge theme park.<br />Enthusiasm for the illustrations, however, should not deter the interested reader from the worth of Souden's narrative.  He has performed a Herculean task in synopsising a wealth of information about the monument and the environment in which it stands.  He provides a fine overview of the likely social scene in place during the periods when Stonehenge and some of its neighbouring sites were being constructed.  In developing his theme, he introduces us to some of the contentious topics that have occupied scholars for centuries.  Did the &quot;bluestones&quot; come from Wales, or were they glacial debris?  Is Stonehenge a finished, if ruined, monument, or is there indication that attention was still being paid to it before the whole area was abandoned?  These are questions still plaguing students, and Souden has done a fine summary of them.  Given the nature of this publication, we mustn't expect overmuch from the Bibliography.  As a starting point, the list has much to recommend it, combining older and modern studies.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]	2003-05-10

Avoiding politics and polemics, he provides the historical roots of a phenomenon clearly of recent invention.  Pagan, Druidic and Wiccan organizations dwell on their roots from a distant past.  Hutton shows their origins are in more modern literature and structured on organizations such as the Freemasons.  There are, he emphasizes without rancour, no truly verifiable ancient origins for modern witchcraft.  Although some readers may be deterred by the scholarly tone of this work, it is precisely Hutton's detached view of these social phenomena that has been lacking.  He has filled a long-vacant niche and done it gracefully.  More importantly, he's given us a valuable history that will endure.<br />The underlying theme is clear - the claims of modern pagans, \\"wiccans\\" and other occult groups to clear roots deep in prehistoric times is invalid.  Hutton's research reveals the creation of various gods and goddesses arose from 18th Century literature.  None of the Enlightenment or Romantic era writers used valid sources to claims that Pan, Diana or other \\"natural\\" deities persisted into modern times.  All of the themes of \\"earth\\" or \\"cosmic\\" religions resulted from some disaffection - usually, but not always, with rigid Christianity.  These literary creations found a ready readership, usually among intellectuals, later with a wider public, disillusioned in no small part by the social disruptions of industrialising Britain.  A \\"return to nature\\" and its fabricated deities was an alluring solution to perceived woes.  The pivotal event in translating this literary background for modern audiences, of course, was the publication of James Frazer's \\"The Golden Bough\\".  Given the paucity of substance in that book, it's astonishing to learn it remains in print.<br />As Hutton leads us through the groves of literary invention, he frequently points out the brambles encountered.  It's easy to become ensnared by enthusiasm replacing scholarship.  Phrases like \\"without sources\\", \\"no research\\" and \\"leaping beyond evidence\\" occur with depressing frequency.  Yet note the lack of \\"fabricated\\", \\"contrived\\", or \\"invented\\".  Hutton is at pains to show that however ephemeral the origins, these writers, and their avid readers, firmly believe in what they say.  What they believe in appears to vary with each individual, but that seems to be the nature of religions, ancient or modern, according to Hutton.  Pan, for example, is mischievous, diabolical, sexually rampant or idyllic in turn as successive writers portrayed him over the decades.<br />The research underlying this study is staggering.  Over fifty pages of annotated bibliography plus numerous interviews and personal correspondence support this work.  He even manages to work in The X-Files and Terry Pratchett's Discworld series!  Hutton's crowded reading schedule offers a hedgehog of pointers for the interested, but the book must be read closely to determine which are worth following.  Some sources are more noteworthy than others, of course.  If modern Paganism can be said to have a \\"founder\\" it is in the figure of Gerald Gardner.  His writings, most of which fall into Hutton's scanty resource base category, initiated the wave of pagan witchcraft active in Britain and America today.  Hutton shows how, despite schisms and divergences, Gardner's idea crossed the Atlantic to find ready acceptance in North America.  There, merged with radical feminism, it not only took root, but rebounded across the sea to reinvigorate the British pagan movement.  However, lack of cohesion leads Hutton to view it as having a \\"luxuriant complexity\\".<br />Hutton is at pains to avoid blemishing his study with \\"reactivity\\" or \\"reflexivity\\".  The former, he explains, is influencing the beliefs or behaviour of those under study.  \\"Reflexivity\\" is what the historian undergoes when examining his own motives and reactions to the information acquired.  Hesteadfastly rejects the second while striving to minimize the first.  It's a difficult balance, but he has achieved both successfully.  The only real shortcoming in this book are the typos - jarring in a work published by an academic press.  One might like some illustrative material to break the monotony of text.

A wide-ranging and comprehensive catalog of human burial sites and artefacts, this book explains much about past conditions.  Bahn introduces us to many of the tools used in probing human remains.  Evidence of the local environment, combined with physical and chemical analysis of the remains indicates the health, life style and sometimes the cause of death.  His examinations are taken from a diversity of sites from nearly every continent [Australia is touched lightly through a site on an offshore island].  Along the way, many misconceptions are set aside and a few mysteries resolved.  But many enigmatic situations emerge with pointers to work that remains to be done.  Given the wealth of information available on many topics, Bahn is yet able to produce a solid, readable text.<br />From the suspected \\"massacre\\" at Mohenjo Daro to real ones in Vilnius and Beacon Island, Bahn relates the finds and what they mean.  The contorted skeletons of Mohenjo Daro appear to have met violent deaths during a conquest.  The real cause was due to a combination of flooding, tainted water and successive waves of building.  Other mysteries, such as whether Pharaoh Tutankhamen was murdered, remain unsolved.  Mummies from the Western Hemisphere, have proven more expressive.  Bahn evokes our sympathy for the Inca children found on Andean peaks.  There's clearly more feeling aroused at the sight of a nearly perfectly preserved ancient child than occurs with anonymous skeletons.  Even stronger feelings arise when you encounter the image of a young man wearing a helmet - and a rope around his throat.  Why was he murdered?  Even more poignant is the blindfolded girl with partially shaved head.  She was purposely drowned.<br />Even where the deaths were likely natural, Bahn gives us glimpses of inexplicable burial practices.  Many cultures have cremated their dead, but to pack the remains in urns placed in straw models of the living is unique.  For many centuries various societies disarticulated skeletons, choosing some bones for internment while discarding others.  Leg, arm and other large bones may be found but toes, fingers and ribs were thrown away.  The skull, of course, retained prominence, sometimes collected in large numbers.  Respect doesn't necessarily mean stability - many skulls seem to have been transported from place to place.  According to Bahn this suggests the living may have hoped to invoke the accumulated wisdom of the departed even if the external environment forced relocation.<br />As indicated, much of this book is devoted to images.  The photography is excellent, with images ranging from broad vistas to close-up analysis of disease-damaged bones.  Some of the illustrations depict reconstructions of faces built up from skulls.  Star Trek buffs will find the image on page 82 startling!  There are also many good drawings that amplify the photographs.  In fact, the only missing element in this book is maps.  Another near-omission is Bahn's bibliography.  There are references to specific sites and topics, all deeply academic.  For the general reader, the obvious target of this book, some additional general recommended reading might have helped enlarge the picture.  \\"Gray's Anatomy\\", while highly informative, is unlikely to occupy a place on your shelf.  These are minimal aspects of a truly worthwhile book.  Bahn's choices and presentation is a fine accomplishment at many levels.  Much of our past is revealed and questions needing attention are detailed.  There's more digging and analysis to do.  Start with this book to see what's been done.

Published just as the Internet was gaining wide-spread acceptance, it might have forestalled rash of neo-Druidism, Wiccan and other \\"pagan\\" cults the Web has fostered.  For example, a search in these pages on \\"wicca\\", \\"pagan\\" and \\"druid\\" returns over 1 400 hits.  The \\"wicca\\" books may be discounted immediately.  Assessing reliable material on \\"pagan\\" and \\"druid\\" requires close investigation of references - which is the motivation for this book.  Hutton insists on reliance on good sources and firm evidence.  Modern \\"pagan\\" cults  have no basis in historical or archaeological data.  This work thus becomes a fine discourse on evidence from valid sources and what it can tell us about the people living in ancient Britain.  Hutton carefully presents the evidence available from many millennia, declaring, among other things, that local customs far outweighed commonalty of customs.<br />Hutton's effort can only be called \\"sweeping\\" in scope.  Using a chronological structure, he takes us from post-glacial British Isles through the invasion and conquest of the archipelago by Christianity.  Early evidence lies in graves and their contents.  Hutton shows the diversity of structures, body placement, location and other elements indicates that each community followed its own rules.  Most, but not all, were adult males.  Body orientation and \\"grave goods\\" varied with time and place.  Even after Christianization local practices were retained for centuries.  How far these practices reached into the past remains unproved in Hutton's view.  Many \\"traditional\\" or \\"ancient\\" habits of recent decades likely originated in the 17th or 18th Centuries.<br />While building his picture of data reliability, he's scathingly critical of those \\"reading in\\" the evidence to create false images.  The most flagrant of these is the recent \\"Mother-\\" or \\"Earth-Goddess\\" contrived by Marija Gimbutas and her adherents.  Gimbutas finds \\"divinity\\" in nearly every artefact - \\"Venus\\" statuettes, painted images, carvings on bone.  Hutton is more discerning, arguing that we might view the Venus figurines as dolls or invocation to household spirits.  They are not, he contends, justifiably viewed as representing a single deity, nor even necessarily a deity at all.  He applies this skeptical view to a number of other widely-held suppositions, asserting that what is claimed must be proven.  That Gimbutas' unfounded claims for divinities have spread widely, even into university curricula, is sad testimony to the lack of attention Hutton's work has received.<br />Hutton is, in one sense, far too gentle in his approach in discounting the works of those misreading or inventing evidence.  He asks for validation of claims where he could be directly contending with claimants.  He has far too much respect for those who don't deserve it.  He acknowledges, for example, that Robert Graves' \\"Triple Goddess\\" was an invention - as did Graves - but neither has quelled the ensuing adoration of the idea by a credulous public.  Hutton also suffers from production cost woes.  The illustrations in this book are nearly all line drawings of carvings, implements and figurines.  While they illustrate his points, they are devoid of environment, leaving you wondering what else might be brought into the interpretation.  There are some reproductions of paintings which strive for accuracy, but they are mostly indistinct.  These illustrations are designed to convey the most likely cultural scenarios, but don't contribute to Hutton's presentation significantly.  They can all be generally ignored, leaving the reader to concentrate on Hutton's presentation, which is admirable.  If his efforts produce more excavations and research where these are lacking, then perhaps this book will have accomplished its aim.  His writing is clear even where the evidence is not.  Perhaps some of those taking this up will carry on the work to clarify what is missing.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]g this up will carry on the work to clarify what is missing.

Calvin offers an evolutionary description of the development of human intelligence.  He's very careful to avoid using &quot;consciousness&quot; since Dennett, Humphreys, Pinker and others have firmly employed that term.  Calvin cites Piaget's &quot;intelligence is what you use when you don't know what to do next&quot; as a foundation thesis.  From this he compares human mental talents with those of other animals, mostly primates, to demonstrate evolutionary roots for our intelligence.  Behaviour issues common to everyday life become visible evidence for what is going on in our brains.  Calvin manages to take his analysis into the physical processes that occur as we decide on our actions.  It's a well written and &quot;down to earth&quot; explanation of many questions we have on what intelligence is and how we use it.<br />Piaget's comment reflects the growing knowledge of brain processes.  Much of the brain's time is spent collecting, storing, retrieving and applying information.  This means that both &quot;unconscious&quot; events and our expressions and actions only come about after numerous and complicated signal processing has already occurred.  Calvin describes in both text and graphics how neurons are constructed, convey data, and interact within the brain.  Clearly, nothing is instantaneous and many elements are competing for dominance during every moment awake.  Clear, too, is the notion that while other primates have many talents to deal with their surroundings, none possess the powers evolution gave humans.<br />What drives these powerful mental abilities?  He rebuffs the idea of the &quot;quantum brain&quot;.  It's too deep in the brain's structure  - &quot;in the subbasement of physics&quot;.  That's too far removed from areas of vision, speech, and memory.  There are certainly quantum events going on with all that chemical and electrical activity inside your skull, but Calvin sees these forces as far to deep to have direct impact on mental processes.  Calvin is more concerned with the human level of analysis.  One proposal he adopts wholeheartedly, but without attribution, is Daniel Dennett's concept of the &quot;multiple drafts model&quot; of thinking and expression.  Calvin, to his credit, outstrips even Dennett's abilities of description in depicting this process.  He shows, for example, how the brain's memory storage facility considers many images before it resolves that the round thing flying past is a tennis ball.  It's an exquisite example, and you perceive clearly how many other daily occurrences are resolved in a similar manner.<br />The accumulation of evidence about our evolutionary roots, the environmental changes forced on us and the rise of language and use of syntax are all contained within a device Calvin labels the &quot;Darwin Machine.&quot;  The Machine has six &quot;essentials&quot; which cover topics like replication, mutation and success in adaptation.  He demonstrates how the &quot;essentials&quot; provide a mechanism for complexity from simplicity.  Where some creatures modified things like limbs, teeth or hair, it was our brain that evolved from simple to complex.<br />While evolution of the human brain isn't a new topic, Calvin presents a better summary of its roots and operations than most cognitive scientists.  This is a fine book to start any study of the brain, but must be enhanced by other, more complete, works.

He takes us on a global tour of various peoples and their histories in an attempt to trace the roots of human migration and settlement.  From his first major success with isolating DNA from a seven-millennium old corpse found in the Alps, Sykes began building expertise in tracing mitochondrial DNA mutations.  He found enough information to be able to calculate ancestral age and likely origins of European peoples.  In relating his career in this field, Sykes comes across as a bit ego-centric.  The truth is that he is a pioneer - this history of the work reflects much of himself and his team.  This highly personal and readable account reflects the intensity of his interest in DNA analysis and what it means for us and every science dealing with prehistoric times.<br />The idea that 90% of Europe's population - hence much of North America's roots - can be traced back to seven women living between 17 thousand and 40 thousand years ago is an eye-opener.  Yet Sykes analysis of how DNA in mitochondria [the energy component of all animal cells] changes over time is logically and clearly presented.  Having given up much of its DNA to that of the cell nucleus, the rate of change of this micro-organism can be readily calculated.  That mitochondria are passed down the generations through mothers alone simplifies tracing into the past.  Sykes restrains the traced path to European populations - with a slight detour into the Pacific islands - for simplicity's sake.  Attempting to trace the whole planet would have kept him at the research until now and the book would remain unpublished.<br />Tracking the genetic record led Sykes into some bizarre [mis]adventures.  A broken shoulder in Rarotonga, receiving packets of hamster poop for analysis, and the discovery that he had a genetic link to the last Czar of Russia.  He clashed with a leading figure in population genetics and one of his own staff.  He won both encounters.  More serious dealings are his resolution of the origins of Polynesians - from Asia instead of South America.  In relating this part of his work, he conveys his reluctance to refute the message imparted by the incredible voyage of the Kon Tiki.  He has great respect for Thor Heyerdahl's thinking and courage.  The later science of genetic tracing simply proved it wrong.<br />While some decry his speculative venture into the lifestyles of the Seven Daughters, the ploy adds to the feeling of attachment that Sykes wishes to convey.  Tracing ancestors used to be the hobby of genealogists, following church records and family histories.  Sykes' conjectures are based on solid science.  At some point grain was domesticated, as were wolves to become the family dog.  Although Sykes is compressing events, he still provides a realistic scenario of events in our history.  There is much to be learned from this book.  Perhaps more importantly, it is unlikely to be successfully challenged by later work.  This circumstance will keep this book useful for a long time.  A good read, based on good science, it deserves an honoured place in your library.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]igure in population genetics and one of his own staff.

He searches through history and psychology, sometimes successfully, for the roots of expletives and why we use them.  He also considers the reactions to such outbursts and their justification.  We are trained as children to eschew \\"bad\\" words, but males tend to overcome that brainwashing and use profanity under a wide range of circumstances.  Swearing is a near universal and must be contemplated in that setting.  Recognizing that fact, he argues, could provide a seawall against the tsunami of \\"harassment\\" litigation pending in the courts.<br />If profanity, which Dooling provides almost to saturation, has a natural basis, then the laws covering workplace expression are irrational and doomed to failure.  Worse, they seem to be having more negative impact on lives than on improving workplace conditions.  Worse still, is the potential for all this legal [and social] activity leading to thought control?  That ultimate question is Dooling's purpose in this rather impudent illustration.  He sees the application of civil rights legislation of the 1960s has led along unanticipated paths.  Civil rights, originally intended to protect voting and job rights, now extends into the realm of \\"feelings.\\"  Overt discrimination has been replaced by legislated politeness.  Dooling wants to curtail the highly questionable practices resulting from vague definitions and decisions.  This collection of essays boldly confronts us with past practices.  We need to recognize what has occurred and reverse the process. It's not a question of manners, but of reality.<br />The illogical roots of \\"political correctness\\" are now being exposed by many good studies.  This one happens to be one of the more senses-assaulting ones, but is no less valuable for that.  Dooling's position as a lawyer provides a solid foundation for his arguments, and his delightful style will amuse any but the defiant reader.  The examples he offers in support of his case should be noted carefully, they are being joined by others.  There will be more until the populace awakens to the threat.

Some wish to elevate him over Darwin, usually on the question of \\"priority\\" - who first thought up evolution by natural selection?  Others portray him as the victim of Britain's class structure - doomed to obscurity because of his humble background.  Shermer, although the title implies otherwise, makes an attempt to reconcile Darwin and Wallace, at least over natural selection.  From that point, Shermer follows Wallace through a complex life.  This readable, if somewhat shallow, biography does Wallace justice, but at the cost of shedding the broader context.  In support of his programme, he relies heavily on Frank Sulloway's research on \\"birth-order\\" and creativity.  This innovative study has had a rocky career, but Shermer finds it useful.  For him, the findings have meaning, but their validity remains unclear.  Especially when comparing but two subjects.<br />Wallace was a complicated personality, perhaps even more so than Darwin himself.  In order to build a coherent image of his subject, Shermer creates a \\"historical matrix model\\".  This is  a three-dimensional visual aid of the elements he's utilising in erecting Wallace's biography.  Mixing time, Wallace's various excursions and interests, Shermer ties the whole structure to his subject's views on evolution of humanity and the mind.  Whether this method works may depend on your attitude about applying mathematical structures to a man's life.  Fortunately for readability, Shermer keeps the application of this device at a low key, saving his analytical summation to the end of the book - where it falls flat.<br />Shermer traces the voyages Wallace was virtually forced to undertake.  Financial woes dogged the naturalist throughout his life, although it's hard to see that from Shermer's portrayal.  Although Shermer puts Wallace \\"in Darwin's shadow\\" he was easily as fluent a correspondent as his more famous counterpart.  Yet few of the cited letters contain appeals for employment.  Instead, Shermer takes us through Wallace's views on social questions, spiritualism and variations on natural selection.  He also shows how Wallace traveled and dealt with a broad spectrum of issues and the people associated with them.  Darwin, of course, maintained almost a hermit's life at Down.  It's strange that Shermer makes little note of the contrast of the two since much of Darwin's information leading to natural selection came from a global correspondence.  Wallace, ever the field researcher, relied more on his own collections for evidence.<br />Although providing us with a highly readable biography of the man, Shermer is virtually silent on the general social scene of Victorian Britain.  In pursuing his subject's life, we are given quirky events and some questionable people.  There's an excuse for avoiding the tumultuous politics of the era, but Shermer follows Wallace in his admiration for socialist Robert Owen and the role of Mechanics' Institutes to educate the workers.  Both schemes were designed to generate worker contentment at minimal cost - Britain retained a horror of worker rebellion after the Napoleonic era.  No mention is made of the Luddite or Chartist movements, which should have elicited comments from socialist Wallace.<br />A more bizarre oversight is Shermer's failure to impart Wallace's feeling on some of natural selection's sharper criticisms.  One in particular, Lord Kelvin's assessment that the age of the solar system was too short to allow the needed time frame for evolution.  Fleeming Jenkin's point that changes in organisms would be blended back, a point that Darwin, ignorant of Mendelian genetics, agonised over, is also overlooked by Shermer.  Since any biography of Darwin will deal with these issues at length, it's only logical that Shermer should have addressed them.  Either that or Wallace ignored them  - we remain in the dark either way.<br />Shermer's sins of omission may be forgiven as retaining clarity and brevity.  His committed sins, however, cannot be condoned.  His long career as an acolyte of the Pope of Paleontology leads Shermer to peck at Darwin's image.  The worst examples are intrusions of \\"punctuated speciation\\" in a variety of disguises.  Shermer's attempt to promote his mentor's outdated thesis borders on the pathetic.  He aggravates it later in the book with other Gouldian pronouncements.  Gould makes the index six times, with \\"punk eek\\" scoring another ten.  In a biography of Wallace, this ploy is simply an outrageous non sequitor.  He puts Wallace in \\"Darwin's dark shadow\\" [what other kind is there?], implying some sinister agenda.  Wallace is \\"eclipsed\\" by Darwin - as if Darwin so intended.  Darwin's opposition to spiritualism is a \\"secret war\\".  The position is misleading.  The shadow is cast by the long-lived eminence of Darwin's contributions, but Shermer makes no mention of that.  It's history's verdict, not Darwin's.<br />Shermer's use of Sulloway is bewildering.  Parallels between Darwin and Wallace are inevitable, but the author's are flimsy.  \\"Birth order\\" as an issue with these two men is misleading.  If he wanted to compare the two as personalities, why does Shermer ignore the similarity of Wallace's losing his first love, Marion Leslie and Darwin's loss of Fanny Owen?  That Wallace delved into a wider list of topics than Darwin keeps the former's public life more interesting, but doesn't move the latter into a \\"shadow.\\"  Wallace wasn't dogged by illness throughout his life - his long life certainly suggests good health.  He shed whatever Christianity he had at an early age, while Darwin was driven to abandon it from his studies and the loss of children.  Shermer doesn't need to shatter Darwin's image to restore Wallace's, but that intent is broadcast in his title.  It was a mistake.  If Shermer is intent on restoring Wallace's reputation, he should have hired somebody to do it for him.  Janet Browne would be a good first choice.

Barry Cunliffe gently unravels such &quot;Christo-centrism&quot; with a sweeping history of the Atlantic littoral peoples and their activities.  Using a wealth of archaeological and geological evidence, he traces cultural and likely trade patterns to build a picture of dynamic societies.  Unlike the accounts of conquisidor Spain or a globally imperial Britain, Cunliffe focuses on community life, active commerce and cultural exchange.  With a descriptive challenge covering nearly ten millenia, florid prose would be an unnecessary luxury.  The reading is anything but dry, however.  Cunliffe doesn't delve into much ambitious speculation, but he's careful to apply &quot;highly debateable&quot; to issues not clearly resolveable.  He combines evidence and logic in building his few speculations.  The resulting picture is informed and informative.<br />Cunliffe begins with the physical structure and changes the Atlantic area underwent after the glacial retreat.  As the ice melted, of course, the seas rose.  The lost weight of the ice allowed the landforms to &quot;rebound&quot;, a process still underway.  The result is a lack of uniformity in sea level change and coastal forms.  Rivers that once were self-cleansing slowed and silted estuaries and harbours as the land elevated.  He provides several maps indicating old and new shorelines to depict the various shifting of shorelines and port locations.  These maps and those showing grave sites, settlements, mines and artefact types enhance the worth of this book beyond cavil.<br />Throughout this account, the Morbihan coast and the Armorican residents remain the pivotal area of activity.  Innovations may arise and flourish in various places, but if these failed to pass through what is now Brittany, dissemination was unlikely.  The Gironde, Loire and Garonne rivers became the primary trade routes inland, but a lively trade must have flourished along the Bay of Biscay and Atlantic shores to the British Isles using short-hop local carriers.  Cunliffe's analysis is chiefly supported by grave and community artefacts of pottery, weaponry and jewelly.  While origin points for styles of these items is difficult to locate, their spread over time is more easily traced.  What is notably significant is the obvious two-way movement of goods - tin and gold coming into western Europe in exchange for fine pottery and metal goods sent in return.  The Armoricans were bypassed by nearly all the waves of invasion, keeping a traditional culture nearly intact until the Carolingian era.  &quot;Brittany&quot; resulted from the waves of Irish and western England emigrants settling there in flight from Norman incursions in the British Isles.<br />Faults with this book are nearly non-existent.  His bibliography, while extensive, might have been more detailed.  Ten millenia, even in a restricted geographical area, is ambitious coverage and listing even the better sources would likely have doubled the size.  A fuller bibliography instead of chapter references would have been a more useful tool, although Cunliffe is careful to note which sources have the best bibliographies of their own.

Books	4	11	11	N	N	Racing with rulers	This delightful romp through Britain's history from Roman to Elizabethan times is enchanting reading.  Although mis-titled, since Schama dispenses with two millennia in but a few pages, his engrossing prose keeps your attention fixed through every page.  He hasn't, of course, given us a &quot;history of Britain&quot; in any but a limited sense.  The theme is the governance of a nation with expanding and contracting borders, rulers and those aspiring to rule drifting on and off the stage, and the politics of ruling such a land.  The &quot;life&quot; of the country - the tillers, shepherds, artificers, fishermen, are pushed offstage unseen.  Not intended as an academic study, it's an entertaining overview.<br />Schama's prose is often evocative.  A prime example is his account of the preliminaries leading to the invasion at Hastings and the encounter itself.  We witness, almost as participants, the victories  and waning of Edward, king of Wessex.  His successor, Harold, crosses the reach of England to defeat invading Vikings prior to the rush south to counter William of Normandy.  At the battle site, Schama brings you onto the battle site, viewing the impending clash first from the English side, then from the Norman.  You sweat and reflect, facing determined enemies prior to the onslaught.  He moves you with the troops, thrusting, dodging, suffering as the battle rages.  By the time you reach the pages of William's consolidating his victory, you are breathless.  Schama is rarely detached from events throughout this book, and he has you at his side at every significant circumstance.<br />His discussions of the governance of Britain make compelling reading.  Just as we thought the Domesday Book was little more than a tool of Norman oppression, Schama depicts William as &quot;the first database king&quot; bent on achieving equitable enforcement of justice.  In later  years, Henry II would continue that tradition, ruling medieval Europe's greatest empire.  Without delving into tedious detail, Schama makes clear that ruling Britain at any level is a dynamic process.  Although the successive monarchs may appear a continuum separated by some violent events, he demonstrates that whoever sat on the throne must perform the task of ruling.  The methods may vary, sometimes harshly imposed, but tradition repeatedly impairs the march of change.  Anyone failing to understand this will fail to understand Britain.into tedious detail, Schama makes clear that ruling Britain at any level is a dynamic process.

Bold assertions, sweeping pronouncements, assumptions offered grounded on faith grip the reader's attention.  Such confidence must have some underlying justification, right?  New Age books have one great virtue.  They challenge \\"established\\" thinking with intriguing questions demanding valid answers.  Dames' book fits well into the genre.  It's an entertaining venture, filled with interesting ideas, vivid illustrations and based on the idea that remnants of the Neolithic world remain a part of modern life.<br />The photograph of John Barleycorn celebrants on page 17 sets both the theme and the tone of this book.  Why, asks Dames, is this bunch of rummies wearing those outlandish costumes, sloshed beyond reason, tunelessly singing some arcane melody?  Dames uses this image as a launching site to examine ancient rituals and explain their origins.  His focus is evidence derived from various burial sites and henge monuments.  For him, all these are indications of the dominance of the Hag Goddess supposedly prevalent in many Neolithic cultures.  Stone shape and placement, relative positions, accumulated debris and other evidence all points to a society dominated by rituals honouring the Earth Mother.<br />Dames doesn't just propose the Earth Goddess as the basis for Neolithic structures of widely varying design, he simply assumes it at the outset.  From that start he's able to dovetail an overwhelming number of graves, skeletal postures, barrow shape, location and orientation into his thesis.  Even the watercourses of the local streams have ritual significance.  He puts each artefact or other element before you with such confidence and enthusiasm, it's hard to resist.  If you take his presentation at face value, it's easy to become enmeshed in the image he builds of fertility rites, sacrifices and homage to deities.  No-one dies of old age or disease in Dames world.  Nor, it would seem, is there any place for males, either in the society or the heavens  [This was tested using the photograph on page 35 where one observer saw a phallic symbol and the other a subdued Hag Goddess.].<br />Although Dames asserts in one place that the Avebury Cycle is a cooking ritual, he later deems it the annual fertility rite.  Perhaps he was swept up in his own rhetoric while building toward the culmination of his inspiration.  For Dames isn't content with the spread of similar rites and behaviours over a scattered collection of communities.  There's a bigger surprise in store, which he graphically produces at the end of the book.  It turns out that not only is the Earth Goddess commonly worshipped throughout the Neolithic world, she has her own image for airborne viewers to perceive.  A nine by twenty kilometre area of the Wessex Chalk Downs has been configured around streams, henges, stone monuments and various grave sites to outline the Goddess to all who can achieve the altitude - or develop the imagination.  It's a breathtaking proposal - one that would give the ghosts of the Inca carvers of the Nazca Plain a tinge of envy.  Except the Inca, at least, made their images unmistakable.<br />Dames' book is a frolic for those not in the archaeologist's guild.  If you accept his opening assumption, the rest of the book is easy to swallow.  Evidence as limited as the Neolithic age has left us is easy to interpret.  Shade from proper lighting, pointing out what's there - when it is - strong assertions all lead the unwary to follow Dames sweeping assumptions.  But a closer look even at the evidence he provides leaves one in doubt.  Two low hills bracing a gully immediately become \\"breasts\\".  Try it with any two low hills in your area.  Dames selection would be laughed at by any Playmate.  It doesn't bear thinking what a Neolithic wife might say.

Changes must be made and the changes must be based on firmer understanding.<br />A story of a struggling lawyer isn't unusual, although this one is tempered by a grasping wife and her Big Money father, a lush suburban house and a position with the city's leading law firm.  The case itself seems simple.  A vocal racist is accused of murdering a \\"African American\\" [the \\"scare quotes\\" are an essential facet of this book] - who happens to be deaf.  There are heavy implications in this event, not the least of which is conviction for a provable \\"hate crime\\" invokes the death sentence.  How is a young lawyer, with neither criminal law nor trial experience to cope with the enormity of this situation?<br />The legal issues are more than words in the statute books.  Dooling's knowledge of science and technology introduces some fresh twists.  The circumstances, convoluted enough, become even more intricate as Joe Watson becomes mired in trying to understand the new \\"hate\\" legislation permeating American law.  How is \\"hate\\" defined?  As he researches the case, he meets neuroscientist Rachel Palmquist [whose name becomes an essential factor in their relationship].  Palmquist tries to educate Watson on the latest findings in human cognition as part of her efforts to seduce him.  Watson is better at cognition than seduction, as you will likely be as you follow her lectures on why we lack free will and what happens when electrodes are used to stir emotions.  All this cognitive studies material is, of course, the basis for the book's title.<br />The issue in this story isn't attorney Watson's struggles with morality nor the respective merits of corporate or criminal law.  What's really at stake is how the law defines and treats \\"hate\\" crimes and other politically correct issues.  Dooling's point is what laws are now on the books and the prospects for future legislation.  He wants proposed laws to consider the recent advances in behaviour studies.  Can the cure be implemented before the symptoms come to light?  Dooling, through his projection Watson, examines the science, the implications and the possible outcomes.  We are shown how some of the studies are done, not always a pleasant vista, but with human and legal implications.  Reading this book, it's easy to dismiss Watson as an over-focused simpleton.  When you realize he's speaking for lawyer Dooling, however, who likely went through much of the introspection Watson relates, this book gains in importance as a social statement.  Dooling uses several good sources for material for this book, although you have to go to his web site to discover who they are.<br />Dooling has given us an entertaining view of law and science brought in conjunction.  How good a job he's done depends on your tastes.  This is certainly not escapist crime fiction.  His concentration on legal and neuroscience issues far outweighs the specific crime involved.  His characters try fervently to express the many concepts this book deals with, but fall short of the mark.  The one success is Federal Judge Stang, whose seniority and astute understanding of law and lawyers make him the star of the book.  If you want \\"mysteries\\", go elsewhere.  ...Dooling's ideas and discussions of practical issues, however, are an excellent start in either direction.

This book is a tool kit aimed precisely at closed minds.  Assuming  that even closed minds have niches and clefts, Dennett's kit is for opening those nooks and crannies.  Every tool is a tiny wedge, each labelled \\"natural selection.\\"  The closed ramparts he wants to breach are concepts most of us hold dear - \\"determinism,\\" \\"free will\\" and \\"consciousness.\\"  He doesn't want to destroy those concepts.  He wants to part the seams to insert new material.  He wants his readers to \\"adjust their imaginations\\" to allow some redefinitions of these and other firmly held traditions.  For that, he insists, is what evolution is all about for humans - that ideas are constantly in flux.  Holding steadfastly to beliefs that new ideas challenge is our most grievous flaw.  Dennett's wedges, so earnestly and skillfully inserted in our minds through this book, offer the promise of a more rational future.<br />Dennett argues that \\"determinism\\" has suffered bad press.  We need to recognize that many things are \\"determined\\" - gravity, sunlight, the way our body's cells unite to keep you operating.  Determinism is simply the rules of the game of life.  That doesn't mean that the rules fix every aspect of life.  Various choices appear at different times at many levels.  Does the gazelle flee right or left?  Does a bird seek food at this tree or that one?  How many of these choices are \\"conscious\\" and how many innate?  Humans, as part of their cultural heritage, have tended to see only themselves as possessors of \\"free will.\\"  Dennett argues that there are too many levels and too many variations to take such an absolutist stance.<br />A long evolutionary trail operating within the \\"determined\\" world environment has led to us.  Humans, to a large extent, have overcome the barriers of what is \\"determined,\\" but we must be cautious in celebrating that triumph.  We are neither wholly free nor biologically driven.  It's too easy to slip from \\"fixed\\" circumstances into \\"fixed\\" behaviour, which Dennett brands a false assumption.  He scorns the frequently levied charge that evolutionary roots for our behaviour must deny our ability to think.  He's equally disdainful of those who argue that memes obscure our will.  His section on memes and memetics as a science is among the best in print.<br />No discussion on will can skirt the issues of ethics and morals.  There will be readers who will skip to Chapter 7,  yet those are the people who will pause at its title: \\"The Evolution of Moral Agency.\\"  Dennett's wedges are aimed at such, and it's to be hoped they will read carefully, as we all should.  Many preconceived notions are held up for close scrutiny and assessment.  Those notions are held by Dennett's readers and his critics and he addresses them ably.  If we possess free will, then we must use it - but we must exercise it from a knowledgeable base.  We must consider the impact of our choices before we apply them.  Dennett offers some practical examples, some of them jarring in their import, for you to consider.  The examples are those dealt with daily by law and government.  They confront you directly and, in a \\"free\\" society, you must make choices you can live with.  Dennett, far more than the rest of the philosopher's guild, confronts you with these choices in a clear and open manner.  There are no mysteries or metaphysics to unravel.

Cunliffe's status as a leading scholar in this field is well deserved.  This volume exhibits the result of many years of work.  The wealth and breadth, in both time and space, of the material preclude Cunliffe engaging in flowery rhetoric or idle speculations.  Using archaeology as the basis for his presentation, he provides both textual and graphic information.  The result is a thorough examination of the development and movements of the Celtic peoples.  Their impact on the geopolitics of Europe is great, he reminds us.  Place names, artistic styles, and numerous practical elements, many of which have been downplayed or ignored during the Christian centuries, remain as a legacy of their presence and influence.<br />Given the paucity of Celtic written records, Cunliffe begins with a early archaeological efforts and snippets of Greco-Roman observations.  What the Celts thought of themselves must remain a mystery.  Those observing them found a warrior society, highly sophisticated in that realm from both aggressive and defensive standpoints.  Highly mobile, the Celts established societies from Western Asia to the British Isles.  In their settlements, which became increasingly organized and administered over the centuries, they laid the foundations of many modern communities.  Cunliffe's accounts of these settlements, particularly those in the Iberian peninsula is likely to offer fresh information for many students.<br />Cunliffe gives us overviews of the &quot;barbarian&quot; migrations and their impact on European society.  The most important result of Celtic movements, of course, was the counter expansion of Rome.  Celtic domination of the trans-Alpine region drew Rome into Europe proper.  Rome's choice of land routes for armies instead of sea routes for trade meant occupation or dominance of Celtic holdings.  These counterforces had far-reaching results in all areas of European life.  Even religion, which was normally viewed tolerantly by Rome, came under assault when the Celtic Druids became the force organizing resistance to Roman rule.  Cunliffe traces these interactions with a scholar's precision, relating it all in a crisp narration.<br />The author's long career in this field has provided him with a storehouse of resources.  Aside from the fine bibliographic essay, he enhances the main text with excellent maps, illustrations and photographs, many in colour.  These cultural images impart a graphic sense of how misleading the term &quot;barbarian&quot; is applied to these people.  Their rich heritage, eroded by Rome and virtually eliminated by Christianity is revived by Cunliffe's superb recounting of their world.  This book is valuable at many levels and well worth the investment.

They stress the individual - individuals ranging from the mundane to those breaking \\"patterns,\\" exhibiting \\"abnormal\\" behaviour or showing creativity.  They open with an explanation of how difficult it is to explain individuality in Darwinian terms, but acknowledge that evolution is basis of how our brains operate.  With rich use of metaphor, and many examples from fiction, the text is free-flowing, if not \\"flowery.\\"  Devoid of footnotes and including what can only be described as a [sad] bibliography, the book is of mixed value.<br />The authors are exceptional at relative comparisons.  In order to place humans in a frame of reference with other creatures, they describe the environmental sensitivity of a bacterium, E. coli.  They explain that its information retention capacity lasts a duration of but four seconds.  In that brief span it must decide whether to pursue possible \\"food\\" or rest and wait for a change in condition.  They show that such decisions must be made by every living creature - how much energy to expend on survival strategies?  This pattern, with added  ramifications as you progress through more complex life forms, particularly ourselves, requires increasingly intricate reasoning powers.  In humans, many of these powers have been shown to be dependent on various neurochemical processes.  To the authors, this rules out any<br />genetic \\"absolutes\\" driving behaviour at the molecular level.  This \\"strawperson\\" has been built and scattered before.  La Cerra and Bingham raise their stook, then destroy it gently - but a straw man remains a straw man.<br />A number of scholars and their findings in cognitive studies are addressed, but only someone with a rich knowledge of the field is likely to perceive this.  Many ideas are presented, but you remain unclear of their origins.  Antonio Damasio and Steven Pinker are listed in the Bibliography, but the text makes no references to their views.  Careful reading suggests neither scholars had much impact on the development of the authors' ideas.  Daniel C. Dennett is given thanks \\"after publication\\" [??].  One yearns to read that \\"correspondence.\\"  To a degree this book insults the reader they wish to reach - those wanting to understand human reasoning and behaviour.  It is difficult to accept that an inquiring reader is going to be diverted by a few pointers to further information.  The reader is left with the impression that the authors have a new, innovative concept of thinking and behaviour.  Sadly, that's false.<br />The rich use of metaphor guides the reader over what might be otherwise difficult concepts.  The issues in cognitive studies are not simple, however, and require more explanation than the authors' seem able to give.  The metaphors, instead of aiding in the explanation, become roadblocks to legitimate understanding.  The authors leave the impression that all the issues in cognitive science have now been resolved by their book.

Mark Roberts, a young archeologist at the beginning of the excavations who became the Director of the site, is a dedicated digger.  He managed logistics, personnel, site management and analysed the results.  It is likely that he provided significant portions of the scientific background for the account.  The story is simply one of persistence in using evidence to gain support for extending operations when funding seemed threatened.  Those extensions continued to reveal an assemblage of fossils, tools, and other signs of human activity.  All from half a million years ago.<br />With the authors contributing background material on climate conditions, glaciation and sea levels, soil content and the new science of geomagnetism, we're given a detailed picture of the world surrounding those ancient people.  What impact did that environment have on their lives?  What does the evidence suggest about how they coped with what nature imposed on them?  Did they hunt, or scavenge?  Was meat a mainstay or a \\"side dish\\" in their diet?<br />This book makes a major leap of interpretation in formulating what sort of people existed those millennia ago.  With help from many sources, the authors build a picture of a sophisticated creature.  Boxgrove produced a wealth of flint tools and flakes, some the researchers were able to reconstruct into the original stones.  The evidence, they assert, suggests a creature with strong intelligence, capable of in-depth analysis in selected topics.  The most important consideration was in hunting and creating the tools to make the hunt a success.  Knapping flakes from flint is \\"more than banging a couple of rocks together\\" - requires the ability to foresee several steps in advance - \\"like a game of chess.\\"  The tools meant ready access to meat - and meat is necessary for increased brain power.  Far from a raw savage, Boxgrove's revelations image our ancestor a capable creature.  From this interpretation, it's clear older finds must be reassessed.  New discoveries will need to draw on the same interdisciplinary teamwork Roberts was able to assemble.<br />Fairweather Eden is a wealth of information, both historic and current.  Much background material is provided, interspersing the descriptions of participants in the finds and subsequent analysis.  One individual actually strips down a carcass with the provided flint tools.  Beyond the text is an array of diagrams and photographs depicting the information.  If this book has a shortcoming, it's the use of notes' sources in lieu of a bibliography.  That hardly detracts from its worth, however.  The amount and quality of work Pitts and Roberts have put into this study will keep it useful for a long time.

Each story relates encounters between Bethie and other women.  Men flit in and out of some scenes, leaving no prolonged mark.  Bethie's interactions with each of the women is related with deep introspection, but none of them, Beth included, exhibit any depth.  Not that any of the characters fails a reality check.  Hay is too fine a writer to foist implausible people on the reader.  The characters are carefully, even exquisitely drawn.  The exchanges are nearly uniformly superficial, but Bethie's reflections and self-assessments on them are intensely revealing.  At the end, you will ask yourself &quot;could this woman be my friend?&quot;<br />It matters little whether an individual episode begins or ends darkly - the darkness is there, persistent throughout the collection.  Bethie demands, in her mind, much from her friends.  Failure to deliver, or stepping from a preconceived image, arouses her wrath quickly.  That anger is expressed, but entirely in her mind.  Few shouting matches. No clearing of issues.  Simply drifting apart or, in a few cases, some prickly rebounds.  Being a friend of Bethie's is a high-risk investment with few rewards.  In fact, none of the relationships revealed here could be remotely called &quot;friendships&quot; no matter how frequently the word crops up.<br />Although a disturbing read, the nomination for many awards this book received is testimony to its value.  Calling the writing &quot;honed&quot; is puny understatement.  Yet, what the book accomplishes remains elusive.  Hay has offered none of her characters as a role model.  Perhaps the real challenge in this book is inherent in its &quot;women's view.&quot;  Is this book an example of why many women censure the right of male writers to assume their viewpoint?  This book may be throwing down the gauntlet to male writers to delve this deeply into a woman's psyche.  The vivid exposure of Bethie's inner thoughts so genuinely portrayed, show Hay's skills cannot be challenged.

He concedes at the outset that &quot;free will&quot; is usually considered a topic for academics to wrangle over.  One of his special talents, however, is bringing such subjects out of the scholastic arena and into everyday life.  He recognizes that all of us are plagued by outworn traditions and mind-blinding prejudices.  He wants us to free our minds of these restraints.  From there, he hopes we will enter a future based on more rational concepts.  It's an ambitious programme, but one Dennett presents with outstanding conceptual ability and skillful prose.<br />Dennett's use of the &quot;intuition pump&quot; to expose the &quot;bogeymen&quot; that plague our reason makes him unique among philosophers.  It's an analysis tool that more should emulate.  More significantly it's a method we should all learn.  Rigid thinking leads us down wrong paths and this work is a guidebook for avoiding that.  One of the wrong paths is the idea that &quot;free will&quot; and &quot;determinism&quot; are absolutely separate - there is no way to reconcile the two concepts.  Dennett shows that there are many forms of &quot;determinism&quot; in nature, and we are part of nature.  Humans, however, have a decision-making capability the rest of nature lacks.  We have &quot;elbow room,&quot; based on our consciousness, which gives us the ability to make choices.  The dividing line between what nature imposes and our mentality allows, is vague and indistinct, sometimes contradictory, but it's there.  Dennett wants us to recognize, so far as we can, which is which.<br />Dennett concedes that there's an apparent paradox in this view.  If we are the product of evolutionary forces, why isn't our behaviour preset in our genes?  It is, according to Dennett, but exercises only limited influence.  Our complex intellect allows us to modify those natural roots and give us what we see as unlimited choices.  We call this condition &quot;free will&quot;.  Dennett reminds us, however, that free will is no more an absolute than determinism.  Dennett's rejection of absolutes in any guise have led to many critical assaults on his work.  Yet, as almost the sole philosopher to adopt natural selection as part of his thinking, he has shown his work to be the most rationally based of all.  Far from &quot;dodging&quot; issues, he shows how this open approach can actually lead to a firmer grasp of issues.  As he points out, the issue is not a &quot;choice&quot; of absolute options, but &quot;control&quot; over the conditions.  It's not just choosing which path, but perhaps the building of a new one.<br />For Dennett, a topic such as &quot;free will&quot; is far from limited to academic discussion.  A clear concept of what free will entails has ramifications in law, education and many social policies.  He addresses many aspects of applying his definition of free will in the final chapter &quot;Why Do We Want Free Will?&quot;.  With a strong sense of the pragmatic, Dennett shows why our understanding of the concept has meaning for us all.  With his witty style and practical approach to what otherwise might be an obscure topic, Dennett has given us a highly readable and realistic overview.

The image of the &quot;Noble Savage,&quot; living intimately and in harmony with his surroundings is demolished by the evidence.  Instead, Flannery shows how the intrusions of humans into previously unoccupied lands led to mass slaughters and the extinctions of countless species.  His study covers the vast territories of the South Pacific - continents, large islands and archipeligoes - examining geology, weather and climate, flora and fauna.  After completing this book, you will have a new view of our ancestors and how humanity has viewed nature.<br />In describing how humans have revised the face of the globe, Flannery begins in deep time.  Tracing the breakup of Gondwanaland into what he deems Meganesia and Tasmantis - Australasia and the Pacific islands.  For millions of years, life there evolved in unique ways.  Isolated from the rest of the planet, Australia produced large marsupial mammals and giant bird species.  Why did they disappear without apparent cause?  After an examination of the likely candidates, climate being the most frequently cited, Flannery finds a different cause - humans.  Fossils in Australia show that the large animals disappeared before the onset of the last glaciation.  The extinctions, however, parallel the invasion of the continent by humans, people now known as the Aborigines.  In one sense, the loss of the large animals forced the invaders to adapt a less predatory lifestyle.  Mobility increased along with more selective hunting practices to maintain sustainable levels of supply.  In studying these techniques, Flannery is able to move on to the subject of land management in today's world.<br />Although Australia's evolutionary path was unique, the lessons derived from studying events there may be applied globally, according to Flannery.  Adaptation is an ongoing process, whether for &quot;wildlife&quot; or &quot;civilized&quot; humanity.  Change forces that process.  He aknowledges that in recent times change is more rapid and intrusive.  We need to understand what impact those changes have and what, if any, adaptations are taking place.  This book thus becomes and educational tool to help protect our own future.  It is his recommendations for action that makes this book far more valuable than as simply a study of extinctions.<br /> Flannery's many years of field studies granted him the essential background for this book.  However, it isn't simply a dreary recounting of how we've ravaged the globe.  His sense of beauty and love of life is vividly imparted in a deep personal sense.  You join him in his travels in New Zealand, New Guinea and other Australasian lands.  His fine descriptive powers and detailed knowledge combine to make this an excellent read.

Except for frequent returns to earlier information, this book is not a &quot;page-turner.&quot;  It is, however, a wealth of challenging ideas on how our Neolithic ancestors lived.  While North avoids suggesting that Neolithic Europe was unified in religious thinking, he points out areas of commonality.  Some form of ancestor worship, he contends, led to sophisticated insight of the heavens across Europe.  Over the centuries this knowledge went from star sightings to the recording of positions of the sun and moon at significant times.  The evidence for this thesis lies in the burial sites, banks and ditches, wooden and stone monuments dating back nearly seven thousand years.<br />With firm conviction, illustrated by numerous graphic images, North demonstrates how early burial sites acted to mark stellar risings.  Neolithic burials took place in a variety of sites: gallery graves, passage graves and dolmens, among others.  The prevailing final step was the practice of covering the site with a mound of stones and earth.  This could result in long barrows, mounds or other structures, but the one thing they had in common was to elevate the top above the surrounding horizon.  Using the surrounding ditch remaining from relocating the soil and rock, observers could note certain stars appearing over an &quot;artificial horizon.&quot;  North postulates a possible shift in focus from ancestors and stars to gods or spirits associated with the sun and moon.  This &quot;advance&quot; in thinking resulted in stone monuments like Stonehenge in Britain and sites in Western Europe.<br />In tracing the growth of religious thinking and its manifestations in Neolithic Europe, North sees consistency without unity.  What he does stress is the advanced thinking that must have been taking place during passing years.  Wood and stone circles were positioned with uncanny accuracy to perform their tasks.  He provides reconstruction drawings of many of the sites to display the limited fields of view they allowed.  Peering along the post alignments, only a brief glimpse of rising or setting sun was available to the observer.  Lintels, whether wood or stone, were designed to cut down on glare during sunrise or sunset observations.  The graphics illustrating these points require careful study, but are rewarding for that.<br />Some of his contentions seem implausible.  He uniformly places observers of stellar risings in ditches.  If these were religious leaders, this would seem a diminution of priestly status not seen elsewhere.  North has gone to considerable effort to demonstrate just how complex the sites are and what that says about the motivation and abilities of Neolithic peoples.  How much of this effort is his, and how much derived from others is difficult to assess.  There are frequent references to various authors in the text, but no direct citations.  His &quot;Bibliography&quot; is by chapters and too vague to pursue sources without excessive toil.  The appendices, on carbon dating, astronomical issues and geographical positioning are helpful, particularly if you have the maths.  Overall, this is a useful book, even if it must be read with a sense of caution.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada].

James Wilson has taken a place in that queue with this sweeping study of how native peoples were displaced, deceived, diseased and nearly destroyed.  It isn't pleasant reading, but conquest never is when told from the view of the conquered.  Wilson  attempts to provide a whisper of that voice with as many native peoples' accounts as he could obtain.  The result vividly demonstrates the disparity of outlook between the Europeans and those they overran over the course of five centuries.<br />Although no attempt is made to preface the arrival of Columbus with some account of the previous life of North American native peoples, the text recounts their legends and mythology as they are encountered.  Only a smattering of paleoanthropology is offered, and the &quot;consensus&quot; version of Native American origins is dismissed out of hand.  Wilson's regional approach is a refreshing departure from the usual chronological format.  However, since the focus is on the 48 contiguous States, region and chronology aren't all that distinct.<br />The issues are land and culture, with a seasoning of racism.  The native American &quot;used&quot; the land while the Europeans &quot;owned&quot; it.  Native American culture was disparate, often locked into local conditions.  Europeans imported a hierarchical society and imposed it wherever they went.  Since they went all across the continent, continual clashes were inevitable - and the Europeans won nearly all of them.  By the  end of the 19th Century, the &quot;Indian&quot;, if not extinct, had lost the continent and nearly all culture.  According to Wilson, that was precisely what the invaders intended.  Where slaughter failed, assimilation could still force disappearance of the &quot;native&quot; from society.<br />Attempts to rectify, or at least ameliorate what had occurred over the years, were doomed to failure.  The variety of cultures among the Indian nations made consistent policy by the federal government impossible.  State government attempts, feeble at best, were worse.  The closest to a rational policy for dealing with the remaining Indians in the 20th Century were due to one man - John Collier.  Starting in the 1920s, Collier struggled to restore some form of the original culture of Native Americans.  His programme, now referred to as the &quot;Native New Deal,&quot; was based on his own search for a solution to world problems of the era.  Years of effort were rewarded by his appointment as Commissioner of Indian Affairs.  The onset of the Great Depression gave Collier ample opportunity to propagandize his cause as an alternative to the failure of the dominant culture.  His efforts to achieve a form of &quot;home rule&quot; for the Indian population is reflected in many programmes still under consideration today.  He has left a long, and generally unrecognized, legacy.<br />Those bemoaning the &quot;lack of balance&quot; in this book overlook the fact that Europeans were the invaders and despoilers.  The spectrum of philosophies regarding the &quot;Noble Savage&quot; uniformly fail to address precisely what Wilson does here.  An alien culture displaced another, native one, using whatever means necessary.  It's a sad, but true, chronicle.  Wilson's depiction of it makes dreary reading, but that's due to events, not his style.  A fine introduction to the past relationship of conquerors and conquered, this book concludes with a realistic account of the present situation.  With increasing demand for resources by the planet's most avaricious society, sustaining or restoring Indian culture is a remote ambition.

Yet that very circumstance is a tribute to Elizabeth Hay's eloquent portrayal of two sisters in drought-ridden central Canada.  Her people are deep and complex, intensely drawn and immensely real.  Even the peripheral characters ring true, without the blemish of contrivance.  Hay's descriptive ability in both urban and rural settings gives this book further enhancement.  She vividly depicts the impact of environment on her chief protagonist, providing a framework for change of mood throughout the narrative.  Hay, too, is clearly a student of weather.  And a keen observer of people.<br />Norma Joyce Hardy initiates a life-long adoration of Maurice Dove with a touch on his cheek.  That she's but a child is of little moment.  That she's overshadowed by her sister's beauty becomes even less so.  Even at nine years of age, she's driven by determination to find the means to supplant Lucinda.  Resentful of her sister's looks, industry, and favoured place with their father, she becomes secretive, duplicitous, devious.  Lucinda, having replaced their dead mother, is vulnerable, and Norma Joyce takes advantage of that exposure.  Maurice becomes the tool for expressing Norma's envy, but she becomes the victim of her own machinations.  Maurice, unsurprisingly, is following his own agenda, and Norma's place in it is problematic.<br />In pursuit of Maurice, Norma Joyce's life orbits like an erratic comet.  From the most rural to the most urban environments in North America and back again, her loci remain vague.  Only Maurice is a fixed point, but that seeming stability actually is the cause of her displacements.  She is torn between seeking and avoiding him, particularly when the attainment of her goal leads to the inevitable result.  Hay brings the Hardy family out of dry Saskatchewan to &quot;golden&quot; Ontario.  Ottawa, however pleasant and green, fails to bring rest, and Norma pursues Maurice to New York City.  A greater contrast to Prairie Canada can hardly be imagined, but Hay guides us through Norma's transition flawlessly.  New York, however, doesn't resolve her situation with Maurice, which grows ever more complicated.  Nor is the relationship of the sisters granted an easy path.  Who carries the burden of Lucinda's fate will be the topic of endless debate.<br />Hay's account is admirable in its prowess in compelling attention to people and places.  The factual nature of her characters, their failure to fulfill simple expectations is a credit to her skills.  A love story of sorts, this is hardly a &quot;romantic novel.&quot;  It is a richly rewarding story, worthy of your attention.

It's well written and covers a breadth of topics and ideas.  Using the best evidence available, he breaks away from traditional approaches to reconstruct prehistoric society.  Instead of stripping away modern elements to derive Neolithic life, Castleden builds the picture of that society from its basics.  Opening with a portrayal of the Neolithic environment, he envisions how people would react to conditions then.<br />Environmental constraints and overuse of resources forced changes in lifestyle over the centuries.  Neolithic peoples originally inhabited the fertile landscape as farmers.  Their crops, however, quickly depleted the soil.  Castleden cites a study in Denmark of Neolithic einkorn wheat reducing soil nutrients in only three seasons.  Loss of fertility drove people to new locations or converted to a pastoral existence.  In either case, the ommunities remained small and tightly integrated, with settlements only a few kilometres apart.  The conditions also inhibited experimenting in farming or lifestyles.  Maintenance of a secure life took precedence over trying the novel.  The resulting conservatism led to a commonalty of thinking.  We see evidence of that in the multitude of Neolithic religious sites.  Stonehenge, Avebury,<br />Woodhenge, are distinct from each other in many ways, but their basic pattern is consistent.<br />Conservative rural life instilled fertility rituals dealing with crops and cattle breeding.  Respect for surviving elders led to cults dealing with death.  Castleden argues that it wasn't worship of the dead, but death itself that occupied their thoughts and practices.  Burial rituals and cemetaries ultimately produced the great henges and stone monuments.  Castleden acknowledges that the artefacts associated with the ditches, banks and the stone circles are the chief source of information we have in conceiving Neolithic life.  One missing element, and he finds this highly significant, are structures for defence or other evidence of conflict.  There are no large collections of arrowheads or spear blades found at the henge sites.  From this he derives Neolithic society as essentially peaceful, with communities acting in relative harmony.  Such an environment facilitated trade and information exchange.  He traces the major likely trade routes across Southern Britain and across to Brittany in France.  This view counters the long-held belief that these people were kept brutish and ignorant by being in a constant state of battle.  He rightly argues that such a social milieu wouldn't have allowed the construction of such sites as Avebury or Stonehenge.  He can't resist comparison with modern societies.<br />Castleden has enhanced a fluent presentation with numerous photographs, diagrams and maps.  There is some presentation of contending views on various aspects of the topic. Perhaps the most surprising topic is the enigma of Stonehenge's source of the massive bluestones.  Rejecting the \\"glacial erratics\\" position of Aubrey Burl, Castleden accepts the Presli Hills source.  However, he proposes the most novel  form of transport yet suggested.<br />Instead of the usual Presli to Severn Estuary route some propose, Castleden argues for an all-sea route around Land's End.  He contends some form of trimaran would easily make the journey.  Oxen-pulled sledges managed the final leg.<br />Although this book focuses on southern Britain of the era, the approach can be successfully applied elsewhere, even for other times.

Such an environment facilitated trade and information exchange.  He traces the major likely trade routes across Southern Britain and across to Brittany in France.  This view counters the long-held belief that these people were kept brutish and ignorant by being in a constant state of battle.  He rightly argues that such a social milieu wouldn't have allowed the construction of such sites as Avebury or Stonehenge.  He can't resist comparison with modern societies.<br />Castleden has enhanced a fluent presentation with numerous photographs, diagrams and maps.  There is some presentation of contending views on various aspects of the topic. Perhaps the most surprising topic is the enigma of Stonehenge's source of the massive bluestones.  Rejecting the \\"glacial erratics\\" position of Aubrey Burl, Castleden accepts the Presli Hills source.  However, he proposes the most novel  form of transport yet suggested. <BR>Instead of the usual Presli to Severn Estuary route some propose, Castleden argues for an all-sea route around Land's End.  He contends some form of trimaran would easily make the journey.

The physical evidence described here is enhanced with carefully derived suppositions about why stone circles, avenues, burial sites, ditches and banks were built.  Burl has a keen analytical mind.  He weaves inferences about Neolithic lifestyles with the information garnered from the available evidence.  While the information he presents is almost overwhelming in its complexity, Burl's writing style keeps the account lively.  You aren't submerged in arcane mysteries nor scholarly pedantry.  His adroit presentation keeps your attention captured as he leads you through the likely history of Avebury, Stonehenge and other Neolithic communities.<br />&quot;Communities&quot; is a word you will have in mind throughout this narrative.  Burl reminds us  that Avebury's structures were built by normal people.  They lived in the region, farmed, dug ditches, herded cattle and pigs, erected stones, traded with neighbours, and died.  Life, he asserts frequently, was tenuous and brief.  From this he derives their culture put much time and energy in dealing with the dead.  Ancestor worship?  Probably.  Fertility rituals?  Almost certainly.  All this activity, however, was chiefly pragmatic.  Neolithic society tried to propitiate spirits it could comprehend.<br />Burl scorns the modern mystical interpretations of Avebury and other sites.  He lightly dismisses the astronomical alignments as overblown.  The henges and stone circles may have marked some solar and lunar moon-rises and -sets, but only in a general way.  These people had practical needs, he says.  Precision alignments of stones or posts would be excessive effort.  Much work went into just building these structures.  Enough information to launch certain seasonal festivals or a reminder of births or deaths was sufficient.  Burl has gleaned enough information to outline the growth and decline of prehistoric societies, with the Stonehenge ultimately supplanting Avebury in dominance of the area.<br />The text is enhanced with a finely balanced mixture of diagrams, old and new illustrations of people and places involved, topped off by a collection of excellent coloured photographs.  One of the few shortcomings in this book is the selectivity of his Bibliography.  Many works cited in the Notes are not listed there.  Whether to keep the list short or to emphasise favoured works is obscure.  A minor point, but a nuisance when delving further into the topic.

"	It's easy to dismiss this book as a \\"military history.\\"  That view is too limited in scope.  What Kolko describes is the American propensity use military thinking in the development of that nation's foreign policies.  In a tightly written analysis, he shows how the United States is confronting a vast arc - reaching from the Persian Gulf to Southeast Asia.  The inhabitants of that extensive area have been watching the world's sole superpower stumbling about ineptly.  He declares American foreign policies in this critical area confused and self-contradictory, based on superficial morality and military adventurism.  The roots of their thinking, he contends, is the uneradicable notion held by the American military that technology reduces the duration of wars.  No amount of practical experience has been able to dispel that faith.<br />In Kolko's view, the worst event in American foreign policy history was the collapse of the Soviet Union and the elimination of communism.  No matter how badly the United States dealt with the misconceived idea that Moscow dominated the politics of discontent, it was at least a point of focus.  With the Cold War over, America is floundering about seeking ways to assert its unilateral power over the same group of nations.  After spending enormous sums to shore up Afghan resistance to the Soviet Union, America launched a war to demolish its government.  Right next door, Pakistan's resentment of American restoration of the Afghan Alliance and warlord governments is palpable, leaving the current government teetering.<br />Nor is Pakistan the only internally threatened state in the \\"arc.\\"  Thousands of American troops reside in Saudi Arabia.  That nation's internal \\"containment\\" policy led it to send hordes of disaffected young men to Afghanistan and funded the Al Queda movement.  Now, many of those young men, militarily experienced, have returned or are secluded and training others.  Kolko argues this situation has rendered Saudi Arabia vulnerable to an Islamic uprising.  Such an event would spread to many places, leaving American military forces isolated and surrounded.<br />America's interventions in foreign countries, ranging from supplying and training police forces to outright occupations, have been based on the belief that military solutions are quick and final.  Kolko demonstrates that fifty years of adventurism have shown they are neither.  The wars, such as Viet Nam and Kosovo, have shown them to be neither.  The human costs are simply ignored or dismissed by American policy makers.  The result is that now the United States has been directly assaulted and will remain a combat zone for years.  Clearly, his purpose in writing this book is to alert Americans to their danger.  Even if the American voting public forces administrations to abstain from ad hoc interventions in other nations, the time it will take for foreign resentments to subside will be a duration of generations.<br />However, the start must be made, and made now.

An offshoot from his earlier work on the Vikings, this book displaces the Norsemen as the earliest European colonists of North America.  Mowat's expressive talents are given free rein to question consensus history and propose a new thesis - even before the Norsemen, Scottish exiles reached this continent long ago.  Mowat is quick to assert his ideas are speculative.  He offers good evidence that he's seen directly or researched.  The force of his narrative skills submerge that disclaimer almost to obscurity as he presents a mixture of fact and fantasy throughout this book.  It's a rewarding read, and the validity of his conjecture may be deferred until you close the final page.<br />Mowat's speculation on Scot explorers reaching the New World begins with a stone ruin in the Canadian Arctic.  The unusual shape indicates the roofing material was a large boat.  Houses of this oblong form can still be found in the outer islands of Scotland.  As Mowat notes, the technique is testimony to efficient use and durability of the materials.  The early people of Western Europe and the British Isles built long-lasting boats using a strong wood frame and easily replaceable skins.  Strong and seaworthy, they put to sea in these boats for distant voyages.  More distant, in Mowat's view, than we've previously conceived.<br /><br />He proposes that settlements dotted the Eastern Arctic and along the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador.  The communities were founded by the descendents of the &quot;valuta men&quot; who first sought walrus tusks.  The ivory was valuable and found ready markets.  But the walrus herds died out or moved elsewhere.  Meanwhile, population shifts in Europe put pressure on the home communities of these voyagers.  They were driven to Northern Scotland, Iceland, Greenland and, finally, the Canadian shores.  When they went, stone beacons for both sea and land navigation were erected to become their legacy in the New World.  All these events pre-dated the legenday Leif Ericson's &quot;discovery&quot; of Vinland in the 11th Century.<br />Whatever the validity of Mowat's assertions, and he puts them forward vigorously, the story he tells merits further attention.  Weaving a fictional account of the voyagers' lives and motivations through the historical text is a novel approach.  With Mowat, the technique is superbly successful.  If the book only forces further research by unpredjudiced investigators, it will have been worth the writing.  It is clearly worth the reading.gacy in the New World.

Sawyer's &quot;poetic licence&quot; must run many pages, imposing few constraints.  Travel permits are included.  He takes us across many borders - between nations, between universes, between species, and over into gender relations.  We tour around many fields - geophysics, genetics, cosmology, and, of course, paleoanthropology.  If any writer can keep the science in &quot;sci-fi,&quot; it's Sawyer.  It's a fascinating journey, undertaken at a headlong pace.  Through it all, we follow the complex lives of human Mary Vaughan and Neanderthal Ponter Boddit.  If all this seems heady stuff, fear not.  Sawyer's skillful prose and vivid portrayals will keep you reading steadily.  It's all realistic, if not real.<br />Writing a trilogy has inherent dangers.  A second volume must stand alone, which this one does.  The characters must build and not slip into static postures.  Sawyer accomplishes this by the simple expedient of increasing the interaction of the two protagonists.  The plot must move in new directions.  This is also achieved, not least by Ponter's return to this &quot;Earth&quot; and Mary's journey to the Neanderthal universe.  In their respective universes, Mary and Ponter encounter new people, achieve new levels of interaction and struggle to resolve contentious issues.  This last, of course, is but partially successful.  This is, after all, a trilogy.<br />Most readers of this book will have read Hominids, and will go on to finish the trilogy.  Readers must be warned, however, Sawyer has a poorly hidden agenda.  As in many of his other works, Sawyer seems intent on bringing us to his god.  An astonishing amount of time is spent in both volumes on discussions of faith and, that old bugaboo, the &quot;afterlife.&quot;  Little of Ponter's science is discussed, but his personality is drawn as cool, rational almost to an extreme.  A major scene in this novel, and its most inconsistent one, is Mary and Ponter's visit to Washington, DC.  For reasons wholly inexplicable in a Canadian who wished to keep Toronto's CN Tower in view from Rochester, NY, she drags him to the Viet Nam Memorial, engaging him in another sermon about &quot;faith.&quot;  This time, unlike in Hominids, where he resolutely rejected her ideas, he waffles.  Volume three, Hybrids, is almost certain to have him converted.  After all, against all logic, he claims to be in love with her.  What is motivating Sawyer in these efforts remains a mystery.  Perhaps it's time for him to produce a non-fiction statement of his philosophy.<br />Even with the &quot;faith&quot; shortcoming and some severe bending of anthropology and cosmology, this book remains an excellent read.  Sawyer's writing is masterful and his use of real science, no matter how contentious the topics, must be applauded.  If he &quot;takes sides&quot; why should we condemn his choices?  The final volume will be welcome and the entire trilogy a valuable asset as an exhibit of his skills and the readers' taste.

It is interesting to consider which of the many available chemical compounds some \\"observers\\" might use when assessing Britain's famous megaliths.  Aubrey Burl, leading scholar in the field, contends the local pubs have sufficiently potent solutions.  Clearly, something more than simple daylight is required to inspire some of the novel insights published over the years.  Meaden's source of inspiration remains obscure.  What is vividly clear from this book is that Meaden's imagination far exceeds his vision - or data.<br />His thesis is that the stone monuments at Avebury are the symbols of an intense Neolithic fertility cult.  The shapes of the stones, their various surface irregularities and their \\"orientation\\" all represent devotion to a goddess cult.  Filled with speculation, vivid photographs, even more vividly interpreted, the book is a testament to what imagination can produce.  Meaden states that \\"left-facing\\" stones represent Neolithic \\"femininity,\\" while the \\"right-facing\\" ones are \\"male.\\"  There are breasts, vulvas, various orifices, phallic stones and their shadows.  It's a provocative parade of lithic seduction.  Evidence for his interpretations relies on his own, earlier, work.  No other supportive material is provided - except for his portfolio of carefully situated photographs.<br />While the maps and diagrams are useful, the photographs belie Meaden's attempts to show us something any geologist can explain.  The profile of the human face is not a complex shape.  A long curve, broken only by a couple of protrusions - the eyebrow, nose and lips.  In stone profiles, the chin is nearly universally absent.  A face of rock, irregular to start with, is subject to many forms of weathering.  A little water, winter-frozen in a cleft, breaks off, leaving a recess with outcrops above and below.  Voila!  We now have the eyebrow and nose of a \\"face\\" seen from the side.  Usually, the form can be detected only during certain times of the day when the shadows are longer, leaving the shapes more distinct.  Meaden's collection of photographs beautifully depict how this erosion is revealed.<br />One should always be cautious opening a book with the words \\"the secrets\\" in the title.  The implication is almost always that the author has made a revolutionary discovery the rest of us dullards have not.  This book is an excellent example.  While it would be delightful to learn someone has truly revealed a major aspect of Neolithic society, that breakthrough hasn't been achieved here.

Ottawa author Marwan Hassan contends, however, that Columbus' voyage is but incidental to that celebrated date.  The year is also that of the Reconquista - the expulsion or forced conversion of the last of the Arab residents of al Andulus, the southern part of the Iberian peninsula.  Europe's occupation of Arab Spain is the pivotal event in the march of European capitalism - a march still under way in this era of \\"globalisation.\\"  Columbus' journey was the first step in the assault on resources outside Europe.  From these events the power of the state extended through the process of categorizing both domestic and foreign populations through various forms of<br />census-taking - what is known today as \\"demography.\\"<br />In this invigorating and challenging study, Hassan explains how capitalism's growth was furthered by population counts.  It goes well beyond simple enumeration.  Counting becomes classification, with various parts of society being administratively differentiated.  The counters become the definers, enhancing the \\"us\\" and \\"them\\" separation of people.  The process began in Reconquista Spain with the former Arab inhabitants becoming known as \\"Moors,\\" a contrived term.  By creating an image of inferiority, nascent European imperialism was free to absorb Arab science, mathematics, technology and trade and finance skills without qualm.  Hassan argues that Columbus' voyage could never have been achieved without the navigational prowess adapted from \\"Moorish\\" peoples around the Mediterranean.  Even so mundane an item as paper contributed to the growth of Euprope's expansion.  The Moors were the makers and purveyors of cheap, quality paper for accounts and records, vital to administration, both domestic and imperial.<br />Hassan demonstrates how language becomes a tool of demography.  Numbers don't stand alone, but must be analysed and interpreted.  The power of words extends further with simple record keeping than all fiction's self-assertion.  India's abundant  population was ruled by a much smaller British community, he reminds us.  The sceptre of that rule wasn't military, but language.  Europe's exploitation of African slaves, so essential to rapid settlement of the Western Hemisphere, was mandated by defining both the Africans and the peoples indigenous to the New World as \\"barbarian\\" or \\"tribal\\"  This definition validated the use of available resources and began the process of labour alienation.<br />Even the arts are addressed within this framework.  Not only is art \\"by\\" someone, implying individuation instead of community, but it has \\"value.\\"  Comparison of \\"value,\\" with hierarchical rankings logically follows.  Art's \\"marketability\\" becomes the standard.  \\"Kitsch\\" is the utilitarian art form appropriate to capitalism, with its \\"inability to appease the appetite.\\"  Consumption, therefore, is a never-ending spiral.<br />He provides a world view of capitalism rarely encountered.  Rigorous scholarship and deep analysis produce stimulating questions for your reflection. ...er with simple record keeping than all fiction's self-assertion.

This book, in many ways, is the culmination of years of research and publications.  It brings to light some of the latest thinking on the origins of monuments like Stonehenge, Stanton Drew and Rollright.  The selected sites are each unique in their own way.  Burl presents historical considerations of the stone circles, updated with his own and others' insights.  He's a vigorous writer, sharply critical where needed - equally praising when appropriate.  A great demolisher of myths and mistakes, he uses the selected sites to demonstrate valid methods of study.  His aim is to sweep away false or inadequate explanations to bring the sites and their builders to life.  He's keenly aware that these are the<br />constructions of real people.  Bringing those people to life is a major aim of the book.<br />This tour of selected stone circle sites makes compelling eading.  Burl's witty style is enhanced by outstanding photography and many informative line drawings.  The illustrations alone might put this book in the &quot;coffee table&quot; class, but the serious scientific base grants the book better status.  Burl stresses the complexity inherent in each of the sights.  Stonehenge, the prime example, was built through several phases, each taking previous structures into account.  We are misguided into thinking overmuch about the visible stones, when much more, often indications of wooden structures, lie underground at the sites.  This evidence, according to Burl, conveys a fresh story about the people building them than do the stones, standing or fallen.  Burl argues that the lithic evidence indicates woodworking techniques were used to form the rocks of Stonehenge.<br />For those new to the topic, this book may seem somewhat overbearing.  Burl attempts to clarify many issues [&quot;axes to grind&quot; if you will], most particularly the astronomical orientations of many of the stone circles, and their means of construction.  He is particularly emphatic over the question of transportation of stones from southern Wales.  The feat, he stresses, is clearly implausible.  His contention is that the stones were local to what is now Wiltshire.  They were &quot;erratics&quot; deposited by glacial action.  Neolithic peoples moved, shaped and placed them.  At Stonehenge, construction techniques are more typical of woodworking, but in stone.  Burl's suggestion is that the technology was imported from Brittany, likely through workers imported from that region.<br />Burl has provided a good starting point for those interested in our historical roots.  Clearly, the Neolithic people who built Stonehenge, Swinside and the other sites have left a legacy we share in some part.

He formulates a religion common to the peoples of western France and all the British Isles.  Most scholars of the Neolithic age accept solar and lunar worship.  Grundy outstrips them all with a concept of &quot;elite&quot; priests of Britain and France conferring on megalith locations and use.  Not content with the sun and moon, Grundy has the stone and post monuments targeting a variety of stars and planets.  In order to keep the alignments rigorously placed, his &quot;priests&quot; make incredible journeys - one lollops 130 kilometres in 24 hours!  These are busy lads - no mention of priestesses nor goddesses occurs.  They travel the length and breadth of the British Isles over five thousand years ago, making sightings, keeping records and prospecting for &quot;the right rocks&quot; to do the job.<br />Grundy has deduced all this from a close study of map locations of the various henge and menhir sites bracketing the English Channel.  One can imagine him with his metre stick, finding henges and barrows, then swinging the stick over the map to see what can be made to intersect.  His engineering background is manifest as he ties Carnac in France to Land's End and the Orkneys in Scotland.  It's an ambitious effort, one worthy of a pope's division of the globe.  One of the lines could be the Neolithic Prime Meridian, although lying a bit west of the current Greenwich line.<br />Not only does he manage to line up nearly every stone grouping in this cross-Channel exercise, he derives the rituals and records involved in this feat.  He graphically describes where each priest, acolyte and tribal chieftain stands during the eremonies.  The only thing missing are the hymns and sermons the stones and their target stars and planets evoked.  He grants them immense engineering knowledge, insisting it was handed down over the generations until suborned by the Roman invaders.  Unlike the Christians who tore down or farmed over the Neolithic sites, the more practical Romans conscripted the priests to design the British road system!<br />Grundy's writing reflects his engineering roots.  It's solid and unequivocal.  He &quot;suggests&quot; nothing, simply stating his points baldly, albeit clearly.  Although he cites many of the prominent figures in Neolithic henges, few of their findings are accepted intact.  Those with a solid astronomical background might find this book useful in some bizarre circumstance.  Cartographers will blench at the way maps vary in quality and usefulness.  Serious Neolithic scholars will wonder why trees were felled to make the paper for this book.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]orned by the Roman invaders.

Two great bastions of Empire have succumbed to Japanese invasions, and Frank's Sydney stands imperiled alone.  As the remaining outpost of Empire, Sydney has become a military crossroads and, if the Japanese haven't invaded, the Yanks have.  They are ubiquitous - on the streets, in pubs, and taking up with Sydney women.  One of these women, a \\"POW widow\\" encounters Frank, setting off a disturbing chain of events.<br />War is busy time for young men - committment, training, combat.  When that young man happens to be a priest, further emotional conflicts needing resolution arise.  Social pressures become intense, with people seeking  solace wherever it can be found.  Frank's confessional has a queue.  He's even more popular than the parish priest - \\"You'll have to put in for overtime!\\", Fr. Carolan tells him.  There's more involved than Frank's light penances.  He feels the need to reach out and bring consolation instead of waiting to be asked.  That leads him to cross parish boundaries in support of an AWOL soldier.  Crossing that line adds further complexity as Frank's confronted with race issues.  Between the temptation of a woman, the startling revelation of child abuse, and a murder, Frank leads a hectic existence.<br />In one sense, Keneally's plot is relatively transparent.  His characters follow predictable paths once they're introduced.  Although not a \\"mystery\\" writer, he provides a murder and the perpetrator can be only one character.  With Keneally, this is hardly a shortcoming.  His strength is character development, and whatever your opinion of Frank Darragh, Keneally has portrayed him with his usual finesse.  As with all Keneally fiction, this book ends with the resolution of a moral dilemma.  The impact of that issue has little to do with the plot - it's wholly in the hands of the protagonist.  Keneally's command of language and his ability to reveal inner feelings is unmatched and well demonstrated here.

You're the honoured guest at Mike Pitts' party.  He's set up a receiving line.  You meet a guest, are given some personal background, there's a bit of chat, perhaps a short show and tell, then on to the next.  They're a varied lot - an RAF veteran, a testy lady, students of all kinds, scholars and civil servants.  Off to one side huddle a scruffy group of fishermen.  They seem unimportant, but they're vital to this book.  Everyone here, including you, Pitts hopes, has a common interest - the henges of Britain.  Each of them has contributed something to a better understanding of the ditch circles, posthole remnants, standing and fallen stones, and corpses that make up the hengeworld.  They all want to know how the henges were built and by what sort of people.  Mostly, they want to know why these monuments came to be.  Perhaps you can help answer the questions.<br />Originally subtitled &quot;Why Was Stonehenge Built?&quot;, this question remains glaringly unanswered by this book.  Yet in pursuing the inquiry, Pitts has provided more information about the sites, their construction and environment than any other single source.  Pitts' title reflects his attempt, largely successful, to bring to life the circumstances and people involved in the multiple constructions scattered about the British landscape.  He stresses that all the henges underwent successive building or remodeling over the centuries.  Ditches and banks established an enclosure, later modified by circles of posts.  Sometimes, as at Stonehenge, dedicated residents finished the project with stone monuments.  Over the centuries, those people died, or were killed, their bodies interred within the enclosures or nearby.<br />Pitts explains how information is gleaned on ages of the sites, condition of the artefacts unearthed, morphology of the disinterred corpses.  In his quest to show us the lives of the builders and occupiers, he has a face built from skeletal remnants.  Don't skip over that image, it may be one of your ancestors. He provides a wealth of other images - many fine maps, tables of artefact ages, photographs of workmen [some at your party] unearthing or restoring the sites.<br />The &quot;Why?&quot; remains elusive, for many reasons.  We have no written records, of course, and the carvings on stones are enigmatic.  So is the positioning.  If Stonehenge's Heel Stone doesn't mark the midsummer sunrise, why is it placed where it is?  Why is there a preponderance of cattle remains at Stonehenge, but pig remains at Woodhenge, only a few kilometres [and years] away?  Why are there massive wood constructions, many with human remains adjoining the posts, as well as stone monuments?  Why is Stonehenge's construction method such a departure from the remaining henge sites?  And why, if they did, should Stonehenge's builders have trekked all the way to southern Wales for building materials?  [That's similar to my walking to Toronto, buying the Province's legislature building, tearing it apart and returning the stones to Ottawa by way of Lake Ontario and the Rideau River - 900 kilometres round trip.  Try that thought experiment in your own locality.]<br />Pitts proposes Neolithic peoples had the dedication to mount such an expedition.  Their motivation, in his view, is ancestor worship.  Such doctrines have built the Pyramids, Gothic cathedrals and Greek temples, he reminds us.  Faith, dedication and some special talents are all that's needed.  Return to our party.  The group of fishermen at Pitts' gathering likely went off to the pub.  After a few pints, they were queried about the tides, weather and currents around the southern coasts of Wales.  Some numbers scribbled on a beer mat is given to us as testimony that, yes, 'we could transport your stones 260 miles [Welsh fishermen think Metric is a Czech poet].'  Thus Aubrey Burl's insistence Stonehenge came from local stone is disposed of.  Perhaps.  However, implausible, Pitts has done a well-researched and vividly presented job of viewing the hengeworld.  Read it with pleasure.  Study it for information gems of the Neolithic world.  You won't be disappointed in either case.  And you might be motivated to solve some of the issues he lists as needing investigation.  [stephen a. haines, Ottawa, Canada]sented job of viewing the hengeworld.  Read it with pleasure.

The authors guide us with accounts of their own and the people who live and roam in this vast, dry world.  You will find adventure, politics, geography, economics and no little despair.  What they offer you is a window into understanding what desert life means.  Paradoxically, that understanding means water - where is it available?  how can it be obtained?  how much is there to be found?  Water permeates almost every page of this narrative of the driest land in the world.  While this book may seem only of limited interest, something potential adventurers would read, anyone interested in our world will find it rewarding.<br />Among other myths this book demolishes, the concept of the \\"empty desert\\" is quickly dispelled.  It opens in a remote site, seemingly beyond human ken.  Yet, the opening words reveal three desert men, silently riding camels, passing through a camp.  From this opening, the authors introduce us to writers on the desert.  They guide you along the ancient history of this vast, dry land.  It wasn't always a desert, as fossil testify.  The Sahara has been grassland, desert, forest and desert again.  These cycles indicate the movement of the continents, the shifts of climate and irregularities of topography.  Changes in the Sahara stimulate and reflect variations in oceanic currents, air movements, and, of course weather patterns and rainfall.  Even today, as the authors stress repeatedly \\"the Sahara is closer than one might think.\\"  Dust storms send detritus across the Atlantic, conveying organisms that can lead to novel diseases.<br />European visitors have left indelible impressions of a land they poorly understood.  The many stereotypical desert images, such as vast expanses of sand dunes, are misleading.  The desert, as the authors stress often, is a land of rocks and stones.  And, if you know how to find it, reserves of water.  Many have perished seeking water's benefits.  Modern research has pointed to \\"fossil water\\" lying beneath the rocks.  This is being tapped and de Villiers and Hirtle note the impact of this withdrawal remains in dispute.  Although the subterranean water table is lowering, there is evidence that replenishment is occurring.  Whether it's enough remains to be determined.<br />Outstanding in this work is the depiction of the various civilizations that arose in the Sahara.  Comprising nearly half the book, the authors point out that the Sahara has been home to more than just the Dynasties of the Nile Valley.  From Neolithic times, when stone circles matching any in Europe were erected, mighty empires have risen and flourished here.  Mali, the Old Ghana and the Almoravid are but examples.  Trade, culture, science, arts and crafts developed and were exchanged among diverse peoples.  The tragedy of European invasion is not only slavery, but the erasure of memory of these complex societies.<br />The authors have an novel technique in recounting their desert travels.  Camel caravans, 4WD trucks and even walking conditions are brought to view with illuminating clarity.  At no time, however, do they resort to personal description.  You are with them, but they aren't directly apparent.  It's an interesting style, one which more authors should emulate.  Photographs and excellent maps are scattered throughout the book, although the quality sometimes leaves something to be desired.  In short, this is a valuable and captivating book  The authors' sympathy and interest in the full range of desert topics enlightens every page.  The bibliography is good but the Index needs a review.  A small price to pay for this fine survey of a vital topic.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]any have perished seeking water's benefits.

The Framers of the Constitution granted the greatest boon given any nation - separation of churches and the state.  Within this framework, religious dogmas have been kept from public school classrooms and American science education is among the best in the world.  However, this foundation has been subject to erosion, increasingly in recent years.  This book was written to stem that decay.<br />A spectre is haunting the classrooms of North American schools, and \\"Eldredge the Exorcist\\" may be the instrument to expel it.  The demon is Christian creationism targeting Darwin's evolution by natural selection.  As Eldredge makes clear, it is Christians, not scientists, who have fostered the science vs. religion \\"wars.\\"  While few scientists eschew spirits as having any role in nature's processes, their beliefs aren't essential to their work.  Christians, declaring their monopoly on \\"morals\\" and \\"ethics\\" still fear that teaching Darwin's natural selection will erode that control.  As Eldredge notes, they have maintained an ongoing campaign to govern the classroom throughout the 20th Century.  Nor, he demonstrates, have the sprinkling of court decisions seriously impaired their efforts.  He calls for readers to uphold the cause of good science education, offering a list of tactics and resources to apply in support of teachers and schools.  And students, if they care to look.<br />He provides an excellent summary of the history and development of thinking about evolution.  From Darwin's original idea through the era of dispute over the role of genetics, to the idea of \\"punk eek\\" he and Gould devised, Eldredge covers a great deal of ground.  A staunch defender of science, he's a good analyst and witty writer.  Readers are not swamped with jargon or arcane ideas.  The presentation is clear, precise and generally well balanced. From the essence of evolutionary thinking, Eldredge takes us on a tour of Christian creationist assaults on Darwin's \\"dangerous idea.\\"  These are pitifully underpinned and often expressed defying analysis.  Christian creationists are at war with science, but Darwin's natural selection in particular.  No tactic appears out of bounds, from misquotes through devious tactics to outright falsehood.  No matter, they say.  This is a question of morality and ethics.<br />Eldredge's summary of why Christian creationists feel the need to campaign against Darwin and carrying their battle into the classroom is excellent.  He alludes to the alliance of Christian creationists and politics as one striving to restore a view [no matter how flawed] of social mores and control.  He also fears the rising degradation of the environment as stemming from Christian adherence to the idea of humans having \\"dominion over the earth\\" granted them by their many Bibles.  He's sensitive to the rapid loss of biodiversity.  Keeping classrooms free of false dogmas is a starting point for saving this planet.<br />There are few flaws in this book, and these are limited to overstressing his own evolutionary theory.  As co-developer [with Stephen Gould] of the idea of \\"punctuated equilibrium,\\" Eldredge gives this idea rather more space than it deserves.  He also surrenders to the impulse of chastising Richard Dawkins with words nearly as harsh as he uses on the Christians.  Calling Dawkins \\"stupid\\" would be hilarious in any other writer.  In Eldredge, it's unforgivable.  That issue will not impair readers knowledgeable about writers of evolution.  Those looking at the issues for the first time, however, may be misled by his vehemence.  Every parent, student, teacher, or school board member should sit down with this book and read it carefully.tionist assaults on Darwin's \\"dangerous idea.\\"  These are pitifully underpinned and often expressed defying analysis.

The event of national self-abuse that sundered the American republic in the 1860s was once relegated to the realm of history.  Horwitz declares that the Civil War/War Between the States has been restored to the status of current events.  With the majority of battles occurring  in the South, this is his venue as he travels from battle site to battle site, recalling, interviewing, reflecting.  Horwitz, an outstanding journalist, has given us a stimulating picture of war as it was and the South as it is.<br />\\"The South is a place.  North, East and West are only directions.\\"  Thus declaims a letter to a Richmond newspaper, summarising nicely Horwitz' findings during two years of touring the former Confederacy.  As a descendent of Russian Jewish immigrants to America, Horwitz, as he confesses, seems an unlikely Civil War \\"buff.\\"  Yet as a child he possessed the ten-volume photographic record of the conflict, read widely in the many works available and awoke one morning to the sounds of battle.  The battle was a modern expression of a group of \\"reenactors,\\" men playing soldiers.  At one point, the constraints of time led to a rapid, exhausting tour of several battle sites in but a few days - a \\"Civil Wargasm.\\"  Following their lead, Horwitz began a tour of former Confederate states which resulted in this excellent volume.  In it he demonstrates how the War Between the States has become a foundation for the resurgence of the Southron identity.<br />Horwitz's earlier career as a war-time journalist in Iran, Bosnia and other conflict areas  provide him with a fine sense of what soldiering entails.  His tours with reenactors and encounters on 1860s battlefields reveal a welcome sensitivity in his accounts.  He joins the reenactors without submerging himself in their artificial existence.  Yet he can sympathise with their feelings in recapturing the sense of history and dedication that many of the combatants felt.  Few were conscripts, and however, ephemeral, both sides felt they were defending a Cause.<br />But this is far more than a recapitulation of military history.  The real value of this book lies in its portrayal of the modern, or \\"New\\" South.  Horwitz examines why there is a renewed interest in Civil War memorabilia and how it is manifested in society, education and politics.  In the Union, the Cause was maintaining the national identity.  In the South, \\"a place,\\" it was the protection of local customs - \\"states' rights.\\"  Once thought to be a dead issue, Horwitz makes clear the notion has returned with new strength.  \\"Big government,\\" \\"affirmative action,\\" and \\"Black power\\" are the same or similar topics fought over at Shiloh, Sharpsburg, or Shelbyville.  \\"The South\\" still reflects a separation of the races, which Horwitz reports as happening by mutual consent in some Southern schools.  Tradition dies hard, and nowhere is the demise more lingering than in the former Confederacy.

The &quot;error&quot; must be identified, then explained and refuted.  For newcomers to cognitive studies, Descartes &quot;error&quot; might seem an obscurity .  Yet it has been the basic tenet of education and social thinking in the Western world for three centuries.  &quot;Cogito ergo sum&quot; was translated into the belief that the mind and the remainder of the body were separate entities.  Behaviour was controlled by the mind, while the body went about its own business.  Damasio demolishes that long-standing mistake for good in this superbly written groundbreaking study.<br />The first indication of the relationship of the mind and body was the bizarre penetration of a railway worker's skull in 1848.  The worker lived, but the damage to his brain left him with severe personality changes.  The case opened the door to research leading to mapping areas of the brain that reflected various personality traits.  Damasio recounts the incident, matching it with numerous clinical studies of his own.  Additional work, some of it strongly innovative led Damasio and his colleagues to a reformulation of how the mind and body interact.<br />He reminds us that the brain is much more than a collection of electrically interacting cells.  The body is sending information to the brain almost continuously, with the brain replying or initiating communication.  These signals are both electrical and chemical.  More importantly, Damasio reflects on the evolutionary origins of these conditions.  For him, it is inevitable that the mind and body interact intimately.  His proposed appellation for Emotions aren't separated from our reasoning processes, but are an integral part of them.  The attempts by parents and educators to &quot;train out&quot; emotions in children are thus doomed to fail.<br />Damasio's thesis hinges on what he calls &quot;somatic markers.&quot;  The markers are areas of the brain which continuously interact with the body, particularly those areas we associate with emotions.  If confronted with emotionally charged choices, the stomach &quot;knots,&quot; the face may &quot;flush&quot; warmly, and perspiration may increase markedly.  These body/brain functions begin developing early in the embryo.  Indeed, they have a long evolutionary history, which firmly establishes their roots.  In humans, the brain not only controls/reacts with the body in addressing stressful circumstances, but retains some level of memory of the events causing the reactions.  Hence, even thinking about such circumstances can lead to bodily reactions associated with them.  You need not be confronting an emotional situation to be able to express the feelings associated with it.  This, of course, is most notably seen in actors or other performers.  Damasio offers the excellent example of orchestra conductor Herbert von Karajan, whose pulse rate was higher while conducting than when confronted with an emergency situation in an airplane.  To Damasio, &quot;Descartes' error&quot; was that he placed all these controls in a central location of the &quot;mind&quot; where, in fact, they are scattered over much of the brain.<br />The implications from this book will be far reaching.  Besides impacting academic courses on behaviour, there will be changes in how we parent, how we deal with education, and even in the realm of law.  Binding reason and emotion will revise uncountable long-standing ideas about how the mind deals with our surroundings.  It is a work addressing fundamental questions about what make us human.  Read it with care, aware that many preconceptions are likely to be challenged.  The rewards for this effort will be great in years to come.

Charles Darwin's &quot;place&quot; in history is secure.  The concept of evolution by natural selection was &quot;the single best idea anyone has ever had,&quot; as Daniel C. Dennett so aptly put it.  Although the idea seems simple, Browne establishes that the man who conceived it was anything but that.  In taking two substantial volumes to depict Darwin's life, Browne reveals the complexity and control hidden beneath his serene outward demeanor.  For many years, Darwin's seclusion at Down House left the impression of the retired, retiring scientific thinker.  On the contrary, Browne shows &quot;a remarkable tactician&quot; manipulating friends,<br />colleagues and, in the final analysis, society at large.  This compelling study is the outstanding work on Darwin.  Her focus on his motivations, activities and other aspects of what made him such a towering figure makes this a remarkable work.  This magnificent study and its companion &quot;Voyaging&quot; will maintain their value as Darwin's pre-eminent account for many years.<br />The pivotal point, of course, is Darwin's 1859 book, The Origin of Species.  Browne recounts the &quot;Wallace letter&quot; which nearly toppled Darwin from the place of priority in developing the idea of natural selection.  Darwin's friends and colleagues rallied to sustain him while maintaining fairness to both him and Wallace.  The many years of study Darwin had given to the concept resulted in the volume that changed our view of life, but it remains an open question whether he would have published without the &quot;thunderbolt from Ternate.&quot;  Browne's view isn't narrow, however, as she places Origin within the broader schema of Victorian writing, whether fiction, social commentary, poetry or science.<br />Browne leads us through the years of turmoil following publication of Origin.  Strangely, she notes, the chief objectors were fellow scientists, not the religious establishment.  Even the British Association debate, often considered the pivot point for making the public aware of the book's meaning, brought out a churchman who had been prompted by one of Darwin's scientific peers.  Although Darwin remained at Down throughout the ensuing years, he maintained constant control of those who spoke for him.  He reached Continental readers quickly, although troubled by freely editing translators.<br />This account portrays Darwin's &quot;place&quot; by almost every definition of the term.  Browne shows Darwin's status among his colleagues, depicts him as a teacher, a father, a member of his community, both locally and in the grander Victorian Era setting.  Darwin was a man of his class, most of which endorsed thinking and speculation.  Most importantly, she shows his stature as a human, at times fearful, courageous, withdrawing, helpful to his friends and scornful of his enemies.  He counseled his children, or used them for help, as the moment demanded.  He sought to protect his wife, but Browne makes clear Emma was under few illusions of the meaning of natural selection.  Darwin was no hypocrite, but was long in reaching his final dismissal of deities.  Whatever the enduring nature of his idea, the man, Browne asserts, still remained a mortal figure.<br />Beyond Origin, Browne relates Darwin's conflicting feelings leading to later works - Descent of Man, plant domestication, orchids, emotional expression and the obscure world of earthworms.  Many of these publications would later prove fundamentally supportive of natural selection.  All required immense amounts of study, communication and writing.  He tended his own plants, studied earthworms at night and used the new technology of phototgraphy.  The variation in topics and methods reflects once again Darwin's genius, but even more his strengths as a naturalist.  Little escaped his scrutiny and he was able to impart his findings with flowing prose reaching a wide public.  All these accomplishments were achieved in spite of frequent illnesses, noneof which were successfully treated.<br />We owe much to Darwin, and Browne has discharged a significant portion of the debt with this book.  The labour of many years, it's an elegant portrayal, worthy of the effort so evident in its making.  Whatever your interests, sit down with this book and meet the man Browne has re-introduced to us.

Two great bastions of Empire have succumbed to Japanese invasions, and Frank's Sydney stands imperiled alone.  As the remaining outpost of Empire, Sydney has become a military crossroads and, if the Japanese haven't invaded, the Yanks have.  They are ubiquitous - on the streets, in pubs, and taking up with Sydney women.  One of these women, a \\"POW widow\\" encounters Frank, setting off a disturbing chain of events.<br />War is busy time for young men - committment, training, combat.  When that young man happens to be a priest, further emotional conflicts needing resolution arise.  Social pressures become intense, with people seeking  solace wherever it can be found.  Frank's confessional has a queue.  He's even more popular than the parish priest - \\"You'll have to put in for overtime!\\", Fr. Carolan tells him.  There's more involved than Frank's light penances.  He feels the need to reach out and bring consolation instead of waiting to be asked.  That leads him to cross parish boundaries in support of an AWOL soldier.  Crossing that line adds further complexity as Frank's confronted with race issues.  Between the temptation of a woman, the startling revelation of child abuse, and a murder, Frank leads a hectic existence.<br />In one sense, Keneally's plot is relatively transparent.  His characters follow predictable paths once they're introduced.  Although not a \\"mystery\\" writer, there's a murder and the \\"perp\\" can be only one character.  With Keneally, this is hardly a shortcoming.  His strength is character development, and whatever your opinion of Frank Darragh, Keneally has portrayed him with his usual finesse.  As with all Keneally fiction, this book ends with the resolution of a moral dilemma.  The impact of that issue has little to do with the plot - it's wholly in the hands of the protagonist.  Keneally's command of language and his ability to reveal inner feelings is unmatched and well demonstrated here.

Most of us were raised with the notion that humans &quot;must&quot; be monogamous.  Often, animals such as swans or foxes were held up as examples to emulate.  Barash and Lipton expose the hollow basis of these examples.  The notion of human monogamy becomes a fragile ideal - nature, and we are part of nature, is anything but monogamous.  In a book combining solid science and entertaining prose, this pair have produced an informal, but information-packed review of new finds in the sexual behaviour of a wealth of species.<br />One small flaw must be dealt with first - sexual behaviour studies must retreat from overuse of the poor screw-worm fly.  The authors cannot resist numerous word plays on the poor creature's name. As the subject of an early attempt at controlling pest populations, the screw-worm fly initiated the host of studies of sexual behaviour among animals.  Barash and Lipton describe sterilization of this insect as largely successful, reducing its population significantly.  Screw-<br />worm flies are monogamous, which reinforced the notion as predominant in nature.  However, a 1970s groundbreaking paper indicated monogamy might not be universal in animals.  From that start a wealth of new studies demonstrated that it was monogamy that was rare, not the reverse.  The screw-worm fly turned out to be a rare exception to the rule, and the basis of comparison for the later research.<br />Bowing to the expected abuse of &quot;anthropomorphising&quot; biology, the authors eschew &quot;adultry&quot; in favour of EPC [Extra Pair Copulation] in describing the common practice in nature.  They show the distinction between &quot;social&quot; and &quot;sexual&quot; pairing.  Social pairing includes nest building, territorial defence, raising offspring and other &quot;family matters.&quot;  Copulation itself, they show, has many more factors involved than simply insemination.  Mates must be available, attractive or both.  Age, health, even &quot;marital status&quot; may be taken into consideration.  And these factors are weighed for &quot;adultery&quot; in animals!  Males might need a special physiology or the ability to prevent EPC, even while seeking to achieve it on their own.<br />As they must, the authors arrive at last at humans.  Noting how difficult research on human sexual behaviour is to document, they cite, albeit with many reservations, several noteworthy studies.  If nothing else, the work proclaims that monogamy among humans is not the &quot;norm.&quot;  In relating the studies, they present anthropological data, surveys of modern societies and clinical studies.  The authors grind no axes and are quick to criticise studies they feel are suspect.  The dearth of valid data, however, leads them to present any plausible suggestion that seems either supportable or capable of further investigation.  Throughout the narrative they insist that no predictable pattern can be applied to humans any more than with the other animals.  Even our closest relatives all retain individuality among their members.<br />A running theme in the book is the authors' call for more research.  How do female blue tits judge the ability of some males to resist winter cold more than others. &quot;No one knows. [Yet]&quot; and similar statements permeate the book.  Anyone fearing there is little in biology left to investigate should read this.  The sparseness of their references certainly supports this plea.

The first is to confound, refute, and rebuke the fatuous critics of sociobiology.  The second aim is to strengthen that nascent science with further research.  Pinker wants us to shed the notion that we have no evolutionary roots for our behaviour - that our actions come wholly from parents, schools or churches.  While that sounds largely reasonable, he continually reminds us that many public pronouncements and policies continue to reflect the mistaken stand.  Otherwise, he argues, we are infinitely malleable, vulnerable to anyone able to direct our actions.  Birth with an empty mind is the ultimate condemnation of free will, not the reverse, Pinker argues.  This excellent work demonstrates how evolution provides a framework for how we think and how our cultural environment finishes the structure.<br />The blank slate view of the mind, along with its fallacious fellows, the noble savage and the &quot;ghost in the machine,&quot; have a long tradition in Western culture.  All three concepts detach humanity from the rest of nature.  &quot;Nature is what we are born to rise above,&quot; said Rose in The African Queen, reflecting, says Pinker, the universality of the triplet in our society.  He urges a more reasonable basis for considering who we are and how we react to life.  Scorning any accusations of &quot;biological determinism,&quot; Pinker doesn't insists nature drives our behaviour.  He merely wants us to bring its impact into clear view.  We've allowed the myths to conceal our real roots.<br />Simply stated, the slate is first written on in the womb.  He outlines the structure of the brain, showing how the embryo's physical growth and the brain's development relate. Given the many brain-controlled operations that are in working order at birth, it seems unlikely the &quot;slate&quot; could be blank.  Pinker stresses &quot;the computational theory of the mind&quot; which places process before content.  The mind, then, is a form of software.  The software comes with birth, but the input varies with different environments.  It's important we understand this, he urges. Every software has built in limitations and constraints.  Pinker contends these limitations are exhibited in every individual in unique fashion.  Groups or cultures, in themselves, don't manifest patterns of these limitations.  Cultural change are simply observed averages, not predictable or inevitable manifestations.<br />Pinker goes on to examine facets of our views of life - politics, gender, children, violence, all  collected under his rubric: &quot;hot buttons.&quot;  He analyses in some detail how our genetic heritage [but, emphatically, not a &quot;gene for . . . &quot;] impacts these topical areas.  More significantly, he indicates how we might address these issues better than we do.  His suggestions aren't even recommendations, but a call for a broader outlook before attitudes on behaviour are expressed.  His discussion of these topics is the real value this book holds for the general reader.  The examples are practical and addressable by policy makers and those who elect them.  The more scientific material in the first chapters of the book provide strong  background for his more concrete examples further on.<br />Pinker is under no illusions that his ideas will be implemented quickly, nor will they fail to be targeted by those still holding to &quot;the modern denial of human nature.&quot;  That mind-set is the reason he is very clear in pointing out where research is needed.  He recognizes where resistance will arise and meets it effectively.  He explains the tactics and reasoning of those who deny human nature has a biological basis, and counters with excellent examples and suggestions.  That he is able to achieve this with such lucidity is refreshingly welcome.  Anyone with children should read this book.  Anyone who's been a child should read this book.is a form of software.

He undermines the policies that have protected corporations for over a century.  Legally protected today, corporations were long subject to general suspicion.  Government charters to operate a business contained many constraining clauses that are now missing.  How and why did this change come about?  Should government constraints be restored, and if so, how would be brought about?  Hartmann presents the history, issues and solutions to the growing corporate takeover of the global commons.<br />He opens by reminding us that the &quot;commons&quot; once represented a village pasture, shared by all.  In modern times he argues the same concept embraces the entire planet.  The sharing implies common sense be applied to its use.  We are beginning to understand our planet is &quot;the commons&quot; for all humanity.  Every human has some rights to that commons, but shares a responsibility for its well being.  That set of rights and responsibilities is set by the community as a whole, not by any one individual.  The community concept, however, is based on the idea that its members are essentially equal.  The corporation, due to its amorphous structure and unique powers has gone beyond community ideals.<br />The history of corporate power rests on continued attempts to upgrade an &quot;artificial&quot; entity to a &quot;natural&quot; one.  Hartmann traces the erosion of that ideal through this book.  An early chip was taken when Queen Elizabeth I granted Francis Drake &quot;freedom from liabilitie&quot; to go pirating.  It was an omen for the future.  Although the Framers of the Constitution of the United States were vociferous in their resistance to corporations, events pushed their ideals aside.  In a rapidly developing economy and to confront European competion, corporations arose and grew.  As they grew, they sought not only protection from State taxation, they sought to further their ends by political action, something nearly all governments restrained.  After many tries, they seemed to have accomplished it in 1889 during a court case over the collection of property taxes.<br />Hartmann details the events surrounding the case, pointing out that the corporate &quot;victory&quot; of achieving &quot;personhood&quot; is spurious.  It was not part of the decision and added as a post judgement note.  He suggests that railway lawyer Stephen J. Field likely influenced the writing of the notes by court reporter John C.B. Davis.  The victory for business interests virtually turned the 14th Amendment to the Constitution on its head.  Business now had the same &quot;rights&quot; as any naturally born human - privacy, investment, political activity and right to trial.  Where a state issuing a corporate charter previously had the right to withdraw it for improper activity, a corporate existence was now sacrosanct.  Given the vague nature of the corporation, &quot;improper behaviour&quot; could punish individuals, but not the corporation's<br />existence.  Hartmann explains how this condition has led corporations to invade the global &quot;commons&quot; with impunity, ravaging nature to acquire resources and markets.<br />People often ask &quot;if corporate dominance is so bad, what will you replace it with?&quot;  Hartmann states &quot;the suggestion i'm putting forth in this book is to try democracy.&quot;  The solution is simple enough - a return to Jeffersonian principles.  That doesn't mean a regression to an agrarian society.  It means, instead, a restoration of democratic practices - the raising of humans to their natural place of dominance over artificial entities.  He encourages local communities to begin redefining their laws to reflect the concept that corporate organizations are not people.  Once that precedent is established, the democratic ideal can be restored by revising laws and constitutions up through the political hierarchy.  From communities throughthe states to the national government.  He stresses that while there will certainly be resistance and scare tactics, enough popular pressure can restore those lost ideals.the states to the national government.

From Ankh Morpork, he arrives at the Agatean Empire on the Counterweight Continent, cushioned by a snowbank.  Those studying Auriental history [knowing where the gold is] will recognize the failed wizzard is entering an alien environment.  Luckily, familiar faces emerge.  The first is the Discworld's most revered barbarian hero, Ghengiz Cohen - who is accompanied by some geriatric colleagues, the Silver Horde.<br />Rincewind isn't a tourist in the Agatean Empire, as Twoflower was in Ankh Morpork.  He's been sent for in the midst of a political crisis.  A dying emperor, five families contending for power, a revolutionary cadre and a mythical army must all be brought together to make this story work.  Oh, yes, plus the Horde and Rincewind.  Who else but Pratchett could seamlessly weave all these elements together?  And keep you smiling with the turning of every page?<br />Yet, as usual, Pratchett does even more.  He can maintain a balance between a reflection of ancient and modern China [sorry, Agatean Empire], bring forth a string of fascinating personalities and turn an impossible situation into reality without missing a beat.  At the same time we are given a dose of chaos theory, familiar images of today's world politics and some philosophical images of the universality of human nature.  For an added touch, something you won't see in any other \\"fantasy\\" novel, Pratchett's astute perception allows him to resurrect the 6 000 terra cotta warriors found in a tomb in China and have them march again.<br />The combination of Pratchett's wide-ranging knowledge, his ability to depict personalities - even though we'd prefer not to know a few of them - and the keen wit that keeps you delighted as you read is nearly overwhelming.  He makes the writing look so easy as he leads you along the convoluted logic of Agatean politics, the irreverence and dedication of the Horde - who manage to ignore calendars, logic and the ongoing desperation of Rincewind's life.  Pratchett is a practiced craftsman.  Whatever your politics, whatever your philosophy, Pratchett is certain to offer new challenges and fresh ideas.  Read, delight, and read again.

Herman tears down a few misconceptions about the Scots as he rebuilds their image as original thinkers and practical achievers.  Herman is not the first to consider John Knox as the taproot of the Scottish expression.  Knox's Calvinist severity, however, often clouds the fact that the Scots severed from the Catholic church only a generation after Henry VIII achieved that for England.  And they accomplished it without the power of a monarch.  Herman sees Knox's thinking as planting seeds leading to a flowering of democratic ideals.<br />These ideals weren't lofty theoretical flights, however.  In an excellent summary over two chapters, Herman outlines the Scottish Enlightenment and the men who created it.  Unlike the Continental Enlightenment, the Scots version had a deep religious base.  They sought their deity through rational investigation, searching for its expression rather than pushing it to a distance as did the Deists.  These Scots saw &quot;the proper study of mankind&quot; as a practical question leading to social betterment.  Education became a universal in Scotland at a time when most schooling remained under the cloak of religious authority.<br />Herman contends the Act of Union as of immense benefit to Scottish society at many levels.  The chief result was the elimination of prejudicial economic policy.  As long as they remained independent, the Scots were unable to compete with English mercantilists.  While many Scottish nationalists see the Act of Union as a subversion of local values, Herman, along with many Scots, view it as providing new opportunities.  He stresses the opened doors to trade led to rapid enrichment of the port cities of Scotland and world-wide contacts.  Ships meant shipbuilding and many Scots later brought their talents to the New World resulting in the speedy clipper ships.<br />Herman follows the exodus of Scots around the globe - North America, Australia, India.  Each place they entered, they left a mark.  Most of it seems positive today - strong commercial enterprise, extending education, uplifting political ideals.  Herman paints a glorious picture, deftly omitting a few blemishes.  His descriptions of the Highland clans verges on the romantic, but fails to note their signal of the burning cross emigrated to become the image of America's Ku Klux Klan.  Scots driven from their home lands resulted in many becoming the slave overseers of the South's plantations.<br />These are minor points.  The scope of Herman's book, as he states, is global, both physically and intellectually.  He has assembled a wealth of material, presented it forcefully and cogently.  There's much more to deal with here than simply learning something [more?] about the Scots.

An imposing book by a major science writer, Tudge rightly subtitles this work &quot;a celebration.&quot;  Although at first glance the book seems overwhelming, Tudge has broken down his feast of life into easily consumed portions.  After an excellent overview of the history of classifying life, he allows the reader to choose among the many types of animals and plants.  One can jump to insects, birds, fish or reptiles for more detailed evolutionary accounts and modern examples.  Unable to resist, i skimmed over a few more esoteric examples to settle down to Primates and Hominids.  This section provides a superb overview of current knowledge, distinguishing clearly what is known and what is supposed.  This was familiar territory but delving in the other sections proved equally rewarding.  However, this also suggests a warning that the book is not a &quot;cover-to-cover&quot; exercise.<br />Tudge opens with the problem facing many new students of biological sciences - how to deal with the immensity of information confronting them.  There are, he notes, over two million species described already.  No-one disputes the number is far below the actual total life contains - but what is the realistic total?  Estimates range as high as 100 million - an almost inconceivable figure.  He accepts the more likely total as around thirty million, recognizing that such numbers remain out of human ken.  From this, he builds his case that classification systems are necessary.  What's required is a classification method that anyone can grasp.  He finds the solution in the idea proposed by German entomologist Willi Hennig - cladistics.  This system arranges life by characteristics, avoiding confusing generalities and the arcane mysteries of genetics.  As Tudge argues, cladistics has become fourth phase of classification systems, and the one likely to endure.<br />The &quot;technical&quot; sections of the book, covering the multitude of life forms each open with a descriptive essay followed by a &quot;tree&quot; of relationship among various species.  This structure makes the book an excellent reference work and will keep it valuable for many years.  The illustrations are designed to impart general information, not scientific detail.  Neither are they simplistic as the supporting comment provides pointers to consider when viewing them.  Tudge groups the text and graphics nicely, allowing visual and text comparison without constant page flipping.<br />As with any author confronting the immense cargo of information available in biology, Tudge was forced into a selective process in creating a bibliography.  It's not an enviable task.  The list appears sparse, a heavily pruned tree arranged by chapters.  He indicates his preferred references, but only by using his sources will you discover whether more bountiful reading is listed in them.

A novel idea even now, Jaynes proposed that until about 3 000 years ago, the human mind was sharply divided - a &quot;bicameral mind.&quot; One part dealt with the normal daily occupations of survival and reproduction. The other part was a conduit for communications with the gods. Jaynes portrays the brain's structure and how it might generate &quot;hallucinatory&quot; voices and images that were construed as supernatural. Not until the civilization of Greece was well advanced did the consciousness we're familiar with arise and partially replace these hallucinatory visions. The pivot point, in Jaynes' view, is the distinction between the Iliad and Odyssey.<br />According to Jaynes, these two epic poems are qualitatively distinct, with the Iliad expressing the voice of the gods, but the Odyssey shifting to the voice of men. He makes bold assertions, &quot;there is no general consciousness in the Iliad&quot; - presuming the reader has accepted his definition of &quot;consciousness.&quot; He dissects the poem in demonstrating it presents only the voices of the gods. By the conclusion of his analysis you may be convinced that if there really is such a thing as &quot;genetic determinism&quot; it certainly resided in the brain of humans who went through life without a single &quot;conscious&quot; expression. The brain created and imparted signals that could only be discerned as &quot;divine.&quot; &quot;Will&quot; was absent. &quot;Creativity&quot; is missing from this analysis, although his sections on poetry and music make compelling reading. All was not lost for human beings, however. Conscious today, Jaynes finds in Homer's next poem the sign the evidence of its emergence. In the Odyssey, the humans take over the job of expressing their own destinies, leading to the expansion of consciousness through the remainder of history.<br />To accept this thesis, one must accept the idea that such human feats as irrigation systems in the Tigris-Euphrates civilizations, the Egyptian pyramids and even navigating the Mediterranean Sea were driven by hallucinations - &quot;gods&quot; imparted the means of these accomplishments. Jaynes urges this notion forcefully, citing examples in other societies such as the Aztecs or Incas of the Western Hemisphere [He ignores Asian societies utterly]. Even poetry and song, according to Jaynes, were actually the &quot;voices&quot; of hallucinations produced by the bicameral mind. The evolution to the &quot;subjective&quot; mind was rapid and clearly consequential, but Jaynes is unable to provide the mechanism of the transition.<br />Jaynes' proposal still generates discussion and assessment. Since tracing the evolution of the bicameral mind is inherently impossible, his proposal can never be verified. This book did, however, generate many studies. For that reason alone, this book remains a valuable contribution to cognitive studies. Whatever its shortcomings - the &quot;reading in&quot; of historical evidence, the over-precise time frame, the narrow European view, the bizarre speculations, don't invalidate the proposal of how the human mind evolved. No-one studying the mind and its development can afford to overlook Jaynes' contribution.<br />- Review by stephen a. haines, Ottawa, Canaday.<br />To accept this thesis, one must accept the idea that such human feats as irrigation systems in the Tigris-Euphrates civilizations, the Egyptian pyramids and even navigating the Mediterranean Sea were driven by hallucinations - &quot;gods&quot; imparted the means of these accomplishments.

What prompts some American scientists, avowed evolutionists, to engage in ardent Darwin bashing?  Steve Gould tried it and failed miserably.  Richard Lewontin is still at it, with even less success.  Niles Eldredge acknowledged he thought it would gain him \\"exposure.\\"  Lynn Margulis has joined the pack, attempting a direct refutation of Darwin's idea of evolution by natural selection.  In her view, natural selection plays only a minimal role in the story of life.  Instead, like Gould, she demolishes not only \\"Origin,\\" but all those scientists adhering to its tenets, as well.  It's an ambitious programme, but like that of her accomplices, doomed from the outset.  As with her confederates, the demise is from self-inflicted wounds.<br />Extending Margulis' earlier thesis that cellular organelles were the result of symbiotic relationships, the authors attempt to make \\"symbiogenesis\\" replace natural selection.  Symbiosis reflects two organisms existing together and mutually dependent.  Like Lego pieces they may enjoy individual identity which changes when they're assembled.  Margulis and Sagan stress that symbiosis is far more prevalent than a fungi and algae forming lichens on rocks.  With many vivid examples, such as green slugs that never eat or a marine organism that \\"shoots\\" predators with bacterial ribbons, they stress that the ubiquitous nature of symbiotic relationships \\"proves\\" gradual evolution by genetic variation is misleading.  Instead, they propose a saltationist approach - new species can be formed as rapidly as the symbiotic relationship is stable.<br />Margulis derides Darwinist scholars for focussing on extinction, even going to the extent of counting the synonyms for \\"death\\" in Darwin's Origin.  Arguing that natural selection doesn't \\"create\\" new species, she further contends science has never demonstrated the emergence of a new species.  She scorns the work of Peter and Rosemary Grant in the Galapagos [featured in Jonathan Weiner's \\"The Beak of the Finch\\"] as failing to demonstrate evolution of new bird species.  Margulis cannot seriously expect the emergence of a new bird in two decades of study.  However, since she contends symbiogenesis can be achieved in a single generation, such extravagant demands aren't surprising.  Although she suggests environmental pressures can force symbiotic relationships to emerge, she rejects the notion that these same pressures can winnow life to leave survivors as a new species in the changed circumstances.<br />While the book is an informative and provocative read, Margulis and Sagan spend nearly as much time ranting about the failures of Darwin and Darwinists as they do presenting evidence for their thesis.  As with many polemicists, the authors erect the occasional straw man.  In this case, as advocates of Eldredge and Gould's \\"punk eek\\" concept, they assault any aspect of sociobiology targetable.  Among other false claims, they contend sociobiologists assert altruism among individuals is \\"monitored.\\"  Overzealousness leads them into the occasional blunder, claiming that genes don't produce cells because cells are mostly protein.  The job of all genes is to express proteins.  Finally, as they have done elsewhere, the pair insert a lengthy support for Lovelock's Gaia thesis.  In this case, the section is an abrupt non-sequitur providing no relevant information supporting their thesis.<br />There's no question of the authors' prose abilities.  They present a wealth of new information on microorganisms, all of which makes compelling reading.  In too many cases, however, there are few or no references to sources.  The assertion that certain mushrooms possess \\"thousands of genders\\" may be old news to biologists, but it was a first for me.  Yet there is no citation for this information.  The illustrations are interesting, but poorly tied to the text.  In short, this book presents numerous challenges and topics for further investigation.  Margulis and Sagan may have outlined how themethods of natural selection may be expanded, but they have hardly replaced Darwin's original thesis with this effort.he methods of natural selection may be expanded, but they have hardly replaced Darwin's original thesis with this effort.	2003-02-12

Given the amount of dreck published about this book over the past two decades, it seemed a worthwhile exercise to reread and comment on it for a new generation of readers.  As with Darwin's Origin of Species, more people have commented on this work than have read or understood it.  Dawkins is a superb writer, able to convey his ideas with clarity and wit.  As he has stated elsewhere, however, those very ideas still challenge those whose minds are locked by preconceptions.  Dawkins must be, and is, a staunch advocate in presenting to us what genes are all about.  He does so in order that we better understand ourselves.<br />He begins by anticipating the outcry of those who must see humans set apart from the rest of life.  &quot;Why Are People&quot; examines several behavioral aspects of animals and people.  Altruism receives particular attention because the term &quot;selfish&quot; applied to life returns us to the concept of nature &quot;red in tooth and claw&quot; which he wishes to avoid.  Genes are not conscious entities who make decisions about their existence or future.  Genes are simply replicators, using whatever resources are available to make more of themselves.  With luck, the environment in which they do this allows them to survive and continue replicating.  If not, the gene, and whatever characteristic it represents, goes extinct.  Enough bad matches and a whole species follows the gene into extinction.<br />In the beginning our very earliest ancestors weren't likely to even have been organisms, but simply chemicals.  From this, Dawkins traces the development of the DNA molecule and the organisms that came to carry it in their cells.  These organisms, &quot;survival machines&quot; in Dawkins' expression, carry the genes, supplying them with the raw material to continue replicating.  It's a discomfiting idea to many to be brought face to face with the idea that they are but &quot;gene machines&quot;, but Dawkins shows us in crisp prose that this is simply how life works.  Because animals, particularly human animals, seem to exhibit &quot;purpose&quot;, there is ongoing objection to the idea that actions can be gene driven.  Dawkins explains that genes have had more than three billion years to develop survival techniques that give the<br />appearance of &quot;purposiveness.&quot;<br />The apparent display of purpose is covered through much of the book in his discussion of &quot;game theory&quot;.  Game theory applied to life has moved well beyond simple win or lose situations.  Game situations now involve highly complex interactions in which the players don't win or lose, but survive where possible.  Players don't reach a terminal finish through their activities, but reach a modus vivendi.  Parents, particularly mothers, sacrifice to bear and raise offspring.  Plants, deprived of an optimum niche, adapt to occupy another, less desirable one.<br />Finally, in what might prove to be the most telling innovation in this book, Dawkins introduces a new descriptor of social behaviour: the meme.  The revolution in thinking about why humanity performs some wholly illogical actions has only begun.  Ideas, habits, faiths, characteristics that humans like to think separate us from the other animals, arise and replicate just like their biological counterparts.  They form, replicate, find a suitable environment and continue replicating.  Susan Blackmore's THE MEME MACHINE, is a must companion to this volume with its full and penetrating examination of this aspect of life.<br />Dawkins' critics are loud and vociferous.  It would be pointless to assess motivation in their continued diatribes against this book.  Darwin was forced to weather the same type of criticisms for just the same reason: their ideas jerk the pedestal of divine origins from humanity.  Even trained scientists find it difficult to shed the concept that because humans have achieved so much, their origins must transcend pure biology.  Dawkins' critics nearly all descend to the pejorative, labelling him and his adherents, &quot;Ultra-Darwinists&quot;.  Few phrases are as meaningless as this one.  How one can be &quot;beyond Darwin&quot; eludes definition.<br />This book is a fine starting point in understanding how life, particularly our form of life, operates.  It should be standard classroom fare, both in biology and philosophy classes.  If you didn't encounter it there, buy it here.  Read it carefully and closely.

Jolly's basic thesis is that the portrayal of evolution as \\"red in tooth and claw\\" is overblown.  Species survival requires at least as much co-operation as competition.  There are continuous compromises made in nature, each of which is as likely to aid in survival of the participants as elimination of opposition would.  Jolly isn't attempting to replace competition as the root of evolution so much as temper it.  The tempering force is sex.  Always a subject of mystery among biologists, the origins of sex remain shrouded in mystery.  Only the legacy of its inception becomes clear in hindsight.  Sex provides genetic variety and a melange of social orders among animals.  According to Jolly, sex generates interactions between individuals and groups that likely wouldn't have arisen otherwise.<br />Jolly argues that the interactions have led to various forms of altruism.  In turn, the social \\"games\\" needed to maintain co-operation and altruism have generated higher levels of intelligence.  Co-operation requires communication, further stimulating intelligence.  This is most clearly manifest in the primates, particularly humans, of course.  The rise of sociobiology [deemed \\"evolutionary psychology\\" by the timid] has added fresh pointers to our natural origins.  Jolly is adept at equalizing the contending forces in this field and fending off its more strident critics.  In one chapter, she expresses admiration for the growing number and influence of women scholars in the field.  She then spends time gently dissecting a \\"deconstructionist\\" view of primatology, her own field.  Her balanced views and reasonable approach are among the more admirable aspects of this book.<br />Her narrative style is light and conversational.  There are even personal asides to keep the presentation from becoming rigid or pedantic.  Regrettably, her desire to reach many readers and avoid axe-grinding led her down an unfortunate path.  She sprinkles poetry samples throughout the text, many of these of doubtful value to the narrative.  Her choice of illustrations is even worse.  In charity, we might blame this on faulty editing.  The topic is far too important to distract the reader with empty non-sequiturs.  She imparts the importance well, but erodes it with these asides.  The importance is maintained when you reach her References.  This is an admirably complete source list and repays a careful look.

At issue is the aim of the &quot;new left&quot; to displace the values established by the Enlightenment, replacing them with &quot;politically correct&quot; ideals.  These ideals include &quot;feminist studies,&quot; multi-cultural values, and various forms of &quot;text analysis&quot; asserting culture drives scholarship.  These new ideals have crossed the Atlantic from their home among modern French &quot;philosophes.&quot;  Kimball argues these ideals have taken root and spread firmly throughout North American universities.  They are eroding the traditional aims of universities to teach critical thinking, replacing that with slogans and a political agenda.<br />Kimball identifies the &quot;Western canon&quot; - the establishment of a hierarchy of valuable works of literature, history, critical studies based on value.  That canon is represented by works of what the British refer to as &quot;the Greats.&quot;  While conceding that the membership of these &quot;Greats&quot; is Eurocentric, he counters that the Enlightenment has been successfully exported around the world.  It is not the writers or critics themselves that have been received successfully elsewhere [although that's often the case], but the methods and values from the Enlightenment that have gained ascendancy.  In contrast, the new &quot;postmodernist&quot; thrust seeks to abandon not only the people representing the canon, but the very methods of thinking and writing that gave rise to it.<br />Recognizing that the movement asserts it is making academia more &quot;democratic,&quot; Kimball argues that in scholarship, democracy isn't a replacement for merit.  Why, he asks, should a student &quot;place Shakespeare on a par with Bugs Bunny&quot;?  Characterising the rise of deconstruction as an &quot;intellectual spree&quot; he mourns its nchallenged wide acceptance.  He goes on to present numerous examples of the thinking [or lack of it] expressed by its advocates.  The items range from magazine editorial policies to convocations of educators planning curricula.  Perhaps the most jarring note is his description of the impact of deconstruction on architecture.  Although that seems almost humorously self-contradictory, Kimball provides valid examples.<br /><br />His presentation is passionate, perhaps even alarming to the unwary reader.  A strong advocate of traditional Western ideals, Kimball sprinkles the work with his aversion to Marxist tenets.  If the book has a serious shortcoming, it is that blatant political orientation.  Since this book was published, other surveys have appeared.  None have truly replaced this seminal work in examining the pronouncements of those setting the academic agenda today.

Life has offered too many distractions for him to pause and reflect.  Cruz Smith has drawn him as a man seemingly devoid of values - opportunist, womanizer, manipulator.  If Harry was truly that simple, we would be unlikely to follow him through his complex life or along the twists of Tokyo's back alleys.  The son of Baptist missionaries, his childhood allowed him opportunity to become virtually Japanese.  He played &quot;the 47 Ronin&quot; with schoolmates, keeps his living quarters impeccably Japanese, when even his neighbours maintain a &quot;Western&quot; room, has a Japanese lover and is fluent in the language.  He even addresses a businessmen's club extolling Japan's desire to oust Western imperialists from Asia.  But he knows war is imminent, and he's keen to know the initial target.  It's his mission.<br />Smith presents a story deeply researched and fluently expressed.  There's never a dull moment, even during the flashbacks to Harry's youth.  He becomes a hustler early, attracted to the &quot;floating world&quot; of Tokyo's theatre, art and gambling circles.  These many facets of underworld life gain him entrance to a wide cross-section of a society distrustful of &quot;gaijins&quot; - foreign barbarians.  Harry encounters Tojo, plays poker with Yamamoto, watches the con of a scientist looking for military support, and money.  On the other hand, there's the nagging sensation that Harry has another agenda.  He has suffered much at the hands of Japanese, and will endure more if war comes.  He tries to maintain his &quot;cool&quot; even at the expense of dignity.<br />The modern &quot;thriller&quot; is only mildly concerned with characterisation or even plot.  Harry becomes Cruz Smith's vehicle for showing off his research.  That's not a fault, but the unprepared reader can be overwhelmed.  Smith has detailed prewar Japanese life, both civilian and military, high and low, to an amazing degree.  He understands the theatre, woodblock art production, military attitudes and the impact of America's embargoes on pre-war Japan.  In a surprise flash, Cruz Smith even dredges up Archbishop James Ussher's pinpointing the date of the onset of the Biblical Flood.  He uses this point to give Harry the edge in a gambling dispute.  Now that's research!<br />Books such as this are an escape.  You tuck away your reservations about what's plausible and let yourself sink into the narrative.  Turning pages to encounter the next episode, you are caught up in events right along with the protagonist.  If the writer is skilled, as Cruz Smith certainly is, distractions are rebuffed as you follow the adventure.  Only after the last page is closed do you sit back to consider whether the book reflects any level of reality.  No matter.  If the author has kept your mind captive through his tale, he's accomplished what he set out to do.  Sink yourself into this book.  Ignore the little quirks of impossibility and enjoy a fine story.

Capra traces the growth of networks ranging from the minute life functions established in the earliest cells through to today's global economic organizations.  Asserting that life's origins began with fat globs providing a base, cells could then develop compound structures by absorption of chemicals or other, smaller, organisms.  Biological patterns were expanded, not changed, as evolution progressed through time.  Complexity increased opportunity for life to inhabit new niches and adapt more readily to change.  Capra embraces the \\"Santiago Theory of Cognition\\" which expresses evolution as a recursive process.  \\"Thinking\\" about adaptation to changing environments leads to new lifeforms.  With the process established across all life, he's able to toy with Lovelock's Gaia thesis, adding fresh ornamentation to the idea of the biosphere as a single organism.<br />Capra weaves a picture of humanity as tightly threaded with the rest of nature's tapestry.  Our composition, our habits, our creations are entwined with all other living things.  He insists we must recognize our integration with the rest of the biosphere.  He offers a novel mechanism to achieve that awareness.  Past science has focussed too narrowly - a habit he decries as \\"reductionist.\\"  He urges the creation of a \\"new type of science dealing with qualities rather than quantities\\" a proposal emitting the aroma of some of the recent \\"post-modernist\\" philosophers.<br />In the second part of the book he addresses some of the human-designed mechanisms.  Human structures are complex, even paradoxical, he argues.  Our organizations carry a \\"dual nature\\" - the mechanistic drive for profit running in parallel with the community of humans who have personal needs to fulfill.  These elements are essentially conflicting and many compromises must be made to achieve both ends.  The effort also results in \\"two kinds of leadership,\\" those with the drive to create and those protecting human values.  The extension of the \\"creators\\" has given us \\"globalisation\\" while the \\"protectors\\" are struggling for recognition and acceptance.  Today's striving for a global economy is the final extension of the biological networking process - only its aims differ.  Almost as a sidelight, Capra sees globalisation as having created a new, almost parallel economy in the formation of a world embracing \\"crime economy.\\"  This bizarre force operates in parallel with \\"legitimate\\" business ends, although using similar mechanisms.<br />In order to cope with all these forces, Capra wishes us to foster his \\"new type of science\\" to gain further acceptance.  Unfortunately, the first step is the major weakness of the book.  Having already given us a biology resting on shaky assertions, he goes on to create a structure of straw.  A whole section of the book rails against the sin of \\"genetic determinism.\\"  This is an outmoded and false concept, except to those who wish to attack science.  Capra uses the term as a bludgeon to attack the failures of the \\"green revolution\\" and the promises of biotechnology.  These are valid targets, but the weapon is flimsy.  It's almost a non-sequitor when set against his view of corporate operations.<br />Capra's reliance on weak weapons is furthered by the limitations of his sources.  His reading list is sparse, to say the least.  He's chosen a few like-minded philosophers, but there is little in the way of serious scientific input.  Given the scope of this book, that's regrettable.  The edifice he's built is timely.  We need to know more about nature, not just as \\"environment\\" but in the details that might provide more insight.  Unfortunately, the many loose bricks in his structure tend to shake his credibility.  If his work was more informative and less polemical, especially when he attacks targets he doesn't identify, there might be more reason to admire the grandeur of his construction.  Instead, we must turn elsewhere for better material.  Since the \\"quality\\" he seeks remains elusive, we must make new bricks of real data.  His architecture is admirable, but the construction must be of firmer components.  E.O. Wilson provides a more stable foundation.seeks remains elusive, we must make new bricks of real data.

The utterance reflects the marred midnight entrance of this newcomer when he slips on an ice patch. He is an \\"anthropomorphic personification\\" - a traditionally spiritual figure in [almost] human form. The outburst is in all CAPITALS because that's how important he is on the Discworld - he's Death. We've met him briefly in earlier books, but this one brings his personality to view, and reinforces Pratchett's stature as an imaginative writer.<br />Death's job is not to kill, that role belongs to Fate. Death simply harvests the results of Fate's decisions. No Pratchett character, however, is ever \\"simply\\" anything. Death is far more sensitive than legend would have us believe. He \\"GETS REALLY UPSET\\" at the drowning of kittens, while rejecting any thought of \\"fairness\\" - there is no fairness, \\"THERE'S ONLY ME\\" he declares. While apparently contradictory, these comments reflect the complicated events surrounding the job.<br />Since the role is complex, Death has decided to take on an apprentice to help sort things out. Mortimer, or Mort, isn't as simple as he first appears, either. Mort, still seeking fairness, is sent out on his first solo. His first \\"take\\" will keep you smiling, if not guffawing. Mort's human origins [we don't know Death's] are a pitfall for an apprentice. He fails at completing an assignment, with unforeseen results. What would the cascade of events be if someone who was supposed to die, didn't?  Pratchett examines this delicate issue in very human terms - challenging us to examine our traditional values. He provides a laugh at every step along the way - either in how the characters react to the situation or just through his descriptive powers. No matter - the underlying question remains there for us to cope with.<br />Many mainstream critics push Pratchett into a niche, trying to minimalize his value.  \\"Humorous fantacist\\" is the usual insulting label, one that both misses the mark and reflects the reviewer's superficial reading.  His readers, even if only subliminally, recognize there is more in his work.  Unlike genre \\"fantasy\\" writers, Pratchett doesn't offer a means of escaping reality.  Instead, he thrusts it before your eyes, forcing you to consider how you mean to confront it.  He manages this without the harsh approach of philosophers or pedants, keeping you smiling as you reflect on his offering.  But reflect you will.  If you don't, go back and read him again.

"	With this hint Robert Buckman opens a valuable study of the roots of human belief.  He goes on to discuss how these roots become expressed in forms of behaviour.  He deftly sidesteps the question of whether gods exist, instead explains the roots of faith as reaction to natural mysteries.  Deities, then, are things surpassing human experience or explanation.  Buckman defines them as \\"external intelligence\\" - what we don't understand we attribute to outside causes.  The causes become \\"supra-human\\" - forces outside our ken, but useful, particularly when we give them identities.<br /><br />Early societies used this foundation to establish \\"animism,\\" a \\"primitive\\" [he doesn't like the term, but it's \\"useful\\"] form of religion.  Animism then evolved by reducing the number of spirits attributed with the powers of nature.  In our society, this number was finally reduced to one, an All-Powerful One.  This winnowing was accompanied by the establishment of a hierarchy to interpret phenomenon for the remainder of the populace.  Shamans/priests became the explainers of divine edicts, often able to direct the activities of the entire society.  Every unusual phenomenon required interpretation and this circumstance still leads to the establishment of \\"new religions\\" such as the \\"cargo cults\\" amongPacific Islanders today.  \\"Faith\\" is a highly dynamic social force in Buckman's view.  These aren't new ideas, but Buckman's summary in opening the book is among the better efforts.<br /><br />Buckman accepts that the human \\"need to believe\\" is an immense force.  In his chapter on \\"Worship\\" he examines the social and individual expressions of who and what we revere.  He uses Thomas Carlyle as an example of the idea that heroes [and deities] are born, and not thrown up by circumstances - \\"the man makes the times.\\"  To Buckman, Carlyle's ideas fit admirably with the notion of gods emerging from nothing, commanding attention and respect.  Myths and legends grow relating their behaviour and these become teaching tools applied to the rest of society.  The result is the establishment of \\"Function and Value\\" of belief. These are essentially the comforting aspects of belief - explaining the unknown with understandable stories that become tradition.  Why should Hitler and Napoleon have become successful against all reason?  They provided living legends accepted by a wide spectrum of the populace.<br /><br />Why are these anomalous figures and their mythologies so readily adopted as illustrious?  Buckman moves on to an enlightening discussion of what happens in our brains to make these circumstances seem real or desirable.  He cites the work of one English and two Canadian researchers in the brain's functions.  Based on work originally done to explain the workings of epilepsy, Wilder Penfield and Michael Persinger have demonstrated how easily the brain can be fooled into simulating various types of feelings, from well-being to outright visions.  These emotions are tied in with operations of the right temporal lobe, and may even be generated by the body's internal chemistry.  While they are all individual responses, the patterns appear to be nearly universal.  If they occur associated with outside events, the subject readily equates the feeling with the incident.  Gods, myths, heroic figures and legends readily become associated.  The temporal lobe, according to Buckman, may be the place of origin for our beliefs.<br /><br />Buckman thus concludes that an enhanced understanding of the source of many of the emotions and behaviours associated with belief can redirect how and what we believe.  By dissociating our \\"normal\\" values and ethics from an \\"external intelligence\\" we can focus more directly on our own resources in establishing these social mores.  The Golden Rule, he argues, is an excellent basis for human behaviour.  We need only recognize that it is a human value to follow and not a divinely inspired one.<br /><br />Buckman's overview of the elements of faith and behaviour should be required reading in every church and school.  As an avowed humanist, Buckman's thesis reflects his belief that humanity can make rational decisions.  He offers an excellent collection of readings to supplement his contentions and to assist those seeking ideas on how to implement a more rational society.  It can be done, and reading this book is a giant first step in achieving a society devoid of misdirected faith.reading in every church and school.

Like attending the wizards' school, the Unseen University.<br />This third Discworld novel takes us to the other aspect of that strange place's magic environment, the feminine side.  PTerry introduces us to someone who will later loom large in the Discworld pantheon, Esme Weatherwax.  Granny Weatherwax is the resident witch of Bad Ass and takes up the task of teaching Eskarina the role of how witching works through the use of headology.  Granny's not a charlatan, but she knows the value of belief and spurns the cheap tricksterism so often manifest by the wizards.  Eskarina's powers are too apparent for either of them to control effectively and Granny's forced to send Eskarina to the only place where that control can be learned.  By various and adventure-filled paths, Eskarina arrives at the University, thrust almost inadvertently into a bizarre new world.<br />Esk's outspoken claim to \\"want to be a wizard\\" brings on the confrontation between tradition and The Century of the Fruitbat.  Times certainly are a-changin' but for Esk they only become worse for some time.  She's given into the care of the University's housekeeper, Mrs Whitlow, and quickly becomes a figure out of Dickens.  Sweeping floors isn't what she had in mind, even if she can direct the broom to do the work while she sits in a corner pondering life's injustices.  Yet her powers develop, to the point where she's forced to confront the Things from the Dungeon Dimensions, the greatest threat the Discworld faces.  It's an even match.<br />Pratchett's characterizations are always more valuable than any of his story lines, and this early work is no exception.  Eskarina's a forceful girl with modern views, even if she's writ a bit young for the role.  Although this book ends a bit weakly, the story's message is valid and needs expressing.  As always, Pratchett attests that the Discworld is a \\"mirror of worlds\\", especially ours.  Eskarina's plight is too common for PTerry to ignore and he presents it clearly and honestly.  That he can add his sparkling wit in conveying his ideas is a added blessing for us.  Put this next to Colour of Magic and Light Fantastic with assurance that you will pick it up again.  His works never age, but remain a joyful read for years to come.ings from the Dungeon Dimensions, the greatest threat the Discworld faces.

They are necessarily incomplete, usually being but pointers into a richer past.  They trigger memories which quickly dominate your awareness, pushing aside the memorial.  A writer's monument is best done in a book using his unknown or unpublished material accompanied by the usual accolades.  This book follows the standard pattern, with several testimonials bracing Adams' own work.  It's a successful application of the formula.  Necessarily, it's incomplete.  Adams was too gigantic to be portrayed in a limited collection - only a definitive biography will achieve that.<br />In structure, the book follows one of his titles, being sectioned into \\"Life,\\" The Universe,\\" and \\"And Everything.\\"  \\"Life\\" is his - from the irony of born with the initials DNA only months before Watson and Crick explained the structure of the molecule [and both at Cambridge!] through school years in short pants, to marching to Kilamanjaro in a rhino costume.  The why of the march has eluded too many readers.  In \\"The Universe\\" we encounter Adams' expanding world.  Unlike some writers, he dotes on computers.  The Internet opens doors to exciting new places and to further inspire his writing.  His \\"rabid atheism\\" is queried, and his forthright responses should be required reading for many people.  Although it truly belongs in the \\"Life\\" section, the essay \\"Cookies\\" demonstrates Adams' humanity as strongly as anything he's written.  Then, in \\"And Everything,\\" some fiction emerges, including a sketch on a young Zaphod Beeblebrox.  Zaphod's moral roots are exposed as are some of our own.<br />A potential Dirk Gently novel, under this book's title,  is provided as the concluding portion.  Dirk Gently was Adams' mechanism for examining life as Hitchhiker's was for looking at science.  Adams, like his contemporary Terry Pratchett, defies categorization.  He didn't write \\"sci-fi\\" although that's where you always find his books.  Dirk Gently's stories aren't \\"fantasy\\" although some pretty fantastic things occur.  Like Pratchett, Adams uses his stories to display his insight into the human condition.  Again, like Pratchett, Adams presents these reflections with captivating wit.  Dirk Gently novels are never fully snared in one reading, and even this partially finished effort rewards your return.<br />The Foreword advises you not to \\"bolt this whole\\" by reading it in one go.  Heed that advice.  It's all good medicine, but it tastes even better in small doses.  Others have rejected the advice and quaffed SoD to their discomfort.  But if you sample bits a little at a time, even randomly, you will be properly introduced to one of the great humourists.  Whether you are new to Adams or a dedicated fan, there is good fare here.

Dominating the legends are the traverses of European explorers in the region.  Among these legends, that of Burke and Wills retains a lofty status, one Sarah Murgatroyd may have forever toppled.  She has given the tradition of explorer heroics a strenuous airing with this book.  Few reputations are left unsmirched, but her real assault centres on the incompetence of the expedition's leader, Robert O'Hara Burke.<br />The author relates how Burke left Melbourne, Victoria, in 1860 with several ambitions,  muddled instructions and devoid of capabilities to manage the task.  Behind his straggling team were a cabal of businessmen intent on extending Victoria's borders.  Beyond that, they also hoped to initiate a telegraph line route to Asia, thence to London.  In competition with Adelaide to the west, both cities had sponsored expeditions to traverse the continent from south to north.  Others had made the attempt, but the travails of crossing a land intolerant of blundering had thwarted them all.  Burke was aware of a major competitor in the figure of Charles McDouall Stuart who had nearly succeeded before turning back.  Burke, among other things, saw the enterprise as a race - which he intended to win.<br />Murgatroyed demonstrates how that aspect, among others, doomed the expedition from the beginning.  Burke's undue haste led to launching the trek at the worst time of year.  He quarreled with subordinates, sacked members of the team and scorned delays occasioned by scientific studies.  His fatal error was in dividing the group, ultimately leaving most of his companions behind to make a dash to the northern sea.  It was the fragmenting of the expedition that led to conflicting priorities and delays.  In the end, not able to actually observe the sea, three survivors of the dash north returned to the rendezvous point to find the word &quot;Dig&quot; carved in a tree.  It wasn't enough to save the two leaders surviving the journey.<br />In analysing Burke's actions, Murgatroyd contrasts them with others, some having set out to rescue the lost venturers.  As she points out, the business leaders of Melbourne enhanced the already general view that the only thing considered more &quot;heroic than a successful explorer was a dead one.&quot;  Melbourne now had two in Burke and his subordinate William Wills.  The legend of their heroism was almost manufactured by those who'd sponsored the expedition.  The hagiography surrounding the pair has persisted in strength for over a century.<br />Murgatroyd dispels that idolatry effectively.  She cannot be faulted for viewing the past with modern eyes as some are led to do.  As a journalist's account, the book is not footnoted, although she provides a good reading list.  Her style is open and forthright, keeping the reader close to the events related.  She speculates but little, and her judgements are conveyed in sharp contrast.  Various persona are portrayed in scathing terms.  Even those driven by events escape but narrowly.  Her account will dismay some, but none sink into ennui.  Her rendition of a complex story makes excellent reading.  Her loss to journalism is severe.e journey.  <br />In analysing Burke's actions, Murgatroyd contrasts them with others, some having set out to rescue the lost venturers.

Science has been under severe assaults during the past generation.  Much anti -science feeling arose as a reaction against the use of science and technology to support war.  Later, science was accused of supporting racism and sexism.  Now, as this book makes clear, a new wave of slander on science has arisen and is gaining strength.  The origin of these assaults began with the wave of \\"postmodernist\\" writings among French philosophers and social commentators.  The attitude of science being merely the tool of society instead of working aloof or apart from social issues leapt the Atlantic to take firm root among North American academics.  This \\"academic left,\\" having begun as a movement for social equality, has turned its wrath on science.  Nearly every element of science, from relativity to biology, has come under the distorted scrutiny of humanities scholars.  Alan Sokal's fictitious example in Social Text demonstrated just how contorted this outlook can be.<br />After an excellent presentation of \\"postmodernist\\" concepts, the authors address the anti-science critics declarations.  The authors offer us a rogues' gallery of misguided \\"spokespersons\\" who bend language, misinterpret what science discloses and the methods it uses, and who fail to comprehend the very topics they purport to critique.  They accept that much of science seems obscure and eludes quick or superficial comprehension.  Why then, they query, do these critics insist either on denouncing its methods or adopt the findings in an attempt to restructure society?  In Gross and Levitt's view, the critics see attacks on science as a means of attaining intellectual power and guiding society along a revised path.  Since these critics see corruption at every level, they mean to \\"purify\\" society by tearing out any and all roots supporting it.  That they have been effective at this slashing exercise in many areas is the reason this book was written.<br />Gross and Levitt show that those condemning science as \\"patriarchal,\\" environmentally destructive or racist, are almost universally devoid of knowledge of the workings of science.  These attackers seek to replace traditional science with new \\"ways of knowing.\\"  Gross and Levitt offer some real howlers as examples of this genre.  From the frivolous \\"Newton's Principia is a rape manual\\" to the bizarre notion of a \\"feminist algebra,\\" Gross and Levitt expose the fallacies of these \\"anti-patriarchal\\" constructs.  Given the long term campaign by feminists to rebuke science, they show remarkable restraint in their assessment of this aspect of post-modernist techniques.  The chapter \\"Auspiciating Gender\\" is but seven pages longer than the next longest one.  Still, as they remind us, those adherents to such grotesque notions are now firmly established in academic positions and making education policies.<br />Throughout the book, the authors remind us that science is \\"a reality-driven enterprise.\\"  Science achieves its results by constant attention to methods and results.  Whatever impact \\"culture\\" has on science, it isn't in the methodology.  No reputable scientist assumes his theories will go unchallenged, especially as new data emerge.  The cycles of checks and confirmations or refutations has kept science moving forward since the Enlightenment.  Gross and Levitt urge readers to remember that without the methods and results of science, countless human achievements from the elimination of smallpox to the computers viewing this page would never have occurred.  In the words of Richard Dawkins, \\"show me a cultural relativist in a jet aircraft at 35 000 feet, and I'll show you a hypocrite.\\"  What more can be said?tive at this slashing exercise in many areas is the reason this book was written. <br />Gross and Levitt show that those condemning science as \\"patriarchal,\\" environmentally destructive or racist, are almost universally devoid of knowledge of the workings of science.

Margulis and Sagan return us to the days of life's inception.  It's a journey in time and scope, travelling far back and down in size.  Looking at the microbial world might seem unrewarding, but they escort us through a rich trove of information.  The knowledge  contributes to our understanding of how we work.  Although mysteries remain hidden in that distant time, the authors clearly demonstrate the logic of how early life has developed into ourselves and our animal and plant neighbours on this planet.  The title suggests that the journey must necessarily occur at high speed, but they demonstrate that if we don't appreciate  the beginning the remainder of the trip will be undertaken in obscurity.  A better knowledge of the origins, they suggest, will also give us better insight into what the future heralds.<br />After some preliminary discussion of how life started, the authors move into the realm of cellular organisms.  The various ideas of life's origins are fascinating, but not until it achieved the level of individual micro-organisms does life take on meaning.  The authors describe the events occurring during the long reign of the prokaryotes.  These simple organisms were little more than a bag containing some genetic information.  Yet, their emergence was the start of true life.  While it's easy to think this \\"primitive\\" organism has faded into oblivion with the passage of time, the authors remind us that all our bacterial neighbours [and some inhabiting us!] are of that distant family.<br />When conditions varied in certain localities, these simple creatures performed some amazing tricks.  One of these resulted in a devastating event the authors term The Oxygen Holocaust.  The original prokaryotes thrived on hydrogen, making useful compounds of it and other elements.  Since the best available source was water, the resultant waste product was oxygen.  As this pollutant entered the atmosphere many organisms were forced to change their lifestyle or die out.  The massive changes resulting increased the complexity of many organisms that began adding new protective devices to their structures.  According to the authors, some cells had already initiated a new survival technique - the merging of various prokaryotic cells resulting in a new type.  The new cell packaged its genetic material in a nucleus, creating the form known as the eukaryotes.  Eukaryotic cell structure led down the long evolutionary track to complex creatures like ourselves.<br />There is a goal behind their descriptions of life's evolution.  They remind us that textbook illustrations of individual bacteria are misleading.  All Bacteria \\"clump\\" in some form or another as part of their survival strategy.  Because these tiny organisms encounter so many environments and because their genetic makeup allows astonishing variation, many bacteria form communities with various groups performing specific tasks.  These roles may include shielding the rest of the community from environmental hazards, processing food and waste or mobility.  This revelation also points up a major theme of this book - cooperation has played a greater role in evolution than has competition.  Cooperation is a survival strategy whereas competition may leave too few winners to ensure perpetuation of the species.  How far can the cooperation extend in a planet of highly varying environments?<br />That question is answered in their concluding chapter.  In it, they extend their previous narrative to reinforce the case for James Lovelock's Gaia thesis.  In their view, Gaia is a \\"superorganism\\" extending throughout the entire biosphere.  It is self correcting and self-regulating - indeed, the role of evolution is but the \\"operating system\\" of this global organism.  Since the oxygen we breathe came from waste-expelling microbes, more than lifeforms are contained within Gaia.  The atmosphere and oceans aren't habitats and support systems for life, but an integral part of a grander structure, one thoroughly integrated.  One can only wonder what Darwin might have thought of this extrapolation of his idea of evolution by natural selection.  This is not the place to debate Lovelock's thesis.  While Gaia has been strenuously challenged by other commentators, Margulis and Sagan weave a tightly knit support for the idea.  They do it earnestly and with clarity, and their view should be given some consideration.  Strangely, however, while they have no qualms about describing certain theories about life's evolutionary progress as \\"still a mystery\\" or \\"controversial,\\" this aspect of the book is presented as a given.  The inconsistency is glaring, but shouldn't detract from the worth of the book as a whole.roughly integrated.

Apart from being mis-titled for North American readers, this is a mind-expanding view of &quot;what's out there&quot; - or might be.  Released as &quot;Evolving the Alien&quot; in the UK, this book examines numerous and too often poorly considered suggestions about how life might evolve in other places.<br />Note &quot;places,&quot; since Cohen and Stewart don't limit their conjectures to planets alone.  Noting the impact of H.G. Wells' &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; as a starting point for how we think about life elsewhere, Cohen and Stewart divide the book between evidence from hard science and the conjectures of &quot;SF&quot; [speculative fiction] authors.  Including themselves.  In their view, both exobiologists and novelists have been remiss in considering how alien life might evolve.  They do a comprehensive job, presented with the kind of wit expected of collaborators of Terry Pratchett of Discworld fame.<br />Recognizing they are entering a relatively unexplored area, they abandon old terms like &quot;astrobiology&quot; or &quot;extraterrestrial life&quot; to suggest a new, all encompassing term - xenobiology.  They condemn outright the narrow views expressed by some scientists, notably Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee in &quot;Rare Earth.&quot;  Cohen and Stewart argue that limiting life to DNA-based forms is far too restrictive.  Different environments are capable of producing life in ways &quot;we can't even imagine.&quot;  Magnetic fields in suns or neutron stars, silicon-based chemistry, unusual energy uses are all part of the panorama nature has in its recipes in making life start.  Our localized experience is too limited, they argue, and we should look further with more open minds.<br />Those who have attempted a more open view have traditionally been limited to writers of speculative fiction.  Cohen and Stewart sprinkle the text with examples of this genre, accompanied by an analysis of what is right or wrong with the ET life presented.  &quot;Science fiction&quot; might just as easily be labelled &quot;fictional science&quot; in the eyes of these authors.  Too little attention has been given to environmental complexity by the legions of writers seeking to entertain readers with simple plots and much action.  Among that phalanx, however, there are some writers who strive to bring reality to the fictional worlds they create.  Jack Cohen has been called into the story-building process as a consultant by several authors.  The result, once the dust had settled, was SF with a reality check.  The authors give accounts of some of<br />these efforts and the resulting books should be sought out and compared to those less favoured by the authors of this book.<br />Jack&amp;Ian [as they style themselves] have provided a rich trove of ideas for nearly everyone.

What an ordeal the authors of this book must have endured in researching the material for it!  Even wading through the snippets and samples used to illustrate their arguments is a mind-warping exercise.  Describing the phenomenon of \\"postmodernism\\" as \\"nebulous Zeitgeist,\\" they expand on the definition with characteristics of postmodernist writings.  These elements are abuse of scientific terms and use of meaningless terminology, offering empty opinions on how science works and its impact on society.  Manipulating science for philosophic ends might be considered harmless, if it was but an ignorant assault on the discipline alone.  Instead, the deconstructionist view wants the whole of society to reconsider its roots in their lights - it is an intellectual revolution.  Unlike other revolutions, however, postmodernism is purely destructive having no discernible aims.<br />The authors make a sincere effort to limit their diagnosis to a limited scope.  They avoid judgment on the philosophies in general.  By offering lengthy original quotes, countered by an analysis of the scientific principles clumsily interpreted by the PM writers, they invite readers to arrive at their own assessment.  The reader is given brief but informative passages on the scientific topics in support of this exercise.  It takes, however, a dedicated reader to wade through the morass of \\"profound prose\\" the PMs have conceived without querying its fundamental validity.  What is interesting in their presentation is the focus on French sources.  In this approach, they attack the contagion at its source.  A diagnosis of its infection among North American academics isn't presented.  That has been done elsewhere.<br />Yet the authors understand that the postmodernist movement has strong adherents in North America.  This reaches far outside the university community to reach government policy makers, educators at all levels and even the business community.  Among educators, postmodernist impact on feminist thinking has outstripped its role in other humanist issues.  Feminists may not address specific scientific topics as such, but are given to broad sweeping statements castigating half of the human species.  Luce Irigary is given much space in this book due to her outrageous assertions and her impact on North American feminism which adopts them gleefully.  Sokal and Bricmont, in their conclusion, see this resulting in a violation on educational standards.  It is, in truth, a raping of young minds.  This book, then, is a sharp warning to those who force artificial standards on behaviour and school curricula.  Read it, difficult as the postmodernist passages are, with the intention to look at the issues further.  They are before you now and require action.  It is your children who will benefit from what Sokal and Bricmont have offered.thinking has outstripped its role in other humanist issues.

Plot and characterization must be developed in minimal space, depicting enough to be definitive, yet complete in a few pages.  Some writers handle this constraint better than others.  Stephen Henighan's response to the confinement is handled in various ways, some more successful than others.  The collection of eight short stories cry out for expansion, yet are fully complete in themselves.  This apparent contradiction is a complement to Henighan's skills as a writer, not confusion on the part of the reviewer.  With one exception, the stories are fascinating reading, with excellent characterization.  The stories are complete and don't leave you hanging - except where that is the intention.<br />The initial story in this collection is a post-modernist attempt to convey the world of the elderly.  The value of Henighan's imaging is nearly overcome by his technique.  Sixteen pages to impart the stresses in Sophie's long life - all in a single paragraph.  The lack of break forces the reader to find a way to pause at arbitrary places, then try to pick up the story thread.  This method almost inevitably leads the reader back a few lines - an incredibly fatiguing experience.  Yet, of course, this is precisely what Henighan wants - by the end of this brief undertaking, which seems to last far longer than it actually does, you are as weary as is Sophie herself.<br />The title story relates the life of a social worker in Guatemala during one of its many political upheavals.  Isabelle is beset by heavy demands on her time and energy.  Her loneliness in an isolated town is palpable, but she mines her personal resources for nuggets of spiritual fuel to continue.  The odds are formidable, but she finds means to sustain herself through the crowded days.  A gringo enters her life, adding to the complications.  The resolution leaves the reader shaken and sympathetic.<br />All Henighan's stories have left him exposed to the charge of &quot;expropriating voice&quot; - the adoption of cultures, gender, locales that aren't &quot;native&quot; to the author.  Henighan's writing skills absolutely refute such silly accusations.  &quot;Political correctness&quot; has no place in good literature, and Henighan's images of times and places not his carry no tinge of falsity.

Only Hope remained to support people.  Humour is Hope's offsider, without which Hope is only grim determination.  There's nothing grim in this collection, granting the sole exception that so many of the &quot;dated&quot; pieces display a disturbing timelessness.  Thurber's 1933 article on Mr. Preble and Frank Sullivan's articles from the same era are examples.  No matter, this collection from The New Yorker spans time, topic and technique with enough variety for any reader.  Broadly divided into such subject areas as &quot;Spoof,&quot; &quot;Words of Advice&quot; and, my favourite, &quot;The Writing Life&quot; the assembly of wit can be approached from almost any direction.  The editors caution you not to read it cover to cover, - &quot;put yourself on a diet&quot; - but such advice is unwarranted.  The variety of the chosen selections passes you from one piece to the next without choking.  Within the topic areas the essays are chronologically arranged.  Knowing that, you may chose an area and read at random.<br />A collection as large and varied as this necessarily lacks universal appeal.  Tastes in humour vary as widely as in religion or politics.  Groucho Marx is mostly unknown in this generation, but on stage, TV and here in print, displays why he was revered as a comic for many years.  On the other hand, Remnick and Finder let Steve Martin convince them he's funny.  Others remain to be convinced, but his inclusion in this collection still is justified.  There is more than just the issue of generations involved.  &quot;Classical&quot; humourists abound here, James Thurber, E. B. White and Robert Benchley.  From the same era, however, Upton Sinclair would seem an intrusion - until you read &quot;How to be Obscene.&quot;<br />As the chronology of each section progresses, it's clear that much of today's humour varies from early styles.  Garrison Keillor is not really funny, but offers light-hearted philosophy in his submissions.  Veronica Glen's &quot;My Mao&quot; can only be described as feeble, but is characteristic of the sort of humour the Cold War often evoked.  Woody Allen's &quot;Kugelmass Episode&quot; lifts the tone with a whimsical fantasy published in the same year.  Selections such as these point up that the collection is of &quot;humour&quot; and not &quot;comedy.&quot;  The distinction may be thin, but the editors have shown how deftly they have chosen when reviewers here assert the humour is &quot;head&quot; humour and not &quot;gut&quot; humour.  Comedy is &quot;gut&quot; humour.  &quot;Head&quot; humour suggests reflection and offers an alternative, and often plausible, version of real life.  Many of the pieces here provide just that inspiration.  Allen's fantasy of Kugelmass presents an update of Thurber's &quot;Walter Mitty,&quot; showing how ageless this type of humour can be.<br />It's impossible to review this collection without commenting on the final piece.  Notes on the typefaces are normally of interest only to printers and other publications specialists.

A \\"reffo wog\\" [immigrant from Southern Europe] in Tasmania, he lives a disenchanted life.  His taxing job is meaningless, his quarters squalid, his friends and co-workers equally hopeless.  His wife, Maria, has disappeared into a blizzard, leaving him with three-year-old Sonja.<br />Bojan's grief at the loss of Maria is compounded by memories of his early years.  As a young Yugoslav partisan messenger, he witnessed war in all its viciousness.  These aren't the fond childhood recollections of most of us.  In Tasmania, he confronts the realities of immigrant life - exploitation, scornful neighbours, reduced status and few opportunities.  A lesser man might cave in under such pressures, but Bojan is a tough bloke.  Being tough, however, makes him neither happy nor successful.  He survives with the help of the bottle, all the while expressing his resentment at the vagaries of his life.  Some of that resentment falls, as it must, on Sonja.  She represents the missing Maria.<br />Maria Bull's fading into a snowy Tasmanian night triggered dark guilt in Sonja - which she carries through her life.  Their shared grief doesn't bring Sonja and Bojan closer.  His drinking and violence only compounds Song's sense of detachment.  She withdraws, although the spark of affection for Bojan never quite expires.  Fleeing to Sydney, Sonja tries to shed the past, living the present intensely.  Her grief is little assuaged as she uses a succession of men to compensate for, in effect, the loss of both parents.  The ember of regard for Bojan dims feelings she might hold for another man.  Cruel, drunken, cynical as he is, Bojan remains the one solid aspect of her life.  It is to this lodestone she returns at last, in an attempt to take charge of her life.  If \\"it is written,\\" she determines at last to do her own writing.<br />Reviewing Flanagan inevitably evokes the tired clich&eacute;s - \\"powerful\\" or  \\"intense.\\"  While both terms apply, neither sufficiently addresses the quality of Flanagan's writing.  One phrase, rarely applied to today's writers is \\"clarity.\\"  Although the story of Sonja and Bojan Buloh is told through broken chronology, Flanagan is able to hold the reader's attention throughout the tale.  Skipping from present to past in a narrative is too often a distraction, but Flanagan manages the feat with unusal precision.  Given the depth of feeling presented, he deserves high praise for his accomplishment.  His story disturbs, sometimes repels, the reader, but the tale is never false nor the events contrived.  His writing contains no cliches, nor is it tired.  Only the reviewer is guilty of those sins.resses the quality of Flanagan's writing.

The path is often vague and indistinct, but Schopf is a sure and eloquent guide.  Not only has he traversed the route before, but he's helped select and clear the track.  This fine book reflects Schop's lighthearted &quot;trailside&quot; manner.  He fully enjoys scrutinising the rocks for early lifeforms, and the enjoyment is infectious.  It's a pleasure to accompany him on this journey.<br />Of all the ideas of the origins of life, none proved more exciting than the experiments of Harold Urey and Stanley Miller.  Their zapping of elemental chemicals to produce amino acids seemed the final answer to how it all began.  Years of criticism of their work and assumptions led to the acclaim fading, but Schopf here attempts to resurrect its primacy.  His argument relies on his findings of evidence of wide-ranging shallow seas - Darwin's famous &quot;warm, shallow pond&quot; as the place of life's origins.  Schopf argues these seas were present at the same time simple life-forms emerged.  In Darwin's time, the techniques for analysing the early rocks were limited.  Today, as Schopf demonstrates, looking in the right place with the proper tools brings rich paleontological rewards.<br />After tracing the histories of several researchers in Pre-Cambrian fossils, Schopf goes on to illustrate the most recent finds and their significance.  Some of the finds are beyond the realm of the rocks alone.  His description of the process of polymer formation illustrates the beginning of complex chemistry leading from non-life to life.  The distinction, as he notes, has become vague as research from many disciplines has been applied to evolutionary studies.  As life progressed, it developed such talents as use of light energy, self-perpetuating activities, and the emergence of metabolism.  He explains these processes in quite readable prose, but also depicts them with fine illustrations.  It's a rare combination of multi-level presentation.<br /> Schopf's tour takes us not only into deep time, but deep space.  At the end of the book he examines the issues surrounding the &quot;Martian meteorite&quot; which was suspected to contain remnants of life on that planet.  Schopf was the lone dissenter in NASA's presentation of the likely presence of micro-organism fossils.  His disappointment in the presentation and the hype surrounding the proposal is keenly expressed.  One of his proposals in this book is the universality of life's roots.  Lifeforms of some level are almost inevitable on other worlds, given the necessary conditions.  He argues the components are available throughout the cosmos, needing only the proper environment to start evolving.  It would be exciting to detect evidence of past life on Mars, but meteorite ALH80001 didn't provide it.them with fine illustrations.

Complex life developed from the merging of microbial forms of life.  Elements of the cell such as mitochondria, chloroplasts and other organelles came from small, simple lifeforms invading larger cells.  The idea was a long time in gaining acceptance, but is now part of conventional evolutionary texts.  In this book, she expands her earlier work with some accounts of her life as a scientist and wife of Carl Sagan.  She also goes beyond her earlier work to advance a new thesis on the accelerator of evolution - sex.  While many of her ideas are presented in more detail elsewhere, this book is a good, quick introduction to fuller accounts of her thinking.<br />Margulis is an innovator - forceful in imparting her ideas.  She portrays herself as a rebel from early in her career, arguing here that she was sceptical of \\"genes in the nucleus determin[ing] all the characteristics of plants and animals.\\"  Her misgivings received scant support, however, without a replacement thesis.  She found one in symbiosis - the association of multiple organisms.  It took many years of investigation, including initial rejection of her attempts to publish, before the idea of SET [Serial Endoymbiosis Theory] found acceptance.  So much attention had been focussed the DNA in the cell nucleus that organelle structure and function had been essentially overlooked as irrelevant.  That these organelles might have been independent organisms at some point was too novel.  Her account of the struggle to gain recognition is related as one of dogged persistence, nearly devoid of outside support .<br />Moving through an interesting discussion of life's origins, she dismisses the notion that forms of nucleic acids arose before simple cells.  She finds the natural occurence of lipids [fats] as the more likely precursors of complex life, with RNA and DNA arising as a way to give these fat globules more survival ability.  As with her earlier thesis, this one will generate controversy, something Margulis seems nutured on.<br />Her proposal about the emergence of sex will come as a surprise to most readers.  In a word, she suggests sex resulting from cannibalism.  In Margulis' view, certain microbes under stress, notably the absence of food, turned on each other for survival.  The cannibalism was not always fully consummated, she suggests, but the beginnings of mixing genetic material was begun in the process.  Incomplete cannibalism could lead to the formation of a new, more complex organism.  If this process occurred often enough within a compatible group, the new organism, obviously larger than its predecessors, would be more fit to compete.<br />In conclusion, Margulis makes a strong case in favour of James Lovelock's Gaia concept.  This might have been a non-sequitor in the hands of someone less able to deal with novel ideas.  Margulis stresses that Gaia has been mistakenly viewed as Earth's biosphere acting as a single organism.  She argues that Gaia really means a global network - a \\"system of organisms.\\"  The Gaia concept means the elements of the \\"system\\" are tightly entangled and extinctions weaken the structure.  If the extinction rate exceeds the rate of recovery the system is endangered.  It's interesting to note in light of her definition that the Gaia website still refers to it as a \\"superorganism,\\" not a \\"system of organisms.\\"  This disparity doesn't detract from Margulis' presentation, which is admirably presented.  She offers enough graphic support for the text to clarify or enhance her themes.  In all, this is a fine mind-opener in thinking about the development of early life.

He offers a Francophone, a Japanese-Canadian, a Canadian-Jamaican, an Ojibway, a Neanderthal, multiple universes, and a rape - all in the first 80 pages.  He uses well-established credentials in converting science, albeit speculative, into fiction.  He has achieved a high point with this book.  Incorporating geology, paleoanthropology and quantum physics into this story, he makes a fantastic situation both credible and readable.<br />In this first volume of a trilogy, physicist Ponter Boddit disappears in mysterious circumstances from a deep mine physics laboratory.  Ponter, however, is not of this earth.  He is of an \\"advanced\\" Neanderthal society in an alternative universe.  Homo sapiens has apparently gone extinct in his world, but Ponter emerges in a world where that \\"extinct\\" species dominates.  Sawyer uses the need for Ponter's adjustment to his novel environment to examine many aspects of our society - its values, beliefs and practices.  Communication is enhanced by Ponter's possession of an electronic implant that \\"learns\\" words and derives meaning from context.  It's a cunning ploy, reflecting a measure of desparation to move Sawyer's other ideas along more readily.  He further suggests the Neanderthal's brain capacity could mean greater intelligence, even an enhanced moral sense.<br />The story itself isn't complex.  What happens in Ponter's world to account for his disappearance, and what must he do to adapt to the one he's in?  The circumstances surrounding these issues give Sawyer the opportunity to minutely examine and contrast the two societies.  People in the world Pondar left prove very \\"human\\" in their motives and behaviour.  Although their society is drastically different, their emotions and interactions are vividly familiar.  In this world, the characters are forced to examine their history and beliefs, appearing rather shallow in contrast to the Neanderthal milieu.  In fact, the two primary characters are of the Neanderthal, not our, world.<br />If the plot is thin, the ideas considered and discussed are not.  He asks us to consider many alternatives.  The most important of these, of course, is how our society is structured.  Can our way of life be improved?  Sawyer suggests it can, particularly in how we deal with nature and one another.  Most importantly, he sees change deriving from our own choices, removed from false values derived from metaphysics.  Unlike many of Sawyer's other books, we are not led down some devious path to accept deities.  Even the origins and structures of the paired universes are perceived differently by their inhabitants.  Both are perfectly plausible in light of today's astrophysics.  Better, Sawyer is able to address these issues with a fine prose style and concern for the reader's comprehension.  The next volume will be welcomed warmly.e Neanderthal, not our, world.<br />If the plot is thin, the ideas considered and discussed are not.  He asks us to consider many alternatives.

When the name &quot;Tim Winton&quot; graces the cover, however, a pause to reconsider inevitably follows.  Winton's ability to draw characters and evoke imagery has few peers, and he doesn't disappoint here.  That the theme is as old as literature and well shopworn fails to erode the quality of how Winton presents it.  The triangle here looks a bit unstable - two long, extended sides reaching from a narrow base.  The two major sides are Georgie Jutland and Lu Fox.  The base is Jim Buckridge, firm and strong in his Western Australian seaside community.  His role as base gives him more presence in this unusual tale than might be expected. Winton gives him more presence than ink.<br />Georgie has been looking for a strong foundation, both emotionally and geographically.  She's been in Arabia, America, the West Pacific, all the while seeking some unrecognized resting place.  And someone to rest with.  Jim's position in the town, his successful fishing operation, and the family stability of two sons [he's a widower] seemed ideal to Georgie.  She's been with him for three years, and the ideal image has washed away with the tides.  Georgie feels she's on the deep sea - &quot;overboard . . . with nowhere to swim.&quot;  Itching to leave, yet with nowhere to run, any excuse becomes plausible.  The reason she finds is perfectly convincing to her,  yet seems specious to anyone not suffering her malaise of spirit.  She needs &quot;somewhere to swim,&quot; but her sense of direction is missing.<br />The only buoy to grasp couldn't be a worse choice.  It's Lu Fox, the town's blacksheep.  Fox, among his other failings, is a poacher.  In a fishing community there could be no worse label.  Fox also carries an overwhelming burden of grief.  That burden is tempered by his needs, which Georgie, alone in the village, perceives almost immediately.  Her discovery comes too late as Lu's poaching is revealed and retribution is taken.  Lu, in a way possible only in Australia, &quot;goes bush.&quot;  He disappears from White Point and very nearly from human ken.  The loss forces Georgie into decisions about her life, and this time, with unexpected support, she pursues them with vigour.<br />Winton's powers of imagery and imagination are outstanding.  A multi-prize winner, he has justifiably earned an elevated place in the pantheon of current writers.  He captures the minds, hearts, lives of his characters with unerring talent.  We follow his matchless depictions with a mix of sympathy, horror and fascination.  The story is skillfully woven around them.  While they may seem out of control at points, Winton guides us through the shoals of their disordered lives like a storm-tossed pilot.  The effect demonstrates his surety at conveying feelings of many types and expressions.  These are not &quot;simple&quot; seaside folk - their lives, no matter how imaginary, bear telling.  Winton has told their stories, for there is more than one, or even three, here, each in their individual voice.  It takes a special talent to shift writing styles within a story without losing the reader.  As with any Winton book, this one is worthy of repeated reading.

While Horwitz' prose is light and easy to take, there are deep messages in this book that require some pause for contemplation.  The sub-title reflects his desired market - he, like Star Trek's  Gene Roddenberry, wants us to move beyond merely the superficial.  Horwitz takes us on a dual quest - who was James Cook and what resulted from his fantastic voyages?  In answering those questions, Horwitz both delved into an imposing stack of references and followed [mostly] Cook's path around the world.  From this solid foundation comes a serious attempt to convey the life and times of the British Empire's primary guide interspersed with reflections on the impact of global imperialism.  Horwitz brings light into a shadowy history,  keeping us interested and informed along his journey.<br />James Cook remains relatively obscure, having been overshadowed by Nelson in British eyes and by Columbus in America.  Recently, new appraisals of Cook have appeared although few can match this account.  Horwitz uses a novel approach, keeping the book's chronology his own, beginning in the West Coast of North America, which was Cook's third voyage.  This account doesn't even really end with Cook's death in Hawaii, but continues with Horwitz' quest to identify possible Cook relics in Sydney, Australia.  Between that opening and the unfinished analysis of possible Cook body parts, Horwitz takes us to Pacific tropical islands, the frigid Aleutians, the Yorkshire moors and foggy London town.  At each stop, Horwitz' journalist skills are employed to probes locals' reactions to the Cook legend.  The reactions vary even more than the people themselves.  Cook, it seems, attracts feelings from adoration to vilification.<br />Years of travel as a journalist have given Horwitz superb powers of observation.  He's able to convey his feelings without detracting from his campaign to impart Cook to our attention.  Add to this an exceptional historical sense and we are given today's environment  within a deeply structured framework.  He even manages to gain an interview with the king of Tonga, a unique achievement.  These talents seem to fail him in the choice of travel companions.  Roger Williamson trails along with Horwitz, frequently carping about the conditions, travel arrangements, and lack of \\"crumpet\\" [women].  Roger's own travelling companion, \\"Percy,\\" remains confined in his pants during the journey, achieving marked success at the end.  Roger and \\"Percy\\" lighten many severe moments in the book, but don't distract from boredom - there's not a boring moment in the book.  Except, perhaps, the tedium of Roger's whingeing.<br />Horwitz examines Cook in depth.  His analysis of what drove the navigator to three incredible voyages, why he was revered by his crews, indeed, what behaviour led to Cook's death in Hawaii, is the equal of any professional academician.  Cook's humble beginnings were subdued by an intense ambition, expressed in feats none of his day or later could match.  When, after the successful H.M.S. Endeavour voyage, Cook might have retired in glory.  Instead, he took the first opportunity to again voyage into what Horwitz calls Cook's Pacific Kingdom.  Horwitz reminds us that Cook travelled toward both Poles, extending humanity's view more than 140 degrees of latitude.<br />Most travel books offer maps and Horwitz doesn't skimp here.  The maps convey Cook's tracks instead of the author's, detailing the important parts of the Pacific voyages [the Newfoundland mapping years are ignored.]  The best, however, is saved for last.  Unlike most travel books, Blue Latitudes includes a fine essay on the published sources he researched.  He is highly laudatory of New Zealander John Beaglehole, but offers material by Cook critics in a balanced set of essays.  A good bibliography and index finishes this exceptional book.  Among its many virtues is that its value will besustained for a long time.be sustained for a long time.	2002-12-16

"	There are constraints to Australian road travel - the chief one being that the cities, hence, the roads, hug the coasts.  There are dangers, desolation, loneliness, above all, heat.  And flies.  It takes some courage to face these conditions alone, even in modern times.  Tony Horwitz faced them alone and on foot - some of the time.  The result was a fantastic voyage and a superb account.<br />Horwitz is an unlikely prospect for an Australian adventurer.  A transplanted Yank [Washington, DC to Sydney], urban [New York City to, again, Sydney] and Jewish [rather anomalous in the Outback].  These conditions might fatally impair the less adventurous, but Horwitz can \\"boldly go\\" [as he did in a later book] and so he does.  With singular dedication, he even starts his trek heading West from Sydney past Dubbo to the Alice.

She is not, however, merely a nullifier of perceived wisdom.  Her aim is to encourage fuller knowledge of where humans are placed in the realm of the animal kingdom.  Motherhood, the essential point of how evolution works, is examined here as fully as current research can achieve.  Hrdy shows how the role of &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; have been inextricably linked through much of Western history.  Unlike other animals, humans can set ideals for behaviour, ordaining how mothers &quot;ought to behave.&quot;  Deviance from these perceived &quot;norms&quot; has led to various social disruptions, including the famous witchcraft scares.  Ignorance of the evolutionary roots of motherhood have led to a mind-set Hrdy sets out to dispel in this excellent work.  She addresses motherhood with a mind almost unfettered by myths.  Almost, because she is quite candid about her own feelings and experiences.  Not all her emotions were faced with total detachment.<br />Motherhood, she declares, is anything but the simple mythology of unrestrained devotion.  Across all Nature, mothers and their offspring wage ongoing competition.  The issue is  resources.  Infants, all infants, demand as much as a mother can give, and more.  Mothers have to support their infants, but inevitably are occupied with other responsibilities, not the least of which may be the infant's siblings. There are others beyond the mother-infant tie to which she must respond.  If her species is male-dominated, she may face his abuse.  Worse, she may be confronted by invasion by an outside male.  In some species, that spells the doom of her infant.  Hrdy has studied this and related aspects of motherhood among many species, and expresses her own shock at the discovery of primate infanticide.<br />Mothers must maintain many elements in balance, with but a gentle pressure on the scale resulting in disaster.  Family size, role in the family and in the group, location, changing conditions, all contribute to the complexity surrounding a mother's relationship with her offspring.  In humans, this complicated arrangement carries the added burden of a wholly dependent child.  Even monkey young can cling to a foraging mother.  Human babies must be carried.  In our evolutionary past, this condition made the pair vulnerable to predators.  Hrdy coins the phrase &quot;alloparent&quot; applied to another option - allocating care of the baby to someone else.  In the modern world, of course, we call it &quot;day care.&quot;  Allomothers exist in many primate species, however.  &quot;Care-giving&quot; isn't just an urban condition.<br />&quot;Allomothering&quot; historically has led to some disreputable practices, from child slavery to outright abandonment.  Hrdy cites horrifying statistics for infants abandoned at foundling homes.  Still, we have no reason to doubt her numbers.  Orphans, like other prisoners, are a forgotten element in civilized society.  There's another side to allomothering among humans.  What to do with women who are no longer able to bear children - the uniquely human phenomenon known as &quot;menopause&quot;?  Hrdy's response typically focuses on evolutionary roots.  Women no longer hindered by their own offspring are ideal care-givers.  With their experience and wisdom, they readily handle child care and other activities.  The &quot;granny&quot; evolved in humans in large part due to infant dependence, Hrdy stresses.  It was a significant step in forming the human community.<br />Hrdy's free-flowing style and ready wit make this important book highly readable and informative.  She's done, or drawn on, a wealth of research to produce it, presenting riches of information without resorting to pedantry.

Dugard stresses the travails of a man of humble beginnings who, through force of his own will and some fortuitous connections garnered command of the first solo expedition into the South Pacific.  He describes Cook's early voyages on colliers, moving on to his decade-long exploration of the Newfoundland coasts.  Lured away by the glories of the Royal Navy, Cook entered that force as a lowly seaman but rose rapidly to junior officer due to his cartography skills and forceful sense of drive.<br />Dugard dubs Cook &quot;the original adventurer.&quot;  Other expeditions had concentrated on map-ping coastlines along regularly used routes or finding harbours to serve as sanctuaries or supply bases.  Cook's voyage in the Endeavour was the first journey dedicated to scientific studies.  Cook's mandate was to convey a team of scientists to Tahiti.  There they would study the rare phenomenon of Venus' transit across the face of the sun, adding to the navigator's store of tools.  From that mid-Pacific isle, however, Cook was free to seek the legendary Southern Continent, particularly Antarctica.  Given a mandate to wander the Pacific, Cook found yet another landmass, the island continent of Australia.<br />Dugard portrays Cook as impelled by several ambitions.  To become the premier explorer of the Pacific, to bask in the adoration of its peoples, and show Britain's class-bound society that the son of a farm labourer was the equal of any aristocrat.  He achieved all these aims, but at the usual cost to a man overcome by hubris.  He went too far, barely staving off mutiny by a crew that adored him.  In the end, of course, an act of arrogance cost him his life in Hawaii.  Through all this tale of a man burdened by ambition, Dugard offers us glimpses of Elizabeth Cook who remained in England almost mindlessly cheering on her husband's goals.  While Cook sailed as far as from the Earth to the Moon, Elizabeth bore and buried a succession of children.  When the reader feels the urge to learn of her outlook in more detail, Dugard reminds us of her burning the Cook correspondence, eliminating any record of her thoughts.  Unrestrained by evidence, Dugard blithely presents her viewpoint, derived from assumptions.<br />Given the wealth of books available on Cook and his voyages, this one stands well down on the list of &quot;must read&quot; titles.  Only someone with a superficial interest in the explorer and his journeys would find this useful.  A good introductory overview, its lack of bibliography or even an index renders this title merely a journalist's superficial exercise.  There are simply too many scholarly books on Cook, some well written, to warrant spending much time with this one.  Save it for the beach or cottage.d as far as from the Earth to the Moon, Elizabeth bore and buried a succession of children.

History has yet to produce a full account of the British Empire.  One of the reasons for this shortfall is the lack of voices of the invaded.  Nowhere in the former British Empire is the silence more deafening than Australia.  Touched by Europeans for over a century before the Port Jackson convict settlement was founded, Australia was the most enigmatic outpost of Empire.  Although the first Governor was enjoined to deal with the scattered Aborigines fairly, it wasn't long before the true Australians were driven from their lands, murdered or made into domestic servants.  Henry Reynolds, noted historian of the Australian scene, richly  chronicles the attempts by white humanitarians to give these displaced people some level of resistant voice.<br />Reynolds chooses one issue, occupation of the land, as his major theme.  There are, he admits, many other issues that might have been considered, but the land question remained fundamental to European-Aborigine relations.  Australia was the sole colony of the Empire declared \\"terra nullius\\" - unoccupied by human beings, therefore open to unrestricted invasion.  The island continent and all its resources were at the disposal of the Crown.<br />Australia, of course, had occupants when the First Fleet sailed into Botany Bay, and it wasn't long before they began resisting invasion.  Reynolds shows that the Aborigines had allies among the white invaders, people who urged at the very least, that the \\"natives\\" be offered remuneration or protected reserves on which to live.  He reviews the careers of these humanitarians with sympathy and applause, but recognizes the futility of their efforts.  Not a few failed simply because their personalities were unsuited to the task of inhibiting the rape of the continent.<br />Resistance to white oppression of the Aborigines began as early as the first penal settlement.  William Dawes objected to the first of a multitude of punitive expeditions launched to revenge the spearing of a servant.  Reynolds notes these \\"expeditions,\\" which continued into the 20th Century, followed a consistent pattern - unselective killing in revenge for Aborigine defense of their homeland.  From Dawes, Reynolds traces the course of objections to wanton slaughter of Aborigines through the notable figures trying to stem the flood of settlement and its attendant conflict.  He cites George Augustus Robinson's work to isolate Aborigines in Victoria and Tasmania from white settlement - a career which ended disastrously.  Reformers in Western Australia were driven into exile by irate settlers, and Queensland earned its unsavoury reputation with the creation of the Native Police, an unrestrained paramilitary force.  Reynolds intersperses his own text with supportive sources of personal journals, letters, government documents and newspaper articles.  The result is a descriptive potpourri of opinions, accounts, policy making and, most important, a struggle for justice.Reynolds notes these \\"expeditions,\\" which continued into the 20th Century, followed a consistent pattern - unselective killing in revenge for Aborigine defense of their homeland.

The subtitle is pure Dennettian whimsy - \\"designing minds\\" - how many ways can you interpret that phrase.  The minds within this collection are ours, those of machines, and of other animals.  What part has evolution played in our mental elaboration?  Is the mind a form of organic machine?  This question has plagued philosophers for generations, but more intensely since the development of the computer.  Much of the first section is devoted to clarifying the famous Turing Test - can a machine convince humans that it's \\"conscious\\"?  Dennett's conclusion at this point is that it's possible but not likely practical.  In essence, he doesn't care - it's simply not worth the effort.<br />An essay co-authored with Nicholas Humphrey is of wider practicality and social importance.  Is the syndrome known as Multiple Personality Disorder [MPD] a valid psychological disorder?  Dennett and Humphrey probed deeply into this issue, sharply aware of the medical and legal implications.  The authors' resolution of the question is unique, but will not be surprising to those familiar with the Multiple Drafts Model of consciousness spelled out in Dennett's \\"Consciousness Explained.\\"<br />Critics of \\"Consciousness Explained\\" are dealt with in a trio of essays.  Dennett stresses that consciousness is an on-going phenomenon, not built up from a series of discrete events, as posed by some commentators.  He repeats his objections to a \\"central processing location\\" in the mind, his appellation \\"Cartesian Theatre\\" restated anew.<br />Artificial Intelligence is a major interest of Dennett's and he devotes a significant portion of the book to the subject.  He sees much of the work in AI as providing essential contributions to the understanding of consciousness.  After dealing with the imponderables of the \\"frame problem\\" in AI, he seemingly enters a wholly novel area.  He poses a fresh approach to thinking about Artificial Life through a geographic metaphor.  It is one of his more thought provoking \\"intuition pumps.\\"<br />In a new departure, Dennett also offers some autobiographical items for our consideration.  His highly personalized account of witnessing the experiments with vervet monkeys in Kenya is an exemplary account of animal cognition.  One of Dennett's strengths is his ability to deal with philosophical questions in an evolutionary framework.<br />It is always difficult to fix a \\"starting point\\" for those unfamiliar with Dennett's work.  The best introduction to his use of evidence and logical thinking, not to mention the power of his prose, remains Darwin's Dangerous Idea.  Some of his ideas on cognition and ethics appear there, but it doesn't cover his innovative ideas on cognition, which remains the foundation of his work.  Consciousness Explained or The Intentional Stance are the better overtures in that field.  This collection may not fit the bill, except that his incisive thinking presented here may lead to other, more definitive essays on his ideas.  Still, the stature of Dennett's place in consciousness studies and philosophy are vividly displayed in this collection.  If it's your first Dennett, you've chosen wisely.

And flies.  It takes some courage to face these conditions alone, even in modern times.  Tony Horwitz faced them alone and on foot - some of the time.

A transplanted Yank [Washington, DC to Sydney], urban [New York City to, again, Sydney] and Jewish [novel in the Outback].

His cause is known as \\"group selection.\\"  It's a concept of evolution that he admits is \\"out of vogue\\" today.  Group selection has been displaced by variants of \\"the selfish gene\\" - genes driving individual organisms in competition for resources.  Most of the advocates of evolution by organisms are still with us, and Wilson lines them for review like a stern general inspecting troops.  He passes along these ranks with a moue of severe displeasure.  But in a book promoting religion as the finest expression of group selection, Wilson must keep rein on his passions. He treats these miscreants as simply misguided - more disappointed than angry.  He offers conciliation with his opponents by garbing \\"group selection\\" in a new cloak he calls \\"multi-level\\" selection.  He sees this idea as a compromise.  In reality, it's a pious fraud.<br /><br />If it wasn't clear that this book is intended as serious science, it might be considered a hoax.  Wilson attempts to reconcile evolutionary biology with the social sciences to build a case for religion's evolutionary roots.  This has been attempted before, of course, but Wilson provides some new twists.  He rejects Susan Blackmore's idea that religion is a meme, even refusing to use the term.  He likes religion, and tries to give it a Darwinian foundation.  To do so, Wilson reverts to the outdated thesis of \\"society as an organism.\\"  He provides false portrayals of social roles among animals [birds, mostly] he then attempts to project some aspects of social animals onto humans.  Assessing \\"primitive\\" societies in relation to the modern life, he attempts to build a case for the evolutionary roots of religion.  His thesis, however, is built on a porous foundation.<br /><br />As a professional biologist, Wilson makes some perplexing assertions.  Citing bird groups with \\"callers\\" and \\"foragers\\" he presents these as fixed roles.  In fact, the callers must forage, while foragers must stand watch through a rota.  Otherwise the group will not survive.  In religion, \\"callers\\" [priests] remain fixed in their part supported by the remainder of the group. For group selection to work in evolution, the groups require reproductive isolation. Religions, for all their rigidity at times, can represent a wide, diverse population.  In the evolutionary process, this is too wide and mobile a target.  Wilson contends instead that religions \\"evolve\\" through competition with each other.  This idea wholly ignores the multitude of non-deistic or animist adherents in \\"non-Western\\" societies around the world.  As the book progresses, \\"religion\\" in the general sense tends to be displaced by \\"Christianity.\\"  Christianity, maladaptive though it is at times, Wilson credits with attracting adherents as no other religions do.  Evangelism, then, becomes the tactic used to enlarge and enhance the group.  Inevitably, one surmises, one species is to be identified with one religion.<br /><br />Wilson's evenhanded tone is the redeeming feature of this book.  In some cases, he even apologises to other authors if he's misinterpreted them.  His scholarship is wide, reflecting the scope of his interest.  He presents various positions, including his own with clarity and precision.  However, his argument is too tenuous.  Group selection wasn't rejected by science because it was a fad, genetics demonstrated its invalidity.  Wilson may wish to resurrect it, but he hasn't accomplished that miracle here.  His Christian stance allows him to treat his opponents gently, but he doesn't refute their assertion that group selection is biologically groundless.  Even less does the history of religion support it.  Wilson is careful to note \\"religion\\" goes well beyond the role of \\"gods,\\" acting as a social construct.  With this, he takes us from biology to morality.  It's compelling reading, but  He's deft with words, slipping the old \\"genetic determinism\\" charge against those not guilty of it.  He struggles to downplay genetic input as the primary cause of evolutionary change, but fails to provide a structure to replace it.  It was all spelled out by natural selection's original architect.  Darwin's cathedral was built brick by brick - it isn't a modular construction.

Dan Sickles rose from Tammany Hall politics in New York through a London posting to Congress.  While a representative his lovely, but often abandoned, wife Teresa became involved with the widower son of the composer of the Star Spangled Banner, America's national anthem.  Ignoring this heritage, Sickles slew Barton Keys on a Washington Sunday in view of several witnesses.  After a bizarre trial, in which the then novel plea of \\"temporary insanity\\" was invoked, Sickles left the courtroom free of guilt. Almost fortuitously, the onset of the War Between the States allowed Sickles to redeem whatever reputation he lost.  As one of the Union's \\"political generals\\" Sickles proved to be a popular and capable leader.  Gettysburg, that icon of American military history, proved his salvation or disgrace according to which account you follow.  Did he risk another Union defeat by ignoring his superior's orders?<br />Keneally uses Teresa's lonely existence as the focal point of this biography.  Although Sickles was hardly a paragon of virtue, Keneally is perplexed at his long-standing avoidance of Teresa.  He muses over why Sickles kept separate habitation after the killing when Teresa clearly would have welcomed his return.  Later, he mourns the lack of her presence at Sickles' various Army encampments when other generals had their wives visit, if for no other reason than troop morale.  Meagher, a favourite of Keneally's, is held up in contrast.  This Irish ex-convict's wife \\"Libby\\" graced the camp frequently.  Libby, however, hadn't taken any lovers to arouse her husband's ire.  Even after a thorough analysis of the mores of the times, Keneally can't forgive Dan Sickles failure to forgive.<br />This book is strangely structured.  Keneally provides a long build-up to the murder, then dwells over the details of the trial.  No particular is overlooked, from the courtroom temperature to the malodorous spectators.  Forced to limit his description of one lawyer's two day long presentation to eight pages, Keneally manages to convey the role of oratory in the United States at mid-19th Century.  Sickles' role as a general is well-presented, but is over-focussed.  Sickles' ability to deal with Mary Lincoln is given more space than military engagements or the war environment.  As a biography, there is some rationale for this, but the reader best consult some other works for a fuller picture.  The post-war years, with Sickles postings to the Reconstruction South and his escapades in Europe slide past rapidly.  His bizarre second marriage and later life could use some analysis, no matter how far-fetched, but Keneally simply rambles through the known information and leaves the reader to work out the motivations.  At the end, he frankly states the book was written in honour of Teresa's memory.  An unusual approach, but one likely to find favour with today's audience.from the courtroom temperature to the malodorous spectators.

While some authors achieve a peak and slide away, even if only temporarily, Pratchett climbs upward, one step [book] at a time, reaching new crests.  This work is indisputably his finest endeavor.  Unlike other &quot;fantasy&quot; [ugh!] writers, he is able to draw on scientific sources to support his stories.  In this instance it's quantum physics, time travel and probability.  Oh, yes, and people.  Plot and environment are set gently aside in Pratchett's quest to portray folks.  Real people in real circumstances.  Or at least as real as living in Ankh-Morpork, the Discworld's major city, will allow.  We are once again confronted with the puzzle of how much is Sam Vimes Pratchett's idol and how much is Pratchett himself?<br />All Terry Pratchett's characters are fascinating in their own way.  Rincewind, a spectacular coward, expresses a survivor's continuing agonies of fear and distrust.  Esme Weatherwax dons a cape of firm self-assurance you could roof a shed with - until she's alone and surveying her frailties.  In Sam Vimes, however, Pratchett produced someone special.  In his own view Sam sometimes strides on feet of clay.  Plagued by self-doubts, worrying about problems often not his, beset by hordes of enemies and unpredictable circumstances, Vimes manages to trot up to the finish line soiled but sturdy.  We live in an era when &quot;character&quot; is a disreputable phrase.  Still, Sam Vimes arrives at each finale by employing resolute self discipline, applying it to himself or imparting it to others.  In this book, that example becomes bifurcated by Sam's knowledge that he's coaching his younger self.  Maintaining his own standards while imparting them to young Lance-Constable Vimes is a challenging situation.  He was pursuing a killer in his own time - he continues the pursuit in the past.  He's also, once again, caught up in Ankh-Morpork politics.<br />Transported back in time, Vimes remains burdened with memories.  Sybil, his wife, is about to produce their first born [promised in Fifth Elephant].  A Watch mainstay, Fred Colon, is an established Corporal, while Nobby Nobbs, a social stain, is a street urchin seeking the main chance.  Sam encounters old friends and makes new ones.  Some don't survive.  Pratchett's ability to give life to each of his characters brings a sense of grief at their loss other authors fail to achieve.  You cannot prevent a pause in your reading when you learn of their deaths. There is one  character you're eager to see &quot;pass on,&quot; but Pratchett denies you that comfort.  Fantasy or no, reality is firmly established here.  As always with Pratchett, the characters are your neighbours and family.  You know them intimately, never mind their distance in time and place.  You rejoice in their successes and mourn their losses.  It's all part of Pratchett's ability to capture the reader - new or long- standing.<br />Back in an earlier Ankh-Morpork, Vimes assumes the identity of John Keel.  In this role, he establishes new standards in the Watch - dress, behaviour, skills, attitudes.  Those who can't conform are eased [at least] out.  Inevitably, the role of the Watch in relation to the military arises.  Pratchett has addressed this issue before, of course, and it remains unresolved.  Especially in times of civil unrest and resentment over government and taxes.  The old labour movement refrain &quot;Which Side Are You On&quot; might have replaced the tune running through this book.<br />Clearly, Pratchett is far more interested in helping his readers confront the world than in carving himself a comfortable niche among escapist fantasy writers.  Those who bemoan the loss of &quot;humour&quot; in his recent works [although the asides in this book are among his best], are ignoring the message.  He's a serious thinker imparting his ideas using the methods at his command.  To pigeonhole him is to ignore his message or reject it.  He deserves better.  The next &quot;critic&quot; who labels Pratchett as a &quot;humorous fantacist&quot; can meet me in Sator Square.  Bring your own weapons, but be advised my chosen second is the Commander of the Ankh-Morpork Watch . . .The next &quot;critic&quot; who labels Pratchett as a &quot;humorous fantacist&quot; can meet me in Sator Square.

All the stars in Amazon's firmament aren't sufficient reward for this masterpiece.  Flanagan uses nested metaphors like the famous Russian dolls, each exposing a new level of the same theme.  Here the theme is the perception of the written word.  Which of the stories told here is the valid one?  Are all of them real, or all false?  Lest this sound confusing, reader, take heart.  Flanagan is a master storyteller and all he asks of you is a bit of patience while he unravels the life of a man beset by forces of breathtaking scope.  After all, he is presenting you with the world of the British Empire.<br />Will a valid history of that Empire ever be written?  Flanagan makes no such claim.  He views its immensity from a tiny salient through the eyes of one its outcasts.  William Buelow Gould is a man whose perception becomes increasingly distorted in a place that could break the strongest mind.  Macquarie Harbour was a dumping ground for \\"hard case\\" convicts.  Here, a thirty-two year old appears decrepit.  Here, all were \\"cobbers and dobbers\\" - men were mates ranged against prison authority but turning traitor against each other [\\"dobbing in\\"] when survival was the issue.  Gould, an artist-forger, seems spared the worst effects of The System when he's posted to the colony's surgeon to produce watercolours of the local marine life.  In this role, Flanagan takes us on a tour of \\"scientifick\\" thought of the time and its impact on people on the far reaches of the Empire - which spans the planet.  Phrenology, evolution, religion of the time come to light from his skilled prose.<br />Gould, ever a pawn on The System's board, is taken from the surgeon to embark on a fresh enterprise.  The prison Commandant has a commission for him.  Gould's new project reflects the Commandant's ambitions for the colony, but we witness a new attitude in Gould as the story develops.  What truly happened in this place bracketed by screaming winds and a mountain wilderness that inhibited dreams of escape?  Flanagan makes Gould the only valid witness to events - at least the only one leaving a record.  Can we, however, trust the words of someone recording so many irrational acts?  Gould assures us: \\"if you can't trust a liar & a forger, a whore & an informer, a convicted murderer & a thief, you'll never understand this country.\\"  To Flanagan, that statement sums up the dilemma of Australia.  Whose account of history are we to believe?<br />Gould is ultimately convicted of a bizarre murder and placed in a cell inundated by each day's tide.  Using his marine paintings he begins the chronicle of his life in the colony.  His Book of Fish, however, ranges far beyond simply a journal of events illustrated with symbolic watercolours.  Flanagan assaults all written accounts as deceptive, even questioning the validity of the most mundane of books - a prison registry.  The registry becomes a pivot around which Flanagan twists a skein of questions of human values.  More than simply historical \\"truth\\" is under scrutiny here.  What price are we prepared to pay in resolving \\"scientifick\\" issues?  How can we categorize our fellow humans when we know, as Aborigine Twopenny Sal tells Gould, \\"Long time before, you were us.\\"  Human ancestry lies in Africa, not London, Sydney or even Ottawa.  The questions haunt Gould throughout the book, and Flanagan wants them to haunt you a bit, as well.  Read him and ponder them.escape?

Berton sees Arctic exploration following two paths.  First, the quest for a clear water route across North America - the famous Northwest Passage.  The Passage quest was sought as a means of avoiding the rigours of Cape Horn or the competition on the Indian Ocean.  The second quest was to fulfill the romance to stand at the North Pole.  According to Berton, neither of these aims was achieved, despite claims to the contrary.<br />For most of the 19th Century, Arctic explorations were dominated by the British.  Royal Navy ships, fully manned but inadequately provisioned, skirted or bludgeoned the ice in search of open water.  As in North America and Australia, the British assumed an &quot;inner sea&quot; that might link the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  Berton scorns John Barrow's adherence to the  &quot;Open Polar Sea&quot; idea, but it dictated the plans of many British explorers.  As Berton shows, the erratic nature of Arctic ice packs lent credence to the concept.  Some years vast expanses of open water would appear, only to be sealed off the following year.  These varying conditions plagued Passage and Pole pursuers alike.<br />Berton skims over the 1818 Ross expedition opening the RN's Passage quest to introduce us to William E. Parry.  Parry [for whom Ontario tourist centre Parry Sound is named], made three attempts to find the open water leading to the Pacific.  Although his efforts reflect a courageous and dedicated officer, the real impact of Parry's voyages resulted from the loss of one of his ships.  Ice pressure forced the Fury onto a beach where her stores couldn't be transferred to the other ship.  In this location, well known to the Royal Navy, the Fury became a lodestone for lost adventurers seeking supplies.<br />The ineptness of Royal Navy planners permeates Berton's account.  For successive decades the RN continued to send men North to live on salted meat, making them lug huge sleds across the ice, ignoring the recommendations to use dog teams and provide hunters for fresh meat.  This stubborn policy condemned countless sailors to miserable deaths in extreme conditions.  Men died not from the freezing temperatures, but from the debilitating effects of scurvy.  Lemon juice [not the &quot;limey&quot; elixir that led to the appellation applied to British sailors] was an inadequate antiscorbutic - it would freeze on the open sleds and wasn't as effective as fresh meat.  Still, the RN persisted in using it.<br />The key to many Arctic explorations was the inexplicable loss of 129 men and the two ships of the 1845 John Franklin expedition.  Franklin's career was beset by ineptness, having been cashiered as Governor of Van Dieman's Land and nearly died during an earlier land expedition.  These transgressions were forgiven by the British public and ignored by the Admiralty planners, who were goaded on by Franklin's wife, Jane, for decades.  Expeditions by land and sea were mounted, some privately financed by Lady Jane.  The explorers learned much about the Arctic, but little truly determined what prompted Franklin's crew to flee the ships.<br />Berton calls the successive ventures the &quot;Arctic virus,&quot; asserting that it most recognized the Northwest Passage as a chimera.  That claim is unlikely, since the quest continued into the 20th Century with the Norwegian Raoul Amundsen's successful venture.  However impractical the route, due to the vagaries of the ice pack, it remained an aim.  Berton moves from the Passage to the more romantic objective of planting a flag at the Pole.  The early attempts, including the ill-fated balloon Eagle's venture are vividly described.  As every schoolchild &quot;knows&quot; the storm of contention came to centre on two men.  Robert Edward Peary and Dr. Frederick Cook were thrown together in a concurrent race to achieve the goal.Berton's analysis of both expeditions makes a worthy finale to this book.  Although today, Peary is generally accepted as the man who &quot;stood on the roof of the world,&quot; Berton weighs the evidence and finds the award wanting.  Americans who haven't read Dennis Rawlins assessment of Peary's account will no doubt be shocked to learn Peary had to have faked his daily travel rates.  At best, he stopped 150 kilometres from the goal.<br />Berton's book is invigorating reading.  His highly detailed account is drawn from numerous original journals and later histories.  The combination gives him a solid foundation for his narrative, brought to life by his animated prose.  The accompanying maps and illustrations enhance each story as it unfolds under his deft touch.  A thorough reading list for each chapter provides the bibliography, and the indexing is thorough.  Given the expenditure of life, funds and material squandered on these ventures, Berton's effort to portray the complete picture deserves attention and respect.  With heroism, persistence, romance all pigments in Berton's portrayal, this book can appeal to nearly everyone.oal.  Berton's analysis of both expeditions makes a worthy finale to this book.

Descola readily admits how poorly prepared he was for the study of the Achuar.  Yet he was quickly disabused of any idea that this group of the \\"Jivaro\\" constituted a \\"simple native\\" community.  His account shows the complexity of life they endure.  Family relationships entwine political situations and Achuar society is sustained by a fine balance among many forces.  Not the least of these are the roles played by every plant and animal in the surrounding forest.  Each Achuar individual carries immense knowledge of his or her surroundings and performs daily activities within carefully prescribed limits.  Living in an Ecuadorian forest is no more complex than dwelling in a \\"civilized\\" city in Descola's view.  It's simply a matter of learning how.<br />Descola quickly settled in as guest of a family - unravelling the roots of interaction among its members took longer.  Men's and women's lives follow preset roles, however the balance of power between genders, he shows us, must be constantly adjusted to changing circumstances.  Marriages and separations are frequent, sometimes leading to long-standing vendettas, complicated by the relationships of the participants which are as twisted as the forest vines.  Vendetta, it seems, is far more consequential in the lives of the Achuar than long-term traditions.  The stereotypical \\"tradition bound\\" native is nonexistent here.  Family and personal relationships also preclude the development of our familiar hierarchical society.  No community leaders rise to particular prominence since family status has priority.  These conditions, Descola points out, obviate the existence of political hierarchies, so dear to Western society.<br />Life among the Achuar is filled with rituals, from the morning cup of \\"wayus\\" through various rites of passage to, possibly, the achievement of \\"juunt,\\" or \\"Great Man\\" status.  Anthropology is rife with tales of powerful shamans who guide the behaviour of awed villagers.  Descolas sweeps away this image, noting that shamans among the Achuar may be exiled or deposed, perhaps even killed if their powers prove futile, misleading or faulty.  To be effective, the juunt must prove his abilities as a healer - a sorcerer will be rejected.  Although the position of juunt takes years of effort to achieve, the role may be lost overnight.  On the other hand, they are resourceful and caring - they make house calls.  Sometimes at great distance, leading them to temporarily profess conversion to Christianity long enough to hitch a ride on the missionary's aircraft to the patient.<br />Descola's narrative is nearly a daily journal of his own learning and efforts.  Although his wife Anne Christine accompanied him, she flits but wraith-like through these pages, nearly obscured by Descola's own revelations.  Yet it's clear she provided information on the women's lives that might have endangered Descola had he attempted to garner it.  Given the intricate structure of Achuar life, Descola may be forgiven this omission of detail.<br />Janet Lloyd's translation isn't lively, but the events and ideas Descola relates keep the reader's interest throughout the book.  He manages to both dismiss faulty myths about South American peoples and impart a wealth of new information.  Dreams, for example, considered random in the West, may actually be \\"created\\" among the Achuar depending on circumstances and needs.  Dreams drive behaviour and vice versa.  Descola sees Achuar dreaming as an extension of conscious thought - an assertion deserving intense study.  This is but one example of what keeps this book interesting and valuable.Man\\" status.

Careers blighted, marriages sundered, and hopes dashed by policies derived from artificial foundations [see Helen Garner's The First Stone for excellent case study of GP tactics and their impact]. All the individual destruction pales in light of what has been happening to a generation of schoolchildren - the most vulnerable element in any society. Sommers provides the first clear indication of what is happening to male schoolchildren, and what might be done to reverse the plunging achievement levels among American boys. As a result of Sommers' work, studies in Canada reflect a similar condition among boys. Why are boys falling behind?<br />Sommers' thesis is that the past generation of feminist propaganda bemoans \\"low self-esteem\\" among adolescent girls. This assertion is based on false information, with Sommers focussing on Carol Gilligan's work as the primary culprit. Gilligan kept her data secret and her assertions weren't substantiated by later research, according to Sommers. However spurious the evidence, a fusillade of allegations has led to numerous government shifts in education policy to benefit girls. The result hasn't benefitted girls as much as humiliated boys. The basis of the policy, in the words of Gloria Steinem, is that \\"we need to raise boys like we raise girls.\\" This attitude, Sommers contends, is designed to treat boys as something to be \\"cured.\\" Sommers would rather support them as boys, establishing equity based on valid assessments of their needs as well as that of girls. To her credit, the book offers numerous suggestions for restoring the achievement levels boys have lost.<br />Sommers' assault on \\"progressive\\" education will jar some readers. A return to 18th Century school conditions is fraught with difficulties - not least of which is teacher allocation. She stresses that strrengthening education in responsibility and civility will necessarily focus on boys, with males likely carrying much of that teaching load. The primary purpose of this book is to alert parents to what is happening in their schools and what the impact will be to reverse the process. Sommers' focus on the classroom skirts the home environment in her assessment. The Colombine High School massacre, an event she revisits frequently, might have been avoided by better weapons control.<br />Sommers is to be congratulated for eschewing assessments of boys' attitudes about their repression. She doesn't impart resentful views to them, latent hostility to the girls who have been elevated over them, or other intangibles. She sticks to the numbers and the cases that typify what is happening to boys and who has instigated their degradation. She accepts the recent findings of evolutionary psychologists who have provided improved insights into natural male/female roles. It's a pity she doesn't offer a reading list on this topic, but it's a rapidly expanding field. Steven Pinker's The Blank Slate, recently published, also targets Gilligan's contentions about \\"low self-esteem\\" among girls.<br />This book is long overdue and has arrived in time to prevent the loss of another generation of boys. Prevention, however, means a wide readership and prompt action on the part of concerned parents. It's certainly a \\"must read\\" book for those with children in public schools.

Cultural mores have been challenged, essential ideas decried as \\"social artefacts\\" and the reputations of heroic idols, nearly universally male, demolished as shams.  It's become a novelty to encounter the celebratory resurrection of a forgotten icon.  McGoogan relates the life and accomplishments of Scotsman John Rae, who joined a Hudson's Bay Company ship as surgeon, travelled to Canada in 1833 and remained for twelve years - on the first stay.  McGoogan has surveyed many of the resources dealing with Arctic exploration, but Rae's own accounts provide the essential framework for this compelling narrative.  The book is nearly two stories in one: Rae's ranging explorations along the Canadian Arctic coast, and the mysterious disappearance of the John Franklin expedition.  McGoogan keeps this paired account nicely balanced until they merge to determine Rae's future reputation.<br />John Rae was a departure from the usual explorer of the Victorian age.  Instead of heading complex expeditions, he travelled with a small support group.  Instead of ships or extensive caravans, he travelled by canoe or small boat, on land using snowshoes.  He was extraordinarily hardy, traversing extensive distances, often alone.  He adapted many features of Aboriginal life in his travels when \\"going native\\" was disdained by most.  He kept his associates fed when other British explorers were starving on government rations.  He found the route of the elusive Northwest passage and determined the fate of the lost Franklin expedition seeking that route.  Later, he turned from Arctic adventures to the survey of a telegraph line site across the Rocky Mountains.  Why have we heard so little of him?<br />According to McGoogan, one individual maintained a steady campaign to reduce Rae's reputation.  Jane Franklin, Sir John's quasi-widow [she refused to admit her husband's death for years], irked by the possibility her husband had turned to cannibalism in extremity, actively challenged many of Rae's accomplishments.  She fostered Leopold McClintock as the verifier of Sir John's finding of the Northwest Passage.  In her zeal, she even managed to secure the aid of no less a figure than Charles Dickens to her cause.  McGoogan contends Dickens' virulent racism aided this assault when the novelist asserted the Inuit were consummate liars and the true cannibals.  In the event, John Rae stands out as the only explorer of note that failed to achieve knighthood for his achievements.<br />McGoogan has produced a noteworthy study, done with lively wit and solid research.  This book restores John Rae's position as the true finder of the Northwest Passage and as man with few peers.  This book can be read by anyone seeking knowledge of the North or as a model of perseverance and sacrifice.

Grudgingly, the family sent him to university.  Even so, a professional career in law should have returned Don to Ankara.  Instead, he has fled to an alien world - the mountains of Colombia.  As through all his life, Keith doggedly follows Don again, struggling to comprehend his brother's motivation.  Henighan imparts Keith Merrick's worlds with striking insight in a onvincing narrative.<br />Using his rural Ottawa Valley upbringing and Latin American travels, Henighan employs Keith as a vehicle for depicting how inadequately people in the Western Hemisphere understand their neighbours.  To Canadian farmers, Colombia might be on Mars - in Bogota all gringos are &quot;norteamericanos&quot; - tourists from the u.s.a.  Canada, likewise, might as well be on Mars.  This is the basis of Henighan's story - &quot;America&quot; is not only the land between the 49th parallel and the Rio Grande River.  There are, indeed, &quot;Other Americas&quot; and Henighan is anxious for us to glimpse them, however vaguely.<br />Henighan sends Keith through the streets of Bogota and into the countryside.  He's robbed, struggles to sustain his finances, stumbles into bizarre acquaintances, all the while beset by the novelty of his environment.  Throughout the story, Henighan takes Keith into his early life in the Ottawa Valley, interspersing his Colombian quest with episodes of his roots.  In some hands, this technique is clumsy, interrupting the narrative flow.  Henighan performs it with finesse, providing the framework on which Keith must deal with his alien world.  At the end, Keith must accept or deny the path Don has laid down for him to follow.  It's a test of strength and character.  Even if few of us are compelled to meet such a challenge, we all must be aware of its existence.  These are, indeed, our neighbours and we, like Keith, must get to know them.  Henighan ably presents his vivid message, and it is one which we must all heed.aware of its existence.  These are, indeed, our neighbours and we, like Keith, must get to know them.

Munro-Hay's subtitle: The Unknown Land provides a clue to the problem he faced in summarizing the history and culture of this ancient country.  Known to early Christians as the land of &quot;Prester John,&quot; Ethiopia's nearly landlocked location and rugged terrain has made it a challenge to scholars for millennia.  Munro-Hay makes an earnest effort to enlighten us on many aspects of Ethiopian history and culture.  Rather than provide a surface overview, he divides the country into regions based on ancient kingdoms.  It's an effective means of organizing the complex store of research he's brought to the task.<br />After an opening overview of Ethiopian history, the author provides a survey of the role of the Church in the society.  For Ethiopia, this element cannot be overstated.  Churches and their rituals are a fundamental part of Ethiopia life.  He details the structure of church hierarchy and the roles assigned the various officers.  Rituals and other aspects such as religious art are also described.  Munro-Hay then gives a brief survey of the foreigners who entered the country, evaluating their published accounts.  Foreign impact played a major role in how Ethiopia came to be a modern nation, with Portuguese, Arabs and others providing architectural expertise, trade and political developments.  Some lasting impact of the Italian invasion in this century is added.<br />The theme of this book relates the histories of ten important regions making up historical Ethiopia and into modern times.  While all had their impact, three are of particular import.  Gondar, situated near Lake Tana, was considered to be ruled by descendants of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.  Munro-Hay sees the political patterns set in ancient Gondar to carry through Ethiopia history until modern times.  The heritage was so important that even usurpers found ways of establishing legitimacy by claiming descent from those origins.  Munro-Hay provides diagrams of ancient Gondar and vivid descriptions of what remains from a glorious imperial city.<br />Next in significance is the ancient site of Aksum.  Certainly, as Munro-Hay notes, it's of vital archaeological importance and worth any visitor's time and effort.  Well north of Addis Ababa and on the way to the Red Sea, Aksum nearly disappeared until extensive excavations during the 1970s revealed its importance.  The remnants of the city are dotted with numerous stone stelae, possibly inspired by similar constructions in Egypt, Ethiopia's<br />neighbour.  Munro-Hay conducts us on a tour of these and other historical sites in a compelling chapter.  As a participant in some of the exploratory work, the author is well-suited to describe what has been revealed.  He does so with verve and close detail.<br />In his Forward, Munro-Hay reminds us that at the time of writing, Ethiopia had provided the oldest representative of our ancestry, Don Johanson's &quot;Australopithecus afarensis,&quot; the 3.6 million-year old &quot;Lucy.&quot;  It's somewhat of a surprise that Ethiopia's other prehistory doesn't emerge for another 350 pages.  In Yeha, &quot;the beginnings of Ethiopian civilization are rooted,&quot; including the distinctive script still in use.  Close to the Red Sea, Yeha appears to have adopted Semitic languages and religious artefacts from its Arabic neighbours.  Pre-Christian temples and other buildings may still be seen there.<br />Munro-Hay is an acknowledged leader in the study of Ethiopia.  This book is a monument to his scholarship.  Rich in detail and presenting both ancient and modern aspects of Ethiopian life, it provides excellent resource material for anyone wishing to pursue the topic.  At less than 400 pages, the book is also a worthwhile companion to the traveler.  Clearly written and beautifully organized for both scholar and tourist, this book will remain useful for some time.me.	2002-11-11

Marta begins life in a secluded mountain valley, the sole survivor of four children.  Poverty is a constant companion, and her life is fraught with challenges to survival.  Because her mother, Juana, is black, the villagers suspect her of being a witch.  Marta's own grandmother asserts this daily, leaving Marta with a permanent shadow throughout her life.  Marta takes consolation in the company of her departed siblings, dancing in the graveyard as if in play with other children.  These spirits follow her as she leaves the village with a soldier, accompanying him first to Quito, then to Montreal where they hope to find a new life.<br />The Montreal scene only increases her problems.  Confronted with the complexities of Quebec's bizarre language problems, her husband condemns her to solitude with their daughter.  He thinks her incapable of assuming a role in the city's complex society.  Abandoned by Gonzalo, she is forced to come to grips with it in order to survive.  She learns about buses, shopping in cities, dealing with landlords.  In the midst of her struggles, she meets a Separitiste who brings a new element into her life.  &quot;Enrique&quot; is an enigma that Marta must resolve to achieve peace from the pressures of her early life.  When circumstances overwhelm her, she seeks the spirits of her childhood, but the consolation, when there, rarely proves sufficient.<br />Henighan's extensive experience in Latin America gives him a level of perception shared by few authors.  He clearly understands South American mountain village life and mores. He has taken the unusual tack of following the life of an Ecuadorian woman of &quot;negrito&quot; ancestry.  He accomplishes this transformation with delicate skill and striking confidence.  He imparts Marta's feelings of confusion, fear and ambition flawlessly.  In tune with the distress immigrants to Canada face, we share their sense of alienation, their desire to &quot;belong&quot; even while seeking comfort with their fellow Latins.  &quot;Places&quot; is not a light read, dealing with areas  distinctly alien to most North American readers.  If for no other reason, read Henighan for his ability to impart these other worlds.  His sense of &quot;place&quot; is keen and he leads you along some torturous paths to expose them.  The guidance is sure, however, and you will come away from this book with a sense of fresh awareness of previously hidden worlds.igrants to Canada face, we share their sense of alienation, their desire to &quot;belong&quot; even while seeking comfort with their fellow Latins.  &quot;Places&quot; is not a light read, dealing with areas  distinctly alien to most North American readers.

Wade Davis relates the stories of two Richards, Schultes and Spruce, plus his own in their respective excursions in the upper Amazon.  Schultes, Davis' Harvard mentor, spent many years there seeking medicinal plants and new sources of rubber when access to Asian resins were lost during World War II.  No work of fiction, including Hollywood's almost trifling account in the film Medicine Man, can match the scope of what Schultes accomplished during his extensive travels.  Schultes had the good sense to approach the Native American shamans with respect, dealing with them on their terms and not as a latter-day conquistador.  They responded to his inquiries in kind, leading to countless new medicines for treating our \\"civilized\\" illnesses.  He became a \\"depswa\\" - medicine man - sharing their rituals while gaining knowledge.  Davis is able to use his close relationship with Schultes to provide an engrossing and detailed account of Schultes' career in the bush.<br />The second Richard is Schultes' own model.  Richard Spruce came to the Upper Amazon from mid-Victorian England.  Prompted by an inestimable source, Charles Darwin's account of the Beagle voyage, Spruce entered the Amazon country in 1849.  Few of the celebrated explorers in Africa in the same period can match the perils Spruce faced and dealt with.  As did his follower Schultes, Spruce avoided the overbearing colonialist image - his desires were achieved by finding new medicinal plants.  Spruce dealt with the dispensers of drugs and their tales of visions incurred as an equal.  In their turn they imparted valuable information leading to useful medicines.  Clearly, both Schultes and Spruce operated as Davis stipulates: \\"botanists in the Amazon must come to peace with their own ignorance.\\"  As Schultes, Spruce and Davis himself demonstrate, the peaceful approach brings substantial rewards in information and experience.<br />Davis' own, modern, story enhances that of his mentor Schultes, carrying the research and adventure forward.  Only the ability to travel further and faster than his teacher separates the two.  Davis has a sensitive touch in describing the world of the Upper Amazon, its dense forests and often mysterious people.  His grief at the loss of their culture is manifest, buttressed by a strong historical sense of what they once were.  Certainly this account belies the image of the \\"detached\\" scientist scouring the forest's resources for personal gain.  He is there to learn and to teach us.  He accomplishes both with a fascinating narrative.  This is a book to be treasured and read again.  A single sitting with this book is but an introduction to this disappearing world.

Goodman wrote at the height of protests over civil rights, race and gender equality and war in Viet Nam.  Hitchens assaults various icons of this generation with skillful prose and deep insight.  \\"Unthinking acceptance\\" is his chief target.  He is always worth reading, even if you are in opposition with his conclusions.  This series of \\"letters\\" to young people is Hitchens at his best.  He seeks to respond to the query asking \\"how a radical or 'contrarian' life may be lived.\\"  His persistent theme is to question whatever \\"accepted wisdom\\" is encountered.<br />He opens with some definitions and explanations for his use of the unusual term \\"contrarian.\\"  Earlier terms, such as \\"dissenter,\\" \\"iconoclast\\" and \\"freethinker\\" are generally applied to religious heretics.  \\"Intellectual,\\" coined during the Dreyfus Affair in France, retains a record of scornful judgment and is too limited.  Hitchens prefers \\"contrarian\\" as helping the independent mind keeping focussed on \\"how it thinks\\" instead of \\"what it thinks.\\"  He reminds the young reader that maintaining independent thought is a lonely and essentially thankless task.  In fact, he reminds us that if somebody expresses admiration for your insights, you're probably doing something wrong!<br />In this collection there are no polemics, no identified targets, no vituperation against individuals or institutions.  The theme is encouragement of individual thinking and reflection.  No particular issues are raised and examined.  Instead, patterns of thinking and the actions taken are considered.  The reader is enjoined to reflect on which paths to consider and follow, since Hitchens is sympathetic with those confronted by the multiplicity of issues facing them.  He further stresses that none of the subjects confronting young people today are likely to be resolved in absolute terms.  He is conscious of his own inability to deal in absolutes - 'quietly proud of what little I'd done, as well as ashamed by how little that was.\\"  A realistic statement, it's one adding value to the advice on individuality permeating this book.<br />Reading this collection is, of course, but a starting point.  While he abjures demands for a \\"reading list,\\" the essays are sprinkled with sources for examples of unconstrained thinking.  Beginning with Emile Zola, he encourages readers to investigate George Dangerfield, Rilke, E.P. Thompson and  Joseph Heller.  That's a hefty assignment, but, as Hitchens stresses, achieving justice isn't an easy nor popular path.  Hitchens disavows aspirations of becoming either a \\"leader\\" or a \\"role model\\" for young contrarians.  Even so, his autobiographical comments provide clues to what must be done to fulfill the role.  And every individual, he stresses, has an individual role - not everyone is expected to reach his level nor anyone else's.  The only injunction is to continually self-examine what your beliefs are and how you express them.  Only then can you be certain you qualify as a contrarian in pursuit of justic.<br />The theme of this book was anticipated by F. M.

As with the other mammals, human mating behaviour is a compelling subject of study.  In this comprehensive account, Buss ranges over the many aspects we associate with mating, from conflict through pain to legislation.  Mating practices, whether human or other animal, are the product of evolutionary pressures.  Until we recognize those roots, Buss argues, we will never fully understand many elements affecting our lives.  One of the first elements to consider is that both men and women have short- and long-term mating strategies.  These \\"programs\\" must be taken in account when dealing with relationship issues.<br />Buss is forthright about the study of evolutionary psychology and human social activities.  He asserts that many roles, under attack by some people in our society, are deeply rooted in our background.  We will never legislate them away nor be able to ignore them.  There are inherent differences between the sexes, and these must be recognized for what they are.  Society has attempted to smother some of these differences, and failure to stifle natural urges have likely led to more social suffering than any other single cause.<br />Buss goes further than simply calling for more attention to the basis for our mating behaviour.  He notes some surprising aspects of our relationships.  The \\"henpecked husband\\" is more prevalent than even our comedians would expect.  Males, especially in a long-term relationship Buss argues, will become more submissive than females.  They will change or accept demands more than those just entering a liaison.  This certainly refutes the long-held stereotype of submissive women.  On the assumption readers will seek out his chapter on rape, there are no end of surprises here.  Although few would argue ape is an adapted evolutionary strategy, the demographics of rape do show a relation with normal patterns of male sexual behaviour.<br />This book is the result of a massive amount of research undertaken over many human societies.  Not simply a quick snapshot of a few people from the Western world, the information here has been gleaned over many years and many cultures.  The patterns Buss describes are universals of the human population.  Nor is this simply a dry academic study.  Buss is aware of social issues, personal and gender prejudices and legal considerations.  He is careful to note that evolutionary roots are not \\"genetic determinism\\" and men and women are not \\"doomed\\" to follow particular behaviours.  As he puts it, \\"understanding why sexual<br />strategies have developed and what functions they were designed to serve provides a powerful fulcrum of changing behaviour.\\"  His candid approach, combined with a style designed to impart information without overwhelming his readers, makes this a valuable book.  More teachers, legislators and counselors should read and apply Buss' findings.  His work should eliminate many prejudices if properly applied.br />This book is the result of a massive amount of research undertaken over many human societies.

If this book was a compilation of short fiction, it would deserve the highest marks.  It's creative in style, vividly presented, with inventive characterization.  There are villains galore, tarnished heroes, even a ghost to add a metaphysical aspect.  The language is animated and mesmerizing.  The authors all exhibit a fine sense of invention in dealing with their chosen subjects and the persona involved.  In one sense, this book is a treasure.  It's hard to know where one could find such a collection of provocative and beguiling essays in one binding.<br />Unfortunately, instead of fiction, this series purports to be works of science.  The authors are well-known in the scientific community.  Yet each blithely ignores the actual expressions of those scientific peers they heartily condemn.  They simply categorize without evidence, or twist words to fit some preconceived niche.  They have no qualms about inserting words and meaning into a science that they both fail to comprehend nor have worked in themselves.  The common target of these authors is the new science of evolutionary psychology, a derivative of Edward Wilson's Sociobiology, published a generation ago.  Without reserve nor hesitation, the authors condemn this nascent field as \\"determinist,\\" \\"fatalistic,\\" or \\"simplistic.\\"  In short,<br />just plain wrong.<br />What compels a task force of scientists to attack an emerging science?  Wilson's 1975 call for further research in animal behaviour resulted in a wealth of new information - but much of it on \\"other\\" animals.  The authors here ignore that work entirely.  The basic issue, of course, is how dependent human behaviour is on the evolutionary process.  It's impossible to discern what alternative to evolution there is in determining our roots.  Certainly, none of these essays proposes other mechanisms.  What is terribly awkward about these essays is not simply that they're wrong, but wrong and misleading in so many ways.<br />While all of these essays are built upon contrived issues and arguments, three stand out as particularly noxious examples of politicized science. [We will pass over the departed Gould's final sally attempting to restore his discredited idea of \\"punk eek.\\"]  Hilary Rose attempts to discredit Darwin on the basis of his being a man of his times.  Her essay reminds us that there is a clear distinction between a \\"feminist scientist\\" and a woman researcher such as Helena Cronin.  Steve Rose carries politicization of science to almost desperate extremes in the concluding essay, asserting evolutionary psychology is an \\"ideology\\" [which it most certainly is not].  He, along with the other authors, falls back on the tired and tiresome clich&eacute; of EP research as \\"Just So\\" stories.  Of all the essays in this set, it is Mary Midgley's on memes that evokes the deepest emotions.  Hilarity, compassion, resentment, unease, all arise as a result of reading this wandering, facile attempt disparage something she's unable to understand.  She begins with a wrong definition of the term, then wanders, phantom-like, over the philosophical countryside \\"in her stout British walking shoes\\" to arrive - simply lost in her own rhetoric.  Her presence in this collection is an embarrassment to friend and foe alike.<br />The only value this book has is its demonstration of the mind-set of a few self-deluded and outmoded commentators.  The title itself is a giveaway.  \\"Arguments Against Evolutionary Psychology\\" is no more valid than \\"Arguments Against Cosmology,\\" or \\"Quantum Physics\\" or \\"Paleoanthropology\\" or whatever science is striving for standards in assessing elusive evidence.  The book does not, can not, even answer its own opening question: \\"Why is this book important?\\"  None of these authors work in the field [Midgley, for example is a \\"philosopher\\"], and none deal directly with the research involved.  They are outsiders,<br />sniping away at a science they neither comprehend nor are qualified to critique.  How then, do they expect a reading public to take them seriously?  If you must read this book, do so, but don't encourage such twaddle by spending your money on it.expect a reading public to take them seriously?

Moses Odinga, raised in an animal shelter in central Africa, is bracketed by a loving mother and a freebooting aunt.  Charity and Prudence, divergent personalities, logically follow dissimilar life paths.  Prudence's has led her from Egyptology to Europa the Jovian Satellite.  In her travels, she's stumbled on artifacts indicating, finally, that human beings are not alone in the universe.  The results of that discovery reach beyond nearly anyone's imagination.  While Prudence struggles for recognition, and income, from her discoveries, Moses has been kidnapped, resulting in a life among vicious street children and even more vicious animals.  But Moses has a talent - he can communicate with nearly everything but humans.  This skill is honed as he faces increasingly difficult challenges.  He develops other skills as well - notably very efficient killing ones.  How useful will this secretive street urchin be in preventing a comet from doing to humanity what another did to the dinosaurs?<br />Building on their writings as scientists merged with their collaboration with Terry Pratchett, Stewart and Cohen have produced a gripping story.  Wandering comets and near-Earth asteroids are much in the news these days.  What if there's more involved than \\"simple\\" celestial mechanics?  Applying their respective sciences to the fullest, the authors propose life forms in the Jovian atmosphere and unimaginable forces applied to stars, planets and moons.  Comets, long considered \\"debris of creation\\" might be cast aside as thoughtlessly as any other trash.  As with other rubbish tossed aside, where it lands is rarely given much thought.  Cohen and Stewart use this foundation to build a structure of many aspects, each neatly supporting the others until reaching a off-beat conclusion.<br />In presenting their story, they indulge in what can only be labelled \\"post-modern' [ugh!] characterization.  Charity and Prudence are distinctly different, despite being twins.  Charles Dunmore is the archetypal politically successful academic.  The authors spare him a formula end, but the means seems a bit thin.  Angie Carver, who becomes a prop for Prudence and Moses, has built a fortune from seven husbands.  While she claims to have loved them all, she mourns for none.  Of all the characters, Moses, so important to the story, is constructed of implausibilities.  Even the aliens are more realistically portrayed.  In fact, the Elders might have been lifted straight from Pratchett's Discworld wizards.  The story's scope, however, relegates most of the human characters to near-irrelevance.  It is the aliens who dominate, both in assertive physical power and in personality.<br />There are other minor problems with this book.  While the authors are strong scientists and use their experience to explain the forces involved, their retention of Imperial measurement [miles, feet] in the twenty-third century is pretty depressing.  It reflects, one hopes, only current marketing realities and not future forecasting.  The concept of \\"intelligent\\" atomic particles or forces is neither new nor adequately explained.  A good course in cognitive studies might have helped here.  This aspect of the science of the book left the ending rather limp.  However, this same ending is a clarion call for a sequel to Wheelers.  Look forward to it.  It is likely to be rewarding.e archetypal politically successful academic.  The authors spare him a formula end, but the means seems a bit thin.

All that's required to enjoy this book is a detached view of what constitutes \\"literature.\\"  Hollywood and other hype forms have elevated such figures as Timothy Findley, Carole Shields and Michael Ondaatje to elevated status.  Is the adulation warranted?  In most cases, according to Henighan, the answer is an emphatic negative.  These essays, derived from his reviews of literary growth in Canada over two decades, reflect a strong historical awareness.  Canada, \\"endowed by history . . .  with the literary language of the world's two most powerful empires, the British and the American,\\" was shedding its British roots just when the American \\"elephant\\" came to dominate the literary scene.  For Henighan, a sound historical context is fundamental to producing in-depth literature.  In Canada, that history was swamped by those imperial intimidations.  Canadian writing is thus constrained, with its literature, just gaining an identity, being flooded by market requirements.<br />Market became the dominant force as Canadian writing was beset by commercial ideals.  Writers falsified history to capture sales.  In the finest analytical piece in this collection, Henighan dissects two key works of the \\"transition\\" period: Michael Ondaatje's \\"The English Patient\\" and Ann Michaels' \\"Fugitive Pieces.\\" Henighan finds both clarity and obfuscation in Ondaatje's work - \\"at his best, his prose is unbeatable.\\"  Henighan faults Ondaatje for transforming history into metaphor.  Historians object to authors projecting modern values into the past.  Ondaatje commits this sin repeatedly, \\"neutering the past into harmless, ecstatic visions,\\" according to Henighan.  Using fiction as the medium is no excuse, according to Henighan, since this technique leads the reader into false views of history's lessons.  Michaels falls into the same trap by \\"anesthetising the Holocaust.\\"  He finds \\"most of Fugitive Pieces is shapeless showing-off....  The reader's role here, is \\"to make you impressed with yourself for having read\\" the book.  Not a compelling reason for taking it up.<br />In the same essay, however, Henighan depicts Jack Hodgins \\"Broken Ground\\" as a \\"deliberate inversion of The English Patient.\\"  He contends Hodgins is \\"sparring\\" with Ondaatje with his frighteningly realistic portrayal of trench warfare in WWI.  This comparison surely diminishes Hodgins' writing skills.  Hodgins is purely his own man as a writer, hardly needing Ondaatje as a foil.  It's surprising that in his later expose of the Giller and Governor General's awards Henighan overlooks the great injustice done Hodgins over this outstanding work.  This oversight is one of Henighan's few serious lapses, since he credits it as Hodgins' most exceptional book.<br />Canada's role in literature was hampered in the 90s by the rise of \\"neo-conservatism\\" typified by a public seeking \\"traditional values,\\" particularly in family matters.  Carole Shields is targeted here most stridently.  Once derided for this approach, \\"her fiction has acquired a glib pseudo-postmodern veneer . . .  her contentedly family-values vision of existence\\" is \\"cut by the sting of a certain school-marmish reproval.\\"  Henighan calls \\"The Stone Diaries\\" the \\"flagship novel of Free Trade Fiction\\" in referring to the impact of pandering to the American market.  That the book succeeded in this market is testimony to the worth of his assessments.<br />If Henighan seems to appear only negative, offending your perceived tastes in writing, never fear.  He finds treasure in regional writers - often scorned by \\"establishment\\" reviewers. Besides Hodgins, he cites Wayne Johnston, Alistair MacLeod and David Richards as prominent choices.  Unlike those Henighan faults, these writers sanitize neither history nor characters.  His agile evaluations are supported by appropriate examples.  He is perceptive and incisive at the same time, and his analysesmight be applied with equal validity in other places.  Critical reading is often difficult in the face of overwhelming and sometimes dubious marketing ploys.  Henighan's aim is to awaken readers to what they face.  He performs a needed service to all readers.

Henighan exhibits a strong sense of justice and keen powers of observation.  This collection of short stories focus on such diverse topics as revolution in Nicaragua, travelling in the Andes, and growing up in strife-ridden Columbia.  The key story is North to South, in which an Ottawa woman examines her life along the coast of Ecuador.  Henighan's prose is forceful, and he portrays a range of characters with skill.  Adding his descriptive powers in depicting the landscape, and it's easy to feel you are with the tellers of each account.  There is no detachment here, you are intimate with each of his protagonists as they impart their lives, fears, aspirations and travails.  The only thing missing is achievements.  There are no grand heroics nor meaningful obstacles overcome.<br />Nearly all Henighan's stories end abruptly.  You aren't left hanging, but a sense of unresolved crisis typifies his style.  This technique prevents you from moving quickly to the next tale as you reflect on where the teller is and what steps might be taken next.  Henighan's passionate writing may leave the unreflecting reader rather exhausted, but boredom is never a threat.  These are real people challenged by circumstances appropriate to the new worlds they've entered.  Each has made the conscious decision to intrude in alien environments.  Henighan takes us through their responses to those novel conditions with captivating skill.<br />There are those who argue that it is false to write in the voice of another gender or another culture.  Henighan refutes this contention admirably, here.  If you doubt a WASP male cannot represent the thoughts and feelings of a woman or a Latin American, this book should refute that fallacy.  He is at ease with many cultures and personalities and none of his depictions rings falsely.  The book is something to be taken up with anticipation that while there may not be relief and relaxation, there will be much fulfillment.  There are no illusions or fantasy here, but a rich treasure of thoughtful experience.nd relaxation, there will be much fulfillment.

There is certainly no single term that can encompass his superb writing abilities.  &quot;Opulent&quot; might cover his descriptive powers, but fails to address the strength of Malouf's chronicle of Frank Harland.  &quot;Gripping&quot; isn't appropriate to a life so realistically portrayed - with its tumultuous events mixed with the mundane.  Artist Frank Harland is anything but mundane, however.  Raised in a rural, hilly environment, Harland is buffeted by lasting poverty, overborne by deep loyalties to father and brothers, never losing sight of the meaning of &quot;place.&quot;  That place is the one-room house of his birth.  No matter how far he strays from that locale, it haunts his life and his paintings.  In the end, he confines himself to the &quot;Half Acre&quot; in solitary exile.  What the thesaurus fails to convey for the reviewer, Malouf's own words will keep you embedded in this real life story.<br />This early book presages why many awards are granted Malouf for his writing.  He was the first winner of the IMPAC award, the richest in publishing.  The story of Frank Harland captures the reader from the first page.  His father, an indolent dairy farmer, imparted a sense of story in Frank from his earliest days.  He applies his learning to drawing instead of text, giving a fresh image of his home and its people throughout his life.  Affected by the powers experienced in the hill country, the various intensities of light and shadow, the wonder-generating storms that beset the hills, the flora and fauna encountered, he struggles to impart his feelings to his art.  Using any available medium, Frank paints on wood, cardboard panels, paper or whatever is at hand.  The work gains wide circulation, almost unknown to Frank.  Success and fame are not his aim, however, but getting through life remains the dominant theme throughout this work.  In the background, he remains beset by &quot;place,&quot; which is translated into spending his earnings on enlarging his father's land holdings.<br />Malouf's great strength is in characterization.  Every person in this story is vividly depicted, Frank, father Clem, Tam the stepbrother and Phil the lawyer.  Would you like these people? It's doubtful.  Frank, caught up in his art, is slovenly, his various residences a chaos, his appearance ragged. Phil is hesitant, charmless and limited in scope.  Little wonder he remains unmarried throughout his life.  There is little to attract in any of these people.  Still, Malouf manages to portray them sympathetically.  His prose keeps you attentive, following their fates, no matter how distasteful their personalities might seem.  It is Malouf's honed skills that keeps this book timeless.place,&quot; which is translated into spending his earnings on enlarging his father's land holdings.<br />Malouf's great strength is in characterization.

When Darwin published The Descent of Man in 1872, he raised the issue of why so many species' males invest costly physical resources in sexual displays.  His answer was the mating game.  Peacock's tails are difficult to lug around, use material that might be better applied elsewhere in the body, and make the bird susceptible to predation.  Darwin's answer was the cost was a mating investment - peahens clearly preferred males with the most outstanding displays.  Monkeys in the forests and swamp frogs expend similar energy in calling over great distances seeking mates.  The females of these species listen, weighing some unknown factor in deciding which male to select to bear their offspring.  Can such a strategy be applied to human mating practices?<br /><br />Geoffrey Miller's answer is a resounding \\"Yes!\\"  Humans, however, are far more complex than peacocks.  In this book, Miller contends that instead of garish tails or mating calls, it is the human brain that provides the mechanisms for mate selection.  Like the peacock's tail, the human brain is a costly organ - using 20% of our resources even when resting.  Why is the brain so demanding?  It has many jobs to do, memory, vision, controlling motion and speech and directing other activities.  The human mind's most impressive abilities, Miller states, are \\"courtship tools, evolved to attract and entertain sexual partners.\\"  These \\"tools\\" include such seemingly disparate practices as sports, poetry, art and literature.  Many of these factors in our lives are the result of language development.  Why did these talents evolve, and how do they affect our mate selection?  Where some animals offer food as a mating incentive, men offer diamonds, songs or prose.  Why not offer something to eat, like a potatoe, instead of a diamond, which lacks practical value?<br /><br />Miller's argument focusses on \\"fitness factors\\" in mating strategies.  In humans these are far more complex than in the rest of animal kingdom.  In his view, the factors must be mainly expressed by the male, and by adults more than the young.  They must be elements that can be judged by females before mating, and the more vivid the presentation, the more likely the mating will be.  In human societies, the presentation may not even be displayed by the male, but may be \\"purchased\\" - hence, movies, concerts, art objects may be bought in the pursuit of females instead of actually created by the suitor.<br /><br />And what of the suitor's object of his quest?  Are human females simply gawking airheads waiting to see which male displays or buys the best offering in the mating game?  Far from it, contends Miller.  He makes the claim that will be hotly contested by feminazis, that historically, males predominate in literature, the arts and business.  Recognizing that female cognitive skills match those of human males, he argues that the female mind had to evolve in parallel with that of males'.  However, their skills reside in assessing the worth of what males are offering.  They must make the judgement of which \\"fitness factors\\" are the most attractive.  Hence, if men developed language ability to \\"show off\\" their creativity, women evolved the ability to evaluate how skillfully the men performed.  Miller's analysis is not empty rhetoric.  He reviews a broad range of behaviour patterns, attributing to each the evolutionary roots likely involved in developing them.<br /><br />Miller's prose skills are outstanding in this valuable survey.  His use of metaphor keeps you smiling as he presents his case.  He transforms a Satin Bowerbird into an effete artist at one point.  This comical account has the bird, expressing himself just as a Letterman guest might, explaining why the bower nest is under constant niggling attention by the male until its arrangement successfully attracts a mate.  It's indicative of Miller's high quality imagination.  Make no mistake, however, this book isn't just a frolic promoting Miller's abilities as a raconteur.  His message is serious, and what he's proposed requires serious reflection.  His thesis explains many facets of the human condition and must be considered earnestly.

Here, he certainly has no peer in providing a comprehensive history of evolutionary biology without descending into the acrimony and vituperation that has plagued the field.  He opens  with a review of &quot;the science wars,&quot; particularly the humanities' assault on science over the past generation.  He chooses evolutionary thought for his focus, because he's familiar with the topic, having addressed several books to the field.  In this book, he evokes the work of twelve scholars in assessing the impact of &quot;culture&quot; on evolutionary research.<br />As Ruse sees it, &quot;the debate is between objectivity and subjectivity.&quot;  These &quot;scientific values&quot; are used in reviewing the work of his chosen personalities.  They are assessed in light of his overview of Karl Popper's &quot;objectivism&quot; versus Thomas Kuhn's &quot;paradigms of thought.&quot;  Ruse follows the tortured path of this debate with compelling skill.  His guidance is sure-footed, keeping our attention and maintaining a balanced course along the way.  It's a perilous journey, since many of the personalities are current and none hesitant about making known their displeasure.  Stephen Gould, Richard Dawkins, Richard Lewontin and Edward Wilson have all tilted at the academic lists.  Ruse negotiates this hazardous milieu effectively.<br />Ruse synthesizes many works in assessing the cultural milieu of each of his subjects.  Darwin's comfortable upper-middle class lifestyle, Gould's rampant Marxism, Wilson's Southern fundamentalist upbringing have been examined by many others over the years.  Ruse adds a fresh level of organization to these accounts, giving each of his subjects a &quot;level playing field&quot; position as he relates them to the larger issue.  He faults none of them, for none consciously sought to inflict a social standard on society.  They were all men of their times, writing to an audience they understood.  Although Ruse has some mild reservations about the &quot;popularization&quot; of science by such figures as Dawkins, Gould or even Ed Wilson, he doesn't openly condemn them, nor does he feel they're honing axes.  He understands the need for science to reach a broad public, even at the risk of flawed comprehension.<br />As a philosopher, Ruse's conclusion may surprise the unwary. He finds the charge of &quot;cultural determinism&quot; wanting, especially among today's active scientists.  The quest for objectivity has intensified over succeeding generations to become the fully established standard.  Is the assault on science responsible for tightening the discipline of its practitioners?  Again, Ruse rebuffs the claims of the deconstructionists, arguing that science, by the very nature of its practices, has provided a core of self-discipline improving the way in which science is reported by its members.  Even if they stray from the norm in other ways, it isn't the impact of &quot;cultural&quot; mores that tempts them from the path of full objectivity.  Ruse deserves full accolades for this study, long needed to counter the foolish assaults science and<br />scientists have endured.Although Ruse has some mild reservations about the &quot;popularization&quot; of science by such figures as Dawkins, Gould or even Ed Wilson, he doesn't openly condemn them, nor does he feel they're honing axes.

Years ago, we watched, through blurred vison, Peter Sellers in Doctor Strangelove.  The blurring was either from the hilarity or the grief the film inspired.  The dialogue could double us over with mirth, while the story directly confronted us with our mortality and that control of our fate resided with such devious leaders.  Greg Palast evokes an identical response.  He chronicles the stolen election of the worlds most powerful leader, how the International Monetary Fund and World Band exercise immense control over national destinies, and how the rich increase their influence and income at our expence.  He keeps us charmed with his wit, while reminding us of our near-helplessness in the face of mighty, but hidden, forces.<br />Every essay in this collection jolts the reader.  Its like turning over a rock or breaking open a rotten log - the ugly grubs exposed bring revulsion and dismay.  How does life produce such distasteful creatures?  Palast exposes the putrid path of the Bush dynasty, the betrayal of the British voters by \\"New Labour\\" and the intrigues of international corporations in Asia, Africa, Latin America.  How, he asks, do we allow these people to gain their ascendancy over our lives?  One answer lies within our favourite ideal community - the small, rural, American town.  There, he notes, avaricious investors have overturned local attempts to retain their values to instil the symbols of corporate enterprise - McArches, Wal-malls and chiming tacos.  These blights on our landscape are made welcome - \\"they boost the economy\\"!<br />Palasts concluding set of essays, how the Blair government sold out the British populace would bring tears to the hardiest.  He shows how corporate executives and their agents have become an \\"arm of government\\" in policy making and implemetation.  The arm has a long reach, extending from New York banks and government offices in Washington.  Centre to these revealing articles is the overthrow of a tax on shopping mall car parks.  The deal, engineered by a major corporation was part of an overall plan to \\"head the [Labour] government in a different direction.\\"  In other words, reverse the policies that were the foundation of Labours successes at the polls.  Blairs real foundation is \\"Americas enterpreneurialism,\\" the drive for global markets which \\"projects corporate powers onto one tiny, cold island\\" welcomed by its \\"always-grinning native chief.\\"  Blair prides himself on \\"listening to industry\\" before formulating policy.<br />Palast has few peers as an investigative journalist.  Of necessity, he must shield his sources, which keeps us mildly suspicious.  Are things really THAT bad?  Unfortunately, as time passes, his assertions are substantiated, restoring our faith in his reporting.  As an investigative journalist, the solutions for many of the social ills he reports are lacking here.  And so they should - the solutions lie with his readers.

The excursion examines nearly every aspect of women's bodies, with many mysteries unveiled and hidden facets exposed.  She mixes clinical findings with emotional responses in a rich set of information, and no little opinion on meanings.  There are countless insights here, and her talent with words makes the reading an easy task.  It's a pity her introduction pays only condescending consideration to the value this book might have for male readers.  There's treasure here for anyone who wishes to understand the poorly dealt with aspects of what it means to be a woman.<br />While her exposition covers an extensive array of topics, perhaps the chapter on hormones is of greatest value.  Spending much of her time dispensing with what she deems mythology, she underpins her opinions with a hefty dose of information on which hormones are important to a woman's well-being.  It's a comprehensive view of the human body's operations reaching well beyond either pure biology or medicine.  Still, the information applies to all human bodies, depending on the hormone, reaching well beyond her expressed, if confined, audience.  We all need to better understand what is going on in our bodies.<br />Angier threads personal experiences into the narrative with practiced ease.  Her prose is witty and inventive, fertile with metaphor.  She's present on almost every page, although there is nothing obtrusive in learning she suffers a thyroid condition, nor in standing with her in an operating theatre.  Instead, her personal occurrences bring us closer to the humanity she imparts with these examples.  They are situations many women experience, yet occuring without women being told of their cause and likely impact.  She uses many of these examples in her attempts to dispel the mythology surrounding many women's physical conditions.<br />Angier's eloquence may dazzle the unwary, but the careful reader will discern a wealth of inconsistencies.  She's at pains to demonstrate her knowledge of the Darwinian paradigm.  Unfortunately, her feminist rhetoric trips up her ambition for scientific detachment.  Glorying in the massive nerve network of the clitoris compared to the penis, she exults: \\"Who would want a shotgun when you can have a semi-automatic?\\"  This invidious contrast ignores that it was evolution that granted these gender differences.  Neither sex has had a conscious choice in their physiognomy.  She ranges over many scientific achievements in revealing the body's features, ignoring that men performed the significant amount of the research available to make this book.  Learning the biology and considering our evolutionary roots is rewarding, but the aim of elevating women is undercut by disparaging men.<br />The book, therefore, is only a qualified success.  For a book based on scientific research, her failure to provide references is startling.  She calls her bibliography \\"References\\" but it takes a serious student to pursue her sources.  After building her credibility with a wide-ranging and vivid narrative, in the final chapters she nearly throws it all away.  From her crusade to inform us about what's important to and about women, she suddenly elevates her soapbox with a vituperative assault on evolutionary psychology.  This is a strange departure, since she's spent much of her text reassuring us of her Darwinian credentials.  In this onslaught, she's suddenly given to misquotes, out of context citations and very selective research results.  With so much complex information presented in the remainder of the book, she suddenly disturbingly simplifies here.  Her celebration of the woman's body and psyche is badly marred by her insistence that as \\"a free and fiery primate\\" knowledgeable women will attain supremacy over the world's problems.  Dismissing a wealth of work done in recent years on primate behaviour alone is not the way to increase the knowledgestore.store.	2002-09-02

Darwin appended his earlier ideas outlined in The Origin of Species in  The Descent of Man.  In that later work, he enalrged on the idea of \\"sexual selection.\\"  He postulated that many evolutionary traits which appear as maladaptive to survival are actually derived from reproductive pressures.  The issue of female choice among many species was a difficult idea to sell - Wallace never accepted it.  He retained what Cronin deems \\"natural selection by<br />good sense,\\" devoid of esthetics.<br />Cronin chronicles the history of sexual selection with craft and precision.  Her writing is unambiguous, providing excellent insights into many aspects of evolutionary thinking.  As she develops her theme, she aknowledges her debt to Dawkin's work on the influence of genes manifesting as guides to adaptation.  Cronin adds a new term in describing the merging of Mendelian genetics and Darwin's gradualist concept - \\"modern Darwism\\".  She carefully explains how natural selection operates at the genetic level to achieve a \\"trade-off\\" of costs and benefits to arrive at selected traits.  In this analysis, Cronin gently but firmly applies Darwinian implements to show how critics of modern Darwinism have misled themselves in seeking \\"alternative\\" answers to adapation.  The have been asking the wrong questions!<br /> This view was hotly challenged by paleontologist Stephen Gould in a now-famous essay.  He viewed with horror Cronin's application of gene selection as a definitive evolutionary process.  He made a wide-ranging critique which attempted to refute applying any facets of animal behaviour to humans.  The review touched off the [mostly] trans-Atlantic dispute over how adaptation actually works.  It was the Sarajevo of the \\"Darwin Wars\\" between Gould and Dawkins, perhaps best summarized by Daniel Dennet.  Cronin's use of evidence should have forestalled that conflict.  Cronin's skills in applying essentials to explain adaptations are unimpeachable and her skillful prose only enhances the value of this work.  It will stand for a long time as a landmark work in evolutionary studies.mostly] trans-Atlantic dispute over how adaptation actually works.

In this series of interviews, conducted by various international journalists, he demonstrates his knowledgeable grasp of the realities of \\"terrorism.\\"  From the outset, he makes clear that definitions of \\"terrorism\\" must include the United States with its history of state-supported acts in various countries, most particularly in the Middle East.  He makes us aware that the Middle East population is cognizant of American activities there, even as the bulk of the American public is not.  He steadfastly refutes the belief, held by many American intellectuals, that the World Trade Centre attacks are due to resentment over the American push for a \\"globalized economy.\\"<br />Chomsky recognizes that the WTC attacks were unique - never before had an assault been carried out directly on American territory.  Pearl Harbour cannot be equated with the 9/11 attack.  He cautions that the attacks were not carried out at the direction of a foreign nation.  There is no state of war with another country, and the term \\"war on terror\\" is merely political sophistry.  Nor, as he reminds his interviewers, is Amerika alone in its negative impact in the Middle East and elsewhere.  Each of his interviewers is reminded of the history of their nations in colonial and post-colonial eras.<br />Amerikan machinations were designed to foster the very forces opposed to them now.  Saudi Arabia has been a \\"client state\\" of the US since its founding.  The Taliban were supported so long as they represented anti-Soviet policies in Afghanistan.  And that personification of Evil, Saddam Hussein was provided with weapons, advice and money in his campaign against the Ayatollahs Iraq.  He stresses the inconsistencies in Amerikan policies.  When Oklahoma Citys bombing occurred and militia groups in Montana and Idaho were identified as likely funders, why werent those states bombed and their governments deposed?  Equally, Britain would have been justified in bombing Boston, a major source of funds for the IRA.<br />What, then, is Chomskys recommended course of action?  He reminds us that the United States is the only nation that has been reprimanded by the World Court for acts of terrorism against Nicaragua.  Although the United States \\"dismissed that courts judgement with contempt,\\" Chomsky argues for adherence to international agreements and conventions.

Like others before him, he was caught by whimsical nature of this most awesome phenomenon.  It erupted, taking the lives of six of his colleagues; Williams was perched just over the rim of the crater.  Williams, to his own amazement, survived, but remains of some of his friends and co-workers were never found.  This book is a testament to the few courageous scientists around the world who climb and investigate these capricious mountains.  Williams captivates the reader with the subject of volcanology and descriptions of those who brave the risks to study the goddess Pele's offspring.<br />In telling his own story of risk, injury and survival, Williams recounts his life and his colleagues' around the world.  They come from many lands - Russia, Italy, Columbia and other regions beset by earth's upheavals.  Williams, almost an anomaly as a native of Illinois - far from any volcanic activity [except, perhaps, politically], is intensely dedicated to the science.  He describes the various volcanic processes and the impact volcanoes have had down the ages.  The aim of the studies is to learn how to forecast eruptions.  A major success in that endeavour was the saving of thousands of lives when the Philippine mountain Pinatubo erupted in 1991.  Galeras, the Columbian volcano that nearly took Williams life, is neighbour to a town of three hundred thousand, Pasto.  Attempts to instill evacuation programmes there was met with derision and resentment - it would hurt business.<br />Williams' accounts of volcano disasters make enthralling reading.  From Pliny the Younger's attempt to rescue his uncle during Pompeii's famous outburst to modern eruptions, the failure of human populations to accommodate the threat are vivid examples of short-sighted views.  Williams stresses the obvious threats, lava flows, \\"pyroclastic\\" flows of mud, ash and rocks mixed with toxic gases.  He also recounts poorly recognized after effects the debris can evoke - chemical poisonings and crop and herd losses.  Famine is a regular result of volcanic activity.  Volcanoes are capable of global climate impact, the most famous being the 1815  Tambora explosion resulting in New England's \\"Year Without A Summer\\" which devastated crops and herds over wide areas.  Williams attributes the wave of Western expansion to the impact of an eruption \\"a world away.\\"<br />As a combined personal account and scientific study, there are few faults in this book.  One can only hope someone derives a synonym for \\"pyroclastic flows\\" someday.  Williams feelings about the event and the subsequent lives of the survivors are told with intense feeling.  One can only sympathise with his distress at losing friends and co-workers and how the families bore up under the stress.  His historical accounts cover both fact and mythology.  Strangely, although Williams describes many of the gods associated with vulcanism, he omits the only American deity - Pele.  As capricious as the Hawaiian goddess is, Williams reminds us that the island volcanoes don't threaten explosive eruptions.  While that might offer some mild comfort to that State, Mammoth Mountain in California remains an unheralded threat to thousands in the Golden State.and rocks mixed with toxic gases.

This leading primatologist has collected a series of essays on primate behaviour in an outstanding effort aimed at answering that question.  De Waal's credentials as a student of chimpanzee behaviour are well-known.  He's joined here by researchers of equal status in presenting the most recent findings in the field.  De Waal states in the Introduction that research in human behaviour falls into two camps - human beings are an entirely unique species or human evolutionary roots are visible in many of our related species.  He and his fellow essayists adhere to the second theme, the one that has gained significant adherence over the past several decades of research.  \\"The proliferation of research on monkeys and apes . . . has influenced the way we look at our place in nature.\\"<br />This collection brings to view much of that research, a compendium long overdue in de Waal's estimation.  His team provides new insights into primate behaviour.  They combine the research finding with speculations on how modern monkeys and apes reflect the evolutionary roots of our own relations with each other.  The topics covered show the impact of environment, the patterns of sex and reproduction, social organization and cognition.  The collection addresses the \\"process of hominization\\" leading from ape-like ancestors to modern humans.  If all this sounds like a series of lofty scientific pedantry, fear not.  All the authors present their information in open, conversational style.  Although the result of a scholarly seminar, the writing throughout is clear and unpretentious.  Anyone interested in their evolutionary roots or in the status of the research will find this collection rewarding.<br />The quality of this compilation makes choice of place difficult, if not impossible.  Each author presents new information and delightful analyses of the importance of the findings.  Craig Stanford discusses the role of meat eating [not hunting] in building social relationships.  Studied closely in the field in both ape and human societies, meat distribution and sex have a clear evolutionary role.  Richard Wrangham carries this theme a step further in his analysis of the social role of food preparation - cooking.  He stresses how early cooking must have emerged in hominid evolution and what its likely social impact was in our development.  Richard Byrne extends this analysis to describe several forms of food acquisition and processing among various primate species.<br />If any issue transcends the others in the role of humanity, it is that of human cognition.  To those contending only human cognitive abilities are worth studying, several authors respond that \\"evolution does not proceed by inspired jumps . . . but by accretion of beneficial variants\\" over time.  In order to comprehend the evolutionary path of cognition, definitions are of primary importance.  Cognition is here defined as \\"a species' package of information-processing capabilities\\" encompassing individual, social, technical and other skills.  Robin Dunbar shows how these skills were likely reinforced through selectively chosen group size.  He examines variations in primate group size and how these impact social behavior.  Charles Snowdon addresses the mainstay of human \\"uniqueness\\" in an outline of language<br />development.  In the final essay, William McGrew considers the question of \\"culture.\\"  What is it and how was it derived?  McGrew refers to eight criteria, developed many years ago by Alfred Koeber, and applies them in a historical context.  McGrew emphasizes that humans are not the only social species.  Language enhanced abilities inherited from our predecessors.<br />This book addresses older ideas and breaks new ground.  With a strong foundation in the intensive primate studies achieved during the past three decades, the collection calls for further studies in the field.  What these will bring to light will increase our knowledge of where we fit in Nature.  There are assuredly many surprises remaining to be revealed.  Will you help search for answers to some of these questions?owledge of where we fit in Nature.  There are assuredly many surprises remaining to be revealed.

This lightly told, but hardly frivolous, study of the mind/brain refutes many long-held notions of what comprises the conscious mind.  Gazzinga's approach is an attempt to inform us all of the real status of &quot;self.&quot;  He contends the &quot;self&quot; - hence, &quot;free will&quot; is a conceit.  We pretend to have consciousness through our desire to establish identity, but the brain has its own, hidden, mechanisms of which we are only now becoming aware.  He stresses the evolutionary roots of our minds, roots which may not compel behaviour, but certainly drive it with forces we fail to perceive readily.  It's an amazingly complete work in spite of its brevity, rewarding to anyone opening its pages.<br />Gazzaniga is a clinical researcher, not a field worker.  This doesn't impede his stressing an evolutionary development for how our minds work.  Gazzaniga posits an &quot;interpreter&quot; as residing within our left brains.  The distinctive roles of the left and right halves of the brain have been the subject of intensive research during the past years, but his assessment has some novelty.  It is rather more than the classical &quot;Cartesian Theatre&quot; which has held sway in the minds of many psychologists and philosophers over the years.  Gazzaniga's &quot;interpreter&quot; outperforms the role of &quot;observer&quot; postulated by Descartes.  It has moved from Descartes' pineal gland to the left cortex.  In Gazzaniga's view, the &quot;interpreter&quot; has a more active role, even powered to stimulate activity in sensory areas, previously thought to be wholly reactive.  This device is rooted in our animal ancestors, living in a dangerous environment, needing to predict events for survival and reproduction.  We have progressed beyond those roots, but the function has had long career, according to Gazzaniga.  He stresses that we must learn more about its abilities and operations.<br />His use of sources is awkward.  While utilizing the work of numerous researchers in his account, his attributions are hazy.  The appended notes are collected by chapters, but relating the list to the text is difficult.  Countless workers noted in the text fail to appear in the notes. We have only Gazzaniga's assurances that his references are valid.  While his approach makes for easy readability, one's own &quot;interpreter&quot; sits uncomfortable at these omissions.  Many well-known figures in consciousness studies are omitted.  He builds a superb case, but it seems to rest on a shaky foundation.  Still, his assertions need response and it will be fascinating to see who answers his contentions.researchers in his account, his attributions are hazy.

Despite a throng of recent critics attempting to discredit Gregor Mendel's role as the founder of modern genetic sciences, Tudge provides a wealth of supportive data to reinforce Mendel's reputation.  Although some critics have disparaged Mendel's lack of scholastic acceditations, Tudge urges a comprehensive view.  He stresses we should look at Mendel's environment, personal background and, most importantly his scientific methods.  Tudge simply sweeps away the criticisms [with the sole exception of R.A. Fisher] as unthinking iconoclasm.<br /> After a defence of Mendel and his contribution to biology, Tudge reviews what genes are and how they function.  This in-depth overview is one of the best summations of genetic processes in print.  This chapter alone is worth purchasing the book.  Tudge traces the roles of DNA, RNA, the amino acids and proteins.  He shows how even minuscule changes in any step in the sequence can lead to ineffective proteins.  Such changes can be implemented in the development of the organism [or merely part of it] rendering it unfit to survive in its existing environment.  Such change can also make the individual more fit if that environment is undergoing change.  He reviews the history of discoveries concerning chromosomes, DNA [first called nuclein], enzymes and proteins.  He reminds us that many of these finds were made while Mendel's work had sunk from sight.  Tudge's list of the  researchers involved and the dates of their discoveries is revealing for those not well-grounded in the history of biology.  He shows how the many threads were brought together many years later.<br />Tudge addresses how the genetic ratios imply regular laws of inheritance.  Tudge stresses the revolutionary aspect of this discovery and how it changed science's view of life.  He notes how Mendelian genetics seemed to refute Darwin for some years.  When these apparent discrepancies were later reconciled and molecular genetics arose as the science binding the two theories, limitless opportunities arose.  Revelation of the DNA structure showed how genes could be identified and later used to understand their relation to the whole organism.<br />Tudge follows through with what has been achieved in genetic research and speculates on what the future might hold.  He pulls no punches in his speculations and readers will be confronted with myriad possibilities.  These shouldn't be discounted nor blithely cast aside as distasteful.  His proposals are realistic and based on strong science.<br />This book should stand as Tudge's finest effort.  He's written many books on science, with some focus on human evolution.  Standing as a pinnacle among his publications, readers are urged to take up this volume intending to give it a careful read.  His Epilogue carefully reviews the many ethical questions that arise from the new power that genetics has placed in our hands.  He reminds us of the pitfalls that have been encountered in the past and to prepare for these in decision-making.  Public policies, which ultimately rest in your hands, he reminds us, must be formulated on a basis of clear understanding of what is involved.<br />This book provides an excellent starting point for building that knowledge base.

If Mark Twain had produced this story we would be smiling at the bizarre characterization and twisted plot.  A deranged killer, comfortably incarcerated as he participates in an immense intellectual endeavour.  That Winchester's tale is valid history instead invokes sadness and consternation.  What bends a man's mind past the breaking point?  Is a single event sufficient cause, or does it require a sequence of circumstances?  If broken, must we believe that mind of no further use?  Winchester's history of William Minor not only is a superb read, it shows that only extraordinary circumstances can overcome the condition of the mentally disturbed.  Minor, through a fluke, restored meaning to his incarceration through his contributions to the Oxford English Dictionary.  Winchester has performed a noteworthy service in this uncanny work.  His long-standing journalist's skills are given full rein as he canters through Minor's life in Asia, the American War Between the States and the long years in Britain's Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum.<br />Winchester feeds us tidbits of Minor's life as the story progresses.  Born in what is now Sri Lanka, Minor's early life is almost a tale of fantasy in its own right.  Winchester attributes the tropical lifestyle to sowing the seeds of Minor's later madness.  The seed flourished during the American Civil War, heavily fertilized with the blood of soldiers fallen during the Wilderness Campaign in Virginia.  According to Winchester, the branding of an AWOL Irish soldier led to the madness bearing its fruit in the mistaken murder of a passerby in London.  The mindless killing led to his incarceration in Broadmoor.  While there, he became one of the principal contributors to the building of the O.E.D.<br />Winchester stresses what an immense task compiling a full dictionary of the English language was - something we take for granted now - non-existent in Shakespeare's day.  The O.E.D.'s editor, James Murray, recognized Minor's contributions as particularly insightful and valuable.  Minor had his own method of tracking and classifying words and was able to fulfill Murray's needs in a way that far outstripped the other suppliers.  Murray sought out Minor to acknowledge his efforts.  It was an unusual association for the time - particularly in the face of Minor's continuing fantasies of persecution.<br />Winchester's use of definitions as chapter headings is an effective lead-in to the main text.  His own word skills aren't wanting, and his descriptive prowess is excellent.  Sprinkled with line drawings, the graphics help convey the feeling of the era.  If there is a flaw in this book, it's in the lack of an index.  A history without an index is incomplete.  Still, it's the story that demands attention, which any reader will freely give that as this exemplary narrative progresses.  He manages to weave a needed sample of an individual's history within a wider, but comprehensive picture.  More accounts of noteworthy, but previously unknown people are needed.

Metaphor is her bow, with anthropomorphism a valuable arrow in her quiver.  Enzymes become muscular bodyguards, orchids are lazy, deceptive, or magnanimous and scorpions can be \\"model spouses and parents.\\"  Such imagry will leave many \\"bench scientists\\" aghast at her \\"softening\\" the science, but others, and we readers, applaud her ability at stripping away the arcane aspects of dealing with Nature's wonders.  She exposes life with a fresh view, making us intimate with its wonders and coming away with enhanced interest to learn more.  That is precisely her aim and she scores a bullseye with every essay.<br />She has grouped the essays into seven major topic areas ranging from adapting to slithering.  The categories cover genetic mechanisms DNA uses through mating practices to the ultimate \\"subject that knows no species boundaries, the cloak with room to cover us all - death.\\"  Before arriving at this terminal condition, however, Angier is able to sprinkle petals of flowery prose on prolonging life.  In \\"Why Vegetables Are Good For You,\\" she provides new information on plant chemistry's impact on our bodies.  That dread aspect of civilized life, fat, is also given attention - and its due.  You will be delighted with her revelations on \\"adipose pucker.\\"<br />After a set of paeans celebrating various practicing scientists, Angier finally turns to the \\"great mystery\\" - the ending of life.  \\"Cell death is universal to life,\\" she begins.  Demonstrating its necessity in allowing evolution to proceed, she proceeds to relate how the process of cell death provides insights in the diagnosis and treatment of various afflictions.  In tracking the mechanisms leading to the demise of various cells, particularly within our immune system, reseachers have found new genetic signals that keep our bodies healthy.  Otherwise, we would be likely to self-destruct.  It's a fine balance kept continually on a fine tightrope.  Yet, after aknowledging its necessity, Angier doesn`t accept there's such a thing as \\"a good way to die.\\"  The loss of a friend leads her to express the mechanism of the AIDS<br />virus and the epidemic's effect on social thinking.<br />Angier's imaginative essays provide a wealth of topics for further thought, even investigation.  It's a pity she failed to provide any supportive reading suggestions.  Many of her essays discuss the researchers while omitting to identify them.  There's no reason to discount the facts she provides for our enjoyment and edification, but pursuit of a chosen topic is impeded by lack of pointers.  That shortcoming is alleviated only by the fact that an index is provided.  However, the range of topics and Angier's prose nearly overcome the lack of a bibliography.after aknowledging its necessity, Angier doesn`t accept there's such a thing as \\"a good way to die.\\"  The loss of a friend leads her to express the mechanism of the AIDS <BR>virus and the epidemic's effect on social thinking.<br />Angier's imaginative essays provide a wealth of topics for further thought, even investigation.

For those unfamiliar with evolutionary theories, there are two contesting ideas about the process.  One is Charles Darwin's gradual thesis - successive generations change imperceptibly until a new species emerges.  The other is \\"punctuated equilibrium\\" - long periods of stasis interrupted by sudden modifications resulting in new lifeforms.  The latter, introduced by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge - Jay Niles in Bear's book - has received a new, fictional boost in this compelling novel.  Greg Bear has found out why the rise of modern humans in the paleoanthropological record.  It's because a virus-like manifestation of our DNA causes immense changes in the genome.  Discovering this, in a world where viruses such as AIDS makes rampant, high-velocity changes in its genome, is a formidable task.<br />Bear has restored a strong scientific base to \\"science fiction\\" where it has languished too often in the hands of the inept.  He merges good biology with a strong assessment of a society under extreme stress.  The characters are often buffeted by forces inadequately understood.  The chief protagonist, Mitch Rafelson, opens the story as an acquisitive villain, his greed tempered by a desire to prove himself a valid researcher.  On the feminist side [a must in today's fiction] is Kaye Lang - her married name which takes over forty pages to reveal - is also a scientist.  Her work, unblemished, is considered Nobel material.  Bringing these two together requires some convoluted machinations, but Bear manages to bring it off after a suicide and bureaucratic ineptness lead to the inevitable.  They're an oddly matched couple, but two lonely people in the hands of a talented writer can overcome indominable odds.  Especially when confronted by a powerful common enemy.<br />The story rests on how bureaucracies respond to stress.  In this case the stress is dealing with a virus striking only women.  Why are so many American [and other nationalities, but we'll get to that later] conceiving but losing embryoes?  Worse, why is it happening in tandem, with second pregnancies in many cases not the result of sex?  Bear takes us through the workings of many of America's health agencies, their workings and their personnel as the story unfolds.  The image is far from encouraging, but not overdrawn.  Chris Dicken, a functionary in one of these hierarchical satrapies, is caught up in a search for truth while<br />struggling to maintain his position.  Bear draws Dicken as well, if not better, than the rest of his characters.  His situation is complicated by his desire for Kaye, and Bear gives us a quality picture of a man beset by immense contradictions.  In Dicken, Bear gives us a real picture of hubris,  a portrait untrammeled by false ethics or marred by unconvincing powers.<br />Bear's scientific credentials provide a rare solidity to his fine story line in this book.  If there's a flaw, it's in his failure to invoke some mention of world reaction to this phenomenal crisis.  Since most of the characters find occasion to watch the news, it's almost astonishing that foreign reaction, particularly in the \\"Third World\\" is omitted altogether.  What is astounding is his utter failure to relate conditions in Africa.  That continent, after all, is the home to modern humanity.  Its population contains the highest genetic diversity.  If clues were to be found to explain what might be happening in America in the novel, that would be the place to find them.  It's a very \\"American\\" book, looking deeply inward while ignoring the remainder of the planet.  Brief forays into the former Soviet Georgia, Mexico, and, indirectly, Austria don't redeem this flaw.  However, one can forgive this lapse in the face of a gripping story, realistic portrayals and the compelling finale.  Bear is worth all his awards.conceiving but losing embryoes?

Why do many patients suffering from stroke-induced paralysis insist they are still fully capable of performing physical acts?  Why do so many people insist they've had a &quot;religious experience&quot; in the face of all logic?  Rama has pursued these questions for many<br />years and offers us a comprehensive review of his findings and his explanations for these phenomena.<br />It is easy to see from this book why so many people seek Rama's counsel when suffering from neurological disorder.  His unpretensious style, abstaining from complex technology when simpler forms of therapy are at hand, his undogmatic approach obviously grant him a superb &quot;bedside manner.&quot;  He is evidently not above abandoning traditional techniques or philosophies in approaching medical problems.  His openly confessed desire to unravel mysteries that have eluded other researchers gives him an edge in arriving at solutions, no matter how bizarre the solutions appear.  The resulting narrative is fresh and stimulating for all readers.<br />Rama's many cases presented here demonstrate how much more flexible the brain is than has been conceded by most other researchers.  If adult brains can &quot;remap&quot; sensory paths in the face of devastating phsysical injury, then many ideas about the evolutionary development of the human intellect must be reconsidered.  Rama, unlike most of his colleagues, is willing to examine the evolutionary roots of the mind in assessing his findings.  He accepts a strong genetic basis for our cognitive skills, still aknowledging the impact of conditioning.  It's a middle-of-the-road stance, somewhat marred by his unwarrented assault on evolutionary psychology.  One can only wish that he'd also cited some of the recent research on the Hox genes which lay down the rules for body formation.  If the Hox genes map arms, legs and ears, there is likely some impact on how the brain maps the body, as well.  Rama ignores this situation, an amazing omission given his neurological foundation.<br />His more serious stumbles occur in his attempts to equate neurological phenomena with philosophical ramifications of his work.  His addressing of cognitive science issues tends to erode much of his presentation.  In reflecting how the brain deals with physiological subjects, he reverts to discredited traditional terms in dealing with areas he hasn't fully resolved.  He finds &quot;robots&quot; in the mind which act as &quot;alter egos&quot; and unconsciously direct the brain's responses to unusual physical conditions.  Rather than confess to ignorance of how these unexplained operations occur, he finds it more compelling to fall back on the &quot;zombie&quot; interpretation, which has no validity.<br />He compounds this misdirection in his concluding chapter [&quot;Do Martians See Red?&quot;] with outmoded references to &quot;qualia.&quot;  In short, &quot;qualia&quot; is a term applied to undefinable, but commonly accepted personal perceptions of the world around us - &quot;red&quot;or &quot;taste&quot; or &quot;centres of gravity.&quot;  We all think we can define these manifestations, but on closer inspection, we realize these are indefinable.  We think we know what they are, but they elude fixation.  For Ramachandran to persist in touting &quot;qualia&quot; as a meaningful term is a surprising lapse in an otherwise excellent book.

His books and lectures cover an extensive span of time.  Here he has given us a brilliantly constructed overview of the history of thinking on evolution and how it operates.  While there is a stunning amount of detail in this book, it so clearly presented that it doesn't overwhelm the reader.  His Preface targets his readers as anyone interested in evolution, those seeking clarification of the &quot;Darwin Wars&quot; - does Darwin's thesis require clarification or modification, and, finally, the creationists.  The remainder of the book addresses that broad audience effectively.<br />Mayr gives a brief history of thinkers and their ideas about change over time.  From an introduction to Darwin's inspiration, he lists the evidence supporting evolution in the fossils, the radioactive and molecular clocks, embryology and geographical aspects.  Throughout the presentation he demonstrates how Darwin's postulate has been strengthened over the years.  Even when Mendelian genetics appeared to refute Darwin's, Mayr shows how further research proved that the two ideas merged resulting in the &quot;New Synthesis.&quot;  From that breakthrough, Darwin's idea has become irrefutable.  Evolution as Nature's fundamental manner of continuing life, from the simple to the complex.<br />Mayr's description of the process of evolution is comprehensive and lucidly presented.  Mayr adroitly reaches the widest possible audience with this work.  He addresses the question of how selection works, stressing the role of the individual, while explaining the role of groups and other factors.  He introduces the concept of dual group selection as &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft,&quot; depending on whether the grouping is &quot;cohesive&quot; or &quot;casual.&quot;  In explaining the selection process, he introduces the Biological Species Concept he authored years ago - interbreeding populations separated from other such groups.<br />Any discussion of evolution cannot overlook Darwin's original concept of evolution acting gradually over a long span of time.  After a discussion of macroevolution and other discontinuities, he addresses Eldredge and Gould's &quot;punctuated equilibria.&quot;  He easily dismisses their long-held idea as simply a misinterpretation of the fossil record.  &quot;Speciational evolution is at every step a gradual populational process,&quot; he asserts, explaining why this must be so.<br />Many readers will seek some rigid definitions to apply to evolution, equating this biological process with the &quot;laws&quot; of physics and chemistry.  Mayr recounts some of the attempts to codify evolution, but dismisses them as &quot;empirical generalizations,&quot; useful only for ordering observations and seeking causal elements.  He follows this with a discussion of &quot;contingency&quot; versus &quot;adaptation.&quot;  Mayr deals with this almost witless controversy with a simple amalgamation of the positions - &quot;natural selection is a two-step process&quot; accommodating both positions.  This section is a testament to Mayr's organized thinking and compelling prose skills.  His discussion stresses the &quot;power of the Darwinian process.&quot;<br />It's more than a little depressing that this dean of evolutionary studies felt compelled to publish this book in refutation of the new creationist wave.  Mayr should have been able to describe evolution purely on its own merits.  Yet, he recognizes the forces organized to reduce Darwin's impact on the study of life.  He addresses the wide-spread application of Darwin's idea in many areas of existence from the remote to the everyday.  He shows how recent gains in information about how life develops, the workings of the nervous system and environmental balance are the result of Darwin's concept.  For those who still harbour doubts, he concludes with an appendix of common questions addressing the Darwinian paradigm.  This book is long overdue, but its arrival should be greeted with the warmest welcome.This book is long overdue, but its arrival should be greeted with the warmest welcome.	2002-08-04

Margulis and Schwartz describe it as &quot;a catalog of the world's living diversity.&quot;  It is a vividly descriptive assortment of selected examples from the Five Kingdoms of life formulated by R.H. Whittiker.  The authors stress how much new knowledge, particularly in the study of unicellular life forms, has been gained in recent years.  They explain how classification identifies organisms and show how modern techniques have led to the expansion of life's kingdoms from two to five.  A description of prokaryotes and eucaryotes is given, followed by the body of 92 phyla descriptions.  The book is arranged to be either studied as a reference or browsed as an introduction to biological forms.  Each entry is carefully organized with the type of information [environment, measurement scales, diagrams] in a consistent location.<br />However, this is more than simply a collection of illustrative examples of various organisms. The most fascinating chapter relates the authors' proposal to modify one of the standard classifications of life - the Protoctists, replacing Whittiker's Protists.  &quot;The Kingdom Protoctista is defined by exclusion,&quot; they state.  &quot;Its members are neither animals, plants, fungi nor procaryotes.&quot;  Their common characteristics are nucleated cells, some kind of flagellum and live in an oxygenated  atmosphere [unlike many unicellular forms which cannot tolerate oxygen.  Their argument contends that many multicellular forms are more<br />directly related to these unicellular forms than they are to other multi-celled organisms.  The new classification &quot;also solves the problem of blurred boundaries that arises if the unicellular organisms are assigned to the multicellular kingdoms.&quot;  They list 27 phyla [of 36 total]with diagrams exhibiting a range of bizarre structures and life cycles.<br />Another noteworthy entry is Trichoplax adhaerens.  Remember the name of this creature - &quot;it is the simplest of animals.&quot;  Composed of but a few thousand cells, it is a dull gray body just visible to the unaided eye.  In looking at the photo and diagram of this creature invokes a sense of wonder - this is, after all, a distance relative living in the nearest aquarium with the shad.<br />This book is a delight to browse following one of the authors' intents.  Their second purpose, using this book as a reference, is even  more admirably met.  Clear photographs coupled with excellent diagrams, including typical environments of the selected specimens, add visual support to a readable text base.  Any reader interested in the way life is structured and seeking insights into evolutionary development would do well to consider this book.  It's not an academic text, but conveys a wealth of meaningful information.emember the name of this creature - &quot;it is the simplest of animals.&quot;  Composed of but a few thousand cells, it is a dull gray body just visible to the unaided eye.

Found in a gravel pit in 1912, the skullcap and jaw turned paleoanthropology into a ferocious battleground for many years.  Reputations were won and lost over interpreting the artefacts in the ensuing years.  Walsh carefully outlines the personalities and the sequence of events leading to the finds.  He describes how reluctantly many scholars accepted the original interpretations, until a \\"second Piltdown\\" overcame their misgivings.<br />Walsh's chapter \\"Challenging the Skull\\" is an excellent summation of the level of knowledge available at the time.  The key issue was the \\"ape-like\\" jaw adorned with a significant canine tooth, also found at the site.  Several scholars argued that such a tooth precluded the evidence of human chewing wear seen on the jaw's molars.  The second \\"find\\" swept away these contentions, although the chewing mechanism was never worked out.  Arthur Smith Woodward gave Piltdown the appellation Eoanthropus dawsonii honouring the finder of the skull.  It became the centre of British anthropological ideas for many years.<br />In 1953, however, fresh doubts arose concerning Piltdown.  Walsh leaps the intervening years abruptly to introduce Joseph Weiner.  Weiner, disturbed by the lack of supportive data and the results of new dating technology began to delve more deeply into establishing whether the jaw and skull were truly from one individual.  Close inspection revealed the tooth \\"wear\\" was the result of filing, not chewing!  After four decades, Piltdown was exposed as a fraud.<br />Walsh examines the cases against the primary figures involved in the find and the campaign to establish its primacy in the anthropological scene.  Charles Dawson, the original finder is first exonerated as being \\"too honest\\" for such an act.  Weiner, who originally investigated Dawson, couldn't obtain more than circumstantial evidence.  Walsh continues by recounting the several provoking assessments of other participants.  He finds the most compelling Stephen J. Gould's implication that the French priest, Teilhard de Chardin was the perpetrator.  Of all Gould's assaults on various scientific figures over the years, this one has always seemed the least plausible.  Walsh also finds it unconvincing, criticizing the use of evidence or its lack.  He critiques other accusations in the same way.  Yet, when he finally settles back on Dawson, his own case is built on surmise and supposition.  He is unable to actually demonstrate Dawson perpetrated the fraud.  Walsh's case is built on past events and some shady dealings on Dawson's part.  Of Piltdown, however, Walsh offers no solid evidence.  The most significant aspect of his case is his failure to provide motivation.  He builds a flimsy foundation of sibling rivalry, plausible, but unsubstantiated.<br />The glaring omission in this book is Walsh's failure to place Piltdown in its anthropological context.  While the deception circumstances and his survey of those accused of it make compelling reading, the real mystery is why such figures as Woodward and Keith clung to Piltdown's morphology in the face of contradictory evidence.  The real challenge to Piltdown came from South Africa with Raymond Dart's find of the Taung Child in 1924.  Taung's discovery refuted Piltdown's large brain capacity and the belief that modern humans evolved in Asia or Europe.  Woodward fought this analysis for years, vigorously defending his<br />\\"Earliest Englishman\\" against the African challenge.  Woodward's ideal early man must be British.  While Walsh's \\"detective story\\" makes compelling reading, his failure to provide in-depth motivation for anyone involved, even Dawson, still leaves too many questions unanswered.  Given the number of tarnished reputations the affair produced, this is an unfortunate lapse.  While Walsh has built a strong case, the jury remains unconvinced.ral provoking assessments of other participants.  He finds the most compelling Stephen J.

This book isn't &quot;a plant's-eye view of the world.&quot;  It could be better subtitled &quot;A Botanical Biography.&quot;  No matter.  This well-researched and wonderfully written group of essays examines the world of four mundane plants, the apple, tulip, hemp and potatoe.  Pollan describes how each have played major roles in human affairs.<br />In America, &quot;Johnny Appleseed&quot; is a giant figure in the mythology of the Ohio Valley.  Pollan describes the life of his real-life counterpart, John Chapman.  Apart from repeats of the Disney film of this character, it would be interesting to know how many remember the migratory apple orchardist of the early 19th Century today.  In reviving Chapman's memory [I'd never heard of him - there is no Canadian counterpart.], Pollan takes us on a well-developed history of this valuable fruit.  An emigrant from ancient Kazakhstan, it may have been brought to the West along the famous silk road, according to Pollan.  Along with the silk came the process of grafting, invented by the Chinese.  Pollan's reminds us that an apple's taste, which we usually consider a human reaction, was attractive to many animals, leading to its wide propagation.<br /><br />Pollan moves from fruit to flower.  The tulip, that quintessential symbol of the Netherlands, was the first flower to influence major economic activity.  He describes the frantic &quot;tulipomania&quot; that swept that country in the 17th Century.  Beautiful flowers are desired by most people, but to insects, Pollan notes, it means pollen and nectar.  Flowers need insects to ensure pollination - no insects, no more flowers.  Pollan suggests our own view of &quot;beauty&quot; derives from these evolutionary roots.<br />Pollan's choice of hemp, in its use as marijuana, will have raised a few eyebrows.  As a symbol of &quot;intoxication,&quot; he opens the essay with a description of plant toxins.  Toxins, Pollan reminds us, are capable of rendering the victim dead, or at least incapacitated.  Since plants and animals have a history of coevolution, deadly toxins are often counterproductive.  Besides, making them ties up much of the plant's resources.  Evolution led many plants to produce toxins that merely confuse or disable the predator.  Enter the human.  Plant chemistry is the basis of nearly all pharmaceuticals.  Pollan notes the properties of nicotine and caffeine on animals.  Marijuana's effects, as he notes, have a potential that goes beyond body chemistry.  His account of &quot;mary jane&quot; plants behind his barn is easily the most<br />entertaining episode in the book.<br />Returning to edible [for humans] plants, Pollan re-introduces us to the potato - often overlooked, but of immense value.  He views the potato as the ideal symbol for the rise of agriculture.  &quot;Agriculture is, by its very nature, brutally reductive, simplifying nature's incredibly complexity so something humanly manageable.&quot;  This simplification has made the crop potato susceptible to blights, as the Irish learned to their dismay.  Pollan, a consummate gardener, examines the possibilities of the Monsanto genetically-engineered NewLeaf potato.  It has its own insecticide locked in its DNA.  The experiment leads him to visit potato farmers for some enlightening exchanges of ideas and opinion.<br /><br />This book seizes your attention from the first pager.  Pollan's polished style and easy wit holds your interest throughout.  Whether you've ever gardened for fruits, vegetables or flowers, you will be captivated by these offerings.  It's a difficult book to put down, and taking it up again may offer missed rewards later.pable of rendering the victim dead, or at least incapacitated.

Jake has taken advantage of his life as a war-time correspondent to return to Berlin on dual assignments - one by a magazine to cover the Potsdam Conference, the other a self-imposed one to seek out a former lover.  His quests are impaired by Berlin's condition.  Security hampers the first and the city's devastation challenges the second.  He overcomes the obstacles to the first only to find the body of a murdered American soldier - a discovery made yet more mysterious by the amount of money the corpse was carrying.  Pursuing the story behind this killing leads Geismar through the rubble of Berlin - both physical and moral.  Berlin, former Nazi capital, shattered by bombs and shells, ruled by four invading nations, rife with black-markets, inhabited by people struggling to survive, is nearly a character in its own right.<br />The rendition of Geismar's story is presented in so compelling a manner that you feel every nuance of his frustrations and shocks.  Every character seems to offer issues you feel compelled to offer a personal response.  He confronts us with many of the fundamental questions.  What's right and what's wrong?  What is the true cost of survival under totalitarian regimes?  How much would you sacrifice for friends or neighbours?  Clearly, Kanon will accept no absolutes on these questions.  There are countless \\"gray areas\\" and just when you feel you can cope with the questions, \\"there's always something worse.\\"  You are an outsider in the Berlin of 1946, but tomorrow it could be where you are now.<br />The city's ruin is distressing to Jake as he hadn't seen the impact of \\"strategic bombing.\\"  The physical ruins, however, prove as nothing compared to the impact of Nazi policies on the populace.  Jake discovers Nazis where he least expects them.  Even worse, he learns an old friend was compelled to become a \\"greifer,\\" a Jew who identifies other Jews for the Gestapo.  Geismar is also confronted by the Allied wish to overlook the role of some Nazis in order to put them to use for scientific and commercial ends.  Kanon leaves no stone unturned in his ambition to paint a vivid and accurate picture of post-war Berlin.  He does a stunning job of it, without overwhelming the reader in irrelevant details.<br />Jake finds his abandoned lover, perhaps the only implausible event in the book.  It's a small matter, however, as Kanon flawlessly carries the reader along in his historical journey. Although the murder almost sinks from sight as Kanon develops his persona, it remains the key to many of Greismar's encounters.  The solution to the murder brings all the elements together.  Kanon does more than exhibit his abilities at historical research.  He delves into human feelings in ways few \\"mystery\\" novels can achieve.  As he leads Greismar through the tortured city he confronts new realities of life under the Nazis and Allied greed.  Right and wrong are increasingly blurred.

For anyone else it's a glimpse into outdated and strictly confined mind-set.  Thornton's subtitle is an unfulfilled promise.  We never really find out what \\"false knowledge\\" means - other than the catalogue of the author's dislikes.  Most of his attention is focussed on \\"revisionists\\" of one sort or another.  A  favourite target is academics who too easily disseminate \\"false knowledge.\\"  As a Classics professor, he has a strong background in social commentators through the ages.  Thornton calls up nearly all of them, starting with 17th Century critic Thomas Browne, in his attempt to disparage nearly every social issue from the environment through native peoples to women's issues.  It's a formidable arsenal, but of doubtful relevance in a modern environment.<br /><br />If you manage to plow through the opening chapter in which he establishes the superior values of the powers of Western knowledge, the remainder of the book is almost entertaining.  He places terms like \\"scientist\\" and \\"knowledge\\" in scare quotes, alerting you to his disdain.  Attributing many modern concepts to a holdover from the Romantic Era, Thornton finds critics of Western society as living self-indulgently in a mythical past.  The obscurity of his sources suggest it would take another classical scholar to assess how well he's cited them.  Their commonalty is their inappropriateness to bear witness on today's environment.<br /><br />Thornton notes how society has developed an \\"adversarial stance toward nature and a need to dominate and control its forces [although he exonerates Christianity for generating that attitude, blaming the small-farm society of ancient Greece instead].  The Romantic era regenerated a \\"nature-love,\\" on a false foundation carried forward to today's environmental movement.  He characterizes the \\"Deep Ecology movement,\\" for example, as a \\"farrago of old myths\\" rife with the \\"rhetoric of New Age narcissism.\\"  While he deplores the human impact on our world [particularly his home in California's San Joaquin Valley], Thornton falls well short of offering meaningful solutions.  His only cure for the pollution permeating his valley and the spread of urbanization is to call for \\"clear-headed discriminations between human needs and nature's\\" and to figure out \\"how we can rationally manage technology and growth.\\"  Hardly a novel idea, but Thornton fails to offer any specifics in fulfilling this ambition.  One can only wonder why Thornton has never read E. O. Wilson [there's no mention of America's leading environmentalist in the book].  It would have meant an major rewrite of several segments of this wearying tome.<br /><br />After environmentalists, Thornton addresses the \\"Noble Savage\\" image in Native American writing and films.  Later, it's the Goddess philosophy of Marija Gimbutas and her followers that he condemns.  Gimbutas' contention that the Golden Age of the Mother Goddess was peaceful and bound by a reverence for \\"Mother Earth\\" isn't substantiated by any evidence.  He shows how the mythical egalitarian societies envisioned by Gimbutas and her supporters is clearly unrealistic.  An organized hunting community is prone to hierarchies almost by definition.  To Thornton, the current widespread application of this \\"evidence by intuition\\" in university courses degrades scientific standards.<br /><br />Finally, he finds that \\"Multiculturism is perhaps the most dangerous false knowledge circulating among us.\\"  This section exposes the narrowness of Thornton's outlook.  While praising Western technology throughout the book, he is apparently ignorant of the Eastern contributions to that technology.  He castigates the hypocrisy of multiculturalism in its anti-Western manifestos, contending that the concepts of ethnic uniqueness are themselves a Western invention.  Multiculturism, in his view, erodes the foundation of Western ethics and morality, although we aren't provided with much in the way of definition of these terms.

The topic, of course, is &quot;I&quot;.  &quot;Who am I?  Can I explain my mind?  Can I formulate what happens in anyone's mind?&quot;  And, of course, the daunting question: &quot;can a computer become/have a mind?&quot;  With these troublesome queries in hand, Hofstadter and Dennett have collected a string of loosely connected essays to invigorate your thinking.  As the Preface states, the anthology &quot;is designed to provoke, disturb, and befuddle . . . readers.&quot;  If it fails, the readers certainly cannot blame the &quot;composers and arrangers,&quot; as the editors dub themselves.<br />Nothing in here is arcane or pedantic - there are no scholarly papers as such.  In fact, some of the 27 submissions are from the realm of &quot;SF&quot; [in the delightful definition of that term coined by writer Harlan Ellison - &quot;speculative fiction&quot;].  Among these offerings are essays by Jorge Luis Borge and Stanislaw Lem.  There are, of course, some philosophical statements.  Fortunately, none of these require knowledge of &quot;schools of philosophy.&quot;  All that is required to read this book is a desire to open your own mind and speculate on how you think.  And, perhaps, what you think.<br />A major virtue of this book are the &quot;Reflections&quot; following the essays.  In these Hofstadter or Dennett [or both] provide further insights on the author's offering.  The &quot;arrangers&quot; don't  enlarge on the article or &quot;interpret&quot; its meaning.  That's left to the reader.  The editors do, however, frequently pose further questions adding to the value of the selection.  There is little opportunity, except in a few cases, to critically assess the author's position.  With SF, a &quot;philosophical position&quot; is rare in any event.  Even so, the SF entries are not mere space adventures, but contributions to the idea of what makes a &quot;self,&quot; particularly in a society with high levels of technology.<br />Concepts of &quot;self&quot; as confronted with modern technology form a sub-theme of the collection.  The Turing Test provides a pivot point for many of the essays.  Can a computer achieve &quot;intelligence&quot; defined in a blind test of responses to questions?  Turing's original essay, &quot;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&quot; is offered early in the book, with a thorough examination of the issues raised in an imaginary dialog following.  Turing's thorny question is directly addressed in further essays and in the &quot;Reflections.  The editors make their own comments on this issue which, of course, is a foundation of developments in Artificial<br />Intelligence [AI].<br />Dennett, whose capacity for wit is finely honed, brings those skills to these pages.  His own essay on brain-body relations is a treasure for stimulating reflection.  Hofstadter contributes three essays of his own.  The real gem in this collection is Raymond Smullyan's &quot;Is God A Taoist?&quot;.  This dialog between a deity and a mortal on the issue of &quot;free will&quot; is outstanding - there is no other word that fits.  It is fundamental reading in examining the human thought process and the laws of nature.  The following Reflections by Hofstadter is rich with questions raised by Smullyan.  Hofstadter notes that many will consider the essay &quot;blasphemous,&quot; but that charge might be laid on the whole book.  That, of course, is what gives it much appeal.  While the open-minded will benefit most from this collection,  you need only to leave your mind slightly ajar to enjoy what the &quot;composers&quot; have offered you.ty with high levels of technology.<br />Concepts of &quot;self&quot; as confronted with modern technology form a sub-theme of the collection.

This book presents the results of her search in a thought-provoking and thoroughly researched account.  Her focus is the Kennewick Man - an ancient skeleton found on the banks of the Columbia River.  Kennewick Man became the centre of storms of political, anthropological and racial controversy.  Native Americans sought the remains for burial under the provisions of  the Native Americans Graves Protection and Repatriation Act [NAGPRA], while the anthropologists sought to date and establish their historical origins.  An announcement that the skull appeared \\"Caucasoid\\" fanned the flames of racism among scientists and politicians alike.  What, precisely, constitutes \\"Caucasoid\\" features in a skull, ancient or modern?  In answering that question, and others it raises, Dewar expanded her quest for information, visiting scholars and leading her into a maelstrom of debate.<br />The \\"Caucasoid\\" contention raised the issue of the validity of consensus theories about the origins of Native Americans.  Anthropologists have long contended that Native Americans are migrants from Eastern Asia.  The time frame suggests their migration would have to have taken place during the time the Laurentian Ice Sheet left a narrow corridor in Western Canada allowing these invaders to journey south into North America.  As Dewar notes, this idea gave early anthropologists a handle for ranking \\"natives\\" as inferior to later European invaders.  The tenuous grounds for this assertion are thoroughly explained in this book.  However, the idea persisted as part of the \\"out of Africa\\" theory of prehistoric human migration used to refute the \\"multi-regional\\" evolution of humanity.  Dewar attempts to balance the evidence of artifact and skeletal evidence age, with what is known about the environment in times past.<br />Timing in resolving those two theses is the critical factor, as Dewar shows.  Standard thinking on humanity's evolution means Homo sapiens must have arrived here about 12 000 years ago.  She explains the importance of the \\"Clovis Culture\\" artifacts supporting this date.  She then introduces the hitch in the timing issue caused by the discovery of the Monte Verde site in Chile.  This site suggests human occupation far down the South American coast as long ago as 35 000 years.  Dewar also spoke with Brazilian sources, who claim finding evidence of human occupation there up to 30 000 years ago.  She follows the claims back and forth among those who support and those rejecting the dating trying to determine who is likely to have a final answer.<br />One can only sympathize with Dewar's clearing articulated frustrations.  She strives to find the balance point among the many contending claims.  Untrained as an anthropologist, molecular geneticist or even lawyer, she makes an outstanding effort to present the evidence given her and try to evaluate it for us.  The process is doubly complicated by the personalities of those she must deal with.  There are the prima-donnas, the narrowly focused academics, the open-minded field researchers all presenting her with opinions, evidence, history.  Much evidence seems good, other assertions poorly substantiated.  As she complains, the quest eroded many of her own long-held views.  \\"I left behind the awe I once felt for the authority of scientists.\\"  Reading this book will leave you sympathetic to her plaint.  The shortcomings of this book are rarely hers, and you will find yourself fully drawn in to her desire to achieve justice in ethnic strife and scientific endeavour.  It's a masterful attempt, reflecting our own prejudices and misconceptions.  She's to be commended for her persistence and the clarity of her presentation.dard thinking on humanity's evolution means Homo sapiens must have arrived here about 12 000 years ago.

According to Turner, part of this obscurity is due to Shepard's radical views and his work being &quot;formidably intellectual.&quot;  Perhaps another part is Shepard's assault on humanity's domestication of various animals.  Few admire a man who kicks the family dog.  &quot;On Animal Friends&quot; is a deeply thought out treatise on the history and<br />full genetic and philosophical implications of what domestication has done to humans and other animals alike.<br />Shepard is a challenging read.  Not for problems of clarity - his prose flows easily under the reader's eyes.  His ideas, however, chain your attention.  You are brought to a halt as what he argues forces reflection on many novel ideas.  A major figure in ecological studies for many years, these wide-ranging essays address a variety of topics.  The underlying theme is humanity's Pleistocene roots.  How far, Shepard asks, have history and evolution actually brought us?  What forces have we applied to separate ourselves from the rest of Nature?  What traditions do we hold dear and how many of these should we consider modifying or abandoning as we efface our environment?  These questions have been asked before, but Shepard poses them in fresh contexts and offers challenging answers.<br />Although among America's leading environmentalists, he kept himself apart from &quot;mainstream&quot; thinking typifying the movement.  These essays demonstrate a far broader outlook than espoused by many of his colleagues.  Here, he addresses esthetics, theoretical psychology and the virtues of hunting.  His views are unexpected and his handling of the topics flawless.  He criticizes his fellows without hesitation - in one case calling Paul Martin's idea that the extinction of large fauna was caused by Pleistocene humans &quot;preposterous.&quot;<br />You will come away from this book unsettled.  That is how it should be and precisely what Shepard intended.  You will not, however, close this book unsatisfied.

Recognizing that bands of rock repeated their patterns across central England, he found he could forecast the location of likely mineral deposits.  Winchester traces the course of Smith's career with easy style and immense feeling.  This is no scholarly, pedantic exercise [although Winchester clearly has done his research], the author's too sympathetic with his subject for that.  His empathy with Smith permeates nearly every page.  The feelings are enhanced by the ammonite illustrations heading each chapter.  One almost<br />regrets the publisher not giving them more space.<br />Graphics space aside, Winchester's descriptive abilities imparts this tale of a man's troubled life at the beginning of the 19th Century with sincerity.  Keeping the great map that resulted from Smith's work before us throughout the book, Winchester brings all the threads together with graceful ease.  Smith wandered the British countryside, collecting fossils, data, building a picture of what lay under the surface soil.  He linked outcrops, canal cuts through hills, assembled samples and studied patterns.  The result, as Winchester urges, \\"changed the world.\\"  The  map led to a more vivid image of the Earth's formation and geologic activity, setting the stage for Lyell and Darwin.  That rocks displayed patterns was the basis for the concept of change over time - the earth wasn't static.  There was a discernible continuity over the millennia.  Smith, of course, had no concept of the span of time involved, as Winchester reminds us, but without the schema Smith developed, we might yet still see the Earth as static.<br />Winchester avoids background description of Smith's era.  This keeps this book within a reasonable size, but leaves Smith's working world a bit vague.  It was, after all, the era of the Napoleonic wars.  England was in social and political ferment.  Natural science was burgeoning for numerous reasons, not the least of which was a strong rise in commercial and industrial endeavor.  Smith's wife is characterized as a nymphomaniac, but the evidence for this is scanty.  If her condition was publicly known it would have had strong impact on Smith's professional life.  Was Smith's heavy debt load due as much to her as to his<br />inadvisable property investments?  Winchester was unable to unearth the fiscal details of Smith's life.  It's enough that between fiscal and marital problems, Winchester shows how the morals of the era allowed Smith's work to be plagiarized without recourse.  The combination of events finally led him into exile in Northern England.  Although belated, Smith's story has a reasonably happy conclusion.  Winchester traces the redemption of Smith's reputation and the honours bestowed near the end of his life.<br /> The book is a stimulating read.  Winchester isn't an arm-chair writer.  He takes us along on his own journey across Britain, tracing Smith's path over the landscape.  The book is, in effect, a second redemption of Smith, bringing him into the view of the modern world.  Winchester shows us clearly how much work is involved in doing good science, especially with limited resources, erratic backing and an uncomprehending public.

1490603:US	50941451	RWSPAW4QLG8XM	026268117X	450852878	Dennett's Philosophy: A Comprehensive Assessment	Books	5	25	25	N	N	A Stance for flexibility	Daniel Dennett has become the pivot point for all modern ideas in human cognition - philosophy's successor term.  Unlike the classical philosophers, Dennett adheres to no &quot;school&quot; of philosophy.  Indeed, one of the editors of this book attempts to coin the phrase &quot;Dennettian&quot; to establish a new such identity - an effort Dennett himself simply ignores.  Dennett's many writings do not lend themselves to any rigid classification.  Pinning him down is attempting to transfix the ultimate moving target.  Dennett's tactics have led to criticism ranging from mild admonitions to scathing invective.  This group of essays, resulting from a 1998 conference at Memorial University in Newfoundland, is a collection of advice, critique and demands for explanation from this innovative thinker .  The book's tone is<br />perfectly captured in Dennett's response essay, &quot;With A Little Help From My Friends.&quot;  It is pure &quot;Dennettian.&quot;<br />Don Ross' Introduction expresses the frustration many have felt about Dennett's writings:  &quot;Do Dennett's works `come together' into a coherent view of the world?&quot;  The answer to that question must be sought in the essays as each author struggles to address it through various elements found in Dennett's writings.  The first part takes up his views on evolution.  This is right and proper, since his &quot;Darwin's Dangerous Idea&quot; [DDI] is easily the most important book published since Darwin's &quot;Origin of Species.&quot;  Timothy Crowe challenges various aspects of Dennett's view of how evolution works, falling, quite consciously, into Stephen Gould's assertions about &quot;maladaptations.&quot;  Paul Dumouchel's following essay on Dennett's use of Forced Moves and Good Tricks in DDI shows how a critic must demonstrate understanding before offering appraisal.<br />Following these openings, the essays move into a more &quot;philosophical&quot; vein.  [Dennett would argue those &quot;scare quotes&quot; would deter some or mislead others!]  Ruth Millikan, adhering to Dennett's stand that cognition is a human extension of the evolutionary processes, suggests modification to a fundamental of Dennett's thinking - the Intentional Stance.  She wants better identification of &quot;intentionality&quot; of natural selection.  Her unease is echoed in Tom Polger's essay on the use of &quot;conceptual fictions&quot; such as &quot;zombies,&quot; artificial biological beings with no discernible intentionality, a concept Dennett has repeatedly rejected.<br />Other essays in this collection further attempt to fix Dennett's ideas within some identifiable framework.  Christopher Viger, Timothy Kenyon and William Seager, particularly the latter, all seek Dennett's abandonment of a &quot;purely naturalistic rule&quot; for his thinking.  These admonitions Dennett dismisses as a misunderstanding of how nature works.  Flexibility is the key, and is Dennett's lodestone.  Among the remaining essays, Andrew Brook's symbolizes the dichotomy faced by Dennett adherents: how to fix on that elusive object without eroding its valuable contents.  Brook reminds us that Dennett has spent thirty years giving us an account of consciousness.  In that time, Dennett has challenged long-standing concepts in philosophy.  Brook implores Dennett to clarify several of his definitions, in particular the distinction between the &quot;seeming&quot; of an object and the actual &quot;subject&quot; under discussion.  How do we distinguish between a thing and our idea of that thing?  Brook disclaims any attempt to bring down Dennett's Multiple Drafts model of consciousness, but feels he has  &quot;domesticated it a bit.&quot;  Reader unfamiliar with the Multiple Drafts model are urged to take up Dennett's &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot; for the most innovative idea of the mind's workings currently available.<br />Space limitations forbid a thorough recapitulation of all the essays.  It goes without saying thatDennett directly addresses each essayist's points [where these are discernible, which isn't always the case].  He acknowledges where clarity in his work is required, but often finds the interpreter has missed his meaning.  In philosophical writing, that is often a given.  With most explanations of human reasoning being labelled with various &quot;-isms,&quot; Dennett stresses his discomfort with such constraints.  He's to be admired for resisting such limitations, and reading his responses, we are reminded again of why the conference was convened.  Dennett is more than a square peg resisting a round hole.  He's polygonal, reflecting the scope of his diversity of interests and abilities.  He stands apart from &quot;mainstream&quot; concepts, remaining unique as the leading figure in cognitive studies.t Dennett directly addresses each essayist's points [where these are discernible, which isn't always the case].

Tasmania's special place in history and geography is depicted in the special style that can only be invoked by the self-exile.  His prose is rich with metaphor in dealing with his own life, Tasmania's physical features and the society English society imposed on it.  Raised in a suburb north of the State Capital, Hobart [the world's most southern such], Conrad's childhood environment was overshadowed by the looming, capriciously moody Mount Wellington.  Everything else about Tasmania was \\"Behind the Mountain.\\"<br />Conrad is expressive about what it was like to be raised in a place that even the rest of Australia seemed to have forgotten - it was left off school maps of the Last Continent.  As the site of imprisonment for the most incorrigible of Britain's transported felons, its white inhabitants later tried to erase their own history.  Isolated, then, in place both globally and socially, its people clung to the only culture they could derive - the \\"home\\" that was England.  Even when the rest of Australia sought ties with the Americans, Tasmania remained locked into their version of the \\"old country.\\"<br />Conrad breaks the mould of that image.  He's frank about the white's treatment of Tasmania's Aborigine population and culture.  He contrasts the outlook that named and respected every mountain, stream or other physical feature of the island.  The Parlemar people were rounded up in a series of paramilitary exercises, the most notorious that of the Black Line.  The surviving Aborigines [some suicided from seaside cliffs] were exiled to Flinders Island and other off-shore sites to rot and die.  Even their corpses were desecrated by amateur \\"anthropologists\\" keen to depict them as sub-humans, well deserving extinction.  The eradication was absolute - Tasmania remains the only Australian State with no surviving indigenous population.<br />Conrad journeys over the island by bus and aircraft [he is unable to drive].  The jaunts confront us with bizarre naming practices the island was subjected to by white settlers.  No Aborigine names were applied until the State's Hydro Commission attempted some restitution while building dams in the mountains.  The attempt is simply a final instance of the paucity of knowledge of Aborigine culture.  His tours take us to Port Davey, a week's walk from the nearest road end, and the distant, disreputable Macquarie Harbour.  His map shows the anomaly of this extensive estuary with its entrance but 60 metres wide.  It was truly the end of the world for many convicts who laboured their lives away under assault by winds originating off the South African coast.<br />His candor in descriptions of his life and his family is refreshing.  He aspired to the exile he entered with unwarranted enthusiasm.  The book opens with the conflagration of his childhood artifacts.  He is later as disturbed by this sacrifice as we are while reading it.  His evocative metaphors evoke the remorse to follow him as he recovers or recreates those childhood losses.  The memories he solicits show a level of  confusion about his own identity - at one point unable to discern whether the image in a photograph is himself or his father.  Life on the Apple Isle could lead to such vague self-persona given the paucity of information about his roots.  An alcoholic grandfather had simply been made to disappear by the rest of his family.<br />It's trite to state that any examination of one's roots can lead to disillusionment.  But Conrad's return to this remote land provided an improved sense of self-identity.  He returned to learn more of his natal surroundings than would have been possible had he not left.  He demonstrates that all he learned during his journeys didn't require a comparison to his adopted land to be valuable.  Every place he visited or researched provided new elements of his self-awareness in their own right.  The book is an object lesson for anyone who has left home for other venues.  Read it to learn of this faraway land, the brilliance of its re-discoverer, and perhaps some insight into your own outlook about where you are.  It's a rewarding journey.object lesson for anyone who has left home for other venues.

1490754:US	50941451	R3WH7KV9VW6FF	0300054319	502128286	Narratives of Human Evolution	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Merging of science and humanities	Landau's book is a breakthrough in the studies of early humanity.  Most researchers, particularly field workers, naturally assumed they were simply finding, indexing and describing bones and artifacts.  Landau's innovative ideas illustrate that once the &quot;museum pieces&quot; are listed and described, the urge to place them in a greater context is inescapable.  We are too concerned with our origins to permit our origins to be relegated to a museum<br />directory.  In order to explain and understand our ancestors, we fall back on the narrative format to explain our origins.  Since our most familiar narrative experience is the &quot;folk myth,&quot; with its frank order of events, explaining our past tends to use this easily understood framework.  While she applies this formula to paleoanthropology, she argues that it fits well in the physical sciences also.  Whether physical sciences or human evolution, the narrative format is given as much weight as the physical evidence.<br />She uses a classic analysis, Valdimir Propp's 1928 work Morphology of the Folktale as her reference point.  Propp used &quot;functions&quot; in describing the elements of a story, beginning with the hero setting on a quest, accepting a &quot;donor's&quot; help and undergoing tests until &quot;arriving at a higher state&quot; at the conclusion.  Given that Propp offered 31 different functions that could be applied, there's much room for flexibility in applying the story equation in various sciences.  For paleoanthropology, Landau selects nine of Propp's elements in portraying how various theorists used a similar format in describing the path of human evolution.<br />Although Landau opens the book with the views of Thomas Henry Huxley and Ernst Haekel, the significant protagonists are the British and American thinkers, Keith, Wood, Elliot Smith, Osborn and Gregory.  The central issue was whether humans became bipedal before developing large brains, or the reverse.  Elliot Smith stood almost alone in viewing intelligence preceding upright walking.  She provides us with a diagram summarizing these theorists before examining their individual views in the text.<br />Landau finds use of the narrative formula as a liberating mechanism in studying our past.  Those paleoanthropologists who resist adopting this technique are unnecessarily restraining themselves, she argues.  Attempts by the &quot;post-modernists&quot; and &quot;deconstructionists&quot; to subvert the established narrative structure are unlikely to succeed, particularly where it is utilized in the sciences.  She offers the &quot;biography&quot; of a subatomic particle to demonstrate how pervasive the narrative form is within scientific literature.  In one sense, Landau may have provided a major step in the unity of science and humanity so earnestly sanctioned by Edward O. Wilson in his &quot;Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge.

The irony of that image is they underlying theme of this exquisite historial novel.  Tasmania is hardly \\"westernmost\\" to anywhere.  It is the southernmost State in Australia and the ranks of heroes are depressingly thin.  Edric has reached back in time to examine the realities of this \\"paradise.\\"  He accomplishes this brief history with consummate depth of feeling.  His portrayal is a vivid account of real events, imbued with attitudes unshed even in our \\"modern\\" world.  All of this is accomplished through the eyes of one man, a member of a lost society.<br />William Lann&eacute; was the last full-blooded male Tasmanian Aborigine.  Living on edge of Hobart, he is known by all, from the Governor to the common soldier.  He dresses in military finery or simple rags.  He is the subject of one of England's many amateur anthropologists that pervaded England's colonies during the 19th century.  Specially selected by James Fairfax as a \\"representative\\" of the Aborigine race, Lann&eacute; is to be measured against a diagram Fairfax has prepared for him.  This indignity was imposed on many \\"natives\\" within the British Empire's colonies.  They were frequently subjected to various metrological assessments in order to justify the occupation of their homeland by the white invaders.  If their physiognomy could be demonstrated as \\"inferior\\" to the European ideal, then colonization could successfully be excused as \\"uplifting savages.\\"<br />Edric does a fine job of portraying both the colonizer's outlook and the Aborigines' reaction to it.  Fairfax is prompt in assuring \\"King Billy\\" that his person is safe - the measuring process will be painless.  He won't lose any limbs or be cut into.  Edric, amazingly, omits the irony that after Lann&eacute;'s death, that was precisely the fate his corpse was subjected to.  Edric makes up for this historical appendix by giving Lanne a dream foretelling the fate his remains would suffer.  This technique suggests Edric targeted this book for an audience with some familiarity with Australian colonial events.<br />Edric captures the enduring conflict between the colonizers and those they exterminated.  Lann&eacute; is subject to open racial insults from locals and more subtle ones from Fairfax, who strips him for measurement, something he could never ask of Stalker, a white soldier.  Edric portrays Lann&eacute; as highly articulate and thoughtful - in stark contrast to the soldiers.  Fairfax queries Lann&eacute; about the Black Line which was designed to sweep up the Aborigine population and exile them from Tasmania.  Not all were taken, of course, and others had already been \\"domesticated\\" leaving a population of half-breeds among the island's population.  Lann&eacute;  is confronted by a band of these who roam the bush.  Although they enjoy greater freedom than Lann&eacute; does, like all peoples colonized by Europeans, the sins of one bring vengence on the many - often just the nearest.  \\"Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Justice served!,\\" is the white community's watchword.  Edric portrays Bonaparte, a long time mate of Lanne's as an elusive, but dedicated figure.  He challenges Lanne to return to his roots.  Lanne's moral captivity by the white world is strong and the desire to readapt to his origins is threaded with doubt.  His response to Fairfax's illness is symptomatic of the dual existence he endures.<br />Edric's story is told with compelling language and deep insight into Aborigine thinking.  This work will stand for some time as a high quality example of the roots of racial ideas in white society.  It portrays beautifully the mental conflicts colonial peoples must carry as part of their baggage in today's world.  We of that world need to gain the understanding Edric's fine work offers us.

Set in the tobacco growing region of Appalachia, she uses the four women and a retired geneticist to discuss evolution, predator-prey relationships and modern farming practices to foster realistic thinking about environmental issues.  These run from \\"pest elimination\\" to herbicide use.  She deftly relates the different sex ploys of moths, coyotes and humans.  The result leaves the human patterns more inexplicable than ever.  The middle-aged<br />Deanna encounters a man in the bush, and we never quite discern which of the pair is the seducer.  Lexington Lusa loses a husband, but gains an  adolescent.  And a septuagenarian, to his everlasting shame, gets an erection over his neighbour, who is nearly as ancient as he.<br />It's unclear what the target market is for this book.  Clearly, it isn't her former neighbours in Appalachia.  Kingsolver's patronizing attitude toward the farm country patois is almost embarrassing.  \\"Political correctness\\" hasn't reached down to regional speech patterns yet, apparently.  Those tobacco farmers are unlikely to buy into her attempt to explain evolution and it's unlikely she's going to hamper coyote hunting there or anywhere else.  The urban readers who have already learned about Darwin will buy this book out of loyalty.  Will they learn anything new?  Perhaps, but if they wander the countryside trying to sell Kingsolver's ideas as she does, their reception is likely to be a warm one.<br />Will her buyers pick up this book for its plot?  Hopefully not, for their disappointment will be severe.  As each character is introduced within their environment, the resulting events are glaringly predictable.  Deanna's sexual perplexity conflicts with her newly acquired environmental outlook.  What prompted her to write a thesis on coyotes remains an enigma.  Lusa, a transplanted farm wife from the city, MUST somehow end up with the farm, making a go of it in novel fashion.  It seems to be a genetic trait, but again, the causes remain vague.  The crusty old man, Garnett Walker III, is the most predictable of all, and the cruelest.  Kingsolver gives us a shambling clown, self-contained, irascible due to his infirmities and in constant contention with the world.  Kingsolver may find cataracts, memory loss and dizzy spells humorous, but it will be interesting to see her outlook if these afflictions strike her at that age.<br />Her persistence in portraying all men as inadequate in one way or another has grown more than a little shopworn.  Opening one of her books leads you inevitably into a mob of resourceful, enterprising women, all successful somehow even in the face of adversity.  That adversity is always men - even when the failing is simply dying at \\"the wrong time.\\"  Walker is derived from the father in Poisonwood Bible, an over-Christianized geriatric who finds it difficult, strangely enough, to shed nearly eight decades of his upbringing.  His \\"redemption\\" makes compelling narrative, but the genders could have been reversed without losing the impact.  A young man is told to shove off, but, of course, only does so after his partner becomes pregnant.  Formula stuff.<br />Kingsolver's descriptive powers will entice her legions of fans to this book.  The city element among them will nod sympathetically.  Rural readers, even outside Appalachia, may be confronted with some unpalatable truths, but it's unlikely their views will be modified by this novel.  It's a good beach read for those who want to relax and escape, but there's nothing serious to reflect on here.  Such concepts are better sought elsewhere.farm, making a go of it in novel fashion.

He has demonstrated his leading role in many works, but none reached the heights this book achieves.  While his challenging 1975 work &quot;Sociobiology&quot; resulted in a storm of controversy, few books [excepting Darwin's Origin] have spurred more scientific effort.  Wilson's autobiography, &quot;Naturalist&quot; conveyed how far-reaching his thinking can go.  &quot;Consilience&quot; extends that reach beyond his own discipline of biology to encompass all the social sciences and into the arts and religion [but not theology!].  As with any work of his, this book exhibits his crisp narrative style.  Wilson has an outstanding ability to cover the leading topics in science in combination with the humanities.<br />Unlike many of his noisy critics, Wilson is unwilling to exclude humanity from the forces of Darwinian evolution.  Consilience seeks to expand thinking about evolution's impact on the entire human condition.  He harks back to the ideas of the Enlightenment, particularly those of Condorcet, who he equates with Jefferson, in taking the broadest view of the world and the place of humanity within it.  From here, Wilsion expounds on the process of science and how it has been validated.  Even with its triumphs, science has not displaced the humanities, nor, in Wilson's view, should it.  Various pressures separated the natural sciences and philosophy after the Enlightenment.  In today's world, the breach has been widened by the &quot;post-modernists&quot; who flatly deny any universal aspect of human behaviour.  Wilson is particularly harsh on the &quot;deconstruction&quot; movement of recent years.  It must be noted here that any natural scientist who has read Derrida and comprehends him  is worth rallying to and following.  Wilson's call rejects post-modernism and urges a bridging of the abyss separating the natural sciences and the humanities.<br />Wilson's Bridge is constructed of known materials established in a new way.  Rebutting the false critics who label him a &quot;genetic determinist,&quot; Wilson calls for a new study field of &quot;gene-culture coevolution,&quot; in which he sees culture created by a &quot;communal mind made up of individual minds which are the product of the genetically structured human brain.&quot;  The genetic structure permits flexible interaction with the other minds of the community, making the culture evolve along with the individuals.  Once this concept is accepted within both the humanities and scientific disciplines, consilience will be successfully launched.<br />The arts and religions are not excepted from this programme.  Wilson urges those in the arts to seek out the evolutionary roots of artistic expression and find new insights for artistic expression.  Wilson eschews the organized religions as the final arbiters of ethics.  Centuries of debate boil down to a duality: &quot;Either ethical precepts  . . . are independent of human experience or else they are human inventions.&quot;  He further contends that empirical reasoning should look to his gene-culture coevolution concept to better understand what truly underlies ethical precepts.  He sees &quot;the current expansion of scientific inquiry into the deeper processes of human thought [will make] this venture feasible.&quot;  It's an inquiry we should all follow with interest.is constructed of known materials established in a new way.

They snarl defiance, snap at perceived weak spots, duck and weave in clear frustration.  In the end [literally, in this volume] the monarch's strengths prevail as he disposes of his tormentors one by one in a series of deft swipes.  Dahlbom has done us a service with this volume in exhibiting why Dennett is one of today's foremost thinkers.  He shows that so many express their envy of Dennett's abilities with their own self-enhancement.<br />Dennett has several aspects working for him, beyond just clarity of thinking.  Uncommon in a philosopher, Dennett subscribes to no \\"school\\" of thought.  While several of these essays attempt to confine him in a niche, he's far too flexible to be pigeon-holed.  That flexibility is a source of frustration for these critics in many respects.  Never rigid in his thinking, Dennett accepts criticism where it's warranted.  But the critic must be conversant with the latest developments in many fields, not just philosophy.  Dennett's root strength is his reliance on all science for his concepts.  He's conversant with evolutionary biology, computer science and other relevant fields.  While this gives him a significant edge in cognitive studies, his presentation of evidence leads critics such as those in this collection to label him arrogant.  This \\"arrogance\\" is simply due to his being right far more than he is wrong.<br />While available space prohibits a thorough review of these essays, a few noteworthy items should be identified.  Colin McGinn stresses the need for \\"logical laws\\" of psychology.  He finds the brain's operation must be innately equipped to use logic in order to function at all.  While these \\"laws\\" are yet to be fully derived, McGinn argues that as rational beings, humans must operate within a mathematically logical framework.  He accepts Dennett's three-level structure of \\"physical stance, design stance and intentional stance,\\" but insists a fourth level, a \\"logical stance\\" must be added in order to properly establish the basis of human reasoning.  This view counters Dennett's long-held view that \\"laws\\" of philosophy are misplaced.  He contends that the brain \\"uses\\" logic, but doesn't have logic \\"built in.\\"<br />The essay by Jerry Fodor and Ernest Lapore reflects the attitude that Principles precede supportive arguments.  They challenge Dennett's use of the \\"intentional stance\\" as a biological feature in natural selection.  They want him to fit his ideas about evolution of cognitive abilities into a set of well-defined \\"central principles.\\"  In order to clarify their intent, they define various \\"schools\\" of interpretation with an implied challenge to Dennett to adhere to one of them.  Dennett naturally finds this invitation counter to his expressed methods, suggesting that Fodor and Lapore have \\"drawn and quartered\\" philosophy.<br /><br />Kathleen Akins demonstrates the impact of three years' studying under Dennett's tutelage.  Her essay responds to the famous Thomas Nagle essay, \\"What is it like to be a bat?\\"  Her rejoinder is a well presented and thoughtful depiction of how bats perceive the world.  Superficially, this appears meaningless to the human viewpoint.  Akins' realistic picture of the bat's world [which Nagel failed to achieve], however, provides an improved foundation for establishing a valid depiction of the human outlook on the world.<br />Dennett's response to these essays demonstates the dangers in attempting to \\"shoehorn\\" him into one or another of the \\"schools\\" of philosophy.  He is more concerned with deriving good ideas, whether his own or that of others.  Once found, he wants to share them with others and inspire yet more suggestions.  If the ideas fail to fit into an existing niche, so much the worse for the niche.  He does philosophy in the most practical manner possible - \\"in an engineering spirit\\" - as he puts it.  As with any engineer, he is cautious about accepting what appears to be a good idea until it can be fully tested.  He resists Richard Rorty's call for him to be \\"more ambitious,  more radical and more glamorous.\\"  Dennett's stance is based on scientific principles - evidence, not glamour, is the quest.ut accepting what appears to be a good idea until it can be fully tested.

Kinder's account of the bizarre Tommy Thompson's quest to locate a 19th Century shipwreck is a delightful rags to riches story.  Kinder weaves historical and contemporary events together seamlessly.  He takes us back and forth in time, showing how a clear modern knowledge of each stage of the shipwreck led to the S.S. Central America's location at the bottom of the Atlantic.<br />Kinder is adept at the difficult task of maintaining two story lines in one book.  The loss of the Central America is clearly a fascinating story in its own right.  Its cargo, millions of dollars worth of gold bullion would have had significant impact on the nascent American economy.  Kinder has performed a major feat in tracking the course of the journey and presenting the passenger accounts of the storm and sinking.  He shows us the terror, the struggles to preserve the ship and the attempts by other vessels to rescue the survivors.  His descriptive powers are excellent - the reader is kept enthralled as the tragedy unfolds.<br />Thompson's career is just as finely detailed as the historical account.  Kinder shows us the workings of a firmly focussed mind.  Thompson has the capacity to irritate and captivate those he deals with, whether on technical or economic levels.  Clearly, he is infectious when presenting ideas or encouraging his followers.  The results were almost foreordained that he would succeed in locating the wreck.<br />The finding, however, was anything but inevitable.  Finding any sunken vessel at such depths, let alone the correct one, Kinder shows is a nearly insurmountable problem.  Yet, in his account, success is achieved.  It took ingenuity, persistence and insight, with some help from technology.  Deep sea exploration devices, while not exactly in their infancy at this time, had serious limitations.  Kinder recounts many of the issues Thompson and his team faced, but is reticent about their solutions.  He presumably laboured under some form of non-disclosure agreement with Thompson.  Even without explicit details, Thompson's ingenuity and persistence is clearly manifest.  Kinder portrays him in the clearest possible light just as he illuminates the history of the Central America.

This American philosopher's ability to pose thought-provoking questions is unmatched.  In this collection, the focus is on &quot;what is a mind?&quot;  How do we define &quot;the mind&quot; and are humans the sole possessors of it?  Dennett is not only deft at posing these posers, he presents the questions and his explanations with philosophy's finest prose and wit.  His other advantage over his fellow cognitive scientists is his use of Darwin's &quot;dangerous idea,&quot; evolution by natural selection.  As products of that process, humans are not exempt from its rules.  That framework raises the issue of whether other creatures can be said to have &quot;minds.&quot;  Dennett explores this issue with skillfully chosen examples.  These are part of the list of &quot;kinds of minds.&quot;<br />Dennett is famous among philosophers for devising the concept of &quot;the intentional stance.&quot;  The intentional stance is interpreting the behaviour of an entity.&quot;  The range of entities is extensive - a simple thermostat has predictable behaviour - when the room is cool, the device closes a circuit turning on the heat.  According to Dennett, the simplest creatures exhibited similar &quot;robotic&quot; behaviour, but as life evolved, more complex patterns developed.  Dennett argues that &quot;adopting the intentional stance is not just a good idea but the key to unraveling the mysteries of the mind - all kinds of minds.&quot;  In his view, intentional systems have progressed along the course of evolution in ever complex steps.  Humans, with the development of language, have achieved the highest level of cognitive abilities.<br />Dennett addresses what many philosophers call the &quot;mind-body&quot; question.  Those who feel the mind and body must be considered separately will face some challenging assertions here.  Perhaps more importantly, those who may not feel disposed to read philosophy, will find much stimulate thinking about who they really are.  Dennett keeps his presentation clearly formulated and easily readable.  Quick, simple answers to questions about thinking are not Dennett's style.  This is a slim tome, but the few pages are packed with rigorously conceived concepts.  The words flow easily, but the content will bear repeated readings.  As Dennett reminds us, there are countless questions about what a mind is, with many answers remaining to be derived.

He begins by noting the problem of describing the evolution of human intelligence from fossil remains.  Thoughts don't leave fossils, but many &quot;popular&quot; accounts of human evolution are full of speculations about the development of human cognition.  The stories presented, according to Byrne, are frequently contradictory.  What is the careful reader able to believe?  Byrne accepts the necessity of competing speculations.  After all, &quot;detective work is fun.&quot;  Byrne stresses that there are answers available.  The evidence comes from the behaviour of other animals.<br />He begins with a lesson in taxonomy, those bushy diagrams relating the place of humans with our fellow creatures.  He argues that every animal is born with innate behavioural traits - there are no &quot;blank slates&quot; on which cognition must be built.  As Byrne puts it: &quot;Genetically channeled learning is evidently a powerful and efficient tool for giving animals what they need to survive.&quot;  As animals hone derived skills and develop new ones, new levels of cognition arise.  If these can be passed on, the result is higher levels of intelligence.  Limited only by how much a species can carry over to new generations, the process is recursive.<br />Byrne examines many levels of learning, particularly food seeking and memory in both field and laboratory.  His description of monkeys seeking ways of obtaining food from a plastic tube make one wonder how long a monkey would persist in probing for hard-to-reach food in the wild.  Surely, the frustrations the monkeys were forced to endure would rarely occur in the wild.  A hungry monkey would simply move on to another site.  Their skills in the wild are impressive enough.  Byrne describes many species, particularly chimpanzees and orang-utans learning the seasonal locations of many plant foods and applying the most energy efficient routes to obtain it.  He stresses that &quot;Learning mechanisms are best regarded as devices for ensuring that animals learn adaptive information.&quot;  All these studies lead, of course, that humans are driven by the same genetic forces as our fellow creatures.<br />Byrne reviews the many studies done with various monkey and ape species.  There are few consistent patterns among them.  Some monkeys attain high social and cognitive skills for particular environments.  Some species attain surprising levels of reception, adaptation in dealing with available food, reaction to predators, interactions with their fellows.  From these studies in both the field and laboratory, he argues that &quot;in a limited way, great apes can think.&quot;<br />Many studies in the evolution of human cognition stress our use of symbols as the foundation of language skills.  Byrne argues that many apes have learned symbols, but notes that this skill is limited to practical applications.  They can apply symbols to seek things which are then immediately put to use.  The limitation in these linguistic abilities is &quot;grammar.&quot;  Byrne's discussion of ape &quot;language&quot; and &quot;grammar&quot; is comprehensive and thorough.  Most significant, according to Byrne, is the different levels of language skill achieved by various individual apes.  The lack of uniform patterns in language use indicates no universal rules should be applied to ape learning.  The ability is there, but varies from one ape to another.<br />In the final analysis, Byrne stresses the support given intelligence by social interaction.  Brain size is a factor, he argues, but size must be correlated with other factors.  Byrne's use of various studies give this contention strong support.  He relates studies showing that enlargement of the neocortex is observed in large ape species who range over extensive areas. He traces a new lineage on our evolutionary path from primitive mammals through large-brained, rapidly-learningspecies to linguistic species.

He possesses a spirit of adventure that may exceed both.  His twenty years of exploring the mysteries of New Guinea are superbly outlined and related in this engaging account.  Although a mammalogist by profession, his interests range far beyond any academic discipline.  We follow his efforts to meet and gain acceptance by the remote peoples of the New Guinea highlands.  They are a diverse lot, and every new contact is fraught with uncertainty.  He introduces us to the teasing pleasures of New Guinea pidgin, a language adopted by indigineous peoples to cross the nearly 1 000 languages that exist on the island.<br />Throwim' Away Leg, New Guinean pidgin for a journey, is an appropriate title for this book.  Flannery's 15 long-term expeditions took him over most of the island, meeting the people, tracking animals and assessing the changes in the ecology.  It is difficult, in this jet travel age to comprehend the impact of \\"remote people,\\" but Flannery has done it.  He's adept at sharing the wonder he felt in his travels.  We feel his fears, his joys of discovery, his sadness at the incursion of industrial civilization in an unprepared land.  Flannery's account is given with an astonishing detachment.  He recognizes the needs of both the indigenous people and the invaders.  Cannibalism, so abhorrent to \\"civilized\\" readers, is placed in its true framework as viewed by the New Guinean mountain peoples.  He's aware of the population pressures on local resources among the tribes, not excusing, but imparting rare understanding of the reality of life in wilderness.<br />The author's love of wildlife is made clear throughout the book.  An encounter with three-metre-long python that tried desperately to throttle him is related with incredible compassion.  One can only sympathize with the pilot and passengers who shared the cockpit of a small aircraft with it on its journey to Port Moresby.  Flannery's real feelings, however, are for the varieties of tree kangaroos living on the island.  He asserts the high point of his travels was the classification of a rare black and white species of this creature.  High point, indeed!  Three<br />thousand metres up in the New Guinean highlands, local hunters brought him the chewed remains of two \\"Dingisios\\" - enough to identify and describe this rare animal.<br />Flannery's enthusiasms and vivid desriptive powers make this book an unforgettable read.  His descriptions of the impact of outsiders, from both East and West, portray a land under immense stress.  Not only Western mining and lumber companies, who have seared the landscape with roads, mines and felling, but Indonesia's settlement programmes come under his penetrating gaze.  He recognizes their needs, but urges better forms of accomodation are required.  The biological story is conveyed well integrated with social, political and environmental issues.  An all-encompassing study, this book will give the reader many fresh insights and topics for further reflection.t Moresby.

Connie Barlow's own reaction is as good an example as any, stating she could return to a childhood feeling of &quot;science as nature which had been utterly quenched by schooling in science as facts.&quot;  That dichotomy is the theme of this fine collection of essays - is the Gaia thesis viable, or has &quot;science as fact&quot; overthrown it?  Barlow has assembled a strong group of authors to present for us to help in forming our own judgments.  Even better, the list of works she draws from or points to allow each of us to delve into the subjects with open eyes, and, one hopes, open minds.<br />The title of the book imparts its structure, working from the grand picture to finer detailed areas.  Barlow begins the collection with Lovelock's own definition of the Gaia concept - &quot;the biosphere is a self-regulating entity.&quot;  He ties his image to historical roots as well as scientific findings.  Reminding us that &quot;even scientists, who are notorious for their indecent curiosity, shy away from defining life,&quot; Lovelock is able to define Gaia beyond the normal environment we consider the realm of life.  &quot;Gaia,&quot; he says, &quot;is a total planetary being.&quot;  As Barlow notes in her afterword to Lovelock's presentation, &quot;some scientists . . . have wholeheartedly begun the search for Gaian mechanisms.&quot;<br />Although not an outspoken supporter, Lewis Thomas, well known for his commentaries on science, is described by Barlow as viewing &quot;the Earth's atmosphere in a Gaian sort of way.&quot;  A stronger form of support is presented through the career of Lynn Margulis.  research in how a cell is constructed and how that structure evolved was forced into a wholly new way of thinking by Margulis.  Her detailed cell research led her to propose that many organelles within the cell are the result of ancient symbiotic relationships.  Strongly opposed for several years, her theories are now the consensus view of cell evolution.  Barlow sees the idea as a foundation stone for the Gaia hypothesis.  Previously unrecognized alliances are now a major part of biological research, and Barlow includes several descriptive essays on this<br />phenomenon.<br />A Gaian organism requires a discernible structure, according to Barlow.  Arthur Koestler is used to introduce how hierarchical structures are perceived in nature.  Instead of tedious labeling of sub- after sub, Koestler introduces the term &quot;holon&quot; to define these organizational elements.  Any individual of any species may be a &quot;holon,&quot; as may be any societal group.  The term is implied in following essays on &quot;systems&quot; or &quot;organized complexity.&quot;  Various commentators are incorporated in Barlow's collection to explain how Gaia works as an entity instead of just a collection of life forms.  Game theory is introduced as a major aspect of interaction and cooperation both among and between Gaia's components.  For example, Edward O. Wilson's science of sociobiology provides a framework for explaining such concepts as altruism and aggression.<br />Opposing the Gaia thesis, since much of its popular appeal rests with those seeking greater respect for the environment, is often considered an assault on &quot;motherhood.&quot;  Barlow uses three outspoken critics of Wilson to introduce alternate views.  Richard Lewontin has derided sociobiology and its offshoots such as Lovelock's Gaia as &quot;just-so&quot; stories.  Barlow draws on his writings attacking sociobiology as examples of &quot;bad science.&quot;  By projection, his criticisms must reach beyond societal species to the entire Gaian thesis.  The ultimate, if indirect, challenge to Lovelock's idea is that of Richard Dawkins.  Barlow uses citations from The Selfish Gene to show how life is based on the survival down many generations of the gene.  Life, Dawkins demonstrates, functions on gene replication.  Hence, Gaia, which has no genetic root, cannot be a viable &quot;organism&quot; as postulated by Lovelock.  Barlow cites Dawkins' analysis of the evolution of consciousness as &quot;the most powerful passages&quot; in the book.<br />In an interesting innovation, Barlow concludes the book with some &quot;update&quot; essays by some of the contributors.  Margulis, Wilson, John Maynard Smith and others, are given the opportunity to amplify on Barlow's selections.  The final submissions are nearly as valuable as the ones she originally used.  Her own final essay is an excellent summation and provides a suggestion that the views are perhaps not as disparate as a superficial look might indicate.  Superficial this book is not.

Since the fading of the Cold War, he's demonstrated his continuing ability to weave a plot and image people apart from those in the espionage game.  In this book, the Russians are still with us, but in a whole new light - they're active capitalists trying to make a ruble.  Any way they can.  Flogging \\"clean Caucasoid blood\\" to the West is merely an opening gambit, but it's a start.  In support of this immaculate enterprise, the financial house of Single is recruited for money management.  Tiger Single, the senior partner, with his son Oliver, are set to reap a fortune.  Certain events impair the smooth flow of cash, and the Russian partners turn to a new means of profit-making, drugs.  As a lawyer in a financial management organization, Oliver draws the line at drugs.  It jeopardizes the future of the firm, and his own.  He informs on his father to government officials in the hope of cutting a deal.<br />Like many other Le Carre novels, this one eschews a simple linear plot format.  You are offered a thread to study, then another seemingly unrelated, one.  You must carry the information you're given when other threads emerge.  But Le Carre never leaves you hanging or lost.  The threads begin to come together in the rich tapestry Le Carre is so talented at weaving.  Nothing is inevitable, the twists are sometimes abrupt, but never implausible.  There are no real weaknesses in this plot.  Some of the characterization, however, seems a bit contrived, unusual in Le Carre.<br />Although not an espionage novel, Le Carre draws Oliver as if he was a George Smiley operative.  He goes to ground with amazing skill for a lawyer, his cover the performance of children's magic shows.  Oliver maintains this role long enough to marry, bear a daughter and complete a divorce.  He is \\"run\\" by a Brock who teaches him tradecraft, which in Oliver's case only requires some touching up, not attending the whole course.  Oliver is loved or admired by more women than one man deserves - his landlady, a Russian gangster's wife and Aggie, one the Brock's agents.  Somehow, given Aggie's role, this last seems the least plausible.<br />As with other post-Cold War Le Carre novels, this one is as much education as entertainment.  You close the last page but you find closing down the memories and topics more difficult.  International blood traffic is a real issue, exactly as pharmaceuticals were in The Constant Gardner.  The issues are real, the people mostly convincing, the events hidden from the public eye, but revealing in their likelihood.  Any Le Carre novel is worth a read, some welcoming a revisit.

This fine collection of essays provides an overview of the state of research on the mind/brain.  Avoiding deeply technical or metaphysical issues [although not ignoring either] these essays describe some of the structural elements of the brain, how those elements guide our behaviour and what implications may be derived from this understanding.  Roberta Conlan has chosen her authors well.  Each selection clearly conveys its topic with supportive information and useful graphics to aid our grasp of the subject.  This book is a fine starting point for any study of how the brain works, both physically and cognitively.<br />The underlying theme throughout the essays is the evolutionary process.  How has adaptation led the human brain to today's conditions?  In any study of the brain, it is the abnormalities that provide focus.  These essayists accept that both genetics and environment work together to create the dispositions humans now possess.  No single element can be isolated in understanding how the brain functions.  Beginning with the physical, especially the neuron's structure and operation, they move on to demonstrate how changes in brain chemistry can lead to addictions, mood swings and even creativity.  The authors don't shun the many ethical questions about brain research or therapies.  However, they insist that a new framework for psychological studies is required, one based on evolutionary, hence, biological foundations.  In essayist Eric Kandel's words, &quot;Everything is organic.&quot;<br />If any of the essays must be selected as the outstanding one, it is J.Allan Hobsan's study of sleep and dreaming.  He describes the neurochemistry of dreaming before relating studies of both human and animal dream indicators.  Hobsan postulates five distinct sleep periods, REM [Rapid Eye Movement] sleep with Recognizing that relating dream content is fraught with imponderables, he nevertheless builds a case for a biological basis for dreams.<br />With the rapid advances being made in human cognitive studies, many works are quickly outdated.  This book provides a foundation for analysing and assessing updating publications.  It's a worthwhile investment and will retain a useful place on anyone's shelves for some time to come.  Read it to find out how it will help understand yourself and those around you.  You won't be disappointed.es being made in human cognitive studies, many works are quickly outdated.

The elusive memory, the intense events, the apparent ability to foretell the future have all been characteristics of dreams. Fortunes gained, kingdoms and religions established or overthrown, even an important chemistry discovery, the benzene ring, is attributed to a dream.  The mystery of dreams was thought to have been exposed by Freud, who declared them expressions of repressed emotions.  Owen Flanagan has swept away many of the myths surrounding dreams.  His aim is to examine dreaming in an evolutionary perspective.  Since human consciousness is the product of natural selection, then dreams, as form of deep consciousness, must have an evolutionary role.  Flanagan simply dismisses this assumption as false, arguing that dreams are too random an event be an evolutionary adaptive role.  Dreams are a mental &quot;accident&quot; of little value.<br />In building his case, Flanagan opens with a startling proviso.  He resurrects Stephen Gould's outmoded analogy applying architectural terms to biological processes.  Gould's famous [and fatuous] use of the spandrel - a triangular form resting on the curve of an arch, derives from a 1976 article.  Flanagan uses the analogy to declare dreams as &quot;spandrels&quot; but follows two contradictory themes in expressing it.  In one, the spandrel is an necessary part of the arch - true if the arch supports anything like an aqueduct or roadway.  In the other, the spandrel is not an essential part of an arch - true if you simply build an arch that has no other role.  This issue wouldn't be terribly important except that it's the essence of Flanagan's argument and why he makes it.<br />Flanagan is at some pains to show there's no apparent evolutionary role for dreams.  Sleep, of course, is another matter.  Flanagan shows how many &quot;rest&quot; functions occur during sleep, with reduced impact on both brain and body allowing restoration.  These are clearly &quot;adaptive&quot; traits to help the body survive.  What role does dreaming play, then?  Flanagan uses Gould's arguments and tactics to rule out dreaming as an adaptation because he can perceive no reason for dreams' occurrence.  Flanagan adopts another Gould phrase, &quot;exaptation,&quot;  a trait that emerges in the past in one role which changes over time to assume another.  No &quot;exaptive&quot; role can be discerned for dreams either, according to Flanagan.  With &quot;exaptations,&quot; you never know what they are until they've proven their worth as adaptations.  By Flanagan's reasoning, everything is a Gouldian &quot;spandrel&quot; until you can properly assess its adaptive worth - some time in the next million years or so.  Like Gould in his original essay, Flanagan provides no evidence for his claim since there is no means to discern any.<br />Flanagan's style is impressive in most respects.  His descriptions are clear and his thesis forcefully presented.  Prose skills, however, don't replace evidence.  He provides a perplexing disclaimer on why only his own dreams are offered as data.  He stresses that he sought dream evidence from family and friends, but that all denied him permission.  With the wealth of published dream examples in the literature, this singular approach borders on the astonishing.  Although examples of particular dreams have but little bearing on his thesis, it remains puzzling why he fails to use them to bolster, or challenge for refutation, his own case.  A provocative book in many ways, it will be a challenge to scholars in human cognitive studies.  Recommended chiefly for the professional, it yet provides an entertaining, if not informative read.ot; traits to help the body survive.  What role does dreaming play, then?

Essayist of the American scene for the New Yorker magazine, McPhee is a lodestone for people unheralded, forgotten or simply unknown.  When you read his accounts of their lives and work, his use of language, image, empathy will instill them in your memory.  There, they will be cherished, later re-examined to be reflected on, or valued, or best of all, emulated.  All his subjects are worthy role examples, but that is only a part of the value of reading McPhee's accounts of their lives.  His scope is vast, bringing together personalities, history - often at some depth, and other related information.  All this seems to pale in the light of his ability form sentences that lead you into novel worlds, elevate your interest in something unexpected, or simply describe an otherwise mundane event.<br />This book starts with a shock - cattle rustling isn't a practice limited to Hollywood's false sense of history.  Cattle duffing remains an active practice in Nevada.  Branding, the symbol of ownership, is still subject to the &quot;running iron&quot; in shifting title without accompanying cash exchange.  Law enforcement is not applied by gun-toting marshals, but by a Brand Inspector marking tallies in the palm of his hand.  McPhee escorts one across vast stretches of the Basin and climbs thousands of feet over the Range to &quot;take attendance&quot; of cattle like a country schoolmarm.  There's little limit to how far he must travel - tracking moving cattle may lead him to California or southern Utah.  McPhee's descriptions of the country are more than matched by his relation of successful apprehensions of rustlers.  His account brings the action into sharp focus and you are beside the Inspector staking out a mountain hideaway.<br />McPhee raises the term &quot;investigative journalist&quot; to fresh levels of excellence.  Other topics in this collection include word processing for a blind author, understanding gravel as evidence, exotic automobiles and the travels and travails of a glacial boulder - a special one.  His guidance through these topics is sure, keeping your interest at a peak as he conveys a wealth of information and character description.  As with any McPhee book, this one remains timeless.

Preparation requires knowledge of the path, the likely hazards, and how to avoid awkward detours.  When the trail passes through a disputed area, every risk is multiplied.  In this instance, the dispute is interpreting how Darwin's idea of natural selection works.  Andrew Brown makes a valiant effort to learn the route, chart the perils and keep to the centre.  Even his vivid writing skills can't prevent him failing on nearly every count.  Granted, the best informed writers have stumbled on the same trek.  Brown, however, misses the whole point of the dispute.<br />His Foreward states that \\"Darwinian explanations\\" about the world have led to acrimonious scientific debate.  The remainder of the book tries to outline those debates and their participants.  The tragic story of George Price, a transplanted American who died in London in 1974, reveals the issue.  Price had reformulated William Hamilton's earlier work on altruism.  Nature, it seemed, offered little reward for altruism.  The knowledge sent Price first into insanity, then suicide.  The Hamilton/Price work brought Richard Dawkins to develop his idea of \\"the selfish gene.\\"  Brown struggles to comprehend Dawkins' idea that strings of molecules \\"desire\\" only to replicate.  He turns to Dawkins' appearance and antecedents to relieve his confusion.  He scorns Dawkins use of metaphor, labelling him \\"vulgar\\",  then fills<br />this book with his own.  Dawkins becomes the label for thinkers in one side of Brown's Darwin Wars - the \\"Dawkinsians.\\"  Although admitting its weakness, Brown retains the identification throughout.<br />The Dawkinsians are countered by the allies of Stephen J. Gould - \\"the pope of paleontology.\\"  Brown is clearly in awe of Gould's writing ability and reputation for accuracy.  Unfortunately, Brown's veneration shields him from another of Gould's talents - the building of artificial targets for scathing assaults.  Brown is more correct in his labelling of \\"Gouldians,\\" since his quotes of Gould, Lewontin and Rose follow the long-established pattern.  Lewontin characterized E.O. Wilson's Sociobiology as \\"bad science,\\" even in the face of later work supporting it.  Brown notes that Gould, Lewontin and Rose stood aligned against the rising science of evolutionary psychology.  There's another aspect of Gouldians Brown favours.  Brown, an athiest who writes for religious journals [i'm not making this up!], sympathizes<br />with Gould's \\"respect\\" for religions as opposed to Dawkins' argument that \\"any religion is irrational.\\"  Ultimately, when Brown takes an capricious detour later in the book, grants Gould and his \\"position\\" acceptable.<br />The detour is into the realm of philosophy.  It's bad enough for a religion writer to attempt to write on science.  Brown's excursion into science-cum-philosophy is wholly unwarranted.  All the more so when he openly admits his inadequacies.  Gould's most incisive critic isn't Dawkins, it's philosopher Daniel C. Dennett.  Brown confesses his failure to understand Dennett's \\"Consciousness Explained,\\" although that excellent book is but thinly related to Brown's theme.  The real thrust is Dennett's \\"Darwin's Dangerous Idea,\\" which Brown doesn't understand either, but he fails to state that as openly.  Brown claims DDI is a \\"freshly ground axe,\\" instead of a surgically precise instrument eviscerating Gould's misuse of evidence.  Because Dennett isn't a biologist, Brown accuses him of a \\"let's you and him fight\\" attitude, running from the fray after initiating it.  Anyone who has read Dennett will never forgive such a slander.  As a counter to Dennett, Brown gambits British philosopher Mary Midgley \\"in her large, sensible shoes.\\"  Besides her footwear, Midgely contributed only \\"her gift for the eviscerating phrase\\" to the debate.  Her science, even Brown admits, was \\"confused and ignorant.\\"  Perhaps Brown is correct in assigning her to the Gouldian faction.<br />Brown fails to directly come to grips with the fundamental issue.  How did natural selection produce thinking humans, and what, if any, is their role in the universe?  After his tour of the biological battleground, he uses a cute chapter title, \\"How the Meme Raths Outgrabe\\" to again display his faulty understanding of Dawkins.  Brown uses Dawkins' idea of the \\"meme,\\" a replicable idea, to introduce a discussion of \\"morality.\\"  This was the issue that drove Price to suicide, Brown reminds us.  Is the universe benevolent, offering some hope in the face of injustice?  Or is it malign, a condition which brings Midgley again forward to declare as \\"madness.\\"  Brown, however, fails to consider the proper alternative - the universe is indifferent.  If he'd read Dennett instead of maligning him, Brown might have caught the point.<br />There's some value in this book in the introduction of some issues and a few of the personalities.  If you wish to understand why the Darwin Wars came about, however, you must turn to the sources.  A compromise option is Ullica Segerstrale's Defenders of the Truth.  Although excellent, its focus is on the American participants, which, thankfully, omits Midgley.n fails to directly come to grips with the fundamental issue.

Some years past, a colleague suggested a year of travel instead of my intended return to school.  It took thirty years to fulfill that suggestion.  David Short didn't require any more prompting than a dull, dirty and dangerous job.  His destination, prompted by a world-traveling grandfather, became Central America, specifically, the Panama Canal.  The journey lasted just short of six months and resulted in this account of his adventures.  A spirited read, An Odd Odyssey should inspire anyone of nearly any age to pull up stakes at least once in a lifetime and venture somewhere distant.  Short's account shows how richly rewarding travel can be to those willing to make the effort.<br />There are two kinds of travel books - the \\"guidebook\\" with sights, prices, accommodation ideally suited for those seeking comfort instead of adventure.  Glossy photos, usually portraying conditions found on movie sets, detailed maps, prices listed.  The other type is the personal journal, which, properly done, imparts a far better sense of \\"being there\\" than does the guidebook.  Short's chronicle is the second type, a vivid sharing of his thoughts, experiences, disasters, even love.  The means of travel was by bus.  Just finding one was fraught with hazards - timing, crowding or even just running.  Once boarded, there was the issue of finding the proper seat:  \\"Sit in the rear.  Bandits will shoot through the front window.\\"  On a limited budget the \\"guidebook\\" hotels were out of the question for Short.  Many havens he found for a night's rest became adventures in their own right.  Weather, ever a primary topic for travellers, added its own quirks - a major Caribbean hurricane being the most spectacular.<br />These minor discomforts aside, Short's recital of his travels points up the many benefits of journeying solo.  One of these is that you don't remain alone for long.  Not every acquaintance is a welcome companion, but none are dull.  They bring their lives into his view, and to ours.  Short meets former convicts, travellers from Europe, Canada and Australia.  Not limiting himself to fellow \\"gringos\\" he deals well with the local residents.  Although a few are not as friendly as he - he's robbed twice and has the usual tangles with bureaucrats, cheating taxi drivers and sullen hoteliers.  Still, he maintains his equanimity, exhibiting strength in adverse circumstances.  In this modern age he can turn to internet cafes, at one point spending more on email and 'net surfing than on accommodation and food.<br />Short is a learner, eager to know the current and historical conditions of the lands he visits.  Teotihuacan, Tikal and the world's largest stone sphere.  His account leads you along with him in fine descriptive prose.  He shares his learning without becoming pedantic or opinionated.  His judgments result of thoughtful assessment and it's easy to agree with them.  The book becomes not only the tale of his journey, but a guidebook without gloss or sham.  By the end of it, we envy his adventures and his ability to relate them.  It's hard not to embark on a similar jaunt with the aim of duplicating his effort for your chosen locale..

It's a complicated task, with so little physical evidence to support his endeavour.  Still, he uses what there is with commendable ability.  In presenting the development of intelligence, he falls back on three metaphorical images - the Swiss Army Knife, cathedral architecture and a dramatic play.  The Swiss Army knife is a collection of specialized tools, each applied without relation to the others.  You don't decork a wine bottle while trimming your fingernails.  The cathedral is comprised of a central nave with connecting chapels.  The chapels only connect to each other as intelligence develops.  The drama is the history of hominid evolution, vague and obscure in the beginning, growing more discernible with more fossil evidence.<br />As with most cognitive studies, Mithen's book summarizes what is known of the similarity of chimpanzee [our nearest relative] intellect and abilities in contrast with our own.  As do many of his colleagues, he finds our primate cousins lacking in all but minimal skills.  With the chimpanzees thus disposed of, he moves to examine the hominid record.  This is the great strength of this work.  Instead of the usual tactic of portraying what is known of today's human intellect and projecting backward, Mithen starts at the beginnings of human evolution to carry his argument forward.  Along the way he utilizes anthropology, morphological studies, even climate and geography.  He uses evidence well, assuming little and carefully building the model.  Key points in the narrative are two periods of hominid brain enlargement, which he uses to enhance his model of special \\"intelligences.\\"<br />With the earliest hominids having only a Swiss Army knife array of mental tools, each segment of intelligence had to develop independent of the others.  According to Mithen, this situation led to each \\"tool\\" building a separate \\"chapel\\" in the mind.  Based on a central \\"nave\\" of \\"general\\" intelligence - keeping the body going, food gathering, sex - new intelligences would arise around it.  These new intelligences are technical, natural, social and linguistic.  Each operated independently of the others, so that tool-making enhanced \\"technical\\" intelligence, while learning about bird migration or fruiting seasons developed \\"natural\\" intelligence.  The Swiss Army knife aspect prevented these intelligences from interacting until the emergence of Homo sapiens.  Then, according to Mithen, a \\"cognitive fluidity\\" tore through the walls of the \\"intelligence chapels\\" to acquire the broad range of abilities the mind exhibits today.  While direct evidence of all this activity is, necessarily missing, the forceful presentation and elegant logic make it all a captivating read.<br />It's easy to critique Mithen's thesis.  All you need is a competitive model of cognition.  However, that would be unfair to what he has achieved, a carefully synthesized model of how human intelligence developed.  Even without bringing in a competitive thesis, Mithen falls down in two important areas.  After lengthy discussion of tool-making enhancing \\"technical\\" intelligence and its role in developing hunter-gatherer societies, he blithely omits any input from the \\"gathering\\" half of those communities.  While rarely mentioning that tool-makers/hunters are almost exclusively male, even among chimpanzees, he restricts mention of female roles to the need to give birth to small-headed babies.  He also depicts the changing of \\"social\\" intelligence associated with grooming in early hominids to the development of speech later.  He ignores the possibility that speech is just as likely to have arisen within the community of females, who had greater reason to utilize it.<br />The second major flaw is his conclusion on how modern minds evolved from earlier ones.  He argues that the \\"social\\" intelligence became the tool that opened the walls of his \\"intelligence chapels\\" of thecathedral.  Since there is no reason to believe that intelligence should be so pigeon-holed as Mithen makes it, \\"social intelligence\\" as an integrating force is vague at best.  Although i promised not to employ a competitive thesis, it's difficult not to refer the reader to Daniel C. Dennett's Multiple Drafts model of consciousness.  If Mithen had consulted Dennett's Consciousness Explained, instead of blithely dismissing it, he would have discovered that his cathedral and chapels would have been built up over time instead of needing serious renovation at the end.  Mithen would have been able to use the same evidence, indeed, the same metaphors, but with progressive construction instead of building then redecorating.  Knocking down mental walls is not a satisfactory technique to build intellect.  Instead, Mithen should have kept the theatre metaphor, which he restricts to history, and built up his drama from a soliloquy to a full cast epic.  That would have allowed him to enlarge mental capacities through new players, scenery changes, improved interaction among the cast, perhaps with himself taking the final bow.  Given the work he's obviously put into this and the wealth of evidence he's considered and offered us, a smattering of applause [after a careful reading of the libretto] is not out of order.of the cathedral.

This concept was given philosophic definition by historian Frederick Jackson Turner at the end of the 19th Century.  Although Turner fell into disrepute in the liberal 1960s, Tim Flannery has resurrected him as the voice best expressing the &quot;frontier dream&quot; of unlimited expansion.  and the environment in which it formed.  More important for our future, Flannery shows how this attitude persists and is expanding around the planet.  This remarkable synopsis of a continent's restoration presents a vividly detailed, compelling read of our past, present and future prospects.  Flannery chronicles the changes in climate, geography and evolution's experiments leading to today's conditions.<br />Flannery opens with a vivid account of the great catastrophe signalling the extinction of the dinosaurs.  The wandering rockball that slammed into the remnants of the Bearpaw Sea 65 million years ago reset the evolutionary clock.  Because of its position above the target site, North America became a hotbed of evolutionary diversity after the collision.  A setting dominated by North-South running mountain ranges [where East-West is the usual pattern elsewhere] gave rise to severe changes in weather, with resulting adjustments of life forms.  Megafauna, the giant animals that ultimately dominated the landscape, ranged across the prairies.  They included the uintatheres - triple-horned giants, the first camels, horses and sheep-sized animals whose herds covered the land.  Flannery shares his awe of life's diversity on this continent during the period of recovery after the asteroid's devastation.<br />Flannery depicts a wedge-shaped North America as &quot;a trumpet&quot; with the capacity to amplify weather conditions.  When climate conditions changed slightly elsewhere, they were embellished here.  The result was seen in both flora and fauna as plants and their herbivore predators adjusted.  Conditions finally combined to produce the masses of ice that penetrated deeply south.  Flannery tracks the gateways into North America left by the erratic ice [he also concedes that Canada's fossil record was nearly scraped away by the frozen cliffs].  The most significant creature to find a path from elsewhere, of course, proved to be &quot;the hunting ape.&quot;<br />The entry of humanity to this nearly unique stage brought truly immense change.  Flannery recounts the disappearance of many species of animals, nearly all of them the remnants of the earlier megafauna.  No other predator, and not climate, he contends, could have exterminated so many animals so quickly.  Only humans, with their organization and weapons could have devastated the megafauna.  He shows how the same time frames have parallels in Australia and the Pacific.  The bison survived the initial invasion due to their large herd size and mobility.<br />The European wave of human invasion was the most devastating.  These new immigrants brought something new in their baggage - technology.  New forms of manufacture and transportation overwhelmed the North American scene, transforming drastically.  Farming changed from small plots to vast acreages.  These installations required mechanical devices for tilling and harvesting.  More importantly, they demanded water.  In the West, where farming was at best a marginal enterprise, Flannery relates the environmental stress dam building caused.  New manufacturing and transportation systems required minerals, which were to be found in the Basin and Range.  Mining, damming, ranching intruded on the natural environmental patterns yet became the basis for what is termed &quot;the American System.&quot;  For Flannery, this frontier economy remains entrenched as the foundation of American thinking.  &quot;Globalization&quot; is nothing more than the extension of the &quot;System&quot; expanded to remainder of the world irrespective of its relevance elsewhere.<br />Flannery, however, doesn't view the disruption as irreversible.  He urges a full understanding of pre-human invasion conditions as a basis for restorative action.  He doesn't believe in setting aside &quot;wilderness areas&quot; as a conservation measure.  His prescription is a pro-active approach - the re-introduction of large herbivores to recover lost ecologies.  African and Indian elephants introduced to the western prairies, for example, would aid in restoring depleted grasslands.  He examines other indicators that suggest North Americans can stop the resource-depleting juggernaut, each of which the reader must consider carefully and with and open mind.<br />There are few flaws in this book.  The indexer needs to enter a study program with a good thesaurus, and the money spent on glossy colour photographs might better have gone to more line diagrams.  These are petty considerations next to the book's important message.  Every student in North America should be given a copy of this book.  It is, after all, their future Flannery is addressing.s relevance elsewhere.<br />Flannery, however, doesn't view the disruption as irreversible.

Frans de Waal has taken the lead position in the swelling ranks of researchers clarifying the picture of humanity's place in nature.  Combining his own and others' study of the great apes, he presents us a vivid survey of primate behaviour.  His roots and experience are combined in this fascinating account.  His Dutch background, American academic position, and keen observing powers have led him to redefine our view of our primate relatives.  His critical insights are matched by his prose skills in presenting them, making this informative work a pleasure to read.  There is much to be learned from de Waal.  He removes any remaining doubt that we are at one with our fellow creatures.<br />De Waal challenges the dominant view among Western researchers that animal studies must be done from a detached view.  He stresses the distinction between &quot;anthropocentrism&quot; and &quot;anthropomorphism.&quot;  The former sharply divides humans from the remainder of the animal kingdom, holding &quot;culture&quot; as a unique human artefact.  The second, properly applied, enables us to view all the animal kingdom in a broader scale.  De Waal cites the long history of Japanese primate research and more recent Western efforts as examples of the difference.  The Eastern world integrates animals within its cultures while the Western view is humanity has been given &quot;dominion&quot; over them.  In a practical sense, this outlook gave the Japanese a head start in primate research.  They consider each individual in chimpanzee troops, where Westerners only perceive the group as an entity.<br />As de Waal escorts us through the last half-century of primate research, he assess the contributions of each of the major figures in the field.  Lorenz, Tinbergen, Desmond Morris from the West are contrasted with their Eastern counterparts.  Of particular importance is Japan's Imanishi Kinji a towering figure in primatology, almost unknown here.  Imanishi's outlook was a near refutation of Darwin's natural selection.  Imanishi rejected the idea that animal behaviour is genetically driven and began the redefinition of &quot;culture&quot; based on his studies of primates.  With &quot;culture's&quot; many restraints cast away, Japanese researchers could perceive behaviour little noted in the West.<br />Some of de Waal's examples are breathtaking.  Animal art occupies a chapter, dominated by examples of chimpanzee attitudes while they work.  Dedicated attention, care in application and possessive attitudes lead to paintings equal to Pollock's and applauded by Picasso.  Pigeons turn away from Schoenberg [and who can blame them] in favour of Bach.  From the obverse angle, the number of human composers who have relied on birds and other animals for inspiration range from Mozart down.  The message is clear: &quot;culture&quot; is an aspect of the entire  animal kingdom.  We are but a part of a universal condition.<br />It's de Waal's message about animal learning that tumbles the final barricade between humans and their kin.  The title of this book is derived from apprentice sushi chefs spending years merely observing a master until they can demonstrate their own abilities.  In a similar manner, our ape cousins learn by watching and imitating.  The young may be better at learning than the old.  One community may develop new habits unseen elsewhere.  Later practitioners may add improvements to style and technique.  Learning, however, is not limited to &quot;wise man.&quot;  It's a trait that may be applied to any species with sufficient intellect and dexterity to demonstrate it.<br />De Waal's presentation challenges the entire scholarship of thinking about evolution.  He will not accept the &quot;traditional&quot; view of human uniqueness in culture or learning capacity.  Nor does he accept the more recent &quot;selfish gene&quot; thesis of innate adaptation traits.  His balanced view will force many to rethink their ideas to arrive at a new synthesis of humanand animal behaviour patterns.  The book is a clear assertion that much research remains to be undertaken in improving our understanding of where evolution has led us.  A provocative, thought stimulating book, yet highly readable, makes this effort worthy of the accolades it has received.and animal behaviour patterns.

John McPhee here acts as a catalyst in stimulating reactions between the Archdruid, David Brower, and three of his antagonists.  As a catalyst, McPhee deals with each pairing in the most detached way possible.  Even so long after its original publication, the attitudes expressed by the mineral engineer, the dam builder and resort developer through McPhee's superb journalism remain with us.  He succeeds admirably at that in relating these confrontations, while his writing skills keep you aware of him at all times.  Brower, a towering figure in several senses, is portrayed in an almost subdued manner.  The strength of his message, however, so appropriate today, is conveyed by McPhee as a muffled riptide.<br />Join McPhee as he struggles over copper-bearing mountains with Brower and geologist Charles Park.  Park &quot;would move the White House if there was copper under it.&quot;  To Park, mineral extraction is mandated by the need of Americans to maintain the lifestyle they've achieved in the 20th Century.  Brower argues that lifestyle growth must slow its pace to retain the remaining natural resources.  Park counters Brower's desire to protect the wilderness with assertions that &quot;managed mining&quot; will achieve both aims.  Park argues that mining need not destroy wilderness and that Glacier Peak's hiking trails will not be lost because copper is removed from its innards.  Does this sound familiar?<br />The Archdruid's second encounter is with the rather more flamboyant Charles Fraser.  Fraser has a winning track record in development, particularly golf courses.  He wants to &quot;open&quot; an island off the Carolina coast.  The island, &quot;a third larger than Manhattan, has a population of eleven people.&quot;  Fraser sees that condition as disproportionate.  When Brower disagrees, Fraser dubs him the Archdruid - contending that 'conservationists' are 'preservationists.'  &quot;Modern druids worship trees and sacrifice human beings to those trees,&quot; Fraser contends.  The humans being sacrificed are golfers and others who can afford to visit the offshore island Fraser wants to &quot;develop.&quot;  Fraser, like Park, understands the need of Americans to return to a remembered uncongested frontier condition, if only temporarily.<br />The western frontier becomes the site of McPhee's concluding essay.  In the West, more than anywhere else in North America, water is life's blood.  Whether water is better used in a free flowing or captive condition is the subject of Brower's dispute with Floyd E. Dominy, dam builder.  McPhee follows the pair over reservoirs, deep into dams, along river courses, in his account of the &quot;water wars.&quot;  McPhee describes Dominy as &quot;a child of the hundredth meridian,&quot; that boundary between wet and dry Mid-America.  Dominy spent years capturing water for ranchers and farmers, later adding cities, casinos and boaters to his clientele.  Along the Colorado River, deep in the Grand Canyon, McPhee records Brower and Dominy debating the impact of damming western rivers.<br />We have lost David Brower.  If there's a finer memorial than McPhee's account, point it out.  The issues related here aren't resolved today, giving this book an unexpected endurance. John McPhee has performed an incomparable feat in aligning the attitudes and expressions of the &quot;developer&quot; and the &quot;environmentalist.&quot;  Clear choices are made apparent, but as McPhee reminds us, neither Brower nor his contenders are the ones who will make the decisions - it is you, the reader.&quot;Modern druids worship trees and sacrifice human beings to those trees,&quot; Fraser contends.

Sifting through a wealth of publications on evolution to distill out the significant works dealing with social issues.  Her choices necessarily reflect a broad range of opinions, scientifically sound and otherwise.  She's to be commended for providing the reader with a series of starting points to pursue in gaining a better understanding of the chosen topics.  As she admits, compiling her earlier collection of works relating to Lovelock's Gaia thesis led her to investigate the impact of biology on philosophical thinking.  This volume is the result.  In it, she deals with such matters as evolution as a &quot;progressive&quot; force, evolution and &quot;strife,&quot; and, of course, the relation of evolution to human morals and religion.  Many debates and debaters are featured with their best expressions on the topics she wishes to address.  While some authors and some topics might have been added, it is her book, not theirs.  She has performed the task well.<br />She opens with Julian Huxley, grandson of &quot;Darwin's Bulldog,&quot; who was outspoken on the &quot;worldview&quot; of the progressive role of evolution.  Huxley sees &quot;progress&quot; in evolution as the development of ways for organisms to gain increased control over their environment.  Only a selected few organisms have achieved, human beings the most obvious case.  George G. Simpson is called upon to refute Huxley's thesis, declares it a myth without substance.  He sees Huxley's idea as a typical example of anthropomorphism, stressing that &quot;man is not the measure.&quot;<br />From this introduction, Barlow moves to the &quot;tools and metaphors of evolution.&quot;  In assessing how evolution works, thinkers in biology have crafted many means of explanation.  Darwin used the concept of &quot;wedges&quot; to portray the competition for resources.  Barlow offers examinations of Darwin's use of metaphor and how it has affected later thinkers.  The key Darwinian phrase, &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; has led to various interpretations on the mechanics of evolution.<br />Barlow isn't shy about dealing with evolution and &quot;cosmic visions.&quot;  So long as humans, who appear to be the only animal with a &quot;cosmic view,&quot; investigate evolution, there will be discussions of its impact on &quot;spiritual&quot; issues.  Barlow's earlier collection certainly typifies &quot;grand schemes&quot; in evolutionary ideas.  Here, she opens with the French paleontologist de Chardin in dealing with the relationship of science and Christianity.  Not a recapitulation of the antagonisms between science and religion, the choices she's made express the struggle to put the spiritual alongside the biological.  Barlow goes far afield in bringing to her collection the widest possible range of voices.  Christian &quot;creationist&quot; Henry Morris is included with an attack on natural selection as both &quot;atheistic&quot; and a &quot;religion&quot; in its own right.  He is countered by various authors ranging from Darwin to the Pope.  It's a fitting and lively exchange with which to conclude the collection.  As she must, one supposes, Barlow attempts to reconcile many of the viewpoints using the Gaia hypothesis.  She labels this new synthesis &quot;an Earth-based spirituality&quot; combining the mechanics of evolution with an historical human need for something &quot;beyond.&quot;  In this synthesis, of course, nothing is excluded and there's room for all.inian phrase, &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; has led to various interpretations on the mechanics of evolution.<br />Barlow isn't shy about dealing with evolution and &quot;cosmic visions.&quot;  So long as humans, who appear to be the only animal with a &quot;cosmic view,&quot; investigate evolution, there will be discussions of its impact on &quot;spiritual&quot; issues.

Old attitudes and preconceptions are being swept away by newer ideas based on firm research.  Steven Pinker has assembled these results to provide an outstanding synopsis of cognitive studies.  He refers to the old views of the mind's working as &quot;mysteries.&quot;  Pinker, as a good scientist, applauds the updating of mental &quot;mysteries&quot; to &quot;problems&quot; capable of resolution.  He makes no claim to the problems all being solved, or, in a few instances, even being identified.  His approach, however, is a refreshing and innovative one, aimed at anyone wishing to gain an understanding of what it means to be human.  As might be expected from the man who wrote The Language Instinct, he's a master of illustrative example and with many anecdotes for teaching the reader.<br />Pinker uses evolutionary roots as the foundation for his presentation.  Like it or not, our genes carry a large part of our mental processes.  The mind is not a &quot;blank slate,&quot; but is born with vast supply of historical information on which to build as it matures.  The &quot;cultural environment&quot; so dear to some commentators makes only a small contribution to who we become as adults.  Even a child's peer groups influence its development more than does parental input, and by a huge margin.  This situation arises because the mind is an algorithmic processor.  It is essentially independent of an individual's environment, with a built-in learning capability to select from the wide spectrum of inputs.  To Pinker, this essentially unconstrained process is part of the evolutionary path.  Children's independence reflects the need of natural selection to sort among &quot;what is&quot; to arrive at what &quot;will be&quot; in the future.  There are certainly no guarantees of how development will proceed over generations.<br />The computational image is based on &quot;problem-solving.&quot;  When to take a step, avoid predators, seek a mate, find food.  Clearly, as Pinker states, computational mind processes are as universal as brains.  Therefore, in Pinker's view, each brain develops modules for dealing with these issues.  Like any powerful computer, he stresses, the mind depends on parallel processing for flexibility.  How else, for example, could the brain control breathing while also thinking about a Mozart string trio?  As humans evolved, they either added new problem-solving modules, or improved on the inherited ones.  This is an algorithmic process - adding small instructions over time as adaptations to changing conditions.  It is clearly a universal evolutionary process that has achieved enormous expression in the human species.  Each<br />acquired &quot;tactic&quot; could be passed down through generations, with each successful transmission building on an inherited base.<br />&quot;The mind is not the brain, but what the brain does,&quot; is the key statement of the book.  Pinker supports this image with numerous examples of mind/brain functions.  Why our brain &quot;sees&quot; a three-dimensional image in a stereographic display when we know the photographs are two dimensional is but one of many instances he cites.  The various factors he proposes must not be considered as independent entities, he stresses.  The algorithmic processes form a whole, but not one based neither on conflicting elements nor particularly complementary ones.  Weightings of importance take place continually, but even the expression of an idea is not a mental &quot;victory&quot; for that particular idea.  The human mind's greatest attribute is its flexibility.<br />As with any of the recent works on cognition, Pinker's analysis isn't the final word.  Given the complexity of the mind, that is clearly an impossible goal.  Yet Pinker has broached many new concepts in this book.  All deserve further careful study.  Pinker avoids dogmatism with his elegant treatment.  This book is required in furthering your own thinking about our place in nature and deserves respect and attention.  He welcomes serious studies in the subject, even if the work appears to refute his ideas.  But he insists that the refutation must rely on solid science and not traditional dogmas.atism with his elegant treatment.

Not a journalism instructor, for which he is amply qualified, but declaiming on science, particularly geology.  McPhee is a master in understandably describing geologic processes and the people studying them.  Under his touch, the stable earth is brought to life, compressing time and traversing space.  Watching an aircraft descend for a landing, he muses that in another time its approach path would be deep under water.  He explains how different the perception of time is in the mind of a geologist from that of our own.  All civilization is but an eyeblink in contrast with the rise and fall of mountains and seas.  According to McPhee, what geologists face is summarized in one sentence:  &quot;The summit of Mount Everest<br />is marine limestone.&quot;<br />Not long ago, he reminds us, the world was once considered to be like a drying apple.  Some areas shrink driving other places to rise leaving a skin of folds.  McPhee describes the history of the idea of plate tectonics and how it confounded this earlier concept.  The starting point was an understanding of the earth's age.  A Scottish &quot;gentleman,&quot; James Hutton was an astute observer and an eloquent speaker.  Putting his findings in writing, however, &quot;trampled people with words.&quot;  Hutton revealed the vast duration of time required to form earth's vistas.  He was followed by a herald of Charles Darwin, Charles Lyell.  Between them, the age of the earth and of life replaced the established biblical origins.  In effect, Hutton had taken the next major step in science after Copernicus.  Plate tectonics, a group, rather than an individual's insight, opened new fields of research and provided more detailed views of Earth's processes.<br />Among the pictures are better indicators of finding valuable resources.<br />McPhee's other works provide testimony to his physical courage, which is immense.  Join him as he drives a twisting mountain road with a geologist on a quest:  &quot;We turned a last corner, with our inner wheels resting firmly on the road and the two others supported by Deffeyes' expectations.&quot;  McPhee has joined Kenneth Deffeyes to learn about the building of the Basin and Range - the succession of mountain strings and the valleys separating them.  Through McPhee, Deffeyes relates how the mountains were thrust up, eroding silt into the lowlands.  Mountain building forces also produce other interesting results.  Deffeyes, &quot;a big man with a tenured waistline&quot; by McPhee's description, has &quot;pure and noble purposes in coming to Nevada.&quot;  His quest for &quot;pure science&quot; investigation is one side of Deffeyes' character.  The<br />other side is his pursuit of a &quot;noble&quot; metal - silver.  Deffeyes knows of how plate tectonics works.  He also grasps the history of the Nevada mining industry.  The combination may make him a millionaire from refining abandoned mines.  But there are risks and he tells McPhee &quot; . . . if anybody comes after me, I want you to go to jail cheerfully rather than surrender your notes.&quot;  Fortunately, McPhee is still outside prison walls writing for us.<br />This first of several works on the revolution in thinking inspired by plate tectonics remains a readable and valuable book.  McPhee doesn't confine his talents to imparting what scientists do.  Arcane topics are deftly woven with our everyday lives and ambitions.  Sit beside him in a cafe in Nevada as he queries patrons on their reaction to the possibility that the sea will someday flood their region: &quot;We got a boat.&quot;  His careful balance of deep science and everyday life has received many accolades, but never quite enough.

Next time you're at the grocery, spend some time in the fruits and veggie section.  Pick up an avocado, hefting it in your hand.  You can feel the weight of that huge seed within.  Compare it with the nearby oranges or apples.  Mum warned you not to swallow the seeds when you were a child, remember?  Trees would sprout in your tummy.  No worries about trying to swallow that avocado seed, is there?  While you're squeezing that avocado, think back on autumn skies sparkling with maple or sycamore seeds fluttering in the chill winds.  Why the absurd difference in size?  Is it important?<br />Connie Barlow thinks these differences are very important.  As she reminds us, all those fruits have been around since long before humans confined them to orchards.  Winged maple seeds can flit about on the mildest breeze.  The avocado, however, clearly needs a little help finding a sprouting site.  Before orchardists, who was there to help it reach one?  Trees don't like to just drop seeds and hope for the best.  Too many seeds in one place results in choking thicket or a sunlight-blocking canopy.  The key is dispersal.  Leave home, kids, and start life somewhere else.  But a rock-sized hunk like an avocado or a honey locust needs a lift.  Who gave ancient avocados a ride to a new home?<br />According to Paul Martin and David Janzen, the carriers were animals who don't exist any more.  Barlow follows this pair of researchers who began a new scientific quest by wondering why jungle fruit was rotting under Costa Rican trees.  All life struggles to continue through succeeding generations, and lying on the ground covered in fuzz doesn't bode success.  Janzen thought there was something missing - an animal that might have conveyed the fruit elsewhere to launch the new generation.  As they studied the problem, according to Barlow, they concluded that many fruits and their seeds are living on borrowed time.  The animals that helped disseminate seeds for many trees are long extinct.<br />Barlow belongs at the head of the class for understanding and explaining how evolution works.  She shows there's more to the story than tracing single lineages with subtle adjustments in limb, leaf, or mass.  Plant life has coevolved with animal species.  In developing defenses against animals eating their foliage, plants also needed allies to spread new sprouts.  Some seeds travelled with thorns, but others were oversized for that means.  Big seeds had to be swallowed, some to be passed intact with dung, but others to initiate the germination process within the gut before passage.  All these mechanisms are specific, but the loss of partners have left many tree species vulnerable.  Some have &quot;second string&quot; dispersers, but these may not be adequate.<br />Barlow guides us around the planet and through time, introducing us to trees, their fruits and their likely seed dispersing partners.  She reminds us that North America evolved the horse, the camel and a variety of other animals that are either missing or were re-introduced.  In those days, the American camel had two sets of incisor teeth.  Current Old World camels have a lower set and a hard plate above.  New Zealand had no large mammals.  Who conveyed the seeds of fifty four species of divaricate plants around the islands?  Probably the eleven extinct species of moa native to the islands.  Why do some trees around the world have thorns that cease growing above a certain height?  There used to be taller animals that could reach the fruits convey them away.  Why did the digestive tracts of horses and cows evolve differently?  They both eat grass.  Barlow examines these and other questions with exquisite style, showing where the evidence shows well and where further work is required.  And there is plenty for the young researcher to consider following.<br />If the findings of the past weren't surprising enough, Barlow's proposals for the future will leave many astounded.  Especially farmers and ranchers.  Elephants on the Prairies?  Camels in Utah [they were there once, why not again?]  Hand planted trees where the natural dispersers have disappeared?  These are serious questions, because extinction isn't an isolated event.  Barlow points out the &quot;cascade effect&quot; engendered by all extinctions.  There are many  important reasons to read this book.  It may amaze you, but be reassured you will not be bored.ecially farmers and ranchers.  Elephants on the Prairies?

In this book, Ishmael's student is a twelve year old girl.  The adult mindsets and idealism Ishmael dealt with in the previous book are replaced by a cynical, street-wise young adult.  Julie, who is as close to an orphan as you can get and still have a resident parent, is inspired by the newspaper advert: &quot;Teacher seeking pupil.  Must have an earnest desire to save the world.&quot;  Although she hasn't a clue how to accomplish that desire, she feels compelled to give it a go.<br />If you've read &quot;Ishmael,&quot; don't assume this book is redundant.  Ishmael himself is reluctant to teach one so young.  After all, what could a 12-year-old accomplish?  Any reader of this volume might entertain the same doubts, but Quinn's adept talent has Ishmael query Julie on what she believes and why.  He's patient [unlike most adults with children] and his &quot;teaching&quot; is, in reality a means to make Julie examine her beliefs.  Ishmael is able couch his questions in terms Julie can understand.  Step by step, Ishmael prods Julie into greater awareness of that world she desires to save.  In the beginning, of course, she doesn't even know what's wrong with the world.  Her vague disquiet is given focus as Ishmael's questions prod her thinking.<br />Julie becomes aware that the basic tactic of civilization is to &quot;lock up the food.&quot;  From this situation everything else that circumscribes our lives follows.  Working for wages, a hierarchical society, religion and other trappings of &quot;culture&quot; that bind our existence.  Ishmael shows what an innovation in human experience this tactic is, and how recently imposed.  Locking up the food and creating a structured society, according to Ishmael, has led to an immensely powerful Mother Culture.  Mother Culture lays down and enforces the rules of society.  She's created a prison, which will require re-thinking about culture in order for us, the prisoners, to escape.<br />Not all societies, however, subscribe to these rules.  Mother Culture has created the Taker society, while those remaining outside her domain, Ishmael dubs the Leavers.  The division is nearly absolute, with the Takers striving to take all, while the Leavers have survived by leaving what they don't need.  Quinn assures us that the separation is neither inevitable nor absolute.  But changes in outlook are necessary if the Takers are not to destroy the planet.<br />Quinn's excellent style keeps a &quot;message&quot; book from becoming a &quot;preaching&quot; book.  That's no small accomplishment, given the immensity of the task.  He reassures us that he understands the Taker society will not revert to a pure Leaver culture.  In order to survive, however, it will be necessary for the Takers to &quot;talk to their neighbours.&quot;  Not just the folks next door, but all the rest of life.  This is not a reversion to a simpler life, but an expansion of knowledge and understanding.  It's hardly a drastic step, but it hasn't been taken.  My Ishmael encourages you to take that first step.  A better world is certain to follow, since that first step must inevitably lead to others.  Buy this book for your children or even your neighbour's children.

A collection of science essays is fraught with pitfalls for the unwary.  If the author is well known or is in high position [Tattersall is both], or even simply articulate [Tattersall is] heedless reading may result in blind acceptance.  The essay format, as Tattersall confesses in his Preface, lacks discipline.  This book reinforces that assertion with a vengeance.  The subtitle should be printed in glowing letters.  &quot;What Makes Us Human&quot; is a large topic for a book of so few pages.  After reading it, it seems to be a bit too ample for the author, as well.<br />Tattersall begins with an excellent summary of why we study science.  Too many people still equate the search for &quot;facts&quot; with a quest for &quot;truth.&quot;  The author makes a valiant attempt to explain why these ideas must be kept separate.  Since he must rely on the reader to understand this division, his success in the endeavour can only be guessed.  The quest for &quot;facts,&quot; as he ably states, often leads to a new quest for new facts.  Science, then, is an ongoing and highly cooperative effort.  Many &quot;facts&quot; unveil the need to seek further in an unrelated field of interest.  He describes &quot;science&quot; as a &quot;corporate&quot; endeavour by many people to organize and relate the facts revealed.<br />From science in general, Tattersall moves to the more specific area of the study of evolution.  After a brief presentation on Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace in development of the concept of &quot;natural selection,&quot; he goes on to deal with &quot;adaptation.&quot;  How life changes is the core of evolution and he describes the travails of early thinkers after Darwin dealt with the processes.  He describes the merging of Darwin's natural selection and the later knowledge of genetics as the &quot;Evolutionary Synthesis,&quot; which he then castigates as &quot;hardening into dogma.&quot;  This rather dark pink herring is his way of easing into a challenge of gradual change typifying evolution.  He states that &quot;speciation remains poorly understood.&quot;  Speciation may be poorly defined, but it's well understood.  By claiming speciation is &quot;poorly understood,&quot; Tattersall is free to introduce the worn-out concept of Punctuated Equilibrium, variously described as &quot;punk eek&quot; or &quot;evolution by jerks.&quot;  While he endeavours to build a case for the concept, it falls rather flat under his touch.  Adding to the reader's confusion, he offers the Gouldian term &quot;exaptation&quot; to fog the image of adaptation as the mechanism of species change.  The logic of substituting Gould's arcane term isn't presented.<br />Evolution, to most readers, is only important to humans.  Tattersall expounds on diversity, environment, cladistics [grouped traits] as his lead-in to human evolution.  At this point, however, we seem to leave the whole process of evolution behind.  Tattersall is keen to show that behaviour patterns, while deceptively common among ape-like species, branch off into something altogether different in humans.  Apes can't talk.  Apes can't learn.  Apes don't walk upright, or, according to Tattersall, have any reasoning power.  He attributes &quot;an unprecedented leap in body structure&quot; to make modern humans [&quot;punk eek&quot;, again].  From this, he derives the notion that this structure, powered by the new, improved brain, took us off the evolutionary path.<br />The key agent, according to Tattersall, is the implementation of &quot;symbolism.&quot;  Describing early hominid brains as &quot;exaptations&quot; awaiting fulfillment, he informs us that the fulfillment was &quot;culture.&quot;  He attributes &quot;symbolic processes&quot; in the brain as experience being converted to discrete symbols.  We manipulate those symbols in ways other animals cannot, and the manipulation is accomplished through speech.  To Tattersall, the innovation of &quot;cultural symbolism&quot; widens the gap between humans and the remainder of the animal kingdom.  Animal behaviour has no relation to human behaviour, and any attempt to establish that link underlies what he terms the &quot;arrogant pseudo-science of 'evolutionary psychology' .&quot;  His penultimate chapter is a denunciation of relating behaviour to genetics [although his memory gene fails him when he attributes to Shakespeare a quote of Thomas Hobbes'] which is sprinkled with reproachful buzzwords, distortion and use of newspaper headlines instead of serious research results.  His sweeping accusations make one wonder if Tattersall has read any scientific publication of the past<br />generation.<br />The essay format may be forgiven many sins.  It's not an academic treatise nor peer-reviewed scientific collection.  Indexing, for example, while useful, would be onerous in so short a book.  The lack of any further reading references, however, is inexcusable.  Given the number of people and disciplines that he maligns so vigorously, it would have been a decided service to the reader to give us some reference to his targets.  Tattersall hauls Steven Mithen up on the Gouldian charge of telling &quot;just-so&quot; stories, but fails to indicate where to read them.

TGIF meant participating in a vilification ritual.  We would gather around of volume of John McPhee, cursing his name and maligning his person.  The reason for this anomalous behaviour was, of course, envy.  He could write.  He could write science better, with lucidity and deceptive ease, than anyone else in the business.  We all aspired to emulate him, with momentous lack of success.  Of course, we read every word he published as quickly as it became available.<br />This collection of essays is a typical example of McPhee's incomparable ability to convey nature and people to our view.  In it, he covers topics as disparate as micro electrical generation companies, telephone installations in Alaska and his own namesake among the game warden staff in Maine.  It is this last story that has captured my admiration of his talents beyond nearly all others.  In it, he shows personal courage that war correspondents might envy.  Prompted to visit Maine to meet a duplicate John McPhee, ward and warden of the state's wildlife, the McPhee duality flies to count moose.  A harsh wind bends the trees below<br />as the journalist idly wonders at the wind's speed.  \\"Tell me when the trees stop moving.\\"  The float plane slows until it hovers aloft indicating a wind speed of 45 miles per hour.<br />Such expeditions are common for the man who has traversed the continent seeking the secrets of the rocks.  Closer to home in Princeton, he follows another game warden also counting - this time bears.  Even a drugged bear seems a menace, but McPhee is quick to point out that Eastern bears are peaceful collaborators with people.  Eastern Black Bears may even have changed their life habits to accommodate human contact.  Cat food is best taken from verandahs in the dark.  Besides, his contact, Patricia McConnell, takes Dunkin' Donuts to them.  It's her bait for traps as she conducts her census.<br />His people skills are not lacking, however.  In another essay he recounts the rise of paramedical services to outlying communities.  With doctors turning to arcane specialties, often richly rewarding, the general practitioner has fallen victim to evolutionary processes.  Nearly extinct, the GP's methods are being adapted by younger people following the ideal of medical service.  Rural doctors and \\"semi-doctors\\" are introducing \\"psychosocial input into physical illness.\\"  This almost revolutionary approach is restoring medical care to communities otherwise destined to long commutes or doing without.  McPhee follows their rounds, recording their abilities for our benefit.  And reminding us again of how perceptive he is and how well he conveys what he sees.<br />Reading McPhee continually raises the question, \\"what makes a good journalist\\"?  If it's training that produced his abilities, why aren't there more like him?  If it's a genetic trait, surely there are others, even his own descendants, that should share it.  Unfortunately, McPhee, like Mozart, seems unique in the ability to convey what is in his mind.  We are grateful for it.  It remains a enviable talent, and an ideal to be emulated.  Mostly, however, it produces essays that are a delight to read, and may be read again with profit.  Read him.however.

If this book doesn't bring them around, there's no hope for them.  That's sad because the story Burnham and Phelan tell us provides many interesting aspects of the genetic basis for our wants, needs, and, admittedly our failings.  They offer this information with easy wit.  The book seems deceptively simplistic in places.  Don't be deceived.  These authors are opening new doors to understanding of how our minds and bodies operate.  They point out that all these functions have evolutionary roots.  The better we understand them, the better we can deal with them.<br />Their starting point is reference to the wealth of &quot;self-help&quot; books occupying vast areas of bookstore shelf space.  &quot;Dozens of books on finding love, losing weight and creating wealth&quot; aren't matched by books on &quot;building beer guts&quot; or &quot;frivolous spending.&quot;  We already seem to have excessive talents along those lines.  Burnham and Phelan argue that we aren't addressing the problem from the proper perspective.  We need to better understand the root cause of the problems in order to cure them.  Switching to one behaviour in hope of replacing the other clearly isn't working.  So long as we fail to understand how our genes are driving our actions, we'll always fail to correct the behaviours we find objectionable.<br />The authors fill the remainder of the book with a catalogue of behaviours, from overextended debt through compulsive cravings to dealing with others.  It's a comprehensive picture, well structured and logically explained.  If you think beauty is an advertiser's invention, you'll discover a more realistic answer here.  What does &quot;gender equality&quot; really mean?  Is the marriage bond a cultural artifact, or is there a more fundamental reason why men and women enter long lasting relationships?  How well do you and your boss get along?  Burnham and Pelham address these and a multitude of other social issues.  Their answers are derived from a sound research base.  While not every answer is necessarily complete, there is enough information in this book to act as a starting point for every individual who wishes to better their own emotional state.<br />Not content to simply describe the genetic roots of many of our social ills and misconceptions, the authors move to offering strategies for improvement.  Improvement of any existing system, in this case our lives, is best undertaken in small steps.  No existing machine is ever improved by replacing the whole thing.  The authors offer piecemeal strategies for bettering our lives incrementally.  A little change here, another there and, over time little modifications result in more efficiency, cost effectiveness, perhaps even longer life.  Anyone reading the book need not anticipate drastic change in lifestyle.  This is, indeed, a form of self-help manual to help you change without noticing it.  Assuredly, there is no other such book in press with such a sound scientific base.  If you doubt the validity of their assertions, follow their directions to their web page and review the sources.

Anyone reading the book need not anticipate drastic change in lifestyle.  This is, indeed, a form of self-help manual to help you change without noticing it.  Assuredly, there is no other such book in press with such a sound scientific base.  If you doubt the validity of their assertions, follow their directions to their web page and review the sources.  It's a novel reference technique.  As they suggest, it will likely take more time than did reading the book.	2002-04-01

Any of his works will suffice, but this one is a special treasure.  It's the completion of a continent-wide tour across the United State.  McPhee escorts a succession of geologists who have explained to him why the theory of continental drift requires revision.  The modifiers are local geological conditions, each region telling its own tale of lithic activity.  In California, the story becomes almost bizarre.  John McPhee might well be considered the only writer of science who could present the story in understandable fashion.  Perhaps, but he would counter that in Eldridge Moores, he enjoyed a tutor of exceptional value to guide him.<br />The idea of plate tectonics was a revolution in viewing the earth.  Previous thinking was nearly all limited to regional, often arcane, activity.  Plate tectonics was the first truly global image of the planet's workings.  It was elegant, universal, and it explained so much, so well, that fitting it to conditions was almost simple.  Plates move, crunch one another, raise mountains, often with spewing volcanoes, and end their career by sinking below the crust.  Look at a map of California [easy to do, since there's one at the front of the book].  It all seems so manifestly organized.  Parallel mountain ranges running north-south, separated by logically placed valleys.  But the Sierra Nevada stands in lofty majesty compared to the Coast Range standing west across the Great Valley.  It shouldn't.<br />According to Moores, that's symptomatic.  By plate tectonics' definition, it should be the Coast Range that should rising in reaction to the pressure of the continental movement.  And why is the Great Valley so wide if a whole continent is trying to crowd the Sierra Nevada west?  Moores suggests that it's because the real western boundary of the North American Plate is around Salt Lake City.  The Mormon capital as a Monterey or Santa Barbara requires some reflective thinking, but Moores knows how to read the rocks.  And McPhee knows how to tell us what he sees.<br />What Moores sees could be compared to a geologic highway accident where a string of vehicles reduce order to chaos.  Plate tectonics is too simple because it fails to take into account wandering island chains.  These are micro-continents with a wanderlust.  Moores sees the likelihood of three island chains pranging the West Coast at different times.  Each time, instead of being pushed aside by the mass of the North American Plate, they simply attached themselves like limpets.  The extra pressure and mass pushed up the High Sierras and the Coast Range.  Positioning, erosion and subsidence left the Great Valley, one of the flattest places in the United States, but rich with alluvial soil.  The soil produces the world's best wine grapes, and McPhee and Moores justifiably pause in the Sonoma Valley.<br />McPhee moves from Moores' analysis of mountain building to the study of earthquakes and fault lines in the Golden State.  Moores' view of California's disorganization is reinforced by the many directions faults take around the state.  Garlock, Hayward, White Wolf are names that impinge on the notoriety of San Andreas.  San Andreas, for all its fame, is not a fault, but a melange of fault structures, due to those impinging island arcs.  McPhee's timing was fortuitous.  As he was preparing the text, the earth was preparing a fitting conclusion to his story.  In October of 1989 the earth moved and presented &quot;an invoice of six billion dollars for a few moments of shaking.&quot;  McPhee, like a diarist recording a life, follows the 'quake from its origins through the state.  It's more compelling reading than any mystery novel.  Wherever you live, you will come away from this book with an enlightened view of what the earth can tell you.

Our view of life is usually pretty limited.  Seeing trees, the family dog, winging birds, ourselves, we forget, if we ever knew, that complex life forms are in the historical and numerical minority.  Even after 3 thousand million years, single-celled animals have the longest duration and largest population.  Globs of material with a string of molecules, which we call \\"bacteria\\" were and are the most common form of life.  Mark Ridley traces how those simple creatures underwent a radical change.  They became restructured in a revolutionary step that would enable highly complex life to exist and evolve.  Part of that revolution was the development of the most absurd concept in life's long history - sex.  Gregor Mendel investigated the passing on of traits by counting peas.  Ridley introduces an avatar, \\"Mendel's Demon\\" to explain how sex regulates what is passed on in us.<br />In this superbly written account, Ridley clearly explains the advantage sex has in the evolution of life.  He uses the children's game of Chinese Whispers [called Gossip in my childhood] to explain how evolution operates.  In Gossip [forgive the chauvinism], a group of children whisper a message from one to another.  Record the original message \\"when the tiger comes, freeze.\\"  Compare it with the version expressed by the final child.  There will certainly be changes.  In almost all occurrences, the errors are in misunderstood whole words, not just letters - \\"freeze\\" becomes \\"wheeze.\\"  The \\"words\\" of life are our genes.  Acting as instructions to forming a new individual, the message must be clear enough to build the organism.  That organism must survive to produce another.  Sex provides ways of assessing the message to assure its validity before generating an offspring.<br />Ridley goes on to discuss how complex life forms emerged.  The most important steps were the protecting of DNA in a cell nucleus and the addition of mitochondria.  Mitochondria are the energy modules of cells - chloroplasts in plants probably being the best known.  Their joining the nuclear cell provided a trade-off.  Mitochondria were given a place to live, paying rent by transferring much of their DNA to the cell's nuclear version.  Once these two changes had been achieved, sex evolved with mechanisms to overcome the problems of DNA playing Gossip.  Ridley shows how the processes surrounding sex overcome the mistakes that inevitably occur in the copying process.  Gross errors don't survive - indeed they rarely achieve the development level of a fetus. The apparent dichotomy here is that while reducing errors may mean conserving an organism's traits, it may also reduce the diversity necessary to survive in a changing environment.  The balance is delicate, as the fact that 99.9 per cent of all species having gone extinct over time testifies.<br />Ridley sensibly brings each detailed description of the cell's processes back to how it relates to humans.  This ploy is highly successful in making the book readable and focussed.  It also builds a framework for the concluding chapters.  After his thorough analysis of the procedures of reproduction and evolution, Ridley goes on to some highly speculative notions about the future.  He notes that our species carries more genetic errors across generations than any other species.  Could this error rate lead to what he calls \\"mutational meltdown\\"?  Possibly, but not likely.  Having speculated on conditions of life on alien worlds, he uses those ideas to suggest future scenarios to prevent that \\"meltdown.\\"  That bugaboo of today's society, cloning, Ridley dismisses as too vulnerable to natural selection.  Instead, he sees gradually improving methods in using genes for therapy, organ replacement or repair, possibly even a drastic change in gender identity.<br />Ridley's almost anecdotal style makes this overview of a complex topic an absorbing read.  Reaching from deep history to a plausible future he covers much ground.  His imagery retains your attention and he carefully builds your knowledge as you follow his lead.  He's also careful with his science.  No assertions are put forward without good foundation, and where the evidence is lacking or slim, he cautions us about coming to conclusions.  The balance is so carefully maintained that this book might be considered a call for research in particular areas.  Formidable and challenging, this is a delightful book for countless reasons.  Intriguing questions, bold but realistic speculation, sound science vividly presented.  A rich treasure, this book will be valuable until all Ridley's questions are resolved.<br />Note to those who have found the title a problem, be aware that this book was originally published as: Mendel's Demon: Gene Justice and the Complexity of Life.

It would find a ready market in university science departments.  This finest of American essayists produced a series of exemplary books on how North America came to be.  His journeys gleaning the information he provides us, traversed the continent, chiefly along an Interstate highway, examining roadcuts, adjacent outcrops and surrounding mountains.  His guides were America's foremost geologists, their work often hiding them from the public gaze.  McPhee brings them into view, relating their work, their personalities, their accomplishment through unmatched descriptive prose.<br />In this book, McPhee teams up with geologist Anita Harris in touring the eastern mountains of North America from the coast to the southern shores of the Great Lakes.  The journey is far more than the examination and cataloging of rocks.  McPhee has elsewhere expressed his sense of history with peerless ability.  Here, he extends history to deep time as he and Harris examine the formation of the Appalachian Mountain chains.  The lithic record, as might be imagined, is hardly clear-cut.  Rock formations are jumbled, twisted, folded over in a confusing testimony to the Earth's action in forming continents.  McPhee, in the beginning, is as confused as the rocks - and the reader.  Harris, with admirable patience, explains the rocks and what they express, helping McPhee, and us, to see their history.  &quot;I haven't worked at this level since I don't know when,&quot; she says of his novice status.  Her knowledge and his prose skills manage to advance our knowledge painlessly.  The rocks, however, daunt their efforts to paint a uncomplicated picture.<br />When the idea of plate tectonics emerged in the 1960s, McPhee explains, it was a revolutionary view of our planet.  Replacing the older &quot;drying, wrinkling apple&quot; scenario, plate tectonics provided an elegant, sweeping picture of continental forming.  Within a decade, the North American Plate, the Pacific Plate, the Eurasian Plate took places in the niches of our memories.  Schools quickly adopted the new science, supported by expressively illustrated textbooks.  &quot;Continental drift&quot; became a &quot;buzzword&quot; in jokes, advertising, and other memetic devices.  To Anita Harris, this ready acceptance blinded even geologists to the truly complex record of the area she dubs &quot;suspect terrain.&quot;  Through McPhee she shows us that &quot;a given place will have been at one time below fresh water, at another under brine, will have been mountainous country, a quiet plain, an equatorial desert, an arctic coast, a coal swamp, and a river delta - all in one ZIP Code.&quot;  All this activity, no matter how anciently derived, requires explanation.  Harris reminds him that &quot;geology&quot; is derived from Gaea, the daughter of Chaos.  Recounting the source of Appalachian land forms remains an unfulfilled task.<br />Along with continental movement are the vagaries of weather.  Mountain building is always associated with erosion, McPhee reminds us.  He goes on to describe the effects of the greatest eroder of them all, the three kilometre thick ice sheets that pushed Canadian diamonds into Indiana.  Along with gemstones, the glaciers bore a cargo of rocks and soil acquired in their journey southward.  The &quot;suspect terrain&quot; this bears marks of ice, volcanic activity, unexplained mountain building and oceanic advances and retreats.  It may not be a pretty picture, but in McPhee's descriptive hand, its fascination is endless.  For learning geology or simply to bask in superior writing skills, this book is outdone by only one means - more John McPhee.a decade, the North American Plate, the Pacific Plate, the Eurasian Plate took places in the niches of our memories.

The quest to understand the role of humanity in Nature will be ongoing for some time to come.  Edward Wilson's synthesis tells us why the study of human evolution should be pursued to its fullest extent.  Discussing the roots of human behaviour and why we need to study them in greater depth, Wilson's book is an appeal for extensive research and comparative analysis.<br />Wilson's literary and scientific skills are brought fully to light as he takes us through the universals of human behaviour.  He addresses the topics of heredity, aggression, religion, altruism and other aspects of what we are in nature.  He isn't constricted to simply delineating where we came from, he sees the entire exercise as providing guideposts for our future existence.  As he argues, \\"The only way forward is to study human nature as part of the natural sciences, in an attempt to integrate the natural sciences with the social sciences and humanities.\\"<br />At the outset, he acknowledges how formidable his proposed task is for those who will likely be effected by it.  Sociology, anthropology, psychology are all well-established disciplines that will be discomforted by what he's proposing.  As the concluding book in his trilogy to build a definition of the science of sociobiology, he's already suffered reaction to his ideas.  Wilson, however, is seeking construction, not dissolution.  A new field of study on human behaviour can only be achieved by a merger of the established research areas.  He knows that the study of humans is almost a divine mandate in the eyes of its practitioners.  They have already contended that there isn't enough data to build a new science.  He acknowledges that existing evidence is scanty, but suggests that our ignorance is the fullest reason to pursue the work.  We mustn't be constrained by those who argue against the existence of our natural roots. With admirable foresight he anticipates his later critics.  As he puts it, \\". . . no intellectual vice is more crippling than defiantly self-indulgent anthropocentrism.\\"<br />His final chapter, Hope, is his message about the future.  Having examined religion as a human universal, he notes its failures through splintering and conflicts.  Objects of worship have shifted from the divine to the philosophic.  \\"Visionaries and revolutionaries set out to change the system\\" which has proven too arbitrary and absolutist.  \\"Human nature,\\" he stresses, is the \\"potential array\\" that can be applied by knowledgeable societies to consciously design a better future than appears likely now.  The principal task is to measure biological constraints on decision making, to understand them and apply cultural evolution to biological evolution to create a \\"biology of ethics.\\"  The result, Wilson argues, will be a \\"more deeply understood and enduring code of moral values.\\"<br />These are challenging concepts, requiring serious, dedicated effort.  Wilson recognizes that old mythologies, particularly \\"self-indulgent anthropocentrism,\\" must be swept away.  A new and better mythology, the evolutionary epic, will emerge.  It will be forged from the biological and social sciences, thereby forcing honesty and reject dogma.  He paints an appealing image for scholars and researchers to consider.  Many have done so, but die-hards remain entrenched.  Those who will benefit the most from his ideas are those who avoid heeding the \\"small number of [those] who are committed to the view that human behaviour arises from a very few unstructured drives.\\"  In other words, avoid the false spectre of \\"genetic determinism\\" raised by Wilson's critics and read him directly.  There are many rewards in this book and it deserves careful attention.  It deserves a place on your shelf to help you along your path to a valid future, untrammeled by false mythologies or barran reasoning.. . . no intellectual vice is more crippling than defiantly self-indulgent anthropocentrism.\\"<br />His final chapter, Hope, is his message about the future.

The former wishes to entice you to visit the places he's seen - indeed, he's generally paid to accomplish that end.  The travel journal is often a pure record of sights, events, people encountered.  It is also an honest record of what is experienced.  Bill Bryson writes journals of his travels.  His accounts are forthright, often with scathing wit, but devoid of malice, even when deeply critical of their subjects.  In this book, mainly a walking tour of England, Wales and Scotland, he writes a valedictory to his years in Britain.  A delightful read, Notes provides rich entertainment with a serious look at the current British scene.<br />Bryson deserves full marks for courage.  He walks.  He covers vast distances in weather that would dismay a seasoned fisherman.  He risks his life along wind-blown cliffs, looking down for surf lost in driven fog or slashing rain.  No-one wet, cold and hungry can maintain their humour long.  Bryson conveys his feelings with honest vigour, but veneers his stress with vivid descriptions of the environment he traverses.  He struggles to make sense of British Rail [something even the natives have abandoned hope of achieving], more than once falling back on irregular bus services.  He suffers a day's dogleg travel to cover a twenty mile distance because no connecting line exists.  Still, he persists and is often enough rewarded to make the effort worth the time.  And his descriptions of these events rewards the reader through sharing his reactions yet not pointing an accusatory finger.  It's \\"the system\\" that's at fault.<br />As an American from Iowa, Bryson may be relied on to take a detached view of Britain.  He's no royalist, but he has a strong affinity for the traditional.  He admires old buildings and wants money spent to keep them intact.  He grieves volubly over the supplanting of \\"heritage\\" buildings by modern steel and glass monuments to capitalism and modernity.  In this vein, perhaps the best chapter is on Oxford - the town and the uni.  He virtually takes you by the hand, leading you about the town, up one charming street or along \\"some forgotten lane.\\"  Regrettably, you emerge in a desolate square swamped by parked cars.  Grungy shopping centres abound, and he [and you] find little refuge unless you choose the right pub.  His anguished cry for Oxford, \\" . . . there is so much that is so wrong.  How did it happen?\\" is<br />repeated throughout the book as variations on a theme.<br />His tour completed, he returns to his family in preparation for a return to America [he's now in New Hampshire - not Iowa - a telling point].  His British home in Yorkshire seems unsurprising in view of his travails in the South.  He likes the North's warm-heartedness, although he admits it is manifested only over a long duration.  He adores the scenery, but has never had to make a living from that land.  His favourite town names are Northern ones and he'll leave with more than mild regret.  Yet, at the end of this book, as he declares his bliss at returning to Yorkshire, one cannot but wonder whether the long journey was worth the effort [other than to produce the book].  Because this book is a journal of a pilgrimage, it fails to entice the reader to duplicate it.  Bryson's superb wit and descriptive powers hold you to his side as he journeys.

The terms \\"voodoo\\" and \\"zombie,\\" so ignorantly applied in our culture over the years, are clarified by this serious scholar.  Davis offers much more than simply a redefinition of what media has distorted.  He examines the origins and use of various toxins that are applied to put a living person in a death-like trance.  This seemingly \\"evil\\" practice has deep and positive social roots.  It's the social milieu that ultimately gives this book its real value.  As Davis pursues botanical sources used in rendering people comatose, he is caught up in an investigation of why the drugs are used on particular individuals.<br />Davis' quest began with a commission to investigate anesthetic drugs from plants and animals.  His mentor, Richard Schultes, was considered the founder of ethnobotany, the study of plant chemistry as a cultural artifact.  Davis is sent to Haiti in 1982, a time of growing awareness of the numbers of natural products overlooked for medicinal use.  Davis is sent to Haiti to investigate the zombi myths.  He learns of the use of \\"magic powders\\" to bring about a catatonic state.  People are declared dead, buried, but are exhumed and led away, often to a life of near slavery.  Davis, using Schultes' work as background, investigates the Datura genus of plants.  Datura in various species, ranges across the Western Hemisphere and is widely used by Amerindian and other peoples for various rituals.  So, too, are the excretions of Bufo marinus, the Central American \\"cane toad,\\" that today is the scourge of vast reaches of Australia.  Its poison was adapted for various uses in Europe within years of Columbus' voyages.<br />This pharmocopoeia of toxins and anesthetic drugs have been a part of many cultures, but in Haiti, they prove to be a mechanism of social justice.  Wade's account of the structure of Haitian society is worth the price of the book.  The classic picture of hierarchical society, resembling so vividly that of our own, is dissected carefully by Davis.  Haiti, with its history of dictators and oppression, foreign rule and harsh slavery so vividly depicted by North American media, retains a hidden but powerful underlying structure.  While the government seems to sit dominant in Port-au-Prince, in the rural areas an almost independent organization of communities flourish.  These local structures reflect accepted norms, deal with local conflict and provide an underlying enforcement mechanism for the maintenance of social order.  Their foundation is derived from African roots, modified by Roman Catholic ritual, and remain unheralded except by those who decry their secretiveness.  Wade argues these community establishments are not truly \\"secret societies,\\" but instead reflect the needs of people for whom bombastic pronouncements have no place in their daily existence.  The houngans [\\"vodoun priests\\"] are little more than Haitian parsons supporting their local populations.<br />Although focused on Haiti, Davis' book cannot but evoke how much we have yet to learn about other \\"hidden\\" or \\"clandestine\\" societies.  If the method of \\"zombification\\" of malefactors seems extreme in our view, it may be simply because we hide our criminals away in concrete tombs at taxpayer's expense.  Davis explains that no victim of zombification has been selected arbitrarily.  Each situation is carefully examined to assess whether the victim has offended family or the community.  Catatonic drugs are administered to render the culprit to a state where they may be transported from the community they've offended.  To Davis, it's simply the quiet application of justice.  Is this a technique we could apply in our own society?  Probably not, since we don't possess the cultural background.  But the rendering of justice at the local level for local offenses is surely something we might consider as a behavioural innovation.  Davis leaves this question open, but if we engage in the type of investigation he relates, there might be other examples in other societies from which we can learn.  This book offers much information and interesting examples of lives different from our own.ring of justice at the local level for local offenses is surely something we might consider as a behavioural innovation.

Nearly every page confronts you with a new reality.  In some essays you'll have your nose forcibly rubbed in it.  But don't despair, even with some of the grim pictures presented here, nearly all contain some message of hope, as well.  Timothy Ferris has assembled an impressive array of science writing covering topics ranging from quantum physics to the water you drink.  There's something here for everyone, but read them all, new doors may open for your mind.  And, typically with Ferris, he begins the collection in an unexpected way - a poem from John Updike.  Who but Updike could produce sensitive, compelling verse about transparent sea animals?<br />Examining the universe is an overwhelming challenge.  Galaxies, stars, gas clouds, planets - the images appear almost daily.  But what about the stuff we can't see?  Michael Turner, an astronomer with impressive narrative skills, describes his quest for &quot;dark matter,&quot; the mysterious stuff that may be impeding the expansion of the cosmos.  He notes that the &quot;missing mass&quot; often credited with explaining why the universe isn't evolving the way we once thought, is a misnomer: &quot;It's the light, not the mass, that's missing.&quot;  Turner's explanation of what's actually happening will surprise the reader.  In another essay, matter that isn't &quot;dark,&quot; but still is behaving in unexpected ways is explained by Erik Asphaug.  Asteroids, those little worlds cohabiting the solar system with us, are revealing their secret lives.<br />Other lives are revealed here, as well.  Mandrills, a primate of bizarre appearance, also turn out to have a bizarre lifestyle.  Just as we were all growing accustomed to the image of &quot;alpha&quot; males in the baboon and ape worlds, mandrills have evolved a unique feminist society.  In Central Africa, Natalie Angier encountered huge troops of mandrills, all female.  Males are relegated to a mostly &quot;monastic&quot; life - a pattern seen in only one other of the 225 primate species.  Life at a more fundamental level is examined by Stephen Hall's account of stem cell research.<br />Life's condition today and its prospects for tomorrow are the topic of other essays.  Greg Critser presents a grim picture of American eating habits; the &quot;obesity epidemic&quot; sweeping society.  Which Americans are overweight and why?  Critser's analysis offers some unexpected answers.  Health is a concern for any people, and those who seek to restore health are too often unknown and unheralded.  Helen Epstein examines the history of combating AIDS in South Africa where questions of health become interspersed with international economics and local politics.  Health issues at local levels are examined in the most powerful<br />essay in the collection.  Tracy Kidder follows &quot;The Good Doctor&quot; on his rounds.  Paul Farmer's patients, however, are not restricted to a local hospital or clinic.  He travels from Boston to Haiti, Cuba to Peru, even to Siberia as he intently seeks to restore the afflicted to health.  And, incidentally, to petition the affluent for support in his work.  When entreaty fails, he calls on a talent for deviousness a spy would envy.  He's still out there working and he still needs your support.  Find out who he is from this essay and why you should favour his requests.<br />There are too many issues and ideas in this collection to impart them all here.  The quote acting as the title of this review comes from the person in charge of water conservation for the fastest growing metropolis in America - Las Vegas.  Turn to Jacques Leslie's article to learn why that city may well lack water within the next five years.  Your throat may turn dry as you read, but you will hesitate to run to the kitchen for a brimming glassful of water.  Instead, you may find yourself prowling the house to stop any dripping taps.  You can close the taps, but if you readthis magnificent collection of essays, you will be opening your mind.  If you're not afraid of reality and are willing to confront it, buy and enjoy this book.

Extra-Pair Mating is but one of many animal behaviour traits examined by John Alcock in this excellent overview of research in sociobiology.  Many species of birds have been typified as monogamous - pairing for life, or during a mating season.  Alcock cites avian studies that modify that picture.  Red-winged Blackbird females will flit from the nest to take up with a different male although remaining partnered with her original mate.  Alcock stresses that without the research spurred by Edward O. Wilson's 1975 book, Sociobiology, The New Synthesis, we would never have discovered this novel avian behaviour.  He goes on to show even more unexpected traits in birds, such as warblers whose offspring remain in the nest area to assist in supporting the next clutch of hatchlings.  These birds, faced with varying available resources actually possess the means to control the sex of their offspring depending on forecast needs.<br />Don't mistake the title of this book.  \\"Triumph\\" is not a victory celebration, it's a paean to the successful maturing of a young science.  Many of the studies, superbly related in this book, show how much the depth of knowledge has increased since Wilson's appeal.  Alcock shows how sociobiology, instead of being a \\"revolution\\" as many of its critics tag it, is in reality the fulfillment of Darwin's original premise.  Wilson defined the discipline as \\"the systematic study of the biological basis of all social behaviour.\\"  To Alcock, that means seeking the role natural selection played in shaping the evolution of the particular social behaviour under study.  Alcock relates how this foundation has led to inquiries and results rarely or never considered prior to Wilson's call for this type of study.  Nor is the work confined to birds.  Insects, spiders, mountain goats, chimpanzees and other animal life are covered.  Nor are the botanists overlooked - plant reproductive strategies are also examined.  The key phrase throughout is \\"adaptation\\" and its role in evolution.  Anyone wishing to gain insight into the way life adapts to conditions will find this book a priceless treasure.<br />Alcock must spend time dealing with the critics of sociobiology because they have reached such a broad public audience.  Gould's pernicious attacks are a particular concern of Alcock's since the Harvard paleontologist's adroit turn of phrase has deceived many unwary readers.  Gould's mantle as \\"the pope of paleontology\\" has allowed him to characterize studies of adaptation as expressions of \\"Darwinian fundamentalism.\\"  This oft-repeated phrase, plus his characterization of \\"just so stories\\" to studies he disapproves of, have made the lot of several young researchers difficult.  Alcock recounts one case in which an admittedly tentative field study was the target of Gould's vituperation.  The long career of Gould's irrational attacks on sociobiology are analysed, then gently dismembered by Alcock.  If for no other reason, this book should achieve wide circulation for its service in exposing the fallacies of Wilson's critics.<br />However, this book has far more value than puncturing \\"punctuationists.\\"  Alcock shows that sociobiology isn't the \\"gene determinist\\" science it's been labeled.  The many studies cited in this book remove the idea that only humans are flexible in the decision-making process.  Extending our evolutionary roots as Alcock's many examples do, leads him in to see sociobiology as the basis for many practical human social issues.  The diamond in this tiara of evolutionary roots for social behaviour is the application of the research to the future human condition.  His chapter on \\"practical applications of sociobiology\\" nearly justifies the price of the book in itself.  With no illusions about immediate success given the ongoing squalls of opposition by such as Gould, Alcock still suggests reasoned, pragmatic solutions for social issues derived from sociobiological research.  Instead ofjousting with the opposition, Alcock says \\"let's try this or that solution and see if we achieve positive results.\\"  What better example of adaptation?<br />Alcock's citation method is novel, but one which we can only hope more writers will follow.  Instead of a duality of footnotes and bibliography, Alcock simply lists his sources alphabetically.  Assigning each author a corresponding number, he then inserts the number in the main text.  The reader avoids the distraction of footnote references, the bibliography is a ready reference back to the text and the size of the book is reduced - saves paper.  Of far greater novelty and function, however, is the appendix of this excellent work.  Where other authors use an appendix to flesh out arcane topics for the dedicated student, Alcock, again, is more practical.  His appendix is a study guide, complete with thought-provoking questions.  It's a crafty tool for reconsidering your own ideas and expand your thinking.<br />NOTE:  Alcock devotes much attention in this book to mating strategies.  One such strategy, outside his scope, is matching compatible books.  Where Alcock has given us a splendid picture of sociobiology research, another work on the people involved should be mated with TRIUMPH on your shelves.  Ullica Segerstrale's DEFENDERS OF THE TRUTH is an in-depth study of Wilson and his critics.  Both are valuable contributions in understanding the workings and workers in science.of jousting with the opposition, Alcock says \\"let's try this or that solution and see if we achieve positive results.\\"  What better example of adaptation?<br />Alcock's citation method is novel, but one which we can only hope more writers will follow.

Miles' portrayal depicted a god learning the role.  He's inconsistent, breaks promises, commits genocide and grows increasingly dictatorial.  At one point, a single man challenges him, winning a moral victory which clearly disturbs this irrational spirit.  Finally, like an elderly curmudgeon, the deity simply withdraws from those he wishes to worship him.<br />According to Miles, after a long span of time the god has learned remorse.  He has subjected his followers to a succession of invasions and dispersals.  Israel becomes a client state of the Assyrians, Babylon, Greece, and now, Rome.  As with many aged, powerful men, the god has reflected on his own actions and decided some positive actions are in order.  He doesn't consider his career a failure, but discerns humanity's course isn't following its destined path.  Genocide and other manifestations of his power are no longer the answer.  A new course is necessary, so he becomes the Incarnation - a deity housed in a human body.<br />Miles portrayal of Christ's life shows how poorly this deity understands his creation.  After all, as a god with neither peers nor serious challengers, he fails to understand human characteristics.  Throughout the account, Christ is ambivalent in his assigned role.  He shifts from expressing his divinity to being but a man, confused and perplexed by the role forced on him.  He doesn't question his fate, knowing, at least in his adult life, that he is to be sacrificed.  He understands the need for his role, but anticipates the pain as any of us would.<br />Miles relates how uncertainty leads to ambivalence in the behaviour of this Incarnation.  Repelling followers at first, he begins gathering adherents, but, they too, are confused.  Mostly Jews, his recruits think his mission is to restore Israel as promised.  When they fail to understand his claim to a wider mission, they fail to comprehend.  How can this \\"messiah\\" claim to redeem Israel when he offers succor to strangers and enemies?  When he dies in such squalid circumstances, a social criminal, the distress among his followers is intense.  Miles notes the significance of such a death, describing it as \\"a huge and horrifying surprise\\".  Christ has not imparted his knowledge of the finale, leaving his followers confused and adrift.  Even the resurrection seems hardly worthy of notice.  There's no grandeur, no powerful declarations, little drama.  The meaning of it all must be derived over time until the deity's original intention can be imparted to others.  The result is not the god's accomplishment, but the people who had faith in the idea and imparted it to others.<br />Miles' account is full of inconsistencies and elf-contradictions.  These are not author's faults, however, resulting instead from the material he consults and brings to our view.  The Incarnation is as inconsistent as his \\"father,\\" which isn't surprising given his previous career.  Christ asserts the teachings of the Prophets foretell his coming, yet the god Miles portrays seems to know nothing of \\"love\\" in those days, particularly love of all humanity.  The god's focus, promises and failures, are for Israel alone.  How then, does this deity in its human incarnation, expect anyone to believe his new identity?  Miles concludes that the act of sacrifice is self-explanatory needing no further elaboration.<br />Miles postscripts the story with a literary analysis of its telling.  One interesting facet is the Bible's use of irony.  Irony uses or \\"double meaning, or reversal of meaning. . .  and will not stoop to explanation.\\"  He suggests that in this case, long-standing practices are suddenly reversed, then there is a place for irony in religion.  He admits to the novelty of the concept, but argues that it fits the Judeo-Christian story.  It's a compelling and challenging idea, but then, so is this book.omprehend.

As he transports two men 65 million years into the past, he offers us a sampling of everything from the anthropic principle through geology to zoology.  He's able to reconcile the paradoxes raised by time travel [including a nod to the most famous example, Ray Bradbury's \\"The Sound of Thunder\\"] and set them aside plausibly.  Sawyer also illuminates the contribution of Canada's researchers in nearly all these disciplines with subdued fervour.  And scourges politicians for their failure to support science.  All this in just over two hundred pages is no small feat.<br />The theme of End of an Era recounts the probable cause of the dinosaurs' extinction.  Sawyer uses the story to review the thinking resulting from the Alvarez proposal that a wandering asteroid so disrupted the environment that all the large sauropods died out, leaving the planet an open niche for mammalian life.  If an asteroid didn't kill off the dinosaurs, what did?  The most discussed option is an era of massive vulcanism which would have the same effect.  But Sawyer, with his gift of imagination, introduces a new option.  Again, his concept has a sound scientific base and he describes it at some length.  His  presentation is impressive and well delivered.  And a terrifying surprise.<br />Along with his scientific foundation, Sawyer paints realistic characters.  The protagonist is a paleontologist with the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto [Sawyer's lucky, he lives close to his sources], and one can't help but wonder who the model might be.  Brandon Thackeray, in the midst of devastating mid-life crises, is chosen as one of the two time travellers.  His team-mate couldn't have been a worse choice for such an assignment - he's taken up with Brandon's ex-wife.  Miles Jordan might be forgiven that affair, but will never live down taking packages of Twinkies into the Cretaceous.  Sawyer hints that Tory cutbacks have eliminated psychological testing for this unique journey, but still, this is some pair to cram together in a time machine.<br />Sawyer's thinking challenges any reader unfamiliar with the science he introduces.  His brief scenarios of research and theories cover much territory in a restricted space.  While welcome and necessary, they don't leave enough room for plot in such a short book.  Regrettably, his very skills in offering science force the story line over a bumpy path.  There are parallel story lines in this book which take some unravelling.  While his characters are realistically portrayed, the book might have been fleshed out a bit.  Readers of Sawyer's other work know he's fully capable of expanding his persona.  With a shade more depth, this book could have become a classic in speculative [\\"science\\"] fiction instead of just a very good read.  Even if Sawyer's not at the top of his form here, his innovative thinking<br />remains captivating to the discerning reader.gical testing for this unique journey, but still, this is some pair to cram together in a time machine.  <br />Sawyer's thinking challenges any reader unfamiliar with the science he introduces.

For years he's struggled to enlighten us on our place in Nature.  His building is a market where Nature's bounty and wonders are displayed.  If we shop carefully, these goods will continue to be supplied.  We must learn to read the labels with care and use what we take wisely.  This collection of essays is part of the learning process.  Reading them, one is struck by Wilson's expertise in choice.  The writing is good, the subjects are worth your attention and you may come away better understanding how to browse in Nature's shop.  Although the title of this book is something of a misnomer - it would be better labelled &quot;science and society&quot; - the compilation is enlightening in many respects.<br />The essays most directly related to society's concerns cover expanded roles for mathematical concepts, the emotional question of abortion, how we impact wild lands and how technology works to change our lives.  David Berlinski offers a description of a mathematical artifact, the algorithm and how it affects our lives.  A simple, repeatable instruction, the algorithm is now recognized as fundamental in both Nature and human culture.<br />Humanity's relation with Nature comprises most of the remainder of the essays.  Human settlement of wild land is an topic of growing importance.  Mark Cherrington's essay on this contentious issue in Israel might be duplicated in many parts of the planet.  Bernd Heinrich describes the Endurance Predator, the animal whose unusual gait allowed it to occupy the whole planet.  Human walking and running are unique in Nature.  We test our abilities in these unusual capacities with games, and Heinrich speculates on how far those tests can take us.  As we come to understand how Nature works in better detail, the impact on our cultures will be reflected in law, as well as the scientific world.  Gregg Easterbrooke and Malcolm Gladwell describe new understanding of newborns and the unborn.  How should the law be changed to reflect what has been learned about embryos and children?<br />What of adults and the natural world?  Jerome Groopman provides a view of an unusual, but widespread human disorder, The Doubting Disease.  Do you suffer from it?  Our future health in many areas will be impacted by what we learn of our genetic base.  Craig Venter, former president of human genome mapping firm, Celera, is portrayed in depth by Richard Preston.<br />No collection of writings on Nature would be complete without David Quammen.  Here, he takes us along on his jaunt with Michael Fay as the scientist surveys the conditions in central Africa.  Quammen's' ability to bring the reader into his adventures is unsurpassed.  On this trek you share both his enthusiasms and painful experiences through his captivating prose.  He adroitly captures the mood of the field scientist.<br />Regrettably, we can't say as much about the essay on Costa Rican macaws.  While Barbara Kingsolver and Steven Hopp had a pleasant, interesting jaunt in the Central American jungles, the inclusion of this account in this collection seems almost far-fetched.  It's a well-written story, but only sparsely appropriate here.

Critics, commentators, writers [and theologians?] assert that fiction reflects life.  If so, you will look long and hard to find a grander image of life than Daniel Quinn offers in Ishmael.  He isn't interested in building synthetic characters or weaving intricate plots.  He has a message to convey to every human on this planet.  If fiction reaches more people than plain instructive writing, then that's the path he's chosen.  And he's chosen well, providing a vivid scenario of human thinking on how we view life.  How we view life depends on our role - Ishmael divides humanity into two populations, the Leavers and the Takers.<br />Would you answer the newspaper advert seeking a pupil who desires to save the world?  Note the singular - not &quot;pupils&quot; or students.&quot;  Just one.  Are you the one?  As you read this stunning fantasy it's impossible not to place yourself in the teller's mind as he confronts a massive lowland gorilla.  Ishmael is the teacher seeking a student because he has a question: &quot;With man gone, will there be hope for the gorilla?&quot;  Keep this question in mind.  As you follow Ishmael's &quot;course&quot; you will gain fresh insight into what he considers the fundamental question:  &quot;how did things come to be this way?&quot;  Ishmael is no pedantic scholar or medieval disputant.  He coaxes, teases, almost seduces response, but your answers must be carefully thought through before offering them.  He's asking that you search the roots of your own cultural heritage to form your reply.  Before long the perceptive reader will pause before simply accepting the author's responses.  Quinn's aim, after all, is elicit reaction from you - his fictional &quot;student&quot; is only a mechanism to that end.<br />In his dialogue with his pupil [you!], Ishmael repeats the question of &quot;how things came to be this way.&quot;  As you ponder his question, think about the figures dominating our heritage.  Ishmael names Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad and others as &quot;Prophets&quot; - the key figures in Taker history.  What have they taught us about the world we inhabit?  Who are the Leavers' prophets and what are their teachings?  Ishmael's response will surprise many.<br />Quinn's building dialogue throughout this book is skillfully presented.  His innovative style is straightforward, unpretentious and nearly flawless.  It would be easy to criticise his prose as &quot;too simple,&quot; but the urgency of his message and the novel form of its presentation is purposely designed to attract the widest possible audience.  The story may not be complex or convoluted, but Quinn has given us a gem.  Remember, diamonds are composed of but one element - anything added is impurity.<br />Ishmael's &quot;course&quot; pre-requisite is &quot;an earnest desire to save the world.&quot;  No-one can question the enormity of that task, least of all Ishmael himself.

A passionate narrative, supported by a wealth of material, he ensures the pejorative \\"dark continent\\" will never again be uttered by his readers.  Far too many of us have allowed years of ignorant press to cloud our perception of the continent of our origins.  Reading this book provides a new base of knowledge about the continent giving us birth.<br />\\"Base\\" suggests Reader's starting point, which opens with a description of the cratons forming Africa, the world's oldest bedrock.  Rocks alone don't make a continent, and Reader continues with a discussion of how Africa's climate has been instrumental in guiding many aspects of Africa's development.  The issue of rainfall or lack of it, its impact on river courses and lake formation are brought to bear as the story progresses.  Reader goes on to describe the rise of life in Africa,  most significantly, of course, the emergence of humans.  His use of science is impressive, clearly the result of extensive and careful research.<br />From human beginnings he moves to the development of African civilizations.  For years Egypt dominated western thinking in the equation of Africa and society.  Reader's takes us through the societies that emerged apart from Egypt.  He describes societies that developed in sub-Saharan Africa and how circumstances vary with location.  That Africa set examples for later communal development is frequently overlooked, and he describes representative societies that developed in Africa.  The Niger Delta and Aksum, two of the communities, one agricultural and the other a commercial centre, are samples of successful human organization in Africa.  Clearly, the tradition of scattered tribes with garden farms supporting chancy hunting as the typical African condition is false and misleading.<br />Reader's chapters on slavery and the slave trade are enlightening.  The Western Hemisphere remains self-congratulatory on the extinction of slavery, even though it took a war to accomplish it.  Reader makes clear that the impact of the slavery endured into modern times, and the social consequences are both intense and widespread.  Raiders and victims persisted for decades, and today's political clashes have roots in the slave trade.  If we are to comprehend the African scene, Reader reminds us, we can start with a firmer knowledge of slavery's impact than our media has given us.<br />Reader's account of modern nation building in Africa is captivating reading.  One glaring fact emerges - Africa has more national borders than any other continent.  This artifact of colonization should be a starting point of any course on the continent.  Reader notes that 177 \\"ethnic cultural areas\\" are crossed by these artificial boundaries, with predictable results.  Uncertainties, lack of communication with urban centres, and rivalries all contribute to the failure of European and North American policy-makers to properly formulate responses to<br />African \\"national\\" conditions.<br />The scope of Reader's portrayal of Africa is too broad to allow a detailed account of modern events.  This book being a \\"Biography of the Continent\\" and not a \\"current events\\" report precludes deep analysis of contemporary affairs.  The fascinating life of Idi Amin, for example, is omitted entirely from Reader's roll call of African figures.

Each newly discovered fossil is scrupulously assessed for its place on the human family tree.  Locating it properly is fundamental in understanding how evolution achieved Homo sapiens.  Tattersall and Schwarz conduct us on a tour of the history of evolutionary thinking and detail the analysis procedures.  The expedition is thoughtfully conceived, offering superb vistas and rewarding discoveries.<br />Over half a century ago, E. Mayr and T. Dobzhansky developed a \\"grand synthesis\\" of human evolution.  According to the authors, the earlier workers postulated a \\"linear\\" path of hominid evolution.  This analysis forged much of evolutionary thinking for decades.  Dissenters, however, were always present.  Nearly every book on human evolution  spends some time describing the conflict between the \\"lumpers\\" and the \\"splitters\\".  Viewing the many of the hominid fossils as but individual variations of general types, the lumpers find abhorrent the complexity resulting from too many species.  To them, the family tree is a linear trunk with but a few branches.  In contrast, the splitters see fossil variations reflecting a host of unearthed new hominid species.  They feel that turning the human family tree into a frizzy bush gives the emergence of Homo sapiens an even more unique place in Nature than it already enjoys.<br />Tattersall and Schwarz produce a remarkable case for additional splitting.  Morphology, the classifying of characteristics of anatomical features, is their operating system.  In this book we are offered one of the most complete morphological analyses of human fossils in print.  Dismissing the idea of the human family tree portraying a linear sequence of events, they examine in minute detail the bones unearthed to date.  Eyebrow ridges, chin sutures and cheek form are critically reassessed in building their case.  Homo erectus, once considered a world girdling precursor to modern humanity, demands reconsideration, according to the authors.<br />The text of this book might prove a bit daunting to newcomers to anthropology or anatomy.  Rest assured, however, that this book will reward any reader with but minimal perseverance.  You may need to engage in a bit of page flipping in understanding some points.  The lavish illustrations on those pages will reward the curious; photographs and drawings clarifying what might seem obscure or unfamiliar.  Indeed, this is one of the first popular books illustrating areas often remanded to text in other general books on this topic.  The authors deserve the fullest accolades for their efforts in providing intelligible text and graphics.  Their concluding presentation of a new family tree for human ancestors is an excellent summation of their assertions.<br />The authors spend an unexpected amount of ink dwelling on the idea that Neanderthal is not a member of Homo sapiens.  It's difficult to understand why they feel the need to flog this so severely, since this concept has been out of mainstream paleoanthropology for some time.  Since they fail to identify the target of their sniping, when so many others holding contrary views are disposed of elsewhere, we're at a loss to comprehend their vehemence.  The assumption follows that since this is an area of Tattersall's expertise, he's simply taken this opportunity to caper a little.  Since the explanation is so clear and accompanied by such magnificent illustrative material, we may forgive them a bit of prancing and enjoy the performance.<br />While the authors build a convincing case, it abides on a shaky foundation.  In seeking support for new hominid species, the omit a definition of speciation.  Species are organisms that reproduce successfully.  Yet within any complex species, wide variations exist to trap the morphologist.  A glance at any kennel with display a wide variation in bones, hair covering and colour, but the inmates remain dogs.  While they argue that geographicdistribution contributes to speciation [which it does], there's simply no evidence that the human diaspora generated new species.  Quite the reverse in modern humans.  From this, it seems their<br />assault on Mayr and Dobzhansky's thesis seems misplaced.  No matter how many variations on the theme occur in the fossil record, the lineage of humanity does follow a path into the distant past.  As Darwin grieved, the fossil record remains too sparse to trace that path in detail at this time.<br />Their omission of defining speciation detracts but little from the value of this book.  The detailed information and the quality illustrative material makes it a rich addition to the library of anyone delving into the mysteries of human evolution.  It's a costly addition, but well worth the investment to those concerned with learning their place in Nature.  Their case may be flawed, but their evidence and how they present it is worthwhile.ic distribution contributes to speciation [which it does], there's simply no evidence that the human diaspora generated new species.

The trains look pretty much the same.  The tracks, starting with a single line, branch out but remain parallel; they all seem to be going to the same place.  The commuters vary little in appearance but are striking in that they spend all their time scribbling.  As the trains move along they encounter sharp curves, at which point the commuters exchange their scribblings.  After a moment of reflection, they begin scribbling again.  It's a bizarre picture, but the absurdity of the scene in no way invalidates Armstrong's thesis.  The three monotheistic religions follow parallel courses in attempting to define their god.  Thinkers over the generations seek a relation for humanity with the god, but that position varies with the circumstances of history.  Each definition of god becomes common, but at differing times and conditions.<br />Armstrong's most significant statement appears near the end when she reminds us that gods seem to be a necessary part of the human condition.  What else could explain the wealth of prose she recounts in her study of the human quest to define the god of the Jews, Christians and Muslims?  With impressive research, she charts four millennia of the human quest to define the god of these faiths.  Although varying with time and place, the theme remains constant:  could the god be defined, and what was its relationship with humanity?  That the task remains unfulfilled is a testimony to the human need to resolve it.  Armstrong questions neither the validity of the quest, nor the solutions offered over that long span of time.  She does, however, provide an excellent summation of who participated in the search and why their solutions usually reflected social conditions, not divine inspiration.<br />Armstrong starts with the Jews' desire to define their deity.  The Jews have traditionally been credited with bringing monotheism to the Western world.  One deity, however, doesn't make for common thinking.  Over the centuries, Jewish thinkers have proposed many roles for their god.  The deity has been brought into the community by some thinkers, but thrust away too distant to perceive by others.  This variation of position reflects differing attitudes about the god's powers and intentions.  If the god is closely involved with human affairs, then it is to be credited or blamed for the human condition.  When conditions become severely negative, under oppressive rulers, for example, or the imposition of exile and dispersal, people question the god's compassion or sense of justice.  Armstrong finds thinkers adapting to the conditions by relocating the god to a place distant from human affairs.  Where the deity had been close and familiar, Armstrong shows how it now becomes removed and unknowable.<br />The Jews merely set a pattern of thinking about the god, which would be followed by Christians and Muslims alike.  Armstrong introduces us to the often boisterous debate over the position of their god relative to humanity.  Christ's uncertain origins coupled with the degrading method of his death, complicated the culture of Jewish thought Christians inherited.  If the god was remote, why and how could it manifest as a man?  If it did become human, how could there be three gods when tradition stipulated one?  Armstrong relates that even the compromise of the Nicene Creed didn't resolve this thorny question.<br />Islam resolved that issue by rejecting divinity in Christ.  Armstrong's description of the growth of Islam is a fine summation.  She recounts how the Muslims faced exactly the question plaguing the Jews: what was the god, and how did it relate to humanity?  The answers were identical, as well.  The only differences lay in the causes.  In the Jews it was usually forced by external events such as invasion.  In Islam, the issues forcing the question were internal - corrupt or oppressive leaders and social injustice.  Islam's Qur'an, Armstrong stresses, is best read in the original Arabic.  With its message of justice and compassion, social inequities led to movements demanding a return to its original tenets.  Again, however, the question of the god's definition remains perplexing.  Social injustice led to the god's unknowability and Armstrong portrays the thinkers struggling to absolve it from permitting injustice.  If divine restitution is not likely to be forthcoming, it's because the god is too remote from human affairs.<br />It took the Enlightenment of Western Europe to institute two new ideas of the god.  Is a god merely the starting point for nature's wonders, or does it even exist?  Armstrong here points out that until the Enlightenment, an \\"atheist\\" was one who didn't share your [or the community's] definition of the god.  Since the structure of all comunities had a religious basis, \\"atheism\\" was simply another word for non-conformity.  Armstrong stresses that the increasing knowledge of nature gained from Copernicus on led to new approaches to god, even questioning its existence.  The first widely known of these new atheist scholars was Diderot.  In assessing humanity's place in nature, many of the new scholars stressed the notion of compassion, finding it wanting in the traditional religions.  Armstrong finds Enlightenment scholars looking for justice, ethics and pity replacing piety.  Whether this new quest will find fulfillment in the future without \\"faith\\" is the subject of her concluding chapter.<br />Those seeking a god are certain to find one here.  The book abounds with them; nearly every page introduces some thinker defining a deity.  Armstrong's perceptive analysis shows the background to each proposed definition.  She does it with clear prose, not overly scholarly in tone, but not superficial or light-hearted.  She is at pains to demonstrate the three major faiths are not basically at odds.  Even her short jaunts of comparison with Buddhism and Hinduism fail to dislodge her focus.

Instead of grandmothers, aged aunts or toddler cousins, this book reveals life from  the dimmest past.  With photographs and drawings, Briggs and his colleagues have restored to view rare animals that lived in ancient seas.  These are our earliest forebears, and for that reason alone, this book is worth repeated scrutiny.  The images, with their stories of discovery and restoration, are offered in a spirit of shared discovery.  These are very special creatures and it behooves us all to understand their value.<br />Although the book is targeted for professional paleontologists, the authors give us text nearly as illustrative as the images.  They are part of the team who personally enticed many of these fossils from their lithic prison.  Beginning with an account of Charles Woolcott's trek into the mountains of British Columbia, they go on to describe the environment in which these creatures lived.  The significance of the Burgess Shale fossils, of course, is that they are images of soft body parts, usually lost as fossilization proceeds.  At the time of the original find in 1909, such artifacts, especially ones of such ancient deposition were pricelessly rare.  Woolcott himself understood their value to science, but never dedicated the necessary time to tease out their full secrets.  It took Briggs and others, particularly Simon Conway Morris to apply the painstaking effort to recreate the body forms locked in the shale.  In so doing, they overthrew a number of blithe assumptions made by a number of commentators, in particular Stephen J. Gould who had popularized the Shale finds, but sadly misinterpreted what they represent.<br />As you slowly turn over the pages of this book, reflect on the vast ages separating you from these creatures.  The sea has always kept some bizarre secrets, but few can match the multi-spined Hallucegenia or mud-burrowing Ottoia.  Haplophrentis might be mistaken for a Roman dagger lost in the sea until you read that its maximum length was but 30 millimetres long.  A more formidable denizen of these waters is the Anomalocaris, with its hooked feelers and rasping mouth.  Swimming in a sea with this half-meter long predator might not have been dangerous, but observing it might best be done from the beach.<br />This book is a clearly valuable contribution to our understanding of life's history and the process of evolution.  It belongs on the shelf next to the other albums of family history.  Take it down from time to time and simply open it at random.  With half-closed eyes it isn't difficult to see these creatures in their daily lives, clutching rocks, swimming through the water, or burrowing into the bottom.  They are your forebears, and deserve as much of your respect as does Aunt Matilda.plophrentis might be mistaken for a Roman dagger lost in the sea until you read that its maximum length was but 30 millimetres long.

Years of field work are applied in The Future of Life in a global tour of the world's natural resources.  How are they  used?  What has been lost?  What remains and is it sustainable with present rates of use?  With broad vision, Wilson stresses our need to understand fully the biodiversity of our planet.  Most importantly, that knowledge must include a realistic view of human impact on those resources.  While many works of this genre sound tocsins of despair with little to offer in countering the threat of the \\"outbreak\\" of humanity on our planet, Wilson proposes a variety of realistic scenarios that may save our world and our own species.  Survival will be obtained from a sound knowledge base, and the foundation for that insight starts here.<br />Wilson begins with an open letter to the patron saint of environment defenders, Henry David Thoreau.  He offers a comparative view of today's Walden Pond with that of Thoreau's day.  Wilson will use such comparisons for the remainder of the book.  The issue is clear:  humanity has done grave damage to its home over the millennia.  The growth of human population, but more importantly, the usurpation of the biosphere for limited human purposes, threatens a world losing its ability to cope with the intrusion.  Can this planet, with human help, be restored to biodiversity levels that will ensure its ongoing capacity to provide for us?<br />Wilson's writing skills readily match his talents as a researcher.  Presenting sweeping ideas with an economy of words, he avoids vague assertions or the need for the reader to fill in information.  With each stop of our global voyage in his company, he provides detailed information describing examples of human \\"erasure of entire ecosystems.\\"  At this pace, he informs us, we will soon require four more planets of our resource levels to sustain humanity's intended growth.  In the classic tradition, he introduces a protagonist for continued economic growth debating an environmental defender.  Both views can be accommodated, he assures us, but only if a population limiting bottleneck is achieved.  What level of humanity can the planet endure?  The numbers frighten, but the resolution, Wilson stresses, isn't inevitable.<br />Diversity, he argues, is the key.  Even our agricultural crops can benefit.  A mere hundred species are the foundation of our food supply, of which but twenty carry the load.  Wilson counters this precarious situation by urging investigation of ten thousand species that could be utilized.  Further, and this point will give many readers qualms, Wilson urges genetic engineering to apply desired traits between crop species.  He urges these strong measures as a means of reducing the clearing of habitats to enlarge farming acreage.  In conclusion, he stresses the application of ethical values in considering the environment.  Each of us must make ourselves aware of our impact on our nest.  If you are to survive, it may well rely on whether you read and act on the ideas in this book.  Although other works on this topic are available, Wilson's stands above the others for clarity, scope and suggestions for survival.

No false heroics or quests for rings or captive maidens.  This story is about today's values and how they impact tradition.  Gaiman adds a further novel touch by locating this tale in America's Midwest, the final stop for countless immigrants.  Small towns, flat country, constrained people, far from the rush and bustle of cities.  A perfect site for a cosmic battle.<br />Gaiman has written before of the last battle - Armageddon.  Good Omens, written with Terry Pratchett, pictured an angel [good] and a demon [evil] reassessing their roles before the final confrontation.  American Gods is likewise a departure from the traditional, with ancient gods rising to confront the new American god - Technology.  Odin, whose believers brought him across the Atlantic, conscripts Shadow, an ex-con, into acting as a cup-bearer.  Having lost his wife and the possibility of employment in a stroke, Shadow takes on the role.  He's not a believer, for him it's bed and board.  He grows attached to the idea that there may be something in helping the old duffer - a near-faith hardened by encounters with acolytes of the modern creed.  Odin, known to Shadow as Wednesday, is hardly the epitome  of \\"good.\\"  Technology's adherents, while not evil, are cold, harsh and power driven.  As it turns out, they are typically American - practical.<br />Shadow's role grows from mere go-fer for Wednesday to something more significant.  After all, why does Shadow's wife Laura return from the grave [and are there ever some grim scenes in that regard!]?  Why sequester a go-fer to a \\"perfect town\\" in northern Wisconsin for his protection?  Why do the Technology deities, especially the Media Goddess, work so hard to woo him to their cause?  Shadow dreams with such intensity it would put a normal person in a room with soft walls.  What keeps him sane?  What keeps him going against what appear to be insurmountable odds?  The answers aren't readily anticipated with Gaiman's skillful plot, darting and weaving as it builds.  It's not obscure, but neither is it predictable.  Gaiman's prose holds the reader's attention throughout.  With many threads of story line kept under tight discipline, Gaiman weaves a tapestry incorporating the real and the fantastic, the mundane and the bizarre.  The emerging picture makes compelling reading.<br />Gaiman's research for this book stands out everywhere.  The gods standing with Odin are nearly all Norse deities, but there's a sprinkling of others.  The Greek and Roman pantheons are ignored, perhaps because their adherents were suborned by the Eastern Mediterranean Mob, J.C. and The Boys.  Norse mythology has a comforting appeal, and \\"good\\" and \\"evil,\\" \\"sin\\" and \\"grace\\" had no place.  Besides, in the confrontation with technology, there seems little room for compromise, and a warrior deity to lead the host seems fitting.  Shadow, who has no religion, is gently educated in these northern gods as he encounters them.  They are his collective mentors, helping and encouraging him.  The reason for this attention is finally revealed at the end.  It's worth going there to find out.wers aren't readily anticipated with Gaiman's skillful plot, darting and weaving as it builds.

Many biblical critics have suggested the early books present several gods lumped together by editorial fiat.  Miles insists that the god of the Hebrew Bible is but one.  That circumstance, uniqueness and solitude, is the cause of various character changes this god went through in the course of history.  He has neither siblings nor peers.  It's a very human story, but  Miles doesn't portray this god as a human personification with superior powers.  On the contrary, this god is unaware of the powers he possesses until he tries them out.  They become, predictably, addictive with the passage of time.  As the god develops, he exhibits changes in character that would be considered &quot;growing up&quot; in people.  Finally, for unknown reasons, but perhaps just fatigue, the god retires from human contact.  People are left only with previous lessons to follow.<br />Although &quot;God&quot; is the result of intensive knowledge of the Hebrew Tanakh, Miles dismisses the notion that his study is a psychoanalysis of the god, but that's because he's dealing with a divinity.  The character variations Miles chronicles, the creator, destroyer, family patriarch, liberator and others, could be applied to any complex character.  Any good biography of a national leader might evince the same personifications.  The depiction might manifest as many, if not the same, characteristics.  Miles' demurral may be overlooked, since his presentation is a compelling account delivered with lively writing skill.  He is able to achieve a cool detachment, but not clinical aloofness, in presenting a deity to which he retains some level of adherence.<br />Miles' personal faith doesn't restrict what minimal judgments he offers on this god.  He accepts that the god reneges on promises, is a genocidal killer of some note, and punishes even those he claims to love with spontaneous wrath.  In early days, he doesn't seek worshippers, just obedient subjects.  We learn his sacrifices must be living creatures instead of agricultural crops, but the issue rises with Cain and repeats frequently.  It's an arbitrary decision, enforced with vigour, but the motivation remains hidden.  It all seems to boil down to whimsical expressions of power.  The power is challenged, however, in the outstanding chapters in this book, the account of Job.  Job's story has been retold countless times in various arenas, but Miles has analysed the account with fresh, engrossing insight.  In his view, Job wins the encounter by simply accepting the god enjoys greater power than he, responding &quot;So what?&quot;.  It's a given.  Job's not contesting the point, so why the terrible punishments?  Miles' god is here shown as lawgiver, but not an administrator of justice.

It's an arbitrary decision, enforced with vigour, but the motivation remains hidden.  It all seems to boil down to whimsical expressions of power.  The power is challenged, however, in the outstanding chapters in this book, the account of Job.  Job's story has been retold countless times in various arenas, but Miles has analysed the account with fresh, engrossing insight.  In his view, Job wins the encounter by simply accepting the god enjoys greater power than he, responding &quot;So what?&quot;.  It's a given.

If asked to define who you are, most people [excepting Daniel C. Dennett] would say, \\"Well, I'm me!\\"  Pressed to define this expression those same people would likely flounder about, ending with something about being \\"conscious of myself - I know in my mind.\\"  It is that notion of consciousness that Dennett seeks to explain to us in this absorbing book on mind/brain awareness.  Its audacious title notifies the reader that there are some fascinating concepts examined in this book.  Dennett's thinking and writing skills have few, if any, peers, but be advised the going isn't always easy.  'Self' is the ultimate philosophical question and Dennett is challenging some dearly cherished beliefs here.<br /><br />The most common expression of \\"self\\" nearly always boils down to the idea that our mind has a central area that observes the world around us.  That centre assesses and expresses our concepts of that world in thoughts, speech, writing, whatever.  It is that concept that Dennett assaults in this book.  Often referred to as the Cartesian Theatre from Rene Descarte's \\"I think, therefore I am\\" concept that the brain [physical] and mind [conceptual] were separate, Dennett finds this notion too simplistic.  He knows the mind is in the brain.  How it works in observing the world and expressing our ideas of it is the theme of this book.<br /><br />Dennett explains many facets of how we observe and how we react to what we observe.  He strives admirably to counter the still widely-held belief that consciousness is a tangible \\"thing\\" that can be identified and dealt with.  No such \\"thing\\" is there, he notes.  Instead, the mind is weighing input and dealing with many options at once.  He posits a concept of this situation he calls the 'Multiple Drafts' theory.  The mind/brain is continuously processing information and making selections about what to respond to and how to make the response.  Responses may be speech, writing or simply memory storage.<br /><br />While Dennett's use of terminology may make the novice quail, his down-to-earth approach to the issues makes this book delightful reading for anyone.  Instead of arcane concepts or lofty language from America's pre-eminent philosopher, we're given many concrete examples of how our minds work.  His stature, however, is in no small part due to his skills as a communicator.  Those skills are artfully expressed in this book.  If you have problems with terms like 'heterophenomenology' or 'qualia', take a moment to go back to his definitions, or read on to enjoy his explanations.  Either way, there are rewards.  Iin short, this whole book is rewarding and will go far in helping human beings understand just what they are.  We are conscious, we think, therefore we are human.  How to better understand that situation is amply explained by reading this outstanding book. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]r simply memory storage.

They outline the methods of dating, identifying and assembling hominid fossils.  Dating is shown to be, within the ranges of accuracy, nearly an absolute with today's technology.  With the age of the fossil[s] established and the parts identified, the fossil may then be placed in its proper location on the human family tree.  Poirier and McKee spend the remainder of the book describing the concepts, controversies and resolutions associated with that final step.  The material requires attentive perusal, but the interested reader will be richly rewarded.<br />Early hominid fossils were chronologically located by stratigraphy - the position of the fossil in the rocks in relation to other, known, remnants.  The early finds were often located in poorly identified areas, or mistakenly dated for a variety of reasons.  Paleoanthropologists of an earlier day lacked the technology available today.  Worse, they were often unaware of the need to examine the likely environment of the time the fossil was laid down.  As the authors point out, this misunderstanding led to misinterpretation of how evolutionary relationships were structured.  Today's &quot;digs&quot; are the subject of multi-discipline effort, with botanists, geologists and other fields represented.  The more comprehensive picture laid out by these environment associated with the find allow a firmer footing on our ancestral lineage.<br />While that assertion sounds promising and our heritage is now viewed with confidence, nothing could be further from the truth.  Where the human evolutionary tree once looked rather simple, with but a few offshoots extending from the central trunk, the improved accuracy of dating shows many branches.  How many of these truly belong on the main branch and how many led to the dead end of extinction is what gives this book its real value.<br />Paleoanthropology has been among the liveliest of sciences.  The debates and controversies have left academic halls and achieved public exposure.  Poirier and McKee present the contentions of most of the major figures in the field with circumspection and clarity.  With each new find, various interpretations arose, researchers attacking and defending positions from various foundations.  The authors give each assertion its due, with resolution occasionally based on their own assessment.  They have no hesitation in stating their own position, but it's given with justifications.  Counter arguments are made with confirming data.  Evidence is shown, but not nearly as strongly as the need for new results.  This book, in many respects, reads like an academic work, but that in no small part is due to the authors'<br />call for more work in the field.<br />It would be unfair to say that every hominid fossil is given the authors' personal scrutiny, but the impression is proximate.  Nearly every major site, with many of the associated prime fossils are described, sometimes with maps and photographs.  The illustrative material, maps, diagrams and photographs are invaluable.  About the only missing element is a single skeleton and skull with the bones frequently discussed in the book labeled.  While many are, they must be examined out of context in many cases.  If you have the anatomy, you won't need the information, but the rest of us require the crutch.<br />For anyone wishing to keep abreast of the research in determining where humanity comes from, this book is a treasure.  Given the amount of information the authors had to cope with, the work is clear, unequivocal and immensely valuable.  While not a light read, there's little to obstruct even the novice reader.  The material is well organized and presented with a clear, straightforward style.  Since the authors' aim is to explain [and recruit!] without perplexing the reader or seeking adherence to positions, they have produced a book that will endure.The debates and controversies have left academic halls and achieved public exposure.

Twain transports a Connecticut shop foreman twelve centuries into the past [and 5 000 kilometres!] to Camelot and Arthur's court.  Initially confused and dismayed, Hank Morgan's Yankee practicality is quickly aroused and he becomes a major figure among the  panopolied knights.  With the title of The Boss, his rank equals The King or The Pope with its uniqueness.  His elevation doesn't distract him from a more profound impulse, however.  Hank's Yankee roots and wide experience evoke an ambition - nothing less than revolution.  He wants to sweep away the monarchy and aristocracy and establish an American-style republic in Arthurian Britain.<br />Mark Twain's scathing criticism of the sham of hereditary monarchy bolstered by an Established Church makes this among his choicest writings.  He resents the condition of a Church which \\"turned a nation of men into a nation of worms.\\"  A fervent believer in individual freedom, Twain uses Hank to voice his disdain of Britain's royalty.  It's no more than might be expected of a man who boasted of but one ancestor - who sat on the jury that executed Charles I.  Hank knows revolutions never succeed when implemented from above.  Revolution be achieved only when the individual's attitude changes from meek acceptance to<br />self assertion.  Hank's method reaches people through clandestine schools and factories, publication of a newspaper and establishment of a telephone system.  These new forms of manufacture and communication become the foundation by which Hank expects to abolish the ancient, mis-named, chivalric tradition.  Does he change the course of history?<br />Twain relocates the roots of American democracy from the heart of the frontier yeoman farmer to the brain of the urban industrial worker.  Here the man of wide, practical experience shows how to survive compared to those with a formal education.  Hank has a simple ambition - establishment of a republic - but utilizes a broad spectrum of ideas to bring it about.  He would gladly replace the Established Church of Rome with his own Presbyterian ideals, but is aware that it would be swapping one evil for another.  \\"Each man should select his own religion, or make one\\" he contends.  Yet, finally, it is this dread force that impairs his desire for change.  The final sequence stands as a peer to the biblical Armageddon, Twain wallowing in a frightful bloodletting unseen in any of his other works.<br />Mark Twain contrasts the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution with the  centuries of slavery, serfdom, and poverty that killed countless more people than that spasm of excising of aristocracy.  What else spurred him to write of human rights with such passion?  He had written of slavery before, but this book is especially wrathful in describing the \\"peculiar institution\\" eliminated in his homeland but a generation before.  He forces the king to experience the slave's condition, a form of degradation he would have all aristocrats endure.  Every feature of the human condition is examined in this timeless treasure.  He challenges you to follow his gaze, considering whether today's societies, monarchical or not, will endure the scrutiny.imple ambition - establishment of a republic - but utilizes a broad spectrum of ideas to bring it about.

They are vanished today, the last of their lineage in tourist boats, unremarked, nearly unremembered.  Nearly two centuries ago, the Mississippi steamboat pilot was a legendary figure.  Mark Twain conveys us to that time and environment in one of his finest writings.  Life On the Mississippi is a superb descriptive achievement in portraying the river scene , but also conveys vivid images of the people living on and along it.  It's an outstanding example of painting with both a broad brush and enhancing with fine detail.<br />Beginning with a history of European &quot;discovery&quot; and exploration of this mighty stream, Twain moves us into his own history as a &quot;cub&quot; pilot.  Perhaps no-one before or since has so effectively exposed what it meant to &quot;tackle the river&quot; in learning to safely man the wheel of a river steamer.  From his first astonishment at discovering he must &quot;get a notebook and write down&quot; the names of all the points, landmarks, snags and &quot;crossings&quot; through the realization that most of that information would change before his next trip, he comes to understand that a pilot must &quot;know the river&quot; with full dedication.  As we follow him through the process he introduces us to the river's wonders and the people it supports.  He explains the ranking of pilots, steamboat captains, mates and &quot;hands.&quot;  None of his observations are boring, from the  most mundane river condition to dramatic events such as boiler explosions.<br />Those fearing that Twain's information may be &quot;outdated&quot; may take heart.  Much of the book views his early days on the river from the vantage point of thirty years later.  He is reminiscing, but Twain's excellent style brings us with him into each memory.  Our feelings readily align with his as he guides us.  The latter part of the book is a collection of images of the river valley in the latter part of the 19th Century as Twain revisits the river after a long absence.  The only real distinction, apart from the automobile, which did for the railroad what the latter did to the steamboat, are the statistics of agriculture and industry.  His descriptions of towns, villages and cities differ little from what we might encounter duplicating his journey.<br />During this pilgrimage, Twain brings in numerous anecdotal episodes to further sparkle his descriptive and historical accounts.  Although all are entertaining at one level or another,  several stand out as representatives of Twain's inventive genius.  Ritter's Narrative is among the grimmest of Twain's essays in any of his publications.  It's a story of a long-term quest for vengeance with a bizarre outcome.  A far lighter note is struck with the story of a sleepwalking steamboat pilot.  An account of the pilots organizing a &quot;protective association&quot; is told with light humour, not quite obscuring the serious nature of its intent.<br />In all, no matter that this book's focus lies in a period stretching back nearly two centuries, the writing is vigorous enough to capture today's readers.  The history is related with Twain's always lively skill, something as mundane as a sunset is imparted with his special verve.  This book can be taken up repeatedly; for reminders of a lost era, for an examination of values or, the best reason of all, for a prime example of what North America's greatest writer could produce in his passion for narrative.part of the book is a collection of images of the river valley in the latter part of the 19th Century as Twain revisits the river after a long absence.

Why was it given a prestigious Canadian literary award?  Burnard' research is faulty, her motivation unclear and she spends uncountable words describing things that don't contribute to the tale.<br />The story concerns a small minded, small family in a small town.  Bill Chambers returns mutilated from World War II to Stonebrook, a community of five hundred houses.  This little village maintains Anglican, Catholic and Unitarian churches [at least], a doctor [not likely], a funeral parlour [less likely] and a golf course [implausible].  Having married a pregnant Sylvia and sired three children, an \\"attack from the air\\" in the North Atlantic [highly unlikely] results in lost fingers.  Why Chambers abandoned his family for war remains unexplained: \\"he just had to go.\\"  His return is mundane - in fact, the first major event is the installation of a town hall fire siren seven years later!  The loss of fingers causes Bill to learn to be left handed.  No further significance attaches [sorry!] to their loss.  And things go on from there . . .<br />The Chambers children grow, attend school, get married, have more Chambers.  Only one, Daphne, follows a more erratic path.  Her jaw deformed from a childhood incident, she, predictably, remains single.  Also predictably, Daphne exhibits the most intelligence in the family, hence the most independence.  A school chum, Murray, flits about the Chambers' household, with predictable repercussions revealed to us, but not to the family.  Something in Sylvia goes haywire, and, predictably, she expires.  Her replacement, predictably, is the town's only mature single woman, whose link with the family is that she's Bill's bookkeeper.<br />Tired yet?  Stiffen your patience.  You have another 230 pages to go before arriving at the book's final word: \\"Yes.\\".  To get there you must submit to extended descriptions of other houses.  Yes, the buildings; their sttructure, trim, paint, yard flora and, finally, some people in them.  Children graduate, enter uni [or not], have spats with parents or each other, wander off somewhere.  By the time the grandchildren arrive, you're convinced that the best people to read this are those going for a CAT scan.  The nurses want you relaxed for the procedure.  The only stress this book offers is the perplexity from wondering why it was written.  By Chapter 1963 [chapter titles are years, not numbers or words], you've forgotten this is an award winning book.  Because you don't care.<br />Sex!  I almost forgot the sex!  That's pretty numbing also, although the women seem interested in it - a novelty in small town Ontario.  One woman grows so inquisitive about sex that she conceives twice, producing bastard girls which seems to concern no-one in a town of five hundred homes.  Bizarre, given the spacing of the births.  Yet Burnard, in another display of inconsistency, has one teen-age couple copulating without protection for a whole school year without issue.  Until they marry.  Children arrive until the magic number three [per wife] is achieved.  Further births are prevented, but how or why we never learn.  Economics?  Bedroom space?<br />Why was this book written?  To expound on traditional family values?  Given the number of divorces and re-marriages, plus Bill's quickly terminated grief, this seems unlikely.  The advantages of small-town living?  Perhaps, but Burnard offers no comparisons with urban life or other rural towns.  There's a certain discomfort displayed by children who go off to uni, a feeling instantly shed on returning \\"home.\\"  Those who leave Stonebrook for places like Vancouver or Toronto are viewed as aberrant by \\"the family,\\" but the attitude is only mildly expressed.  In fact, there's not a shred of passion about anything in this book.  Except sex, of course.  Even that is, again, but lightly asserted.<br />Women's issues?  Here, one suspects, is the crux of this book.  Elsewhere, Burnard contends that: \\"As long as the most basic nurturing unit, a woman and child, appears among us, we will have use for the word family.\\"  Which pretty much explains it.  The men are there for procreation and to provide the incomes keeping the \\"Good House\\" running.  Men aren't a necessary part of the \\"family.\\"  Burnard's \\"family\\" in this book include an increasingly churlish father, an independent daughter and three \\"sons\\" [including the satellite Murray].  The men's chief role in the book is to introduce an increasing number of women, their successsive wives, into the story.  As Bill grows more irascible with age, the family's focus increasingly comes to reside in the replacement mother, Margaret.  In her view, the Chambers family is the stuff of legend, which Burnard has the face to endorse.  With so many wives and children, the \\"family\\" has expanded to a clan.  Thus the book's title is finally explained.  We're not dealing with buildings, although Burnard's spent countless words describing them, but rather a small town aristocracy.<br />Why this is the stuff of a major literary award is elusive.  No values are extolled - certainly not traditional ones.  The reader is challenged only in the acceptance of many implausibilities.nard contends that: \\"As long as the most basic nurturing unit, a woman and child, appears among us, we will have use for the word family.\\"  Which pretty much explains it.

Their discarded garbage, however, is laced with traces of magic.  Out on the tip, the rats forage in the scraps - apple cores, candle stubs [good carbohydrate source], dogends.  Like any trace mineral, the magic builds up until the rats have changed, gaining new talents.  Among those talents are speaking and reading.  Speaking allows them to communicate better while the reading gives them words to use as names.  They're an organized group now, and they have an ambition.  They want to find a safe place for retirement.  They have a mentor, Maurice, a cat who shares their talents, but has an extra one of his own - he's a con cat.  And he has a story hidden away.<br />A street smart feline, Maurice has learned the value of money.  He knows how humans use it, and he wants the independence it offers.  To gain it, he's organized the rats and adopted Keith, a rather simple human, into his group.  Together, they work the towns to create a &quot;plague of rats&quot; then provide a piper, Keith, to lure them away - for cash.  Despite disputes over percentages, the team has scored many successful ventures.  But Keith, and the rats, are having misgivings over the ethics of the con.  They want to quit, and Bad Blintz will be the last place they work the con.<br />Every venture has its risks.  Bad Blintz is clearly not a rich place.  The villagers queue up for bread and sausages, which are in short supply.  There are rat catchers who carry strings of tails, but the team can't find a live rat anywhere in the maze of cellars and tunnels beneath the town.  In resolving this conundrum, team encounters a powerful new force - one that challenges all the skills given them by the wizards' residue magic.  Their very survival rests on how they deal with the mystery.  Its resolution is consummately Pratchett.<br />Terry Pratchett's books increasingly delve into philosophical questions, even moral ones.  It would be nice to know if he actually intended this book for &quot;children.&quot;  You'll note above that the publishers call for &quot;Reader Level Ages 9 - 12,&quot; but the editorial reviews say &quot;12 and up.&quot;  The disparity is typical Pratchett.

If you are new to his work, this is a fine place to start.  If you're an established fan, there's nothing here to disappoint you.  Add this book to your library and buy another for someone.  Anyone.  They'll surely be grateful.	2002-01-16

It lies at the foundation of the &quot;great silence&quot; experienced by Ursula Hegi and other children who had to come to America to discover the Holocaust.  Hegi and her peers grew up in a vacuum of information about the Nazi years.  Realization came as a shock, disillusioning some, generating anger and resentment in others.  But as Hegi's subjects relate, few cast off their roots.  Some made pilgrimages to the sites of the Nazi crimes.  Others sought understanding from parents who kept them in ignorance.  Assembling a collection of interviews with her counterparts, Hegi gives us their viewpoints, life histories and introspections of their pasts.  It's a unique and worthy effort.<br />In trying to reveal the present feelings of German children who came to America, Hegi undertook to understand for herself why Germans remained reticent about the Nazi years.  She delved into people's lives through the interviews, asking them to examine their own feelings to see how they equated with her own.  Clearly, the responses amazed her with their familiarity.  Silence from the older generation and a strong desire to understand the root causes of Nazism in the younger, immigrant population.<br />The stories told, garnered from twenty three individuals, relate the upbringing and disrupted lives of Germans, usually children, who carry the burden of their parents' origins.  American children, cognizant of the Holocaust in ways the immigrant children were not, might characterize their German-born peers as &quot;Nazis,&quot; even when it was clearly impossible.  For most of the interviewees, the accusation was more mysterious than offending.  Confident of their own innocence, whatever resentment arose was usually directed at their families in Germany.<br />While this book is of great value in bringing the memories of the post-Nazi generation into view, it also poses some interesting questions.  Oppressive fathers and submissive mothers aren't a uniquely German phenomenon.  We aren't even clear as to whether these dominating parents are viewed as Nazis or sympathizers by Hegi's subjects.  The only common theme, unique among immigrants to America, is the Holocaust.  Some wonder how &quot;normal&quot; people could have engaged in such barbarity, asking themselves how they would have reacted had they been aware of the circumstances.  Hegi, as investigative journalist in this book, is careful to avoid judgment.  But the subjects raising these questions pose another: how did they view injustices in their adopted country.<br />Few current prejudices are related in the interviews.  One man admits to discomfort at seeing the &quot;Dots;&quot; South Asians &quot;who &quot;smell bad&quot; and &quot;never offer you a fair profit.&quot;  The reader cannot help but wonder how these people reacted to the protest movements of the 1960s.  Did they react to racial hatred in America with quiet acceptance as their parents had done in Germany?  Unlike Germany, the violent reaction to protest was visible on any news channel in America.  Did they object to America's most controversial war, or support it?  One is left with the impression that these exiles comprised part of Richard Nixon's &quot;Silent Majority&quot; and that they, like the parents they admonish, remained equally silent when confronted by issues of moral weight.  What Hegi has done is document again the universal that ethical values remain the province of those who stand to be counted.

You won't find much hilarity here, although you will encounter fine writing expressed with penetrating wit.  If you're a dedicated Discworld advocate, you'll find this book rather more than \\"another Discworld novel.\\"  Casting a skein of plot threads, he's able to weave them together into a coherent finale.  In particular, he achieves new levels of excellence in creating and portraying characters.  But it's his view of the Cosmos that captures and holds your attention here.  Pratchett is too often portrayed as a \\"fantasy writer\\" in contrast with \\"science fiction\\" authors.  Yet, as this book shows, he has a better grasp of science than most within the \\"SF\\" genre.  He's shown up the \\"science writers\\" in presenting complex questions in understandable terms.  If those descriptions use fantasy tempered with the famous Pratchett wit, we've all gained.<br /><br />Lobsang Ludd is a thief.  His wondrous abilities at theft are due to speed.  He's unstoppable.  He can pick up closely observed items with impunity, disgorging them upon request or his own whim.  How does he manage it?  A foundling at the Thieves' Guild, he's spotted in Ankh-Morpork by a \\"field operative\\" monk and sent to the Monks of History temple in the Ramtops.  His abilities lead to his assignment as an apprentice to Lu-Tze.  Why should Lobsang be given such a role when Lu-Tze is only the temple Sweeper?<br /><br />In Ankh-Morpork, meanwhile, another lad, Jeremy Clockson, also exhibits amazing talents.  He's a clock maker, the best in the business.  He's so good, the Guild has exiled him.  Only a few blocks from the Guildhall, but far enough to shed responsibility for him.  His reputation for accurate clocks has caught the attention of Lady LeJean, who commissions him to build \\"a clock of perfect accuracy.\\"  Such a clock, it seems, will stop time.  Does this matter to Lobsang?<br /><br />It's staggering to think what Pratchett went through in writing this book.  Ankh-Morpork without the Watch or the Patrician.  Distortion of reality without the meddling of the Wizards.  Death, who last convened the other Horseman for a game of Bridge [\\"You tell me humans do this for fun?\\"] seeks out War, Pestilence and Famine: they have to Ride Out.

He would probably shout it from mountain tops if he thought anybody would listen.  Rivers In Time is a call to readers to join him in diagnosis and therapy to restore the patient to health.  Ward vehemently asserts that our planet's in trouble - again.  As a paleontologist specializing in extinction, he has deep insight into the circumstances of the mass deaths occurring through Earth's history.  He shares these insights with us in vivid prose describing the great dyings of millions of years ago.  His descriptions of the evidence surrounding the loss of multiple life forms make compelling reading.  He takes us on his journeys through southern Africa, the Canadian West Coast and Pacific Islands.  Along the way he shares the evidence of extinctions in deep time, charting events and conditions.<br />This book, however, is not simply a history of extinctions nor a scientific treatise.  It is a warning from the past about our future.  Ward builds his scenarios in order to examine the evidence surrounding the extinctions in hope of discovering what caused them.  In each case he goes on to describe the subsequent conditions in which new life forms evolved.  The emerging pattern remains obscure.  One fact stands out, however.  Life became increasingly diverse in the eras after the sudden loss of major extinction events.  Knowledge of diversity is important in understanding what is occurring now, and what that means for the future of our planet and ourselves.  And we aren't spending enough resources in learning about how diverse the life surrounding us actually is.  That ignorance is a charge against our survival account.<br />No extinction has received more attention than the disappearance of the dinosaurs.  Our children know that without their passing, the mammals would have remained tiny, nocturnal, creatures, hidden and obscure.  Ward uses the wonderful film, King of Hearts to illustrate how little furry creatures found an empty world in which to proliferate after the dinosaurs were lost.  Eventually, those minimal animals evolved into forest dwelling primates who were driven from the trees to become humans.  Unlike their predecessors, human animals invaded every ecological niche.  With them came revisions of the environment of evolution; rapid habitat loss, chemical pollution and the introduction of alien species.<br />Ward concludes his treatise with some challenging questions.  He adopts Edward O. Wilson, Norman Myers and others to posit what has happened, what needs to be done, and what our future options are for planetary survival.  The diagnosis completed, now it's time to apply some therapy.  The most daunting first step in this therapy is our own self-awareness: what is the condition of the planet?  How can we learn more about what is happening?  What prescriptions are required to cure the loss of biodiversity allowing the pace of evolution to be restored to its proper level?  He has hope for the future, but only if we are all aware of what needs to be done, and to do it.  The starting point is reading and understanding the message of this book.  The next step is exercising the will to change the current pace of extinctions.

Kenneth Miller may have achieved some level of immortality with this book.  In erecting the ultimate redoubt in defence of the idea of a deity, he's built a structure with elements of &quot;hard&quot; science cemented with almost heartwarming personal experience.  Miller is in the tradition of rear guard actions Christians have staged in response to science since Galileo.  The pattern is familiar: researchers disclose another of nature's secrets, and the faithful respond: &quot;O.K., that's how THAT works, but you can't explain . . . [whatever].  Therefore, God must be responsible for [whatever].&quot;  As each &quot;whatever&quot; is revealed as being neither divinely created or controlled, a new barricade is erected and the process repeated.  What he achieves, however, is an expression of personal faith of value only to himself.<br />This Miller's tale begins with a frank admission of the religious indoctrination of his childhood.  His parish priest asserted that &quot;only God can make a flower.&quot;  Miller's education as a biologist revealed that flowers make flowers and how evolution brought that about.  For Miller, however, learning about evolution didn't lead him to discard his deity, as in Darwin's case.  But the sort of god he can accept differs from the one portrayed in his early years.  He's able to accept what scientists bring to light in the way of Nature's processes without losing faith.  His real target here is dogmatics; the Christian &quot;creationists&quot; who attack Darwin as an enemy of faith.<br />Miller's defends Darwin's idea of evolution by natural selection by confronting expressive adversaries.  Well-known anti-Darwin exponents as Henry Morris, Phillip Johnson and Michael Behe have their arguments carefully scrutinized, assessed and refuted.  In each case, these advocates have distorted the image Miller's god wants to convey.  He views their pictures of a god as a &quot;charlatan,&quot; &quot;magician,&quot; or &quot;mechanic&quot;; unwarranted and mistaken images.  Christian creationists bind and restrict their deity in ways that deny human will, leaving us in an unsuitable robotic role.  Instead, Miller contends that god's plan is to free intelligent humans to pursue nature's wonders; research that will reveal a novel concept of god.<br />He then takes up the non-theists, who are clearly more intellectually challenging.  Titling this chapter &quot;The Gods of Disbelief&quot; is pretty heavy irony, but Miller wants to portray E.O. Wilson, Richard Dawkins, Richard Lewontin and Daniel C. Dennett as dogmatists.  Educated dogmatists, but still too fixed in their thinking for his liking.  Having found a god, Miller wants these bright scholars to shed their dogmatism to follow him along a scientifically enlightened path.  Miller's god resides in Martin Rees' &quot;Just Six Numbers&quot;:  the basic forces binding the cosmos.  These constants are so finely tuned that tiny fluctuations wouldn't allow the universe, and us, to exist.  Miller argues that the reason for this narrow equilibrium is us - human beings who have evolved to discover these forces and the god they represent.  The cosmic forces permitted the creation of stars, planets and finally, life.  He argues that we are the inevitable, if delayed, purpose of creation - created to find god through physics.<br />Miller spends some time discrediting the idea of deism.  In deism, a deity kick-starts the universe, then sits back to watch events unfolding.  This concept keeps a deity at arm's length, giving humans free rein in explaining Nature.  Deism was professed mainly by intellectuals like Thomas Jefferson and Voltaire who resented the traditional vengeful god.  Their deity set a basic moral framework, then allowed humans the power to determine how to apply it to society.  As an idea focussing on individuals but not community, deism never became widespread.  Certainly there was no organizational element, and left priests and ministers &quot;out ofthe loop.&quot;  Along with the rest of the population.<br />In the final analysis, however, Miller's faith espouses an updated form of deism.  Researchers such as Dawkins, Lewontin and others that he represents as seeking an &quot;absolute materialistic&quot; explanation of the universe and life must necessarily fail. Their failure is manifested in the one area research cannot reveal - the state and position of subatomic particles.  &quot;The ultimate mastery of even the tiniest bit of matter in the universe will always elude us.&quot; [p.209] This, in his mind, is the sure sign of an Originator who set the conditions resulting in human evolution and intelligence.  Miller has merely updated Jefferson by explaining the findings of many researchers since the latter's time.  The new deity Miller proposes remains the cosmic clock-winder of the 18th Century.<br />The issue posed by this book is not whether a deity exists.  Miller is at some pains throughout to show nothing &quot;proves&quot; there's a god &quot;out there.&quot;  The real question is why an intelligent, articulate scientist should feel the need to sanction such a phantom in the face of all logic.  E.O. Wilson wrote, &quot;The enduring paradox of [faith] is that so much of its substance is demonstrably false, yet it remains a driving force in all societies.&quot;  That is the enduring question and one can only wish Miller might put his abilities to addressing it.  Miller's title reflects Darwin's distress at Asa Gray's discomfort over whether evolution denied his god.  Miller, too, is distressed.  As a scientist he responds to Wilson's paradox with yet another redoubt, this one built of unmeasureable subatomic particles.  Like the earlier Deism, this deity is far distant and offers little comfort.  Perhaps if the money pouring into churches was put to answering Wilson's dilemma, that deity can finally be put aside and humans can find ways of comforting each other instead of committing harm in the name of faith.  If Darwin/Miller's god made the universe to evolve our intelligence, let's put that aptitude to work for our benefit, not for some ephemeral spirit without the ability to contribute to our survival as a species.the loop.&quot;  Along with the rest of the population.<br />In the final analysis, however, Miller's faith espouses an updated form of deism.

Sunburned Country isn't a travel guide.  It's a traveler's journal.  This makes the book a bit difficult to assess.  It's usually displayed in the Travel section of your local bookstore.  If you're looking for recommendations of places to stay, you'll find little guidance here.  If you're looking for places to visit, this book is a treasure.  If you're looking for a good read, it's doubly a treasure.  If you already have feelings about Australia, pro or con, then this book is certain to arouse ire.  You cannot leave this book unmoved.  Besides, for all its shortcomings, it's a fun read.<br />Divided into segments due to intermittent trips across the Equator, Bryson manages to present his journeys as a nearly continuous narrative.  Americans travel journalists are uniformly surprised by the size of Australia, and Bryson's no exception.  His travels around Australia are at a frenetic pace trying to cover the ground.  He's dismayed to discover Brisbane isn't &quot;just up the coast&quot; from Sydney.  Five minutes with a map would have disabused him of that myopic view.  He seems always in haste, his pace leaving little opportunity for serendipitous exploration.  Mostly standard travel fare, he targets the urban sites: Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Darwin, Perth and The Alice.  A couple of exceptions will be noted.<br />Bryson is concerned with his comfort.  He never camps, preferring hotel/motel convenience - they usually have, or are near to, pubs.  For most of the book he's on the road from one town to the next.  The result, particularly driving from Darwin to the Alice, allows no time for close examination of what he terms &quot;featureless&quot; and &quot;inexhaustible&quot; deserts.  A little more research might have directed him to the Red Center's fascinating variety.  But you have to stop the car and walk around a bit to accomplish that.  Part of the reason he failed to make even brief  saunters is his nearly pathological fear of Australia's fauna.  The worst aspect of this book is Bryson's litany of Australia's dangerous creatures.  From the box jellyfish through taipans to the infamous redback spider [which he incorrectly describes], he presents the reader with numerous examples of how careless people have suffered their defense of territory.  There's a strange ambivalence here, since he's clearly enthralled by many aspects of Australia's natural wonders.  His circumvention of Uluru [Ayer's Rock] comprises but two hours, all of it by vehicle.  He's disappointed with the monolith's colour, unaware of the impact of changing light on The Rock.<br />Yet, on occasion, when he deems it safe, he alights, closely viewing some of the natural wonders.  How many travel writers have the acuity to visit [and recommend] Hamelin Pool in Western Australia?  As Bryson is at pains to point out, Hamelin Pool should be one of the premier World Heritage sites.  It contains one of the few sites where the original organisms leading to writers and readers [after some 3.5 thousand million years] still reside.  It would have been an experience to stand beside him as he explained this phenomenon to the tourist woman who disparaged what she observed.  Bryson, bless him, relies heavily on Richard Fortey's LIFE; AN UNAUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY in educating this woman.  He could find few better authorities to use.  And he believes what he writes.<br />As a travel writer, he deals with many people.  Hotel clerks, restaurant waitresses, museum tenders and other tourist contacts.  As in any country, there are the good ones and the others.  He's forthright in his assessments, but his comfort and convenience stand paramount.  He's good at laughing at himself, especially in regard to his fear of venomous creatures.  Mostly the journeys are solitary, but his trips to the Barrier Reef and along the highway from Darwin to Alice Springs are in company with journalist Allan Sherwin.  It becomes another chance to expound on the wildlife - particularly the deadlier forms.  Among his chants of dangerous fauna, he manages to provide numerous historical anecdotes.  He truly shines here, bringing to life people who have crossed the Australian scene.  From the first Dutch landings [where stranded mutineers gained notoriety as the first white &quot;settlers&quot;] to the &quot;dullest man in Australia [Prime Minister John Howard], Bryson fills in details on places and events.  If nothing else, these vignettes provide excellent background material for his travels.  It may be enough to prompt reading another Bryson book.

New ideas emerge almost with<br />every fossil discovery and dogmatic thoughts have no place in the science.  As a professional<br />paleontologist [ i almost said &quot;practicing&quot;, but his approach is far to serious for that!]. he has<br />all the qualifications to relate this story.  With the growing number of general level books on<br />the development of life being released recently, it's difficult to choose among them.  This book<br />certainly ranks among the top choices.<br />Quite simply, this book is what it claims to be: a history of 3 500 million years of earth's plant<br />and animal inhabitants.  Fortey achieves masterful balance between presenting general<br />themes with illustrative details.  In one example, he shows the value of mites in soil<br />development and what their loss would mean to global environment.  The unspoken message<br />about the use of pesticides is a silent outcry for us to recognize such details.<br />Merged with the scientific work of many researchers are Fortey's accounts of his personal<br />experiences as a paleontologist.  His scenario of the scientific conference makes compelling<br />reading for anyone wishing to grasp the underlying themes of scientific conflicts.  Reaching<br />beyond his own work, he introduces us to many noteworthy colleagues.  Few are criticized<br />for the value of their work, but their personal habits are subjected to pointed comments.<br />None of these are out of place; Fortey clearly mourns the loss of colleagues who would have<br />continued producing welcome results had they not been lost.

Wright's response to that all-important question is that &quot;all influences on human behaviour,<br />environmental as well as hereditary, are mediated biologically&quot; [p. 311].  Quite simply,<br />humans are part of the animal kingdom.  The roots of our behaviour lie deep in our<br />evolutionary past.  We may like to think our position in Nature is unique.  Wright reminds us<br />that all life is linked by a common hereditary mechanism.  We have many traits that contrast<br />us from other animals, but there are too many similarities to deny our place is drastically<br />removed from them.  Wright's fine synopsis supporting this picture draws on the work of<br />many researchers and presents it in an imaginative and intelligible book.  Although recent<br />works have embellished this book, nothing has yet replaced it.<br />Darwin's 1859 publication of The Origin of Species started the erosion process of humanity's<br />self-constructed pedestal of near divinity.  Since then, research in human behaviour has<br />grown more intense.  The first major step, although not one based on natural selection, was<br />Sigmund Freud's studies of the roots of human behaviour.  Not until the 1975 publication of<br />E.O. Wilson's &quot;Sociobiology&quot; was Darwin's idea firmly applied to the human condition.<br />Wilson's effort met with a storm of abuse, tempering use of the title as a scientific discipline.<br />Wright has chosen &quot;evolutionary psychology&quot; from among the plethora of substitutions that<br />have emerged [giving a discomforting credibility to psychology as a discipline].  However, it<br />isn't the phrase that's important.  The concept of who we are, summarized in the opening<br />quote is the issue.  Wilson's triumph is in the wealth of superior research that has gone into<br />validating his thesis.<br />Wright draws on researchers who've made careful studies and taken significant steps in<br />exposing those genetic roots.  William Hamilton, George C. Williams and Robert Trivers,<br />building on Darwin's foundation, have confirmed Wilson's proposal in various ways.  The<br />key term in the quote, &quot;mediated&quot; defies those who rant about &quot;genetic determinism.&quot;  Wright<br />carefully denies there are specific genes &quot;for&quot; any specific behaviour pattern.  The many<br />researchers he cites concur that humans are too complex for such simple answers.  Genes<br />combine and interact, but the results of their activity remain rooted in biological adaptations.<br />Wright sees sex and the strategies in pursuit of it as the foundation of most of our behaviour.<br />Competition, status, even obtaining food and shelter are all related to how we handle<br />questions of sex and passing of genetic information.  Males and females ARE different, but the<br />ways in which they differ emerge in a new light in Wright's analysis.<br />Feminists will [have!] rail against Wright's non-egalitarian picture of gender relationships.<br />This isn't surprising, given that the feminist movement has firmly detoured around biology<br />[the most vivid example being the &quot;denial&quot; of DNA].  Wright effectively counters narrow<br />views by arguing that a better understanding of our biological roots will enable us to improve<br />those relationships.  Further, he argues that a host of legal questions will require revision in<br />light of the new knowledge.  A &quot;gene for burglary&quot; will not be an accepted defense, but new<br />forms of law must result from an improved comprehension of what makes a human.  If<br />nothing else in this book gives it merit, the idea that cultural &quot;norms&quot; must be cogently<br />addressed is a valuable contribution in bringing biology and other unrelated disciplines to a<br />new level of communication.  Rewards, punishments, fame and failure are manifestations of<br />our ideas of morality.  Wright's discussion of those values makes this work a &quot;must read&quot; for a<br />wide variety of people.  Buy it, read it and pass it to others.  It makes a fine present.iety of people.

Cohen and Stewart here campaign for a new view of the evolution of human thinking.  Their technique rests on the idea of recursive development of human cognitive capacity; building from simple foundations through increasing complexity.  Their most innovative technique is a comparison of human outlook on nature, the cosmos and humanity with a fictitious alien culture based on eight.  The Zarathustrians, who need eight members to be an &quot;individual&quot;, can be equally rigid in their thinking, but the framework is wholly different from ours.  The technique provides a compelling means of looking at our evolutionary record from a different viewpoint and allows the posing of questions we should all be asking ourselves about who we are.  The technique adds entertainment to a highly original and readable book.<br />Arguing that humans are &quot;in nature but not of it&quot; the authors separate us from the rest of the animal kingdom.  What makes us different is our mental complexity.  We can control our thoughts, make choices, impact the surrounding environment instead of merely responding to it.  How did we come to be that way?  The record of evolution shows that life's origins were clearly very simple.  Perhaps, as they relate, a beginning as simple as some molecules &quot;hitching a ride&quot; on crystals as a step in learning the process of replication.  From such origins, life progressed through building complexity in gradual steps, with some branches able to increase in complexity leading to such as you and i.  The mechanism works in &quot;phase space&quot; by combining simple forms in a process they call &quot;complicity.&quot;  Complicity is Nature using existing &quot;scaffolding&quot; to build successful features.  In short, evolution.<br />The flip side of this captivating book is their crusade against &quot;reductionism.&quot;  This straw man is a frequent target for those unable or unwilling to see human beings as an integral part of the animal kingdom, hence, a product of the evolutionary process.  You will not find the target of their attack until you peruse the bibliography, but it becomes clear that their aim is Richard Dawkins.  His &quot;selfish gene&quot; concept and his proposal on cultural aspects, a major element in their argument, are assaulted or ignored.  How did the human mind evolve its distinct characteristics if not through genetic processes?  The authors make great show of cultural continuity as an expression of human mental capacity.  Yet, they fail to identify the roots of that persistence.  The root was postulated by Richard Dawkins as the &quot;meme,&quot; the mind's equivalent of genetic transmission of characteristics.  Given Dawkins' concept preceded Figments by over a decade, their omission of the term is an astonishing oversight.<br />The great irony here is Cohen and Stewart's reliance on Daniel C. Dennett as a source for much of their thinking.  One can envision that jolly, St Nicholas-like countenance hardening  as he read their deviant interpretation of Dennett's thinking.  Figments was published shortly after Dennett's Darwin's Dangerous Idea, which effectively refutes much of Cohen and Stewart's thesis.  Dennett uses &quot;cranes,&quot; a more active instrument, instead of &quot;scaffolding&quot; to describe evolution's methods.  Likewise, he nods favourably toward memes as the mechanism of cultural transmission, which Cohen and Stewart ignore completely.  They rely on the mechanism Dennett considers a perversion of Darwinian thought, the &quot;skyhook&quot; to bring humans to an elevated role in the animal kingdom.  Cohen and Stewart are to be commended for their innovative approach and unconstrained imaginations.  Still, this highly readable and provocative book must be balanced with Dennett's more realistic analysis.

1793954:US	50941451	R20W06D4IOJXSE	0393047547	779851838	Sharing the Wealth: Workers and the World Economy	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Backpedaling globalization	Those seeing &quot;globalization&quot; as the promising &quot;wave of the future&quot; for a world economy<br />should give this book their close and undivided attention.  Contrary to the claims of<br />globalization advocates, the &quot;unending prosperity of a world market&quot; may prove a hollow<br />promise.  Kapstein is no anti-globalization crusader, but he sees the fruits of the new economy<br />as tainted, the structure threatened with built-in decay.  The inequitable distribution of global<br />wealth is widening.  With the rich getting richer in this new environment, governments, who<br />can implement controls to distribute the profits, are ignoring the populace at large.  Policy<br />making is being driven by controllers of mobile capital.  Workers' wages and conditions are<br />being driven steadily downward as nations strive to entice those investments across their<br />borders.  Kapstein doesn't see worker uprisings or international strife resulting from these<br />conditions.  He sees the potential collapse of the system with little or nothing foreseeable to<br />replace it.<br />Nearly half the book is taken up with a summary history of centuries of economic thinking.<br />From Adam Smith through the formation of the British Empire, a form of global economy was<br />building.  Governments adhered to the &quot;gold standard&quot; a financial policy inherently<br />restrictive to labour.  Destroyed by World War I, the global economy based on the gold<br />standard struggled for existence until the next conflict set the stage for emergence in a new<br />form.  Kapstein contends the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference laid the foundation for today's<br />global market economy.  Spurred by the Marshall Plan's stimulus from recovery there<br />emerged a world trading programme.  The &quot;German and Japanese  miracles&quot; resulted along<br />with America's economic dominance.  A discordant note, not perceived at the time was<br />Britain's insistence on a full employment element in the planning.  Only the United States<br />rejected this ideal, but the full impact of this new form of isolationism hasn't been perceived<br />until now.<br />Labour isn't described as particularly suppressed in this book, but workers have suffered<br />from poorly considered or indifferent policies.  The world conflicts of the 20th Century nearly<br />led to more equitable attitudes toward labour by the victorious powers, but progress was<br />blocked by the single biggest player in the game.  The U.S. became the chief obstructer of<br />achieving &quot;full employment&quot; policies during the era of recovery from World War II.  With the<br />U.S. being the biggest investor in the new world economy, it set the standards other nations<br />had to follow in order to stay competitive.  The result is a working environment in which the<br />worker poverty level  is set at one dollar per day.  And the poorest people are workers.<br />Kapstein asserts globalization is a political, not economic phenomenon.  The old saw that<br />government should &quot;stay out of business&quot; is clearly false since it is government policies that<br />have allowed or encouraged the growth of a global economy.  Governments, therefore, have<br />the responsibility to ensure workers gain benefits more in line with their contribution.  Public<br />policies should ensure social welfare is an essential part of the new economy.  This can only<br />be accomplished, of course, if governments are driven by their constituents to action.  That<br />means you, the readers of this book.<br />Kapstein's solutions are neither drastic nor terribly innovative.  They simply haven't been<br />implemented on the scale necessary to grant workers a fair share of globalization's benefits.<br />He urges greater focus on &quot;socially responsible firms.&quot;  In short, ethical investment and<br />consumption.  More watchdog groups reviewing government and corporation policy<br />development and implementation should be formed - on the lines of current NGOs.  Worker<br />training should be improved or implemented.  Military training programmes provide a good<br />model for technical training techniques.  Protectionism and immigration policies are overly<br />rigid and need to be more flexible to meet changing needs and conditions.  Policy-making<br />should focus away from purely national outlook and adopt a truly international framework.<br />For example, trade liberalization must be accompanied by proper labour standards with<br />adequate compensation for workers.  These are not pipe dreams, but viable proposals for any<br />governments to consider.  The starting point for putting such policies in place is you.e formed - on the lines of current NGOs.

Like some others in the field, his technical background leads him to focus on the amazing gains made in computing in recent years.  The background doesn't obscure his ability to formulate and present his forecast of where these gains will lead us in a few years.  He's lucid, strongly convincing and precise in why he believes what he does.<br />He opens by comparing the evolutionary rates of  biological and computational change.  From this contrast, he sees computers as achieving human mind processing levels in but a few years.  Unlike most writers in this genre, Kurzweil bravely sets down a detailed time line of benchmarks indicating when we should expect each advance with its likely impact.  In order to help readers comprehend his portentous scenarios, he provides reader/writer dialogs at the end of each chapter.  An innovative step, these exchanges state likely questions readers are considering while reflecting on his ideas.  These FAQ sessions offset some of the technical descriptions.  Those of you with children should look carefully at his proposals while wondering where your offspring will fit into his scenarios.  It is, after all, the reason the book's been written.<br />The focus is the human mind.  How does it process and store information?  The mind uses parallel processing and is slower than the high speed serial algorithm method computers use.  With even faster processing, coupled with enhanced interactivity, computers will easily match the human brain.  Then what?  Kurzweil sees the mind and the computer subtly merging until what is computer and what is human becomes blurred.  Physical events, for example, are reflected in our memories.  Experience is what the mind remembers of it and can be recalled, imitated or created at will.  In Kurzweil's predictions, even at long distance.<br />In another context, this would be considered speculative fiction.  Here, it's done with sound technical assessment, carrying extra validity thereby.  There's little to fault in Kurzweil's presentation of future progress in computing or even whether there's likely to be a merging of computers and minds.  What is lacking here is breadth of outlook.  Kurzweil would have done better to collaborate with a biologist or social thinker.  The future he outlines is purely the product of the technical world.  While the future scenarios he conceives are perfectly valid for those able to implement them, the number of likely affected people is drastically smaller than his book conveys.  While changes in perception of art, music, poetry, even prose writing are, as he states, already taking place, they will not be universal.  A large part of the planet will be bypassed in this transformation.  In his future scenarios he considers what changes will occur in the prosecution of war.  Who will the enemy be?  In all likelihood, those who've been left out of the changes.<br />What will the changes be in human character?  His discussion of the technological Luddites is comprehensive, an often overlooked aspect of considering these changes.  Yet even they are an integral part of this society, not those left outside its sphere.  He suggests the human body as we know it will become superfluous.  That will be true only for those willing or able to  undertake the change.  The rest of us, today's humans, will become Mostly Original Substrate Humans [MOSH].  This suggests a divided society, humans and merges.  Is this division likely to result in new species?  Kurzweil doesn't address this question, but it's one requiring serious discussion.iction.

He introduces<br />us to some bizarre afflictions.  The nature of these illness isn't unusual, but the circumstances<br />on these archipelagoes is bizarre.  The cause and mechanism of spread is revealed by none of<br />the investigations they've been subjected to up to now.  Genetics, nutritional practices, habitat<br />have all been subject to scrutiny.  None have imparted clear root causes for the colour<br />blindness on Pingelap/Pohnpei or nervous disorders on Guam.  Both disorders,<br />achromotopia and lytico-bodig are types of afflictions Sacks has dealt with during his years in<br />practice.  Both have varying manifestations, making diagnosis difficult.  The colour blindness<br />carries other symptoms, sensitivity to bright light and loss of acuity.  Reading may be difficult<br />for some ailing victims.  The lytico-bodig on Guam is particularly difficult, since the<br />symptoms may not become apparent for generations.  Sacks joins local doctors in examining<br />the patients and recounting the research.<br />In assessing the symptoms and the environments, Sacks also conveys a sensitive rendering of<br />the islands' histories and current situations.  Whalers, missionaries and the U.S. Navy have<br />brought plagues, displaced the inhabitants and ignored their impacts.  Indigenous<br />populations have been decimated by diseases introduced  by Europeans and North<br />Americans.  It's an old, wearying story, but it must be told with honesty and perception.<br />Sacks does just that, with deep human feeling that makes this book captivating reading.<br />There's few things as frightening as a latent illness that seems to strike at whim.  Since &quot;bugs&quot;<br />or even genetic origins aren't easily discerned in these cases, it makes the physician's task that<br />much more exacting.  Sacks keeps the reader at his side with finesse as he tours the islands,<br />examines the suffering and describes the efforts to counter the misery.  It's a call for others to<br />take up the challenge, and he offers tools in the massive notes and bibliography.  It's a<br />challenge worth pursuing.

Journeys<br />known as Grand Tours led tourists to take ship to the Continent.  They fanned out across the<br />landscape with the intent to &quot;know Europe.&quot;  Their return home resulted in a flurry of<br />published accounts.  Twain satirizes both the tourists and their writings with delicious<br />wit.  Ever a man to play with words, his &quot;tramp&quot; refers to both himself and the walking tour<br />of Europe he purports to have made.  By the time you've reached the end of the account of the<br />&quot;walking tour&quot; incorporating trains, carriages and barges, you realize that the longest &quot;walk&quot;<br />Twain took occurred in dark hotel room while trying to find his bed.  He claims to have<br />covered 47 miles wandering around the room.<br />Twain was interested in everything, probing into both well-known and obscure topics.  His<br />judgments are vividly conveyed in this book, standing in marked contrast to his more<br />reserved approach in Innocents Abroad.  A delightful overview of mid-19th Century Europe,<br />Tramp is also interlaced with entertaining asides.  Twain was deeply interested in people, and<br />various &quot;types&quot; are drawn from his piercing gaze, rendered with acerbic wit.  Some of these<br />are contemporary, while others are dredged from his memories of the California mines and<br />other journeys.  He also relished Nature's marvels, recounting his observations.  A favourite<br />essay is &quot;What Stumped the Blue-jays.&quot;  A nearly universal bird in North America, Twain's<br />description of the jay's curiosity and expressive ability stands unmatched.  He observes such<br />humble creatures as ants, Alpine chamois, and the American tourist.  Few escape his<br />perception or his scathing wit.

He doesn't simply interview the field workers, but joins the digs, suffering the dust, storms, bugs and labour alongside the scientists.  He maintains his sense of humour, however.  The result is a highly readable book on the paleontologist's work.<br />The idea that the dinosaurs escaped extinction 65 million years ago, surviving in the form of birds has been a major point of discussion among scientists during the past few years.  We follow Grady on his journey from Patagonia through China to the Alberta badlands in revealing much of the new evidence touching on that question.  In the course of that trek he introduces us to a gallery of field researchers dealing with that and other uestions about life in the remote past. Grady's focal point is Canadian paleontologist Phil Currie.  Currie, a man who long ago might have escaped the rigors of field research for a quiet laboratory, remains captivated by digs, with their constant surprises and revelations.  Grady is gratified to see Currie stay Canadian, increasing attention to the high level of this science being done here.  Canada's fossil record has been handled poorly, from indifference by Ottawa to being scavenged by the Americans.  We've lost too many good researchers, as Grady points out.  His book goes a long way to restoring Canada's place in paleontology.<br />Grady's account of the work of a field paleontologist is a very human tale.  Given that he's a writer rather than a professional bone hunter, this is no mean feat.  We are shown the ordeals and triumphs fieldwork provides.  It's hard, demanding work, requiring some special skills. Beyond the question of endurance is the ability to focus your mind on what you seek in order that your eyes will isolate it from the surrounding rock.  It isn't just luck that turns up fossils.<br />If there's a shortcoming to this book, it's the lack of further presentation on the issue of dinosaurs becoming birds.  While it's gratifying that Grady emphasizes Canadian scientists, he completely overlooks the contribution to the evolutionary links of dinosaurs and birds made by Robert Bakker.  Bakker's mentor, John Ostrom, receives a scattering of passing mention, but Bakker's studies are far too important to ignore.  Even a footnote would have redeemed this issue.

Widely imitated but never equaled, his perception and wit gave him mastery over nearly every topic. Although derided for it in his own time, his stature derives from his audience: he wrote for everyone, excluding none. Those who know Twain will find this collection a decorative capstone to works published a century ago. Nearly every work of social commentary [and few of his works miss that definition] touched on the topics presented here. But he harboured deeper feelings on many subjects, particularly the sham of Christianity, noting them down and hiding them away. Two world wars and world depression shattered many illusions and changed attitudes. Finally, this wonderful collection was released to be joyfully received by Twain fans. One can only wonder what he would have thought of the reaction.<br />The commonalty among the essays is man's place in the universe. The title is invoked in a series of letters from a banished archangel. It's a cold-water bath for the new Twain reader. How many Christians have truly considered what awaits them in their &quot;heaven&quot;? An earlier essay, Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven suggested Twain's thinking on the subject, but the Letters From the Earth is a raw inquiry into what environment &quot;paradise&quot; holds for the unthinking. Other aspects of Biblical teachings are covered in the Papers of the Adams Family. What society developed in those centuries between Genesis and The Deluge? Twain surveys the vagaries of his contemporary scene and projects them backward to that early age. It's an hilarious review of human frailty well suited to modern outlook. It's also a cry from heart at the realization of little humans change over time.<br />It's noteworthy that Twain would notice Alfred Russell Wallace, who produced a nearly identical theory of evolution to Charles Darwin's. Darwin would have secretly admired the essays comprising The Damned Human Race. After a gentle acknowledgment to Wallace's suggestion that the heavens and earth were purposely designed for man, Twain utterly demolishes the idea. That he used evidence only beginning to be understood is a tribute to his genius. The essay should be read by every churchgoer [and not a few science teachers] living today. The clarity of his logic, presented with the wit only Twain could present, makes this subset one of the highlights of the book.<br />Twain remained interested in everything he encountered in his lifetime. He maintained a fine balance between castigating unsupported revelations and applauding scientific progress. The Great Dark is a venture into the microscopic world through the mechanism of a dream. The dreamer is drawn into a droplet of water, sailing an endless ocean with his family and the crew of an unsuspecting ship. It's a tale that worthy of comparison with any fantasy of Jules Verne.<br />Why there are so few reviews of this book here is disturbing. More people need to read this collection and understand its importance and value. Twain was North America's greatest Renaissance Man. He traveled the planet, observed and assessed with insight and precision. Nothing he wrote is obscure and little of his work is outdated. Take yourself beyond the boyhood memories of Tom Sawyer and the horrible film productions of his writings. Meet the man at his honest best in this book.

His temporal reach carries today's people into logical extensions of<br />society into a world where the growth of today's technology is likely to confront them.  Idoru<br />is a superior example of Gibson's talent in making the projections he's rightly noted for.  Like<br />all his best work, technology here is present, but it's the characters, their outlook and dealing<br />with events, that chains the reader's attention.  Don't expect dashing heroes, attendant ladies,<br />stygian villains performing in ways to divert you from reality.  Gibson brings tomorrow's<br />realities to his pages, realities you may be facing in your lifetime.<br />The pivotal element is the desire of a rock star to marry a hologram.  Idoru is an electronic<br />construct, the symbol of universal desires.  She, too, is an entertainer, a &quot;synthespian&quot; in future<br />Hollywood jargon.  The term is pure Gibson, projecting today's fascination with special effects<br />and animation supplemented films.  Colin Laney, who bears special analysis skills has been<br />hired to search the data streams to determine the reasons for this unusual liaison.  It's a<br />daunting task, and Gibson provides us many glimpses of our future while guiding Laney<br />through the corporate entertainment world.<br />Laney also carries a dark secret, the suicide of a woman whose data he was tracking.  She had<br />perceived his observing her and he's concerned about who else might be detecting his surveys<br />of information.  His talent had always enjoyed anonymity.  If Alison Shires could detect his<br />intrusion, who else more powerful might also be watching?  The idoru, whose visible<br />projection Laney assesses as the &quot;tip of the iceberg of an Antarctica of information&quot; evokes<br />fears of what powers may lie behind the projected image.<br />Most of the story takes place in New Tokyo, a rebuild of the city destroyed by the Great<br />'Quake which, have no doubt, is certain to come.  Here, Gibson engages in subtle forecasts of<br />how today's technologies will unfold in many ways over the next few decades.<br />Buildings will result from enhanced forms of biotechnology enabling them to &quot;grow&quot; instead<br />of being constructed.  Even something as mundane as sewage treatement receives his<br />attention in taking his characters through their world.  Your world, tomorrow.  Take note of<br />how Gibson forecasts it as the story unfolds.  Any one of you might be tomorrow's Laney, Chia<br />or even a model for the Idoru.  It bears thinking about, but only if you read Gibson's<br />captivating prose on what the future might hold for us all.ost of the story takes place in New Tokyo, a rebuild of the city destroyed by the Great <BR>'Quake which, have no doubt, is certain to come.

What has been the role of women in history and culture.  How influential have women been in creating cultural norms?  What role have women played in spiritual development, language capability, establishment of community and government?  Eisler contends that a partnership of genders, formed in Neolithic times and carried through nascent Mediterranean civilizations, was usurped by male dominant invaders.  To Eisler, The Chalice represents women's values of sharing and nurturing.  The Blade, of course, is the symbol of war and male dominance through conquest, both of civilizations and of women.  She concludes that while male domination has a long history, efforts are being made to overcome The Blade mythology and that The Chalice ideal can be restored and gender \\"partnership\\" can be reasserted.  It's a captivating thesis, deserving further attention.<br /><br />Eisler sees Neolithic society functioning in a spiritual Environment governed by The Goddess.  Using this term as a universal, much in the way European historians use \\"God\\" in referring to any unnamed deity, she contends this spirit guided all early Mediterranean and European peoples.  Feminine values held equal stature with [undefined] male values.  It isn't clear whether men worshipped The Goddess or their own pantheon.  She stresses that worship of The Goddess need not result in matriarchy.  Eisler turns to Minoan Crete as the finest example of the \\"partnership\\" ideal.  As archeologists uncovered the Minoan civilization, their astonishment at its grandeur grew.  The discovery of unexpectedly high levels of technology without associated expansionist tendencies Eisler views as typifying what she later terms a \\"gylanic\\" society.  Cooperation in the domestic environment obviated development of imperialist ambitions.<br /><br />The real culprits in this scenario are two invading peoples, the Kurgans and the Hebrews.  Invading the Mediterranean from northeast and south, they overran many cultures, transforming them utterly and imparting a new social order.  Male dominated and driven by a passion for conquest, they imposed The Blade as a new social norm.  War became the highest accomplishment, with male domination an enduring social result.  A whole new mythology was established with part of the story being the subjugation of women, domestic or conquered.  We are operating under that mythology today, she insists.<br /><br />As Eisler progresses from ancient to modern times, her tone becomes more strident, moving from research to propaganda.  She admits early in the book that she's utilizing a method known as \\"active research\\" which re-examines historical and archeological data to fit her scenario.  This, of course, is fraught with pitfalls, and she stumbles into several.  The universality of her Goddess throughout the Neolithic world has no basis in evidence.  She scorns the Willendorf \\"Venus\\" figurines, but avoids altogether the various cave painting sites predating them.  Nearly all the human figures in those paintings are hunters; none appear to be female.  While Minoan civilization did surprise many, there's not a shred of evidence to indicate male-female \\"partnership\\" as its basis.  The weren't expansionist, but it's just as likely that it was deemed unnecessary or too costly.  It is far more likely Minoan civilization arose from people fleeing other invaders and finding Crete a sanctuary.  Perhaps her gravest misinterpretation arises as she tries to come to grips with the rise of Christianity.  She sees the Madonna as a continuation of The Goddess ideal.  Claiming the Roman Saturnalia, adopted by Christians as the Messiah's birthday, succeeded because that holiday was special to The Goddess.  Saturn was a god of agriculture and patron of clan elders who imparted the wisdom of experience over winter fires.  Any goddesses who were revered during the Solstice simply gainedattention from the universality of the holiday.<br /><br />Eisler's errors result from zealousness and a narrow view.  Two major factors erode her credibility.  One is her focus on the Mediterranean scene.  She fails utterly to take into account other peoples around the world, where male domination is common, if not prevalent.  This widespread circumstance suggests a deeper root for human social structure.  However, like so many feminist writers, Eisler shares their abhorrence of biological foundations for gender differences.  E. O. Wilson, a favourite target of feminist writers since his 1975 publication of Sociobiology, garners no mention in the text.  He rates but a lengthy and disparaging footnote at the back of the book.  Yet even when Eisler was composing this book, zoology and molecular genetics were already forcing grudging recognition of sociobiology's value in human studies.  More recent research is confirming Wilson's early ideas.<br /><br />Eisler's book has worth in seeking to break the militaristic and male domination mythology we live under.  That her evidence is suspect doesn't devalue her desire to replace that social framework with greater emphasis on nurturing and sharing.  If these values were given more emphasis in education, she contends, it would go far to reducing our injurious attitude toward the environment.  She portrays advocates of The Goddess as recognizing the cyclic pattern of nature in contrast to the linear and destructive force of \\"progress.\\"  It's an admirable cause, written with clarity, but hollow in foundation.

The characters ARE the story, and are drawn from life.  They are the result of<br />Theroux's many travels, encountering and recording people.  The portrayal of the &quot;writer&quot;<br />telling the story is, in large part, autobiographical.  If Theroux mixed and matched his<br />characters and events, that is a writer's licence for keeping the reader engaged in his theme.<br />For the theme of this series of short tales is life.  Using the image of a &quot;decomposing writer,&quot;<br />he's transformed into a manager of an off-beat hotel while suffering the loss of his muse.  The<br />muse has not truly deserted him, nor us, as he records the lives of guests, family, other staff<br />and local residents.  Theroux is an avid listener to &quot;the coarse language of life.&quot;  He listens<br />well, conveying what he gleans with unsurpassed vividness.  He may not be composing a<br />novel from what he learns, but he tells us what they imparted.  We are watching their<br />existence through his eyes.  The view is distorted little, if at all.<br />Theroux's travels have brought him to understand life isn't a finished work.  There's no<br />discernible plot line, simply a series of episodes from birth to the end.  Many of the events<br />bear no apparent meaning, but they all add up to an individual's history.  That's how he's<br />constructed this book.  Those who complain that the plot line is thin need only look in the<br />nearest mirror.  Any one of us could be a character here, with notable exception.  Nearly all<br />the people the &quot;writer&quot; encounters are astonished to discover his trade.  Few however, if any<br />of them, read.  His distress at this discovery is apparent, but while it diminishes the narrator,<br />none of the characters feels they've missed anything.  They are getting on with other things -<br />their own lives, as inadequate as we may judge that life to be.<br />There are too many characters in this book to record here.  One of the most endearing is the<br />barman Tran, a refugee, and one time boat person.  His patience compels our attention and is<br />matched only by his sense of irony.  Buddy Hamstra, the hotel's owner, becomes the pivot for<br />many of the story's populace.  Theroux returns to Buddy throughout the book, a sun-like<br />presence around which many of the others orbit.  He's despised and adored with equal<br />weight depending on the relation he's established with them.  He, too, hates and loves with<br />fierce intensity.  But his impact on them and the writer is unquestionable.

The idea of human origins in Eurasia has been long displaced.  Not only is it clear that<br />our beginnings are in Africa, as Darwin suggested, but for many years the birthing site was<br />considered to be the Rift Valley.  Just when view appeared to be well established, along comes<br />this Georgia rebel relocating our origins to southern Africa.  Not satisfied with a geographical<br />disruption, he snaps branches from the conceived evolutionary tree.  He builds a convincing<br />case with smooth assurance.  We might be sitting on that beach on the African coast where<br />&quot;Eve's&quot; footprints were found, listening to him relate their importance in a bigger picture.<br />He's a fine story teller.  There are few flaws in this book, although some aspects are<br />disconcerting.<br />The popular press, in dealing with anthropology, seems unable to shun the term &quot;missing<br />link.&quot;  As a result, we continue to view each new fossil as filling some niche in a line stretching<br />back from me to some barely upright savannah dweller.  Berger wants to dispel this fallacy,<br />becoming our tour guide in the field and workroom as we examine evidence.  He takes us<br />through the history of 20th century paleoanthropology, beginning with Raymond Dart's<br />isolated South African Taung fossil.  Originally spurned by British academics, Dart's chief<br />advocate is one of the most colourful characters in the field, Robert Broom.  In post-war<br />eastern Africa, first the Leakeys, then Don Johanson's Lucy brought fresh assessments of the<br />human family tree.  Dating the fossil was the key issue - if you can accurately date the fossil,<br />you can place it in the human lineage with some accuracy.  South African paleochronology,<br />however, is shown to be a dicey support.  The fossils are often better, but their place in time is<br />easily, and readily, challenged.<br />Continuous disputes over dating and body plans due to inadequate evidence kept resolution<br />of these academic controversies unattainable.  Berger's own analysis of hominid body<br />structure offers a solution.  Johanson's Lucy, with her human-like proportions is pushed out<br />of the linear family tree with southern African progenitors assuming her place.  Berger does<br />this skillfully, showing how arm/leg length ratios provide the key.  His position is convincing<br />enough for most of us, but not sufficient for those with a stake in the consensus view.  Tim<br />White [the Great White Shark], once considered a hero for deserting the Leakeys for<br />Johanson, appears here as a modern Torquemada directing an Inquisition against this<br />relocated Georgian.<br />Consensus, particularly in paleoanthropology, is a moving target, as Berger reminds us.<br />Whether Berger's analysis of the human lineage achieves a new consensus remains to be seen.<br />His proposal, which still rankles many, is that there are many branches in the tree, but many<br />of them proved sterile, producing no further offshoots.  The picture left us is confusing, but<br />likely accurate.  Berger's use of the term &quot;thornbush&quot; is innovative, imparting his comfort with<br />his adopted country.  More importantly, it shows how inappropriate simplistic thinking is<br />when considering evolutionary processes.<br />While Berger was revising the human family tree, his own academic nest hosted a cowbird.  A<br />measure of Berger's qualities is his succession to the post held by Phillip Tobias, one of the<br />pre-eminent figures in the discipline, at Witwatersrand University.  Along with seeking funds<br />and other administrative duties, he fell foul of one the major figures in the field, Ron Clarke.<br />Clarke, whose career at Wits can only be labeled checkered.  Berger's tale of his dealings with<br />Clarke and Tobias can only be called sordid.  In abook of this nature, it's almost embarrassing<br />reading.  A little search on the Web will bring up the relevant South African newspaper<br />accounts of the fray.  The story has relevance, however, in buttressing Berger's role of South<br />Africa as humanity's point of origin.<br />It's not an academic exercise to read this, although another encounter with the term<br />&quot;postcranial&quot; may leave this reviewer gibbering.  When an author starts rolling &quot;curved lateral<br />condoyles&quot; and &quot;rounded semi-membranous detachments&quot; in tibias [knee bones] past the reader,<br />it's time for some diagrams.  Berger's target for this book seems as much his professional, and<br />distant, colleagues as it is for the rest of us.  We're unlikely to challenge his conclusions, since<br />that's in the realm of the professional journals.  His text is clear and informative.

His travels in that mysterious realm result in this<br />masterfully done account of journeys in Patagonia - southern Argentina and Chile.  It's not an<br />exaggeration to praise this work as the first to supplement Darwin's.  Both sought fossils,<br />although Chatwin's pursuit is rather more specific.  Both described the land, the people and<br />events in the most captivating and readable manner.  A rare treasure in travel literature, this<br />book is a timeless treasure.<br />Patagonia has been a haven for many European nationalities besides the Spanish.  British,<br />Welsh, Scots and the Germans have found refuge and opportunities here.  Chatwin<br />encounters a wide spectrum of the inhabitants.  By touring on foot, bus and horse, as well as<br />obtaining the occasional lift, he is able to garner intense impressions.  Lacing the account of<br />what he observes with numerous piquant historical side notes, he imparts the place along<br />with the spirit of the residents.  The history varies as the land itself.  Rising from the Atlantic<br />across a vast plain until reaching the rising slopes of the &quot;back&quot; of the Andes, Patagonia offers<br />incredible vistas and diversity.  Decades of building immense rancheros and farms have been<br />punctuated by social and political upheavals.  Chatwin recounts the lives of many of the<br />rebels and how they impacted the pampas scene.  His literary capacity seems as vast as the<br />territory.  We even encounter The Ancient Mariner.  There are no dull moments in this book.<br />Chatwin's presents a more knowledgeable view in discussing aboriginal people than that of<br />most travel writers.  There's nothing patronizing in his tone as he tries to address their plight.<br />&quot;Tries to&quot; because European intrusion has left so little for researchers of indigenous cultures to<br />address.  He cites the expressive terms in the Yamana language to point out how culturally<br />inept the colonizing powers have been.

It's becoming a familiar story, made sadder at the realization the loss of cultures<br />swept away by colonization.<br />At the end, his original quest brings him to a cave visited by Charley Milward, wrecked ship's<br />captain.  He cannot replace the artifact Milward left in Chatwin's grandmother's house, but<br />there is other compensation.  That the quest isn't a failure adds further lustre to an incredible<br />journey.  But what Chatwin has gained is as nothing compared to what he's given us.

A head-spinning tour of thirty-eight states,<br />Bryson whisks us along freeways and back roads at a dizzying.  However brisk, this tour<br />doesn't inhibit Bryson's expressing views on the merit of everything he sees.  Nearly every<br />small community is boring.  The few urban centers he enters are dangerous [in his eyes],<br />confusing and dirty.  National parks or historical sites are crowded with obnoxious,<br />overweight or overage tourists.  In short, this book leaves you with the idea that wherever is<br />home is where you should remain.  In his case, this is Des Moines, Iowa.  To those who have<br />seen Iowa or met Iowans, the proposal has some merit.<br />After a sojourn in Britain, Bryson has [temporarily] returned to the American Midwest to<br />launch a journey of exploration.  To those living elsewhere, the American term &quot;Midwest&quot; is<br />something of a puzzle.  Bryson reinforces the perception of the region being rather &quot;Middle&quot;<br />as he tours various American cities, towns and villages.  The contrast between &quot;small town&quot;<br />and urban America remains as stark as it was in Mencken's day.  &quot;Middle&quot; America appears<br />drab, self-contained, inward looking and static, changing only in details.  The urban scene is<br />rushed, dynamic, perceived dangerous and swamped by consumerism.  The cultural<br />advantages of cities are ignored.  In fact almost the only observation on cultural elements is<br />his failure to find a bookstore in Auburn, Alabama, a college town.<br />Bryson has a keen capacity for observation.  His Iowa roots remain the fundament of his view,<br />but he observes American communities of all sizes with a penetrating eye.  Such a perspective<br />can only be achieved by one who has been elsewhere and retains a receptive outlook.  Having<br />known Midwesterners who traveled the world and seen nothing, his breadth of vision is<br />refreshing.  Imparting his observations with stinging wit, he keeps his readers in keen<br />expectation for the next phase of the journey.  His style encourages you to remain with him as<br />he rapidly moves across the face of the United States.  The pace is hectic - the thoughtful<br />reader may pause to wonder how Bryson can render his judgments with the limited time he<br />remains in each place.  Those seeking more penetrating views of America should be reading<br />histories, not travel accounts.<br />This is a very American view of the world.

Don't expect to fully comprehend where you're going until you're well into his story. Looking at the last pages doesn't help, either. Let him carry you through the story. It's worth the effort. Gibson's characterizations are peerless, even though so many of his people seem outlandish in our perception. His eye for the future is unmatched. Harlan Ellison's dictum that \\"SF\\" means \\"speculative fiction\\" and not \\"science fiction\\" finds its greatest expression in Gibson's works. This book, which became the introduction to a trilogy, is a fine example of all these elements.<br /><br />Berry Rydell was a Tennessee copper. Caught up in bizarre circumstances while \\"protecting the public,\\" he becomes a Cop In Trouble. If policemen today think \\"political correctness\\" has impaired their effectiveness, wait until they see the future Gibson has in store for them. Lawsuits resulting from law enforcement activities are rampant. But the police have support. It comes from media producers who see enhanced viewer capture in publicizing these cases. Who but Gibson could view the corporate mentality with such perception? By the time of this story, corporate America has built up such a web of interfaces between themselves and the world it becomes impossible to extricate them. Rydell views video screens with the question \\"Woman or machine?\\" arising with distressing frequency. Driven from the police force, Rydell takes up with a security firm and relocated to Los Angeles. It's a drastically different world compared to Knoxville, but he hasn't seen anything yet. Before long he's in San Francisco, then off to Texas. Beyond mere survival, which is increasingly problematic, he's seeking a piece of advanced technology - the virtual light glasses. Gibson doesn't dwell on the technology behind this device.  He's more concerned with the forces surrounding its possessor. Why do the questors go to such extremities to recover these glasses? Rydell represents us all. He remains honest while working among those clearly outside the law. But it isn't the individuals who bring such tension into Rydell's life. His stress is ultimately due to the hidden agencies with which he must deal. They are faceless and obscure. They impart information of vague worth with a deviousness a Delphic oracle would envy. He isn't even clear whether he's dealing with individuals or cabals. Lofty and condescending, they give him but little satisfaction and what's given is clearly on their terms alone.<br /><br />It's these faceless entities that Gibson warns us of as he [and we] contemplate the future. Corporate operations are disappearing from view as their powers grow from local to global influence. They can tap growing information resources and their decisions, which impact our lives daily, are taken far removed from our scrutiny. Gibson uses Rydell to exhibit how helpless we're becoming in their grasp. Gibson shows they are subject to no accountability to law or popular review as they make \\"globalization\\" a new reality. We can only watch in awe as they form a new ruling class in world society. That Gibson can do this within the realm of captivating fiction garners our admiration.

However, this book isn't a just pedantic exercise. Her views of the participants impart a sincere personal account of how she views the collision of ideals among scientists. Segerstrale's approach is amazingly dispassionate. Her Introduction, a fine summary of the issues, states that \\"the participants are all defenders of the truth.\\" Their views are adhered to passionately with Segerstrale presenting their assertions openly without comment. Later, when she analyzes their motivations, does background meaning become clear as to why this debate hasn't closed.<br /><br />Sociobiology's path has been pretty bumpy during the generation since E.O. Wilson's book was published. Almost immediately a hue and cry arose from academics and the public alike. Segerstrale carefully presents the views of all the important participants, with special focus on Harvard's Richard Lewontin. It was Lewontin who characterized Wilson's book as \\"bad science\\" without suggesting what \\"good science\\" might be in addressing the issue. Even the \\"scientific traditions\\" of field naturalist versus laboratory experimentalists are examined in the debate's context. Adding to the complexity of personalities and methods is Segerstrale's ongoing discussion of the political status of the period. With race relations, women's issues and other social causes intruding on the scientific debate, the contenders avoid simple pigeonholing. Segerstrale goes to some length in presenting the debate in a broader social context and accomplishes it with finesse.<br /><br />In the final analysis, it is E.O. Wilson who emerges vaguely from the fray with enhanced stature. While his critics appear mildly panic-stricken from the tenets of sociobiology, Wilson continued his work. Publishing several works embellishing his original ideas, he summarized his efforts and much of the debate in his autobiography, Naturalist. Wilson's critics over the years attacked his \\"facts\\" in a \\"utilitarian\\" sense - i.e., what impact does a scientific find have on society. As a field researcher, Wilson found this interpretation of science disquieting. The issue then, wasn't \\"bad science\\" but \\"bad interpretation\\" of scientific results. Segerstrale's analysis of this issue makes compelling reading, bringing the book to a well-structured conclusion. Those wishing to understand what the sociobiology debate [not the science itself] is all about should obtain this book. It's a stunning resource.

Richard Morgan, a Bristol publican's son and Jack-of-many-trades, is caught up in the devious machinations of the British class system. In circumstances exacerbated by economic disruption caused by the American War of Independence, he's convicted of a contrived crime. After spending time in British prisons and hulk ships, he's transported to New South Wales to complete his seven year sentence. Morgan is a gifted survivor. Closed upon himself, he maintains a precarious balance between despair and fatalistic acceptance. It's a narrow path, but he manages it successfully. With close attention to details, McCullough uses Richard's tortuous path to display her research into everything from the details of building the famous British &quot;Brown Bess&quot; musket through convict and guard relations. Morgan's trials and incarcerations give McCullough the canvas to portray the Georgian justice system. It's not a pretty picture, but his prosecution and detentions give the author time to build Morgan's emerging character. The loss of two children and a wife might have left a better man hopelessly melancholic, but McCullough uses the pieces of his shattered life to forge a new, stronger being. With the support received from uncles and unexpected friends, he emerges as an unwilling leader among the convicts. His abilities are recognized in the convict ships and settlements, places where artisans were at a premium. After time in Port Jackson [Sydney], he's sent to Norfolk Island where he truly blossoms. Given Norfolk Island's reputation as a convict hell-hole, this came as something of a surprise. Building on his artisan talents, Morgan's role takes a departure, becoming respected among convicts and marine guards alike. In sum, she paints the image of this man too boldly. His stature stands far above lesser mortals in surroundings where such prominence is unlikely. Many years after this story a debate raged in New South Wales over the status of redeemed convicts. No trace of that issue arises with Morgan, who, as a free man assumes a place in Norfolk society with amazing ease. He establishes a property straddling a stream - Morgan's Run. Writing historical fiction presents numerous problems. To establish firm credibility, there must be a realistic mixing real and fictional characters. Today's writers on the early days of Australia as a convict colony tend to elevate their characters above the normal run of society. They're uniformly innocent or dupes. Just once, i'd like to see a portrayal of a real villain transported to Port Jackson. McCullough follows the path set by many good historical novelists - a treasury of research transcribed into a wealth of information. In unskilled hands, such abundance can overwhelm the reader, erode the characters and subdue the plot line. McCullough is anything but unskilled, but in this book her story line is timid and the  characters only short of stereotyped. Also, her Australian roots led her away from the consensus view of most writing on the convict colony. Not one of the felons expresses a strong desire to return to Britain. The novelty of the land is expressed clearly, but the homesickness most writers convey is lacking here. It's not even fatalism, just indifference. McCullough is a good read and anyone unfamiliar with the circumstances involved with the transportation of convicts will learn much from this book. As the first volume in a series, it's clear her research will bring forth new and entertaining circumstances. Morgan, only forty years of age at the end of this volume, will certainly find new fields to conquer. I look forward to the sequel, more for its information than from any interest in Morgan, who's bigger than life already.issue arises with Morgan, who, as a free man assumes a place in Norfolk society with amazing ease.

Although not the older and simpler &quot;Killer Ape&quot; hypothesis of some years ago, Stanford sees meat hunting and consumption as the foundation of human society. Meat also acted as a basis in developing the resource voracious human brain and associated communication skills we developed. Among those primates who consume meat, its acquisition remains a male-dominated activity. However, instead of resulting in inexorably male-dominating societies, meat distribution and consumption results in complex negotiation patterns in which females play significant, if not equal roles. This concept suggests humans must seriously reassess their role in Nature. Urging that humanity's lineage is far from linear, he presents a good overview of recent studies. Although the number of definitive fossils is meager, they still demonstrate that our primate roots are not in doubt. The struggle by researchers to properly place humans within the larger animal community has been stoutly resisted by many, both scholars and the lay public alike. Feminist anthropologists, in particular, have striven to displace the male dominated academic group with excessive roles of females in various primate cultures. Some have stretched the idea to the point of seeing females as the true source of language, nutritional foods and even tool making. Stanford addresses these suggestions as mostly unrealistic. Instead, he notes how meat plays a major role in mating scenarios, granting females an active role in selection. Acquiring meat may be accomplished through various strategies, from opportunistic scavenging to actively seeking prey. The true hunter, he contends, must develop a sophisticated array of skills in pursuing meat - prey location, stealth, communication, and the tools able to kill and process. Once obtained, the distribution of the kill becomes an essential element in societal arrangement. He reviews many forms social structures have taken, from selfish monopolization of the kill to the hunter himself receiving but limited return for his effort. What the hunter does gain in all societies is respect and recognition of the group. For Stanford, this is but one indication of the diversity encountered in all primate societies, human and otherwise. The only universal is the hierarchical structure resulting from the hunting role. While hierarchy is the norm, dominance doesn't necessarily follow. In this study, Stanford examines the many social structures primates have developed. These range from nearly solitary, such as the orang-utan, to both male-male and male-female bonding strategies. These elements are essential to understanding the roots of human societal structures. As an example, in primate societies, in contrast to many other animals, it is the female who migrates from the natal group. Stanford doesn't follow this to suggest that dowries and bride-bargaining derive from this behavior, but the inference is clear. Indeed, part of the value of this book is his restriction to biological patterns. One need only accept that humans are included in the primate community. Stanford's book may raise some hackles, but it's far too important an idea to dismiss lightly. He's a skilled enough writer not to get bogged down in a pedantic rendition of the evidence or his conclusions. With the large number of works on the vagaries of human evolution appearing in recent years, finding worthwhile books can be a daunting task. Rest assured that The Hunting Apes is worth your attention and investment. Future research may modify it slightly, but is unlikely to supplant it.ietal arrangement.

1863378:US	50941451	R3T420T632YTRQ	0465004199	183083723	Are We Alone?: Philosophical Implications Of The Discovery Of Extraterrestrial Life	Books	2	9	17	N	N	Simple answers to the Big Questions	In this little tome Paul Davies raises the Big Questions : \\"What is life? Where did it come from? Why is it here? How likely is it to be elsewhere?\\" Not an in-depth academic study, the book is the print version of a lecture series. Converting brief lectures into print, however, limits the scope of his answers. Reviewing his efforts in this format means curtailing criticism as well. By taking a \\"philosophical\\" approach, Davies is able to dodge the questions of physical reality. He seems to assume his audience is more at home with philosophy and history than with biology and geology. That may have been the case for the lecture series, but is ill-suited to a discerning reading public. Life isn't a philosophical question, it's a physical one. Davies touches on that reality at times, but edges away cautiously.<br /><br />He defines his topic in the Preface as \\"one of the oldest problems in philosophy.\\" While this would seem to preclude firm scientific issues, the Preface also contends he'll examine \\"the assumptions [of extraterrestrial life] made by the SETI enthusiasts . . . [because they] strike at the very heart of neo-Darwinism [read \\"Richard Dawkins\\"].\\" This is hard science, indeed, but an area where Davies qualifications are limited. Still, he makes a valiant effort within a limited format.<br /><br />Surveying historical thinking on extraterrestrial life, he concludes with the creation of the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence [SETI] project. He presents the famous Urey-Miller demonstration of how easy it is for life to get a leg up in the proper environment. SETI was established on the premise that if life could happen here, it was likely to emerge elsewhere. If so, life was likely to evolve into something intelligent and communicative. The spontaneous generation of amino acids in Harold Urey's lab flask was a major boost to the SETI concept, but based on inadequate knowledge of Earth's early conditions.<br /><br />Davies goes on to state that \\"the origin of life remains a deep mystery.\\" This is typical Davies, subtly dangling an enigma before us as we progress through the lectures. Who best to resolve that Big Question but the winner of the Templeton Prize? The lectures are clearly designed to allow Davies to provide the solution to the Great Mystery at their end. In arriving there, we must flounder through his review of philosophic thought on Man's Place in the Universe. From Copernicus through Christian dogma to the struggle to understand how the human mind works, his focus, as always, is Euro-centric. His \\"universal\\" human qualities include nothing from beyond the Mediterranean.<br /><br />Davies describes Forces in the universe in support of his conclusion. These include elemental atomic forces, the likelihood of \\"spontaneous generation of DNA\\" and the issue of \\"complexity.\\" \\"Complexity,\\" of course, is what brings it all together. And that means us. The human species is, after all, the only one known asking the Big Questions. \\"Complexity\\" in humans expresses his thesis that \\"consciousness is a fundamental feature of the universe\\" resulting from ubiquitous cosmic forces. It's a very human idea, although Davies resolutely avoids the anthropocentric principal that the universe exists because we are in it. He thus merges the scientific quest for ET with the religious pursuit of a universal spirit. He leaves this spirit unnamed, but its universality within his Euro-centric framework leaves few options to consider.<br /><br />If Davies had pursued his research into this topic with more depth, he would have discovered a book with the same title addressing the same subject. Twenty years ago James Trefil and Robert Rood published Are We Alone?: a keen scrutiny of what was then known of life's origins and how likely it would produce intelligence. They closely examined such parameters as available water, the moon's presence to create tidal effects and other factors. Their work has been updated in a new assessment, Rare Earth by Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee. Superbly crafted and presented, Rare Earth makes a fine antidote to Davies' nameless metaphysical \\"forces\\". Read Davies for the questions and Rare Earth for the viable answers. The philosophical questions have no meaning if the physical environment isn't clearly understood. In contrast, Davies' book seems to preach to the converted, offering no serious scientific contribution to the questions of life's beginnings and the evolutionary process.

Almost a sequel, the Idoru trilogy carries forward his ideas of what  the future is likely to hold.  Never a simple read, this book stands out in displaying Gibson's  writing ability and his speculations about tomorrow.  Gibson's talent in portraying a future  world has few peers.  The future looks grim, indeed, depending on your perspective.  In  Gibson's view, the perspective is from below.<br />His characters are people rarely seen in &quot;normal&quot; life, but clearly, they are here among us.  They live out of the &quot;mainstream,&quot; Tokyo subways, landslide ravaged Malibu and the Bay  Bridge.  Gibson has them caught up in events not of their making nor choosing.  They are no  less instrumental in carrying out Gibson's designated roles for all that.  Colin Laney, hidden in  the subway among other indigents, his enhanced senses foretelling coming changes, becomes  the chess master.  He moves distant people as pawns in dealing to deal with a future even he  sees only dimly.  His pawns react to his plays, unable to comprehend his direction, but just as  unable to resist.  Chevette, in particular, becomes a pivot for Laney and Rydell.  She moves  adroitly through the many crises Gibson confronts her with, a strong character who should  give pause to those claiming men can't write about women.<br />As a Westerner, Gibson is sensitive to the power of earthquakes.  Under his discerning  scrutiny, he sees the power of continental drift as modifying not only the landscape, but  society as well.  In this story, tremblors around the whole Pacific Rim have generated social  adjustments.  San Francisco, so vulnerable to earth movements, has given rise to a subculture  on the Bay Bridge after the Big One renders it unsafe to traffic [Interesting that there is no  attempt to restructure the bridge, nor to devise newer forms of transportation.  Gibson's love  of technology is in data streams, not engineering challenges.].  He uses the Bridge as a  backdrop instead of the focus of the whole story, which lesser writers have done.<br />The Bridge becomes a haven for Rydell and Chevette, Laney's most active pawns.  They must  come together because Rydell has the mysterious &quot;thermos&quot; carrying the Idoru.  Rydell is  captivated by the image of &quot;all desires&quot; but why he's carrying her remains a mystery to the  end.  Even when the conclusion arrives, why Laney was so insistent that &quot;everything is going  to change&quot; isn't entirely apparent.  This approach remains the basis of Gibson's genius.  He  refuses to end his tales cleanly, giving his readers much to ponder and contemplate.  If Gibson  isn't the reason Harlan Ellison urged the term &quot;speculative fiction&quot; be substituted for &quot;science  fiction,&quot; he should be.  Reading groups will have much to ponder and discuss over this book.  In the end, none will be correct, and none wrong.

His portrayals of motivation and  value  conflicts find sympathetic responses from readers knowing nothing of the game.<br />Kinsella has dealt often with poignant issues, but the title story in this gathering of fine  writing achieves a summit of excellence.  As an Albertan, he's dealt with Native Peoples,  Ukrainian, Scandinavian and Irish communities, often in the first person.  Here, he adds Japan  to his quiver of cultural portrayals.  Again, baseball only forms a mechanism to depict the  power love exerts over the unwary.  Imagine falling in love with someone you can't converse  with, then come to realize the barrier isn't linguistic.  Craig Bevans goes to Japan to become a  star, but falls in love with &quot;the boss's daughter.&quot;  The formula would be trite in hands other  than Kinsella's - the star manipulating the owner for reward.  Bevans, however, is driven by  love, not ambition, and the ironic end of this story leaves the reader breathless, if not tearful.<br />The prize in this array of vividly crafted relations is The Arbiter.  In any sport, writers focus  on the newsworthy.  American baseball pitchers, managers and strong hitters are social idols  at many levels of both fact and fiction.  Their abilities and their activities are recounted,  assessed with their lives often scrutinized in agonizing detail.  One group of people associated  with any sport, however, are almost universally overlooked.  The Arbiters - the referees,  judges and umpires of any sport, sink into obscurity, relegated to background roles.  In  baseball, the umpire's dark suit melds them into the grassy horizon of the diamond.  Only the  contested call brings them to the fore of our attention.  Once the game is decided, they fade  from view and memory.  Kinsella has retrieved one, vividly bringing him into our view as a  man of enviable values.  In an almost Sophoclean portrayal, Kinsella gives us a man driven to  achieve perfection.  What can challenges to that drive achieve but to erode it?  Kinsella walks  us through The Arbiter's confronting those challenges resulting in a nearly inevitable  response.<br />Those who've read Kinsella will welcome this book as a pinnacle among his achievements.  He's unquestionably a master of the genre.  Some critics have claimed Kinsella shouldn't  depart from short story writing.  If this is Kinsella's response, their carping is surely  vindicated.  There's not a word extra nor any out of place.  If you're new to Kinsella or not a  baseball fan, have no worries; these stories will not leave you wondering what it's all about.  Kinsella's people are identifiable by all of us.  You will find yourself or someone you know in  here without difficulty or distraction.  You will come away wondering why you haven't read  this excellent author before.

A collection of disparate essays is an elusive target for a reviewer.  The range of topics here is  wide and of varying quality.  With essays ranging from IQ testing through the Darwinian  revolution to the Human Genome Project and cloning, Lewontin is able to declaim his own  expertise in whichever subject he approaches.  As with most New York Review of Books  authors, he's witty and cleverly subtle when assaulting those authors or ideas he's contesting;  passionately assertive in support.  When you've finished the review, however, you're often  left with little foundation for deciding whether you should buy that particular book for  yourself.  The usual reaction is wishing to run out and find all the other sources he refers to  for confirming information.<br />The only consistent theme in this compilation is that of the iconoclast.  Chipping away at  perceived flaws in other people is a Lewontin specialty.  He has favoured targets, such as  Richard Dawkins and Philip Rushton, are frequently mentioned.  A glaring omission,  particularly in the updating Epilogue to &quot;Darwin's Revolution&quot;, is that of Daniel C. Dennett's  DARWIN'S DANGEROUS IDEA.  Given Dennett's scathing critique of The Spandrels of San  Marco, co-authored by Lewontin and Stephen Gould, the oversight surprises.<br />The most engaging sections of the book are essays on the Human Genome Project, genetics  and cloning.  In an effort to undercut scientists like E.O. Wilson or Richard Dawkins,  Lewontin attempts to restrict DNA's role to 'the stupid molecule' it was once considered.  Using every verbal trick available, he writes a lawyer's brief against the Project and its  supporters.  Stripping away nearly every function DNA performs and removing it from its  environment, he leaves the reader wondering if 'the stupid molecule' is worth the funding.  Like many others, Lewontin knows The Human Genome Project isn't a scientific enterprise,  but a business one.  He's correct in that assessment, but his hidden agenda remains shrouded.  Lewontin is terrified that once the genome has been mapped and better understood, this  Agassiz Research Professor will discover that human beings aren't the divinely placed species  he and many others would like us to be.  Because he can think about so many esoteric subjects  and salamanders can't [or at least can't express those thoughts], it follows that we're elevated  above the other animals instead of simply different.  Lewontin is a tenured human and  demotion holds no appeal.  He's not alone in that, which is why his books sell.<br />The book needs an index.  There are simply too many topics and names running through this  collection for either Lewontin nor The New York Review to be excused for this lack.  In a time  of electronic word processing the omission is unforgivable.  A bibliography of recommended  readings would also be a benefit.  If he took the trouble to update his opinions, he could have  helped the reader along with supporting information.  Not an approach one would admire in  an academic.but his hidden agenda remains shrouded.

You're sitting here reading this.  Instead of not existing at all.  In this delightful study, Martin Rees describes  the six fundamental cosmic forces with refreshing clarity.  One of these, nuclear efficiency has  a value of .007.  A lower value would result the entire cosmos consisting only of hydrogen: no  carbon to build your body and brain, no oxygen to breathe.  A higher level would have  resulted in rapid stellar evolution and decay leaving no time for life to evolve.<br />The image of the astronomer, especially the Astronomer Royal, locked away in an  observatory, immune to human feelings and capacities is dashed forever by this book.  Rees  portrays the &quot;deep forces that shaped the universe&quot; without sinking into a pedantic morass.  No arcane mathematics or arcane cosmology in this book.  Rees takes us on a journey through  space and time with examples of atomic forces, gravity, cosmic structure and why we live in a  three dimensional universe.  He shows how these forces interact and why they are important  to us.<br />The human value of the study of cosmology permeates this excellent presentation.  Cosmology is &quot;stellar paleontology.&quot;  As telescopes have improved we are observing the  radiation of light and other forces that was emitted from shining object many billions of years  ago.  Recording and analyzing these forces has built up an image allowing us to assess how  the cosmos began.  Rees takes us through the instruments and techniques what the images tell  us.  He builds an enthralling picture, never failing to demonstrate why it's important that we  all understand it.  Where it's confusing or indistinct, he manages to bring clarity and wit.  Most importantly, he asserts why these are physical quantities and not the result of divine  interaction.  The &quot;creator&quot; thesis has esthetic appeal, he admits, but divinities reduce the study  of physics to an absurdity.  Why learn about these forces and their origins if it's only to result  in a &quot;divine plan?&quot;  It's too easy an answer, in Rees' view.  The fine balance of cosmic forces  should lead us to learn more, not be satisfied with metaphysical platitudes.<br />He also engages in some speculation about what else the cosmos might reveal.  His  conclusion, that there might be &quot;multiverses&quot; instead of the solitary one we inhabit is based on  good logic results from his discussion of the Big Bang.  We can see only so far back in time.  We can't &quot;see&quot; either the Big Bang nor objects such as black holes.  Both these phenomena  stretch the limits of today's physics.  Yet we can infer their existence from what we can see  and extrapolate from other evidence.  Since a single cosmos is likely illogical, the concept of  multiple universes must be given serious thought.  Bigger and more sensitive telescopes may  someday allow us to perceive these entities.  It's not a subject we should dismiss out of hand.<br />In short, this is a book for anyone wishing to understand how the universe came to be and  our place in its existence.  Rees carries his theme with precision in a deftly structured  framework.  He brings many years of experience to present this summation to us.  He's to be  applauded for a vivid portrayal of what might otherwise be a daunting topic.ins if it's only to result  in a &quot;divine plan?&quot;  It's too easy an answer, in Rees' view.

If you want a clear, succinct outline of all the forces involved in traversing life's tortured  course, you have it here.  What is the likelihood another world possesses all the factors  needed to drive simple molecules along a track leading to a creature capable of thinking about  communicating across vast stellar distances?  In dealing with this question, Ward and  Brownlee synthesized an immense amount of information, presenting it in a finely crafted  style.  In fact, the extraterrestrial aspects become relegated to short pieces at chapters' ends.  Leaving no stone unturned, the authors deal with cosmology, physics, chemistry and, of  course, biology, in easily absorbed prose.  Given the wealth of information they needed to  survey, no accolade can do sufficient justice to their presentation.<br />Nearly twenty years ago, James Trefil and Robert Rood published &quot;Are We Alone?&quot;.  From a  list of then-known conditions needed to allow life to begin and evolve, the authors offered  optimistic and pessimistic scenarios on whether alien civilizations were likely to exist.  Ward  and Brownlee have improved the resolution of this question, using the latest information.  Sadly, but almost certainly correctly, the come down strongly on the pessimistic side.<br />Paleontology has come far since Are We Alone? was published.  Ward and Brownlee's  account surveys utilizes the wealth of recent information derived from research studies done  during the past few years.  With life beginning over 3 thousand million years ago, their task is  formidable.  Yet they carry us through the stages life without bogging down in pedantic  expression.  They show how misleading simple pictures of life's progress can be, showing  how even &quot;simple&quot; creatures are astonishingly complex.<br />The studies and researchers they discuss offer a wealth of new information, including a few  acute surprises.  Evolution is fraught with disaster scenarios.  Ward and Brownlee offer a  good discussion of these, particularly the great Permian dying.  Diversity loss from this  extinction was severe.  Was it the result of a reduction in available DNA patterns due to the  loss of species?  This is a new question for which the authors call for further research in its  response.<br />The most innovative chapter in the book deals with the impact of plate tectonics on evolution.  More than simply the drifting of continental land masses, the authors describe how severely  mobile continents impact ocean currents, air masses and climate generally.  Little considered  by paleontologists except as a dating and location device, Ward and Brownlee make  continental drift a major factor in evolution.  Since no other planet in the solar system exhibits  tectonic activity, what is the likelihood this phenomenon occurs on planets circling distant  stars?  No tectonics, no stimulus to higher life forms and interplanetary communication.<br />In short, this book covers an immense amount of territory in explaining how life starts and  likely continues under the proper conditions.  They present nicely balanced explanations and  critiques of recent research findings.  Even outlandish ideas are given a patient hearing.  As  they remind us, who would have thought life could dwell at the bottom of the ocean's depths?  It's well worth investing in this view of life's history.  While posing many questions, the  authors show how innovative thinking may someday provide answers .  Anyone considering  entering a scientific field will discover countless areas of investigation.

Approaching this book with some trepidation, it proved a surprisingly good read.  Davies is a lucid writer, adroit with words and descriptions.  His 'chatty' approach brings the reader to his way of thinking with deceptive ease.  He even provides an impressive chapter on the Second Law of Thermodynamics, a daunting topic at any time.  Describing how the Second Law should be properly addressed in the biological realm, the chapter is a quiver of arrows effectively countering the anti-Darwinists who cite the Law in refuting evolution by natural selection.  He also manages to explain, as no-one else has done, how we know certain meteorites originated on Mars.  All this fine work is undermined by his conclusion.  The title, of course, gives the game away.  If you don't know what the other four miracles are, you have to read his Preface.  Or his source.<br />Davies opens by expressing his disappointment with &quot;science&quot; not having &quot;wrapped up the mysteries of life's origins.&quot;  He doesn't make clear why he held this opinion, claiming to have spent &quot;a year or two researching the topic.&quot;  He then summarizes the various theories offered on life's origins ranging from Darwin's &quot;warm little pond&quot; through Urey and Miller's laboratory generation of amino acids to Graham Cairns Smith's crystalline model of molecular replication.  Each little digest of various research efforts are closed with Davies carefully dismantling each result as failing to provide the answer he seeks.  Davies is not alone in his dissatisfaction.  The numerous concepts offered on life's origins suggests how vital this question remains throughout the realm of science.  It's not surprising that he finds a near solution in the &quot;replicating molecule&quot; attached to growing crystals first proposed by Graham Cairns Smith.  This idea has the advantage of showing how organic life superceded simple chemical organizations.  For Davies, it has the added benefit of being applicable to any place in the universe where conditions permit such organization and replication to occur.<br />Davies eschews mainstream expressions about divine origins for life.  In its quest, even in Davies' critical eye, science has shown that simplistic metaphysical answers are no answer at all.  Evolution is an accepted fact, as is the Big Bang.  The mechanism of evolution by natural selection, which Davies insists on shortcutting to &quot;Darwinism&quot;, is, in the words of Dobzhansky, &quot;the answer to all complex questions about life.&quot;  Except one: how did it start?  Davies is a bit heavy-handed in scoffing at science's failure to solve this quest.  Throughout the book he portrays scientists &quot;scratching their heads&quot; or &quot;wringing their hands&quot;, actions scientists actually engage in only when suffering from dandruff or washing up for dinner.  Scientists probe for answers, they don't throw up their hands in despair when research fails to provide explanations to their questions.  They try again.  In the final analysis, Davies is hugely unjust to the scientific community.  He owes many colleagues in biology and related fields a humble apology.  Scenarios of the early conditions of Earth's environment are still undergoing revision.  He dismisses the work of Urey and Miller by showing their concept of our planet's early atmosphere has been replaced by new theses.  That's how science moves along.  If we don't have an answer for life's origins yet, then it may come from further work.  Since we can't duplicate the conditions, we may never find that answer.<br />Davies' own solution, after guiding us through a litany of science's failures, boils down to the reason he's the winner of the Templeton Prize.  In the Preface, he wants to fit life, particularly human life, into a 'grand scheme'.  This 'grand scheme' accepts the idea that life will emerge anywhere in the universe when conditions permit.  We live, therefore, in a &quot;universe of information.&quot;  Contending that the laws of physical and chemical operations are too simple and general to produce life, some information source must have brought about a new level of organization.  Darwin's concluded The Origin of Species with the comment, &quot;light will be thrown on the origin of man,&quot; a statement imbued with meaning.  Davies' own concluding words, that we live in &quot;a universe in which we are not alone&quot; is no less meaningful.  He leaves mooted what the implications of this universal information source might be.  However, his vivid depictions of &quot;baffled&quot; scientists failing to discover the origins of life leave few options.

2020022:US	50941451	R1EEZZDO3E2473	0465038107	482648205	Evolution's Workshop: God And Science On The Galapagos Islands	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Where it all began . . .	Edward Larson's chronicle of the explorers and scientists visiting the lonely archipelago of the  Galapagos America is a treasure.  He conveys his knowledge of its visitors, its legends and its  place in the world with matchless skill.  This book merits a respected place in any library of  science and exploration.<br />Once viewed as a glimpse of Hell, the Galapagos was later transformed as the place best  exhibiting life's workings.  Early visitors, whether Spanish, Dutch or American, saw them as  divine rejects.  So remote were they, according to Larson, that pirates successfully used them  as a hideaway.  English explorers like Cook and Vancouver simply passed them by.  Herman  Melville, of Moby Dick fame, manifested his aversion to their dark desolation.  This negative  outlook was changed by one man.  The central role played by the Galapagos in Darwin's  faith-shattering idea that life isn't divinely originated can't be overstated.  Today, many  naturalists consider the islands a shrine to reason and science.<br />Larson establishes the value of the islands in his description of European astonishment at the  sight of life in the New World.  While no mythical monsters emerged to view, it was clear that  all forms of life there were different from European examples.  In Larson's view, explaining  this conundrum forced the theory of &quot;special creation&quot; - the Christian deity spent a great deal  of energy supplying life forms to each region of the globe.  It was so special that in the  Galapagos unique species were assigned places on each island separately.  This challenge to  logic gave naturalists a desire for a better explanation.  It took Charles Darwin's visit and a  further two decades of his thinking to come up with the correct answer.  That solution was  evolution by natural selection, and Larson spends most of the book in showing how the  islands remain pivotal in applying Darwin's insight to events still transpiring there.<br />Larson relates the numerous expeditions sent by American researchers during the early 20th  Century.  Perceiving the reduced populations of many species, especially tortoises, they  proceeded to slaughter large numbers in order to &quot;learn more about them before they're  exterminated.&quot;  This twisted logic had the virtue of attracting more attention on the islands'  role in revealing how evolution works.  According to Larson, David Lack, in studying the  multiple forms of Galapagos finches, projected Darwin's concept in understandable detail.  Coining the term &quot;Darwin's Finches&quot; he created a phrase still used in biology texts.  The  research on those finches has taken a highly detailed aspect.  Larson, discovering Jonathan  Weiner's &quot;The Beak of the Finch,&quot; adds his tribute to the work of Peter and Rosemary Grant on  Daphne Major.  Weiner's account need not be repeated here, but all readers are encouraged to  obtain his book.  The Grants have confirmed Darwin as no other studies have done.<br />The clash of national interests and scientific research has brought the islands and their natural  inhabitants close to grief.  Once the site of a prison colony, now the Charles Darwin research  station is the target of attention.  Visitors arrive daily, and solitary residents are found in  remote hideaways.  With occupants and explorers bringing goats, rats and other visitors,  maintaining the original environment has proved impossible.  The Grants have sustained  their programme only because Daphne Major remains isolated.  Calls by the scientific  community to restrain invasion haven't been ignored, but isolation is no longer feasible.  Larson avoids judgmental statements, acknowledging that the islands' chief attraction is eco- tourism.  With a permanent resident population, encouraging visitors is a major source of  income.  Conservation efforts, he maintains, are effective, but visitor numbers continue to  impact the environment.  And more visitors means an enlarging resident population to serve  them.  Recently, those residents have resisted conservation efforts, sometimes violently, as  they, too, struggle to survive an inhospitable realm.  Larson depicts this unending story with  guarded optimism for improved recognition of the value of evolution's workshop.  We can  but hope that this book will provide further impetus to balance the needs of Galapagos  inhabitants, animal and people alike.larging resident population to serve   them.

2023573:US	50941451	R2TEVU7ZUYYEFK	0385499345	475272008	The Lexus and the Olive Tree: Understanding Globalization	Books	4	18	20	N	N	&quot;No one is in charge!&quot;	Those fearing this book is a treatise in economics, take heart.  Lexus isn't about numbers or  the arcane world of international banking - it's about attitude.  If your attitude is open to  global thinking, untrammelled by tradition or restrictive cultural ideas, you will surely  succeed in improving your lifestyle.  If you hold too tightly to traditional ideals, you will just  as surely fail.  Either way, you'd best buy, read, and understand this book.  Friedman's  analysis conveys the thinking of too many people.  You cannot afford to ignore it.<br />With evangelical fervour, Friedman explains how the end of the Cold War unleashed  American  capitalism around the globe.  While &quot;free market&quot; capitalism had been a weapon in  those years of missile diplomacy, the breakup of the Soviet Union left the American economic  model without a major opponent.  The collapse of the Berlin Wall, coinciding with the rise of  the high speed digital communications, led to a new era of global finance.  Once, &quot;the sun  never set on the British Empire.&quot;  Now the Internet allows investment activity continuously  and without hindrance.  The market is never closed as international financial transactions  occur constantly, and at light speed.  And the market is open to anyone wishing to participate.<br />Friedman argues that the American model of capitalism is the ideal version.  Government  must play a minimal role.  Labour unions are to be quelled.  No favours are to be shown to  any not meeting the new performance standards.  The &quot;wounded&quot; firm must be killed off to  allow the successful to continue.  There will be disruptions in peoples' lives, but emerging  new businesses will pick up any slack.  The reward will be growth and enhanced living  standards.  The system is so well established now, according to Friedman, that it can, is and  will be exported successfully around the planet.  Anyone it touches need only accept it  without question.<br />Global acceptance, of course, is the rub.  The world isn't [yet] American.  Scattered around our  planet are numerous cultures who either haven't seen the light or resist its premise.  These are  the peoples who cling to their &quot;olive trees&quot; in defiance of Americanization.  Friedman  recognizes their concern over losing what they feel is valuable.  He should, his interviewees  have told him so often enough.  He doesn't want them subjugated to an American ideal, he  wants them to buy into the system voluntarily.  Many want what the new economic system  offers, he stresses.  They simply have to learn how to adjust their values enough to bring  America's financial methods into their own culture.  How are they to achieve this feat?  Replace restrictive or unresponsive governments.  How this is to be achieved in the face of the  pace of globalization is left unexplained.<br />Friedman's eagerness is contagious.  It seems cruel to refute a man who presents his case with  such honesty and in such a readable style.  He carries you along with finesse and you have no  feeling of being duped by someone so forthright.  He wants everybody to accept his  assertions because he sincerely believes those who do will benefit from the new economics.  He addresses every objection, meeting each head-on with convincing arguments.  He admits,  for example, that not everyone has access to the digital communications making globalization  possible.  Easily solved, he says.  One cell 'phone per village is a good start.  Even the  environmental concerns are [briefly] touched - conservationists adopting capitalist tactics will  save the rain forest.  I'm not making this up!  He means what he says.<br />What he fails to recognize is that high speed communication, instantaneous finance and rapid  economic growth carries an exacting price.  Consumption at the American pace over the  whole planet means production to meet the demand.  That level of production is reflected in  the inroads being made on the world's resources.

2041327:US	50941451	R38N4Y13BMQOPH	0156006537	509337312	Becoming Human: Evolution and Human Uniqueness	Books	3	55	63	N	N	In solitary splendour	Coming from a man with Tattersall's qualifications, this book springs real surprises on the  reader.  Viewing the human evolutionary process in reverse, he begins with Paleolithic age  art and retains a strongly European oriented view thoughout the book.  Presented an image  of &quot;superior&quot; European founders of our cultural heritage, it's almost impossible to shed the  WASP image he conjures in the reader.  While it's convenient to replace &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; with  the [hopefully] less cumbersome &quot;Cro-Magnon&quot;, Tattersall leaves us in no doubt that either  label remains limited to the European scene.<br />Confirming this narrow view in the first chapter, he offers the astonishing statement that &quot;art,  as such, is a concept invented by Western civilization.&quot;  This proposal might be forgiven as an  editing oversight, if the remainder of the book didn't sustain it.  Conceding Australian  Aborigine art as &quot;curious&quot;, he fails to note it predates his beloved French gallery by ten  millennia.  Coming from a Curator of Anthropology, it's an astonishing submission.<br />Broadening our view, readers are cautioned to spend time on Chapter 3, &quot;Evolution for  What?&quot;  A review of various renderings of Darwin's evolution by natural selection, the aim of  the chapter is to disabuse readers of the idea that evolution has a purpose.  However, there's a  subtle agenda.  Not hidden, subtle.  He gives us the background of Darwin's thinking in  developing the thesis, following that with 20th Century investigators possessing the tools of  genetics.  Assembling scholars from the mid-twentieth century, he builds what he labels the  &quot;Evolutionary Synthesis&quot; which generally supported the idea of gradual change in species.  Based on genetics, the Synthesis challenged patterns exhibited by the fossil record.  A new  challenge arose, this time against the Synthesis, in the form of the Eldredge-Gould idea of  punctuated equilibrium, or &quot;evolution by jerks.&quot;<br />Tattersall abandons any remaining objectivity at this point to defend his chum Eldredge  against critics.  While granting absolution to Eldredge and Gould's &quot;inevitable&quot; overstatement  of their case, he condemns George Williams and Richard Dawkins for their focus on genetic  adaptation as the centrepiece of evolution's process.  Labelling Dawkins a &quot;reductionist&quot; in  proposing the gene drives evolution, he claims that such ideas are &quot;always attractive to the  human mind&quot;.  Tattersall contends Dawkins' viewpoint &quot;eliminates anything larger than the  individual gene as an actor in the evolutionary process&quot;.  Like most of Dawkins' critics,  Tattersall deftly ignores Dawkins' repeated reminder that &quot;the individual gene&quot; works in  concert with its fellows and its host organism within the broader environment.  Although an  interesting review of the evolutionary scenarios, this chapter is almost a non-sequitur to the  remainder of the book.<br />In a bizarre turn for an anthropologist, Tattersall blithely discounts the scope of studies in  primate--human behaviour patterns.  Having declared art an artefact of Western Civilization,  he ignores the many examples of art by animals other than human.  Elephants, chimpanzees  and others have produced art that fooled even the critics, but Tattersall ignores its existence.  Overlooking physical disparities between humans and other primates, he disparages claims  that chimpanzees can develop even rudimentary language skills.  In short, based on  language, art and cognitive abilities, humans are simply too unique to be grouped with our  primate cousins.<br />Finally, Tattersall traces the hominid exodus from Africa.  A single sentence acknowledges  early hominids in eastern Asia.  From that he gives extended attention to emigration into  Europe.  Contending with Neanderthal populations which preceded them, the Cro-Magnon  directly overcame Neanderthal.  How was this feat accomplished by a creature with a smaller  brain than that of its adversary?  He gives early hominid tool-makers enhanced cognitive  skills instead of learning by sheer opportunism.  In line with Eldredge's &quot;evolutionary jerks,&quot;  this grants these &quot;Cro-Magnon&quot; a sudden intellectual growth spurt leading to tool production,  a questionable assumption.  Once established, this process increased Homo sapiens' intellect  giving them dominance over their larger but &quot;dumber&quot; fellows.  Neanderthals at best were  imitative, lacking originality and inventiveness.<br />In a novel proposal for establishment of human communities, Tattersall suggests they're  based on the human birth canal.  Unlike other primates, the canal's position makes births  difficult enough to require assistance.  Gatherings of midwives led to interdependent  communities of individuals.  Contributing language skills enlarged the capacity of these  communities to form more cohesive establishments - the village.  Language is also granted  the primary role for Cro-Magnon's elimination of Neanderthal - communication is a key  military element.  Conquest allowed the leisure for artistic skills to follow.<br />While this book is offers many assertions departing from consensus paleoanthropology,  perhaps it's that very aberration that gives it value.  While the mainstream path of evolution  clearly refutes the idea of punctuated equilibrium, there's no disputing the course of human  evolution is abrupt and unique.  No other species has achieved the intelligence level of Homo  sapiens nor, as Tattersall reminds us, has any species established global occupation.  This  book is a valuable read for the novelty of many its assertions.  It should not, therefore, be read  and comprehended in isolation.  Other studies on evolution's course and humanity's place on  it should join this book on your shelves.eanderthal.

That he is the editor of this anthology instead of the writer doesn't prove a disappointment.  Quite the reverse.  Quammen's writing skills are nearly matched by each of the essays he's selected for this collection.  With topics ranging from gorillas to GUTs, we're presented with delightful reading.  Every essay will compete for your attention, subtly commanding some time for further reflection, and perhaps action.  Quammen's given us readings of compelling interest.  Going through this series in one reading may be overwhelming.  A pause for personal afterthought could follow each of these articles.<br />Although a series of excellent pieces, the opening choice was unfortunate.  Natalie Angier's diatribe against evolutionary psychology is overblown, overstated and overfocussed.  Feminist writers find natural selection a ready target in these days of &quot;political correctness&quot; joining religious fundamentalism in assaulting Darwin from left and right.  Attacking an  emerging science such as evolutionary psychology is facile.  Researchers groping for answers in a field fraught with prejudices and limited information are an easy target.  Castigating &quot;evo-psychos&quot;, as she terms them, as inconsistent, ignores the problems encountered in establishing a new scientific field.  Human behaviour has been the subject of study for  millennia.  Today, molecular genetics is revealing biological sources for many behaviours giving firmer answers than we've ever had.  While she rails at &quot;Darwinian logic&quot;, whatever that means, for allotting human male/female roles, the reader can only wonder if she's aware of the wealth of research in those roles in other primates.  As a journalistic sniper instead of a researcher, Angier adds nothing to resolving these questions or even posing new ones.  Having judged the science as flawed seems sufficient for her purposes.<br />In striking contrast to Angier's vituperation, the pearl in this collection is Ken Lamberton's very compassionate account in &quot;The Wisdom of the Toads.&quot;  Quammen's ability to bring the reader into the account has received attention from this reviewer elsewhere.  Lamberton's analogue ability gives a graceful style to his description of desert toads and their erratic life.  As he and his daughters watch the toads adapting to the unpredictable ways of desert realities, we are granted insight to Lamberton's own reality.  While jarring, his admission detracts neither from his powers of perception nor his gently insistent power of his descriptions.  His writing commands respect; his close-up view of Nature one we should all emulate.  It is particularly interesting that he shares place in this collection with Angier, while  inadvertently refuting her.<br />Several essays dealing with other animals are curtailed in geography, but unlimited in approach.  From African wild dogs, we're shown the threats posed to gorillas by human wars, to humans by viruses of chimpanzee origin.  An almost whimsical essay introduces us to &quot;Lulu, Queen of the Camels.&quot;  Cullen Murphy skirts the ludicrous in his narration of the first  serious biological study of nature's most useful animal.  While many of us think of the camel as a Saharan native, Africa was the last continent reached though natural means by this intriguing creature.  Few domesticated animals escape conversion to entertainment roles and Camelus Dromedarius is no exception.  The camel racing industry, although rewarding to its practitioners, is beset with unique problems.<br />While biological research reveals increasing diversity in the pattern of life, physicists are probing atoms for signs of uniformity.  The quest for a Grand Unified Theory [GUT] has been  elusive.  Gary Taubes' account of a quest for a &quot;Rosetta Stone&quot; between Einstein's General Relativity theory and quantum mechanics provides interesting surprises.  He turns what  could be an arcane topic into a comprehensible picture of the forces underlying our universe.<br />While the Cold War era produced many works of fact and fiction designed to jar us into more responsible actions, none matches Richard Preston's &quot;The Demon in the Freezer&quot; for ability to  frighten readers.  We've taken comfort, and no little vicarious pride, in the eradication of smallpox, but Preston jars us back to reality with this account of a hidden global threat.  A  1972 outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia launches a vivid description of the disease's ability to propagate.  That it was stopped required an autocratic government using tactics North  American governments would reject.  Yet real threats of infection remain, and the source of a new plague may lie in your backyard.  Poxviruses move easily through the animal kingdom, and have the capacity to &quot;jump&quot; species, mutating as it infects.  Preston's description of pox mechanics isn't dinner-time reading.  The pox dissolves animal tissue, particularly the gut, leaving a residue of intestinal fluids and pox viruses.  Hence, &quot;don't eat . . . &quot;!<br />A supporting &quot;further reading&quot; list would have iced this appealing confection of essays.  Quammen provides the next thing with biographical sketches of the writers plus the runners- up in the selection process.  A little delving with a good search engine has already turned up a few of these, demonstrating the challenges Quammen faced in making choices.  None are failures in writing.  Quammen has never disappointed and has now added editing skills to his superlative writing ones.  This book will entertain, shock, and inspire you.  With something in it for all, it's also worth the purchase in providing new areas of interest.rovides interesting surprises.

Virtually conscripted into Lancre's witches' coven as  the junior member, she replaces Magrat Garlick as &quot;the maiden.&quot;  She feels she's in Magrat's  shadow, but given their comparative girths, that takes some doing.  Agnes' size adds to her  resentments, but she can't help being heavy.  If that wasn't enough, she suffers an alter ego  named Perdita who can't refrain from commenting on Agnes' size, personality or appearance.  An petulant character, Agnes isn't easy to like, but she bears heavy burdens - besides herself.<br />Attending a naming ceremony for Magrat's newborn, Agnes encounters two new men in her  life.  Mightily Oats is a priest of Om who's spent far too much time in libraries to act as a rock  of the faith.  Omnians used to burn people, except, according to Granny Weatherwax, never  witches.  Time brings change, and Omnism was forever changed by the Prophet Brutha.  Disputation, replacing  [In]Quisition, led to so many schismatics debating theology that in Oats' case, he's constantly  debating himself.  Later, when it's Granny he's debating, the scene is one of Pratchett's most  outstanding exchanges.<br /> The other young man is more imposing.  Vlad Magpyr is a member of a family relocating to  Lancre from the Uberwald.  They've arrived to take over the country.  They're vampires -  yuppie vampires, no less.  Under the tutelage of Count Magyr, they're trying an Uberwald  version of The Power of Positive Thinking.  That means they're learning to resist all the usual  weapons against vampires.  &quot;Garlic?  Just a seasoning.&quot;  Sunlight?  Build up an immunity by  starting with cloudy days and working to brighter ends.  This version of &quot;self-help&quot; has made  them very powerful.  In fact, they appear invulnerable against any attempt to control them.<br />The Lancre witches coven should be able to resist the vampires' takeover of Lancre without  difficulty - evil forces have been overcome in the past.  The coven's membership, however,  has shifted roles.  Granny Weatherwax, doyenne of Discworld witchdom, has gone walkabout  in a fit of pique.  The traditional arrangement of &quot;maiden, mother, crone&quot; promotes Nanny  Ogg to the primary role.  She's comfortable with neither the role nor its label.  Lancre witches  are nothing if not flexible, however, and the shifted roles lead to some interesting changes in  personality.  Magrat's new responsibility as a mum is still settling itself, but rest assured,  former witch or not, &quot;tradition&quot; is a word cast well aside.<br />Pratchett's Discworld narratives successively display less humour, but increasingly more wit  and insight.  His knowledge of our world is shrewdly presented through his stories of the  Disc.  What other &quot;fantasy&quot; writer gives you glimpses of plate tectonics, evolution and the  drought-producing El Nino?  Who else presents us with little painted blue men, speaking an  almost familiar language and the most talented cattle thieves on the Disc?  They also write  &quot;verra comp-lic-ated documents&quot; as any London solicitor could attest.<br />This story might be viewed as a simple contest between good and evil.  Not in Pratchett's  hands.  Evil is rarely absolute on Discworld and good's victories seldom unqualified.  Vlad  Magpyr asks Agnes to compare the vampires' plans for Lancre with human's raising beef  cattle.  Vampires may make people slaves, but can also keep their minds at ease.  Isn't that a  fair trade-off?  Does it sound familiar?  The struggle against such logic requires strength of  will and a clear mind.  Which of the triad's five has sufficient talent to bring such talents to  bear?  They all have certain insights into the mind's workings.  One of them even terms the  true power of witches &quot;headology,&quot; granting it greater power than magic.  Is this power  effective against the forces of the Magpyr clan?  Does the logic of the conclusion appeal to  you?  If this book has a weakness, it is the ending.  Yet once again, Pratchett has fulfilled his  desire to portray &quot;a mirror of worlds.&quot;ion appeal to  you?  If this book has a weakness, it is the ending.

The first, A.J.P. Taylor's The Origins  of the Second World War, scythed away the view that Hitler was solely responsible for  western Europe's greatest political error.  The second is this result of Len Deighton's extensive  research on the politics, diplomacy and mechanics of that conflict.<br />Blood, Tears and Folly may be considered an off-shoot of his other works, both fiction and  non-fiction, on the years prior to the war and of the actual fighting.  He rightly subtitles this  book &quot;An Objective Look&quot; in response to the many years of laudatory histories and memoirs  deluging both the reading public and history classrooms.  Deighton has a realistic view of  history, dealing carefully and dispassionately with the issues at all levels.  He knows that  success in war is often due to chance decisions.  He also knows, and tells us clearly, that the  decision-makers must reach their conclusions from an informed and dispassionate  foundation.  This isn't a common feature among military &quot;leaders&quot; and probably even more  rare among politicians dealing in foreign affairs.<br />This book is more than a journalist's account of an historical period.  It's a clarion call to keep  a watchful eye on your leaders.  Too often, and certainly in the period of this book, long-term  policies remain unconsidered while striving to accomplish immediate gains.  Prejudices  abound, guiding men into foolish decisions for which many will pay the ultimate price.<br />Deighton appears to be whacking the British here.  However, keep in mind that the Empire of  Victoria Regina remained the dominant force in the world and the British never tired of  saying so.  That attitude was the pivotal folly of British politicians, although America's  buying into the idea was just as foolish.  If anything made World War II inevitable instead of  the aberration logic suggests it should be, it's this outlook.  The world, particularly Western  European nations, resented Britain's arrogance.  It had led in large part to World War I.  Unable to learn anything from the causes of that conflict, British policies simply repeated old  mistakes in new ways, a misplaced pride leading to a new fall.<br />Deighton manages to carefully balance Britain's short sighted attitude about European affairs  with various other elements that will impact the course of the war.  He has an exceptional  ability to make what ought to be the most mundane topics, machines and technologies, into  fascinating elements of the story.  Familiar to us now, things like radar and rockets were  innovations then and their successes were due to the people working with them.  Deighton's  ability to delve into the personal viewpoint adds significantly to the enjoyment of this book.f  the aberration logic suggests it should be, it's this outlook.

Terry Pratchett, carrying a reputation of being a major force in writing  fantasy and humour has shed both in this penetrating book.  It's an incisive satire of the mores  and methods of the three major religions of Western Civilization.  Pratchett's astute axiom  that the Discworld is a &quot;mirror of worlds&quot; applies with more force here than any other  Discworld book.  Pratchett casts away whatever subtle restraint he's given other philosophical  issues to directly confront us with a harsh truth about faiths.<br />The basic theme is a simple, but rarely recognized, truth.  Gods are created by people.  The  fewer the believers, the smaller and weaker the god.  When belief fades or believers  eliminated, the gods cease to exist.  Once mighty, the god Om has been relegated to the body  of a tortoise.  He retains but one true believer: Brutha, a novice in the Citadel of Om.  Brutha  makes frequent reference to segments of the &quot;holy book&quot; Om supposedly authored.  Mystified  by attribution to himself of these writings, Om wonders who really wrote them.  And why  they were written.  What has been perpetrated in His Name?<br />Brutha, who has a photographic memory, is conscripted into a religious crusade against  neighbouring Ephebe.  The Omnian Church wants to erase Ephebe's false belief that the  world is a disc riding on the backs of four elephants standing on a turtle swimming through  space.  According to Vorbis, head of the Quisition, such false doctrine must be erased, erasing  the Ephebians in the process, if necessary.  Besides, Ephebe's on the best trade route to the  Turnwise coast.  Tucked away in Brutha's pocket, Om is taken along.  But how does Vorbis  expect to conquer mighty Ephebe, home of philosopher kings, with a token force of fifty  soldiers?<br />Pratchett is as direct as Vorbis is devious.  There's an old saying that runs &quot;I'm not a bigot, I  hate everybody&quot;.  Vorbis doesn't hate anybody, just those following false doctrines.  Nor does  Pratchett hate anyone, but his scathing wit in this book leaves few untouched .  There are  some light passages, but this book is deadly serious.  It's not small gods, but small minds that  Pratchett targets and he hits the mark unerringly [He's nearly prescient about Christian  reaction to J.K. Rowlings' Harry Potter books].  Pratchett holds the mirror before us to  consider our beliefs.  What do we have faith in, and what sustains that faith?.  If it proves  false, how do we respond?  What an experience it would be to visit Pratchett when one of the  evangelicals arrives at the door!  If he's as verbally devastating as he is with the printed word,  there'd only be a smudge on the doormat.&quot;I'm not a bigot, I  hate everybody&quot;.

Shortsighted management has forced another \\"downsizing\\".  This time the victim of layoff is  Death himself, \\"retired\\" by the Auditors.  He does his job efficiently and he doesn't sass the  boss.  He's just become \\"too involved\\" with those due to receive attention from his infinitely  sharp scythe.  The Auditors want a firmer hand on the reaping blade.  On the street with time  on his hands, Death decides he's going to spend it.  Wandering the Discworld, he \\"gets his  feet under the table\\" as hired man at Miss Flitworth's farm.  Although a bit confused about  eating and sleeping, he's able to respond with resolute affirmation when she asks, \\"Can you  use a scythe?\\"  He demonstrates a harvesting technique only Pratchett could devise.<br /><br />With Death no longer performing his role, strange events result.  Unconfined, the life force  manifests itself in bizarre ways.  Death, visible to wizards, fails to arrive at an appointment.  In consequence, Windle Poons is subjected to various indignities.  His colleagues have a  prejudice about zombies.  Not having actually died, Windle decides to start to live.  Over a  century of breathing doesn't necessarily mean you've been living, and Windle, like Death,  decides to see something of the [Disc]world.  His colleagues, uncertain as to why Windle's  still upright and subjected to some mild indignities of their own, seek the cause of unusual manifestations.<br /><br />If you're new to the Discworld, all this must sound pretty grotesque.  Death \\"fired\\" only to  become a reaper on a spinster's farm?  Wizards who can see him and know precisely when  he's due?  Take heart, this isn't a bleak version of the Merlin legend, nor a Stephen King  horror story.  It's Terry Pratchett, a writer with an unmatched talent for looking at the world  we live in.  He peers deeply at how life works.  Then with countless deft twists, restructures  our globe into a flat Disc.  The Disc's filled with novel ideas and even more unusual people,  but on second glance all seem terribly familiar.  Death isn't a killer, for example.  He's only  there to collect lives when they're due to end.  Unlike the tax man, he only arrives once, and  he's terribly, terribly good at his job.<br /><br />To those familiar with Pratchett, this book should receive high marks.  All of Ankh-Morpork's  finest are here - even Sergeant Colon makes an appearance.  While enlarging on the cameos  Death's played in other Discworld books, Pratchett nearly lets Miss Flitworth walk away with  this one.  But it's Sal Lifton who does that - the Small Child who recognizes Bill Door as a  \\"skellington\\" as she ponders how he can eat or sleep.  For it's Sal who personifies why Death's  been put out to pasture [sorry!].

Death isn't a killer, for example.  He's only  there to collect lives when they're due to end.  Unlike the tax man, he only arrives once, and  he's terribly, terribly good at his job.    To those familiar with Pratchett, this book should receive high marks.  All of Ankh-Morpork's  finest are here - even Sergeant Colon makes an appearance.  While enlarging on the cameos  Death's played in other Discworld books, Pratchett nearly lets Miss Flitworth walk away with  this one.  But it's Sal Lifton who does that - the Small Child who recognizes Bill Door as a  \\"skellington\\" as she ponders how he can eat or sleep.

Why is 'Western' culture so unlike that of the majority of other societies in the world?  Cahill  identifies the sources of our culture in ancient Judaism and relates the revolutionary changes  the Jews introduced.  In a conceptual treatise, he explains how a small band of people  departed from their neighbours by revising their view of the universe and themselves.  Viewing time as linear instead of cyclical, replacing a pantheon of deities with monotheism,  and enhancing individuality are facets of our culture directly contrasted with those who view  Nature as the basis of belief.<br />These new cultural elements violently detached us from nature.  We were given the arrogance  to ignore natural rules, using 'divine' commands as an excuse to conquer nature and those  who worship it.  His opening quote from Black Elk represents the view of those displaced by  the 'gifts' granted by the Jewish heritage to Christianity.  This arrogance is superbly  demonstrated by the book's subtitle: How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way  Everyone Thinks and Feels.  Everyone?  Or just those who believe that we have a divine grant  to subjugate the rest of Nature?  This book is an invitation to reflect on who it is we are.  That's a question we should ask ourselves from time to time.  Gifts doesn't make that query  directly, but the implication is strongly felt.<br />What is the impact of this novel way of thinking about ourselves?  For one thing, the linear  view of time is the basis for all Western scientific thought.  Without such a concept we could  never recognize how evolution controls the flow of life.  Seeking the  mechanics of the Big  Bang wouldn't be among our enquiries.  We would never have sought an answer to our  origins either cosmic or biological.  Cahill contends that adopting the new view of time  imparted the concept of free will, which allowed us the freedom to pursue such inquiries.<br />Monotheism is the most significant element in Cahill's account.  Countless aspects of our  society derive from this innovation.  History is replete with accounts of gods who dealt  directly with humanity, more often amicably than otherwise.  Zeus descends from Olympus,  frolicking with the peasant girls.  Among the Australian Aborigines, Baiame joins the hunters,  sometimes guiding them to game.  Other gods play practical jokes, usually as object lessons.  Their company was often sought, and while the gods sometimes acted on whim, fear was not  the basis of peoples' relationship with their deities.  The gods were as often joyful as terrible.<br />The Jews' god, however, put it point blank: 'I am a jealous god!'  In other words, 'I am a petty- minded god concerned with small things!'  How much has followed from that dictum?  Not  only were the Jews forbidden to worship other deities, ultimately it came to mean that no  others were permitted to exist.  If they manifested themselves, they were to be eliminated.  Since the only way a deity can reveal itself is through its followers, those believers must  convert or be destroyed.  The impact of the global sweep of Judeo-Christian culture over our  planet resulting from that one decree  remains to be assessed.  Cahill describes this  imperialism as having 'taken hold in' and being 'subscribed to' by all non-Western societies [p.  250].  He omits mentioning the subscriptions were achieved at gun point and the bill for the  subscriptions paid for in human blood.<br />Those who grizzle about this book not being 'scholarly' clearly have failed to discern its  worth.  Wrapping up such vast concepts in 290 pages is no mean feat.  It is, after all, the  foundation of today's Western society he's coping with here.  Would this book actually benefit  from more citations and a longer bibliography?  I doubt it.  Perhaps a few of you maligning  his efforts should go back and take another look.  Cahill's  organization and writing ability  combine to present the reader a worthy addition to any bookshelf.The only real downside is  that it's clear we're going to have to buy the entire series to have the whole story.  Not a bad  investment for those with children.lf.  The only real downside is  that it's clear we're going to have to buy the entire series to have the whole story.

Civilization originates in the Mediterranean basin when agrarian peoples became urbanized,  militarized city-states.  Spreading from Babylon through Greece, thence to Rome,  &quot;civilization&quot; become a European phenomenon.  With empire came wealth, stability and  leisure, and the emergence of literature.  Literature is Cahill's theme in presenting both his  concept of civilization and how a remote island restored it to a devastated continent.<br />Cahill opens his story with the wealthy Roman poet Ausonius in a Gallic villa, musing on the  pleasures of life in a stable empire.  Stability is an illusion.  Barbarians have infiltrated the  Empire's borders or overrun them by onslaught.  Within a brief lifetime all that Ausonius has  known will become chaos as the empire is fragmented and reduced.  All that remains is the  tenuous network of Christian adherents spread across the crumbling remains of Rome's  imperial breadth.  When these gathered into communities, learning, teaching, recording, they  formed a nucleus for the restoration of literacy.<br />As the empire contracted, little enclaves of oral traditions remained in place.  Of these,  according to Cahill, Ireland was the strongest.  Although beset by countless internal conflicts,  Ireland's traditions remained respected by all - even those contending for tiny kingdoms.  Into  this arena entered a former slave of the Irish, Patricius.  A half-hearted Christian turned  evangelist, Patricius founded numerous bishoprics across Ireland, laying the foundation for a  string of monastic orders.  Combining Irish oral tradition with remnant literacy, the monks  began founding a new wave of monasteries, first in Britain, then across Europe.  In this way  learning was kept alive and Christianity redeemed what had been destroyed by the invasions.  A foundation for a new civilization had been established.<br />Cahill, admitting that a true account of Patricius' life is difficult to assemble, still provides us a  picture of a man of strong faith and dedication.  The Irish environment was a challenge to a  man of peace, but Patricius seems to have accomplished the near-impossible.  The Irish began  to settle down, making Patricius' task rewarding instead of just onerous.  Ireland became the  only nation in which Christianity was established without the blood of martyrs.  Given  Ireland's past history, this seems an implausible claim, but Cahill puts it forth confidently.<br />Cahill's style in presenting this story is unimpeachable.  He's a convincing writer, even if his  view of civilization is limited.  His ability to establish a compelling environment for the life of  Patrick and his success is a challenge to other historians.  In order to accomplish his task in so  few pages is a testimony to his talent.  More importantly, Cahill has proposed a novel theme,  changing the consensus of history's view that a slowly recovering economy brought about  Europe's restoration.  It's a valuable idea, presented plausibly.ll, admitting that a true account of Patricius' life is difficult to assemble, still provides us a  picture of a man of strong faith and dedication.

As part of his Hinges of History series, Cahill places  the Jesus story in its historical setting.  Whatever your view of Jesus' divinity, there's no  gainsaying the importance of his followers in the stream of history.  Not only the history of  Europe, but given the migrations of his adherents, throughout the world.  Although the book  is filled with the message of love and peace, Cahill's opening statement about hills lists all  battle sites.  Not an auspicious beginning for a study of a &quot;new word&quot; supplanting the turmoil  of the age.  Like nearly all Christian historical writers, Cahill's description of the pagan world  is bleak.  Only by making the social environment of the era as desolate as possible does the  arrival of the &quot;good news&quot; concept work.  Cahill would have us believe the pre-Christian  civilization  offered no solace, had no love, no joy, people suffering empty lives with no hope.  It's difficult to believe that the Mediterranean world was that much different from any other.<br />This being an historical treatise, Cahill must rely on his sources.  These are naturally scant,  since Jesus went unnoticed by contemporary commentators.  Another agitator in a backwater  Roman colony was of little import.  Cahill must, perforce, turn to the Gospels for his relation  of this vital historical character.  He omits reference to the long history of critiques of these  documents.  Instead, he grants them high validity.  This is surprising in light of the long  duration between the events and their written recording.  The time lapse is decades, not just  weeks or a few years.  He uncritically credits the accounts as being retrieved from the  memories of those who supposedly witnessed the events.  This is startling.  Anyone who's  ever played Gossip, passing a whispered message from person to person, knows how garbled  the original statement becomes in but minutes.  What quirks of memory can occur over  decades?  Of course, as Cahill stresses, it's the message in the Gospel that's important.  True  enough, but we're supposed to be dealing in history here, not evangelism.<br />Cahill examines each of the Gospels in turn, relating them with an easy wit.  The chapter on  Saul/Paul as a Jewish/Greek intellectual is the high point of the book.  Cahill presents in  modern language the various stilted texts Christians are subjected to.  The effect is charming.  Readers unfamiliar with Cahill's style may be jolted, but he's trying to convey a complex story  without sinking into a prolix academic style.  He deserves credit for his courage in doing this.  He's clearly trying to widen his audience with the message.  The message from the Gospels  lacks unity, of course.  Given the diversity of times and authors, with texts further modified  by attentions from later contributors, his task is daunting but not insurmountable.  Accepting  these problems in pinpointing sources, Cahill is able to impart the theme of each Gospel  clearly.  He doesn't get bogged down in academic trivia.  For Cahill, the value of the message  far outweighs other considerations.<br />Cahill believes in the message.  He stresses that Jesus sought justice, suggesting this was a  novelty in the era.  It's a novelty in any era, and others have pursued the same goal.  Even that  Roman Empire so maligned by Christians [and Cahill] tried various means to achieve it.  In  Rome, Consuls were given authority for but one year to prevent accumulation of power  leading to injustice.  It eluded them, it eluded Jesus, and it's eluded Christians as Cahill points  out in his discussion of anti-Semetism through the ages.  He spends some time on this  particular form of Christian injustice.  It's disappointing that he can move out of his declared  time span in addressing this issue while ignoring many others equally significant.  Christians  have displaced or eradicated peoples throughout their history.  The Incas are gone.  The Maya  likewise, their vast story of holy books torched by priests.  Hearts and minds can be won at  swords' point - the history of Christianity confirms it.<br />The question arises - who should buy and read this book?  If you want a concise history of  Jesus' era, this is a good start.  If you don't want to wade through the King James, New  English or Vulgate bibles but wish to understand what the fuss is about, this is a good review  of the Gospels and their writers.  If you wish to assess whether Jesus has a message for you,  perhaps you'll gain some insight from Cahill's presentation.  If you're not a Christian, Cahill,  although he's firmly convinced, isn't likely to make you one.

He's escaped the ferocity  of Captain Logan's Moreton Bay penal colony.  Maggs also carries evidence that Logan inflicted more whippings than any other camp commandant in the colony.  His back betokens applications of the &quot;double cat&quot;.  Invented in Australia, the multi-stranded  lash  was used to discipline the lags.  If caught, Maggs'll immediately be hanged, but his quest overcomes his fear of the noose.  He's seeking someone important in his life.  But fate throws impediments in his way.  Among them is Peter Carey's appropriation of Charles Dickens as an investigative journalist.<br />Carey's engrossing story is his finest effort.  He's created a character that only an author imbued with accounts of transportee [convicts, lags] travails could achieve.  The Australian  penal colony system was the antithesis of our concept of Victorian morality.  Escaped  prisoners were rare in Australia - there was nowhere to go.  A lag returning to England was  unheard of.  In any case, the character of every lag underwent a change.  They became two  people; one the Englishman of a previous life and the other the result of the dehumanizing  conditions suffered in that remote continent.  Carey captures that duality with finesse and  ardor.  Driven by his quest, Maggs must adopt a servant's mien, even as his past experiences  and cunning born of survival places him above the devious people he encounters daily.  He  has, after all, been sent to Australia, not for his crimes, but through an unparalleled act of self  sacrifice.  Maggs must mentally dodge and weave, moving between the worlds of Percy  Buckle, Tobias Oates and the street urchin he was before being sent across the seas.  Carey's  fashioned a tormented figure set in the chaotic venue of 19th Century England.<br />Equating Carey with Charles Dickens is misleading.  Dickens was an investigative journalist  turned novelist.  In a later age, Theodore Roosevelt would brand such people &quot;muckrakers&quot;.  Carey's isn't reporting what he's observed, driven by championing the poor Dickens divulged  to his Victorian readers.  Carey's account is pure fiction, no matter how many real characters  and true life conditions he imparts.  His creative  qualities quite set him apart from Dickens.  Simply setting this story in mid-19th Century London doesn't limit it to a Dickensian  framework.  Dickens, his outlook confined to the British Isles, couldn't have written this book.  Carey's Australian background brings subtle nuances to Jack in his characterization.  It's  unlikely that any Anglo-American author could impart the moods Carey achieves in his  portrayal of Maggs.  This book is a true prize.re Roosevelt would brand such people &quot;muckrakers&quot;.

It's compelling story of the  growth of paleoanthropology in the 20th Century remains unmatched.  Johanson's role  should be known to most, but this personal relation endures as a landmark for those  interested in the development of humanity.  He's given us a lucid story of the life and work  of the paleoanthropologist both in the field and laboratory.  He is candid in assessing other  workers and himself in tracing the line of descent from ape-like creatures to modern humans.<br />He opens with a peerless overview of the key figures in the field, their insights, prejudices,  successes and failures.  The field was dominated by British research.  The small German  community of scientists held little challenge, and American researchers were nonexistent.  Heady with victories that had left the Victorian Empire firmly established, the British stoutly  maintained that intelligent humans were the product of the North European environment.  Tropic peoples were torpid and apathetic.  The harsher conditions of Northern Europe had  forced increased cranial capacity, leading to intelligence.  Brain growth, in their view, had  preceded human bipedalism.  If cranial enlargement was shown to be of British origins, so  much the better.  The Piltdown find was a prime example of that scenario, nearly universally  accepted as fitting into the preconceived assumption.<br />When a tiny skull found in 1925 in South Africa indicated that a human ancestor walked  upright over a million years ago, there was consternation.  Modern human roots couldn't be  African and bipedalism before intelligence seemed outlandish.  The Taung Child, however,  couldn't be refuted, increasing the attention to African origins.  Louis Leakey led the  campaign and his many striking finds captured headlines and brought notoriety.  And  funding.  More importantly, the new discoveries at last made it possible to begin drawing  lines of human descent.  While the Leakey team disclosures pushed the age of human origins  into a more distant past, it was Johanson's discovery of an unusually complete skeleton that  rocked the world.  Finding ancestral human more than three million years old unseated the  Leakey team as the leading paleoanthropological group and catapulted Johanson to the top.<br />Johanson's account of making the find and his subsequent discoveries makes vivid reading.  His outlook is modest enough, admitting to uncommon luck and the support of a talented  team.  He also shows the value of  perseverance in his field.  None of this detracts from the  science and the struggle he and Tim White endured in presenting Lucy as a likely ancestor to  us.  The later clash with the Leakey family was disconcerting at a time when some unity was  needed to establish the path human evolution has taken.  All these circumstances are related  without rancour, done in a highly effective homey style.  Johanson's respect is deserved, both  as a writer and field researcher.<br />The shining jewel in this account remains the description of a seminar given to Johanson's  graduate students by Owen Lovejoy.  Lovejoy, an expert in animal locomotion, gives the  clearest brief account of the course of human evolution yet offered.  In a mere twenty-some  pages, he shows how humans departed from other primates in bipedalism, sexual and child- rearing habits leading to modern family and community relationships.  If for nothing else, this  essay gives this book inestimable value.  It remains unmatched, and belongs on the shelf of  anyone interested in our origins.scent.

Dealing with such giants in the field of  paleoanthropology as Mary and Richard Leakey, Don Johanson and others would be  daunting to anyone lacking the confidence in his abilities.  His aptitude is clear to the reader  as he walks a tightrope in presenting the complex topics involved in this story.  Nearly all the  persona are still with us, and it's to Lewin's credit that he manages to compose this story  without blackening anyone's reputation.<br />Tracing the line of our ancestors is becoming an increasingly involved process.  From skimpy  fossil records, scattered over remote locations around the globe, researchers are striving to  understand which line depicts the path of our evolution and which branches have split off to  expire without further contribution.  Once the evidence lay with bones, how they were  formed, changed, and contributed to resulting modern humans.  Lewin recounts that the  fossil record is no longer enough, and advanced technologies can tease out answers from the  most subtle clue.<br />Lewin's account of Misia Landau's study of paleoanthropologists as perpetrators of &quot;hero  myths&quot; is a splendid beginning.  Because the basic issue is: &quot;how did we become the way we  are&quot;, then all the stories on human evolution begin at the end - today's human.  The &quot;big  names&quot; in the field each addressed this question with vigour.  Each interpreted the evidence  with force, but not always based on what the evidence warranted.  It surely follows that  &quot;contention&quot; is an inevitable result.  There simply weren't enough fossils to realistically trace  the human lineage.<br />Using Landau's ideas as a foundation, Lewin traces the history of thinking on human  evolution through paleoanthropology's leading figures.  From Raymond Dart's Taung Child  through the Ramapithecus, Lewin depicts how many paths have been drawn of the human  lineage by able workers.  New evidence has forced constant revision.  For years, the most  notable revisionist was the Leakey family, Louis, Mary and Richard.  The Leakey's finds kept  urging the origins of humans into a remoter past.  A very remote past.  A past abruptly  truncated by Don Johanson's find of Lucy, and by the introduction of new technologies.<br />Lewin takes us through the problems of dating fossils and tracing evolutionary paths with  superior journalist's skill.  Tracing elusive chemicals and microscopic tracks in rock crystals  shouldn't make for heady reading.  Lewin, following Landau, demonstrates how the science  can be clouded by personalities and ambitions.  The KBS Tuff chapters don't become mired in  technology, but give the research a human, if not always pleasant, aspect.  Lewin shows  clearly how the controversies must be endured in order to present the clearest picture of how  humanity evolved.  This is a highly informative book, written from a fervent interest in the  topic.  You cannot help being drawn into the story.in depicts how many paths have been drawn of the human  lineage by able workers.  New evidence has forced constant revision.

The validity of the first quest is nearly  obscured by her pursuit of the other.  Americans bear a world reputation for their obsession  over toilets in other countries.  Hanny's frequent assessment of amenities in the Sudan and  elsewhere becomes tediously repetitive.  One is tempted to ask the location of the return ticket  and why it wasn't put to use.  Such carping is no longer acceptable, however, and it becomes  our duty to cheer her perseverance and fortitude as she continues to address the more  important issue.<br />She deserves full marks for describing the ubiquity and impact of the Barbaric Practice.  With  roots in many cultures reaching back into a dim past, female 'circumcision' is broadly  practiced in Africa and elsewhere.  Hanny Klein takes us through many tours of towns and  villages, all the while making certain we understand how shabbily African women are  treated.  It's all a novelty to her, and we are led to share her confusion and anxiety.  It's not a  pleasant picture and she paints it with the bleakest possible hues.<br />Along the way through Africa, we are also given numerous insights into her life.  Raised in  Germany, she went to New York to teach in Inner City [read slum] schools.  Her relations  with her father beggar description and she was despised by her mother.  It's not an auspicious  beginning, but it grows worse.  She details her parents' relationship, but passes over her own  marriage in a few sentences.  If she ever had any feelings for the man, they aren't imparted to  us.  She has the tact to avoid laying full blame at his feet, but you can't help but wonder what  prompted the marriage at all.  Given her later description of her sexual predation while  visiting Europe, it's difficult to accept him as the guilty party.

In my Navy days, The Landing Force Manual was the guidebook for transforming sailors into  combat soldiers.  It was a catalogue of techniques teaching bivouacking, patrolling, land  occupation and defense.  Richard Dawkins has unabashedly given us a similar primer useful  in learning to deal with those still resisting Darwin's concept of evolution by natural selection.  Like The Landing Force Manual, River Out of Eden is an arsenal of topics that, once learned,  may be applied in conversational combat with those still resisting the idea that evolution is  the way life works.  With thorough knowledge and captivating style, Dawkins gives us  illuminating examples of how life has achieved what appear to be miracles.<br />Dawkins re-initiated the debate over evolution's mechanics with The Selfish Gene.  For his  lucid explanation of the gene as the foundation for life's workings, he was dubbed The Great  Reductionist by those uncomfortable with the concept that genes tend to override the  treasured idea of &quot;free will&quot; overriding Nature.  With River Out of Eden, Dawkins proves his  ability by presenting an even more comprehensible account of how DNA is the foundation for  life's mechanics.<br />He begins with the idea that all life had ancestors - all of which succeeded in producing  offspring.  Their success at reproducing overshadows the fact that most life forms ultimately  went extinct over the vast span of Earth's time.  Extinction is due to failure to produce  offspring that survived  to further reproduce new generations.  The reasons for this failure are  uncountable and obscure, but the issue remains success or failure.  Tracing the ancestral line  allows us to envision rivers of life.  The rivers aren't composed of water, but of DNA.  DNA  over time, acts as a &quot;digital river&quot; with sections turning on or off in the process of making  proteins.  And proteins are the bricks that build organisms and all their parts.<br />From an almost purely descriptive beginning, Dawkins moves on to demonstrate how many  of those &quot;parts&quot; could evolve over the many millennia available to them.  Among the favourite  organs used to oppose natural selection is &quot;the eye&quot;.  How could such a complex part of life  work half complete?  Well, for starters, better than 49% complete.  A statement that can be  applied to all the body parts in various organisms when viewed over the long stretch of years  available to change gradually.  Wings, finding mates, locating food sources, all the &quot;complex  functions&quot; we see in today's life came from earlier, simpler beginnings.  Dawkins' chapter  &quot;God's Utility Function&quot; is a must read and understand for anyone wishing to comprehend  how many of these features came into existence.  They didn't all arrive in a finished state.<br />Dawkins is adept at illustrating his points.  Among his more clever tricks is the portrayal of a  sentence reading clearly even with different typefaces for each word.  You can still read and  understand the meaning.  But the appearance differs in each case.  He also gives an excellent  account of how genes govern energy expenditure for various types of creatures.  Each has its  own variant, but an &quot;audit&quot; of how the genes benefit from the arrangement reveals why it's a  successful strategy.<br />The key to all these patterns is the idea that somehow, somewhen, a molecule that later  became DNA learned to replicate.  He posits Graham Cairns Smith's suggestion that DNA, or  more likely its precursor, RNA, learned the trick from clay crystals.  This remains the most  likely explanation for life's origins, but requires the reader to recognize that the replicating  molecule preceded any discernible organism.  Cairns Smith's concept removes forever the  idea that life's driving force occurred by chance.  It was a relatively simple chemical and  physical process.  It may not appear elegant, but the mechanism has the eleganceof  plausibility.<br />This whole book carries the argument against &quot;creation by design&quot; into the camp of Darwin's  enemies.  Dawkins lists the contentions of the &quot;creationists&quot;, then adroitly unravels them  through pure logic and good science.  Those who feel daunted by arcane biological treatises  on life need only take up this excellent summation of why Darwin was right.  Those who  quail at the idea DNA drives our existence can take heart.  It's all part of what's required in  achieving a better idea of who we are.  A major step in that understanding is in this book.e of  plausibility.<br />This whole book carries the argument against &quot;creation by design&quot; into the camp of Darwin's  enemies.

Diamond spends the remaining  chapters explaining why the allegation is false.  He does this first by showing how close we  are to the other primates.  He follows that by bringing the human species into a more valid  relationship with the rest of the animal kingdom. He uses the mechanisms of evolution, from  eating habits through language to sexual practices.  The theme of this book is to challenge to  us to reconsider our view of our place in life's panorama.  It's clear that we can no longer hold  ourselves aloof from our relations in the animal kingdom.  When art critics and psychologists  can be deceived by animal-produced art, the claim that &quot;humans are unlike other animals&quot;  rings pretty thin.<br />The range of topics is extensive, and he handles them with a special talent, exercised with  aplomb.  We like to think we are exclusive among animals in having speech, writing,  agriculture and other aspects of &quot;civilization&quot;.  Diamond shows us that those aspects we think  are particular to us are in fact shared by numerous other species.  Ours may be more  pronounced, but they are  not isolated in us.  These abilities differ only in degree, usually  limited by environment or physical capabilities.  But they are the shared result of the  evolutionary process.<br />Diamond has a special talent for the sweeping view.  He's used this aptitude elsewhere, but  perhaps none of his books quite match what he's done here.  Challenging many of our dearly  held beliefs with a refreshing directness, he aptly demonstrates that if we can learn how  evolution works, we'll gain a better understanding of ourselves.  Given our history over the  past four thousand years, our need for this understanding is approaching a critical level.  He  understands where we've been and where we might be going.  There are endless warnings in  this book about what decisions we're making and will make.  We must do them thoughtfully.  But first we must shed the concept that nature &quot;owes&quot; us anything.  The biblical injunction to  &quot;have dominion over the earth&quot; must be abandoned, and quickly.  We share the planet with  millions of other species and must act responsibly.  Otherwise, extinction, and a premature  one, at that, is sure to follow.  How many more of those fellow creatures will we take with us?<br />Those who decry Diamond for &quot;politics&quot; in this book are leading you astray.  It isn't his  politics that Diamond wants you to follow, but ethics.  If there is any aspect of humanity that  can separate us from the other animals, it's in making ethical decisions.  His final chapter  shows our intellect has brought us under two distinct clouds - the nuclear holocaust and the  environmental one.  The first may be slightly subdued, but the second is gaining on us.  We  are destroying natural habitat at an unprecedented rate.  Diamond calls on us all to make  adjustments to reduce and reverse that process.  Whatever else of value this book offers, his  call for common sense and applying the knowledge gained here is invaluable.  If there's a  political element involved here, it's the need for political will to save our species - and the  other chimpanzees and animals we live with.are endless warnings in  this book about what decisions we're making and will make.

Diamond, against all logic, has accomplished this feat, and done it  admirably.  The question, 'why do white people have so much and black people so little?', is a  valid query of increasing importance.  In responding, he describes how humans developed  agriculture, domesticated animals and attained a sedentary life.  This change from a nomadic  hunter-gatherer society led to new diseases.  Immunity to them was later gained only over the  passage of time.  Utilization of natural resources lead to utilization of natural resources to  create superior weapons, allowing settled peoples to become imperialists, an anachronism  considered logically.<br />He anticipates the criticism of 'geographical determinism' certain to be raised, but his case  remains based on several grand geophysical concepts.  He starts with the idea that the East- West axis of Eurasia gave that region many advantages of temperate climate and easy  mobility, as opposed to the Americas' North-South orientation.  He continues with an assessment of the native  fauna of various regions for the likelihood of domestication.  Although little cultural is  discussed here, he describes how small bands of humans grew to villages then larger  agglomerations leading to 'kleptocracies' [a wonderful term!] in which wealth was no longer  evenly distributed.  Such a social structure led to the rise of nation-states which could engage  in greater imperialist enterprises.<br />While Diamond portrays humanity's movements around the globe, some aspects clearly  require further  explanation.  He stipulates that the Americas could have been populated in  less than a millennia.  What prompted such a rapid expansion if game foods were readily  available?  He describes the barriers to cultural exchange throughout Mesoamerica, such as  beasts of burden in the Andes never being merged with Mayan wheels and crops raised  successfully in one area being unsuitable in another.  What drove humans over the isthmus to  another continent?  Did people really move so rapidly over vastly differing environments  while losing communication with their points of origin?<br />In keeping to his broad-brush approach, Diamond avoids cultural issues until the Epilogue.  Only then does he raise Christianity and Islam as imperialist societies in contrast with other  cultures.  It was astonishing to discover that, in the last analysis, Diamond fails to answer the  very question that resulted in this book.  This is not a failure on his part.  He impressively  covers the 'how' of social structures and their impact on what seems to be a natural tendency  for humans to migrate.  Yet, his original question addresses European expansion to other,  already occupied, lands.  Having already absolved capitalism as the motivation, it is  surprising that he ignores the role of Christianity in European imperialism.  Diamond may be  forgiven for avoiding this issue since his analysis focuses on the environmental benefits  Eurasians enjoyed before beginning their global conquest.  But European expansion has had  such an impact on world cultures that motivation requires a more fervent appeal for  resolution than the mild query found at the close of the book.  Still, we can't address that  question properly without the background Diamond has provided.<br />His call for further study is welcome for many reasons.  Anyone involved in international  programs will find this book a useful resource.  It dispels many commonly-held myths still  held even by professionals who deal with 'Third World' countries.  A careful reader will see  questions posed in a new framework and take note of these to their benefit.  His description of  the vast ranges of human movement must now be considered in light of the world's current  trend to balkanization.  Now that we have nowhere to go, in what direction will that heritage  of continuous movement take us?  Read Diamond to provide the necessary background, then  ask yourself these and related questions.  It's well worth the time, and reading him is not a  strenuous task.uous movement take us?

Variation gives life its grandeur, and Richard Dawkins gives us a description of the workings of variation.  Fortunately, with a  sharp mind and sharper wit, he has the ability to deliver this portrayal so that nearly  everyone can understand it.  That's not to say this book is an easy read.  Although he delivers  his narration as if sitting with you in a quiet study, you may still need to review his words  more than once.  That's not a challenge or a chore, it's a pleasure.<br />Dawkins, unlike other science writers, is forthright in declaring his advocacy in writing this  book.  It's a refreshing start to his most serious effort.  After publication of The Selfish Gene  led to a storm of fatuous criticism, Extended Phenotype comes in response with more detail of  how the gene manifests itself in the organism and its environment.  It's clear that Dawkins'  critics, who label him an &quot;Ultra-Darwinist&quot; [whatever that is] haven't read this book.  His  critics frequently argue that The Selfish Gene doesn't operate in a vacuum, but must deal  within some kind of environment, from an individual cell to global scenarios.  Dawkins deftly  responds to critics in describing how genes rely on their environment for successful  replication.  If the replication doesn't survive in the environment it finds itself, then it, and  perhaps its species, will die out.<br />The child's favourite question, &quot;why&quot; is difficult enough for parents and teachers to answer.  Yet, as thinking humans we've become trained to deal with that question nearly every  context.  So well drilled that we consider something for which that question has no answer to  be suspicious if not insidious.  Part of Dawkins presentation here reiterates that there is no  &quot;why&quot; to either the process of evolution nor its results.  It isn't predictable, inevitable or  reasonable.  It's a tough situation to cope with, but Dawkins describes the mechanism with  such precision and clarity, we readily understand &quot;how&quot; if not &quot;why&quot; evolution works.  We  comprehend because Dawkins does such an outstanding job in presenting its mechanics.<br />This edition carries three fine finales: Dawkins well thought out bibliography, a glossary, and  most prized, indeed, an Afterword by Daniel C. Dennett.  If any defense of this book is  needed, Dennett is a peerless champion for the task.  Dennett's capabilities in logical  argument are superbly expressed here.  As he's done elsewhere {Darwin's Dangerous Idea],  Dennett mourns the lack of orginality and logic among Dawkins' critics.  Excepting the more  obstinate ones, these seem to be falling by the wayside.  It's almost worthwhile reading  Dennett's brief essay before starting Dawkins.  It would be a gift to readers beyond measure if  these two ever collaborated on a book.e mechanism with  such precision and clarity, we readily understand &quot;how&quot; if not &quot;why&quot; evolution works.

In DARWIN'S DANGEROUS IDEA [a must read], Daniel C. Dennett delicately sidesteps the  question of why Niles Eldredge and Stephen Gould have held so tenaciously to their thesis of  evolution's progress by 'punctuated equilibrium'.  Niles Eldredge has saved him the trouble.  In this book, Eldredge simply states he 'saw no prospect of making further contribution to  understanding evolution' without some novel interpretation.  It would take a 'novel way'  which he claims to have found in 'evolutionary patterns in the grand scale of geologic time.'<br />Eldredge presents his arguments in the tones of a petulant schoolboy.  John Maynard Smith's  welcoming paleontologists to the 'High Table' of evolutionary discussion sets his theme.  Eldredge eagerly accepts the invitation.  This  posture seems bizarre for an American in view  of the fact that the concept is entirely a tradition among English university dons.  Eldredge's  acceptance reads like someone striving for recognition, immediately treating the elevation as a  signal to commence a fierce debate.  From the outset of the book a theme of 'us versus them'  prevails.  For Eldredge, the 'us' are referred to as 'naturalists' giving the reader the impression  of an elderly, tweed clad field tramper, peering through thick eye glasses in a virtuous quest  for truth.  Given that 'Naturalist' is the title of Edward Wilson's memoir, it gives one pause.  Wilson devised sociobiology, which Eldredge passionately detests.  The other side of the  'High Table' are quickly labelled with the pejorative 'Ultra-Darwinist', although how anyone  can be 'beyond Darwin' remains elusive.<br />As with his colleague Gould, the primary target remains Richard Dawkins.  Grouping  Dawkins and his associates as 'reductionist' for using the gene as the basis of evolutionary  processes [which it is], Eldredge tries to turn the 'selfish gene' concept into something sordid -  gene replication requires sexual selection.  As he puts it, 'the way is now paved for  interpreting all manner of organismic activity as devices to forward this competitive race'.  And so it is.  Eldredge counters by claiming that an organism eats first, then reproduces.  That  is certainly true, but a broader view displays the hitch, which Eldredge conveniently  overlooks, that full stomach or not, if the reproduction doesn't happen, neither does  evolution.  Eldredge and Gould have both skipped over the fact that the gene must not just  replicate, its 'vehicle' must survive in the environment in which it exists.  Replication and  reproduction must continue over time for a species to become something the paleontologist  can find and identify.  If the host either doesn't survive or reproduce, the gene goes extinct.  Enough failure leads to extinction of a large group of individuals - a species.<br />The punctuated equilibriasts have difficulty with the concept of 'species'.  They're not alone in  that, but Eldredge has a particular problem.  Spending a long chapter defending punctuated  equilibrium which some loose descriptions of speciation, he finally arrives at the definition  given by Ernst Mayr and Theodosius Dobzhansky over 50 years ago.  They argued that  members of a species which can't interbreed are separate species.  Individual members of a  'species' change genetic identity with each generation.  At some later point in time individuals  can no longer mate with previous ones - a new species has evolved.  That point in time  remains undefined because each species adapts to environments with varying rates.  Identifying a 'species' becomes inherently difficult, leading George Williams to declare  'species' has little or value in identifying fossils.  Species can only be identified in a snapshot  of time.<br />What has always impaired 'punctuated equilibrium' is the failure to provide a proper time  scale for assessing speciation.  Eldredge is able to extend that fault to the point of taking  someone else's findings and simply saying,in effect, 'Oh, you interpreted that evidence the  wrong way!'  His worst example is citing Peter Sheldon's monumental study of trilobites, and  simply contending Sheldon misread the data, claiming his analysis is 'minor tinkering' with  Eldredge's idea of 'stasis' in the record.<br />Eldredge, like his colleague, relies heavily on Elizabeth Vrba's 'turnover pulse' device to  describe rapid speciation and extinction.  Both Gould and Eldredge are masters of slinging  about similar Madison Avenue quips in place of evidence.  It's enough to make you think they  missed their true calling.  Slogans are catchy memes, but poor science.  Using fossil snapshots  doesn't refute either Dawkins or Dennett that a fuller analysis would destroy these supposed  quick speciation events.  Like Darwin, the P.E. team is faced with an incomplete fossil record.  Unlike Darwin, they think this represents a valid picture of evolution.  As in previous works,  however, Eldredge produces no real evidence in support of the contention.<br />The value of this book lies in Eldredge's summary of the players in the 'High Table'  discussions.  It's also a memoir of how punctuated equilibrium's team presents their case.  Eldredge, to his credit, doesn't wander as far afield as his team mate.  His writing is clear,  even if his logic is flawed.  The book is worth a read, but if you haven't bought Dennett, go to  that page NOW and spend your money.

Robert Bakker has given us one of the best examples of this technique.  In The Dinosaur Heresies, Bakker presented a beautifully written, but highly detailed, account of the likely scenarios of dinosaur existence.  The full range of dinosaur life was described with elegant care, overlaid with Bakker's fine wit.  But the wealth of information in that book may have deterred some readers from delving into what was basically a serious description.  Here, Bakker's simply dumped much of the scientific annotation to provide a similar depiction of dinosaur life.<br />Raptor Red incorporates a recent find of a large predatory dinosaur.  Having positioned the find with its cognomen, Utahraptor, Bakker weaves a highly plausible tale of likely events in this creature's life.  Cleverly portraying Raptor Red as female, he gives the &quot;character&quot; a wider range of experiences.  Most of these are fully credible based on the increased knowledge gained by teams of paleontologists and volunteers.  For example, recent finds indicate dinosaurs, unlike most of today's reptiles, probably stayed with nestlings after the hatch.  Bakker has done a credible job in working in this concept and other revisionist thinking about probable dinosaur behaviour.<br />We must be careful in assessing whether Bakker has taken liberties with levels of dinosaur intelligence.  Science has revealed unexpected mental capacity in the minute fruit fly [see  Jonathan Weiner's Time, Love, Memory for a fascinating account].  Dinosaurs reigned over the planet for over 150 million years.  That's a fine testimonial to their adaptability and capacity for survival.  Bakker acknowledges this aptitude at the story's opening by  introducing the raptor as a migratory species entering a new territory.  From this beginning he goes on to give the raptor emotional capacity, environmental awareness, and almost love.  While flirting lightly with anthropomorphism, Bakker deftly maintains the creature's reptilian identity.  It's a fine line, but he manages it without granting the animal more intellect than it deserves.  He must find a way to impart motivation and without some means of doing so, we wouldn't have had the story.

Esme Weatherwax as an author's agent is a formidable figure.  As if this transformation wasn't enough, she also becomes a patron of opera.<br />Pratchett's gone slightly awry from his usual path with this book.  He raises a host of pretty serious questions with the characters and the plot.  It's still in the best of PTerry's style - his wit through the persona of Granny and Nanny Ogg has, if anything, improved.  But there are some issues uncommon in Discworld books, and the reader is left more than just entertained.  There's some post-laughter thinking required of the reader.

Ever since E.O. Wilson's Sociobiology, the biological role of  behaviour is being earnestly scrutinized.  Calamity howlers may regret that the concept of  &quot;free will&quot; isn't as absolute as they might like, but there is clearly some link between our  chemistry and our actions.  Hamer and Copeland have brought together a summary of the  most recent research in this field.<br />Selecting a group of major behaviour areas, they relate how studies have shown correlations  between genetics and personality.  The focus is on comparative and correlated actions in  twins.  With increasing numbers of studies of twin behaviour in different environments being  conducted around the world, the presentation is more than a little convincing.  Most  significantly, this book confronts us with questions that must be addressed.  Hamer and  Copeland don't attempt to claim that this book provides any final answers to the relationship  of genes with our habits.  They do ask us to review our thinking about the issue.  It's vital  work in the effort to find out who we are.<br />Hamer and Copeland remind us that we're biological creatures, not minds being carried  around by bodies.  For decades zoologists described animal activity as &quot;instincts, secure in the  belief that animals could be trained, but not taught.  Genetic research has shown this outlook  is misleading.  Living With Our Genes is the flip side of that view in showing human activity  has strong biological roots.  They accomplish this without adopting the absolutist view  exhibited by earlier researchers.<br />Going beyond simple statistics of behaviour patterns, they delve into the findings of  geneticists who've identified specific gene expressions in the body.  That our cells produce  numerous chemical compounds is old news.  A wide spectrum of pharmaceuticals is available  to counteract or enhance a number of these chemical signals.  What is only now coming to  light, as Hamer and Copeland point out, is how these compounds work on the body and why.<br />In their chapter on worry they discuss the research on serotonin, the &quot;genetic Prozac&quot;.  It turns  out that in one segment of our DNA, there are more or less copies of the serotonin transporter  gene.  Such genes are naturally inheritable, giving a segment of the population a trend toward  anxiety.  Anger, and its expression in violence is another area of common concern.  The  authors provide an extensive description of various forms of anger expression.  They stress  that anger can be controlled - genetic expression is important, but not an absolute.  As with  anxiety, serotonin and its by-products provided an important clue in the study of violence.<br />Molecular genetics has accomplished an incredible  amount in the fifty years since the  structure of DNA was revealed.  Hamer's extensive bibliography is an indication of how  much work has been achieved.  Today the research is expanding into a new field called  behavioural genetics.  As one of the first understandable accounts of what's been and what  needs to be done, it should be placed on your shelf alongside Matt Ridley's Genome.a number of these chemical signals.

That's not surprising, although finding enough shelf space for two dozen  Discworld books must be a challenge.  Witches Abroad is one Discworld tome deserving a  permanent niche on any shelf - especially yours.  You'll return to it often.<br />The clash between established experience and youthful endeavor is caught here in Pratchett's  matchless style.  Granny Weatherwax, Lancre's predominate headologist, is severely  challenged by the youngest member of the coven, Magrat Garlick.  Magrat's heir to a  powerful device and honour - a fairy godmother's wand.  Magrat's life is further complicated  by an identity crisis.  She's not always comfortable in her role in life, and this new  responsibility compounds the problem.  Nevertheless, she's been given the wand and a  charge to prevent a marriage.  A formidable task, given that the marriage is to occur in &quot;forn  parts&quot;.<br />The witches' journey to Genua is one of the highlights of Pratchett's inventive mind.  Esme's  participation in a Cripple Mister Onion contest along the way would make the most ardent  card player shudder in recognition.  The innocent Granny exhibiting &quot;beginner's luck&quot; is  priceless.<br />Pratchett introduces us to the power of the story in the universe.  Stories &quot;play themselves&quot;,  shaping people's actions to their own ends.  People who resist their roles in stories do so at  their peril.  This story, so classic and well established, should be irresistible, but then it hasn't  dealt with Esme Weatherwax.  The struggle is immense, with mighty powers brought to bear  in seeking a resolution.  Only time will tell which has the greater power.<br />Most of Pratchett's stories have the value of being timeless.  Among the Discworld tales, this  one has a particular ageless quality.  It can be read at any time with many levels of pleasure  and value.  No other book in the witches' Discworld series quite matches this one for  confirming the worth of Esme Weatherwax as one of Pratchett's finest character inventions.

Memoirs have great value in  giving us a picture of the thoughts about his life and how the world is seen.  In an earlier age  diaries, with their daily entries provided contemporary records and reflections.  Today's pace  of life has made the daily journal outmoded.  Memoirs are usually conceived in a later time of  life, and time-eroded memories sometimes vague or disoriented.<br />Barney Panofsky has produced a modern memoir.  After a long life, he's reflecting on the  vagaries of his journey.  He's experienced some wonderful highs offset by almost  overwhelming depths.  An aspiring writer who's made his pilgrimage to the Left Bank of  Paris, his &quot;career&quot; became making cheap films.  No matter, he ultimately became wealthy  from it, but the old adage about wealth and happiness rings with harsh truth.  Without formal  education, he quotes classics fluently, his self-taught skills brought out with wit and force.  Hanging over this relation of a complex man is the loss of his friend and rival, &quot;Boogie&quot;  Moscovitch.  Did Barney really kill him?  The trial scene mocks the legal process, bringing to  mind a bevy of lawyer anecdotes.  All of this is related in Richler's commanding wit, tinted  with his own ongoing quest for justice and virtue, mainstays of his life and writing.<br />The question immediately arises - is this Barney's memoir or Richler's?  That really isn't our  business.  What counts is how well Richler presents his character, whether semi-fictional or  wholly invented.  And Richler's Barney is flawlessly portrayed.  A complex man of conflicting  emotions, values, accomplishments, he cries out for recognition that his struggle with life  makes him a peer to any man.  In the words of Low's cartoon soldier &quot;The hell this isn't the  most important hole in the world!  I'm in it!&quot;  So we aren't to judge either whether Barney  truly represents Richler, but how convincingly Richler has portrayed Barney.  The old clich&eacute;s,  &quot;tragi-comic&quot; or &quot;flawed hero&quot; hover about seeking expression, but labelling Barney or his  creator is doomed to failure.  Both are far too complex for such simple thinking.<br />Richler's superb wit keeps alive a story that might have descended into a mundane relation of  a man wallowing in self pity.  Barney feels the creeping debilitation of Alzheimer's, to which  he ultimately succumbs.  It's not a pleasant experience for him or the sympathetic reader.  Richler isn't looking for sympathy for Barney or for himself.  He's portraying life as it is, and  Richler, through Barney is providing us with a warning.<br />Richler's a discriminating social observer and this book covers a lifetime.  As a memoir of the  mid-twentieth century, the historical aspect seems skimpy, but all the elements are present.  The departure from similar accounts reflects what many find uncomfortable; Jews in North  America are a sub-community within a population versed in ideals of consensus.  Barney's  view of life and the world is from that perspective.  He moves in and out of the WASP and  Jewish segments of society, but always returns to those roots he understands best, even when  tragedy remains such a major part of that culture.<br />Readers shouldn't make too much of Richler/Panofsky's Canadian Jewish origins.  This is a  book of universal significance.  Casting Richler as &quot;a Canadian writer&quot; as some do is to  deprive him of proper recognition of his world view.  He's even more than a North American  writer, but one who conveys earnestly the trials life presents us all.  Someone here attested to  their disappointment that this book failed to cop a Booker.  It's a valid complaint.  Perhaps a  greater award will be forthcoming.  It's overdue.how convincingly Richler has portrayed Barney.

Books	4	2	5	N	N	Neither: Bad Title	David Raup collaborated with Jack Sepkowski in suggesting Earth's been bashed by comets  periodically, almost predictably.  The research suggested that we take a harder look at  extinction than has been done previously.  He thinks we avoid looking at extinction as too  frightening.  Since it logically applies as much to ourselves as to all those species lost in the  remote stretches of time, it's a valid argument.  But it happens, and we should educate  ourselves on extinction's record.<br />Raup tries to further our education with a fine description of the fossil record.  His depiction  of the Ediacaran and Cambrian eras is a joy to read.  Few have provided such a vivid account  in so little space.  His account of the Cambrian gives laudatory credit to Gould's Wonderful  Life.  That Gould's analysis has been devastated by later research doesn't detract from what  Raup's given us.  His presentations are intelligible and vividly depicted.<br />He presents some numerical models, citing genus and species counts of various extinction  scenarios.  His graphical presentation of the &quot;kill curve&quot; is designed to show high percentage  population losses are rare events.  He defends his catastrophist thesis with accounts of near- extinctions from which species recovered.  Except for attributable human intervention, he  argues, &quot;the chances of a field biologist catching a species at the instant of global extinction are  small&quot;.  Quite true, but his assertion fails to reflect that &quot;speciation&quot; is a term devoid of clear  definition.  We can't determine whether a current species could successfully reproduce with  individuals from an earlier time.<br />In his look at catastrophic extinction, Raup takes some sidelong swipes at  gradualism in the  evolutionary process.  While he's correct in asserting we need to understand extinction better  than we do, his assault on gradualism is misplaced.  By limiting his view, he's ignored the role  of adaptation in species creation and extinction.  He states that there's no known reason why a  species couldn't live forever.  This is fallacious since the world is constantly changing and  species must adapt or go extinct.  There's no such thing as a &quot;bad gene&quot;, there are only genes  which survive change, or don't.  When enough don't the species disappears.  Perhaps he  should have entered into another collaboration, this time with a biologist.<br />What Raup has contributed to extinction debates is the need to look more closely at the  correlation between significant geologic [or cosmic] events and species loss.  A reasonable  undertaking and Raup presents a wealth of reasoned evidence for many extinctions.  He  presents a list of &quot;exotic&quot; causes of extinctions, finding few of them statistically convincing.  His conclusion is that those earth-bashing comets and meteorites need further investigation.  Craters, the only physical evidence of cosmic impact, are elusive subjects for study.  They  weather, are erased by continental subduction and may lie undersea.  The recent discovery of  the Chicxulub crater in the Caribbean wasn't sought by paleontologists.  But Raup must have  rejoiced at the find.  It's apparently from the bolide that coincides with the extinction of the  dinosaurs.  It certainly supports his contention that the Big Five extinctions are the results of  cosmic impacts.<br />Raup did himself a disservice in choosing Stephen J. Gould to write the Introduction to this  book.  Gould's &quot;punctuated equilibrium&quot; concept has simply proven little more than a feeble  attempt at Darwin bashing.  His assertion that Charles Lyell's &quot;credo makes little sense&quot; is  outrageous.  It's a self-serving comment attempting to indirectly shore up his failed thesis.  Geologic processes don't operate in fits and starts.  Even Raup, further in the text, recounts  that in our lifetimes we're unlikely to witness continents moving, suffer catastrophic  earthquakes or be struck by meteors.  Gould's statement so early on nearly caused the book to  be put aside unread.  Pity.  It's worth a read.ic  earthquakes or be struck by meteors.

We are given Behe's personal snapshots of some of the complexities of life.  He labels these snapshots with his frustrations, unable to understand how they developed.  He wants  the rest of science to give him some quick, simple answers.  Since, according to him  they aren't forthcoming, he offers the least credible solution yet proposed by an American  anti-Darwinist.<br />Behe's focus is on features of life he calls items of &quot;irreducible complexity&quot;.  This vague term  applies to old arrows in the anti-Darwin arsenal: the eye [please note &quot;the&quot;], blood clotting,  cilia, cell structure and other wonders.  To Behe, such things cannot exist in a partially  completed state, but can only be finished and fully functional.  Since he hasn't the biology to  understand how evolution operates over vast stretches of time, it's not surprising he finds  these wonders inexplicable.  His focus on &quot;the&quot; eye, to take one example, is restricted to  human eyes.  He's totally unaware [although the literature is full of reports he claims are  missing] that &quot;the&quot; eye has independently evolved more than forty times [yes, 40!] using nine  different structures.  He's never read Nilsson and Pelger, although they published eight years  prior to Behe's book, who showed how the eye could evolve within half a million years.  Using the  human eye as a prime example is risky, since its structure is backwards!  If there's a &quot;designer&quot;  behind that lot, it should go back to engineering school, or more appropriately, take up  divinity studies.<br />Behe calls the cell the &quot;ultimate black box&quot;.  He then goes on to flirt with various parts of the  cell, all of which have origins in the remote past.  How cellular components could have  evolved is beyond him, so he simply argues that they all came together in completed form.  Any attempts to show how these elements could have evolved are brushed away with the  broom of &quot;irreducible complexity&quot;, in Behe's hands the ultimate weapon.  He strives to  discredit Urey and Miller's 1950's research on the formation of amino acids in earth's early  atmosphere.  He cites numerous critics of their work but doesn't even list their papers.  He  fails to mention that their work was done before Watson and Crick revealed the structure of  DNA, which fundamentally changed ideas on how early life was formed.  For example, Behe  ignores  Graham Cairns Smith's work on replicating molecules, a fine model of the origins of  RNA/DNA, since it totally invalidates the idea of &quot;irreducible complexity&quot;.<br />Behe's solution to questions about life's complexities, all answerable by natural selection, he  grants to a &quot;designer&quot;.  In his hands this solution is worse than ignorant; it's simply coy.  Coy  in the sense that Behe's attempting to deceive us.  He flirts with this designer, but fails to  identify it.  That's simply fraudulent.  If you were to suggest to him the designer is Japan's  Amaterasu, the Australian Aborigine's Baiame, or the Hindu's Vishnu, you would likely get a  blank look in response.  So, although Behe lacks the courage to say it outright, we have to  assume it's the designer his target market recognizes, the Judeo-Christian Sprite, known  variously as [g]od, Yahweh, the Lord or whoever.  Although Behe is a avowed Catholic, this  book spouts the American Protestant anti-Darwin line so scrupulously that we're led to  wonder if he's not opting for conversion.<br />Daniel C. Dennett has warned us against imparting motivation to anti-Darwin writers.  However, it's valid to ask what market a writer seeks to reach, since that's likely to reveal  much about motivation.  Michael Behe, terrified of the complexity of life, wants simple  answers to how life works.  With this book, he's clearly tapped into similar feelings among his  fellow Americans.  Complaining that science has failed to answer his concerns, his solution  simply precludes further effort to gain the answers.  If the &quot;designer&quot; did all these wonderful  things, why delve into life in attempting to trace original causes?  That fallacious thinking is  precisely what is impairing North American education today, when, as he notes, so few text  books adequately cover evolution as a topic.  Behe's book and its popularity will only further  hamper the opportunity for our children to learn about life.his  fellow Americans.

Who are the good ones, and who the bad?  Once  we had monarchs, presidents, explorers, all good and/or bad with some migration from the  first to the second.  In Sam Vimes, we may have a unique example of the reverse.<br />When we first met Sam Vimes in GUARDS! GUARDS!, he was sodden in a gutter, soddin'  drunk.  Hardly an auspicious beginning for a heroic figure.  Discworld heroes are often  found in unusual circumstances, rarely admirable at first sight.  Sam's a copper, Commander  of Ankh-Morpork's Night Watch.  It's a job to send any man's hand groping for support, even  if the brace is in the form of a bottle.  Now he's on his way to Uberwald.  Trolls, Dwarves and  Werewolves have all emigrated from this region, taking up residence in Sam's city.  He hasn't  shed his resentment at this intrusion, nor his suspicion of these bizarre life forms.  His earlier  cultural challenges came from the likes of Klatchians, who were at least human.  The Patrician  has made him a diplomat, a real challenge for a man with so little tact.  He must deal with all  these creatures he resents.  Failure to deal successfully may result in his becoming part of the  local cuisine.<br />Sam has an advantage over many of us.  Strongly self-aware, he manages to control his  temper and intemperance.  He's pulled himself out of the gutter.  Now the Duke of Ankh- Morpork, he's married into the city's aristocracy.  His diplomatic skills are going to be put to  severe tests.  To ease the pressure, Sam is accompanied by his recently acquired spouse, Sybil  Ramkin.  Her presence with him on this venture is an indication of his newly elevated status,  and recognition of her well established one.  Ironically, Sam is also supported by some of his  mates from the Watch, Detritus the Troll and forensic expert Cheery Littlebottom, a Dwarf.  Both are originally from the Uberwald.  Sam's diplomatic assignment is a commercial treaty  and attendance of the Coronation of the Low King.  Regrettably, not all Uberwald is happy  with the new monarch, and Sam is drawn into a miasma of plots and counter plots no  diplomat should enter.<br />Sam Vimes is anything but a hero of the ideal romantic stamp.  His blemishes are apparent,  but, to his credit, he recognizes them and deals with them.  His temper, which he controls  with effort,  leads him into difficult situations.  His prejudices blind him to unexpected values  in people [and, in this case, a scruffy dog], but when he finally recognizes the truth, he  acknowledges it.  Maybe  with glum grace, but without rancor.  Pratchett has drawn him as a  strikingly real figure.  He's unique on the Discworld.  And that's sad in one sense because  both the Discworld and our world could do with more like him.<br />Pratchett's plots have never been overly convoluted or difficult to unravel.

Bereft of a homeland, this  accursed wraith crosses the landscape again and again, often as not bringing some tragedy or  distress in his wake.  Seen as the symbol of the Jewish Diaspora, the wanderer is the subject of  suspicion, fear and accusation.  This solitary and often tragic figure gives rise to repression  and becomes the justification for unspeakable acts, of which the 20th Century Holocaust is  merely the latest and best known.<br /><br />Mordecai Richler has given us an astonishing and riveting account of one of these wanderers  as he might have appeared in North America.  As a child, Montrealer Moses Berger  encounters the Gursky family.  It's the first step in what will become an almost heroic quest  for the truth behind the Gursky family's shadowy ancestor, Ephraim Gursky and the  grandson, Solomon, who accompanied him on a journey in Canada's North.  Ephraim, against  all reason, apparently shipped aboard the HMS Erebus with John Franklin's ill-starred  expedition into the Arctic.  Richler demonstrates the Christian attitude toward the Jews with  accounts of the many searchers for Franklin's remains.  Those necrophiles uniformly scoffed  at the notion a Jew could have been aboard, let alone survived, since \\"all know\\" these urban  dwellers wouldn't have the fortitude or presumption to attempt such a feat.  The evidence,  however, suggests . . .<br /><br />Richler has woven a rich tapestry with this mixture of invention and history.  He does it so  well that separating the threads of fact and fiction becomes an insurmountable task.  And  why not?  He's given us a unique picture of the world's second largest nation.  A fresh picture  indeed, given that the nation of \\"two solitudes\\" conveniently forgets those of its number who  are neither English nor French.  If Ephraim Gursky sailed with Franklin and initiated a  dynasty of Inuit Jews with such names as Gor-ski, Girskee, or Goorski.  They wander, like  their mentor, into the southern lands wearing, against all reason [again!] Jewish prayer  shawls.  They seem as homeless as their cantor, fulfilling, even in these outlandish  circumstances, the Christian prejudice against wandering Jews.<br /><br />Homeless he may be, but rootless the Wandering Jew is not.  No matter where they settled,  the Jews brought an endless capacity for adaptation, seizing whatever opportunities emerged  to assist in their survival.  Wherever they settled, they viewed it as \\"the next best place\\".  The  homeland of Israel remained within their consciousness, but they would do the best they  could in whichever land they occupied.  In the Gursky's case, circumstances kept opportunity  at bay until Americans, in a flush of Protestant fervour, enacted Prohibition, almost certainly  one of the least honoured pieces of federal legislation ever enacted.  This was the moment the  Gursky clan was able to seize, starting from minimal beginnings to emerge as a mighty  empire built from alcohol.  Richler has again merged fantasy with reality as his account of this  aspect of the Gursky family would be better spelt \\"Bronfman\\".<br /><br />Mordecai Richler's inventive mind and well-honed writing skills have provided us with a true  masterpiece.  He knows people, certainly the Montreal Jewish community, but far beyond  that urban confine also.  He takes us to the Arctic, the Prairies, flirts with England, pokes into  America.  The only missing scene is Van Dieman's Land [Tasmania], where Ephraim Gursky  arrived as a transportee only two years before Franklin arrived as governor.  These, however,  are simply locations in which Richler can place his people.  His cast is enormous, but he  handles the lot with unmatched skill, presenting every persona as fully credible.  We may not  know the Jewish community intimately, but reading this book is an excellent means of  viewing that community and how it sees the world.  Moses Berger's quest for theGursky  story makes him the pivot around which this superb novel orbits as he encounters the key  players in the story - especially the Wandering Jew.<br /><br />It's good to see this book restored back in print.  That gives more people an  opportunity to comprehend Richler's absolute mastery of story-telling and conveying moods.  He remains Canada's leading writing talent.

Of all Pratchett's brilliantly drawn characters, Samuel Vimes stands unique in providing a  realistic role model for the rest of us.  He's honest, forthright, deeply suspicious of aristocracy,  and best of all, despises the idea of kings.  The last is important here, for someone wishes the  return of the Ankh-Morpork monarchy.  And Sam Vimes' remote ancestor, Old Stoneface,  executed the last one.<br />Edward d'Eath [how does PTerry come up with these names?!], an impoverished aristocrat,  seeks fulfillment of his destiny by restoring the monarchy.  Recruiting fellow lords to his  cause proves difficult.  It's been a long time since the last king, and the Patrician runs the city  with commendable, if frightening, efficiency.  So Edward embarks on a solitary campaign.<br />Pratchett's inventive mind takes us from the &quot;fantasy&quot; genre into the murder mystery domain.  Murder isn't a common event on the Discworld, and its occurrence here creates an intensity of  feeling rarely evoked by Pratchett's works.  Vimes is particularly irritated by such abhorrent  events as murder.  Assassination is bad enough, although carefully regulated by its Guild.  For Vimes, murder is too arbitrary.  It reflects the one aspect of society he resents the most, the  exercise of absolute power.  He's affronted both as a copper and a man.<br />Partly inspired by Corporal Carrot, Vimes is no longer content having the Watch &quot;let things lie  anymore&quot;.  Forces that used to push a drunken Vimes into the gutter are forces he now resists,  even struggles to overcome.  It's an inspiring read watching Pratchett give Vimes a new sense  of dedication.  Vimes has always sought justice, and his recent rise in society and the Watch  has given him fresh impetus, and clout, to gain it.  However, first he must survive.  He's up  against a new force.  A force of absolute power, without soul or pity - the Gonne.<br />There are other aspects in this book beyond the new Old Stoneface trying to catch a murderer.  Pratchett pays homage to the struggle for women's and immigrants' rights in Britain [and  elsewhere].  The Watch has been compelled to recruit dwarves, trolls and, um, a woman.  Sergeant Colon's attempts to reconcile size, attitudes and anatomy with a traditional human,  male, role must bring tears to the eyes of all recruiting sergeants reading it.  Pratchett's  sympathetic view of Angua pays homage to the efforts of women striving to enter men's  realms.  But for a novel view of the world we all inhabit, there's few that can out-express  Gaspode, one of Pratchett's finest creations.<br />Pratchett possesses a superior ability to create timeless works.  Nestled in this library since its  publication, this book is taken up as an old friend for repeated enjoyment.  There's nothing  lost in re-reading Men At Arms - the issues remain timely, the characters worth noting -  sometimes emulating, and the wit undiminished.  If you're new to Pratchett, this is a fine  place to start.  If you're coming along in the Discworld sequence, be prepared for an item of  exceptional value, something beyond the humorous fantasy of wizards, witches and Mort's  employer.ying to catch a murderer.

David Quammen's Song of the Dodo led me in search of his other writings.  The first reward of that quest was this book.  A collection of essays from an  illustrious writer with keen perception, Quammen casts his perceptive eye  on a range of topics from arachnids to zoology.  While an anthology lacks  Song's comprehensive view, these articles are timeless.  Quammen's  writing evokes many levels of emotional and intellectual response.<br />The Introduction sets the tone: &quot;A Mouse Is Miracle Enough&quot;.  From this  opening we tour the wonders of nature, with a couple of side trips to  observe that strangest of animals, Homo sapiens.  Quammen's gaze never  ceases surveying the landscape in presenting us with things we didn't  know or aspects of viewing we've not considered.  While the very  squeamish may balk at close examination of black widow spiders, spoon  worms or scorpions, Quammen is adept at taking us gently to these  confrontations.  As he does, he asks us to reconsider our viewpoint of these  and other creatures.  We must learn to deal with &quot;faces unlike ours&quot; and  shed prejudices even if shedding the fears is more difficult.  Changing fear  into respect is the first step in acknowledging our sharing this planet with  other creatures and stepping back from the destructive role we've adopted.<br />Respect for life is the underlying theme of all Quammen's nature writings.  His &quot;sidelong view of nature&quot; takes us along remote jungle and desert  paths to watch and record life's activities.  While we like to set ourselves  apart from the rest of life, Quammen, with facile pressure, pulls us along  with him to observe our cousins.  And ourselves.  Deserts, it seems, are a  haven for more than scorpions and Beaded Lizards.  Among the many  nocturnal animals hiding from the desert sun is a bipedal hominid.  In this  instance, the animals are groups of refugees seeking sanctuary in a hostile  environment.  Quammen's account of Guatemalan refugees and their  mentors, also intelligent chimpanzees risk much to support and succor  them.  It's not a pleasant story, nor one any American can read without  remorse.  Quammen has made a sharp turn here from his usual  investigations of nature's secrets.  Refugee running is every bit as much a  secret as nature offers, but with what humans are pleased to call a &quot;moral  issue&quot;.  Quammen relates how well we've addressed that issue.refugees and their  mentors, also intelligent chimpanzees risk much to support and succor  them.

Do not take up this book while flopping into your favourite easy chair thinking you'll pass a  pleasant afternoon with a prize-winning author.  Gunter Grass has given us a prime example  of why awarding him the Nobel Prize was so appropriate.  Germany was the focal point of  Western history throughout the last ten decades.  This collection of observations might act as  a  text book for the period [although a supplemental reading list is recommended].  Grass'  superb presentation of the people living in each era is an ideal starting point for numerous  study topics.  An outstanding collection of how people felt and reacted to events, woven  tightly with their normal daily lives.<br />With narrators ranging from Kaiser Wilhelm II through working class ladies suffering the  effects of runaway inflation to miners striving for better conditions, Grass presents a spectrum  of Central European life.  His ability in capturing the attitudes of the narrators, whether male,  female, young, old, politically left, centre or right is elegant.  There are no flaws in any of the  portrayals.  He's unrestrained in having each character speak honestly, fluently and fully.  And those characters catch the flavour of each era in a faultless economy of words.  With such a mob as this, meeting and hearing them a few at a time is best.  You want to get to know them  well, and reflect on their words and views.<br />Central to any account of 20th Century Germany are two global conflicts.  Relating both  world wars through the eyes of novelists and journalists is a master stroke.  Only a writer of  Grass' ability could convey the outlooks of literary giants Remarque and Junger, and do it  through the mind of a modern woman.  A war correspondent attends a gathering of  journalists where in archetypal fashion, the old battles are re-fought, the old defeats analyzed,  the old friends lightly mourned.<br />History, however, is not made of wars.  It's ultimately the result of individuals making  decisions about their lives.  Grass' multi-faced account provides readers with deep insight  into why Germany is so important in the world scene.  He takes us into the minds of those  who struggled for workers' rights.  He shows us middle class men and women not quite  attuned to the loss of feudal tradition with the exile of the Kaiser, facing a collapsed economy.  American society, still trembling at the spectre of The Great Depression of the 1930s, never  experienced spending $2 500 for an apron, or using paper money to close cracks in wallpaper.  Nor was there a Western leader exhibiting the aura of redemption He exuded on becoming  Chancellor.  Even His opponents accepted the promised restoration of stability as a desired  end.  They couldn't forecast how it would be achieved.  Grass takes us through the minds of  those who clung to the promise until it was too late.<br />Grass' portrayal of modern times loses nothing in comparison to the more distant historical  view given earlier.  He's fully conversant with all the major issues arising at the end of the  century.  Americans who resent &quot;foreign interference&quot; in their affairs have tended to ignore  the protests against Viet Nam taking place in Germany in the 1960s.  The workers' unrest of  the 1920s is replaced by the broader social and political upheavals of the 1970s.  How many  countries can match the rise of Germany's Green Party to a position of national power?  Even  Dolly, the cloned Scottish ewe, scampers into our view; Grass delves deeply into questions  most of us  comprehend poorly.  Each vignette brings fresh surprises, delivered subtly but  goading our need to reflect on what they describe and why he offered it to us.<br />This book has more levels of value than we can address here.  Considering history is but a  surface element in this book.  Attitudes, their expression and derivation, is Grass' special  talent.  We need to read him for the conditions he lived through and presents for ourreflection.  Don't buy this book because Grass wrote it; don't buy it for its history of Germany  and the 20th Century.  Buy it to learn more about yourself.s for our  reflection.  Don't buy this book because Grass wrote it; don't buy it for its history of Germany  and the 20th Century.

There's more than a  little justice achieved by these tales.  Many of them, particularly this work, show how women  use their power of community to manage their lives successfully.  These stories need to be  told, and Kingsolver has given us a superlative example.  The community theme is superbly  demonstrated in Estevan's recital of heaven and hell - hell is peopled with those who cannot  reach out to others, starving in a kitchen full of food.<br />Lou Ann and &quot;Taylor&quot; are fellow Kentuckian exiles living in Tucson.  The relocation has  bought unexpected challenges to their lives.  Not the least of these is the additional burden of  infants: Lou Ann's by an unwanted pregnancy and Taylor's by an abandonment.  What does  it say about women that Taylor makes no attempt to off-load Turtle to a state agency, but  keeps her to raise.  Kingsolver evokes the reader's sympathy for both Taylor and Lou Ann,  although both are in situations of their own making.  Mattie, too, might have been given  greater role, particularly since she provides so many fundamental changes in Taylor's life.<br />Kingsolver's character development makes wonderful reading.  Occasionally, her descriptive  powers overcome her characterization and Taylor waxes rather more eloquent than her  background and education [which is almost entirely self-taught] would warrant.  It's easy to  forgive these lapses in light of how well she relates the story.  Throughout the book i  wondered why only Taylor speaks in the first person.  A dual viewpoint of characters and  events might have given this story more depth.<br />Estevan and his wife, Esperanza, are Guatemalan refugees.  Kingsolver's use of these  characters to point up America's support of the oppressive regime is depicted with skill.  Taylor's growing awareness of conditions there represents that of the average American -it's  visible only by direct confrontation.  Unfortunately, Taylor lives where sympathy for refugees  from oppressive regimes is minimal.  The place is called the United States, symbolized,  interestingly enough, by a woman standing in a harbour offering sanctuary to the oppressed.<br />There is a disturbing element in this and similar stories by and of today's women.  Men here  are universally portrayed without a redeeming feature.  There are no &quot;neutral&quot; males who  provide any form of support or reinforcement.  Angel Ruiz could just as easily have lost more  than a leg in his rodeo accident.  Instead, he must be portrayed as a deserting husband.  Kingsolver, however, has him appearing in cameos which only reinforce his role as the  uncaring male.  We are returned here to the early days of feminism in declaring males  superfluous to the community of women.  It's not a healthy indication for the future.  If the  atmosphere of &quot;us versus them&quot; intensifies, there will be greater backlash than is currently the  case.  If men have truly failed women over all these millennia, then it's reconciliation that's  required, not intensifying of resentments.  That only builds mutually reinforcing resentment.y, Taylor lives where sympathy for refugees  from oppressive regimes is minimal.

Although the importance of The Selfish Gene still transcends it, Climbing Mount Improbable  has unique value.  Dawkins has an exceptional ability to explain the immense spectrum of  life's complexities.  He demonstrates that skill admirably here in a volume that's proven  timeless.  Having bought this book when first published, it was particularly delightful to pick  it up again and discover it's lost nothing since then.<br />He begins this collection of essays with a new label: the &quot;designoid&quot;.  Designoids are those  elements in life that seem designed; beyond the caprice of the apparent random natural  forces.  Dawkins quickly points out that evolution is not &quot;random&quot; nor are any of the complex  aspects of living things the result of a designer.  Dawkins uses the title of this review,  attributed to Henry Bennet-Clark, as the basis for the rest of the book.  Natural selection can,  and does, explain it all.<br />Using the theme of climbing a mountain, Dawkins shows the true path to the peak is by  means of gentle slopes, not attempting a great leap.  Too many people accept the steep  precipice of divine origins as the explanation of complex phenomena in life.  Dawkins  explains how gradual steps are required for life to manifest spider webs, wings, and the  Christian obstructionist's favourite, the eye.  Each of these wonders is examined critically  with the best scientific logic, explaining its development with clarity and wit.  He frequently  reminds us that such complex organs as the elephant's trunk have progressed through  numerous stages, each of which was successful within its own environment.  As  environments changed, the trunk responded with new adaptations.  Modern animals, such as  the tapir, elephant shrew, proboscis monkey or seals, all exhibit nasal trunks that likely  represent the stages the elephant's ancestors passed through to produce today's<br />Computer models have become a favourite analytical tool for tracking likely paths in  evolution.  Dawkins has written his own and applauds others' successful efforts.  The  computer has the capacity to accelerate the likely steps life has taken in producing  designoids.  He's careful to warn us that mathematical models don't duplicate life's processes,  but simply provide situations that could have happened under certain conditions.  Even with  that caution in mind, his relation of the study of possible evolutionary paths of the eye is one  of the most captivating accounts in biology.  It's not even his own work.  Two Swedish  researchers programmed the most pessimistic conditions for the evolution of a workable eye  and deduced it would take less than half a million years.<br />The essay &quot;A Garden Enclosed&quot; might have brought a tear to the eye of E.O. Wilson, biology's  greatest exponent of biodiversity.  Dawkins takes us through the life cycles of the figs and  their wasp pollinators.  The beauty of this essay is almost staggering both in his superb  presentation and in the implications it raises.  Wasps inhabit the interior of figs, drawing on  them for nourishment and residence, but pollinating them with almost human dedication.  Dawkins' description of the complex interaction between plant and insect raises again the  issue of how little we know about life's interactions.  And how much we're intruding on them  in our ignorance.<br />Dawkins has never hidden his advocacy role in describing how evolution works and how  poorly our culture understands what's going on around us.  More than simply anticipating  obstructionists such as Michael Behe in Darwin's Black Box, Dawkins aims his criticism at all  who adhere to the Judeo-Christian assertion that humanity has some divine mandate to  exercise &quot;dominion over the earth&quot;.  Clearly, that belief will be the undoing of the species and  perhaps life itself if it isn't shed and a better understanding of the interaction of life attained.  The best place to start attaining that understanding starts with this book.

Darwin's idea of evolution by natural selection remains  under fire from those determined to find a ghost responsible for human  beings and the rest of life.  Dawkins answers the obstructionists with clear  logic and good science.  He directly addresses the big compound question  of who we are and whence we came.  It's a daunting task, not only because  of the tenacity of resistance to the answer.  Dawkins asks readers to open  their minds to envision vast stretches of time and conceive of the collection  of minute changes that must have occurred to arrive here from such  remote beginnings.  His writing ability gently leads readers along the  many steps necessary to come to an understanding of how life works.<br />His choice of Paley's 1802 publication &quot;Natural Theology&quot; to outline the  roots of obstructionist attitudes is excellent.  Although he wasn't  challenging Darwin [who wasn't born yet!], Paley's logic and arguments  are still used by those who resist being toppled from their divine pedestal.  Dawkins begins his presentation by explaining &quot;the watchmaker&quot; is  nature's blind forces of physics acting in an environment that could give  rise to life.  He spends time addressing the issue of complexity, its meaning  and its application to the forces of life in contrast to inert matter such as  rock.<br />Dawkins follows this analysis with examples of &quot;design&quot; [or lack of it] in  nature compared with design by humans.  From bats through bears to  Boeings, Dawkins lucidly explains the differences between nature's  &quot;decisions&quot; and those of engineers.  Evolution, no matter how illogical it  seems to the human witness, doesn't foresee the result of changes.  Our  brief existence demands answers within our lifetimes.  Dawkins posits that  we need patience, that nature works too slowly [with some exceptions - see  Jonathan Weiner's The Beak of the Finch for an update] to provide quick,  simple answers to how life works.<br />His chapter Accumulating Small Change addresses the issue of change in a  novel fashion.  It also counters the frequently raised challenge that  &quot;statistically, life can't evolve through random change&quot;.  Here, Dawkins  introduces a computer program which takes us through the evolutionary  process in accelerated steps.  He shows that while life is constantly  changing, these changes occur within certain constraints.  &quot;Randomness&quot; is  hemmed in by such limits as  weather, antecedents and valid physical  structure.  Giant pterodactyls and miniature bats appear vastly different to  us, but their fundamental structures are nearly identical.  Evolution, then,  relies on tiny steps of cumulative selection.  Little changes tested in life's  cauldron.  The survivors ultimately become polar bears, flatworms,  kangaroos, us.<br />After a wonderful chapter, &quot;Puncturing punctuationism&quot; demolishing  Stephen Gould's  iconoclastic attempt to erode Darwin's thesis, Dawkins  moves on to examine other, competitive ideas of how evolution operates.  Since many of the ideas discussed in &quot;Doomed Rivals&quot; have been utilized  by the obstructionists attempting to counter Darwin, this conclusion is one  of the most valuable sections of the book.  Starting with the premise that  no-one conscious of life can deny evolution, he goes on to examine how  various thinkers have addressed its mechanism.  Lamarck, who  understood life changed through time, still inspires adherents.  It's an  easier system to understand than Darwin's natural selection.  Its premise  of acquired characteristics remains wrong, however, no matter what new  versions of the idea are forwarded.  Dawkins carefully examines the  ancient and modern proposals on acquired characteristics, respectfully  disposing of them as good common sense, but bad science.<br />This book is vital to those wishing to developa feeling for understanding  our place in the universe.  Our society is so imbued with the concept of  divine origins that we've found it too easy to override the life around us.  Dawkins book realigns humanity with the rest of life on this planet.  If we  read and understand him, perhaps we'll regain the respect for our  surroundings we lost when we first conceived of gods.  If we aren't the  result of a spirit's whim, then perhaps we can address the future more  realistically.

Le Carre begins his examination of the modern form of imperialism in Kenya with the  murder of the wife of Woodward's colleague, Justin Quayle.  Woodward has reason to know  Tessa's murder may not be a random killing.  His definition of ethics places him among those  once called &quot;the Silent Majority&quot;.  A civil servant on the rise, he reflects how ethical values  have been eroded by surging &quot;globalization&quot;.  The erosion results from a rising tide of a new  imperialism - the multi-national corporation.  There are billions of dollars to be made in  developing new drugs and ethics aren't profitable.  When government policy furthers the  process, people like Woodward are there to help it along.  How Le Carre's people deal with  ethics is the central focus of this book.<br />The George Smiley trilogy gave us a lexicon of &quot;spy industry&quot; jargon.  This book introduces  &quot;pharma&quot; as a new buzzword.  It identifies a new subversive adversary - the international  pharmaceutical corporation.  It's a term that is likely to be with us for some time.  In the way  that his spy novels kept us focused on the Soviets as cruel foes, the pharmas are depicted as  influential, determined powers existing  nearly uncontrolled.  Unlike the image carried by the  Soviet antagonists, the pharmas' image is ameliorated by the demand for their products.  Everyone wants what they can provide.  What cost are we prepared to pay in their bringing it  to us?  Le Carre bluntly confronts us with that question.  Le Carre shows vividly how the  response is clearly individual.  No agency will front for us in dealing with the pharmas.<br />A departure from his spy novels, this book is hard to categorize.  That's good, since it shows  Le Carre has breadth and remains capable of surprise.  He's on a campaign here, and wants  us to join it.  He shows the venality of government agencies under thrall to outside forces and  depicts the people representing those elements with skill.  Woodward is particularly well  portrayed, as is Curtiss, the pharma baron.  Justin Quayle is more difficult to diagnose.  For a  Foreign Office functionary, his ability to &quot;go to earth&quot; seems rather elevated, but Le Carre  needs this to give us all the information we require.  Only Le Carre could give a persona to  someone dead, displaying it without providing a living voice at any point.  Tessa speaks  through Justin Quayle's memories and interpretation of events.  It seems clear that the  characters take a back seat to the message of the book.<br />Justification for the conclusion of this tale seems lacking.  It's almost as if Le Carre had tired  of writing and had to contrive an ending, no matter how illogical.  There's no motivation  given for the pilgrimage, especially with prior events related in the story.  The scene is very  nearly a reprise of Leamas at the Berlin Wall in Spy Who Came In From The Cold.  There is  the same sense of philosophical failure and bleak future.  Clearly, this book will not launch a  trilogy in the vein of Smiley's quest.  Which is sad, since globalization is a force sweeping the  world in ways that would have made Lenin cry out with envy.  Le Carre shows how the  morality of communism and corporatism stand at par, toppling governments, repressing  dissent and manipulating lives.  Once again, Le Carre has exposed a world hidden from most  of us.  He's exposed it with his usual skill at language and characterization.

Clearly, this book will not launch a  trilogy in the vein of Smiley's quest.  Which is sad, since globalization is a force sweeping the  world in ways that would have made Lenin cry out with envy.  Le Carre shows how the  morality of communism and corporatism stand at par, toppling governments, repressing  dissent and manipulating lives.  Once again, Le Carre has exposed a world hidden from most  of us.  He's exposed it with his usual skill at language and characterization.  It's a book to be  ignored at your peril.	2001-02-03

His string of  works, both poetry and fiction,  provide the reader with endless opportunities to view life  from many sides.  He has, as this book shows, a particular talent for presenting the world  through children's eyes.<br />Dream Stuff is a collection of short stories mainly centred on how children perceive  themselves.  There are reviewers who claim Malouf paints a &quot;dark&quot; world.  This is a false  assessment.  A child's outlook has to contend with a variety of needs, often conflicting ones.  They have the desire to explore, to escape parental restraint, yet bear an underlying need for  security and stability.  Malouf is able to convey these contrary aims in subdued, but effective  portrayals.<br />The stories in this collection point up those conflicts in carefully measured prose.  Throughout  these accounts of childhood, memories form a framework.  A young man coming to grips  with the fact that his missing father is unlikely to return.  A religious clan in a midst of a  family crisis.  A cycle of life from earliest recollections that return to create a reprise of visions  spurred by a bizarre assault and its resolution.<br />As others have indicated, it's the final tale in this set that stands out as a jewel among the  collection.  In this &quot;Great Day&quot; of Audrey Tyler's seventy-second birthday, Malouf  demonstrates his matchless skill at presenting his characters.  Moving lightly among them  with accomplished dexterity, he conveys their persona with a admirable economy of words.  Within but a few pages we are given the family history, the depth of feelings and various  levels of personal interaction any writer must envy.  The old man is the pivot of their  existence, a circumstance they all ultimately realize, each in their own fashion.<br />It's amazing to read reviews of this work continually pointing out his Australian roots.  None  of these stories is fixed in place.  Nothing in these stories condemns them to a particular  national framework.  It isn't necessary to know Australian conditions to absorb what these  tales convey.  They are timeless and represent environments any  reader here might  experience.  His view of life is far too wide-ranging to try to limit him in a national  framework.  Malouf has an unmatched ability to transcend age, gender, space and time  frames in presenting these narratives.  His talent should be recognized for that skill.  That  ability is quite sufficient for any reader to enjoy this book.his work continually pointing out his Australian roots.  None  of these stories is fixed in place.

Nearly every element  is here, delivered with Pratchett's finest prose and wit.  This a bit of a wonder, as it's a murder  mystery, a genre I rarely delve into.  Still, it's a Pratchett and goes from being worth a look to  something to be cherished, its chief character a man to be admired.<br /> Sam Vimes, who we first encountered in a sodden gutter, soddin' drunk, has risen to a  knight's rank and is now Commander of the City Watch.  He maintains a careful balance  between being the Patrician's favourite and his nemesis.  Vetanari knows he cannot truly  control Vimes, yet for all Sam's resistance to the Patrician's deviousness, knows too that he  cannot dispense with The Stoneface Policeman.  Especially this time when its Vetanari  himself who is the victim of a murder plot.  An unsuccessful one, as it happens.<br />Sam's entered the realm of matrimony, a step which elevates him almost more than the<br />promotions the Patrician has granted.  Lady Sybil, however, remains at the periphery of  Sam's focus.  He's still a copper and one of the biggest cases of all confronts him in this book.  First, foremost and throughout this book, Sam Vimes is tasked with guarding his own back.  Vimes is &quot;a jumped-up copper to the nobs, and a nob to the rest&quot;, which gorges the ranks of  his enemies.  His thwarting of an Assassin is pure Pratchett; pure Vimes, for that matter.  One  can't help but wonder why Vetanari doesn't assign Vimes some bodyguards.  Instead he gets  a sedan chair - which he &quot;drives&quot; himself.<br />There are murders in this book, unusual in Pratchett.  Two deaths arouse the City's ire against  new Pratchett figures, the golems.  Golems reach far into the depths of European history -  mindless, man-like creatures from the soil who can be put to any task.  Created only to obey,  they are the perfect slave - rebellion isn't in their make-up.  Except for their size, they are  nearly defenseless.  The perfect suspect, ultimately vulnerable, who can be destroyed without  qualms of conscience.  The situation is so clear-cut that Sam knows they can't be guilty.  But  who is?<br />In his quest for justice, Sam is supported both in the plot and in the characters of his Watch  team.  In this book, Angua reaches new levels of prominence, which brings Carrot forth in  new ways, as well.  Describing their situation as a &quot;relationship&quot; gives the term a whole new  meaning.  The Watch now has a forensic expert in the figure of a dwarf - Cheery Littlebottom.  It's not possible to dwell further here on this unique Watch specialist.  You must read this  book to become acquainted with one of Pratchett's most engaging characters.  Read further to  discover one of his most devious creations.<br />As with most of Pratchett's recent books, there's a sub-theme running beneath all the hilarity  and convoluted thinking.  In this case, the issue is &quot;freedom&quot;.  This word has been bandied  about by so many writers in so many circumstances, it's hard to believe that Pratchett could  bring anything fresh to the discussion.  As always, Pratchett is able to surprise and excel.  His  discussion freedom's worth and what it takes to be achieved adds lustre to an already superb  story.  Pratchett's ability to bring philosophical issues into what is still described as  &quot;humorous fantasy&quot; is a unique talent.

As these pages attest, there are a number of fine writers out there providing us non-scientists  with insights on nature's mysteries.  None, however, quite reached the breadth of view or  intensity of feeling imparted by Carl Sagan.  His writings explained topics ranging from  quantum particles to the extent of the cosmos. Along the way, he addressed evolution, space  engineering and countless other facets of science and technology.  Even fiction wasn't beyond  his grasp.<br />Pale Blue Dot is a journey in time and space.  Beginning with the assertion that we're natural wanderers, being the only species to settle across our world, it continues with a plea to extend further our exploration of  space.  The early chapters challenge restrictions on our desire to explore and learn.  Sagan  demonstrates how foolish minds have restrained our quest for knowledge of the cosmos.  He  then takes us on a tour of the solar system, exhibiting the wonders revealed by the fleet of  robot probes.  He reminds us of the forces the cosmos can unleash, sometimes right in our  neighbourhood.  Like many of the rest of us, Sagan was awed by the collision of a comet with  the Jovian gas giant.  It was a hint of what might lay in store for us if we fail to understand  the universe better than we do now.  The space probes also returned images of worlds  invalidating existing theories of planetary formation.  If our own neighbours can present such  bizarre structures, what kinds of worlds ride beyond our ken, circling suns we can barely  imagine?  What Sagan can't portray, he can conjecture.  With his firm working scientist's  foundation, Sagan's speculations command respectful attention.<br />This book must be shelved alongside Richard Dawkins THE SELFISH GENE and THE  BLIND WATCHMAKER.  Together, these three fine works confront the traditional Western  view of a universe and the life in it resulting from a Designer.  From Dawkins' biological  analysis to Sagan's cosmological view, this obstructionist outlook is here rendered  groundless.  More people must read Pale Blue Dot to gain an idea of who we are and where  we stand in the vastness of a nearly limitless universe.  Please read this book and convey its  ideas to others.  There is much to be gained from its imparted wisdom.structionist outlook is here rendered  groundless.

Visiting every home with children, he leaves gifts for the kiddies in stockings hung on the mantle or under the Hogswatch tree.  There usually is a snack on the table for him: a glass of \\"sherre\\" and some pork fries, with turnips for the hogs.  The sleigh, you see, is drawn by four immense boars, not reindeer led by one with an inflamed nose.  This year, however, the Hogfather has disappeared and a substitute has taken his role.<br /><br />\\"The Discworld is a world, and a mirror of worlds\\".  The world it reflects is ours.  Many literary commentators disparage fantasy as \\"escapist\\", suitable only for the young or others dodging reality.  Pratchett, on the other hand, smacks you in the gob with reality.  Yet he manages do achieve this with a level of wit and learning no other fantasy writer can hope to emulate.  There is some magic on Discworld, but Pratchett's talent lies in characterisation, not make-believe.  Most of his figures are human, but humans create characters in their own minds.  On Discworld, these are manifested as \\"anthropomorphic personifications\\".  We are familiar with some: there is a God of Wine, for example.  Yet, for some reason, we don't have a God of Hangovers - an oversight in the logic of our mythology.  Where we have \\"Santa Claus\\", on Discworld the Hogfather is the \\"jolly elf\\" bringing happiness to children.<br /><br />Still, there is one personification we are loathe to consider - Death.  On Discworld, Death doesn't kill, but merely takes the life essence when Fate so decrees.  Death may spend a moment with the snuffing of a tube-worm at the ocean's depths, but his real interest is humans.  He doesn't understand them, although he strives to do so.  Circumstances led him to become a grandfather once - sort of a grandfather.  That little girl, Susan Sto Helit, also strives: to be a Normal Person in the Real World.  Grandfather's concern for humans, however, forces Susan to ease out of the Real World in a reluctant quest to learn why the Hogfather isn't doing his rounds.  And why her grandfather has assumed his role.<br /><br />On the Discworld, most businesses are combined into Guilds.  There's the Guild of Astrologers, Thieves' Guild and the ladies of The Guild of Seamstresses [\\"hem!  hem!\\"].  There is also an association of elite gentlemen, The Assassins' Guild, which \\"inhumes\\" victims for clients for a fee.  Lord Downey, Head of the Assassins has been approached by a \\"client\\" offering a large fee to inhume the Hogfather.  He passes the task to Mister Teatime [pronounced Teh-ah tim-eh - \\"Nobody gets it right, Sir\\", he mourns.] who has already considered the problem \\"on my own time, Sir!\\", he insists.  For Mister Teatime has indeed seen the benefits of \\"bringing the Hogfather to an end\\".  It involves kidnapping the Tooth Fairy and how to control the minds of children.<br /><br />Death, who has a vested interest in children because they will become adults he can study, has an assistant.  Albert Malich was a wizard the Unseen University, where young wizards trained.  As a human, Albert acts as a resource in Death's pursuit of understanding humans.  Humans are too illogical, too individual, too unpredictable for reasoned analysis.  Death  doesn't wish to change them, but he yearns to understand them.  Others in the universe, particularly the Auditors, find human behaviour irrational, but worse, chaotic.  Their aim is Order in the universe - and Mister Teatime is engaged in fulfilling that desire.  It's part of the contract.<br /><br />Pratchett's development of this story is one of his finest accomplishments.  The twentieth Discworld story - in a collection now exceeding three dozen, he has woven his characters into something grand and universal.  Although now over a decade old, the book retains wide  appeal for many reasons.  There is something here for everybody, including Pratchett's use of science in unexpected, but not inappropriate, places.  Pratchett's writing is captivating, not only because his command of language is peerless, but because he engages your attention in surprising and challenging ways.  In three dozen books, he has never repeated himself or let a major figure become boring.  Those that reappear in successive volumes grow and develop fresh attributes.  Not the least of those being Death himself.  Speaking, as he does in THE VOICE, he remains both entertaining and worthy of ungrudging respect, exhibiting very \\"human\\" qualities.  For all his supposed prowess, Death must manipulate a human to bring this book to its conclusion.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada].

Of all the shabby, unjustified aggressions witnessed during the 20th Century, few surpass the Malvinas War - Maggie Thatcher's effort to stand with Victoria Regina in Britain's regard.  Hundreds of lives were lost over a set of cold, desolate islands in the remote South Atlantic.  Someone has calculated that if the money spent on this last gasp of the British Empire had  instead gone to resettlement, every resident of the Falkland Islands could have received a  million dollars and a new home.  Jingo is among the greatest critiques on the folly of wars.  It  would be nice to think someone sat the Iron Lady down and read this book to her, but she probably wouldn't comprehend it.<br /><br />When an island rises from the sea on Discworld, the nearest \\"nations\\" immediately lay claim  to it.  The clash of claims leading to war is almost inevitable.  Pratchett explains how \\"war  feelings\\" must be fostered and encouraged, even when the cause of conflict is such a  departure from reason as this pitiful gob of land.  Sam Vimes, arguably the most reasonable  man on Discworld, becomes a victim of war propaganda, swept along in its tide against his  will.  Sam's natural leadership brings the rest of the Watch along.  Except for two who've  gone missing - conscripted by, of all people, Lord Vetanari.<br /><br />Pratchett's characterizations in this book achieve a new pinnacle, especially the new ones.  Ahmed, at once Sam's foil and his peer, is a wonderfully enigmatic creation.  That he's from  \\"the other side\\" merely adds to his value in this book.  It's to be hoped we meet him again in  some future book.  Leonard of Quirm arises from earlier vague references to become a real  person.  The near-stereotype of the absent-minded scientist must have set some teeth on edge  at Oxbridge, but Len is a portrayal everyone will recognize.  There's one new character,  however, that will give the most dedicated Pratchett fan some pause - Beti.  More than just a  fresh persona, Beti gives Pratchett an opportunity explore previously unrealized themes in  his writings.  Some comparisons might be made with Angua, but they would pale against  what Beti brings to Pratchett's recent publications.<br /><br />Only one of the characters in this book could be called a disappointment - Carrot.  It's almost  impossible to view Carrot as an overblown portrayal, but Pratchett manages it this time.  No  matter - there are too many other excellent renditions that keep you reading and enjoying.  Especially that of Sam Vimes.  Lord Vetanari's resolution to the strife is in the finest Pratchett  tradition of innovative conclusions.<br /><br />The sad aspect of this book is that it was written ten years too late - the  act of self- glorification had passed.  As a message for future leaders of any nation, it seems to have  missed the target.  In part, that's because the media and other reviewers of Pratchett's work  think that he's a humourist.  That's mistaken.  Pratchett's a philosopher who happens to have  the talent to make us smile while he's making us face real issues.  Pratchett forces us to  confront ourselves, our prejudices and biases leading us into conflict with our fellows.  The  theme of \\"us\\" and \\"them\\" seems as ancient as humanity.  Whether it will ever be shed is a  matter for conjecture, but this book, if read by enough, brings some hope.  Pratchett is always  more than \\"just funny\\" and this work is one of his finest treatises on human frailty.opportunity explore previously unrealized themes in  his writings.

While many books  are produced depicting that environment, the results are too often contrived stories, lacking  reality.  The true existence of such communities, on the other hand, is usually too mundane for  successful story telling.  Drama seems lacking; the people's lives seem too common for a  writer to tackle and present in a way to capture reader attention.  Unless the writer has  exceptional ability.<br />If you pick up The Macken Charm you will encounter such a writer.  You will meet a man  who's spent his life in such a place, yet who has the aptitude to convey how much drama  such lives can endure.  There's nothing false or contrived in the events surrounding Glory's  funeral or the times preceding it.  Hodgins has given us the lives of this remote community  through the eyes of the youthful Randy Macken.  Randy, torn in many directions over  relations with his family, the blood relatives and the married-in ones, coincidental with his  wish to escape the isolation in the nearest big city - Vancouver.  It's an old story, but Hodgins  deals with it in ways rarely achieved by today's urban writers.  His ability to see the family's  interactions through the eyes of this young, if discerning, man reveals the talent of this writer.<br />Although Hodgins' portrait of Randy Macken is valid and captivating, it's the presentation of  Randy's cousin Toby that shows Hodgins at his best.  A figure that could have been buried in  dramatic surrealism, Hodgins brings this tragi-comic figure to life in subtle steps.  Toby's  entry is sly, almost a backstage insertion into the day's events.  But he's a central figure in  Randy's life and in the minds of Barclays, Mackens, Aaltos and the rest.  To discover why,  pick up this book and spend a quiet day reading and reflecting on people you probably  know.  You will discover one of North America's finer authors, one whose books you will  seek out as treasures to be added to your shelves.easures to be added to your shelves.	2001-01-26

At the end of Interesting  Times, Rincewind found himself on a red-soiled beach, confronting four black-skinned blokes  who offered him a gift - a painted, strangely bent, stick.  Disgusted with such a tainted  offering, the failed wizard threw it away . . .<br />We never find out if the boomerang actually returns to bash our hero, but he's obviously in a  land novel to his experience.  The Four Ecks continent could be described as the world  upside-down.  Except that's impossible on the Discworld and hemisphere-centric on ours.  The trees shed their bark instead of their leaves and an amazing number of animals have  pockets.  The place is dry, dry, dry.  In fact, it's Rincewind's destiny to bring the current  drought to an end.  He's informed of this by a animal with a face like a rabbit, but with legs  that can disembowel you.  The kangaroo talks, but he's a hopping thesaurus of body  language.  Rincewind, of course, flees.  There are many places he can go, such as  Dijabringabeeralong.  The Last Continent &quot;isn't about Australia, it's just vaguely Australian.&quot;<br />Pratchett's knowledge of the model for Four Ecks is astonishing.  And he presents it to us in  wonderful prose and engaging wit.  Our first encounter with Rincewind is while he's seeking  a meal.  &quot;Grubbing for grub&quot; in &quot;the Bush&quot; can only mean one thing.  Rincewind's soliloquy  dances around the identity of a major Outback protein source without ever actually naming  it.  Later, Rincewind encounters the memory of Tinhead Ned, meets someone named Clancy  who's a wealth of Four Ecks homilies, and brews up a foodstuff unheard of in North America.  But any school child in the model for Four Ecks knows it intimately.  Vegemite is a staple  there.<br />While Rincewind is fleeing from a destiny not clearly understood, the Wizards have an  adventure of their own.  This lightly attached second plot book provides Pratchett with an  opportunity for more serious matters.  Having disrupted the flow of time, the Wizards find  themselves on an isolated island.  Strange events occur - the emergence of cigarette trees, an  inordinate number of beetles crawl and flit about.  The most bizarre of all is the toga'd figure  who appears and seems to be the cause of all these manifestations.  And well he might, he's a  god.  Unlike all other gods, he urges his followers to ask questions, to challenge whatever is  &quot;established&quot; and to see change as normal.  He uses the world's smallest screwdriver in  tinkering with his creations.  He's the god of evolution.<br />Pratchett's research in this area shows him at his best.  He knows that for millions of years  life on our world multiplied without sex.  When evolution produced sex, life on our planet  changed forever.  A recent spate of books on the evolution of sex shows how challenging the  can be, and Pratchett's hilarious presentation in this book could lead you to believe he's read  every one of them.  It's a superb effort of scholarship, delivered in a way that only PTerry can  shape.  It would be enlightening to wander into his study and view his reading collection.<br />Those who grizzle about this book are either unaware of the models he uses or are challenged  by the fact that Terry is not always &quot;just funny&quot;.  Many of his books relate the tale with some  deep, serious undertones.  Pratchett's one-liners are among literature's best.  His characters  are stunning outtakes on people we encounter daily, sometimes to our distress.  But he's a  wise, caring man who, as a clever writer, deals with a full range of issues.  That the Discworld  &quot;is a mirror of worlds&quot; should be taken seriously.  If you're looking in that mirror and don't  like what you see, you'd better look a little harder.  Perhaps something in the image needs  adjustment.vides Pratchett with an   opportunity for more serious matters.

This book is a collector's item in reviewing what is known about ants and calling  on students to consider how much remains to be studied.<br />The ants are one of the dominant forms of life on this planet.  They've spread to nearly every  environmental niche, adapting their habits and colony structure successfully.  Wilson and  Holldobler willingly convey their awe at this variety to anyone wishing to share it.  Among  the amazing accounts they relate, perhaps two stand out.  The finding of the earliest known  fossil specimens by a New Jersey family, and the night-foraging ants of Australia.  Holldobler  and Wilson's journeys have taken them to remote sites around the planet.  They have a fine  sense of how to bring the reader into their camps and excursions, sharing their discoveries  and their tribulations.<br />Along the way, we learn how ants form their colonies, breed, forage, make war and enslave  or absorb their fellows or other creatures.  &quot;Ants all look the same to the naked eye&quot; they state,  then show what a fallacy it is to continue believing that outlook.  Beginning as solitary  ground wasps, the ants have become one of the most complex social creatures in life.  Their  colonies range from simple bivouacs to huge structures.  They can remove tonnes of soil to  build a nest or range over extensive territories, terrifying even people with waves of  migrating insects.<br />Anyone seeking to understand even a little of the diversity of life should own this book.	2001-01-25

Steve Jones' innovative approach vividly demonstrates  how science has sustained the concept of evolution through natural selection.  He deserves our praise  for the effort he's put into assembling a wealth of resources, while presenting the information with  clarity and wit.  After, all compressing 150 years of steadily increasing information is no easy task.  And that information must be given the fullest possible exposure.  The reluctance of Christianity [the term `creationist' is meaningless distinction] to  understand natural selection is depressing, but even Steve Jones is unlikely to heal that blight.<br />Charles Darwin's THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES is the most important book ever written.  Not the best  known, of course, or most often read.  Yet no other publication has changed so many aspects of  human outlook.  Daniel Dennett rightly calls Darwin's idea `the universal acid'.  The concept of  change over time ranges over all science from quantum physics to cosmology.  Steve Jones'  modernization of ORIGIN is necessarily limited to the biological realm, but as he aptly demonstrates,  that's complicated enough.  Biology is a busy science these days, but Jones has brought us as up to  date as writing and publication schedules permit.  Addressing such a diversity of topics as AIDS,  where whales came from [they're not hairy fish!] and geological time scales, he's provided us with a  detailed scenario of evolution's course.<br />There are some interesting omissions in this book.  No listing of Mendel's paper in the bibliography  [although the synopsis of his work in the main text is valuable]; in fact, he doesn't mention that  Darwin had a copy of it in his library - unread.  Nor is there anything on island biogeography.  While  it would be unfitting to give Albert Russell Wallace more space in the text, there are several excellent  books on a subject ORIGIN was only touched lightly.  More significant is the lack of reference to the  Grant's work on Galapagos Finches [see Jonathan Weiner's THE BEAK OF THE FINCH].  If anyone  needs confirmation that evolution works, this three-decade long study will provide it.<br />None of the lacks are significant shortcomings in this effort to `update' ORIGIN.  Jones has presented  a stunning wealth of information, but put it together in a highly readable format.  He deserves the  widest possible readership for this book.  With luck, Jones will perform the same service with THE  DESCENT OF MAN.  There's little doubt it will be as valuable as this book.xcellent  books on a subject ORIGIN was only touched lightly.

The crusaders were largely  single-minded in their approach to the conflict, particularly in political matters.  The invasion of the  Soviet Union by Nazi Germany brought that Communist coalition into a rickety accord with the  Western Allies.  Loosely calling the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics &quot;Russia&quot;, the Allies lumped  many peoples together.  The member-states of the Soviet Union each had a sense of their own  nationalism.  In some cases, these client states gave uneasy welcome to the invaders in the belief they  would thereby shed the Russian yoke.<br />Thomas Keneally has added to our awareness of these conditions with A FAMILY MADNESS.  Many  survivors of Nazi Germany fled Europe at war's end.  So much attention has been given to those who  found sanctuary in South America, that we tend to forget there were other places to hide from justice.  Australia was a fine refuge for many European exiles in the post-war years.  But those &eacute;migr&eacute;s often  carried a heavy mental and emotional burden.<br />Rudi Kabbel, Sydney security firm owner, is one such, his father having been a police chief in Nazi- occupied Belorussia.  The weight of being the son of a man who assisted with the settlement of &quot;the  Jewish problem&quot; in his nation rests severely on him.  Belorussia, the Ukraine and other Soviet Union  members took the view that Jews were the foundation of the Bolshevik movement.  Russia, as the  driving force in expanding Communism and degrading national aspirations.  These nations had  engaged in pogroms against the Jews at earlier times in their history.  It was no novelty to continue it  under the Nazis as an element in their resistance to Russian hegemony.  So Stanislaw Kabbelski  willingly became an instrument against the hated enemy of Russian Communist Jewry.<br />Keneally's method of tracing this complex time is by the creation of a Kabbelski family history and a  diary of the elder Kabbelski.  The family now lives in Sydney, running the security agency.  Terry  Delaney, becomes involved with the Kabbels as an employee of the agency.  He complicates his  association by having an affair with Rudi's daughter Danielle.  As their situation evolves, Delaney  becomes increasingly aware of Rudi's disturbed mental state.  War criminal fugitives and their  families are falling under increasing scrutiny.  Rudi understands that &quot;history makes its claim -  history comes up and grabs people&quot;.  Now it is reaching up to seize him and his family.  And Terry  Delaney is being swept up in its grip.<br />With the blood of Irish rebels in his veins and as an ardent leader in the Australian Republican  Movement, Thomas Keneally is well versed it nationalist ideals.  He's expressed his ideals in fiction  and autobiography.  He knows how it can be expressed and what pitfalls may be encountered.  He  doesn't have to be Belorussian to understand the workings of the Kabbelski mind.  Nor does he fall  into the trap of his strong nationalist sense overlooking brutality done in its name.  Keneally's sense  of humanity is only excelled by his ability to relate a story with consummate skill.<br />Keneally's greatest talent lies in how his words can convey the thoughts of others.  Here, he's given  us a view of some of the hidden events of World War II.  We must be grateful to him for that effort.  In today's environment of numerous bushfire wars and &quot;incidents&quot; in the name of nationalist  aspirations, this book reminds us not to be caught by accepting simple answers to complex issues.

Weaving a compelling tale of finance, intrigue and history, he draws the reader into  the story with subtle proficiency.  This departure from his established run of 'spy' novels was  an inspired decision.  It's a shame this book isn't on the active inventory here.<br />The story recalls the recovery of hidden Nazi gold, art and documents by American soldiers  at the end of World War II in Europe.  Some of the soldiers seize the opportunity to filch some  of the treasure, setting up a Swiss bank.  The real prize, however, resides in the documents -  they possess a secret from the early days of the war.  The pivotal point of the story, the secret  is sought by many, each with their own focus.  It's a compelling idea, given impetus by the  'discovery' of a set of 'Hitler's Journals' a few years ago.  The bogus Journals don't detract  from Deighton's quite credible suggestion hidden in the documents' pages.<br />Without taking anything away from the plot, it is Deighton's characters that remain his strong  point.  In this book he conveys unalloyed identity to a diverse cast of participants from the  US, Germany, the UK and Russia.  None of them fails to convince the reader of their  authenticity.  You come to know them intimately, even the unpleasant ones.  Strangely, the  weakest character is the British Intelligence agent, Boyd Stuart.  Remoulding Bernard Samson  into Stuart would have been transparent, leaving Stuart slightly inconsistent.  The real star of  Deighton's cast in this book is Charlie Stein.  Deighton displays his finest talent in painting  this American war veteran in perfect colours.  Tom Clancy couldn't have bettered Deighton's  depiction of this sergeant running an Army Company with absolute confidence.  Officers are  merely decorative and built into the organization by default.  The sergeants are the real  managers, and Stein typically carries the ability through to today.  Not having had a brain  transplant from an American, Deighton's descriptive presentation of all of the Americans is  more than just impressive.<br />Deighton's prodigious research underlying this book is clearly brought into view through his  adept writing skills.  You will learn much from this book, while enjoying the story he weaves.  Surprises abound, but nothing is out of place.  A fine addition to any collection of Deighton,  historical speculation, or just plain captivating reading.  Why wasn't this story put on film?ity through to today.

He describes it as a 'universal  acid', eroding the fabric of traditional habits.  Dennett recognizes how violent  those  threatened by new ideas can become.  Robert Sawyer has taken that thesis to a new,  wonderfully conceived, level in this book.  Those reviewers grizzling about this story  recapitulating the O.J. Simpson trial must have skipped over the hard parts.  Illegal Alien is a  much deeper presentation of the workings of reactionary minds.  We've all seen how vicious fanatic religious &quot;leaders&quot; can be when orthodoxy is challenged.  Sawyer has extended that concept to a cosmic scale.  And he's done a superb job of it.<br />While the bulk of this book is an excellent summary of a modern criminal trial, Sawyer's real success is the building of the alien personalities.  Unable to lie, they are adept at evasion and equivocation when they deem it necessary.  The aliens are not the uniform society usually found in speculative fiction.  Instead, they turn out to be as divided as ourselves.  That the  division is based on the discovery of evolution of their species is classic Sawyer.  He's to be  congratulated on his deft handling of an alien civilization undergoing the same stress as our  own in dealing with Darwin's Dangerous Idea.<br />Sawyer isn't just the best Canadian speculative fiction writer.  He is at the top of the genre.  Unlike so many of his fellows, the 'speculative' side of his writing is minimal.  We may have  to stretch our minds in reading him, but not because his ideas are too bizarre or his science  base faulty.  Sawyer's science in this book is rock solid.  The exchange over evolution's  producing the eye was a prime example of his research abilities.  Richard Dawkins [Climbing  Mount Improbable] must be proud of his 'colonial' advocate.  Sawyer merges science and  fiction with sublime finesse.	2001-01-21

Although sold out on the first day of publication, it's safe to say that few readers, even highly educated ones, comprehended On the Origin of Species.  What of those lacking liberal  education or otherwise at least well imbued with a tradition of faith?  Huxley's barb brought about instant  clarity.  Science was uncovering secrets hitherto trapped in the earth.  One could either accept the information revealed by diligent labour in field and laboratory, or withdraw into the comfortable mythology of faith.  Put so simply the options sound an easy choice, but in that era [indeed, in this one as well!] abandoning faith had no match in bringing about an emotional wrench.<br />One man, vitally involved in the work leading to the clash at Oxford, was not at the debate.  He was far away in Pambula, New South Wales, running cattle.  Roger McDonald has chosen this most central of all possible people as a focal point in the debate between science and Christianity.  Syms Covington, the Beagle's sailor chosen to become Mr Darwin's Shooter, collected many of the specimens of birds and animals Darwin examined in developing his theory.  McDonald depicts him as a Congregationalist Christian, a sect viewed suspiciously in Victorian England, but one which encouraged education and learning.  This dichotomy allows McDonald to show Covington growing increasingly mindful of the importance of what he and Darwin are bringing into view.  Covington knows The Book Darwin is writing will bring it all together. Yet, even in Australia he continues to gather specimens for his 'gentleman' in England.  He's not fearful of learning, but his growing knowledge of life's variations and history brings  intensified fear and resentment.  His fright sometimes results in violence born of frustration.<br />McDonald has an exceptional, if subtle, talent for depicting a man's qualities.  His  books don't pander to the dictates of 'political correctness'.  As a historical figure, McDonald's Covington is a vivid example of a man's emotional and intellectual clashes of hopes, ambitions, fears, judgements  revealed in a clear, unexaggerated manner.  McDonald doesn't make  Covington a &quot;hero&quot;.  He knows how few heroes  there are and these rarely valid under close scrutiny.  McDonald's revelation of male feelings may be unpalatable to some.  Still, every bit as much as Darwin did, McDonald unveils a truth.  His books, in particular Mr Darwin's Shooter, should be read by anyone wishing to understand that truth.  This book is highly recommended for a variety of reasons, not least being the sheer ingenious idea of writing it at all.<br />As a side note, anyone interested can read Covington's journal as an electronic book in the Mitchell Library in New South Wales.  However, Amazon policy forbids my listing the URL, but any search engine will bring it up.fright sometimes results in violence born of frustration. <br />McDonald has an exceptional, if subtle, talent for depicting a man's qualities.

Bring Larks and Heroes is an item within a well established genre - Irish writers  conveying their intense feelings of who and where they are.  In this case, however, the  Irishman is a third generation Australian, the place is half-way around the planet and it's in  the founding years of the Port Jackson prison colony.<br />Keneally's Corporal Phelim Halloran represents nearly every aspect of Irish traditions.  He's  even been jailed for taking part in a subversive meeting before shipment to Australia.  He  wasn't shipped as a felon, however, but as part of the guard contingent.  Beset on all sides by  the harshness of British military governance and the Australian environment alike, he's  confronted with a succession of difficult choice s.  Ann Rush is a fellow Irish Catholic who  Halloran considers his &quot;wife&quot; even without the sanctity of a Church-mandated ceremony.  Keneally gives her a subtle power to influence Halloran's thinking.  She becomes a pivot point  of his considered options.  Confronted by a rebellion of Irish prisoners, who seem to be the  only ones capable of organizing one, Halloran studiously avoids taking any lives.  But a new  opportunity arises, one promising a new kind of freedom.  Halloran makes a choice; with  eternal consequences.<br />Is it stereotyping to say that an Irishman remains Irish no matter where the British or Nature  has driven or taken him?  Keneally's ancestry gracefully emerges through his words.  He is  able to convey the mixture of Celtic traditions, Roman Catholicism under Anglican rule, felon  and Marine interactions, brought together on the eastern shores of The Last Continent.  While  relating his tale of people embroiled in heart-rending events, Keneally remains able to convey  the uniquess of the Australian environment.  The morbid greyness of gum tree forests, sky  and sea in collusion to overwhelm the senses, the sterility of the coastal soils, all conspired to  bend the minds of the English exiles.<br />Keneally is Australia's bard.  In fact, he's the Bard of the English language.  His prose echoes the the beauty of the best bardic poetry.  He has no peers  as a storyteller, building characters from minimal sources.  He's done it with THE  PLAYMAKER, WOMAN OF THE INNER SEA, GOSSIP FROM THE FOREST and many  others.  Even his works dealing with more contemporary events present us with people we  come to know intimately by the end of the story.  Of all the historical fiction he's done only  THE PLAYMAKER displays his talents more fully than does BRING LARKS AND HEROES.  This book is truly a paean to his abilities and it's time and location mustn't deter you  sampling what he can accomplish.  He is a man of feeling, and without making his characters  into something artificial, he can impart those feelings through them.  If you haven't  experienced Keneally, this is a fine place to start.  There's a price, though.  Like me, you may  find you won't stop with this and your shelf will be filled with all his work you can find.senses, the sterility of the coastal soils, all conspired to  bend the minds of the English exiles.<br />Keneally is Australia's bard.

When a student  mentioned she'd heard authors should &quot;write what they know&quot;, Golding &quot;mounted his  transparent Nobel pedestal&quot; to thunder that he'd never been marooned on a desert island nor  constructed a cathedral.  Jack Hodgins may have listened to his relatives relate land clearing  on Vancouver Island.  He may even have blown a few tree stumps.  Certainly, he never  slogged through muddy trenches on the Western Front in France in 1916.  Good thing; we  might never have had the opportunity to relish his descriptions of the agonies of living  through and having to remember that conflict in later years.  For Hodgins is a master of  writing &quot;what he knows&quot; in combination with what he learns or conjures.  The result is an  engaging read, writing not to be missed.<br />Broken Ground's account of veteran resettlement in Canada strikes a touchy spot.  Seeing the  remnants of post-World War I rural allotments [don't grace them with the name 'farm'], along  country lanes in the US and Canada or in bleak isolation in Australian paddocks, induces the  conjuring of ghosts.  Cramped houses, wretched and sagging, roofless or home to hay bales  were once inhabited by families seeking a promised future.  These abandoned sites are vivid  testimony of how fragile that future  valid rewards given men who'd survived Western  Civilization's [sic] most horrendous conflict.  Hodgins gives us a fresh reminder of the impact  of that strife and the pitiable acknowledgment given its participants.  They had just spent  years combating enemies both human and natural, only to return home and learn struggling  to survive remained central to their lives.<br />Hodgins, who has a fine knack for portraying people, here expresses several voices in  depicting those post-Great War conditions in rural Vancouver Island.  The common thread of  those voices is Matt Pearson, veteran, farmer, teacher.  Hodgins' style makes it easy to  consider Pearson a projection of Hodgins himself, thrust back in time, living an imagined life.  Pearson isn't hardened by the war, although he's certainly toughened.  Disillusionment  assaults, but doesn't overwhelm him.  Pearson's role grows as the book wends its way to a  conclusion in modern times.  Throughout the book, Hodgins' portrayal of the survivors of  that era of unfulfilled promises reflects what he knows, yet hasn't lived.  It's a fine expression  of writing talent.  You needn't be either Canadian nor World War I veteran to enjoy what  Hodgins has produced.  Reading this book requires no more than to be sympathetic to human  values.Hodgins' style makes it easy to  consider Pearson a projection of Hodgins himself, thrust back in time, living an imagined life.

Someday, if the species actually survives, someone will write the definitive history of the  British Empire.  Such an chronicle must include voices of the peoples and cultures that  empire displaced or destroyed; how they saw these intruders and how they coped with the  intrusion.  Empire building, of course, stilled many of those voices forever, leaving to the  conquerors the option of ignoring the indigenous voices or attempting the reconstruction of  events as best they can.  The second option has been attempted in recent years through the  application of historical fiction.  Prime examples are Canada's Rudy Wiebe with A  DISCOVERY OF STRANGERS and Thomas Berger's LITTLE BIG MAN in the US.<br />Matthew Kneale has created a fresh picture of empire builders.  Empires  are not created by  royally appointed governors, but by the people who settle and survive.  In order to produce  this picture, Kneale has woven a tapestry of many threads.  The threads are the lives of many  people involved in the complex world of imperialist endeavour.  And please take note, these  threads are real people.  While the real-life model of Captain Kewley has escaped me, most of  the remainder surely lived.  Geoff Wilson may not have a specific model, but he clearly  represents the archetypal English cleric that was growing ever more terrified at what science  was disclosing in that era.  Kneale's use of Charles Lyell's books is inspired.  After all, the  voyage begins only two years before the publication of Darwin's THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.  Skinny Geoff might well have been modeled on &quot;Soapy Sam&quot; Wilberforce.  George Ausgustus  Robinson, a cleric of a different stripe, did struggle to prevent the continued slaughter of  Tasmanian Aborigines during Sir George Arthur's imposition of The Black Line to pen them  up.  Their life on Flinders Island was a slow descent into oblivion.<br />Kneale keeps the central voice of this story almost totally silent.  When &quot;Mary&quot; speaks, it is  through her son Peevay, two of the more honest threads in this dark tapestry of deceits and  conflicts.  Recently, Thomas Keneally, who should know as the author of THE CHANT OF  JIMMY BLACKSMITH, has spoken out against whites trying to convey Aborigine history by  saying &quot;it's time the Aborigines told their own story&quot;.  Tasmanian Aborigines are unable to  tell their story.  Their voices have been stilled forever.  Although Kneale credits Walyer as  &quot;Mother&quot;, she is also based on Truganini, the last full-blooded Tasmanian who died in 1875  and whose corpse did indeed suffer at the hands of Englishmen bent on reinforcing their  view that the British Empire was the finest of human accomplishments.  Kneale's portrayal of  Potter isn't that of an evil man.  It's typical of the attitude felt by all the British during this  period when &quot;the sun never set&quot; on their Empire.<br />When picking up this book don't be daunted by those who spent their energy counting the  characters or flipping back to the Manx glossary at the back.  The number of characters is far  transcended by what they think and have to say to you.  Listen to all their voices and learn.  It  matters not whether you know that &quot;jink&quot; is money, Kneale well knows how to convey  meaning without a glossary.  His characterizations are convincing and faultless.  There is  nothing artificial or contrived in any of them.

Kneale's portrayal of  Potter isn't that of an evil man.  It's typical of the attitude felt by all the British during this  period when &quot;the sun never set&quot; on their Empire.<br />When picking up this book don't be daunted by those who spent their energy counting the  characters or flipping back to the Manx glossary at the back.  The number of characters is far  transcended by what they think and have to say to you.  Listen to all their voices and learn.  It  matters not whether you know that &quot;jink&quot; is money, Kneale well knows how to convey  meaning without a glossary.  His characterizations are convincing and faultless.  There is  nothing artificial or contrived in any of them.  This book is a masterful writing achievement.	2001-01-20

In a time  when propaganda had learned to cudgel reason and &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; were  first truly introduced, weakened French and British armies were told they were victorious.  In  truth, it was a sea blockade with it's attendant hunger and fatigue that had ended the battles.  No matter, propaganda had done its job well.  The Western Allies had convinced themselves  that Germans were evil incarnate for starting the war and that the time for vengeance had  come.<br />Even before the rise of Hitler, the Germans felt they'd somehow been betrayed.  Unable to  face a victorious enemy they considered inferior, German aristocrats delved into their Civil  Service to find four men to face the wrathful victors to bring about a peace.  Thomas Keneally  has searched into the histories of these four, so poorly equipped to face such immense anger,  resurrecting them to become the central figures in a drama of foregone conclusions.<br />Thomas Keneally has an unmatched talent for bringing the &quot;small people&quot; into literary  prominence.  Given the list of his works, you'll seek in vain for depictions of the like of Henry  VIII, Elizabeth Tudor or the Sun King.  Keneally won't waste his talent or your time on such  artificial entities as hereditary monarchs or esteemed statesmen.  Yet all of his characters,  particularly in this book, are placed in positions of world-shaking importance.  Mighty events  hinge on the actions of these otherwise &quot;common characters&quot;.  More, he draws them with a  vividness any medieval bard would envy.  He has no axes to grind, but shows us how  important it is for us to understand that history doesn't move at the whim of those who  consider themselves important.  &quot;For want of a nail . . . &quot; is the key concept behind nearly all  of his writing.<br />If ever there was a man to envy, it's Tom Keneally.  He has an ability to get inside the minds  of his characters, presenting them to us with unchallenged validity that most writers cannot  equal.  But if you're not a writer trying to emulate this talent, you may pick up this book fully  confident that you have encountered a writer of special strengths.  There is no aspect of this  book that warrants criticism, with but one possible exception.  When this book was  recommended to a friend, she came back with the complaint that &quot;it isn't fair to write about  real people.  How would you feel if one of these people was your uncle?&quot;  Keneally's very  next book, A RIVER TOWN, was based on the life of his own grandfather.

Terry Pratchett's 'mirror of worlds' is staring us right in the face.  He wants us to take him  and ourselves more seriously.  Fantasy is on the decline on the Discworld, humour becoming  more cynical and real-life issues reaching out to claim our attention.  The origins of this trend  aren't easy to pinpoint.  Certainly all of the Sam Vimes series demonstrate it, with FEET OF  CLAY  and JINGO prominent in presenting us with the round world Discworld mirrors.  This  latest product of one of our world's more penetrating writers challenges us to look at  ourselves closely.  Which values do we truly subscribe to today?<br />Many who use Pratchett to escape from the realities of life will grizzle about this trend.  This  book is easily the least 'escapist' of any he's written.  We are given a dedicated newsman  who's challenged by business 'ethics'.  A tabloid competitor emerges,  offering readers glaring sensationalism, but false &quot;news&quot;.  Supplies of paper dry up, the press  is demolished and survival of both the Ankh-Morpork Times and its publisher comes into  question.  This book isn't fantasy, it's history.  It just happens to be Discworld's reflection of  Round world's chronicle of business ethics.  The only thing missing in this account is the  &quot;market survey&quot; to assess what will sell to the population.  Indeed, the most telling line in the  book is Vetanari's comment that &quot;people don't want news, they want olds&quot; - the confirmation  of what they already believe.  &quot;News&quot; will simply cause people to think, and we all know how  dangerous that is.<br />William de Worde's choice of &quot;newsboys&quot; an interesting touch.  Foul Ol' Ron, the Duckman,  and, in particular, Gaspode, purveying the A-M Times on the city's streets, would have been  a memorable sight, but Pratchett pushes them into the background.  Foul Ol' Ron as a  reporter might have led the Times down an interesting path.  The biggest news, however, is  an almost murder.  Vetanari is again placed in an unusual position for a City Manager, and  the twists of that tale are Pratchett at his finest.<br />One thing missing in this book is the progeny expected by Sam Vimes and Sibyl at the end of  FIFTH ELEPHANT.  It's too soon for that in the Discworld timeframe, of course.  Since Sam  appears in this book, the image of Ol' Stoneface as a parent would have been priceless.  Printing and spreading the news immediately called up anticpation of The Librarian making  an appearance, but we have to do with Foul Ol' Ron instead - not a bad trade, just a small  disappointment.  Foul Ol' Ron might have been puffed a bit.  After all, the only coherent  expression he's uttered 'Queen Mary says to watch your back, mister' might well have been  enlarged on here.  Leaving all communication to Gaspode, who has his own agenda to follow.<br />Long-term fans of Pratchett shouldn't be disappointed that the light-hearted days of  Rincewind and the Wyrd Sisters seem to be fading into the background.  We should be glad  he's still producing.  Years ago in the US, a similar voice in the person of Tom Lehrer used  humour to awaken Americans to some of their dearly-held follies.  The election of Ronald  Reagan drove Lehrer into retirement, a sad loss.  That Pratchett is able to keep reminding us  of who we are, and do it in such entertaining fashion, is a tribute to him and encouraging for  us.  He's telling us that he believes there's hope yet.murder.

What more is there to say about this innovative work from the Age of Nuclear Terror?  In  those times we were assured by our &quot;leaders&quot; that a &quot;balance of power&quot; was the way to keep  peace.  Those with an IQ greater than room temperature, however, well knew that one finger  on one button in one second could obliterate the world.  Many writers sought to wake  America to the threat they had created.  FAIL SAFE, DR STRANGELOVE, the list of works  explaining how the nuclear holocaust could occur expanded in this era.  Few writers  addressed &quot;the Day After&quot;.  CANTICLE was almost the first to picture the aftermath.  Harlan  Ellison's incisive analysis A BOY AND HIS DOG, honouring directly Miller's groundbreaking  work, essentially closed the genre.<br />This Miller's tale is a vivid examination of the workings of the American mind.  America in  the 1950's was a seething cauldron of anti-intellectualism, of distrust of the learned and the  innovative.  When CANTICLE was published, America was coming to the end of the  Eisenhower presidency, the eight years that &quot;showed America could do without a President&quot;.  Social programs, education, health care had all been pushed aside in favour of intense  military buildup and corporate expansion.  With a simple-minded ex-general in the White  House, the hovering threat of a &quot;flame deluge&quot; was at the forefront of most minds.  The  McCarthyite inquisition was the blatant expression of American fears.  Miller's rising new  governments exhibit a similar desire for mind control, with predictable results.<br />Miller's use of Mother Church as the sole organized survivor of the nuclear exchange was  inspired.  Catholicism was viewed with suspicion in America.  The debate over John  Kennedy's presidential candidacy the following year demonstrated the feelings the Church  engendered.  Yet, Miller got it exactly right.  No other institution in America would likely  have survived the Flame Deluge.  Neither government nor the military commanded the  talents nor ability to bring continuity to those who survived.  How ironic in the  fundamentalist America of CANTICLE that Miller could successfully raise this issue.<br />An even greater irony is the Beatification of Isaac Edward Leibowitz, descended of Polish  Jews, by an American Catholic monastery.  Jews were subjected to the same distrust from  America's Silent Majority as Roman Catholics.  One facet of that suspicion related to the  numbers of Jews in universities, technical programs and science.  Anti-Semitism and anti- intellectualism resided in the minds of many &quot;Middle Americans.&quot;  Leibowitz parades  through this story as mythical figure with a dual role - the founder of the Bookleggers and  representative intellectual, and  perhaps, in the symbolic Wandering Jew who reappears time  and again over the centuries after the Deluge.  Miller's handling of Leibowitz and the desert  hermit is without equal in the literature of the time or today.  The image of a admonitory  Prophet has nearly disappeared in today's writing, making CANTICLE valuable for its  timelessness.<br />More than simply fine writing and innovative thinking, CANTICLE has a message that  remains valid today.  The rendering of the Berlin Wall and the breakup of the Soviet Union  has not brought peace nor stability to the world.  Wars, especially religious wars, are  occurring with increasing, not diminishing frequency and intensity.  We have brushed with  enlarging one or more of those conflicts more than once.  Miller's warning message remains  valid and should be read by the new generation.  Remember, the source of the Flame Deluge  still resides in those Prairie silos and hidden Red Octobers, both Russian and American.  Read this book and find out what that might mean.luge.

You've got to read it!&quot;  It was, of course, Quammen.  That's the  kind of reaction this writer generates.  His prose seizes your attention as he gently leads you  into deserts, mountainous jungles, riverside woodlands and isolated islands in the Pacific.  His quiet courage forces you to remind yourself that he's not gleaning his information from  the vast list of sources in the back of this book, but from the researchers in the field.  And he's  right there with them as he relates their stories to him for you.  Quammen writes books you  want to carry around, waving at people, urging them to enjoy the superior writing and the  critical message.  It's all about our survival.<br />Quammen's resurrection of Alfred Russell Wallace was long overdue.  Others have tried to  bring this figure back into common knowledge, but the revival was either to accuse Darwin of  plagiarism or taint Wallace's accomplishments with the flaws of penury and spiritualism.  Quammen handles him as a total human being who achieved through inspiration in a  delirium, what Darwin took two decades to accomplish.  Quammen doesn't need to balance  the two, he's more concerned with explaining the concepts in ways we can understand.<br />It's Quammen's ability to make you feel you are accompanying him on his quest to see how  Nature that places him far above other science writers.  He understands the issues, recognizes  the value of the research being done and presents the methods and events alike with  unblemished clarity.  As a writer concerned with the impact of humanity on the world's  environment, Quammen exhibits a unique talent.  While the ongoing extinction of species  remains the central issue of this book, Quammen is able to show how dedicated researchers  given support from concerned and caring people can begin to slow that eradication of our  fellow species.  Quammen's concern doesn't translate into alarmist rhetoric.  He calls to us  softly but urgently:  &quot;There's work to be done.  There's people out there doing it.  Help them  how you can.  They're our symbol of hope.&quot;es.  Quammen's concern doesn't translate into alarmist rhetoric.  He calls to us  softly but urgently:  &quot;There's work to be done.

Recently, a poll on the most notable figure of the previous millennium placed Charles Darwin in fourth  place.  That's three short of the mark.  No concept has been as wide-reaching and influential  as the idea of evolution through natural selection.  And this book should follow right behind.  It is clearly the second most important book published.  Dennett's approach deals with  Darwin's idea in a philosophical and logical framework instead of a biological one.  He  declares it the 'universal acid'.  Indeed, how does one contain the such a revolutionary notion  of change over time?  It has affected every aspect of the cosmos from astrophysics to quantum  theory.  Dennett points up better than anyone that if we truly wish to know what we are in  the scheme of things, Darwin's idea is the place to start.<br />The point of this book is, of course, that Darwin's concept hasn't been universally accepted.  Even those who acknowledge evolution may still contest Darwin's mechanism of natural  selection through adaptation.  Dennett's analysis of iconoclast Stephen Gould's 'punctuated  equilibrium' is delightfully scathing, but precisely on the mark.  The role of the heretic is to  threaten orthodoxy, whether or not the orthodoxy is false.  Gould, after trying for a  generation to scupper orthodox Darwinism, is here demonstrated to have failed miserably.  His attacks, however, have frightened the orthodox without weakening the structure of  natural selection.  Dennett's superb critique of &quot;punctuated equilibrium&quot; isn't a call for blind  adherence to orthodoxy, but instead demonstrates the strengths of Darwin's analysis and  why Gould's iconoclasm is misleading.  Gould's response to Dennett's clear review of the reality of  Darwinism has been petulant stubbornness rather than sound scholarship.  That's a pity.<br />Dennett's prose is delightful.  His analysis is direct and pointed in arriving at his conclusions.  Taking you step by step through his presentations, it becomes unequivocally clear that his  conclusions are iron-clad.  Nothing is left hanging - you are brought to each point with a  clarity any writer would envy.  The book isn't brief, but as Mozart once responded to the  criticism that there were 'too many notes' in his opera, what would you take out?  Dennett  builds his case with confidence, using numerous sources to support his contentions.  Coupling a high degree of readability with an equally elevated scholarship is no mean feat,  but Dennett achieves it with apparent ease.  For contrast, try Michael Ruse's &quot;Understanding  Darwin&quot;, another philosophical view of the impact of Darwin's idea.<br />If there's a better book somewhere on the impact of the greatest concept in science, please  point it out.  Dennett's analysis shows how widely Darwin's idea of evolution through natural  selection has permeated through all the sciences and society.  The resistance to the concept  remains high in the United States, the only facet Dennett is unable to address.  He's not alone  in that, but with the rise of Richard Dawkins' thesis of the 'meme' perhaps we may soon have  an answer.tions, it becomes unequivocally clear that his  conclusions are iron-clad.

My son, bless him, dropped this gem into my Christmas stocking when it was first  published.  With no idea where he'd found it, this book was gleefully snapped up and read to  the last page.  It was my introduction to Jack Hodgins, who has produced some terrific  work; too little considered even in his native Canada.  Central Canadian urban-based critics  have foolishly panned him as a 'regional' author since he places most of his work on  Vancouver Island.  Strange you rarely hear such appellations applied to writers stuck in the  concrete canyons of New York.  Whatever 'regional' qualities Hodgins carries, he's certainly  broken that mould with this book.<br />With a background in wet, forested and sea-girt Vancouver Island,  Hodgins confronts the vast, sparse deserts of western New South Wales  and Queensland, Australia.  He brings to light some of the wonders of the  Australian language and culture.  He feels exposed as a stranger: &quot;Jacko,  there's a Canadian boofhead out there begging for trouble!&quot;.  After  discovering a pick-up truck is a &quot;ute&quot; and a &quot;bound&quot; roast has had the bone  removed, he even seeks to identify a row of trees.  Surely, there's an  Australian term for Weeping Willows.  &quot;Oh, those?  They're Weeping  Willows.&quot;  He goes crook.<br />Hodgins isn't a stranger to Australia.  He'd been there before, often enough to become  acquainted with the Australian literary scene.  This book is a dual tour: the physical one of  following the desert roads to Outback towns and villages is joined with the literary journey  introducing us to the fine array of Australian authors.  While the physical tour of the desert  depicted here is an education in environment, bizarre weather and unusual language styles, it  is the discussion of writers and writing that captures the attention.  Over Forty doesn't refer  to age, of course, but temperature - a typical desert condition.  While the Darling River  overflows to lock them in the town.  Water can travel a long way in Australia before settling  into the sand.  No matter, it gives Hodgins more time to tell us about writing and authors.  He has a book bag full of Australians, and an Itty Bitty Book Lite to illuminate their works.<br />The physical journey has a bigger purpose than mere tourism.  Hodgins' companion is Roger  McDonald.  North Americans will raise questioning eyebrows at the name, but any  Australian can tell you that after Thomas Keneally, McDonald is near the top of the literary  hierarchy in the Lucky Country.  Although his MR DARWIN'S SHOOTER brought him into  the North American scene, the purpose of this pilgrimage is the completion of a work never  seen here - SHEARERS' MOTEL.  McDonald spent a year as a shearers' cook in researching  for this book about Maori shearers.  It is one of the finest examination of a man and his values  ever put in print.  All we see of it here is a taste of who McDonald is and who the people are  he worked with in bringing the book about.  Hodgins does a fine job of portraying the people  and the writer who related their work to us.<br />Anyone who's read Hodgins will admire his descriptive powers and his ability to portray  characters.  Throughout this book we are given glimpses of the writer's methods of creativity.  We see how once a story is begun, it tends to run away with the writer, whose job suddenly  transforms from 'creator' to 'recorder'.  This isn't 'journalism' but the ability of a real writer to  put his experience and talents into to the written word.  The description of a speech by  William Golding on 'inventing' characters and plots is an outstanding episode.  Jack Hodgins  has never been a woman running away from her husband, but he shows us the beginnings of  such a tale and how it might develop.  I've been waiting to read that book, but it remains in  Hodgins' notebook.in the town.  Water can travel a long way in Australia before settling  into the sand.

For many years, English explorers in Australia were convinced the centre of the island  continent hid a vast ocean.  The dream of an easy, controlled passage from the settled south- east coast to Asian markets remained a fixation.  Charles Sturt is renowned in Australia for  lugging a huge whaleboat into the arid Centre without ever finding a place to float it.  John  Eyre glimpsed the elusive lake that bears his name - a body of water which can extended for  hundreds of kilometres or nearly disappear depending on far distant and erratic rainfall.  Australia can have an Inner Sea, but it's an ephemeral phenomenon, appearing with  devastating suddeness, then dribbling away into the desert sands.  When human  communities exist where that sea wants to form,  extensive damage to crops and homes may  result.<br />Thomas Keneally places the story of Kate Gaffney-Kosinski in this environment.  Her  children lost in a house fire, she flees Sydney for the land of the Inner Sea.  Her emotional  swag is laden with her Irish heritage and the vagaries of her faithless husband.  Heavier than  these, however, is the sense guilt borne of thinking herself responsible for the lost of little  Bernard and Siobhan.  She's not certain what the Centre will provide in the way of healing  power, but it's away from the scenes of so much grief.<br />Arriving at an Outback village, Kate resides in a pub, trying to bury her past.  But this town is  known as the Venice of Wrangle Shire.  Rains from the North brings water gathering in the  fields around the town.  Kate, who has taken up with Jelly, an explosives expert, is swept into  events nearly as helpless as those surrounding the loss of her children.  Her losses haven't  ended, however, and her strengths will continue to be tested even in this remote place.<br />Keneally uses two of Australia's most prominent animals, a kangaroo and an emu in the  keeping of Gus Schulberger.  This aspect of the book seems contrived at first.  Gus illustrates  a character scattered through Australian literature - the battler, a man [invariably] &quot;striving  against banks and weather&quot; in his efforts to gain security.  Accompanied by creatures of  almost divine status in Australia, Gus typifies the European insertion into that harsh,  extensive world.<br />It's for women to tell us how well Keneally has done in portraying their feelings and  responses in the circumstances Kate endures.  From a man's point of view, he's succeeded.  Kate's being subjected to various disturbing pressures are portrayed admirably.  He is a  master story teller and this book is no departure from his other successes.  What would the  world have lost if he had succeeded in pursuing his original ambition to enter the Catholic  priesthood in Sydney?  Fortunately, three dozen books later, he remains a major figure in the  literature of historical fiction.  Without peer in this realm, each of his books deserves space on  your shelves.  Many of them are eligible for repeat reading.

He is a  master story teller and this book is no departure from his other successes.  What would the  world have lost if he had succeeded in pursuing his original ambition to enter the Catholic  priesthood in Sydney?  Fortunately, three dozen books later, he remains a major figure in the  literature of historical fiction.  Without peer in this realm, each of his books deserves space on  your shelves.  Many of them are eligible for repeat reading.  Woman of the Inner Sea is one of  those.	2001-01-13

When this book finally reached North America, i urged my book discussion group to read it  as a quality example of Australian writing.  The reactions were nearly identical to those on  this page - Jacko is a creep and the ending seems to drop you unfulfilled.  Urging the group to  reconsider the options Jacko faces on the last page against the character he's presented up to  that point, the e-Mail over the next month became almost daily exchanges.  The discussion  group members realized how powerfully Keneally can depict people and what a superb story  teller this author is.  My discussion group was astounded to learn that nearly every character  in this book actually lived.<br />Jacko is the story of a son of Outback Oz having made the unlikely transplant to New York  City.  He's a major figure in New York television because he has a 'gimmick' - he literally  'crashes' people's homes first thing in the morning.  Like all major figures, people come to him  to solve their personal problems.  In this case, it's a missing daughter.  Jacko seizes on this  occurrence as both a means of enhancing his image and perform a act of moral value.  Jacko's  quest for  the girl and the demands of his own family's issues allow Keneally to take us from  New York to the Australian bush and finally to the Berlin Wall on that fateful night it was  reduced back to the level of Berlin streets.<br />Keneally's ability to portray persona is amply demonstrated in his depiction of Jacko, writer  Michael Bickham [anyone know who this really is?], Outback station owner Stammer Emptor,  film director Mark Torlucci and the others.  Perhaps Gunter is the only person in this  narrative without a specific life model.  The most poignant scene depicts the death of 'Barry  Larson'  who is based on a photographer Keneally worked with in producing a pictorial essay  about life in the Australian bush.  Chloe Emptor clearly achieves dominant status in this  book.  Only Australia, and its Northern Territory, could produce such a figure, and a writer  like Keneally to portray her.  Having read the autobiography of the woman Keneally bases  this figure on, she should be gratified at the depiction.<br />Too many American reviews of Keneally mark him as an &quot;Australian&quot; writer as if that  somehow limited his abilities or his work lacks some indispensable element.  Nothing could  be more misleading when assessing his work.  His stories are universal in both circumstances  and character development.  That he lives in Australia and often [but not always] sets some  or all of his tales in that environment shouldn't detract from the quality of his portrayal of  real lives and circumstances.<br />This book is too valuable to be relegated to the &quot;Out of Stock&quot; bin.  Its historical value is  surpassed only by the quality of Keneally's writing.  He has few, if any, peers in the business  of story-telling.  Jacko is a book i have no hesitation about pulling off the shelf and starting  again at page one.  He can hold the reader chained to story line, character development, or  portrayal of environment.

Portraying a man in an agony of  moral conflict over his love for a woman convict yet constantly aware of the family left  behind in England, The Playmaker addresses human feelings at many levels.  Like so many  of his books, Keneally has taken figures from history, weaving a plausible tale of the life they  might have led.  His examination of the mind and heart of Lieutenant Ralph Clark, during the  early years of the Port Jackson [Sydney] prison colony, a is deeply moving account.  Far from  home, these exiled people face disturbing choices.  Keneally compares the founders of the  Sydney colony with space travellers, isolated in a dangerous situation with limited resources.<br />Clark's task is the staging of a play in celebration of the king's birthday.  Assembling a cast  from the convicts, he's confronted with a range of personalities from house maids to forgers.  Keneally's research has dredged up backgrounds of these transported felons; the thieves'  guild oath is a particularly fine touch.  His real talent, however, is in presenting this material  through his characters .  Each of his figures projects a reality surpassing other writers of  historical fiction.  While his descriptive narrative may make modern allusions, none of his  persona are dragged out of their original time frame.  Ralph Clark is particularly well drawn.  Keneally has a special talent for presenting us with an 18th Century man's feelings and  aspirations as much as it's possible for us to know them.<br />That this book has been returned to the active sales list is a testament to its value.  It should be read by more people.  The 18th  Century setting is less important than what Keneally has to say about people.  Add this book  to your shelves with confidence.  It's worth more than a single read.	2001-01-08

Earlier  demands for 'equality' have been replaced by the 'FemiNazis' approach of judging and  condemning men who are denied a defensive voice.  Historically, male writers may have  overlooked or patronized women, but rarely presented them as arch-villains.  Kingsolver  assembles four daughters and a wife as Star Chamber prosecutors sitting in judgment of man  selling Jesus in the Congolese jungle.  Dragged from Eisenhower's America to an African  village, the wife and girls heap scorn on Nathan Price for his failure to comprehend the new  setting while they deftly learn to cope.  Closing the last page brought disappointment at not  learning the motivation for Price's bizarre behaviour.  What torments drove him to such a  narrow outlook and single-mindedness?  The sliver of evidence about Bataan was grossly  inadequate.  It's tempting to contend Kingsolver can't grasp a male viewpoint.<br />Fortunately, this book has too many redeeming features to condemn it for feminist bias alone.  Kingsolver's descriptive powers are a seductive force.  They lead the reader from the narrow  personal issues expressed Orleanna and her daughters to the weltanschauung of America's  imperialism.  From the abrupt culture clash opening the story, Kingsolver goes on to grant  Orleanna and her four daughters an increasing sense of African realities.  Their growing  awareness raises the stress between Nathan and his brood.  He cannot perceive what they  learn - Nathan's dogmatism has no place on this stage.  They find ways to circumvent his  rigidity, even his favourite draws away from him over a question of survival.  Finally, the  loss of one of them triggers the diaspora of the rest.  Nathan is abandoned to continue his  failed mission.<br />The real missionary here isn't Nathan Price, however.  It's Barbara Kingsolver.  Using the  Price family to portray the spectrum of American views of other cultures, she strives to  educate Americans about the follies of their own self-righteousness.  Aware that the phrase  'globalization' is but flimsy camouflage for &quot;Americanization&quot;, Kingsolver fathoms the  resentment of the Kilangan villagers toward Nathan as a small symptom.  It is an example of  the growing enmity of the remainder of the world to Americans imposing on other cultures.  Kingsolver uses the later lives of the daughters as an observation platform to make today's  generation of Americans aware of the legacy of missionarying geopolitics.  Nathan comes to a  fiery end.  Will Americans come to understand why their ships and embassies are bombed?  These are but sparks heralding a greater conflagration to come.  Given the overwhelming  power America exercises, there will be no trial weighing its transgressions.  But there will be  judgments.<br />Self-righteousness clouds vision and judgment; Kingsolver's effort, beautifully crafted as it is,  may be lost on those who most need to perceive it.  If the general tone of the reviews here is  representative, her powers of description may have overwhelmed the message.  Pity, it's a  message that needs to be heard clearly.  Recent political events suggest too few are listening.s, she strives to  educate Americans about the follies of their own self-righteousness.

Either found in the text or the  Bibliography, the name of John Maynard Smith stands ubiquitous.  There's a good reason for  such respect - Maynard Smith is both a capable scientist and strong presenter of science.  This  book, brief as it is, stands out as a prime example of his skilled writing hand.  His  collaborator, Eors Szathmary an Hungarian chemist, has clearly provided a wealth of  resource information on many aspects of how life's mechanisms determined the path of  evolution of early life.  This is their second association, and it's a splendid result of the merger  of two disciplines.<br />This work, like their previous book, puts to rest the idea that evolution by natural selection is  a 'group' or species phenomenon.  Evolution works at individual levels.  An animal, cell or  even a gene - how it operates, survives and replicates.  For all these elements to function  successfully and pass their behaviours on to succeeding generations, a wealth of mechanisms  must occur without serious hitch.  Maynard Smith and Szathmary take us through these  biological steps with unsurpassed clarity.  Yet with all this wealth of detail, the reader finds  nothing obscure or confusing in their descriptions.<br />This book starts with descriptions of attempts to understand how life started.  Now that it is  understand that life's history is but a bit less than the existence of our planet, the beginnings  of life must be a chemical phenomenon.  Maynard Smith and Szathmary show how these  reactions occurred and how they originated the steps leading to the complex life forms  sharing the globe with us today.  If their text wasn't clear enough [and it definitely is that] the  accompanying line drawings spell out graphically how chemistry drove, and is driving, life's  forces.  Those seeking a wealth of information on various species will be disappointed.  What  this pair superbly depict are the mechanisms uniform over all life.<br />Discussions of evolution cannot avoid addressing that creature who considers all life to have  been created to ultimately produce it - the human being.  The pair depart from their basic  concept here by addressing human society.  And rightly so.  The ability of humans to modify  their environment utilize powers that overcome the chemical basis by which we live.  This  ability rests on the use of language to convey ideas.  No other animal possesses this capacity  and the authors conclude this work with some ideas about the future course of human  evolution and the role language will play in it.  The major factor will be Dawkins' idea of the  meme.  They see memes as a Lamarckian element in human culture, guiding the path of our  ongoing development.  Clearly, a required companion volume to this book is Susan  Blackmore's THE MEME MACHINE.<br />This is a superb summation of evolution's workings and a must read for anyone wishing a  start in the mechanics of life.

She is, after all, a trained psychologist.  Like any guild with deeply held traditions, resistance to the novel concept of the meme and its power is already strong.  In itself, that's recommendation enough to read this book.  Fortunately, building carefully on the foundation laid down by Richard Dawkins, Blackmore has erected an edifice that is both beautiful and useful.  Those who claim that 'this isn't THE meme book' are misdirecting you.  Anything more would be a ponderous, pedantic, psychology textbook.  Memetics is only now gaining attention from academics.  In the meantime, the rest of us can enjoy this excellent introduction to the idea.<br />It will be interesting to see how long it takes for the term 'meme' to supplant the lexicon of phrases previously conveying cultural ideas.  &quot;Shibboleth&quot; is, of course, too 'foreign' for the WASP mind to grasp intuitively or even speak clearly. &quot;Myth&quot; is crisp and brief, but also has been relegated to minor worth as something 'pagan' or out of time. &quot;Cultural icon&quot; conjures up images of rock stars or charismatic politicians. &quot;Meme&quot; has the advantages of universality; it's easy to remember, and doesn't carry any prior cultural overtones.  In an age of fast moving technologies, 'meme' is timely - after all, how many readers here haven't heard something about genetic research. &quot;Memetics&quot; sits easily on the mind and tongue alike.  Which is exactly what memes do.<br />Blackmore demonstrates how and why memes exist and work so effectively, and why an understanding of them is important to us all.  The most illogical concepts, like hereditary monarchy and christianity, remain with us against all reason.  Does their survival convey validity?  Only from the meme carrying them's point of view.  Memes that are well entrenched and adaptable to many environments are difficult to dislodge - that that is a meme's strength. Blackmore has gone beyond Dawkins' original idea in dealing with these complex social issues.  When a meme has become spread over a wide population it becomes a  &quot;memeplex.&quot;  Her chapter &quot;Religions As Memeplexes&quot; lucidly portrays the mindless power of memes to replicate and spread across disparate groups.  She is even able to link the forces of memes and genes as acting together in a feedback loop of replication and survival.<br />With a clear, unpretentious prose style, Blackmore offers all readers a look at what will become a fundamental treatise on how the human mind works.  And why the human condition is exceptional.  Human uniqueness is a basic issue in biology.  With memes and genes able to co-evolve and even affect the evolutionary path the other takes, the special place of humans in Nature needs explanation.  Blackmore provides answers to the many complex questions involved in defining humanity.  Her responses don't always go to great depth, but no reader will be left in doubt as to their validity.  She anticipates most objections to the meme concept.  That may make a few readers run off to find the authors in her references, but there's no doubt she would welcome that.<br />If you're confused about much of today's world, you should read this book.  If you have strongly held beliefs, unable to understand why others don't share them, you should read this book. If you're human, you should read this book.gth.

Giving stars to rate this book is misleading.  The book deserves five for style, but no more  than three for content.  Diamond is a convincing writer with an excellent prose style.  He  delves fully into his topics, presenting them lucidly,  demonstrating an ability to think deeply  before presenting his ideas to the reader.  His GUNS, GERMS AND  STEEL deserved every accolade it received.  THE THIRD CHIMPANZEE was a fine example  of innovative thinking, presented with clarity.  He deserves full marks for challenging readers  to consider their opinions and reflect on options previously unconsidered.  You don't need to  be a scientist to read him, you only need an open mind.<br />Diamond's theme is that human sexuality is not just different from that of the other  animals, but almost drastically so.  Reproductive strategies range from 'r' [sow 'em and forget  'em] through 'K' [no sacrifice is too great] with humans almost the ultimate K practitioners.  Evolutionary pressures on a creature that wasn't a good predator but fine prey led us down a path resulting in a massive investment in raising offspring.<br />What are the implications of our version of sexual techniques?  Human beings have  evolved in a way that natural sexual signals have been buried out of sight.  It's called  concealed ovulation and methods of pinpointing when a woman was likely to conceive  weren't developed until this century.  Fish, birds, and other mammals [particularly baboons]  exhibit colours, engage in ceremonial displays or have other visible indications that the time  is right!  But humans keep it a big secret.  Is there a valid reason?<br />And when a sexual coupling has generated a foetus, we put more time, energy and  resources to its birthing and upbringing than nearly any other animal.  Almost from the  instant of conception the foetus and the mother are at war over resource allocation.  Mum and  babe each want the calcium, iron and other factors required by the one for survival and the  other for growth.  All this is pretty draining on Mum, who still has a life to lead while  carrying that powerful parasite in her womb.<br />And where's Hubby during all this?  That is a major part of Diamond's account of human  sex relations.  Males invest minimal resources in producing offspring and in most mammal  species, decamp after coupling.  Human males, however, form part of the renowned 'nuclear  family'.  In the chapter &quot;What Are Men Good For?&quot;  Diamond shows how and why human  males are bonded to mates in a way few other species exhibit.  One major aspect of this bond,  of course, is the nearly constant availability of a sexual partner [NOT 'object'].  From that  derives that since human women can conceal their ovulation so well, he'd better stick around  to ensure any other offspring are indeed his.  Since she is receptive all the time and can  conceive at some indeterminate time, he'd better be there at the right time.  That this situation  doesn't always keep males in line is exemplified by the study showing that up to 20 per cent  of British babies were conceived by someone other than the purportive parent.<br />Diamond goes to some effort to make human males more captive to their familial role than  they might wish.  As stated, the minimal expenditure of some sperm to occupy a mate for a  year or so isn't always enough to foster a strong sense of responsibility in men.  However,  Diamond's proposed solution is one of the most astonishing ideas submitted by anyone yet.  He suggests that hormonal treatments for men, inducing lactation and giving men the chance  to learn the meaning of nurturing.  How much more 'politically correct' can one be?  One  hopes this chapter was written because of Marie adopting a Lysistratian role, witholding  favours until Diamond acceded to her demand for its inclusion.  That, or some life- threatening gesture are the only acceptable reasons for a man of Diamond's qualifications  trying to reverse the wholecourse of evolution and make humans even more unique among  the animals than they already are.  There are enough feminists out there trying to reverse the  status evolution has given us.  Diamond's suggestion nearly invalidates an otherwise  captivating and informative book.whole course of evolution and make humans even more unique among  the animals than they already are.

Merging a wealth of science and technical publications  with a philosophical drama, he's launched a fresh approach to sf prose.  The story relates the  life of Peter Hobson, who becomes a specialist in brain signal detection after witnessing a  corpse reacting to an organ transplant operation.  His research discloses that the brain indeed  possesses something that seems to transcend death.  Pursuing that issue, he records his own  brain signals, creating three identities.  Meanwhile, Hobson's a lovely, devoted,  wife betrays  him with a creep, devastating him.  The result is mysterious deaths, a world reaction to his  discovery and some heavy discussion on human values.<br />The debate over human consciousness, whether it exists, whether it's unique in the animal  kingdom and whether it has a long term essence, remains ongoing and intense.  Works on  evolution and sociobiology are permeated with the question of whether our ability to  communicate ideas reflects the existence of a spiritual element in humanity.  Ever since early  humans could perceive the idea of death the question of 'what happens after' has dominated  our thinking.  Sawyer makes a good effort to deal with the first part of the question: yes,  there's something there, and it's not limited to humans.  As to the afterlife, Sawyer raises the  question, then leaves it for a later book or someone else to decide.<br />The many comments below about Sawyer's characters reflect the maturity of his prose style.  Readers looking for simplistic people and predictable action are not pandered to in this book.  He introduces a devout Muslim AI engineer, surely a novel idea in speculative fiction, and a  graduate chemist unable to shed her childhood disappointments.  Current concepts of family  stress, with separations, sex, and parental tensions all become major features in this story.  While the characters here are mildly wooden [especially in comparison with Sawyer's later  books], their models are real enough.  Sawyer simply had too much philosophy and  technology to present in too few pages.  The lady copper, in particular, is a pretty fast thinker,  given the novelty of the circumstances.<br />The philosophy redeems any faults in this book.  We need to recognize where evolution has  brought us.  Sawyer touches that issue lightly, bringing the story to a level rarely  encountered.  We are left uncertain as to whether the concept of the soul is meaningful.  That  will leave some readers unsatisfied, but that's a major part of Sawyer's appeal.  He will raise  the questions, you must come up with some of the answer.story.

There's no doubt that Robert Sawyer can merge the most recent scientific concepts with  fictional narrative flawlessly.  Frameshift brings the latest revelations in genetic research to a  story of murder and conspiracy.  To that, he's added a strong historical element, rarely found  in speculative fiction.  The combination makes an overwhelming tale of perseverance in the  quest for justice.  This story is astonishingly relevant to today's circumstances.<br />Sawyer's characters are always excellent images.  His Canadians are a wonderfully disparate  group [Illegal Alien provides another good example].  Pierre's character is well drawn,  although probably the most 'heroic' of all Sawyer's characters.  It was surprising that he  remains silent on the issue of Quebec independence.  That Molly loves Pierre him because he  thinks in French, which doesn't intrude on her 'space', was a charming idea.<br />At first, Molly's telepathic abilities seemed to suggest Sawyer had finally exceeded credibility.  Telepathy, mysticism and inspiration from some divinity have too often been brought  together to inspire religion with all its hurtful dogmas.  That reaction was quelled after  reading a fellow Canadian, Sharon Butala.  Her non-fiction book, Wild Stone Heart, depicts a  perfectly rational person subjected to 'experiences' she can't explain.  Why do some people  have these 'visions' while others don't?  Perhaps, as Sawyer suggests here, there really is a  genetic base for telepathy.  It's an intriguing notion.<br />As usual, Sawyer's science is up to the minute.  The current attempts to restore extinct species  include the quagga, the thylacine [Tasmanian Devil] and even the Neanderthals Sawyer  depicts here.  He recognizes the need for a proper environment to make the restorations  succeed, in this case, Molly herself.  If it can happen, this is exactly the mechanism that will be  required.  He has detailed the process to perfection.  This is a highly readable book, stretching  the reader's mind just enough to maintain interest and some suspense.tching  the reader's mind just enough to maintain interest and some suspense.	2000-10-12

Neil Gaiman has the enviable ability to  rise above clich&eacute;s, presenting the story of a real man in bizarre circumstances.  Although born  of a faerie mother, Tristran's only power is persistence, a quality any human can emulate.  He  seeks a fallen star, which any of us would assume would be but a bit of iron rock.  This one,  when finally retrieved, turns out to be an astral nymph of very human temperment.  Along  his way, Tristran skirts a dispute over a royal inheritance, encounters a witch of supremely  wicked deviousness and helpful gnome.  The cast is as complete as any fantasy tale.  Gaiman  manages to breathe fresh spirit into this array of characters, lifting them from the common  images often found in such tales.<br />My introduction to Gaiman was his collaboration with Terry Pratchett in Good Omens.  Without prior experience of his work, it was difficult to separate the input of each author.  This book demonstrates PTerry's wisdom in choosing Gaiman to relate that tale of  Armageddon.  Gaiman has a fine prose style and draws his characters with skill.  His wit is  excellent, demonstrated in his resolution of the problem of how to have a week of two  Mondays.  This is a fine read for young and older alike.	2000-10-10

Morgan's books uniformly challenge traditional thinking.  Unlike her other works, which  postulate a novel thesis, then go on to provide conjectural evidence for its validity, this one is  a wealth of information which is finally brought into a conceptual framework.  In this book,  her theory of human evolution passing through an aquatic phase remains the basis for why  the human fetus develops in ways vastly different from our nearest biological neighbours, the  chimpanzees and great apes.<br />In order to establish a foundation for her claim, Morgan takes us along a highly detailed, but  characteristically readable, trek.  The journey commences at the moment of conception,  follows the stages of development of the human infant.  Along the way we are introduced to  the pros and cons of older theses of fetal progression.  The difficulties of birth are intense;  Morgan augments the event's hazards with abundant detail about the baby's physiognomic  changes occurring at this moment of entry into the world.  She manages to downplay much of  the mythology about 'birth trauma' by showing how evolution has equipped infants with  natural defenses against this abrupt shift of environment.<br />Morgan then continues the development of children and the many parental and other social  obstacles children endure.  Children spend an immense amount of time and energy in  learning to communicate.  Parents need to learn to listen to these efforts and understand the  process more adequately.  While Judith Rich Harris' THE NURTURE ASSUMPTION hadn't  been published when this book was written, Morgan stresses the strong impact of peers on  children's development.  As Rich Harris points out, this area needs further attention,  although it's doubtful it would change Morgan's ideas.<br />Morgan's ultimate goal in this book is two-fold.  Children's  individuality is poorly addressed  by our society.  The idea of children being 'little adults' must be abandoned in favour of fuller  understanding of how a child functions and why the differences between adults and children  are important.  She is sharply critical of conditions in the UK [which can readily be projected  to North America] dealing with children's needs.<br />The other goal Morgan seeks, of course, is wider acceptance of her notion that fetal and infant  differences between us and the other apes is symptomatic of different evolutionary paths.  Her physiological evidence is clearly presented and lucidly explained.  What is lacking, of  course, is valid fossil evidence in support of the idea.  The area that might provide that  evidence remains under water, which is where the thesis must reside, as well.<br />Morgan's prose style is clear and unpretentious.  It's hard to dispute information so well  organized and lucidly presented.  She panders to the FemiNazis with lengthy excuses for  referring to babies as 'he'; space which could better have been used to review her thesis in  more detail.  Still, like her other books, this one raises many questions requiring answers, not  evasion.

Although this isn't among Sawyer's best, the issue he raises is one worthy of further  discussion.  'Free will' remains one of the most compelling of human ideas.  With geneticists  demonstrating the impetus given our behaviour by our DNA, what is inevitable and what is  left to chance?  What actually drives our behaviour and how far into the future might we be  able to predict?  If we can garner a glimpse of the future, will that future necessarily be fixed?  Sawyer gives us one means of assessing that question, although the technique he uses here is  questionable.  His resolution is far more mechanistic than anything even the sociobiologists have  suggested.<br />It's fascinating to read critiques of Sawyer's characterizations.  Depicting persona is easily  Sawyer's finest quality as a writer.  His characters may not be charming nor even heroic, but  they are certainly real people in every sense of the term.  Lloyd Simcoe [how Canadian!!] can  be readily condemned for his waffling, but the description of his mental gyrations are  portrayed with fidelity.  Theo's obsession with avoiding an untimely demise is hardly far- fetched under the circumstances.  Even Cheung, a man of vast wealth and power, while not  an original figure, is certainly conveyed from genuine models.  What person of his status  wouldn't undertake the realization of immortality if the chance presented itself?<br />Those critical of Sawyer's scientific basis are simplistic.  His science is sound, but shouldn't be  taken as providing any final resolution to the many questions he raises.  The issues remain  open until we've delved much further into ourselves and the universe around us.  The real  problem with this story is Sawyer's ultimate acceptance of the Frank Tipler model of the  future of humanity.  Humans appear wholly incapable of envisioning that along with the rest  of the animal kingdom we will go extinct.  This is particularly amazing in view of the fact that  we seem to be bringing that about ourselves.  The Dyson sphere is a human-centred idea  overlooking the diversity of life on this planet.  A beautiful idea, but one dooming the  remaining life on our world.  Could we truly become immortal in such an environment?t about ourselves.

Robert Sawyer here shows how that conflict not  only crosses cultural lines, but species ones, as well.  Merging the lives of Earth's Copernicus,  Galileo, Kepler and Newton into one dinosauroid individual, he recapitulates three centuries  of striving to understand Nature's secrets.  Each worked in fear of the church's displeasure,  addressing the absolute monopoly with various levels of success.  Sawyer presents Afsan as  one determined to reveal truth at whatever cost.  Afsan uses the first telescope to examine the  heavens, challenging the established tradition of the role of priests and their dogmas.  The  discoveries are too important to allow the priests to quell them.  Afsan knows the future of his  race is at stake.<br />Although Sawyer must compress many people and events into one modestly heroic character,  it doesn't detract from the quality of this book.  Making dinosaurs into near humans takes a  special skill, but Sawyer manages it with little falsity.  He exhibits a vivid imagination, but  doesn't let it run away with his presentation.  While the portrait of a race still using claws for  emotional expression and hunting while building a civilization of stone, metal and ships may  give the purist pause, Sawyer's story-telling abilities overcomes these doubts.  The book  remains an entertaining and clever interpretation.  For the fullest enjoyment, of course, the  next two volumes become mandatory reading.	2000-10-02

This lapse mightbe forgiven if the book didn't condemn the Parisian rapist whileexonerating a woman 'therapist' who's had a long career warping theminds of young women.

Only a woman such asHeather Davis would be selfish enough to use the most advancedtechnology encountered to determine her husband's guilt or innocenceof the abuse charge.  Most fiction would have Kyle instantly shed hisanger over the recanted accusation.  That it lingers in him from sucha monumental injustice is truly a human characteristic.

Especially a world dominated not by thinking primates like ours, but by dinosaurs.  Robert Sawyer's Toroca, son of savants on the Quintaglio world becomes just that during an expedition to the Southern Pole of his world.  He wonders about the origins of the bizarre creatures he encounters there, arriving at the conclusion they are in fact birds - an unknown species except in the fossil record.<br />Toroca's father, Afsan, is meanwhile caught up in the defense of the Emperor of the Quintaglio.  Facing more than simply a palace revolution, the future of the Quintaglio people may be hanging in the balance. Challenged by a brother to relinquish the throne, Dybo is coached by Afsan in preparation for a test of strength to answer the challenge.  As so often happens, cunning, not strength, is the determining factor in the outcome.  Afsan must also confront the novelty of murder, rare in Quintaglio society.  Adding to the stress is the fact that the victims are his  own children.<br />Sawyer develops the theme of a society alien to ours, but with significant parallels.  His tactics in presenting the Quintaglio are effective.  It's an interesting concept.  The trilogy makes a good addition to any speculative fiction collection.	2000-09-23

Robert Bakker has become a major name linked with the resurgence of attention given these [almost] extinct animals.  This book shows why Bakker's elevated position is deserved - and why his assertions are resented by some of his colleagues.  His observations challenge lazy thinking - by his colleagues and the rest of us also.<br />Holding to dogma is easy.  Bakker knows that challenging conventional' judgment requires innovative thinking backed by solid evidence.  It's precisely the problem Darwin faced when  introducing evolution through natural selection.  The evidence is there, it simply takes a perceptive eye and logical thinking to clarify its meaning.  Bakker is able to perform those feats, bringing fine writing in to use vigorously presenting his onclusions .  Much of the fossil data has an extensive history. He has an uncanny ability to make field research understood by a wide spectrum of readers.  No arcane ivory-tower scientist here; evidence and conclusions are clear and unambiguous.  Supporting his prose are fine illustrations ranging from serious reconstructions to clever speculation.<br />Bakker has contributed useful concepts to anyone wishing to nderstand evolution's processes.  His discussion of predator/prey relationships, old news to biologists, is demystified for the rest of us.  The ratio of hunters to hunted, strategies of attack and defense, solitary or pack hunting or defense all mark the guerrilla warfare life's been involved in over the eons.  By stretching the definition, predator and prey may also include plant eaters and their fodder.  We normally view predation as shedding blood and providing meat, but Bakker demonstrates the war of herbivores and plants to be just as dramatic, if slower.  All these elements combine in the ecological environment in evolution's drama.<br />If there is a flaw here, it's in Bakker's acceptance of Gould and Eldredge's 'punctuated equilibrium' thesis.  It's anomalous that a researcher so fastidious about assessing evidence can accept an idea lacking supporting data.  Bakker's heretical outlook makes him a logical associate of iconoclasts like Eldredge and Gould, so perhaps he may be forgiven this lapse.

Sawyer addresses fundamental questions with a  clarity rarely approached by today's fiction writers.  Why are there 'forces' in nature which  exceed all logic?  We've accepted gravity and electromagnetism for centuries.  The strong and  weak nuclear forces have been deduced.  None of these forces truly make sense.  They can be  measured, but they can't be known.  Atomic nuclei should fly apart and the issue of light as  wave or particle remains unresolved.  So why do these abnormal phenomena exist?  Whell, it  turns out that's what the Sprite used to make Nature work.<br />Sawyer has updated the old philosophy of Deism.  Concerned by their inability to reconcile  Biblical dogma with what was being observed in nature, 18th Century thinkers simply  pushed the Judeo-Christian god further into the background.  The god had wound up the  clock of the universe, then sat back observing what transpired.  Sawyer has adapted this idea  to accommodate the findings of modern scientific revelations.  It's an impressive  achievement.<br />His research is visible on every page - either he has a stunning library, or owes a bag of  money to the local public one.  Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Timothy Ferris are all here  along with Gregory Paul and Earl Cox [Beyond Humanity - read it].  Even Terry Pratchett  puts in an appearance.  Sawyer's science is solid - it's clear he's no amateur.  He doesn't have  to make anything up - the realities of Nature are bizarre enough.  He merely stirs in some  fresh ideas about possible alien life forms and lifestyles.  And what they might be like if the  whole shebang was actually initiated by The Sprite instead of a random singularity.<br />There's some heavy irony and a few anomalies here.  Occupational Health and Safety issues  for a paleontologist?  It used to be limited to rattlesnakes and mosquitoes.  Jericho is facing  the Great Mystery, but the issue of an afterlife remains unresolved.  If The Goggle Box and  radio broadcasts don't cover science well enough, why is Hollus a walking Cambridge  Catalog of stellar bodies?  The Wreeds and Forhilnors managed to escape a nuclear holocaust,  but no mention is made of why they came so close.  Do those two alien races have nations like  on Earth?  Jericho never thinks to ask Hollus for a universal translator of his own.  He could  have become President of the Earth.  The Christian vandals at first appear to be a non- sequitur.  They don't seem necessary in the story, but Sawyer has a subtle use for them.  If  humanity will become immortal and The Sprite really exists, paleontology will become  irrelevant.  It's an interesting prospect.  These aren't flaws in the book, merely more thought  experiments we should all consider performing in assessing real human values.he Goggle Box and  radio broadcasts don't cover science well enough, why is Hollus a walking Cambridge  Catalog of stellar bodies?

Having been introduced to Ferris through his photographic essay 'Galaxies'  and 'The Red  Limit', The Whole Shebang was welcome new work.  It proved to  be fine work, indeed.  Ferris  has a fine knack for science writing, and  cosmology must be the most challenging task of all.  After all, he's  dealing with the universe.<br />Beginning with a brief history of thought on  cosmology, he moves into the research of light's  properties.  This  foundation is central to our understanding of why the universe is the  result  of a single massive explosion from which space-time evolved to  today's cosmological limits.  It was Darwin who provided the framework  within which we've arrived at that awareness.  By offering natural  selection as evolution's process, he focussed thinking about the time  needed for life's mechanisms to work.  From extending the history of life,  it was only logical  to revise the age of the universe.<br />Ferris captures  the history of expanding cosmology with lucid explanations of the  reseachers  and their findings.  Providing background summaries of the  people contributing to  cosmology, he positions each within the astrophyics  community.  Performing the observer's  role with finesse, he notes flaws,  but leaves judgments to each scientist's peers.  He guides us  through the  ideas, proofs and results of study effortlessly.  The reading may sometimes  be  slow, but Ferris' thorough presentation leaves the reader rich with  information.  His lively  prose eliminates tedium, even with such a vast  and complex topic.<br />This book wouldn't be complete without addressing the  ultimate question.  Human cultures,  confronted with the mysterious canopy  'above' us', for ages assigned some 'higher being'  responsibility for  manufacturing all those stars and things.  He presents the very human  problem that the more we learn of the cosmos, the more mysterious it  becomes.  Isn't it logical  that a deity must be responsible for it all.  By reviewing the research that has gone into  understanding natural laws,  uncovered at such expense of time and energy, he reviews the  various  opinions addressing how it all came to be in a 'Theological Afterward'.  This section is  so well done that a reader might well start with it before  reading the opening chapter.  In the  end Ferris puts the problem simply:  'the fact that something seems mysterious does not mean  that God did it.  We would clearly be better off if we left God out of cosmology altogether'.  It's a succinct, logical conclusion to a superb presentation.ewing the research that has gone into  understanding natural laws,  uncovered at such expense of time and energy, he reviews the  various  opinions addressing how it all came to be in a 'Theological Afterward'.

Carl Sagan's writings range from excellent to  outstanding, and  Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors ranks at the zenith of his  efforts.  Taking us along the history  of life, he vividly explains how  close we are to the other animals inhabiting this planet.  The  theme rests  on the continuity of life, from the simplest cells through the complex  creatures.  Since zoology for so long focused on the 'special place' of  humanity in nature, Sagan builds an  exceptional case for returning us to  our true origins.  With the prejudices we've inherited  from our various  cultures, the task is daunting, but he manages it with irrefutable logic.  His  prose brings our associates in the animal kingdom into distinct focus,  overcoming human  penchants for uniqueness with clarity and wit.  Copernicus removed us from the centre of the  universe.  Darwin showed life  as an evolutionary process.  Sagan removes the final veil of our  self  aggrandizement.<br />After a description of DNA's development over the ages,  he brings us to our nearest genetic  neighbours, the primates.  His section  titled 'Some Sketches from Life' points up numerous  behaviour patterns  shared among us all.  Communication, grief, vulnerability to illnesses,  raising young - the list seems almost endless.  The result is the  replacement of our 'special  status' by a clearer identity as a community  of primates.  Tell your friends that only 0.4% of  our working genes and  that of chimpanzees are different.  If they dispute you, buy them a  copy  of this book and sit them down to read it.  From the first page they will  encounter mind  opening ideas.  Sagan stresses our kinship with other  animals, and begs us all to 'stop  pretending we're something we're not' -  a dominant species with a mandate to rule the planet  and its  occupants.<br />Sagan handles the 'god' question with delicacy.  Surprisingly,  he makes no assault on deities,  but gently goes over the history of life  and what we've learned of its mechanisms.  Humans  who argue that  'consciousness' and the idea of a 'soul' are shown to be illusory.  His  final  analysis simply outlines in brief detail how the process of life has  evolved, concluding that  deities are simply unnecessary [p. 472].  Read  the book and suggest it to friends.

The geographic  limitation omits haunted castles in  Britain, elephant tusk powder for potency in China, or  papal  infallibility, but none of these interest his immediate audience.  As an  American  skeptic, Shermer is here seeking to expose irrational beliefs,  presumably in the hope better  education will result in fewer aberrant  ideas.  By showing readers what some people believe,  spending pages  exposing the fallacies in those beliefs, he's challenging us all to take up  the  cause in his behalf.  That's an admirable quest, deserving attention  and applause.<br />Discussing the transmission of weird ideas, Shermer traces  expansion of one of the European  'witch crazes' during the 17th Century.  This topic is one worthy of further pursuit.  Many  modern delusions follow  patterns often discounted as 'mob hysteria'.  In a modern episode,  he  cites the Satanic Cults of this century in showing such events recur.  Shermer's book shows  the importance of plumbing these occurrences in the  hope of applying some preventive  medicine.  The medicine is rational  thinking, which this book shows isn't limited to the  educate elite.  If  Shermer can attract more people to take the time to understand and care  about what is happening in their society he's done what he set out to do.  What you, as a  reader, must do is extend his appeal - tell the media loud  and clear that you don't want them  to enhance belief in 'weird things' by  spending so much time on them.<br />Some reviewers have complained this book  lacks depth.  The 'why' of these errant ideas is  incomplete or lacking,  but the book isn't intended as a deep psychological study.  There are  references in the bibliography for that topic.  This book is an appeal for  awareness - readers  will learn the strange ideas his subjects have and who  else believes them.  Shermer can only  be admired for his courage in  exposing these mythologies.  Shermer's call for reason deserves  a wide and  attentive audience.

It is utterly timeless in  conveying all we went through at one level or  another in those ancient  days.  Reading this book is an indication of why many of us have  quashed  those images - the cost of painful recall is often too great to bear.  How  much did  Doyle pay in order to dredge it all up again and present these  recollections for our delighted  reading?  Whether this account is  autobiographical is of no matter - what Doyle expresses  gives voice to  many wishing to be heard.  If some would only listen!<br />Those who discern  little plot in this book should reflect on their own lives.  Can you trace  the  steps leading to now from when you were 10 years old?  It may seem  easy now.  Doyle  superbly expresses the complexity of a boy's life.  Elders view it with simple minds.  Paddy  must balance life with his family  with that of his gang, his teachers, learning about himself  against  conflicting views of others.  Kids don't have it as easy as we like to  think.  Parents  devised the ignorant dictum that 'children should be seen  but not heard' with the result that  boys like Paddy expend immense amounts  of energy forging an identity for themselves.<br />Reviewers here make much of  the Irish city setting of this book.  Bosh!  Urban, rural, Eire,  Canada,  Germany - all could find in children's lives a compelling topic.  The  locale is  meaningful in the expressions Doyle uses to impart his ideas.  There's merit in contending  that only an Irish writer could do this tale  full justice.  Doyle's tale is a cry from the heart, a  characteristic many  attribute to a Gaelic inheritance.  No matter, Paddy's story is truly  universal.  Every parent should read it carefully.  Every bookshelf should  contain a copy.	2000-09-12

Either way,  press on to the text, rich  rewards await your persistence.  Conway Morris offers a memorable  account  of assessing the fossil evidence of one of biology's more striking finds.  The Burgess  Shale's disclosure of fossilized soft-bodied creatures is a  captivating story, one which was not,  contrary to the views of many, fully  resolved by Stephen Gould's account.<br />So much attention has been given to  the grandeur of the dinosaurs, other eras of importance  in life's pageant  have too often been overlooked.  The Cambrian era described so vividly by  Conway Morris was a time when evolution's processes were already well under  way.  His  account, partially supporting Walcott's original descriptions,  is based on hard, reflective  investigation and reassessment of the fossil  evidence.  Using techniques unavailable in  Walcott's day, Conway Morris  and his colleagues delicately pieced together a new picture of  how the  Cambrian life forms looked and how they must have lived.  His imaginative  use of  'time travel' to depict these creatures is a fine innovation in  reporting science.  He's to be  commended for stimulating thinking about  evidence.<br />While Conway Morris doesn't write with Gould's more florid  style, his presentation has  presented us with a much more valuable  account.  Gould spends too much time disparaging  Walcott's lack of effort  in analyzing the shale.  Gould's advocacy of 'contingency' as an  evolutionary mechanism supporting his misleading 'punctuated equilibrium'  thesis is rightly  assaulted by Conway Morris.  Conway Morris, by focussing  on strong scientific work,  demonstrates that flighty contentions cannot  replace solid scientific analysis.  He provides the  reader with a stirring  account of the research leading to the reassessment achieved by his  team.  The result is a solid, highly readable account of the Burgess finds.  This  book is a fine  replacement for the only work we've had available on this  topic.by his  team.   The result is a solid, highly readable account of the Burgess finds.

Beginning by describing  how 'history is swamped by patriotic  myths about the summer of 1940',  Deighton invalidates any theories of heroes versus villains  in this  account.  The Nazi war machine swept across Western Europe in a stunning  series of  victories.  Only the English Channel and the RAF remained as the  final barriers to invasion.  It  was the Luftwaffe's burden to remove the  second obstacle leaving the first to be crossed with  minimal opposition.  Deighton's excellent account shows how close the Luftwaffe came to  success.  In fact, credit for the RAF's accomplishment may well come to  rest on the shoulders  of one man, Hugh Dowding.<br />Deighton takes us  through the background of weapons development, from radar to the tracer  bullet, explaining how the two sides were closely matched in technology.  The long-standing  dispute over whether the Bf109 or the Spitfire was  superior rests only on how far the pilots  were prepared to push their  aircraft.  The number of pilots in opposition are another matter.  For  every active RAF pilot, the Germans had four fighter pilots or bomber  crews, ranging  from central France to the Norwegian coast..  Deighton  explains how Dowding husbanded his  resources, enabling  him to keep  sending aircraft against the bomber fleets.  All logic  suggested the RAF  should have been destroyed, but Dowding's strategy and pilot skill  resulted in postponement of the German invasion.<br />Deighton brings clarity  to this complex period by breaking the story into four main themes.  Keeping the daily events of the battle until last, his prepatory chapters  show vividly what the  pilots faced and what factors led to victory or  defeat.  Readers of his fiction know how well he  presents characters.  This historical account also displays that talent admirably.  Commanders,  pilots, ground forces all come to life in his depiction.  There are both  good and  bad at all levels and he pulls no punches in discussing them  all.<br />To those who feel Fighter is simply 'military history', it must be  stressed that the Summer of  1940 was a magnificent expression of human  endeavour.  Pilot and crew bravery, tenacity in  striving for goals on both  sides is presented with Deighton's fine prose.  Deighton shows that  today's world would be drastically different had the Luftwaffe succeeded in  its attempt to  clear the way for an invasion.

As an account of a single Lancaster night raid, it's without peer in  portraying the lives of people enduring the  horrors of war in any age.  Deighton's skill at depicting characters has few matches, and the scope of  this book, set in both Germany and England [as well as the skies above  both] only  enhances his writing abilities.  Following the lives of bomber  and night fighter crews as well as those living under bombardment, he shows  how meaningless war is to the most hawkish  adherents.  It's not possible  to read this book without being moved by how well Deighton sees into the  minds and hearts of his characters.  None of them are false or  overdrawn.<br />'Strategic' bombing was implemented to maintain pressure on  the Nazis in the hope of forcing sufficient discontent among the  population.  John Dos Passos once wrote on the futility of using 'terror'  bombing to bring surrender of a people whose loved ones were killed and  their homes destroyed.  Bomber shows how barren this strategy truly was.  It didn't work when London was blitzed.  It certainly failed when even  target cities were missed completely due to unforeseen circumstances.  Deighton takes us step by step from the preparation of the aircraft and the  defenses countering it through the raid and its aftermath.  His portrayal  of the 'military mind' is disconcerting when we reflect that the same  attitudes prevail with little or no evidence of improvement.  This book  should be brought back on the active list and read by anyone seeing armed  conflict as a mechanism of policy.	2000-09-06

Beginning with his personal Path to  Atheism, he provides the  skeptic with methods of argument and several readings.  He gives  accounts  of those Christian philosophers who wrote against atheists and heretics.  Heretics, of  course, have been subjected to the severest punishments in  the Christian churches, for a soul  lost is more serious than an  unconverted heathen.<br />Smith's discussion of Deism is the highlight of this  book.  As a philosophy accepting a god  without a structured religious  organization, Deism was a major theme among critics of  Christianity.  Abolishment of church hierarchies, with their inevitable moral and monetary  corruption, led many thinkers to leave Christianity in favour of a  personal relationship with a  deity.  Many of the Founding Fathers of the  United States adhered to this view, a product of  the European  Enlightenment of the 18th Century.  Arising coincidentally with many  philosophies of personal freedom, it was almost inevitable that a nation  experimenting with  democratic ideals would espouse it.  Smith's essay on  the writings of Deists is enlightening.<br />Smith's discussion of Ayn Rand's  ideas came as a bit of a shock.  It's difficult to find anyone,  apart from  a few feminists, in this era who knows who she was.  Smith's account of her  life  includes a smattering of choice quotations, but the brevity of the  entries demonstrates the  paucity of adherents.  There is an Ayn Rand  Institute site on the 'Net, but seems hardly worth  the bother.<br />The two  essays on public education and the War on Drugs are heartfelt expressions  of a true  libertarian.  Neither will add to Smith's popularity in a nation  where 'Christian virtues' reign  with such strength, but they're required  reading for anyone who wishes to understand views  other than the accepted  'norm'.  Smith appears to forget that public education in the United  States, even given its Puritan foundation, was furthered by a desire to  free education from the  thrall of an Established Church.  The struggling  economy of a growing nation would have led  more children into hazardous  and fatiguing work situations from which they would never  recovered.  Extending the years of compulsory education freed many children and opened  job  opportunities.  The result put more women into the work force,  ultimately leading to  improving their role in society.<br />Smith confesses  his lack of a formal education, but he's certainly managed a wealth of  research to produce this book.  Not a deep study of the challenges to  established thinking, this  book is a valid starting point for those  seeking further knowledge of libertarian thinking.ith appears to forget that public education in the United   States, even given its Puritan foundation, was furthered by a desire to  free education from the  thrall of an Established Church.

Over time, joined by other molecules of  similar talent, they grew complex, finally  forming organisms.  Seeking  food, needing rest, hiding from hungry fellows, developing sex  as an  offshoot of replication skills, patterns of activity emerged - behaviour.  The molecules  altered form as external environment changed.  Successful  changes were kept, while others  were left inert in storage.  None were  discarded, and those controlling basic body structure  and fundamental  behaviour patterns remained intact across the wide span of living things.  After over 3 billion years of life traversing this path, one of the  organisms set out to determine  how it all worked.<br />Jonathan Weiner's  relation of a century of research teasing into view DNA's mechanisms for  guiding  behaviour is a brilliant piece of science writing.  His focus is  Seymour Benzer and his  research team  studied flies, recording how  changing conditions modified conduct.  It became clear that 'dumb' animals  could adapt through learning.  Not only adapt, but retain memories to  repeat the new behaviour when  needed.  By the end of the 20th Century, the  research began to identify where along the structure of DNA  the  operational level of these behaviour codes resided.  As often as not a  single 'letter' change in the gene  was found to trigger the change.  More  immediately, the information revealed in fruit flies was repeated in  other  animals.  Duplicating the finds in mammals has overwhelming implications  for humans.<br />Weiner's account is forcefully presented in a clear, direct  style.  This book is a supreme  example science writing at its very summit.  He offer no judgements of his own.  It isn't  necessary for him to flaunt  the victory Benzer's research grants E. O. Wilson's sociobiology.  In  fact, Weiner's account of Richard Lewontin's objections to relating genetic  bases of  behaviour to humans simply lets Lewontin hang himself out to dry.  Weiner clearly values the  effort invested in the research by Benzer, Tim  Tully, Chip Quinn, and, of course, the  paramount figure of all, Thomas  Hunt Morgan who, with Alfred Sturtevant, initiated the  work so long  ago.<br />If you wish to gain insight into your place in the natural universe,  this book is a must read.  If  you adhere to the idea that evolution is a  progressive path to humans as the ultimate goal,  this book is a must read.

With his usual scope and fine  prose, he presents us with carefully  researched and captivating subjects.  All his essays are stimulating exercises in challenging  traditional ways  of thinking on a wide spectrum of subjects.<br />The opening essay on  Leonardo da Vinci provides a picture of a thinker challenged by  mysterious  evidence, expertly addressed.  Da Vinci displays more humanity here than  revealed by viewing his works.  Fossil seashells at mountain peaks were  puzzled over for  centuries.  Leonardo's vivid analysis might have enhanced  scientific inquiry greatly if his  ideas had not ran counter to church  dogmas.<br />The remaining essays span the usual gamut of resurrecting the  reputations of scientists now  often lost to view.  While restoring some  scientists in our estimation, he manages to erode that  of others just a  bit.  Huxley, having been knocked off a high pedestal by an earlier essay  of  Gould's is subtly chided here once more for racist opinions.  Richard  Owen, who used some  truly underhanded tactics in responding to Darwin's  theory of Natural Selection, is given  more leniency.  Racism is a durable  commodity, as Gould himself readily admits in  describing his own feelings  about taxing pedal-powered vehicles in Africa.  It behooves him  to grant  Huxley a bit of leeway.  Huxley, 'Darwin's Bulldog' in his unqualified  support for  natural selection, must necessarily be besmirched a bit in  keeping with Gould's own efforts in  evolutionary revisionism.<br />Having  addressed NOMA in comments about Gould's bizarre work ROCKS OF AGES,  dwelling on the essay here would be inappropriate.  Suffice to say, the  concept verges on the  irrational, a rare circumstance in Gould's otherwise  fine collection.  Far more impressive are  the two essays, As the Worm  Turns and Triumph of the Root-heads are among his best work.  Every new  discovery in biology raises our consciousness of our place in Nature.  The  description of the bizarre parasites inhabiting the body's of crabs is a  superb challenge to  rigid thinking about evolution's methods.  We're  frequently reminded that evolution never  works 'backwards', but this essay  confirms again how unpredictable life can be in adapting to  new  environments.  Keep this book where the children can reach it.  It will  provide hours of  delightful reading - not just one reading, but many..

Wilson,  author of so many wonderful ideas and books, has here  revealed himself as a human being of  immense strength and courtly  self-awareness.  Sharing with us so many aspects of his  personal life and  scientific endeavors, Wilson shows how a bit of dedication can overcome  obstacles most of us find daunting.  Raised in the rural South, losing the  sight of one eye, his  struggles to gain a place as a scientist  are  inspiring.  More importantly, he makes clear how  much remains to be done  by the upcoming generations in determining our true place in the  natural  order.  This work is a clarion call for aspiring young scientists to enter  research,  following paths similar to his own.<br />The editorial reviews here  focus overmuch on the sociobiology 'controversy'.  Sociobiology is  a major  thesis in examining humanity's place in nature.  Rejecting this idea out of  hand  continues to impair understanding of how important an idea  sociobiology is, although he  spends little time on it in this book.  Much  of his work has focussed on animal behaviour  from ants through mammals.  People remain resistant to the idea that we are somehow  associated with  'the beasts', but Wilson demonstrates the continuity of behaviour patterns  throughout the animal kingdom.  Until we address that issue honestly, which  is a major  aspect of Wilson's work, we will never understand who we truly  are.  His studies stress that  until we achieve that understanding, we will  continue to unwittingly intrude on our own  environment.  The loss of  species threatens our own existence.<br />The major advantage of this book is  its honesty.  Wilson pulls few punches and reviews his  own prejudices and  how he overcame them.  He demonstrates how important this self  assessment  is to scientists and the public alike.  The growth of understanding of  genetics has  impacted all biology. Wilson relates candidly his own  grudging acceptance of the new ideas  genetic research have given us.  He's  to be commended for both his candor and flexibility.is own  grudging acceptance of the new ideas  genetic research have given us.

After devising The Truth  Machine to restructure  American society, he now turns to making that  culture immortal.  There's little doubt that  Halperin's done his research.  The concepts he presents are all plausible, even if his people  are a  pretty stiff bunch.  Experiments in cryonics may well burgeon soon,  especially with the  increased knowledge gained in genetics in recent  years.  His frozen people, some of whom  were damaged in their tanks, are  restored to life in the future by application of busy little  molecules  that swarm through their bodies rebuilding damaged tissues.  Rather reminds  one  of the Doozers on Fraggle Rock.  Finally, of course, people jump at  the opportunity for  replicating themselves as a form of data 'backup' in  the event of catastrophe.<br />The characters in this book are the same lineup  of wealthy leaders of society we saw in The  Truth Machine - doctors,  lawyers, artists [a successful one, anyway].  Politicians are blessedly  overlooked, or perhaps denied the option.  We may view Ass't DA Butters as  a special case,  since the position isn't elective.  Their motivations are  incredibly narrow and selfish.  The  doctor doesn't return to healing after  'reviv'.  The women are more concerned with family  than any social  questions.  Indeed, the social impact of this concept is conveniently  ignored.  We are offered not a glimpse of how this technology would truly  impact society at large.  There is some discussion of new forms of  addictions.  Internet surfers are replaced by people  withdrawing into  Virtual Reality environments.  Again, these are realms of the affluent, not  for some grunt living on Main Street.<br />As he did in The Truth Machine,  Halperin is here expressing the world view of the American  Protestant  conservative.  If their is a humorous part of this book, it's the video  conference  between the Pope and a group of cardinals.  Why the church  would so readily accept the idea  of human immortality with such aplomb  beggars understanding.  Again, the impact of this  new technology on other  cultures is totally ignored.  Human beings fear of death is the basis  for  every religion.  Christianity, almost alone among religions, has removed  dignity from  death with its stress on afterlife punishment.  It would be  interesting to see a review here by  someone of another culture.<br />The  ideas contained in this book must be considered, neither ignored nor  rejected out of  hand.  Read this book for its ideas.  But take it out of  the library, don't insult your library by  giving it a permanent place on  your shelves.ily accept the idea  of human immortality with such aplomb  beggars understanding.

And why Sociobiology  will arise as one of the most original  ideas in modern biology.  This book  is a fine introduction to how the mechanisms of the genes  work  Lewin's  outstanding reputation can only be enhanced by this description of gene  analysis and function.  He explains many facets of gene research with  superb illustrations  and sidebar text describing the various analytical  techniques molecular biologists use to  explain life's diversity and  history.<br />Why are there so many forms of life?  Textbooks abound with  evolutionary 'trees' purporting  to explain how life evolved from simple  cells, lacking even a primitive nucleus through the  complex creatures  around us today.  Most of these diagrams are fallacious, burdening our  understanding with the idea that evolution is 'progressive'.  Lewin's  account, laced with more  realistic graphics, show that all forms of life  that once existed, still do in parallel with our own  companions on this  planet.  This book does a superior job relating how molecular biology has  enabled researchers to update the picture of humanity's place in the  structure of nature.  Lewin builds his picture of the human role slowly  and carefully, but at the conclusion, you  will find he's performed the  task to near perfection.

Having watched some  of this series on the Goggle  Box, i was only mildly interested in starting  SIMISOLA.  What a pleasant experience this  book proved to be.  The  characters are superbly drawn, Wexford particularly so, but the  Akande  family was portrayed exquisitely.  A sympathetic view into another culture  is always  welcome, since we ofays rarely have a proper glimpse into other  worlds.  This book strongly  reflects the issues facing the UK's race  relations today, the Stephen Lawrence murder case  being a vivid example.  Wexford's self confrontations are the highlights of this book.  One hopes  it's not a racist comment to request that someone from the  Black community  read and comment on this book for its accuracy.<br />This book, having led me  to other Rendall works, led me to wonder just what the story  behind its  writing might be.  SIMISOLA is so far superior to any of the other works i  read that  i can't help question who might have co-authored it.  Rendall  has a high reputation, which i  can't judge having so little experience  with the genre.  No matter, this is an outstanding read  and a fine  addition to any bookshelf.  The mystery is almost a minor matter set  against some  stunning revelations about race relations anywhere in the  English speaking world.  Buy, read  and reflect on this book.	2000-08-23

An amazing range of  cultures have developed nearly identical  attitudes and practices in coping with the mysteries  of life.  Where did  this universality originate?  Burkert sees its roots in the deep time of  pre- literate humanity.  He makes this connection loosely, but the  connection is surely there.  Loss  of body parts by trapped or threatened  animals becomes ritual sacrifice in humans.  Social  hierarchy in primates  becomes kneeling before an altar with downcast eyes, submitting to  some  superior entity.  These habits, practiced over endless generations have  almost certainly  become entrenched in the genetic messages making up each  of us.  There might just be a gene  for religion by now, although Burkert  avoids such a radical assertion.  The logic behind his  contentions  clamors for acceptance; the validity of Burkert's assertions too thoroughly  supported to contest.  In Burkert's<br />Although there are other books on  comparative elements in religion, few have drawn the  picture so clearly;  none have reached into such our distant past in seeking origins of  religious  practices.  He assembles a wealth of supportive material, much  of it European in origin.  Historically, European religious attitudes have  anticipated those in North America; Ernest  Renan in France, for example,  preceded Robert Ingersoll in America.  Burkert, however, has  confined  himself too much in reviewing his sources in compiling this book.  His  studies have  stopped at the water's edge by ignoring two decades of  development of Richard Dawkins'  suggestion that cultural elements, such as  religion, are the result of the memes.<br />While Burkert superbly describes  the universal aspects of religious practice, he fails to  present us with  the reasons for its persistence.  In the most literate age in human  history, why  does a concept as illogical as 'god' continue to draw on such  a wealth of human time and  resources?  The science of memetics, which  bases its theory on replication and dissemination  in imitation of genetic  methods, would have been the fulfilling conclusion to Burkert's  otherwise  flawless analysis of religion's survival.  His conclusion argues that  'direct  imprinting of parental attitudes, nor arbitrary transfer of  information [by which we assume  'not traceable] can account for it['s  success]'.  Yet these two mechanisms are precisely the way  memes, cultural  principles transmitted over generations, works.  You need not go all the  way  to the end of the book; simply review the opening chapter and use  'meme' to account for each  of the factors Burkert lists in the inventory  of topics he further develops.  Not one eludes the  definition of how a  meme functions.<br />This lack of addressing a concept that has been with us  for a generation doesn't flaw this  book, it merely renders it incomplete.  Read Burkert closely for he has much to say and says it  well.  Then go  pick up Susan Blackmore's THE MEME MACHINE for the complete picture.  The  pair will complete any library's collection of religious studies.  Only  someone bringing  these two concepts together will further add to your  thinking on 'why we believe'.ory, why  does a concept as illogical as 'god' continue to draw on such  a wealth of human time and  resources?

Scientists now accept that the dinosaurs were exterminated by the impact of a large asteroid  with the Earth.  With some luck, Richard Brodie's  VIRUS OF THE MIND may perform the  same service for the legions of  psychologists and psychiatrists now infecting our cities like so  many  bloated cockroaches.  Brodie has [rather shamelessly] adopted Richard  Dawkins'  concept of the 'meme' to explain why so many people, confused and  distressed by today's  complex life, turn to these parasites for  enlightenment.  The reason so many of these people  end up spending  fortunes over many years 'working it out' with their therapists is that the  'advisers' have no idea what's going on either.<br />Brodie's book isn't the  definitive 'science of memetics', as some on this page have faulted him  for, nor is it intended to be.  Brodie is offering people, in plain,  unadorned language, an  opportunity for those in distress to take charge of  their own destinies.  The best aspect of this  book is that it offers a  concrete, easily understood foundation for why they feel the stress in  the  first place.  No-one can shed stress, which is often viewed as 'the devil  we know', without  adding to the condition until a new path is adopted.  Brodie makes abundantly clear how  little we need to cling to the known  devil and how pleasant a task it is to cast it off.  He's to be  congratulated, not condemned, for not writing a scientific treatise on how  memes work.  Calling this book a 'self-help' volume should be a viewed as  a compliment, not pejorative.	2000-08-22

Foretelling the future, once the realm of mystics and entrail pullers, is now  a subject of serious scientific study.  Paul and Cox offer us a  rational and  plausible scenario of what the future holds for humanity.  With  backgrounds in biology and computer engineering, they've combined to  bring competence to an enduring question: Where are we going?  You may  not  like their view of the road ahead, but it's impossible to ignore their  forecast.<br />Their arguments focus on developments in neurosciences and  computing  power.  They foresee a merger of these two disciplines resulting  in the  creation of a new humanity capable of engineering new, immortal  physical  brain carriers - bodies.  Bodies themselves, as any gene can  verify, are of  minor importance.  They are in essential agreement with  Richard Dawkins  that the selfish gene, in replicating itself, casts off  the brain/mind of its  host and losing whatever that mind has accumulated  during its life.  Their  forecast is that the brain, using cybernetic  technologies, will be able to  avoid that waste by taking control of what  DNA does during its  thoughtless replication activity.<br />This is a  momentous proposal, worthy of serious consideration.  The so- called  'moral' issues of whether humanity should engage in such activity,  aren't  shrugged off.  Paul and Cox  contend that there will be Rejectionists  who  will refused the option of cyberevolution and remain mortal.  They  suggest  the Rejectionists will remain the chief source of art, music and  other  more diverse roles in life.  We are left unclear as to how diverse the  cyberhumans will become.  The authors argue that the cyberhumans will  be  the ones to populate other planets, finding their diversity in response to  new environments.<br />The only real flaw in this book is ignoring the power  of DNA in driving  our lives and society.  Whether we will ever understand  the workings of  DNA sufficiently to actually create a wide range of  individuals remains  problematic.  The individual who first successfully  transforms into a  cyberhuman will set a pattern more likely to be repeated  than modified.  To create discrete cyber-individuals will be tremendously  resource  extravagant.  This is likely lead to a narrow range of available  DNA to  launch the cyberpopulation.  As we have already experienced with  the  shrinking gene pool of crop seeds, such a reduced variety is highly  vulnerable to virus assault.  An organism that succeeds in infecting such a  limited diversity can quickly wipe out the whole cyberhuman population.  Modifying the gene pool to resist such an infestation will take more  resources and the Rejectionists will again be successful survivors through  their genetic diversity.<br />This flaw, however powerful, doesn't detract  from the significant questions raised and developed in this compelling  book.  If you wonder about the future, if you think computers are only for  entertainment, if you think  humans are the logical end of evolution, then  buy and read this fascinating book.of  individuals remains  problematic.

Bowering, who had published  several volumes of poetry prior to this novel, has  produced here a  stunning work of prose.<br />Any study of a person's historical roots should  have universal appeal, and this one does the  job better than most.  Vancouver, like any West Coast city, has strong multi-cultural roots.  Bowering brings that phenomenon into stark focus with her account of Robert  Louis Lam's  search for his parents' histories.  His tour guide is an  astonishingly 'real' ghost; his Chinese  'grandmother' who nudges him from  one information source to another.  She gives nothing  away, but goads him  when he flags in the quest.  It's supposed to be a holiday, but Lam Fan  prods him to delve further into family records to derive the story.  As the  account unfolds,  Robert's search takes the reader into the seamier side of  West Coast life, portraying the  Chinese struggling for existence in the  face of white North American attitudes.  Robert's  mother is driven to move  adroitly between those worlds.<br />Not enough praise can accrue to Bowering  in her handling of the multitude of issues arising  from depicting the West  Coast scene at the turn of the century.  Her characters, Lam Fan in  many  ways the most vividly portrayed of them all, are skillfully drawn.  Bowering brings  Robert Lam's mother, India Thackery, into the story with  finesse, ultimately but subtly  bringing her forth as the real lead  character in a complex tale.<br />This book has appeal for a variety of  reasons.  West Coast life in the early years of the 20th  Century has been  buried under gold rushes, railroad building, and two wars which have  combined to give white North Americans a dominant voice in what is related.  Bowering has  opened new vistas for us to consider.  She's done it with a  fine sense of compassion for  human values instead of lofty, unrealistic  goals and crusades.  Life isn't experienced only by  the wealthy, white,  comfortable controllers of history.  Every major community has its  underpinnings.  Bowering's book should be restored for sale to those  wishing to learn more  about their neighbours.istic  goals and crusades.

With a clear, instructive  style, he's able to bring us an array of delightfully  informative articles.  His outspoken  opinions on most subjects deserve our  attention and ongoing reflection.  He presents  arguments well while  presenting the foundation for them with enough background to  encourage  further delving.<br />His real forte, of course, lies in redeeming  historical figures whose reputations are tarnished  or faded.  Here, he  restores such luminaries as Lavoisier, Lamarck, and Buffon, showing how  fleeting notoriety is at best.  He even dares assault the lofty peak of  Darwin.  Only a idea as  profound and modest as natural selection could  survive the passage of time and continuing  challenges.  Yet labelling  Darwin a 'dullard' seems inappropriate for the man who struggled  for a  generation to bolster his idea with available evidence.  'Dullard', after  all, is defined as  'mentally slow' and Darwin was anything but that.  Flamboyance isn't highly regarded  among the research community.  Gould's  own siege against natural selection is almost  overlooked in this  collection.  One can only wonder how he would fare solely as an historian  of science.<br />There are few flaws in this book.  The publisher might have  taken a hand and compiled a  bibliography for faster reference.  Certainly,  Gould's sales must offset the additional cost.  Gould, himself, however,  makes one peculiar omission.  He uses the term 'sound bites' in one  section and refers to 'human cultural change' as a 'powerful mechanism of  Lamarckian  cultural inheritance of acquired characters' in another.  It's  easy to visualize him with  clenched teeth, pacing before his word  processor.  'There's GOT to be a substitute for 'meme'!  Richard Dawkins'  cultural replicator is superbly described in Susan Blackmore's THE MEME  MACHINE, but Gould is unlikely to concede any point to Dawkins.<br />Given  that, Gould's writing skills and breadth of subjects makes this book a  welcome  addition to any library.  His frequent asides make delightful  reading [the reference to Amtrak  is particularly cogent], giving the  reader a pause in a sometimes intense flow of information.  The lightly  conveyed personalizations bring a fine sense of Gould's humanity to these  columns.

If not, you might start searching for your  answer here.  If you can, you might find another suggestion in this  collection of superb essays.<br />What lofty arrogance gives any of us the  presumption in offering any form of judgment of a  David Quammen book?  It  is a rare writer who comes so alive on the page for us.  More than  mere  facts are here; he brings both personal meaning and human values to their  simple  disclosure.  He seductively captures a readers' attention with an  element, then expands our  view of life as he opens horizons for us.  It's  a dull reader who comes away without reflecting  on their values.  Quammen  deftly draws the reader into his world; walking through spider- infested  forests, climbing inaccessible slopes, or scrambling about a library.  Here  is a writer  of unrivaled skill whose human values permeate every  essay.<br />This latest work is offered as the 'swan song' of his career with  Outside magazine.  It will be  lamentable if he fails to generate more  examples of his delightful and instructive prose.  He  did this with fine  proficiency in SONG OF THE DODO.  Numerous topics in this collection  lend  themselves to just such an enlargement.  How many beetle species roam our  planet with  us?  What happened to the owl's spatula?  Can a cat truly fly?  What powers are hidden in the  nutmeg in your Christmas eggnog?  Quammen  addresses such questions, but answers are not  always forthcoming.  More  work is to be done, and few, if any can accomplish it as does  Quammen.<br />Quammen has been improperly labelled a 'nature writer', a  misnomer applied to one who so  thoroughly researches his material.  He  queries field scientists, laboratory techs, the garage  operators and  himself.  A proper label would be 'science journalist' if that truly  promotes his  role.  Whatever he might lack in academic training, he more  than overcomes in the depths of  his inquiring mind.  He exhibits no limits  to his observations nor in the methods of dealing  with them.  The result  reflects the breadth of his readership - anyone will find something in  his  work.<br />We can only hope that these pages will not remain empty overlong  of new works by this  talented author.

This well conceived  and finely crafted work  should grace any library.  Bringing skillful  research and writing skills to relating the evidence  of human origins,  Leakey and Lewin demonstrate why this team has been so successful.  More  than simply technical skills are visible here.  There's a strong sense of  humanity applied  here to everything from flying an aircraft to preparing a  specimen for appraisal.  A major  element in Leakey's presentation is his  willingness to revise his opinions in the face of new  evidence<br />Leakey  once suffered from 'lack of credentials' in his work as an  paleoanthropologist.  Drawn  to this work by a fascination with our past  instead of by an academic background, he's  shamed his critics with  stunning finds, excellent logic in assessing their value, and the  presentation talents shown here.  The lack of academic constraints frees  him to bring fossils to  life in speculative scenarios no schooled  scientist would dare.  He does it here with plausible  accounts of our  ancestors possible lifestyles.  The guild scientists may complain that  'there  isn't enough evidence' to draw these scenes, but Leakey is careful  to point to the evidence,  drawing many elements together to produce these  scenes.  They are vivid and thought  provoking in portrayal and need no  more defense than that.  And they are supported by fine  illustrations of  many aspects of paleoanthropology.<br />Leakey's examination of language  development occupies a significant part of his discourse.  These arguments  are worthy of your close inspection.  Verbal communication has long been  viewed  as the sole distinction between humans and the other animals.  Leakey shows how  even this feature cannot be considered a sharp  demarcation.  He examines the function of  language over the course of  human evolution, concluding that language and our oversize  brains result  from a continuous feedback loop.<br />There are few shortcomings in this book.  Foremost is a lack of bibliography [yes, this remains  a shortcoming even  while defending Leakey's 'non-academic' background].  It would be nice  to  further pursue details of some of the contentious issues.  Lewin's own  BONES OF  CONTENTION makes a fine starting point.  It lacks however, any  mention of Owen Lovejoy's  thesis on bipedalism related in Johanson's LUCY,  the most succinct depiction of human  evolution in print.  Leakey uses  Harry Jerison as a source for brain/language interaction, but  you'll look  long to find Jerison's BRAIN SIZE AND THE EVOLUTION OF MIND.  The lack of  a reading list can be overcome with a bit of work on your part.  There are  many good titles  available and the effort will expand your view of our  origins.  Start here, you will not find  many other works that will touch  your own humanity as closely as this one does./>There are few shortcomings in this book.

He has stood on the brink of the  abyss,  confronting the Great Mystery.  It is his good fortune [and ours]  that he was able to step back and remain with us to continue exercising his  fine research and writing for our benefit.  ROCKS OF AGES is an  expression of his gratitude for the reprieve; a highly personal statement  resulting from a  crisis.  In the past, such thoughts committed to paper  usually remained in someone's journal, locked away in a drawer to be  retrieved by later generations.  Perhaps Steve Gould would have been  wiser  to follow that example.<br />This book contains so many flaws that in listing  them it's difficult to know  where to start.  Or stop.  Above all else,  it's impossible to answer the  fundamental question posed to any author:  who is this book written for?  Scientists?  Gould wants science and  religion at peace.  So which scientists  are at war with religion?  Did he  really write this book solely as an assault  on Richard Dawkins, the only  truly outspoken critic of religion in the  scientific community?  One book,  one man; a slogan reminiscent of  kamikaze pilots.<br />Is 'religion' the  target audience?  Gould takes 132 pages [of 222] to admit  he knows nothing  of Islam, Hinduism, Shinto, Aboriginal worship or other  'non-Western'  religions.  Doesn't leave much to choose from, does it?  Judeo-Christian  tradition remains the last available readership for ROCKS.  And 'Rock of  Ages' isn't a Jewish hymn.<br />By deduction then, we surmise he's addressing  Christianity in seeking a  peace.  Good luck to him.  Darwin didn't attack  religion in Origin, but the  Church put it on the Index before the ink was  dry, yearning for a pole and  some dry branches with which to 'redeem' the  author.  It was religion that  launched the war against science, not vice  versa, no matter how deviously  Gould evades that fact.  He cites the long  history of theologians dabbling  in natural phenomena as a sign of the  merger of science and religion he  seeks.  The position, like most of this  book, is false.  Like many artists and  composers of earlier days,  'scientific' theologians existed for one reason -  no-one else had access  to an education.  Even Darwin entered university  intending a  clerical  future.  If you didn't subscribe to the Thirty-Nine  Articles, you didn't  get through the porticullis.  SAT tests don't challenge  the soul.<br />So why  did Gould produce this poorly conceived volume?  In HOW WE  BELIEVE,  Gould's friend Michael Shermer gave `consolation' as the chief  reason for  Americans' adherence to christianity.  `Consolation', however,  remains a  vague term. Presumably, the root issue is what happens After?  Gould,  having faced that question, has given us this book as the result.  Never  mind all the pap about ethics and morals he drags us through.  Who  gave  Christians a monopoly over what is ethical and moral?  Or even  beautiful?<br />The real issue is the Great Mystery and how we face it.  Gould  cites Mark  Twain on comparing natural versus christian morals [the  ichneumon wasp  episode].  He should have delved more deeply into Twain,  who described  Christian mothers imparting a Moral Sense to their children  and 'soiling  their minds'.  Twain, too, considered the After, finding it  sterile, devoid of  meaning unless human values were introduced.  He  described the  dichotomy of Sheol and Paradise as `heaven for climate, hell  for society'.<br />Gould has once again handed the creationists a cudgel to  use on the  research community.  To his iconoclastic assault on Darwin's  natural  selection, he has added an apologia for religion, urging  Christians to keep  snug within their own magisterium.  Unfortunately,  Christians feel that  bailiwick includes public school boards and the tax  office.  The result will  be an enlarging of the disparity of resources  expended on church facilities  versus research institutions.  It is money  thatkeeps research going, and if  those funds are diverted into the  magisterium of religion, there will be  even less for paleontological field  research.  Snug in his office of semi- retirement, Stephen J. Gould will  not feel the loss.is money  that keeps research going, and if  those funds are diverted into the  magisterium of religion, there will be  even less for paleontological field  research.

Eldredge would have done better to end this book at the second  paragraph: &quot;Richard Dawkins must be right after all!&quot;  Unfortunately, after  making this capitulation he then turns to a pejorative, labelling Dawkins  and his [unnamed] colleagues as &quot;UltraDarwinists&quot;.  It is  difficult to  perceive how anyone can be `beyond Darwin', but Eldredge  returns  continually to the phrase.<br />For a generation, Eldredge, in  collaboration with Stephen J. Gould, has  attempted to erode Darwin's  'natural selection' mechanism of evolution.  Instead of gradual,  incremental change, they urge evolution as progressing  in fits and starts.  The idea is indirectly supported by the imperfect  sequence of the fossil  record, a point Darwin conceded in Origin of  Species.  Eldredge uses the  remainder of this book to explain why 'natural  selection' should be  replaced by 'punctuated equilibrium' - it follows the  pattern of history.  The pattern is that a traditional idea replaced by more  innovative  concepts.  The key example here is the replacement of  gradualism in  geology replaced by the more determined action of  continental drift.  Eldredge wants to replace Darwin's form of 'gradualism'  in evolution with  a Wegenerian concept in biology, punctuated  equilibrium.  This will gain  Eldredge [and, one assumes, Gould] a stature  in the history of science  equaling Wegener's.<br />Daniel C. Dennett's DARWIN'S DANGEROUS IDEA offers a  penetrating  analysis of the punctuation idea.  Illustrating the fallacies  of the thesis,  failing to provide a scale for measuring rate of species  change, for  example, Dennett's critique should have swept away any vestige  of  support for the idea.  The 'UltraDarwinists' use molecular genetics to  reinforce Darwin's original concept.  While earth's history has experienced  episodes of rapid change [a 10 km bolide provides an earthshaking [sorry!]  environmental pulse], such events are not the mechanism of evolution.<br />Eldredge's own example of the Cecropia tree, a continuing theme through  this book, is a perfect example of why Dawkins is right and Eldredge  wrong.  Cecropia's forebears adapted to the impact of increasing hurricane  frequency due to the closure of the Panamanian isthmus.  Eldredge calls  Cecropia`s emission of dormant seed pods 'cheating'.  Yet that's exactly  what Dawkins calls adaptation to environment.  How rapidly did Cecropia  `learn' this trick?  Where did it learn it?  Clearly, those trees whose  genes  contributed to seed dormancy survived to enhance the talent in later  generations.  Why Eldredge fails to examine that aspect is a mystery,  since  it is evolution's method.<br />Recommendations about this book don't  come easy.  The dispute over  `punctuated equilibria' has gone on too long.  Readers should be aware of  Eldredge's views [and cheap rhetoric], but  learn why he's wrong.  Read  this book, but don't buy it.

Ignoring that since Copernicus the role of divinities in the  cosmic picture has become  irrelevant, Clinton dragged his god into the  ceremony.  The past half millenia has  revealed a wealth of information  from galactic spectra to the operating details of life  itself.  But the  work was done by people, not some ghost.  Mark Twain railed at [g]od  coming in to claim the credit' after human research effort produced cures  for yellow fever and  other ills.  Clinton must have made the spirit of  Twain gyrate furiously when he  credited [g]od with creation, and by  default, as the cause of the structure of DNA.  With  so much knowledge of  a god's irrelevance confronting him, why did Clinton fall into  the trap of  giving credit to The Sprite?<br />Michael Shermer has made a significant  effort to detail the background thinking [or  lack of it] that sustains the  concept of The Sprite so firmly in the American psyche.  How does the idea  of a divine creator persist when the logic supporting it weakens  with  every forward stride of knowledge?  Why do so many Americans, supposedly  the most literate nation on earth, retain such adherence to superstition?  Who are the  believers and why do they believe?<br />Half a century ago,  Robert Nathan wrote a delightful social satire, DIGGING THE  WEANS.  Archeologists from a future Africa crossed the seas to learn about the  extinct people known as the US.  In particular, they sought answers to why  the US  seemed so different from other people.  One wonders what Nathan  might think today.  Since his  time `globalization' has become a  smokescreen term for Americanization.  How these new imperialists think is  a compelling issue.  Shermer's book has provided  insight to one facet of  that thinking.  It's of particular meaning to those of us living  elsewhere.  If there's a serious flaw in this book, it's a failure to make  some valid  comparisons with other people and their faiths.<br />Still,  Shermer tries valiantly to fulfill the mandate he's given himself.  How  Americans  believe is depicted by numerous quantitative studies.  How many  PhDs, bank  managers or trash collectors, burdened with fears of the  afterlife [or lack thereof] cling  to the image of The Sprite?  Shermer  can't truly extract which of these is hopeful of  something better on The  Other Side, or simply fleeing an envisioned post-perish  punishment.  We  can't blame him for this, since the faithful probably can't express,  either.<br />Shermer's attempts to provide insight into WHY so many Americans  are so persistent  in their piety fall rather flat.  The studies quoted  seemed rather simplistic, but the  question can only be, do you believe in  The Sprite, or not.  The discussions about  agnosticism, non-theist or  theist are engaging, but don't address the difficult question:  why does  the nation with the most Nobel winners remain the most superstitious?  Perhaps Shermer would have done better to simply beg off attempting the  question as  too difficult.  At least in only 290 pages.  Yet, the question  arises repeatedly.  It titles  the fourth chapter and an appendix and is  the theme of Chapter 5.  He uses it as a  subtopic and for table headings,  but we never find out why such a powerful people  need to escape reality  for the elusive solace of neo-Christianity.<br />The cure for yellow fever  [and smallpox and polio] came from science workers, not  faith[ful]  healers.  Twain wanted priority recognition for those researchers and  instead watched the credit go to [g]od.  With such a high proportion of  Americans  expressing faith, it's inevitable that even scientists will find  themselves in different  camps.  In one of the strangest sections in this  book, Shermer launches an assault on  Daniel C. Dennett's critique of  Steven J. Gould.  Gould, co-author of the`punctuated  equilibria'  mechanism of evolution, is particularly deft at disclosing Gould's mental  gymnastics in  expressing his ideas.  In this context, Gould  sells Shermer  on eschewing the term `random'  in favour of `contingency' in describing  evolution's process.  Dennett, following  Richard Dawkins, rightly sees  Gould introducing `skyhooks' in his attempts to modify  Darwin's theme of  natural selection.  Shermer is clearly unhappy at this tarnishing of his  hero,  firmly chastising Dennett at `protesting overmuch'.<br />Why does  Shermer take off on Dennett so strongly?  Is it merely because Gould  forwarded his last book?  Shermer awards Gould too much credit for giving  `contingency' a deep philosophical meaning in contrast to  `random', a  quirky and  apparently less definable term.  Gould rises in his own defence  of contingency,  wrapping the evidence in the term `sequence' in his  definition of evolution's modus  operandi.  This seems to give  `contingency' a respectability lacking in `random'.  The  presentation is  convoluted and the evidence misleading, however.  Random  necessarily  avoids sequence; otherwise it's no longer random.  Nor is contingency  sequential - unless, as in this case, evolution makes it so.  Saying  Dennett `doth protest  overmuch', Shermer ignores the stature of Gould as  America's best-known science  writer.  If Gould gets it wrong, the impact  will be widespread.

GENOME attempts to forestall such misleading media  expressions.  Ridley, a talented writer, has his work  cut out.<br />Once called 'the stupid molecule', DNA is revealing its secrets.  The exposure is due  to the work of many scientists and related to the  public by fine writers such as Ridley.  Still, we remain mostly in  darkness about the role of genes in our lives.  Media accounts  such as The  Times' bring little clarity.  The recent debate among the members of  Britain's ruling house is a more amusing, but typical, expression of this  situation.  Ignorance is a disease which no medicine relieves.  Education  is the antidote and  Ridley has provided a palatable dose in GENOME.  How  many journalists, teachers  and doctors are willing to swallow it?<br />The  medical metaphor reflects the underlying theme of GENOME.  Much genetic  research focuses on medical issues.  The biotech industry anticipates  immense profit  from therapies resulting from the completion of the Human  Genome Project.  Ridley  cites numerous cases of genes being 'identified'  with particular illnesses.  In nearly all  cases, the media trumpets the  find with stories of 'genes for [schizophrenia,  Huntington's haemophilia,  fill in your own].  The public has come to feel these  molecular strings in  their cells are hidden assassins.  The importance of reversing this  misconception leads Ridley to declare GENES ARE NOT THERE TO CAUSE DISEASE  throughout the book.  One is led to wonder which gene drives people to  write  headlines protracting the reverse view.<br />Ridley keeps a fine  balance in the 'genetic determinism' debate.  His chapter on  chromosome 10  provides a captivating account of the endless feedback loops between  genes, their structure and role, and the impact of the environment on both.  His ability  to explain why we must avoid seeking simple answers and shed  preconceptions ranks  among the best in print.  It will take an immense  amount of research and talented  scientists to trace the intricate pathways  of these elements.  As a journalist, he displays  a good talent for  explaining what is known, and what needs to be studied further.<br />His  account of the Britain's 'mad cow disease' episode is perhaps the perfect  example  of why the world needs more Matt Ridleys.  Panicky politicians,  spurred on by  'shouting media' in both this and the GM food debate,  responded hysterically to the  cost of nearly two hundred thousand cattle  and strained relations between Britain and  the European Union.  A  responsible media might have tempered this disaster.  The  public needs to  make informed decisions and it's a pity that the media continues to  ignore  the easily readable messages Ridley has provided in this book.<br />There  are really only two flaws in GENOME.  The notes need to be closer to the  text.  Page references are a start, but there's an awful lot of page  flipping to see where the  information is coming from.  The glaring blemish  is in the Index.  This book is far too  important to omit so many  references to what is in the text.  Phrase after phrase  appears, and when  wishing to review it later, discovered the term wasn't even listed.  It  is  to be hoped this was a money-saving gesture on the part of the publisher,  and not  laziness of the author.  That said, the value of the book is too  great to allow such small  faults to discourage even the most mildly  interested reader.  GENOME is about you  and me.  I've read it more than  once and discussed it with many.  Hopefully, more of  you out there will  follow that example.shed  preconceptions ranks  among the best in print.

Beyond  Humanity:CyberEvolution and Future Minds was met with a fanfare of  resounding silence.  Well done with strong evidence and good presentation,  the book challenged traditional thinking about the separation of machines  and humanity.  It should have gained greater notice than it did.  A pity,  for this book should  have raised immense discussion.<br />Now, Rudy Rucker  has turned the same ideas into a speculative fiction account of a  programmer ['hacker'] using evolutionary processes to make robotic  creatures biological.  As with all evolutionary processes, his program gets  out of hand and the creatures run amok, out of control.  Only another  robotic biological is capable of dealing with them.<br />If Rucker ever  produced 'his best book' this is the one that qualifies.  Many of his other  works are loaded with a sloppy kind of mysticism that seems horribly  inconsistent with his profession as a mathematics professor.  This book  seems to merge an audited biology course with his math skills in producing  a plausible scenario of the future.  That he makes this future so near  makes the book even more compelling.  Having railed against 'WHITE LIGHT'  and SAUCER WISDOM, it was gratifying to find a work of his that tends to  redeem his worth as a novelist.  The writing, as always, falls below the  worth of his concepts.  Still the book made an entertaining afternoon.  If  you haven't the patience or courage to confront BEYOND HUMANITY, you might  try this as an introduction to the possibilities of artificial  intelligence.	2000-06-24

As with other mystics, he wants  us to learn how to  shed our dull Earthbound bodies.  Other of his books have pursued this theme with more or less success.  This  time, Rucker uses a fresh approach in tracing possible paths technology  might takes from the material to the spiritual over the next few thousand  years.  Following Kurt Vonnegut's lead with Kilgore Trout in BREAKFAST OF  CHAMPIONS, Rucker inserts himself into the story as an interrogator and  scribe for his main character.<br />Combining his day job as a Professor of  Mathematics with his sideline as diviner of possible futures, Rucker uses  an avatar named Frank Shook.  Shook, who has learned to contact aliens, is  taken for joyrides aboard their craft. Other abductees have claimed to be  transported to  other worlds, suffering various physical indignities.  Shook's hosts turn him into a time  tourist in helping him realize  enlightenment.  Shook's task requires bringing Rucker's writing  talents  [sic] to create the book we're reading.  The future won't occur if this  book isn't written.<br />Rucker's academic credentials are displayed well as  he  takes us along humanity's timeline.  He's able to forecast where  today's knowledge and  technologies are likely to take us over the  ensuing  few thousand years.  While highly speculative, the technological forecast  has a solid base.  Biological, technical and ethical [but not moral] issues  combine to ease the human  species from its corporeal self to ultimately  achieve a union with a deity; `God'.  With a  capital `G', of course.  The  use of the Christian deity is disappointing.  There are so many  more, and  more interesting, spirits that might be invoked.  Baiame, agent of creation  with the  Australian Aborigines, has a sense of humour.  He also has longer  tenure,  predating the Christian deity by forty thousand years.  Amaterasu  from Japan has grace and charm.  A female Creator, she suits those  demanding today's political correctness.<br />The book reeks of Rucker's  personal crises.  Booze, sex, drugs and other value issues  permeate the  story.  With many hints through the narrative, Rucker finally blurts it out  near  the conclusion: &quot;I wished to remain sober.&quot;  If Rucker's  having a drinking problem, strife with  his spouse, or failing finances, he  should put these issues in a diary and publish it.  If readers care,  they'll buy and read about it.  The rest of us can spend our money on  something  pertinent.  While the ultimate future offers his 'god' as some  kind of solution, he agonizes  over the immediacy of today.  What solutions  does this god provide?  Are they valid for the  rest of us, or only for  Rucker?  He seems to cry out for answers to life's challenges, but seems  to be asking the wrong questions.  The only thing honest about all this is  he's open about his  distress.<br />In writing this book, Rucker's writing  style has sunk to a new low.  The competition for  which character, Rucker  or Shook, is the more shallow is too close to call.  He flirts with other  writers' gimmicks shamelessly.  We can't call his writing sophomoric, his  word plays would  be scorned by any freshman.  The use of the Devil's  Postpile [or Monument, depending on  your authority] from Close Encounters  of the Third Kind isn't plagiarism.  It's simply pitiful.  His bravery in  forecasting potential paths of technology doesn't make up for the  inadequacy  of how he presents the case.

The eighth is The Colour of Magic.  Like the other colours, its  intensity may be measured - using a thaumometer.<br />On our world, as Paul Quarrington  depicts here, magic is measured with a bank account book.  Its  practitioners are showmen not  wizards.  They are sleight-of-hand artists,  illusionists well versed in the motto 'the hand is quicker than the eye'.  They are highly  competitive for audiences and recognition.  The issue of  selecting routines for their performances looms large, both for the sake of  the  audience and thier competitors.<br />Performance magic relies heavily on  deception and devices.  Quarrington relates how little novelty there is in  this trickery.  Manuevers  and mechanisms are frequently handed down over  generations to apprentices or favored associates.  In The Spirit Cabinet it  is a  collection of material derived, almost inevitably, from the greatest  magical showman of them all, Henry Houdini.<br />Assembled from such diffuse  origins as Germany, Switzerland and Saskatchewan, a melange of conjurers  gathers in Las Vegas to  acquire a collection of Houdini memoribilia.  Quarrington takes great pains in demonstrating the trade draws unusual  people.  Jurgen  and Rudolfo are an unusal couple, in more ways than one.  A rarity in the craft, they are a team.  Most magicians, such as Kaz and  Preston the Adequate [his father was Preston the Magnificent] work alone,  or with no more than a decorous assistant.  All covet the  Houdini  material, although why, since so much of it has been duplicated, remains  hidden.  Jurgen and Rudolfo acquire the collection.  From that point on,  their relationship takes a new course.  A hint of real magic emerges,  confounding all their lives.<br />Quarrington has drawn these people well.  In describing their origins, there are numerous unexpected twists.  The  memory of Preston's  father overshadows his life.  Jurgen and Rudolfo have  what can only be described as bizarre childhoods.  As partners in  performance  and life, they become lovers.  Few books reach publication  these days without some form of sexual dysfunction as at least a minor  theme.  Kaz is Jewish, causing him to view every slight or competition as  anti-Semetically based.  Only Miranda seems stable; the  account of her  show business career is one of the best episodes in the book.<br />Quarrington obviously spent much effort researching this book.  Combining this information with his prose skills he restores the value  of  personal performance to a generation inundated with special effects in TV  and film.  As he did in Whale Music, he depicts the life of  entertainers.  Stage magic is not for the inept and Quarrington portrays well the stresses  these practitioners endure.

Star Trek, that manifestly American idea, proclaimed space as the  'final frontier'.  As Berger states, the North American frontier experience  was unique and permeated popular thinking.  No other culture has so  staunchly believed in the ideal of expansion into 'empty lands' and  'development' of physical resources.  However, as Berger's two part story  of  Jack Crabb reminds us, the land wasn't empty.  An indigenous population  vainly resisted European  encroachment for over two centuries.  Failure to  hold their territory left them scornfully dismissed as 'backward'.  Film,  radio, books and finally, television combined in reinforcing  the image of  'savages' being replaced by triumphant civilization.<br />Berger's Little Big  Man probably did more to disabuse the North American public of its  misconceptions of Native Americans than any other single work.  Assigning  this book to students in the 1960's resulted in shock and not infrequently,  resentment, at the distruction of closely held myths.  Berger's depiction  of the Cheyenne made them truly 'human beings', not hostile savages.  The  Washita and Sand Creek massacres were big news to students of the '60s who  ardently believed Indians 'got what they deserved' after the Little Big  Horn.<br />The Return of Little Big Man takes us beyond the slaughter at the  Greasy Grass [Little Big Horn] into that era when North America was  realizing the frontier was closing.  With the Indians driven to  reservations or into Canada, Jack finds himself moving through such  notorious sites as Dodge City, Deadwood and Tombstone.  Berger uses  Crabb's wanderings to move the focus from Native Americans to the  'gunslingers' and opportunists who provided the foundation of the frontier  myth.  Crabb encounters Hickock, Cody, the Earps and others any North  American will readily identify.  Skillfully keeping Crabb merely an  observer of the Western scene, Berger's careful research begins to peel the  patina of sanctity held by these figures for several generations.  He  condemns none, but paints them in more realistic hues, even modifying his  earlier opinion of Custer.<br />Berger employs Cody's Wild West show as a  vehicle for broadening Crabb's views of people and places.  In an era when  noveau riche Americans were taking Grand Tours of Europe, the show  paralleled those journeys while introducing an image of frontier life.  The  validity of the image is irrelevant, the show was a huge success.  Crabb  acts to typify American attitudes about Europeans.  Berger adds the Sioux  for still another viewpoint, and the visit with the Pope is a high point of  the book.  This aspect alone should give this book greater appeal with  readers in Europe.  More to the point, these same readers may finally glean  a clearer knowledge of the North American frontier.  The judas kiss given  the Native Americans by Hollywood and television will not be an easy stigma  to erase without extensive research.  Clearly, Berger has  done the  research, presenting the results in his usual lively manner.<br />There is no  doubt that The Return of Little Big Man fails to equal the novelty value of  the first volume of Crabb's biography.  While the Sioux somewhat replace  the Cheyenne of the earlier work, clearly their life has been changed by  the closing of the frontier.  The episode of Sitting Bull points up many  facets of these changes.  The focus on legendary white figures of the  post-Civil War era is extensive.  While a good background in frontier  history enhances the reading of the story, it isn't a requirement.  The  story of Jack Crabb stands quite alone in itself.scene, Berger's careful research begins to peel the  patina of sanctity held by these figures for several generations.

The  validity of the image is irrelevant, the show was a huge success.  Crabb  acts to typify American attitudes about Europeans.  Berger adds the Sioux  for still another viewpoint, and the visit with the Pope is a high point of  the book.  This aspect alone should give this book greater appeal with  readers in Europe.  More to the point, these same readers may finally glean  a clearer knowledge of the North American frontier.  The judas kiss given  the Native Americans by Hollywood and television will not be an easy stigma  to erase without extensive research.  Clearly, Berger has  done the  research, presenting the results in his usual lively manner.<br />There is no  doubt that The Return of Little Big Man fails to equal the novelty value of  the first volume of Crabb's biography.  While the Sioux somewhat replace  the Cheyenne of the earlier work, clearly their life has been changed by  the closing of the frontier.  The episode of Sitting Bull points up many  facets of these changes.     The focus on legendary white figures of the  post-Civil War era is extensive.  While a good background in frontier  history enhances the reading of the story, it isn't a requirement.  The  story of Jack Crabb stands quite alone in itself.	2000-04-02

Keneally  reminds us that the Irish Diaspora sent waves of unwilling  individuals and  families to 'new' lands in North America and Australia.  The Great Plains  of North  America remained grasslands free of the plow.  The great gold  fields of California and Australia were  some years away.  Transcontinental  railroads in Australia and North America, which would employ  many Irish  workers, were a remote dream.  Driven or transported from their failing  farms, the Irish  had little but work as farm laborers, domestic service  or, with luck, establishment as small  shopkeepers to look forward to as  they fled the Blight.<br />As a writer of many works of historical fiction,  Keneally's endowed with a superior talent for depicting  real people in  true to life situations.  He's fictionalized Australia's Patrick White,  television personality  Gordon Elliot and Aborigine rebel Jimmy Gouvernor.  Who else could successfully portray his own  and his wife's grandfathers in  fiction and history?  In Great Shame he's able to track the movements of  Hugh Larkin and other Keneally family members with his engaging writing  style.  Indeed, in telling a  story he is without peer in the English  idiom.<br />Amazon's readers will be particularly interested in this book,  particularly given the position of Irish  exiles in the Civil War.  John  Mitchell's support of slavery and the Confederacy remains enigmatic,  especially in view of England being the South's most active ally.  Meagher's role in the West and the  war is highly detailed and makes  captivating reading.<br />The real appeal of this book is not just the story  of the Irish, but the quest for justice.  The Diaspora  was driven by a  ruling nation refusing to face the realities of their inaction in the face  of all evidence.  The exiles, both forced and willing, never lost sight of  the dream of an Ireland free from the yoke of a  foreign invader.  Even  through the decades of oppression and continuing agricultural disaster,  Irishmen  sought freedom and sovereignty.  The most telling statement in  this book is found in the very last page  where Keneally reminds us that  the population of Ireland at the establishment of the Free State was  just  over half of what it had been at the onset of the Blight nearly eighty  years before.  Anyone feeling  weary from the failure to achieve a peaceful  settlement to the 'Irish question' must keep this grim  statistic in mind.  It underlies many of the attitudes held by the Irish in today's politics.  Don't buy and  read this book because you're Irish; do it to understand how  easy it is to overlook injustice and the  long term impact on its victims.<br />All this said, neither Keneally nor we submitting to these pages can  ignore the greatest injustice of  empire building - the forced displacement  or eradication of the indigenous peoples.  Keneally has  addressed that  issue elsewhere and again in his peerless style.t of  the dream of an Ireland free from the yoke of a  foreign invader.
