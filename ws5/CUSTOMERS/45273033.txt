Details, details, details. That's really what successful event planning is all about, and that's the key to this very successful event-planning manual. Author Judy Allen notes, lists, copes with and gives an example of virtually every detail in planning anything from a sedate corporate event in a major city to a huge celebration on a remote island. She provides examples galore plus tips, questions and answers, sample cost sheets and schedules. How much floor space does a person need to be comfortable in a tent? Answer: 20 square feet. How many bathrooms should be available for a party? Answer: One per 75 guests. And don't forget to ask about the stemware, adequate parking and even the photographer's back-up camera battery. This author seems to have thought every contingency, as the book's ambitious title promises. Her one glaring omission is that she does not include the party planner's fee - our guess is that she'd be worth it. We highly recommend this well-organized, very practical book to all event planners. Don't send out press releases for your party without consulting Judy Allen.	2005-10-14

First-rate historian and author Niall Ferguson offers a politically incorrect interpretation of the four-century history of the British Empire. Sure, he acknowledges that the imperialists stole, murdered and enslaved on their way to world domination. Yet, Ferguson argues, the Brits spread several traditions, including liberty, democracy and free trade, which improved the state of the world. To Ferguson's credit, he makes no attempt to gloss over the Empire's atrocities. In fact, with stellar prose, he takes the risk of undermining his central theme by describing the Empire's bad behavior in great detail. His conclusions are as complex as history itself, which might prove frustrating to readers seeking simple answers. We strongly recommend this memoir to readers who love history, and particularly to those seeking a historical perspective on the pitfalls of imperialism.	2005-10-14

When sports figures write books on leadership, they often take the easy route - athletic metaphors, game time war stories, tenuous applications of sports experiences to business. This refreshing book breaks through such superficial ideas as decisively as a dunk by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in his prime. Ten-time national champion UCLA basketball coach John Wooden - generally considered the greatest college basketball coach to ever hold a clipboard - delivers a leadership book that stands alone at center court. Remarkably, none of Wooden's players recall him urging them to win. Instead, he urged them to do their best every moment. Take care of the process, he says, and the result will take care of itself. To Wooden, preparation is pivotal and every detail matters. Despite his almost obsessive focus on getting the little things right, Wooden believes in balance and consistency. He avoids extremes. Wooden's long-time collaborator and co-author Steve Jamison does a wonderful job of portraying, through the coach, a range of qualities, philosophies and characteristics that apply to every field. We strongly recommend this book to managers and executives who want to know how to lead people to victory in every game.	2005-10-14

Krames' book adds another paragraph or two to the Jack Welch entry in the annals of business history. \\"Neutron Jack\\" kept people from getting too comfortable, once explaining that it wasn't 100,000 General Electric (GE) employees he eliminated, it was 100,000 GE positions. His radioactive personality aside, Welch had remarkable success grooming top corporate leaders. The equity value of companies run by Welch's prot&eacute;g&eacute;s - including GE, 3M, Home Depot and Honeywell - may well exceed some national budgets, so it is interesting to learn what qualities Welch encouraged as a mentor. Welch's \\"4E's\\" of leadership help explain how he generated so much value over the years for his grateful shareholders. Krames extracts leadership ideas from Welch's track record and makes them quick and handy. Although the book is more useful than original, we find that the articulation of the 4E's, and the profiles of Welch's prot&eacute;g&eacute;s make it a solid addition to any business library.	2005-10-03

Mapes's self-help book is stronger than average and includes some colorful stories from the author's life, it offers essentially predictable advice. Mapes uses the physics metaphor of quantum mechanics creatively, to show how you can make major life improvements, freeing yourself from the fear and inertia that may have held you back in the past. An actor, clinical hypnotist and corporate speaker, Mapes also includes a valuable section on how to encourage better teamwork. The material on visualization is strong, and we recommend the volume to both self-help devotees and newcomers.	2005-10-03

This book offers a refreshing voice of common sense, balance and experience. Books on this subject walk a tightrope between being too politically correct to address relevant stereotypes or, conversely, too fixated on stereotypes to transcend them. Author William Russell Melton manages the task effortlessly, thanks to his experience working in more than 20 countries. Relevant for those merely contemplating work abroad, as well as for those who just sat on their suitcases in order to zip them shut, this volume should prove to be a tremendous asset to any Yankee relocating to King Arthur's Court (or anywhere else). Melton advises Americans to be themselves, but to use common sense and show a little deference. For instance, listen more and speak less (and not so loudly, please). The author's goal is to develop confident world citizens who can interact adroitly on the world scene while staying true to their American values. The 23 pages he devotes to post-9/11 security abroad are frankly insufficient given the book's subtitle - but the quality of the information is top drawer. Melton even adds advice on how to make the transition when you return back to the U.S. We very strongly recommend that any American thinking of overseas employment should study this book - otherwise, things could get ugly.	2005-10-03

Author Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini has done a masterful job of arraying some of the most serious and most commonplace errors of judgment, estimation and deduction. The style is mostly straightforward, if academic, and makes the meat of the book's message accessible to the general reader. One quibble is that the author's explanation of certain probability calculations (especially Bayes' theorem) leaves them less clear than they could be. That aside, we give this book the highest recommendation, especially for those who like to consider how people understand their world. If you are devoted to clear thinking, you could practically use it to conduct a daily scrutiny of your mental processes - an examination of cognition similar to the monastic examination of conscience - to identify and correct any inclinations to serious cognitive sin.	2005-10-03

This volume is a compendium of chapters written by editor John Hancock and other highly regarded experts. Their clear, comprehensive book appears to be targeted to fund managers and corporate investor relations officers, more than to average green-minded investors. Don't expect passionate jeremiads on the health of Mother Earth. Indeed, the authors point to a growing scientific consensus that nuclear power is the safest way to wean the world from fossil fuels, and they insist that investments must generate profits as well as good will. This sound, useful volume will help educate investors regarding the growing significance of the SRI movement. We recommend it strongly, in part thanks to its expansive appendices detailing ethical policies, standards, definitions and performance. Some years ago, a Sesame Street social philosopher named Kermit the Frog observed, \\"It's not easy being green.\\" That may still be true, but - as this book points out - it is getting a lot more profitable.	2005-10-03

No matter what business you're in, these principles apply to your work and your life. None of them are new - honor, fairness, honesty and respect are as old as time - but this is a refresher course that reinforces what you already know about morality and ethics. Author and successful business leader Jon M. Huntsman can cite himself as living proof that you don't need to compromise your core values to become a success - or even a billionaire. If you're a leader or aspire to be a leader in any field, this quick read is well worth your time. We recommend it to help you focus on values that the modern world often tramples. The message is sweet, simple and clear: stick to your beliefs staunchly, even if it costs you in the short term, because character, integrity and long-term results are what really count.	2005-10-03

In just a few pages, authors Keith Yamashita and Sandra Spataro deliver a large dose of wisdom for individuals, teams, departments and corporations. Motivation jumps off the pages of this short, stocky book in the form of practical exercises and brainstorming sessions. The text, offered in multifont chunks with ample graphics, operates like a workbook or a workshop. It's easy to read - though the structure outlines seven key problems and then scatters their solutions. However, the book provides many real-life examples of corporate success stories and uses a minimum of New Age mumbo jumbo. What's more, it also provides a soulful look at human relations. On the downside, some of the exercises are repetitive and provoke an annoying feeling of been-there-done-that. But those instances are few and the book provides unique opportunities for personal, team and corporate development. For that reason, we recommend it to executives, fundraisers, team leaders and rank-and-file employees.	2005-10-03

If men are from Mars, mothers are from Venus and advertisers are from another galaxy altogether. Fortunately, authors Maria T. Bailey and Bonnie W. Ulman have a hot ticket for corporations that hope to rocket to the new frontiers of mother-focused sales. Backed by credible marketing data, real-life case studies and their own experiences as mothers in the world of marketing, Bailey and Ulman decipher the consumer motivations of modern moms and New Age grandmothers. They include excellent examples of successful corporate strategies and of some misdirected advertising campaigns as well, plus easy-to-understand charts, sidebars and graphics. This makes the book repetitious in parts, but still strong. We warmly recommend it to marketing, public relations, advertising and business development professionals.	2005-09-27

Becoming a successful real estate developer in New York, one of America's most difficult cities, requires laser focus and ruthless tactics. So that's what Donald Trump and, to a lesser degree his father, Fred, brought to the job as they rose to power and fame. Journalist Gwenda Blair does a masterful, thoroughly reported job of describing the various forces, conflicts of interest, power plays, politics, personalities and near-criminal behavior that resulted in three FBI investigations (but no indictments) of Trump's various real estate deals. Blair provides insights about the family relationships and friendships that shaped Trump's personality and business deals. This is a careful study of the underside of the real estate development business and what it really takes to get big projects done in complex political and financial environments. Would most corporate managers find this book useful? Certainly. We think it provides fuel for thought and a new perspective on being relentless and persistent, as well as being pretty clear about the downside of lying and of having what Donald Trump calls a \\"killer instinct.\\"	2005-09-27

This thoughtful book fills a gap in marketing literature by explaining why some unknown products and people suddenly become huge financial and popular successes. While many people assume marketers create such stars with careful planning and huge advertising campaigns, in fact many of these brands were ignored before they emerged into the mainstream. Fringe groups popularized them, created their images and made them generally successful, often with no professional involvement at all. Author Alex Wipperf&uuml;rth has done a masterful job of identifying, researching and revealing this phenomenon. In a world of repetitive marketing books, this one stands out as refreshing and insightful, complete with numerous case studies and extensive endnotes. We believe it would be a welcome addition to any marketing department's library. It can reinvigorate your creative marketing as it explains the unexpected.	2005-09-27

If you are new to the self-help genre, this book is a keeper. Put it somewhere with easy access so you can review author Nicholas Bate's main points and implement his insights. Of course, like many self-help books, this one gets redundant at times. You'll loose track of how many times Bates exhorts you to pay attention. But maybe that's the point. With a prod or two from this book, you can become alert and ready to conquer each day's challenges at work and at home. We  recommend this book to those who want to reshape their lives for satisfaction, happiness and productivity at work and at home.	2005-09-27

Most academics believe it's impossible to write intelligent books in plain language that will grab the interest of lay readers...perhaps this one will change their minds. This short book is a pleasure to read. Author and scholar Howard Gardner addresses a general readership without assuming that his readers have academic experience with psychological theories. This is a rare tome indeed - a book by a Harvard psychology don that is intelligible, elucidating and entertaining. Gardner covers all the elements of how people change their minds and couches an appeal to what he calls the \\"unschooled\\" mind. He discusses how minds change, how intelligence works and what factors influence people's thinking. Although he does not provide much tactical advice on applying his principles to be more persuasive, almost everyone can learn something new from this book, which we highly recommend. Not only could you benefit from exploring how to change people's minds, you may even change your own mind about the persuasive approaches you use every day.	2005-09-27

Management scholar Chris Argyris tackles an important problem: the pervasiveness of defensive reasoning that prevents people in organizations from understanding when and why they are skillfully incompetent. Unfortunately, he employs such an academic style that his arguments are primarily useful to fellow scholars, although they would be relevant to managers if they were offered more accessibly. The professor assumes that readers are familiar with social science literature, processes, issues and vocabulary. For those who seek solutions to the organizational problem of defensive reasoning, he offers enlightening explanatory theories, but not much practical advice. That said, it is comforting to note that someone has looked seriously at the disconnection between what executives say and what they do. Argyris catalogues the dimensions of this dysfunction and proposes - although not very concretely - that it may be open to some correction, perhaps through such tools as double-loop learning and \\"left hand/right hand\\" analysis. We suggest this book to experts in organizational behavior, corporate culture and issues in scholarship about management.	2005-09-27

You may never have given a second thought to the very existence of the Fortune 500, but author and academic Charles Perrow has. In this eye-opening sociological account, he argues that the huge organizations that dominate today's business world in the United States would have been unthinkable to the nation's Founding Fathers, who viewed centralized money and power with great suspicion. Perrow's fascinating study points out the importance of big organizations in shaping American society. Yet for all his sweeping - and well-reasoned - arguments, Perrow focuses only on a couple of diminished industries. Still, this intriguing work is an important read for responsible corporate citizens. We recommend this social history to those leaders who want American corporations to be more than profit-making machines.	2005-09-23

Authors Elizabeth Warren of Harvard Law School's faculty and her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi, a Wharton School of Business graduate, veer away from the usual save-your-pennies, clip-your-coupons genre of financial advice. They are less interested in teaching you how to pinch pennies than in showing you insightful ways to reclaim your life from your creditors and establish a sense of financial well-being. In fact, they warn that penny-pinching can be a dangerous distraction. The solution to out-of-control debt, they say, is a balanced approach, which begins by trimming the big-ticket budget busters that are devouring your income. The authors go beyond soft anecdotes and generalities to delineate specific tactics for plugging the holes in your finances, supported by diagnostic tests for readers. Occasionally their writing style is awkward - such as when they relate first-person anecdotes by specifying in parentheses which author is telling the story - but the book is otherwise lucid. The content reflects extensive, resourceful research. Best of all, the authors are realistic and don't promise any quick fixes. We strongly recommend this volume to anyone who needs financial guidance - and considering that U.S. banks alone will earn more than $100 billion this year in credit card interest, fees and other charges, that should include plenty of readers.	2005-09-15

A decade ago, economist Roger Bootle won respect for correctly predicting a long period of low inflation. In this wide-ranging look at the world economy, Bootle trades on that credibility to explain the origins of the dot-com bubble and to argue that the economy is in the midst of a housing bubble. He makes the convincing argument that stock-market gains are often little more than ephemera and he explores the idea of a knowledge-based economy. Bullish readers will be put off by Bootle's gloom and doom. Deflation has yet to occur, and the housing bubble he harps on has yet to burst in the time span since this work's publication. Still, we recommend this intriguing title to investors interested in a contrarian view of the markets and the economy.	2005-09-14

Nowadays, the phrase \\"Ponzi scheme\\" is applied to everything from putrid boiler-room operations to the housing boom. That makes it instructive to take a look at the phrase's actual namesake. Charles Ponzi was a con man, to be sure, but he also was a gifted promoter and cheerful dreamer who captured the shadiest side of the American spirit. In this fascinating, novelistic account of Ponzi's meteoric rise and inevitable fall, journalist Mitchell Zuckoff painstakingly recreates the 1920 zeitgeist that allowed Ponzi to delude and scam so many investors. Times have changed, but the underlying human nature that allowed Ponzi to raise so much cash remains the same. We recommend this page-turning history to investors who want to be equipped to spot hype and scams designed to lure the gullible.	2005-09-14

In theory and in summary, author Lynne C. Levesque's book sounds wonderful. Today's changing business environment pressures everyone to come up with creative ideas, but not everyone is creative, or so goes common thinking. Levesque argues that everyone is creative, or can be, but that there are different types of creativity. Working from a base in Jungian psychology, and writing somewhat stiffly, Levesque explains eight major types of creativity. She has clearly studied creativity thoroughly. She provides historic examples, quotations and countless tools - including an analysis of creative personality strengths based on the Myers-Brig Type Indicator - to support her thesis that minds work in different ways. Unfortunately, she gives little evidence that people become more creative when they follow her suggestions, and that's the rub. Her specific suggestions sound great, but idealistic: how many organizations have the resources to assemble teams with complementary creativity styles? As a result, we recommend this book to two groups of readers who may have the knowledge to get the most from it: those who welcome the theoretical discussion as well as the practical suggestions, and those who are devoted to fostering creativity.	2005-09-14

Leaders of established companies are now finding it harder to earn additional revenue. Authors Adrian Slywotzky and Richard Wise say managers must realize that the old reliable revenue sources - brand extensions, mergers, international growth - just aren't panaceas any more. The answer, they say, is \\"demand innovation.\\" That means proactively making business more efficient for your suppliers upstream and your customers downstream. The authors bolster their argument with detailed, relevant case studies involving the likes of Cardinal Health, GM's OnStar, Virgin, Johnson Controls and many more. The case studies mostly manage to avoid the breathy, laudatory treatment that is virtually de rigueur when consultants write about their corporate subjects. The authors' \\"invisible balance sheet\\" concept is useful. They also provide seven immediate steps companies can take to improve earnings, even if they can't create fresh revenue streams. Because this book offers practical applications, as well as theoretical strategic insights, we recommends it to managers in established companies.	2005-09-13

In this much needed update and \\"substantial revision\\" of her prior work, `Management Consultancy in the 21st Century', she limns a convincing portrait of how the e-business earthquake has forever changed the consulting industry. Czerniawska based this book, in part, on a series of in-depth interviews with leading consultants, and she includes transcripts of those conversations as part of the book. Her narrative warns that the consulting industry is splitting into two camps: proposition developers and process experts. She outlines the changes in relationships between clients and consultants that this split is going to cause. Will the pace of change in e-business consulting slow down now that the dot.com bubble has burst? Czerniawska says \\"no.\\" We believe her book is a must-read for any consultant who wants to stay ahead. Read it, and maybe you won't need to hire a consultant to keep you on track.	2005-09-13

As a middle manager, you have trouble figuring out what the boss wants. You seem to fight too much with your spouse. If any of these examples are familiar, you need to learn how to tame the \\"lions\\" in your life. Using analogies from training actual lions in the circus ring, author Steven L. Katz shows you how to work with human lions - people who demand dominance and control - from a bossy supervisor to a stubborn spouse. This is intended to be a textbook for the study of human psychology and interaction. Though you might wish it were a little deeper, the jungle beast analogy keeps it interesting. We recommend it to those who want to learn how to stand their ground in business, politics or modern day culture.	2005-09-13

Addison Wiggin is a modern Jeremiah, warning that the U. S. economic sky is falling. Apparently the market for bad news is thriving. His `Daily Reckoning' newsletter boasts half a million subscribers and his prior work, `Financial Reckoning Day', was an international bestseller. Although one might quibble with the repetitious, even querulous tone of his narrative - okay, we've got it already, the U.S. economy's a mess - it's pretty tough to dispute Wiggin's facts. The double-whammy of huge trade deficits combined with a colossal budget deficit has put the U.S. economy on such perilous footing that only a series of Federal Reserve Board-engineered investment bubbles, combined with runaway consumer spending, has kept it from falling like a muffed souffl&eacute;. The only flaw in his logic is history itself. Someone apparently forgot to inform the Americans that their economy is supposed to be failing. Their \\"naïve\\" energy, ambition and optimism continue unabated. We strongly recommend this gothic economic treatise, if only because history also suggests that even a great party can't last forever.	2005-09-08

The mere mention of \\"high-pressure sales tactics\\" makes most sales managers cringe. But the problem, says veteran salesman and author Robert L. Shook, isn't that salespeople are using such tactics, but that they are using them incorrectly. Legions of sales professionals have learned to back away from tough and aggressive techniques that work. In fact, if you use hardball techniques properly, your prospects will never know. Shook suggests that the \\"relationship selling\\" pendulum has now swung so far in one direction that it's hurting sales. Unless you give your prospect the motivation to buy, you'll leave the office with a smile but without a check. Shook believes in keeping the upper hand, guiding the client along and not backing down an inch when it comes to facing \\"not now\\" excuses. As his many colorful sales anecdotes suggest, you can't deny the effectiveness of a strong approach when it comes to closing the deal. How much you like this book, however, will probably depend on how much you hate pushy salespeople. That said, we find that the book is full of good ideas. And if you don't snap it up soon you may miss your only opportunity...well, you know the rest.	2005-09-08

Some senior executives are so eager for growth that they gamble their company's riches on new business initiatives that will probably fail. Researchers estimate that the failure rate for company-spawned business initiatives is as high as 99%. Authors Andrew Campbell and Robert Park tell companies to be selective about which growth opportunities they pursue - even if that means standing pat and accepting low growth. Growth, they say, is simply not possible at all times for all companies. They provide valuable tools, including a \\"traffic light\\" evaluation filter and a \\"confidence check\\" mechanism, to help you choose and execute new business endeavors. Wall Street has almost no greater profanity than \\"low growth,\\" but if you take seriously your fiduciary duty to spend shareholders' dollars wisely, we think you should read this book. In the aftermath of the dot-com crash and the subsequent corporate-governance scandals, the time has come for a sober, systematic approach to growth.	2005-09-08

Author Richard Gilly Nixon has revised Joe Karbo's original classic, `The Lazy Man's Way to Riches'. Karbo, an entrepreneur who stood publishing on its head by selling more than four million copies of his book, believed that most people hypnotize themselves into failure with disparaging internal monologues and defeatist attitudes. So, he developed exercises to help you alter negative scripts and attain your objectives. Nixon extends Karbo's idea that prosperity means more than adding zeros to the total in your bank account. True wealth, Nixon maintains, comes from understanding your purpose in life and pursuing it with all your heart. Many books advise you to think positively and to bolster your self-image, but they fail to tell you how. This book, with its binder-sized format, wide margins and 54 brief chapters, invites you to start a self-reclamation project. In case you wonder where to begin, its 11 solid chapters on Internet marketing will help you channel the wellsprings of motivation that emerge as you read. Although you've heard some of this advice before from Dr. Phil and his ilk, Nixon's book will move you to take action, and for that, we recommend it to restless entrepreneurial souls. Have confidence.	2005-09-08

When companies implement Customer Relationship Management (CRM), they often find that their number of complaints shoots up. Berndt Stauss and Wolfgang Seidel candidly explain that often, companies actively discourage complaints with processes that are so barrier-ridden that consumers switch to another company's products rather than negotiate the maze. As an alternative, Stauss and Seidel present a CRM-based complaint management system that, for enlightened corporate citizens, can become a strategic asset and even an indirect revenue source. Occasionally, they get a little carried away with their \\"consultantese\\" and terms like \\"process owner\\" and \\"complaint owner.\\" Nevertheless, the seven-page complaint-management checklist at the end of the book is particularly valuable. We strongly recommend this book to CRM managers who want to know what their customers really think.	2005-09-08

You rarely find a good advice book for directors, since publishers presumably believe that its audience would be small and that, in any case, those sitting on corporate boards ought to know what they are doing. But as the infamous debacles at Enron, Tyco, HealthSouth and other companies show, this isn't always the case. getAbstract.com heartily recommends this book to all corporate board members, even those with long experience. Patrick Dunne provides a useful decision-making framework for resolving common problems. It is enhanced by behind-the-scenes case studies that depict a variety of difficult company decisions and how board members arrived at them - helpful for those facing similar crises. After reading this book, you will have only one dilemma left: deciding which of Dunne's solutions to try first.	2005-09-07

Coca-Cola is the world's most famous brand, but reaching that pinnacle wasn't easy. Leading the globe in a commodity product requires exceptionally hard selling, negotiating and tough leadership. Coca-Cola hit those marks by turning its sales operation into a mission: make Coke the most popular soft drink in the world. Author Constance L. Hays tells Coca-Cola's story with exactitude. As a reporter, she is good at mixing gallons of detail with individual stories and anecdotes, even if they make the book seem long. This makes her chronology a bit slow and disjointed, because she does not hesitate to explore intriguing tangents - such as the history of the cold soda vending machine - whether or not they deflect her momentum. This calculated trade-off, which many readers will appreciate, happens particularly when she recounts the company's actions against its bottlers and describes its marketing. The book captures an important sales story about a global marketing powerhouse that fought for shelf space and control of its bottling plants at any cost, and about the men in charge. We recommend these hard insights into the business of soft drinks to strategists and sales executives...it makes for an interesting brew.	2005-09-06

Investment pro Michael J. Panzner offers an insider's guide to Wall Street that will appeal to investors on several levels. He starts with easy-to-comprehend definitions of stock market terms such as \\"short-selling\\" and \\"equity-derivative products,\\" and advances to more sophisticated concepts. With his down-to-earth approach, he demystifies the jargon, hype and superfluous data. What's more, he provides an excellent account of the historical factors and recent innovations that have altered global finance. His \\"10 laws of the new investment universe\\" are useful and comprehensive. Unfortunately, Panzner tends to glorify the past, glossing over well-documented foibles to focus on modern sins. Still, he provides a frank and insightful view of Wall Street's seductive lure. We recommend this book to investors who want to understand today's market.	2005-09-06

This is a highly specialized guidebook for market researchers. Author Ian Brace goes into great detail about designing questionnaires, a process which may seem simple, but is not. Brace thoughtfully considers the variables that can arise in all aspects of planning, structuring, writing and asking survey questions, including how to avoid ambiguity and how the actual questionnaire should look. He hews tightly to the task of getting researchers to formulate the best survey tools possible, even recommending the best type sizes and layouts. This book is only for serious market researchers, who will welcome its enclosed compact disc containing sample questionnaires and designs. In a day when many researchers use time-tested canned questions, this is a craftsman's handbook on the inside art of drafting a questionnaire. We recommend using this authoritative manual to develop your market research questionnaires. And, if you hire someone to design a questionnaire for you, this will give you some background so you can monitor the content intelligently. In questionnaire design - and supervision - apparently the really dumb question is the one you didn't ask.	2005-09-05

Refreshingly, this book deals with grass roots activist campaigns, as opposed to conventional corporate marketing. However, the impassioned amateurs it intends to teach may need persistence to penetrate its meandering organizational structure, which is perhaps more hampered than helped by the \\"100 steps\\" format. Author Chris Rose offers solid information on organizing campaigns and on communication strategies, but clustering it more tightly might have provided greater utility. Rose, a veteran Greenpeace activist, offers excellent examples from environmental campaigns. Given his expertise, that is understandably the main issue discussed in the book. The information on media management is likewise solid, if somewhat general for today's diverse media market, particularly in listing media likes and dislikes. The marketing information is appropriately geared for beginners, except for the complex diagrams on motivational characteristics and issue mapping. If you seek inspiration and concrete tactics for transforming your ideas into action and public policy, we find that this manual is a good place to start.	2005-09-02

Agreeing with author Richard Koch, you might say 20% of the statements in this book produce 80% of its value. Koch says he wrote this book because his last one, `The 80/20 Principle,' was too complex for some readers. As a result, Koch's writing, which is straightforward and concrete, at times borders on the simplistic. He illustrates each point with interesting stories and examples, some of which seem elementary to the point of being silly. That said, Koch's application of Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto's classic 80/20 rule is very useful. The modern interpretation of Pareto's law holds that 80% of your productivity stems from 20% of your activities - do more of these meaningful things, and less of the others, and you can actually become more productive while decreasing your workload. This is a valuable concept for busy people who want to be more productive while also reducing their stress. Koch's emphasis on flow, simplicity and following your passion are also useful. Some parts of the book reflect mainstream self-help literature - don't be surprised if you've heard some of it before. Koch includes worksheets to help you apply the 80/20 principle to your life. We recommend this book as a good introduction for self-help readers and those looking to do more with less.	2005-09-02

Kennedy's assassination, many people have forgotten how far American politicians have come in their public personas. Every candidate tries to use the media, savvy advisers, staged events and a winning personality to develop an authentic, vote-getting public voice. Kennedy was the first president to master these essential political tools. This made him one of America's most popular presidents, as well as a celebrity. Kennedy's political personality was so strong that it virtually transformed the presidency. In this rich historical and personal story, author John A. Barnes does a great job of showing how Kennedy operated. JFK was enmeshed in pivotal events and each circumstance tested his ability to lead. Barnes clearly presents Kennedy's triumphs and shortcomings as well as his formula for successful leadership. We recommend this to aspiring and current leaders, and to those interested in history - or in politics the way it used to be.	2005-08-31

Author Rick Barrera presents a credible, reasonably creative perspective on how your business can distinguish itself in a market that is saturated with advertising. The fastest-growing firms, he says, have learned to generate massive consumer buzz by making bountiful promises about their products and then overdelivering on those promises. Do that, he says, and you'll generate a wealth of free promotion as consumers talk with their friends and refer them to you. Barrera's \\"TouchPoint\\" system is a useful way to articulate standard business fundamentals that, properly executed, add up to strong customer satisfaction. Although Barrera uses some very good case studies, a few of them are probably a stretch. For instance, the average manager may not learn many lessons from the Blue Man entertainment group. Overall, however, we find that this book and its accompanying CD-ROM are useful references for executives and managers who are responsible for branding and strategic product positioning.	2005-08-31

Rarely does a revolutionary write the history of his own revolt. However, that's exactly what John Adair does in this book. Adair is respected internationally in the field of leadership. His 1968 classic, `Training for Leadership', was a pioneering volume on leadership development. Although his work initially received relatively little attention in the U.S., it contributed to the current \\"leadership revolution,\\" which has had a powerful impact on how companies train leaders. Today, in part thanks to Adair and others like him, companies no longer assume that \\"you either have it or you don't\\" when it comes to leadership potential. They are more willing to accept the idea that managers can be leaders, too, and should be trained for that role. Adair's book doesn't just peer in the rearview mirror of history - it casts a steady, discerning gaze at the road ahead as well. Using elegant, thoughtful prose enhanced with apt anecdotes and quotations, Adair establishes seven key principles of leadership development. His intriguing conclusion: while companies may mold the raw material of leadership, only societies and families can actually provide it. If \\"lead, follow or get out of the way\\" is your motto, we say have confidence - John Adair is marching to his rightful place at the head of the leadership pack. A must read.	2005-08-30

This admiring biography of real estate billionaire Donald Trump begins with a reference to Trump's \\"swept-back blonde mane\\" - although his thinning forward comb-over is probably the most famous weird hairdo in America. Perhaps author Robert Slater picked up a bit of his subject's tendency toward what Trump calls \\"truthful hyperbole.\\" Slater's writing is interesting and accessible, in a breathless sort of way. However, despite being based on 150 interviews, this biography doesn't contain a lot of information that Trump has not already disseminated through his books, TV show and softball press interviews. Slater seems to regard Trump's exaggerations as charming foibles and, given tremendous access, apparently accepts Trump's self-assessment that he is a skilled negotiator, shrewd investor and efficient administrator - even when the author's own anecdotes show Trump in another guise: as a bullying micro-manager. Of course, the insight that negative publicity isn't always a bad thing is a primary theme. We recommend this close-up meeting with Trump to general readers who find that his outsized ego, lifestyle and accomplishments hold a certain fascination and to businesspeople who just want to know how he always lands on his feet. (Hint: he delivers the goods.)	2005-08-29

Authors Michael J. Silverstein and Neil Fiske offer a fascinating look at the upscaling of the American consumer. American buyers were once considered relatively unsophisticated, unable to distinguish foie gras from liver pat&eacute;. Several factors changed that: globalization, greater net worth due to rising home values, increased travel abroad and the growing influence of the independent female wage earner. Backed by a massive consumer survey, the authors detail these trends to explain consumers' motivations for buying everything from $300,000 automobiles to $5 cups of designer coffee. They find that consumers will cut their budgets in some areas so they can \\"rocket\\" up their purchases of luxury brands in other areas. Perhaps most importantly, they explain why your company must avoid getting trapped between the \\"New Luxury\\" providers and the bargain-basement wholesalers. We strongly recommend this book to sales strategists, marketers, product developers and executives seeking to trade up to a more profitable position in the marketplace.	2005-08-29

Like many busy people who need to absorb or teach information in a hurry, Stephan Schiffman never met a bullet point he didn't like. Indeed, his staccato chapters depend on them like a fast food meal needs quick hits of French fries. You probably couldn't present a comprehensive sales training course without mentioning Schiffman, who's been a high-profile sales training leader for more than 20 years. Although his advice is as sound as ever, this book has an episodic structure that seems jumpy. However, the book is written for busy sales professionals, and Schiffman's first rule of sales is to know your audience. Sales executives and business travelers will find this an easy, useful read. Because of its business relevance, we heartily recommend this book to trainers, sales managers and those on the front lines looking for ways to make the most of every deal.	2005-08-26

Anyone who wants to grow and improve can benefit from reading John Eliot's book, which teaches you how to develop the power of focused thinking and, thus, to develop yourself in whatever you do. Eliot explains how to use focus to become an exceptional thinker and performer so you can achieve extraordinary things. He believes in following your passion, learning to live in the moment and incorporating some fun into your life and your job. These concepts can help anyone perform better, but they particularly call to those who want to transcend being \\"average\\" and to live with passion and purpose. Eliot explains that the human body is physiologically designed to perform exceptionally well under stress. Therefore, he says, don't focus on eliminating stress from your life. Instead, make good use of it. Although Eliot uses numerous examples from sports to illustrate his fundamental principles, readers without a great interest in athletics will still find his stories very interesting, applicable and helpful. Even if this sensible self-help book contradicts some popular self-perfecting advice, it provides a strategy for putting your passions and mental powers to work. We recommend it to those who lead stressful lives - here's how to make stress work for you.	2005-08-26

Beverly Kaye and Sharon Jordan-Evans have written a useful book for employees who are tempted by greener pastures. The authors caution that those who pursue a glittering opportunity often wind up in a golden mess. Thus, it makes sense to at least try to improve your job before seeking another one that, ultimately, may be even worse. The book's format offers one item of advice for each letter of the alphabet. At times, the formula wears a bit thin (X for \\"X-ers and Other Generations\\"), but the advice itself is sound. It primarily consists of encouraging you to decide what you want and go get it. We recommend this book to currently employed malcontents (you know who you are!) and to those who need help mustering the nerve to discuss job satisfaction with their employers. Perhaps the best piece of advice is to only approach your supervisors for a favor when you understand their WIIFT: \\"What's In It For Them.\\"	2005-08-25

Chuck Martin has written a straightforward book predominantly based upon data gathered by his company, NFI Research, in two years of research involving 2,000 managers and executives worldwide. The business world portrait he paints isn't rosy: companies continually ask managers to do more with less. Most managers and executives work more than 50 hours a week, and the marketplace constantly heats up the pressure to perform better. Under such difficult circumstances, Martin advises managers to get tough by exercising a solid set of seven specific skills. Ironically the list ends with, \\"Don't be a tough guy,\\" meaning that stressed-out managers should strive for work-life balance. The book would be even stronger if it cited prior work on the pros and cons of being tough in the workplace. Douglas McGregor's Theory X and Y, and William Ouchi's subsequent Theory Z are two classics that come to mind. We find that this book provides useful - albeit bleak - insights into contemporary corporate management, and recommend its sound advice to managers.	2005-08-25

This book maintains that morality is a sure route to management success and, implicitly, to riches. Authors Doug Lennick and Fred Kiel use stories and examples to support their explanation of the role of moral intelligence in business. They provide an abundance of anecdotes in a style that will be familiar to readers of the \\"Chicken Soup\\" series, while conveying a serious management message, if sometimes vaguely. A leader needs a moral compass to steer an organization; it is as necessary as a budget and a business plan. To evaluate your standing, see the appendix for useful questionnaires and forms. We recommend this book to those who are interested in applying their moral values to their work. If you are a person of integrity, honor and good character, you will find that this book is a practical affirmation that these sterling traits are essential in business. And if you are not such a person, well, you may need it even more.	2005-08-24

While the metaphorical sports set-up is appealing, this \\"playbook\\" about marketing relies very little on the substance of sports and even less on the more powerful forces behind marketing. Instead, John Zagula and Richard Tong have written a clever grouping of five different marketing strategies, explained with sports metaphors. Real-life strategic examples and assessments of related risks and rewards accompany each play. Using some repetition to emphasize their lessons, the authors explain which market conditions call for using each of the five strategies. They demonstrate how forces in the market make some plays more feasible, although some of the illustrative stories seem a bit forced into fitting the marketing move under discussion and some examples lack sufficient detail to let the reader align the plays with precise goals and market conditions. However, the stories and strategies all have that insider flavor, right from the coach. We believe marketers who are still learning the ropes will want this strategic playbook.	2005-08-24

Though unabashedly adulatory, this unauthorized biography of Steven Jobs - co-founder of Apple Computers and head of Pixar Studios - shows how he nearly squandered his career and fortune on ill-conceived and badly managed ventures. The writing is savvy and lively - if not always chronologically linear. The pace is quick and even readers with scant interest in computers, technology or animated movies will find the tale entertaining. Authors Jeffrey S. Young and William L. Simon wisely focus on how Jobs learned from his failures and became a success again by recognizing his own limitations. In that respect, we believe Jobs' journey holds important business and life lessons, and recommend it highly to all business readers.	2005-08-23

Long before \\"You're fired!\\" entered the popular lexicon, \\"The Donald\\" was piecing together deals that changed Manhattan's skyline. The book includes a diary of Trump's typical week. He flirts with a hostile takeover of Holiday Inn (which nets him tens of millions of dollars), has a friendly conversation with radio personality Don Imus, selects Christmas decorations for the Trump Tower atrium, chats with NBC executives, talks with Ivan Boesky just two weeks before Boesky pleads guilty to insider trading, meets with a top New York banker who begs him for his business, has a conversation with Missouri senator John Danforth and speaks with international designer Calvin Klein - all by Tuesday. If you conclude that Trump is a self-promoting, silver-spooned name-dropper, take your shirt off now and hand it to him - before he tears it off your back. Trump plays for keeps. Tony Schwarz has done his usual masterful job of co-authoring this book. (If nicely spun anecdotes could be used as collateral, Schwarz could be a real estate magnate himself.) Of course, some of the less rosy chapters in Trump's career are downplayed, and his major bankruptcy problems (and bounce back) happened after this book's initial publication. We strongly recommend it to anyone who wants an entertaining look at some of the actual reality show behind Donald Trump's towering success.	2005-08-22

Author Scott Snair got admitted to West Point Military Academy, the U.S. Army's elite university, the hard way: rising through the enlisted ranks until he was almost too old to qualify for admission. He rose to become the president of his graduating class. Because he is a Desert Storm veteran, Snair's sincerity is beyond question. His book, if not distinctive, is as solid as the paint job on an M1-A1 Abrams tank and rolls sturdily through a market filled with books that extend the military leadership model into the realm of business. Although Snair's efforts to apply military lessons to business situations seem strained, his anecdotes are interesting and his principles are rock-solid and time-tested. He believes in establishing your leadership chops by seeking additional responsibility, and in fulfilling your commitments with honor and integrity. We salute that and agree that his book will help you be a better leader. Professionals with an interest in the military will find it particularly engaging.	2005-08-22

If this book were a Donald Trump building, it would have a bright central atrium and lots of interesting side chambers for wandering. The main lobby is Trump's charm and fabulous lifestyle, but the hallways wander into very practical and sometimes dull areas where ¬- although it is quite nice to have a billionaire's advice - your garden variety millionaire could probably fill you in: how to rent an apartment, how to find an attorney, how to monitor your finances and so forth. However, even billionaires have to start someplace, and this breezy volume gives a glimpse of Trump's foundations, as well as his fame and charisma. We like the mix of practical advice with flashes of the billionaire lifestyle. For instance, one of the book's strongest features is a diary-style account of a typical week in the author's life, with his usual bevy of rich celebrities and corporate power brokers. After that, who wouldn't want to be a billionaire?	2005-08-22

Recommendation Eric Liu is a gifted, practiced writer whose prose shines, particularly when he writes about his life. This book chronicles his quest to learn what makes someone a great mentor. Quest genre sagas share lessons learned along the course of the journey, and usually culminate with some variation of Judy Garland's parting words in 'The Wizard of Oz': \\"...if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again, I won't look any further than my own back yard. Because if it isn't there, I never really lost it to begin with!\\" Liu's verbal gifts and originality enable him to avoid most, but not all, of this New Age genre's pitfalls. Liu discovers the five characteristics of great teachers, as personified by the 15 delightfully diverse mentors he interviewed: a sought-after Hollywood acting instructor, a major league pitching coach, a forensics teacher, a corporate motivational speaker and more. Liu approaches each mentor with reverent inspection, as if each unknowingly possesses a clue to the puzzle of what makes a teacher extraordinary. While the book's business relevance may be somewhat limited, Liu's essay-stories are consistently original, thoughtful and engaging. That's why we give this book a strong recommendation, particularly for coaches and trainers.	2005-08-19

Jim Rogers' book is surprisingly similar in tone to those breathless radio ads inviting you to \\"invest now\\" in petroleum futures because bad weather in the northeast is sure to cause a shortage of heating oil. But, Rogers backs up his enthusiasm - dare one say exuberance? - with facts. His record as co-founder of the Quantum Fund speaks for itself. Of course, it doesn't take an advanced degree to figure out that as China continues its inevitable lumbering jog toward economic hegemony, its appetite for commodities will become insatiable. Hearing it from someone with Rogers' track record, however, gives it immediacy. Rogers seems to be talking to the general investing public, which may explain the awkward chapters that detour through commodity investment basics, but he heads for more advanced territory soon enough. As the founder of the \\"The Rogers Raw Materials Index Fund,\\" he would probably relish a run on commodities. That said, Rogers makes a convincing case, and we strongly recommend his book to those looking to diversify into commodities.	2005-08-19

Carbone gives you a close-up look at the business of customer satisfaction. From Howard Johnson to Starbucks, the author provides you-are-there clues about the customer marketing strategies that have fueled high-profile successes and caused major failures. Reading this book is like eavesdropping on top executives. The author enhances corporate scenarios with helpful charts and timelines that apply to all businesses, from mom-and-pop enterprises to major conglomerates. The text is occasionally repetitive, but that drives home important points. We recommend this solid marketing tool to business owners and managers.	2005-08-17

The title of this 30-year history of the RE/MAX real estate firm is founder Dave Liniger's corporate philosophy: \\"Everybody wins.\\" Liniger is a maverick, so even this authorized history is exciting and instructive. Authors Phil Harkins and Keith Hollihan assert that RE/MAX, \\"never experienced a month of negative growth,\\" although they include sagas of near bankruptcies and other crises. The book focuses on absorbing storytelling, not statistics or metrics. It is organized mostly by theme, which blurs the chronology. The authors spin or dismiss any Liniger missteps, such as his \\"naïve\\" failure to keep up with payroll taxes. They praise him as bold and risk-taking, including the quixotic year he devoted to trying to fly a hot air balloon - the RE/MAX symbol - into the stratosphere. The book is readable, although sometimes a bit sweet and simple. And, the authors love clich&eacute;s (\\"He put his head down and threw himself into the job\\" - ouch). Nevertheless, we cheerfully recommend this peppy saga. Managers will find it refreshing and instructive to read about people who attribute their success to loyalty, collegiality, hands-on leadership, and the ability to work and play hard, from each agent's office to the golf course and the boardroom.	2005-08-17

Stewart paints a portrait of Michael Eisner that has more in common with a totalitarian dictator than with most CEOs. Stewart is careful, though, to trace the Walt Disney Company's growth and success under Eisner, even though he was really running Disney for the benefit of just a handful of people - including himself. And, just as carefully, Stewart traces the company's spiraling internal chaos. The pluses: the author tells an instructive, intricate corporate saga in intriguing detail. Minuses: He is no expert on the film industry and the narrative doesn't build much momentum. Frustratingly, although no doubt for sound reportorial reasons, he also mostly refuses to draw conclusions until the short final chapter. We recommend this troubling portrait of corporate excess and misbehavior to all managers and to students of entertainment and media as a lesson on the pitfalls of untamed corporate politics and unbridled CEO power.	2005-08-11

This is a book of excellent insight and originality that will be accessible primarily to scholars. Authors and economists Bruno S. Frey and Alois Stutzer explore the uncharted terrain of happiness. They teach that happiness is fundamental to economics, although economists disagree about what happiness is and how to measure it. The authors emphasize the importance of intangible, subjective factors in happiness, and bring a good deal of psychological research into the discussion of how economic circumstances affect happiness. They offer surprising evidence and conclusions, such as the facts that the old and the young are almost equally happy, and that a rising income ceases to increase happiness after clearing a relatively low hurdle. We recommend this book to the advanced specialists on economics and psychology for whom it was written, with the caveat that its dry academic style will not bring happiness to the intrigued but nonexpert reader.	2005-08-11

This book provides an elementary introduction to the way the mind works, but it is an entirely practical introduction. Authors Yoram (Jerry) Wind and Colin Crook tell readers the basics of mental functioning in order to warn them about putting too much trust in what seems to be. What we see is, in fact, not reality but rather mental models that we ourselves construct. When we understand this, we begin to see why it is important to test our mental models continuously for relevance to reality, and to change them. The authors address the impact of mental models on everything from business to personal health, using strong case histories (such as Oprah Winfrey's life changing story) as illustrations. As a lagniappe, the publisher includes a CD with a brief summary of the book's main points.We recommend this straightforward exposition; it will help you think about how you think.	2005-08-11

Public speaking is considered one of the most threatening situations you can face in your job. Answering follow-up questions can be even more terrifying. Author Jerry Weissman, an experienced presentation coach, has written a short book to teach presenters specifically how to field tough, even hostile, questions without losing control. Using actual transcripts from presidential debates and press conferences, Weissman dissects the professionals' answers to show how their responses succeeded or failed. This interesting technique provides Weissman with the material to introduce his straightforward response technique. With some practice, even the most timid presenter should gain some confidence. So without waiting for you to ask any tough questions, we find this little book helpful for CEOs, executives and managers who face tough questions from analysts, regulators, investors, competitors or the press. You'll discover it's not so much the answer you give that really matters, but how you give it.	2005-08-09

Prahalad's excellent book suggests replacing traditional notions of government-channeled aid with a new model for relieving poverty and stimulating development. The new model relies on profit-making businesses, especially multinational corporations (MNCs). The MNCs have an economic incentive to tap the great market that exists, all but hidden, at the bottom of the economic pyramid. The author demonstrates clearly that it is possible to develop business models that allow the poorest of the poor to participate actively in their own economic development by becoming entrepreneurs. Although the individuals at the bottom of the pyramid (referred to as BOP) have little money, collectively they represent a vast pool of purchasing power. They welcome opportunities to escape their oppressive burdens, including predatory intermediaries, corrupt governments and the societal \\"poverty penalty\\" that requires them to pay more than the rich for similar services. Clearly written, well documented and furnished with an abundance of anecdotes, this book is a must-read both for those interested in alleviating poverty and for those looking to tap a vast new market for consumer goods.	2005-08-05

Huselid and Dave Ulrich teach human resources (HR) executives that everything their departments do can influence their companies' profits - but not just in terms of their administrative actions. HR can have a meaningful impact on the corporation by developing employees' in-depth awareness of the business, studying the drivers that generate the employee behaviors that move the company's strategy forward and establishing a new core competency model for HR professionals. We strongly recommend this book as essential for HR executives - and as an illuminating text for other corporate leaders, right up to CEOs. While your company's HR department may already measure performance, chances are those measurements don't evaluate the real dollars-and-cents impact on the bottom line. In fact, this book shows how to determine what to measure with your HR Scorecard, how to measure it and how to report back in fiscal terms that upper management can appreciate. This is an affirmation and a roadmap for everyone who ever wanted to prove that HR, strategically deployed, can significantly influence a company's performance and profitability.	2005-08-05

Many books about negotiation are available and they offer many different kinds of advice. This guide takes a slightly different approach. It begins by emphasizing advance preparation. Author Grande Lum contends that the best way to approach a negotiation is to think about ways to help your counterparty reach his or her objectives. That said, the author also admits that many counterparties will be difficult, and may have irrational or emotional needs that make the negotiation more challenging than it needs to be. We find that this book offers sound advice for dealing with a range of negotiation scenarios. Neophyte negotiators will benefit from reading it, and even \\"old-dog\\" negotiators may learn a new trick or two.	2005-08-04

Former Harvard University President Derek Bok warns that making commercial ventures part of the fabric of U.S. higher education endangers universities' basic values and goals. However, he also gives compelling descriptions of why trustees and administrators are tempted to sign deals with corporations. He is realistic about the slim prospects for keeping such ventures away, especially since some - like sports teams - are already entrenched. Because Bok's analysis is so deeply rooted in his years of experience leading Harvard, his proposed guidelines for how and when to allow big business on campus are particularly helpful. His views are occasionally unwarrantedly sunny, such as when he avers that faculty members rarely guide students into work that promotes the teacher's financial gain. He also asserts that faculty must be wary of collaborating with pharmaceutical companies to get access to facilities and materials, even though funding unfettered research has become increasingly difficult. Furthermore, after asserting that doctors are alert to drug companies' promotions in sponsored continuing education courses, he acknowledges research showing that doctors who attend such courses are more likely to prescribe the companies' drugs. Despite such detours, we find this book extremely valuable for anyone who believes that academic freedom and integrity truly matter. Academic leaders should read Bok's important, thoughtful and useful ideas on ways that colleges can minimize the risks of commercialization.	2005-08-04

Although he covers wildly varied topics, Chuck Klosterman's lively, stylish collection of essays speaks for and largely to one generation: Gen X. The author focuses not just on pop culture, but instead on pop culture's detritus. He doesn't discuss the best pop culture products. Rather, he covers the random bits and pieces that interest him. Some of these subjects merit his attention, such as popular television shows like The Real World, which have shaped later genres. Some of the other topics to which Klosterman turns his intelligence, ready wit (and occasionally profane tongue) are less obviously relevant - such as the meaning of breakfast cereal ads. He would argue that it doesn't matter, that everything in a society is connected and every part of popular culture tells us something about the way of life that produced it. Even so, you could still debate just what these specific items communicate - and while Klosterman's conclusions are always entertaining, many of them are highly debatable. In the areas such as music and celebrity journalism, where he is deeply experienced, his conclusions are more convincing and his ideas are most interesting. In other areas where he seems to spin positions from a more limited perspective, he is intriguing, but much less convincing. Despite this mixed menu and mixed perspective, we recommend this clever manuscript to pleasure readers who want a fun ride through pop land and to serious readers who are trying to understand the Gen X mindset.	2005-08-03

The RAND Corporation's organizational strategy advice is based on more than 50 years of research. Author Paul C. Light draws from RAND studies primarily related to the U.S. military to explain the need for organizations to confront unavoidable change with alertness, agility, adaptability and alignment. He notes that these four attributes are equally valuable to small and large businesses, and to organizations of all kinds. You can apply each solid lesson Light takes from RAND's studies to your organization's structure and planning. In fact, some of his points are already common wisdom. Political instability, labor force fluctuations, or the potential for terrorism or economic unrest affect some industries more than others, but every organization is susceptible to unanticipated developments. If you want to find out what to do when your organization gets surprised, we recommend this in-depth research-based report.	2005-07-29

So you want to sell your products or services to wealthy individuals, but you aren't exactly sure how to do it? Don't worry. In many ways, selling to the rich is the same as selling to anyone else you want to convert into a loyal customer, but with a few important twists that might take a little practice. Sure, the wealthy can be more demanding, but the potential return more than justifies the extra effort. Before he distills his techniques down to seven straightforward selling rules that might apply in other circumstances as well, author Matt Oechsli provides survey-generated facts about the wealthy. This book overflows with axioms, \\"commandments,\\" checklists, fill-in-the-blanks, calendar schedule pages, diagrams for business cards and numbered lists. All the sidebars suggest that there is science as well as \\"art\\" in selling to affluent buyers. We recommend this book for its useful insights into the high-stakes business of luxury sales.	2005-07-29

The corporate scandals of recent years have led to much hand wringing about corporate values. Now comes Stephen Young, head of the Caux Round Table - an international network of executives focused on corporate responsibility - with simple rules for turning the hand wringing into action. Some of Young's advice seems to be common sense: Tell the truth, for instance, and follow the law. By encouraging capitalists to go beyond following the letter of the law, Young offers a useful guide to ethical decision making. At times, though, he seems to give capitalists a free pass. For instance, Young argues that moral capitalists have little responsibility to withhold harmful products such as cigarettes and liquor from consumers who want to buy them. We  recommend this easy-to-digest study to anyone intrigued by the ethical implications of capitalism. The book is a useful presentation of the argument that capitalism, the most powerful economic system in history, must balance might and right.	2005-07-29

Montgomery Ward, Woolworth's and Pets.com stumbled into irrelevancy before they knew what hit them. Authors and retail consultants Willard Ander and Neil Stern explain what went wrong and tell retailers how to stay alive and thrive. They prescribe their theory, called \\"Est,\\" as in the superlative suffix. Be the best, they say, in assortment (biggest), price (cheapest), customer service (easiest), speed of service (quickest) or fashion (hottest). Being \\"pretty good\\" at everything no longer works. The abundance of choices in today's transparent, digital marketplace has spawned information-overloaded, fickle, demanding customers. The authors tend to generalize about what good companies are doing right rather than describing how also-ran retailers might turn things around, but there is plenty of advice here for those who are willing to take it. We recommend this glib pep talk of a book - if for no other reason than to jolt retailers out of believing they're doing everything possible to keep customers coming back.	2005-07-29

Sales folks by nature tend to be uninhibited, and when they become sought-after trainers and speakers, audiences reinforce this tendency by responding warmly to charming, oddball openers and anecdotes. In this case, however, even while providing substantial advice, author George Ludwig demonstrates that personal stories that bring down the house during a speech don't always translate into print. Moreover, a single anecdote, like a sharpshooter's bullet, often has more effect than a machine-gun spray of tales. Some of the stories (maybe the one about \\"Captain Underpants\\") don't contribute much. If you put the distracting anecdotes aside, however, what you have left is a very solid book capitalizing on the author's extensive practical experience. Has Ludwig cracked a genetic \\"sales code\\" that will help you earn more? Maybe not. However, his seven secrets are seven staples any salesperson needs. We believe that most sales professionals and sales trainers will benefit from his sound motivational and logistical advice.	2005-07-29

This report is an excellent, controversial and refreshing approach to global problems. Daily, the news media and politicians declare that another crisis is urgent. Often, loud, public resolutions accompany these pronouncements. Political blocs form to push through agendas based on those resolutions. The only thing missing from the process is a dispassionate analysis of whether the solutions make economic sense and, if so, which ones make the most economic sense. This book of compiled essays from the Copenhagen Consensus - as documented in The Economist - provides that missing element. The conference drew from United Nations documents to assemble a list of the most urgent problems facing the world and identified those that presented opportunities for solutions. Then it set the task of identifying solutions that would provide the biggest benefit for the cost, examining 38 proposals for spending $50 billion over four years. Surprisingly, some of the most economically rational projects never make headlines and never turn up in public exhortations. When was the last time you saw someone climbing onto a platform to demand mosquito nets to prevent malaria in Africa? That may not come up nearly as often as adherence to the Kyoto Protocol, which provides a far weaker cost vs. benefit scenario. According to the analysts from Copenhagen, the former seems to be a very sound use of the world's problem-solving resources, but the latter costs a lot and seems to deliver relatively few benefits. We highly recommend this intriguing, sweeping conversation.	2005-07-27

This folksy compilation of stories about people and companies who deliver \\"Positively Outrageous Service\\" (POS) has the right mix to prove that people love great service and the companies that deliver it. The stories may meander, but author T. Scott Gross is so popular because he knows how to weave humor, personal anecdotes and actual business stories into a cohesive argument that almost all business is personal and local. This form of bottom-up business advice places great importance upon the front-line employees who represent your business. Gross explains that front-line workers can make or break your brand and your sales, no matter what size your business is. He provides good business lessons, so don't let the light reading mislead you. We recommend this book to managers of any business in the service sector who want to give their employees the power and motivation to deliver great service.	2005-07-25

Author and veteran reporter Bob Woodward ends this book by saying, \\"There never is a final draft of history.\\" Perhaps, but his book turns the page on an era and on Deep Throat - the code name for FBI official W. Mark Felt - the pivotal secret source for the Watergate stories that helped bring down Richard Nixon's presidency. Remarkably, Woodward and his Washington Post colleagues protected their source's identity for more than 30 years. Woodward paints a compelling portrait of his almost tortured relationship with Felt, a father figure and mentor. Several times Felt came a hair's breadth from being exposed. Pained, Woodward admits that he missed his chance to uncover Felt's motivations for abetting the Post's investigative crusade. By the time Woodward tried to reconcile their troubled relationship, Felt was 87 and dementia had twisted his memory. Yet, Felt triumphed in his historic clash with Nixon. Woodward concludes, \\"By surviving and enduring his hidden life...in his own way, W. Mark Felt won.\\" Carl Bernstein's epilogue, \\"A Reporter's Assessment,\\" is an equally fascinating contribution. We most highly recommend this book, especially for those seeking a better understanding of the Watergate participants, whose actions will continue to ripple the waters of American politics for many years to come.	2005-07-22

The evidence is undeniable - most mergers fail and most acquisitions never achieve their promised synergies. Yet firms keep bidding top prices to acquire targets. Economists have a name for this phenomenon: the winner's curse. This theory says that the winner in any auction is apt to be the bidder who has most drastically overestimated the purchase's value. The winner, in this case, turns out to be a real loser. Authors Kenneth R. Ferris and Barbara S. Pecherot Petitt present compelling examples of companies that overpaid disastrously for acquisitions. They outline several approaches to valuation that might spare other companies from that sorry fate. We recommend this comprehensive and quite directly applicable book, which is full of cautionary notes and recommendations on how and when to use various valuation models. Why do companies continue to flirt with the winner's curse? The authors conclude, perhaps naively, that companies simply don't know how to correctly value their targets. Whatever the cause, there continue to be many cases where losing, rather than winning, would be a blessing to shareholders.	2005-07-22

If your organization needs to jump-start its creative processes, this accessible book may be helpful. It's broad enough to apply to all industries and has enough examples to provoke some serious thinking. Yet, Seth Godin, also the author of other zippy marketing books, sometimes gets carried away with his own evangelism and coinages (e.g., \\"edgecraft\\" for finding innovative product additions at the fringes of your current offerings). Still, Godin's thesis that small improvements and \\"soft\\" innovations can reap big benefits rings true, as his many examples make clear. His discussion about why ideas need champions, and how to be one, is also powerful. So if you want your marketing or product development staffers to juice up their creativity, we say this light little book might inspire them to think differently.	2005-07-21

The best leaders force their followers to face unpleasant realities and then figure out the solutions for themselves. That's why leadership is so risky, argue Ronald A. Heifetz and Marty Linsky in this engaging tome. The authors analyze the successes and failures of leaders ranging from Yitzhak Rabin to Bill Clinton, with stops along the way to examine the leadership styles of former Coca-Cola CEO M. Douglas Ivester and NBA coach Phil Jackson. At times, the authors' rules of thumb seem too general. Yet, their real-world examples blend well with their leadership theory to present a useful guide to leadership. We recommend this excellent book to anyone facing a difficult leadership situation.	2005-07-21

This is not a manual, but rather a collection of mostly useful tips for people who wish to start businesses, or even, as author Guy Kawasaki claims, other sorts of projects, including nonprofit organizations. Kawasaki may overuse business-babble such as \\"bootstrapping\\" or \\"rainmaking\\" (in fact, he recommends coming up with a brand name that can enter the language as a verb, such as Google or Xerox) - but his style is good-natured and humorous. The chapters are divided accessibly with subheads, charts, bullet points, \\"minichapters,\\" answers to \\"Frequently Avoided Questions\\" and reading lists, making it easy to find important points. Many of Kawasaki's \\"exercises\\" are tongue-in-cheek, like, \\"Go to eBay and search for used Aeron chairs.\\" He got his start working at Apple Computer, marketing early MacIntoshes, and he now runs a venture capital firm, Garage Technology Ventures. He refers to both frequently, and most of the book's examples come from these venues, not from inside knowledge of other start-ups, even though the author has been involved in several. This isn't the only book you'll need to read when you decide to start a business, but we find that its iconoclastic pointers are useful and fun, and its sections on pitching, recruiting and branding, in particular, apply to businesses of any size.	2005-07-20

You might say that author Anne Miller is like a homeowner who strikes oil while digging a ditch in the backyard. In this book, she shares knowledge she refined from more than 20 years of distilling metaphors. Her book leaves little doubt that metaphors can fuel the engines of your sales success. Its pages are full of colorful, persuasive anecdotes and analogies that follow one another like racecars coming out of Turn Four at Daytona. If you doubt whether her advice will apply to the rubber-meets-the-road realities of sales, just take Miller's ideas out for a test drive. Her primary expertise is in presentations, not sales, which may explain why her roadmap (note the extended metaphor) to success is so much more creative than most sales advice. Miller's book leaves many other tomes in the dust. We think sales professionals who read this book and master the art of the metaphor should get ready to take a victory lap or two.	2005-07-20

Imagine walking on the railroad tracks in a state of bliss, unaware of a train heading in your direction. Life feels good, albeit a bit empty. Suddenly, your big brother (the bully!) pushes you off the tracks with a hard shove. He hollers about your stupidity, laziness and indifference. In this fresh slap of a self-help book, author Larry Winget becomes your surrogate big brother. He delivers an unconventional helping of advice with punch, insight and a few well-deserved mental smacks. No subject is sacred. From religion to money, Winget gets into your business with practical, thoughtful suggestions. The text, which includes space to take notes and write down self-help action plans, is a workbook on motivation and drive. It works best when Winget advises you about employment, money and relationships. It's less successful when he preaches about murkier issues of religion, spirituality and teenage sex. Even when he oversteps, Winget is entertaining and helpful. (Don't miss the insightful, funny dedication.) we recommend this book to harried professionals, underachievers and anyone who needs a good mental thrashing to get up and get going. Now sit up straight.	2005-07-19

This book has become a classic of personal investment literature for good reasons. For one thing, watching Lynch lampoon Wall Street and its cadre of institutional investors is rich fun. He is, perhaps, the foremost money manager in the U.S., thanks to the success of Fidelity's multibillion-dollar Magellan Fund. Lynch says that when E.F. Hutton speaks, the average investor ought to take a nap. Although this is an updated edition, most of the content dates to \\"pre-bubble\\" 1989. As such, it offers haunting warnings about stocks with inflated price-to-earnings ratios. Warning to novice investors: Lynch is a Wharton grad who's been in the market since his college days and, as such, he tends to see stocks as simple and straightforward. Like the \\"Oracle of Omaha,\\" Warren Buffett, he's a quintessential value investor who looks for undervalued companies in nuts-and-bolts industries. The difference, as Lynch puts it, is that he buys those companies' stocks, while Buffett buys those companies. We strongly recommend this book to those who govern their own portfolios.	2005-07-19

Shane's excellent book focuses on technology entrepreneurs - no discussions of starting your own hair salon or sushi restaurant here. In fact, he notes that the original title specified \\"technology entrepreneurship\\" rather than entrepreneurship in general, though this is a valuable contribution to entrepreneurship literature. Most works on entrepreneurialism emphasize the personality characteristics of successful entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs, common wisdom says, are hard driving, charismatic and visionary. Shane turns sharply away from this \\"entrepreneurial cult of personality,\\" and presents a strong case that what really counts is picking the right industry to enter in the first place, and then proceeding correctly. We strongly recommend this to entrepreneurs because it guides them to the industries, strategies and perspectives that are likeliest to work. It indeed plows fertile ground.	2005-07-15

We highly recommend this classic of economic literature, one of the first (more or less) accessible presentations of the evidence against economic rationality. Economists have assumed, conventionally, that economic choice rests on a foundation of rationality. For instance, economists tend to think that people will put the same value on two mathematically identical offers. Yet laboratory experiments have proven what everyday experience suggests: people are not quite rational. Author Richard H. Thaler, a founding father of behavioral economics, presents convincing exhibits to make the case that the assumption of economic rationality is an awfully big pill to swallow. Stylistically, his book strikes a neat balance between accessibility and obscurity. A reader will need a certain amount of schooling in economics and a great deal of patience with academic prose to wade through every word of every chapter, although the payoff is substantial. However, it is possible for the impatient reader to get the gist by reading the introduction, the first page or two of each chapter and the epilogue. And even that is eminently worthwhile.	2005-07-15

Robert Mittelstaedt has written a rare, commendable book. He manages to address a significant business topic - the phenomenon of major corporate blunders - in an original, insightful and entertaining way. In this intriguing volume, he cites case after fascinating case where a series of seemingly small errors went uncorrected until a whole house of cards marked \\"faulty assumptions\\" came crashing down. The biggest mistake you can make is assuming that a fatal blunder just couldn't happen in your organization, and the second biggest is ignoring the warning signs that disaster is just ahead. The key, Mittelstaedt advises, is to learn to admit that something has gone wrong before the situation spirals out of control. We encourage every thoughtful business professional to read this substantive contribution to the field of risk management and disaster prevention.	2005-07-14

Shortly after author Richard Templar started his career, a boss whom he despised relegated him to the menial job of taking the CEO his morning coffee. Templar used this assignment as an opportunity to chat with the CEO for five minutes each day. One day Templar recommended that the CEO assign his unpopular boss elsewhere in the company. Soon the hated boss was gone, and Templar had learned his first lesson about taking advantage of the unwritten rules of the office. Books like this tend to come across as reiterations of Machiavelli's 'The Prince', promoting stratagems that work only if you're willing to behave like a conniving finalist on 'Survivor'. Yet, this book is actually useable and it has an interesting twist: Templar says it's only for those who are willing to work harder than everyone else. He writes, \\"These rules are not for...posers. They are for the really industrious, the talented, the hardworking, the naturally gifted, those who are prepared to put in some effort and burn some oil.\\" Templar's rules range from obvious to delightfully devious. He upholds ethical boundaries, however, and he's secure enough to lampoon himself to make a point. We recommend this fun, useful compendium to anyone who could use an official rulebook, spiced up with a little attitude, for the game of office politics.	2005-07-14

This unusual, entertaining business book covers one man's experience working for an unnamed, but top-line consulting firm. Author Martin Kihn tells unvarnished stories about working with clients who mix ambiguous problems with political infighting. The consulting firms he describes come off as unbalanced organizations with barely functioning teams and aged political hierarchies. Then there are the bleak working conditions and long weeks of travel, described in ways that completely dispel the glamorous myth of the globetrotting consultant. Throughout, Kihn keeps the story moving and funny, even though he sometimes gets too caught up in his own cleverness. Now and then, he seems to restrain his real opinion and the resulting conclusion seems flimsy compared to his other material, but soon he gets back to deflating jargon and popping myths. Even though it is an additional rock being hurled in the hailstorm of consultant bashing, we recommend this funny, informative book to anyone working with consultants or considering a consulting career.	2005-07-14

Christensen's first book, 'The Innovator's Dilemma,' was a work of impressive insight and originality. His second, 'The Innovator's Solution,' was somewhat less insightful but added a necessary extension to the first by telling readers how they might begin to extricate themselves from the dilemma of industry disruption caused by an upstart innovation. The current book is a dense, harder to read compilation of the first two books, with added theoretical insights. Christensen and co-authors Scott D. Anthony and Erik A. Roth tell readers how to use theories of innovation to predict change. We applaud the effort. Don't miss the helpful appendix that summarizes the previous two books.	2005-07-14

Many business books provide just enough information to whet executives' appetites for more advice accompanied by high consulting fees. Author Kees van der Heijden has written an exception. His comprehensive volume puts scenario building in historical context, explains its relationship to forecasting and tells you how to introduce scenario planning to your organization. Once you understand your corporate identity and your fundamental \\"Business Idea,\\" he says, you can establish and enact informative scenarios that will prepare your company for several different versions of what lies ahead. In that way, scenario planning generates better decision making. We strongly recommend this book to top managers, strategists and planners, especially those who sense they're making decisions on the fly without having a structure for thinking deeply about future implications.	2005-07-14

Smith is extremely down to earth. He presents his suggestions for how to recognize the emotional components of negotiations in clear and fairly basic English. He illustrates each suggestion with one or more stories and then distills the suggestions into brief, pointed lessons. Because of its clarity, we recommend this book to all levels of readers who will be engaging in negotiation. You will find something you can use. However, some of Smith's techniques can be applied only over the course of time, such as allotting time to videotape practice negotiations and to analyze the level of rapport you manage to establish. Other suggestions are extremely challenging, such as committing oneself consciously to developing and practicing empathy. Therefore, while the book can be read profitably by anyone - and enjoyably, given Smith's folksy honesty - unless you are a committed, experienced negotiator, you may not be interested in all of Smith's lessons or even able to apply them.	2005-07-07

The dilemma for top-ranking companies is that by doing all of the things that lead to success, they may doom themselves to failure. Disruptive innovations typically debut at the low end of the market or among nonusers, as unprofitable, unpromising and crude products, in comparison to the mainstream standards. Then, established companies make the understandable mistake of ignoring them, only to be overtaken from below. Author Clayton M. Christensen's previous classic, `The Innovator's Dilemma', identified this problem. This subsequent book offers a solution by helping managers identify potentially disruptive innovations, correctly read the market and the competitive environment, and develop a response. This book is not quite as innovative or provocative as its predecessor, but it is a valuable extension of Christensen's theory. If you want to know what your company can do about this serious competitive problem, we recommend this solid follow-up.	2005-07-07

It doesn't matter what level of the organization your new leadership role is in - from project supervisor to CEO - every promotion brings a period of transition, the need for new skills and a set of new expectations, challenges and opportunities. Just because you've been successful in one leadership role, you can't assume that your old strategy will automatically succeed in your new role. It probably won't. Take an analytical approach. Diagnose the situation and adapt your strategy to it. Michael Watkins' book tells you exactly how. If you will soon begin - or have already begun - a new leadership role, this book is an invaluable resource to help you map out your strategy, get on your boss's good side and accelerate your transition. Watkins provides fundamental information for anyone who wants to become a leader and stay on top, because he teaches you how to make a successful transition when your time comes. We recommend this excellent book to any leader at any level who is going through or embarking on a period of transition into a new role. Here's how to help make the transition more successful, faster and easier - on your staff, your boss and yourself.	2005-07-07

Oliver Crom and Michael Crom have written a very good book for sales professionals who are on a learning curve, particularly newcomers and those with intermediate sales experience. Although veterans might know most of the new ideas here, the authors present valuable concepts in the excellent prospecting section and in the review of how to close a sale. The book presents a somewhat institutional Dale Carnegie approach to sales, including a strong emphasis on maintaining a positive attitude and a customer-centered approach. The section on overcoming objections could be juiced up a bit and many of the illustrative anecdotes could be developed more richly, but the book supplies significant expertise for newer sales professionals - and that alone, we believe, should make it an easy sell.	2005-07-07

Christensen's excellent book is a classic of strategy literature. The innovator's dilemma is that doing the right things can lead to failure. Sometimes it is wrong to listen to customers, invest in the highest return opportunities and do all of the things that made a successful company succeed. Clearly written, amply documented, provocative and challenging, this book is indispensable for anyone in business. If it has a shortcoming, it is that it focuses more on the dilemma than on resolving it and it does not offer specific remedial prescriptions. However, Christensen has authored or co-authored two other books that attempt to remedy that deficiency. We heartily recommend this book, which remains the leader of the three. It has the potential to change the way managers think about business - any business.	2005-07-06

Jeff Thull is a highly regarded consultant whose client list reads like a who's who of big business. He is also the author of the insightful book, Mastering the Complex Sale. Does this new volume live up to the promise of that one? It depends on what you are seeking. Given that its title, The Prime Solution, sounds like a brand of steak sauce, be prepared to chew your way through terms like \\"decision acuity\\" (i.e., help your clients understand what's really going on), \\"solution opportunities\\" (i.e., answers) and \\"value promise delivery\\" (i.e., implementation). Such stylistic nuisances aside, the book diagnoses and documents a \\"value gap,\\" the shortfall between the value that buyers receive versus what they feel they bought. Thull attributes this gap primarily to flaws in how providers of business-to-business products design, sell and execute their complex \\"solutions\\" or offerings. He suggests ways to address those flaws, along with many useful cases and good practical advice for consultants, particularly in the last three chapters. We recommend this book to experienced consultants who sell solutions. Our one caveat: just don't beef about the vocabulary.	2005-07-06

This book could be subtitled \\"A Survival Manual for Those Stuck in the Middle.\\" In the modern hierarchical (read \\"authoritarian\\") organization, the beleaguered middle manager is indeed stuck in the middle. Author Harold J. Leavitt is a self-professed \\"humanizer\\" who acknowledges the dehumanizing, authoritarian tendencies of the modern hierarchical organization. However, he goes beyond automatic humanistic inclinations to ask an important question: \\"What's the alternative?\\" Hierarchies have structured human activity for centuries. They've learned to cloak themselves in commoners' clothes in order to do business in egalitarian cultures, but don't let that fool you. Large organizations are still ruled by hierarchies, and woe unto the middle manager who forgets it. Leavitt's book evinces empathy for the plight of the unsung middle manager who has to meet the company's objectives while helping it appear to be something it's not: caring and humanistic. We highly recommend this book to all managers caught in the middle - which is to say, all managers.	2005-07-05

Squarely addressed to people with scant knowledge of China, this anecdotal excursion into the economics of the Middle Kingdom is dilettantish in the best sense of the word. Those who know China will learn only illustrative tales here, but those who do not know China will learn what even the most scrupulously accurate journalists cannot always convey: the feel of the place. Author Ted C. Fishman explores Shanghai shops, Shenzhen factories and markets for female companionship euphemistically known as karaoke halls, and he manages to put everything in the context of China's economic development. No doubt many readers will come away convinced that China is a threat - indeed, part of the author's purpose is to show how China challenges the world. He does that convincingly by alternating vignettes of China with vignettes of America. Critics may quibble, and not without reason, that the book is superficial, uncritical and naïve. Granted. But we counter: it's a heck of a read.	2005-07-04

In an era when so many CEOs feel business would be great if only they didn't have to manage employees, we recommend William J. Rothwell's authoritative human resources classic. Its ideas converge nicely with the growing corporate requirement for a verifiable return on investment (ROI) for every activity. In the eyes of Human Performance Enhancement (HPE) experts, traditional training methods are too expensive, not very useful and too focused on behavior rather than on attaining organizational goals. Anyone who has experienced the corporate training phenomenon of \\"sheep-dipping\\" may agree that business training programs have room for improvement. This volume and its companion CD - complete with Power Point presentations - is a tremendous resource for training and human resources professionals, especially those seeking a fresh, practical approach to human performance.	2005-07-01

This overwhelming book succumbs to the very scope of its ambition and the topics it covers: globalization and technology. Author Thomas Friedman literally covers the world for `The New York Times', and his access to important local authorities, corporate executives, local `Times' bureaus and researchers, the Internet and a tape recorder has enabled him to compile a huge amount of information. All of it buttresses his views about the important convergence of political and technological change. He offers interesting anecdotes about companies worldwide and intriguing conversations with friends, reporters and experts. But Friedman, well-spoken expert that he is, still needs an editor to tame his long chapters and repeated points. He conveys abundant knowledge, with incisive insights and interpretations, but skim where you must. With that caveat, we warmly recommend this wide-ranging treatment of technology's role in global business and politics.	2005-06-30

First published in 1996, this management literature classic builds a bridge between traditional, short-term oriented management systems and a more balanced approach integrating new types of measurements into a comprehensive strategy. This book looks senior managers in the eye and asks, \\"Are you ready for the future?\\" Some executives respond to the challenge of change by tinkering, adding a few nonfinancial metrics to the \\"instrumentation cockpit\\" that tells them how their corporate ship is running. Others have spurned Balanced Scorecard because it requires CEOs to accept feedback from all levels of their organizations so they will know if their assumptions remain relevant amidst rapid change. To date, however, more than 300 major organizations have used this system to enhance their performance, and future prospects. Abraham Lincoln once said that the best thing about the future is that it comes only one day at a time. With apologies to Lincoln, we recommend this book to all senior executives and managers - because the future will be here sooner than you think.	2005-06-30

Kotter's book tells it all: a group of penguins are shuffling their feet nervously on an icy precipice, while one brave bird leaps for the water below. The question is, which penguin are you? In too many organizations, executives shy away from the precipice, while someone lower down in the pecking order jumps in to test the landing conditions. Kotter says managers and leaders are quite different. A manager, he explains, is trained to think in a linear, one-two-three, risk-limiting way. Transformational change, however, can only be attained when true leaders push forward on several fronts at once - eight of them to be exact. Every successful change initiative begins with a coalition of leaders who create a sense of urgency. Kotter's book stems from a 1995 Harvard Business Review article titled, \\"Leading Change: Why Transformation Efforts Fail.\\" It will probably sound hauntingly familiar to managers who have watched change initiatives begin in the front courtyard with a marching band and end a few months later, ushered out the back door like a diner who can't pay the tab. If you want to know why your last change initiative fizzled, we say read this book. Better yet, study it to ensure that your next leap of faith is a flying success.	2005-06-24

First, it's relevant without taking itself too seriously. The light, self-effacing - even occasionally tongue-in-cheek - tone makes it easily readable. Authors Sheldon Bowles, Richard Silvano and Susan Silvano actively engage readers with a brief interactive online test that reveals your personality \\"guild type.\\" Then they draw on their narrative's strength to move forward. Many books about emotional intelligence give readers little practical help. This one is fun, helpful and entertaining even though its guild classification system may need additional tweaking. Apparently designed primarily for workplace applications, it lacks the specificity of the more familiar Myers-Briggs test, which in comparison practically predicts how you'll want your eggs cooked a month from next Tuesday. Notwithstanding these minor limitations, we recommend this book to managers, coaches, consultants, EQ practitioners and those HR folks burdened with softening the Type A corporate hearts who run most organizations.	2005-06-23

In this thoroughly researched, documented, footnoted book, author Gerald Zaltman opens a gateway into a deep, fertile field for marketing professionals. After a thorough review of traditional marketing research techniques based on the abysmal failures of consumer surveys and focus groups, Zaltman addresses the importance of the subconscious in framing consumer attitudes and behaviors. He cites a wide variety of interdisciplinary sources, including results from biochemical research about brain function. This is definitely not a light read, but it has insight and offers great potential for dedicated, large corporation marketers who have a background in behavioral science. While the book is interesting and challenging, it is also dense and sometimes repetitive. The book explores an interesting metaphysical discussion and uses apt case studies to drive home key points, yet its practical application is open to discussion. For instance, how can marketers practically find the intersection between their subconscious and the consumer's subconscious, as Zaltman suggests? We recommend this thought-provoking work to all research-oriented marketing executives.	2005-06-22

Maxwell has spent years thinking about leadership and ethical action, and it shows. In this short volume, he condenses his years of reflection into clear, accessible principles that any reader can immediately apply. He supports his points with anecdotes, and with quotes from sacred texts and authors from a variety of cultures. His clarity makes his work bold. There's no way you could mistake what he's saying, and that's refreshing, especially given contemporary concerns about corporate governance. While the simplicity and brevity of the book makes it broadly accessible, we especially recommend it to two readerships: those already dedicated to living ethically, who are looking for tools to apply, and those who are skeptical about the utility of ethics. The book (which was previously published as \\"There's No Such Thing as Business Ethics\\") has only two real weaknesses. The first is that Maxwell's definition of an ethical dilemma is far too simple, and he treats it too briefly. (What do we do when love and duty clash? What do we do when directly ordered to do something unethical by a superior, who thinks the action is correct - and someone else depends upon our income?) The second is that Maxwell discusses how to treat others as if we were all the same deep down. Perhaps we are - but he doesn't fully address the many personal and cultural differences that one must negotiate along the way. Our moral dilemma: is it right to dwell on such relatively minor flaws in a book we basically respect, agree with, appreciate and recommend warmly? You be the judge.	2005-06-22

Anyone can apply the principles in John C. Maxwell's book, in any business, in any circumstance, in any stage of life. Great thinkers have an unlimited capacity to achieve, and Maxwell tells you how to become one. While books of this nature are typically geared toward entrepreneurs or those in leadership roles, we recommend this book to any person who is committed to ongoing personal development and living life with purpose. You will benefit from learning more about the different specific thinking skills that have an impact on your daily decisions. Maxwell teaches an unusual skill: how to make conscious choices that shape your thoughts, your actions and, ultimately, your success. Think about it.	2005-06-22

Well-trained sales professionals have a big edge over their fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants competition, so if your job is training them, here's a tool you will appreciate. Author Jim Makula's manual for sales trainers demonstrates an accurate, complete understanding of the sales process and the sales professional's mindset. His training manual comes with sample class agendas, worksheets, training exercises and even an enclosed CD with Power Point slides. Although it is not especially strong on training people to overcome objections or close sales, the practical advice it offers particularly on attitude and networking is otherwise dead-on. We recommend this book to every sales trainer. It won't transform your staff into Brian Tracy and Zig Ziglar clones, but it will help you create a more professional, skilled sales force. And that should be worth a lot to your firm's bottom line.	2005-06-21

The fact that executives keep trying new strategic initiatives despite their abysmal rate of failure is, like second marriages, a triumph of hope over experience. Or, it may indicate just how much pressure top managers face to improve their profits. By one estimate, nine out of ten companies fail to execute their strategic visions. Yet, CEOs - who witness a world in constant flux - continue to introduce change initiatives. Are they trapped in the operational definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result? Or, are they just ready for this book? Authors Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton offer wise counsel to help executives break the cycle of strategic flops. They advise executives to transform their companies into \\"Strategy-Focused Organizations\\" using the \\"Balanced Scorecard\\" and \\"strategic mapping\\" tools. With these initiatives, CEOs can ensure that every employee pays attention to strategy implementation. Kaplan and Norton, the all-star co-author team who wrote \\"The Balanced Scorecard\\" and \\"Strategy Maps\\", have done it again, in this well-organized but somewhat dry volume. We strongly recommend this book to any manager who is responsible for designing or implementing a strategic change initiative.	2005-06-20

If author Michael E. Porter had walked up to buy a cup of punch from you, he probably would have asked about your business strategy. While you poured, he would have questioned what made your lemonade different from anyone else's. If he liked your lemonade, he'd no doubt give you suggestions on how to earn millions competing in the global marketplace. Ah, if only you had listened... The author, America's dean of competition, has spent two decades asking seminal questions such as, \\"What is competition? What are its effects? How can society benefit?\\" The Harvard Business Review previously published 11 of the 13 articles collected in this book. In the two new essays, Porter serves up invaluable concepts. His take on the growing importance of location, despite rising globalization, is a tour de force. Oddly, Porter sees no inconsistency in encouraging \\"productive competition\\" in the health care industry while advocating universal health care. For Porter, competition is the ingredient that turns lemons into lemonade. We recommend his latest book to any corporate strategist who seeks ideas on becoming more competitive, starting in your own neighborhood.	2005-06-20

Comedian Bill Cosby once sang a metaphorical ditty about a man who sat on the railroad tracks each day, only to be hit by a train. He knew when the train was coming, but he just couldn't apply that knowledge to get out of the way. That circumstance will sound hauntingly familiar to corporate consultants. Consider the experience of two consultants conducting deregulation research for a Latin American utility company. They stumbled over an excellent 500-page report completed years previously by a prior consultant. The document had all the information and analysis the company was seeking, but it had never been utilized. Authors Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert I. Sutton expose the alarming gap between what senior managers know and what they actually implement. After four years of intensive research into this issue, they uncover valuable lessons on how to make sure your organization doesn't talk itself to death. Today's companies are struggling to overcome inertia and become more nimble. That's why we strongly recommend this book for managers at every level; if nothing else, you'll know what you ought to be doing.	2005-06-20

If this book were a Hollywood film, it might be titled \\"Son of Balanced Scorecard\\" or even \\"Balanced Scorecard III.\\" This book, however, is no mere spin-off or sequel. In two prior works, \\"The Balanced Scorecard\\" (which you may wish to read before reading this book) and \\"The Strategy-Focused Organization\\", authors Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton introduced the powerful concept of measuring the elusive intangibles that affect organizations. This information-dense book was born when the authors observed that CEOs instinctively draw arrows to explain their goals. This led to a breakthrough realization: \\"Objectives should be linked in cause-and-effect relationships.\\" The graphic display of these relationships is a \\"strategy map.\\" This book breaks new ground by providing a template so executives can be sure that their strategic planning omits nothing. It expands the concepts of \\"strategic themes\\" and \\"value-creating processes,\\" and explains a system for aligning your organization's strategy with its intangible assets. However, the real-world examples may be lost on CEOs who are unfamiliar with MBA-style case studies. If you're implementing a \\"Balanced Scorecard\\" initiative or planning your firm's future, we say this is a blockbuster you don't want to miss.	2005-06-17

Author Jeffrey Gitomer's book's jacket refers to him as, \\"the modern leader of salesmanship.\\" Given that splashy buildup, his book has to be an attention-getter - and it is. The contents are displayed in modern, freewheeling big fonts and graphics. The illustrations feature intriguing black-and-white, scratchy images of NCR founder John Patterson demonstrating his eccentric, but fundamental, approach to sales. Something about Gitomer's book is inexplicably charming, perhaps due to his boyish love of industrial history and his unapologetic idol worship of Patterson, an American sales icon. Gitomer, who \\"revised and revived\\" Patterson's rules, obeys the motto, \\"Think!\\" In an era when business intently focuses on maximized sales, why not look to history for some winning answers? Patterson's \\"Probable Purchaser\\" concept is a powerful idea, and the book's dicta are broad in scope if not deep. We believe Gitomer deserves fair credit for this thought-provoking work of industrial archaeology and encourages salespeople to read his book.	2005-06-17

By interviewing 400 individuals from 130 businesses to get their change sagas, authors John P. Kotter and Dan S. Cohen further anchor the fresh approach to organizational change that Kotter presented in 'Leading Change' (1996). Their main insight: organizations change when their people change. And, people change for emotional reasons. Some readers may think that the emphasis on feelings is \\"soft\\" or even \\"distracting,\\" but the authors warn against relying on spreadsheets or reports to promote transformation. They insist that the best way to engage the emotions is not to \\"tell\\" but to \\"show\\" - in videos, displays or even office design. The visual sense, they point out, processes enormous amounts of complex information instantly. At the end of each chapter, the authors include useful, modestly titled, \\"Exercises That Might Help.\\" With appreciation for that level of detail, we recommend this illuminating book. Kotter has presented his eight-step change model before, but this practical, compact work demonstrates - with plainspoken stories of real-life managers and companies - how it functions. Thus the form of the book - \\"showing\\" - exactly replicates its main point.	2005-06-17

This intriguing, intellectual study of disastrous leadership offers a courageous interpretation of corporate scandal and political folly. Amoral leaders are not entirely to blame, Jean Lipman-Blumen argues. Rather, followers enable misguided leaders to rise to power and stay there. Her analysis applies psychological principles to Adolf Hitler's Germany and Jeff Skilling's Enron (not exactly parallel, but you get the idea) and concludes that toxic leaders' followers are willing victims who allowed misguided bosses to appeal to their basest instincts. While Lipman-Blumen's assertions are startling, she makes a compelling case written in dense but readable prose with intriguing detail. We suggest this book to anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the relationship between leaders and their followers, particularly given the swath cut by today's toxic leaders.	2005-06-15

In spite of grueling hours and brutal conditions, hard work is no guarantee of prosperity in the American economy. So writes journalist David Shipler in this exhaustive study of the folks left behind by the American economic boom. Shipler talks to factory workers in New Hampshire, farm workers in North Carolina and garment workers in California. He paints a picture of a predatory economy with little room for the unsophisticated and unskilled. This work, which was nominated for a prestigious National Book Critics' Circle Award, is ambitious in its scope and compelling in its detail. Some readers, however, might chafe at Shipler's refusal to accept either liberal or conservative formulas: after presenting ample evidence of the poor's own culpability for their plight, however partial, he blames both, an indifferent society and family dysfunction for poverty. We strongly recommend this sweeping study to employers and to anyone interested in the seemingly intractable gap between rich and poor.	2005-06-10

The odds are overwhelmingly against merger success - academic studies say 70% of mergers fail. Yet the biggest, most successful companies in the world grew through mergers and acquisitions. Building a global corporation from organic growth alone is nearly impossible. In this excellent discussion of merger basics, authors David Harding and Sam Rovit point out some facts that most academic analyses of mergers ignore. They show how successful acquirers tilt the odds in their favor. The secret is experience, doing a lot of small deals and focusing relentlessly on each investment. The mergers most likely to falter are the big deals that make the papers and wind up proving the academic case that most mergers fail. We encourage CEOs to read this book - especially CEOs whose consultants and investment bankers have been advising them to acquire or merge.	2005-06-08

This breakthrough book provides an organized framework for identifying and implementing out-of-the-box \\"blue ocean strategies\\" in all industries. The blue ocean strategy explains how to sail your business into new markets with less competition and greater profitability. Disarmingly written by W. Chan Kim and Ren&eacute;e Mauborgne, the book is energized with fresh research about the impact of innovative ideas on old industries. The compelling business examples alone are worth taking this cruise. Even the appendices make interesting reading and contain more detailed examples about products ranging from the Model T to movie theaters (the authors explain how innovators reinvented theaters and created their own blue ocean phenomena). While the book provides its share of rules and principles for intrepid strategists to follow, complete with its own jargon, managers easily can navigate right to the authors' key strategic advice. We consider this book essential for any strategist or entrepreneur who wants to move out of intensively competitive shark-infested waters and into the relative tranquility of the open blue ocean. Getting there isn't risk-free, but great adventure awaits the intrepid executive who makes the voyage.	2005-06-07

Most marketing books discuss how marketers should relate to their customers. Some use a formal, objective approach to penetrate the wall that separates the service or product provider from the consumer. This book promotes a very different, softer \\"anthro-journalistic\\" tactic: learning consumers' desires by hearing their stories and reflecting those wishes in the product's design. This leads to giving the product its own stories to \\"tell\\" potential customers, in a mutual social network based on shared meaning. The idea borrows the power of the oral tradition from anthropology and applies it to word-of-mouth product promotion. Author John Winsor stresses listening and storytelling as ways for trained marketers to understand customers and sell to them. Although his treatise dips occasionally into slightly airy New Age sensibilities, Winsor's information on the flaws of focus groups and the importance of heartfelt, meaningful customer feedback tells a story of its own. Of course, applying a cultural anthropologist's perspective to marketing will work better for some businesses than others. We think this book will intrigue and possibly challenge marketers who want to break out of branding buzz and explore new ideas.	2005-05-31

A book of tales must rise or fall on the quality of the stories it presents. And in that regard, this storybook earns a mixed report card. Most of the stories are clear and pithy, although some hint at change without being directly related to it. A case in point is \\"The Old Man and his Grandson,\\" a brief moral tale about the need to demonstrate empathy and the fact that everyone grows older. Other stories, however, are perfectly apropos and even come with a hint of humor to prod listeners to accept change. Unnervingly, some of the less engaging stories come from author Margaret Parkin's personal experiences. On the other hand, her informative introduction makes a compelling case for the power of narrative in introducing and abetting transformation. She supplies excellent questions for further study after each story to keep the discussion on point. Overall, we recommend this book to those who would like to add a few new anecdotes to their quiver. If just one helps spur your organization be more flexible, that will be a success story worth telling.	2005-05-31

Editor Peter Cheverton is a guru of KAM, and this book somewhat modifies and tailors his basic KAM approach to fit the needs of the financial services industry. The tailoring is slight, mainly a matter of streamlining the style, although that is welcome. One brief but very useful section discusses the importance of dealing with and through intermediaries. In fact, many financial services vendors work through intermediaries, distributing their products or services through banks, insurance companies, mutual fund companies or others. Cheverton and his co-editors, Tim Hughes, Bryan Foss and Merlin Stone, usefully point out that it is important not to consider the intermediary as the customer. Instead, the vendor should look through the intermediary to the final user and assist the intermediary in developing an offering that suits the needs and preferences of that end user. People who have read Cheverton's \\"Key Account Management\\" will learn little new here, but we believe that those who have not - particularly those in the financial services sector - will benefit from this shorter, easier book.	2005-05-25

In this hotly controversial book, author Sam Harris faults religion for being illogical, for inciting societies to violence and for not reconciling faith and reason. Many classic thinkers and theologians struggled with this question, including Maimonides and Aquinas, who are absent from the index. Such omissions lead one to acknowledge the author's passionate writing perhaps more than his scholarship, which is also open to some challenge as he explains the tenets of various faiths. Harris, who has a compelling narrative style, provokes readers to confront their own philosophies as he asks another ancient question: why does a good God permit evil? Harris's anti-religious discourse promotes reason as a panacea and asserts that spiritual living does not require religious practice. He particularly examines the role of extremist religious belief in its most violent manifestations, such as Jihad. He asks why polite society cannot criticize religion if it motivates suicide bombers and terrorist attacks. Unfortunately, however, Harris follows the Pied Piper of rationalism off the cliff by articulating a dispiriting, dangerous message against tolerating religious tolerance itself. If you want to provoke some spirited conversations, or reconsider venerable philosophical issues in the light of difficult modern times, we believe this may intrigue you. Readers who share Harris' fury about religion's influence will find their opinions vigorously supported, while those who believe that religion is a force for good will find that reading this book is an opportunity to exercise the patience of a saint.	2005-05-25

The geopolitical landscape evolves so fast that almost any book about global politics ages before the ink can dry. Zbigniew Brzezinski - known as one of the keenest students of American defense and diplomacy since his service in the Carter administration - urges European-American rapprochement over Iraq. He calls for a transition from a war against terrorism to a moral war for global equality and political representation, namely, democracy. No doubt due to unfortunate timing, his book does not account for recent democratic elections in the Middle East or for new transatlantic diplomatic initiatives. Regardless, he uses his laser-beam intellect to show convincingly how globalism, American geopolitical dominance and American cultural imperialism are interacting to create a perfect storm of misunderstanding that leaves Uncle Sam with a tough choice: how to react to terrorism without overreacting and causing U.S. isolation. He concludes that America can choose to lead or to dominate, but not both. We strongly recommend this book to students of globalism and the ongoing experiment of global democracy.	2005-05-21

Authors Connie Brown Glaser and Barbara Steinberg Smalley deftly combine solid reporting of facts, figures and poll results with insightful stories about women who have abandoned the corporate rat race. This concise look at a pivotal trend is not limited to women only, though they are its emphasis. The authors introduce high-powered executive women who seek more purpose, balance and fulfillment, and find it by taking less stressful positions, starting their own businesses or switching careers. Much of the story is told through the personal case histories of corporate strivers who decide to chuck it all and go home. Many of these pioneers asked, \\"What good is all this money when I have no time to enjoy it?\\" They got tired of being \\"corporate machines,\\" sick of jeopardizing their health and their important relationships. While many employers now understand that satisfaction, purposefulness and appreciation can trump money, some ground still need to get broken here. We highly recommend this book to people at all levels in the work force because it will help you consider your destiny - even if you love the electricity of corporate life and would be bored to tears making gift baskets in your garage.	2005-05-20

Any professional whose job involves inspiring and motivating other professionals to work as a team probably has a pretty good idea of what it's like to conduct a symphony with an orchestra of soloists. Author Geoff Smith has written a very useful book that will help you harmonize your band of hotshots. While some professionals relish team interaction, many appear allergic to harnessing their brilliance on behalf of the group. Law firms, CPA practices, ad agencies, architecture offices, research labs and other service firms all rely on professionals. But to move the firm ahead, those professionals should check their egos at the door. Not very likely, you may think, and you'd be right. At least, not likely without this book's coaching on how to manage professionals with a light touch and still get the job done. We strongly recommend this book to those leading professionals in small and medium-sized firms, more so than in corporations, though it will help anyone who wants to make the members of a professional team march to the beat of a not-so-different drummer.	2005-05-19

From a modern perspective, a ditch allowing barges to travel between Rust Belt cities in upstate New York hardly seems the stuff of high drama. But well-regarded economist and historian Peter L. Bernstein accomplishes the tough task of making readers care about the Erie Canal, the massive public works project that he believes changed the course of U.S. and world politics and trade. This compelling study portrays the waterway as a project involving enough risk and adventure to make a dot-com entrepreneur pale. Bernstein girds its history with ample modern-day perspectives to keep you interested. He does bog down at times in the arcane convolutions of early nineteenth century political disputes, but still spins a mostly fascinating yarn. We recommend this book to anyone looking for insight into this pivotal point in America's - and, perhaps, the world's - economic development.	2005-05-19

Tricky as it may sound to execute, this is a solid, concise introduction to reward strategy and management. Authors Michael Armstrong and Helen Murlis begin with the broadest, most elementary definition of reward strategy and management, but quickly dig down to pay dirt. They provide insider details on job evaluation schemes, antidiscrimination legislation, motivation and the other logistical choices required for reward management. Considered a classic by some in the field, their book offers quite a granular discussion of grade and pay structures, performance management, contingent pay and even the use of consultants. Its primary flaw is its steady use of one author's employer - the Hay Group consulting firm - as the constant exemplar of reward scheme models and methods. We find that this thorough, practical book provides all the ingredients you need to cook up a \\"best practices\\" reward management program.	2005-05-17

You may feel waves of regret as you read this book and imagine how your life might have been different if you had studied it earlier in your career.

Author Martin John Yate delivers savvy advice in plain language. With warnings about the dangers of \\"windbag\\" statements, industry jargon and hostile body language, Yate provides a no-nonsense tour through the job-hunting process. The text includes a great worksheet for developing and tracking job leads and contacts. Unfortunately, the author sometimes is gung-ho about specific points so some sections are repetitive. But overall, we recommend these insights to all job seekers.	2005-05-13

This book describes in great detail how major British corporations have become more socially responsible. Editor John Hancock includes in-depth chapters from various British experts and executives on key topics related to social responsibility, including investing, the environment, corporate governance and improving the quality of life. The contributors describe how the corporate social responsibility (CSR) movement is changing the way many U.K. companies conduct their day-to-day operations. U.S. corporate managers who are contending with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance may feel somewhat challenged as they read about how their U.K. counterparts now feel obligated to conduct business in a way that meets CSR standards. In fact, many U.S. business leaders may feel that the CSR push smacks of unprecedented outside interference in company goals. Since this movement is likely to strengthen, we believe this book is essential for British executives, of great interest to their U.S. peers and important to all corporate strategists and leaders. Never mind that the text is dry, and the various authors' subjects sometimes overlap. Senior executives who even skim it will get a pretty clear idea of capitalism's next phase - and many may not like what they learn.	2005-05-13

Like many books on leadership from nonbusiness walks of life, this sea tale offers a refreshing new perspective. U.S. Navy Captain D. Michael Abrashoff explains how he and his crew turned their under-performing vessel into the pride of the Pacific Fleet. His colorful, somewhat self-promotional style of storytelling makes it enjoyable, especially for those who are curious about life on a guided missile destroyer. What is less clear, however, is how to apply the Captain's lessons from a naval vessel to the business of running an ordinary corporation. \\"Generate unity\\" and \\"build up your people\\" are noble maxims, but how do you apply them in a corporate environment where the greatest threat often stems from friendly fire? In any case, the Captain offers engaging stories about how he steered the USS Benfold back on course. We recommend his book to executives and students of management who appreciate an anecdotal approach to shipshape leadership.	2005-05-13

Consulting is considered one of the most profitable professions, and is one of the last to remain unregulated. As a result, it attracts a variety of firms and people who often exaggerate their capabilities in an effort to gain attention and attract business. Authors Jay Conrad Levinson and Michael W. McLaughlin succumb to the same problem as consultants who promise their clients too much. The \\"breakthrough tactics\\" they advertise on the book's front cover never quite materialize and the promise deflates the sound advice they do provide. The first two-thirds of the book addresses \\"guerrilla marketing,\\" a term used to sell other books, but not particularly apt for the familiar tactics here. However, the authors provide a good rundown on some solid, well-accepted components of marketing, such as public relations, advertising, surveys, books, speeches, Web sites and 'pro bono' work. They teach good management, which can transform and re-energize these tactics. Things pick up a little in the final third of the book as the authors discuss sales techniques, including pricing, dealing with competition and preparing a proposal. We suggest this useful (if not warrior-like) book to beginning marketers and consultants, and to the owners of small consulting firms.	2005-05-13

Authors Sarah Cook, Steve Macaulay and Hilary Coldicott offer a solid, reliable roadmap for navigating the twisted trails of corporate change initiatives. This comprehensive presentation is based on the authors' combined 40 years of consulting and change-facilitation experience. The book provides a wealth of self-diagnostic tests, interactive exercises and checklists to help you tackle the practical mechanics of introducing organizational change from all four compass points: business, politics, emotions and the spirit. The volume demonstrates little patience with the self-serving \\"practical\\" case studies that are 'de rigueur' in business books. While one might applaud the authors' sense of economy in eliminating \\"how great we are\\" stories, their absence may also explain why the book comes across as just a tad dry. Change is a perpetually dynamic story line, so one expects its roadmap to bear a range of narrative hues, although the sound advice here is rare enough. We strongly recommend this volume - when you're lost, any good map is your friend. It doesn't have to be fancy as long as it includes a compass.	2005-05-12

This book benefits those who face exhaustion from overwork, stress and overuse of the word 'yes' - and that includes almost everyone. No matter what level of employment or management you are in, where you work or what your responsibilities are, most people have a natural propensity to say 'yes' far too often. Jana Kemp's book will help if you sometimes say 'yes' when you don't want to, or even when you are not fully capable of committing to and delivering on the promise you are making. She offers tools and advice for timely, sound decision-making. Even though the book's self-assessment mechanisms, introspective exercises and checklists can get a bit repetitive, reinforcement is the best way to change your automatic responses. The habit of overcommitting can harm your relationships and your physical and mental health, including your stress level. Kemp finds that people want to please others so much that they overcommit in every venue of their lives. We say 'Yes!' to this book for anyone who needs to learn how to become comfortable saying 'no' and how to do so in a direct, gracious manner that refuses the request without rejecting the person. (By the way, if you don't need to learn this skill, you can always just say 'No!')	2005-05-10

A well-engineered and reliable kitchen appliance, say a toaster oven or a blender, has a certain functional beauty, and so does this book. Authors Mark C. Tibergien and Rebecca Pomering specifically target and serve financial advisers who own consulting firms. Based on their decades of consulting experience, the authors offer sound advice designed to protect - or deliver - any small financial service firm from a fiscal crisis. In the course of doing so, they debunk several myths, such as the notion that you can simply sell your way out of poor financial performance, or that most small firms don't need to borrow to pay for their operations. With an appendix chock full of helpful tools, such as a cash-flow calculator, a sample financial statement and a practice-management assessment questionnaire, this is a useful book for any small consultancy. We strongly recommend this book to financial advisers who know the value of good advice.	2005-05-10

As businesses adapt to rapidly evolving markets, it's difficult to think of a more vital function than project management. The ability to drive multiple projects to completion is one of the hallmarks of leading corporations. If one aspect of contemporary business science deserves elevation to a higher seat in the academy, project management is it. Successful projects reflect extremely efficient and refined planning processes, and are no more a matter of serendipity than, say, 20 straight quarters of steadily increasing profits. This compilation of valuable insight and guidance provides a single reference source for project managers. The book asserts that it is directed at project managers early in their careers and is designed to enable them to operate competently in organizations where a project management structure and legacy already exist. However, it goes into sophisticated levels of detail and the authors assume that you can juggle your jargon and your organization's politics and policies. Well-illustrated, with reader-friendly charts and a detailed appendix about critical chain project management, it provides a fundamental, thorough, all-you-need-to-know compendium for completing projects. We strongly recommend it to any project manager. The newer you are, the more you need it.	2005-05-10

As supply chains get shorter, industries are consolidating and buyers are narrowing their lists of preferred suppliers. This means that suppliers must get closer to their customers and manage their critical accounts carefully. This thorough survey of key account management outlines all of the essentials. Author Peter Cheverton provides a good overview of analytical tools, sound advice on strategy, timely warnings and even a CD with software and planning tools. Without great loss, the manuscript could have been trimmed much tighter, but the author's style is clear enough that the unnecessary material is not particularly burdensome. We highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in key corporate sales.	2005-05-10

In this history of payment cards, David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee provide an amazingly lucid account of a couple of unusual business models: the \\"two-sided platform,\\" which in the use of payment cards means walking a tightrope between the interests of merchants and consumers; and the \\"co-opetitive,\\" in which the bank members of MasterCard and Visa cooperate in developing industry practices while competing for business. The authors, who are both former Visa consultants, sound like your favorite college professors - up to date and extremely sophisticated, yet friendly and anecdotal (at one point, they describe a Shell gas station near MIT to make a point about competition among cards). They typically begin chapters with easily understood notions from which they methodically build complex structures of ideas and information. Another virtue of the book is its concreteness - although that occasionally devolves into repetitiveness - starting with an explanation involving electronic signals and following the paper path of what happens when you hand your credit, debit or charge card to a cashier. The authors even consider the design and manufacture of the cards themselves. We recommend this book as essential reading for those in the banking or payment card industries; and it's not a bad idea for card users to read it - which these days means you...and just about everyone else.	2005-05-09

Author Dan Carrison deserves credit for writing an insightful book about an ongoing modern tragedy. The Palestinian terrorist attacks, which resumed in Israel in 2000, present a critical lesson for all twenty-first century businesses. Working through terrorist attacks aimed at killing civilians and disrupting normal life actually has forced Israeli executives to learn new ways of operating their businesses. Carrison interviewed leaders in various industries (airlines, hotels, high tech, advertising) who have worked to keep their businesses open, their employees safe and their customers satisfied. He actually found that many companies were revitalized. While the topic of living with danger is daunting, many Israelis have adopted better business tactics as a result of economic and physical terrorism. Oddly enough, this extreme situation leads to an uplifting business story. As a result, we recommend this very interesting book to CEOs, business owners and corporate strategists, especially in the hospitality and service industries. It will put your troubles in perspective and will help you prepare to cope with any type of crisis.	2005-05-05

This book meets its promise of deflating the academic presentations contained in more theoretical marketing books. Too often, those books sub-divide and label marketing approaches and customer acquisition strategies into acronym-ridden codes that only confuse readers. Many of these books assume that the customer is the center of the marketing universe. Author Stephen Brown contends just the opposite. Customers are not the core of the cosmos. At best, constantly catering to their whims and changing tastes often ties marketers into unproductive knots. Using powerful - if sometimes questionable - examples, Brown shows that customers readily follow good marketing campaigns. Yet, the book relies so heavily on alliteration, puns and perky jokes that it often becomes just too cute, which impedes its solid marketing message. We recommend it as useful reading for marketing professionals who seek fresh ideas and a break from the old jargon. Alas, despite its title, no free gift comes with it, other than some razzle-dazzle marketing war stories.	2005-05-05

If Brian Tracy were your next-door neighbor, he would probably lean over the hedge to advise you on \\"The Seven Classic Laws of Hedge Trimming\\" or \\"The 12 Immutable Principles of Lawn Mowing.\\" Tracy's mind just seems to naturally work that way, absorbing valuable information on the one end and then translating it into insightful factoids on the other. This book, co-authored by Campbell Fraser, distinguishes itself by the way each brief chapter begins and ends. You start by answering one or two pointed questions about your business approach and, after reading Tracy's itemized insights, you feel charged up for the \\"application exercises\\" at the end. When Tracy writes a book, you expect every detail to be as tidy and complete as an expensive haircut; this volume does not disappoint. It is vintage Tracy. However, readers are advised this is not a book on how to coach others, but a small package of turbo-charged personal advice. We highly recommend it for anyone on a personal mission to save time, manage a staff and attain greater success.	2005-05-05

Take a deep breath and sit where the light is good as author David Zahn (who wrote this with the late Herman Holtz) attempts to describe everything about consulting in 400-plus pages of small type. The book realizes a good bit of its ambitious goal, though not without cost. Information is abundant, but not tidy. In this fourth edition, chapters pile up as the authors add coverage of new technologies to their previous reporting on older forms of media. The result is a big onion: layers and layers of information. Some are useful, topical and important; some dated, redundant or irrelevant. You can skim the parts that don't affect you, but a tougher editor would have slimmed it down and combined some basic chapters, such as the extra treatment of marketing and second careers. However, if you persist, you will garner some valuable information, especially about the competitive process of bidding for government consulting contracts. We consider this book worthwhile for those who are serious about becoming consultants. Just be diligent about ferreting out information that is pertinent to you (and bring a magnifying glass).	2005-05-02

This important book advocates an ethical way to do business and elevates \\"soft\\" concepts, such as reputation, ethics and civic responsibilities, into real factors affecting your corporate bottom line. Using fresh interpretations and real-world examples, author Kevin Jackson shows how these elements can add to or detract from a corporation's capital structure. He shares his mastery of how global corporations operate differently when they have a reputation for fairness and integrity. Jackson might challenge some management teams and boards of directors with his use of academic models, business cases and critical presentations to prove that good business behaviors and long-term profits are linked. We recommend Jackson's persuasive book to business owners, strategists, marketers and senior managers who aspire to be leaders. As this fine book very ably shows, when a company builds a great reputation, everyone benefits.	2005-05-02

Customer service is not theoretical; you want practical advice from someone with hands-on experience. Author Ari Weinzweig has the credentials to deliver first-hand advice since he actually worked at the counter of Zingerman's Delicatessen in Ann Arbor, Michigan (and is the co-founder of its group of eight businesses). We recommend this jazzy little book and the restaurant, with its good reputation and good food. It's also as expensive as any famous deli in Manhattan, which - coupled with great service - could explain how it expanded. Who can argue with success? Weinzweig's book, which is very literate despite its purple cartoons, covers the tactics he used to cultivate customers and to encourage staffers to deliver great service. He examines the obvious features of memorable service. And, in the course of retracing the basics, he often provides new insights and refreshing ideas about making customers feel special. Small business owners, service managers and human resource managers and staffers should all order a copy. Read it with a side of slaw and a big dill pickle to get the full effect.	2005-04-29

You can learn how to handle problem employees three ways: figure it out for yourself, get a great mentor or read this book. Designed primarily for managers rather than human resources professionals, it's a handy guide to different problem personalities. Author Marilyn Pincus provides several alternative solutions for how to counter each type's negative influence on your organization. Her clear writing and thoughtful organization make the book even more useful. While author Pincus doesn't provide detailed advice on the legal and procedures aspects of employment, she does tell you when the ice is getting thin enough to seek the advice of professionals. We strongly prescribe her book to help bring managerial blood pressure readings back into the normal range.	2005-04-29

This is a book very much in the tradition of Jack Schwager's Market Wizards. Like Schwager, author Michael Covel interviewed a number of great traders and attempted to capture the essence of each trader's approach to trading. The author does a good job of presenting the basics of trend following. Though much of what he says will come as no news to anyone who has read very widely in the literature of trading, his liberal quotations from other authors enliven what would otherwise be an uphill read. The author has a good eye for a snappy quote, and we believe that even if you buy this book only for the quotations, you will certainly get your money's worth. What you earn from following the trend masters' stock tips is entirely up to you.	2005-04-28

Hotelier Jonathan Tisch has little but contempt for the slash-and-burn business leaders of the '90s. Now-disgraced CEOs such as Sunbeam's Al Dunlap, Tyco's Dennis Kozlowski and Enron's Jeff Skilling embraced a new form of libertarianism, running their companies to enrich themselves. Tisch, head of the Loews Hotels chain, touts a different kind of capitalism, in which companies embrace the idea of cooperation and partnership instead of a strategy of winning at all costs. Tisch offers a compelling argument that this kinder and gentler approach is more profitable in the long run. He includes plenty of very interesting examples of partnership at his own company, although these tales can seem a bit self-serving. We recommend this intriguing title to managers who are interested in profits, but not profits at any cost.	2005-04-27

This is a solidly written, clear and comprehensive guide to leading teams. Author Gregory E. Huszczo touches on almost every subject a team leader needs to know - what skills are necessary, how you develop them, how you build teams, what you do when conflict erupts and so on. This book is an excellent introduction to team building for someone newly assigned to a team. It also offers important advice for executives of companies that are considering a team approach to management. The style is clear and straightforward, but quite academic. The author cites research and evidence to back his assertions, but he does not provide much in the way of entertainment. We find that those who like to swallow their management lore straight from the bottle will savor this book; those who prefer to mix it with anecdotes may wish to imbibe elsewhere.	2005-04-26

Writing a response to a Request for Proposal (RFP) may seem just like any other writing project, unless you know how technical and demanding the process can be. Successful proposals require a deliberate focused effort, especially when winning or losing a bid can mean corporate success or financial doom. Authors David G. Pugh and Terry R. Bacon do a solid job of presenting the challenges and processes involved in drafting winning proposals. They explain what happens before and after a proposal is submitted and even provide excerpts from winning proposals, timetables, review questions and team task assignments. The material is so solid that you'll wish for more war stories, but that omission does not detract from this valuable book. We highly recommend it and find it very useful for people and teams who want to write proposals that bring home the Bacon (and Pugh).	2005-04-26

This is a timely book about a huge, unchangeable natural event: the demographic shift. Nothing can turn back the clock or change the direction of a demographic wave. Author Robert K. Critchley is well armed with age data to make a powerful case that there will be a worldwide labor shortage, but corporate CEO and human resources (HR) people are doing little to prepare for this massive change in labor management. To prepare for the inevitable labor force shift, companies should recruit and encourage older (50 plus) employees to remain on the job. Downsizing and outsourcing are shortsighted knee-jerk reactions to this looming problem and will not strengthen corporations for the inevitable. Companies that really believe that people are their best asset must develop effective human resources programs that actually do employees some good. That's why we think this is crucial reading for HR executives and CEOs. It's a reminder that time stops for no corporation, and that the people who work for you, even if they are getting a little gray, are going to be tough to replace - so you may want to keep them around.	2005-04-26

Although confrontation is difficult for many people, it is often necessary. Failure to confront someone over bad behavior may be misinterpreted as approval. Confrontations can help bring people back to a better, more productive course. However, confrontations also can go off track and become shouting matches (or worse). Authors Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan and Al Switzler outline a method for approaching confrontations when the stakes are particularly high; those are the crucial confrontations. Boiled down to its essentials, the methodology consists of focusing on facts, remaining calm, listening to the other person with respect and working to motivate the other person and to enable a change in behavior. The book is light, anecdotal and easy to read. Yet, we find that it offers so much sound advice that any manager, parent or spouse could find something useful.	2005-04-25

Outsourcing has become an accepted business practice because it can deliver demonstrable savings and improved services. However, while sales outsourcing is common, it has not been widely adopted by companies accustomed to having dedicated in-house sales staffs. Authors Erin Anderson and Bob Trinkle make a powerful case for the benefits of using outside sales reps, asserting that they cost less and sell more, particularly when they use the tactic of \\"portfolio selling.\\" The authors explain how the two types of sales forces can co-exist and augment each other. Die-hard sales managers will find interesting material here, though the book belabors a few obvious points and lacks enough real-world examples to juice up the dry text. The authors include a CD with software for analyzing sales costs. Since this is a very specific book for anyone investigating whether to use reps, we recommend it to sales directors and executives who are facing that question. However, front line salespeople and reps should just keep to their appointment books - this text is not designed for you.	2005-04-25

Readers instinctively understand that every topic is not equally adaptable to narrative treatment. You could read about Tiger Woods for a month, for example, and not improve your golf game by a stroke. In promotional marketing, however, the opposite is true. The marketer's tool kit only holds so many tricks, and many are careworn from repetitive use. That means you can learn tons about executing a sales promotion by reading a book, if you find the right one. Good news: this is that tome. Combining their many years of experience, Steve Smith and Don E. Schultz adroitly blend the practical with the strategic. Their book is packed with budget tips, planning advice and execution checklists. We recommend this comprehensive, insightful review even for battle-scarred veterans of the promotional wars. For new arrivals, here's the marketer's promo tool kit, ready to go.	2005-04-25

Author Joachim B&uuml;schken adeptly presents a different form of pricing strategy based on making it more expensive for customers to switch from your product to a new one, even if your product fails them. This concept, called \\"customer lock-in,\\" entails charging such high \\"switching costs\\" for changing vendors that customers are stuck. It means that consumers who buy deficient software or earn frequent flier miles on a chronically tardy airline are reluctant to change because switching is a big nuisance or too expensive. While your business may not embrace this idea, some hardware (Hewlett-Packard) and software (Microsoft) companies use it to great advantage. To his credit, B&uuml;schken has a short section on the ethics of lock-in. He concludes that it is ethically okay given disclosure, though you may want to have a deeper discussion. While the writing can be repetitive and dry, we find that this is a rare book on a sensitive topic. We recommend it to marketers and product strategists who want to learn more about this little-known, potentially controversial pricing practice. It is also a pretty good eye-opener for consumers; customer lock-in takes 'caveat emptor'  to new heights (or depths).	2005-04-22

Stephan Schiffman is a storied veteran in the field of corporate sales training. His book offers many useful tools, including a test to determine if you're suffering from burnout, a myriad of tips on selling more effectively (Shiffman's foremost area of expertise) and an appendix with advice for telemarketing sales operations. Schiffman includes scores of anti-burnout measures, ranging from diet to managing expectations to transforming stress into creative energy. Most chapters are only two to three pages long, which makes this book read at a practical pace for busy professionals, including sales managers, an audience Schiffman specifically addresses. His advice on burnout is sound and well founded, if not nearly as brilliant as his advice on the selling process itself. We recommend this book, although its impact on you will depend on your stress level, experience, personality and job circumstances. The section on how managers can minimize burnout will help you even before your team members get their copies. Reading this book may not prevent burnout, but at least you'll know how to douse it.	2005-04-20

Szabo presents a balanced if subjective look at the factors leading to the rift between Washington and Berlin over Iraq. He adroitly portrays how Sept. 11, 2001, was the shotgun in the marriage between U.S. conservative nationalists (Bush, Vice President Richard Cheney) and neo-conservatives (Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Pearl). The neo-cons seek to ensure American security by spreading democracy to every inch of the globe. Szabo ably profiles the historical and cultural circumstances that contributed to the German perception that Bush is a greater threat to world peace than Saddam Hussein. He also uncovers the underlying geopolitical fault lines causing the diplomatic temblors that are rattling the dishware on both sides of the Atlantic. His book is an excellent tactical portrayal of how a vital, longstanding diplomatic relationship can disappear virtually overnight. We strongly recommend this volume to any serious student of international relations, the Atlantic Alliance and the Bush Administration, particularly in regard to its response to 9/11.	2005-04-19

Haneberg helpfully explains specific ways to be more productive and offers techniques to help your employees become focused, fulfilled and fruitful. Her energetic book codifies the steps you should take to grow into middle management, shine and advance to upper management. Along the way, you'll learn how to improve your organization, identify trouble spots and implement changes in your corporate culture. We can envision this book as a part of a college management curriculum or of any firm's ongoing middle management development program. It's practical, lively and thorough. If you want to be sure you've got a good grip on management from the middle, read on.	2005-04-18

Author and executive Margaret Heffernan fearlessly declares that decades of advice telling business women to act like men, follow traditional rules and cleave to heartless stereotypes are wrong. Breathe a sigh of relief. It's not you; \\"It's the system, stupid!\\" In her eyes, the business world inherently does not welcome, respect or value women. Refreshingly, instead of blaming women, the author conveys the advice of hundreds of female survey respondents who say men hold the aces in the business world and don't want to share. Honest, funny and sometimes disconcerting, she offers advice, inspiring examples and helpful stories. She explains how to find or create a humane, cooperative, supportive workplace that fits your principles - and how to make a realistic appraisal if you are at the change-it-or-quit stage. The one shortcoming is the author's absolute unstated assumption that women are innately, inevitably more cooperative, honest and caring than men. This stereotype is a two-edged sword, wounding those men who do have sound values, and reinforcing the typecasting that women ought to be sweet and nurturing because it's in their genes. That aside, we recommend Heffernan's clear view of the hurdles that block a woman's path to business success and work-life balance. She confronts painful realities and adapts them, or adapts to them, even if in nontraditional ways. If you have to be one person at work and someone different at home, her dynamic vision can help you pull it all together.	2005-04-18

If you wonder why all those superstar CEOs suddenly veered off course, executive coaches David L. Dotlich and Peter C. Cairo offer an engaging work of psychoanalysis to answer your question. Leadership failures can result from 11 character traits, either deep-seated personality faults or qualities that once were beneficial but became problematic. The authors offer recognizable case studies and specific advice to bolster their case that these flaws derail leaders. The culprit characteristics can seem a bit general, an inevitable concern in a book seeking simple explanations for human folly. We recommend this easy-to-digest volume to leaders and those who endure them. This is just the ticket for bosses who want to address their possible personality pitfalls before they commit career suicide.	2005-04-13

Compiled by Louis Crosier and written by a group of investment and other financial advisors, each of whom contributed a chapter, this book thoroughly addresses every important question involved in the sale of a business, except the matter of finding a buyer. It focuses on financial planning, so the information on insurance, taxes, negotiations, deal structuring and the like is comprehensive and detailed. One of the more interesting chapters, however, addresses the emotional consequences of a windfall of cash. It turns out that the ancient sages were right: money doesn't solve problems; it just substitutes new problems for old ones. We recommend this book to those who are considering selling their businesses. For readers who may have to embark on the problem-plagued life of a wealthy ex-entrepreneur, this book is a useful (although a rather dry) guide.	2005-04-13

Psychologist Hendrie Weisinger has written an interesting short book that applies the fundamental concepts of emotional intelligence to the work of being a financial advisor, although some of the advice might apply to many other professional roles. The author avoids academic psychobabble, and presents ideas and techniques that financial advisors (and others) can adapt to their everyday work lives. Whether professionals can fundamentally alter their behavior simply by reading a book remains to be seen, but the author tries to put that goal in reach by presenting reasonable, sound ways to apply his advice. His terminology and counsel are engaging, though not novel. How much you learn probably depends on how committed you are to mastering your emotional reactions. Can you remain focused through difficult times? Do you deal well with irate clients? Do you respond productively to criticism? Are your interoffice relationships cordial and fruitful? Can you turn setbacks into comebacks? Do you stay motivated over the long haul? This book can help you answer those questions positively, so we recommend it highly to those financial advisors who are not already familiar with this level of motivational literature. Most likely, just reading it is a sign of emotional intelligence.	2005-04-12

It would be a mistake to emphasize the word \\"cash\\" in this book's ambivalent title without giving equal weight to the word that follows, \\"nexus.\\" A nexus is the bond between two disparate things and, indeed, this is a book about the intersection of power and money. Its thesis, to the frustration of economic determinists everywhere, is that while money matters, other things matter more, at least when it comes to the cultural chessboard of international politics. One might quibble that author Niall Ferguson underemphasizes the extent to which competition for economically vital scarce resources leads to war. The other caveat is that he refers to the U.S.'s reluctance to go to war with a pre-Iraq state of mind. Yet, the author is an accomplished historian who capably supports his arguments. He manages overall to portray economic history in all its rich nuance, detail and complexity. His premise that war, not economics or politics, is the great engine that has driven the evolution of the modern welfare state is as enlightening as it is chilling. We highly recommend this book to the lay reader with a developed interest in history, politics and, especially, economics. However, a warning is in order: Those who only read the headlines may find this just a little too deep.	2005-04-12

As he teaches women (and men, we suppose) tactics for bagging bigger bucks, he says that men earn more because women have a tendency - or perhaps a biological instinct - to prioritize family over career. Thus, Farrell maintains, women work shorter hours, take more parental leave, and are less productive, less well trained and less committed. If you are a male who has prioritized hearth and home, perhaps you have made some of the same choices that Farrell says cost women higher salaries. The book is full of footnotes, charts, graphs and sidebars, as Farrell cites U.S. Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics data (as well as, occasionally, himself). However, his analysis of the numbers usually hinges more on single studies or interviews, personal experiences, newspaper articles and conversations than on historic, social or economic trends that offer deeper explanations. Farrell outlines some real factors - danger, discomfort, late hours and heavy lifting - which increase the pay for certain jobs. He tells women that they can earn more by entering nontraditional fields. We recommend this book primarily for readers at the start of their careers or in the midst of transitions where lifestyle and financial considerations compete. Though the information about salary-based job searching is practical, if you see the world through egalitarian or feminist lenses, you may find yourself getting a little testy.	2005-04-12

Parsons strives to bridge the gap between teaching the ethics of public relations and offering ethical advice to professionals, but unfortunately her bridge only goes halfway. It's strong up to the point where she outlines the philosophical issues involved in the ethical treatment of people in business. She could have maintained her momentum by supplying real-world insights about the PR practitioners' ethical breaches or the intentional distrust that dishonest PR creates. Some of her examples seem to come from Web sites or magazines, while others don't seem on point or particularly ethically challenging. For instance, she cites one ethical dilemma about reporters who were invited to a university's holiday party and she asks whether the event constituted a gift or \\"subtle bribery.\\" Maybe it was both, or maybe it was just a place to get a free beer. Parsons falls into a trap that often ensnares books on ethics: her treatise just doesn't provide enough substance. That said, her topic is important in today's scandal-scarred business environment, and she raises several worthwhile issues. We recommend this book to PR practitioners and marketing teachers who seek background on this inside-the-industry topic.	2005-04-12

Every few hundred years, the Western world takes itself apart and puts itself together again. Peter Drucker observed that this process of dissolution and reconstitution occurs so decisively that, afterward, people who live in the new world cannot even imagine the world of their parents or grandparents. Author Mary O'Hara-Devereaux believes that we are about three-quarters through a 75-year period of such disruptive innovation. She calls the transition \\"the Badlands.\\" Like the barren Dakota Badlands of the Old West, they are a painful trial that makes or breaks people, and either way leaves them with a new sense of identity. The author identifies several distinct transitional pains for which she prescribes an equal number of palliatives. Her analyses and prescriptions can be thought provoking, though they are seldom trail blazing. While the book may be more smoke than fire, we find that smoke signals can be useful for the long-range vistas in the Badlands. (And, by the way, the author includes a chapter on China that seems almost as parenthetical as this sentence, though interesting enough. In reality, China looks like the pivot point of Badlands transitions, and how it comes through may affect how your neighborhood comes through, as well.)	2005-04-11

Laudicina invites you to, \\"Come and look into my crystal ball!\\" His book, largely based on the research and insights of A.T. Kearney's prestigious Global Business Policy Council, casts a wide net of future possibilities. After you put it down, you may feel its conclusions could best be summarized with a shrug and a muttered, \\"Who knows?\\" To say that five factors - globalization, demographics, consumers' needs, natural resource limitations, and governmental regulation - will be the primary influences on future world markets is well and good, but what will their impact be? Given the variety of future scenarios here, you may be tempted to resort to John Maynard Keynes' attitude that, \\"In the long run, we're all dead.\\" Be that as it may, Laudicina proves that any astute portrayal of future possibilities must reflect multiple, complex uncertainties. In this rapidly changing world, companies have a profound need to consider what may lie ahead. This volume should provide substantial assistance. We strongly recommend it to corporate leaders, business prognosticators and futurists of every ilk.	2005-04-11

Many soothsayers pontificate sonorously about leadership to anyone who will listen, but over time they gradually lose touch with their subject matter. You may at first wonder if best-selling guru Marcus Buckingham has stumbled into this very ditch after he devotes eight pages early in the book to what makes great marriages (FYI: he says it's always interpreting everything your spouse does in the warmest possible light, whether or not that is logical). Well, not to worry - Buckingham is just warming up. An original thinker who lets his intellect roam, he brings sharp insights to the evergreen topic of leadership. Although this book is essentially creative in nature rather than intellectually rigorous, you'll come to respect the powerful perceptions it has to offer. Buckingham must navigate a perilous balance between clarity and oversimplification, and he pulls it off rather well. While we wouldn't say this is the only book you need to read to understand leadership, we highly recommend it.	2005-04-11

If you go around humming, \\"If I were a rich man\\" from \\"Fiddler on the Roof\\", it might be time to stop fiddling and go around reading instead. If wealth is your goal, man or woman, help yourself to a serving of some vintage Brian Tracy advice. He offers a tasty stew of maxims, aphorisms, anecdotes and general words of wisdom that will motivate you to become better at what you do, in order to become richer. Tracy is a walking oracle of motivation. If your desire to be wealthy seems like a pipe dream, wake up to the blend of information he has assembled. As the master of self-help books, Tracy offers practical advice, encouragement, motivation and effective techniques for self-improvement. In this book, he tells you how to help yourself to money. That's as good an invitation as we've seen anywhere. Now let's see if it works. In high hopes, we recommend Tracy's application of upbeat philosophy to the goal of accumulating wealth.	2005-04-11

To discuss how your company can create value, authors Erik Stern and Mike Hutchinson first offer a gloss on financial issues beginning with the basics. The book's point of departure is a presentation of core knowledge about efficient markets, shareholder value creation and the motivational use of compensation. The authors' primary business in the first half of the book is recapping these foundation issues in a digressive style replete with tangents and asides. In the second half of the book, they offer a stew of recommendations and suggestions that range from how to build value in your company to how government should increase overall value creation. The authors' opinions are plain, although some of their interpretations of history and finance may be open to debate. Stern created the Wealth Added Index (WAI), which measures value. He and his co-author now step forward with their explanation of how to create lasting value. The presentation is weakened by their scattered approach, but we agree with their contention that any individual can build value and appreciate their case histories. Overall, the book is better suited for those who need an overview of the basics, rather than those seeking an advanced perspective on value creation.	2005-04-11

Most books on energy proceed with all the plodding predictability of an oil station pumping up and down in the middle of Nowhere, Texas: There's only so much oil, it's being consumed faster and faster, so someday the spigot must squeak dry. Authors and contrarians Peter W. Huber and Mark P. Mills stand up in the court of global opinion to pound loudly on the oil drum of iconoclasm. The question before the world jury: Is this a work of genius, or a perfect illustration of the fact that some energy is indeed wasted? This book reflects diligent-if-tendentious research and unapologetically advances highly unpopular, and potentially inaccurate, theories. These include the notion that making industrial processes more energy efficient results in increased consumption. It asserts that energy development is a perpetual motion machine that rewards increased consumption with ever-expanding supplies, and that wasting energy is both inevitable and virtuous, as it leads ultimately to greater supply and production. This last notion is not so far-fetched in light of nuclear fusion and the ongoing convergence of digital and genetic technologies. We  recommend this unique perspective to those interested in a different take on the world's sustainability dilemma. If nothing else, it will give you something extremely controversial to read while the jury is still out.	2005-04-08

Author Marlene Caroselli accompanies her valuable handbook on the basics of leadership with insightful quotations and anecdotes. \\"Basic\\" is the operative word here. The book makes no pretense, for example, of delving into the theoretical side of leadership development. Nor does it prepare managers for specific business tasks that they're more likely to encounter as leaders, such as budgeting and strategic planning. Rather, this book is specifically tailored for current managers who have leadership ambitions, and for newly minted leaders who need a little expertise to seize control of their new roles. We recommend it as a solid menu option with lots of good advice for that eager-to-lead audience. The book is thoroughly crafted to achieve its purpose, though more experienced readers may find themselves asking, \\"Where's the gravy?\\"	2005-04-04

Authors and reengineering consultants Michael Hammer and James Champy begin their book rather defensively by insisting that reengineering is not merely a forgotten fad of the 1990s. And they may be right, particularly given their insistence that companies must be totally, absolutely willing to discard the old and replace it with the new. The authors make dramatic claims for the potential of reengineering, and highlight interesting victories - such as Kodak, a company rarely cited as an example of success. The book presents reengineering as a simple, straightforward way to view business processes, figure out how to make them more rational and economical, and then implement necessary changes. The authors made a splash by labeling this approach as reengineering in the 1990s. The term became a euphemism for firing people in droves, then fell into discredit. This update may be intended to rescue the concept from its bad image, but it doesn't quite succeed. In the new millennium, companies deal with complex, costly processes by outsourcing them, yet the word \\"outsourcing\\" does not yet appear in this book's index. Such time lags aside, we find this business landmark well worth reading. After all, it's the management Bible of the '90s. Many of its hoary old verities still have the ring of truth.	2005-04-01

Author Hedieh Nasheri suggests that if James Bond were alive and well, he probably would be pounding a keyboard somewhere. Her book consists of an entertaining review of historic case studies of computer crimes and industrial spying, plus an examination of the laws that nations have passed in an attempt to stem the leaky tide of outgoing information. The book defines the magnitude of the problem and pounds the drums for greater international cooperation on security and protection of intellectual property, but it is short on real solutions. And who can blame Nasheri? When countries such as China and France bug airplane seats, break into hotel rooms, pilfer attach&eacute; cases and pay cash for pirated industrial secrets, why delve into international policing? We believe that reading this book is a sound place to start deepening the business community's education about this escalating problem.	2005-04-01

Marketing experts Clive Humby and Terry Hunt and journalist Tim Phillips explain how British grocer Tesco collected, analyzed and used customer data to become a retail giant. Tesco paired its Clubcard loyalty scheme with jazzy information technology (IT) to set a new standard for knowing your customer. Humby and Hunt, as the collaborators behind Tesco's data-driven transformation, focus on praise, but they don't hide Tesco's early mistakes or skimp on its strategic hand-wringing. Though somewhat dryly written, the book compellingly discusses aspects of loyalty programs that don't get much ink outside the retail trade press. For example, it covers the way Tesco's accumulation of rich customer data forced some painful changes in its corporate culture. The authors also serve a sampling of delicious anecdotes and share Tesco's early difficulty with getting some customers - chiefly students - to join Clubcard. Tesco once gave students at a Q&A focus group some complimentary wine and cheese only to find that they \\"swiftly drank so much wine that they made little sense to anyone still sober.\\" The book shines when discussing such early efforts by Tesco to micro-segment customers by lifestyle habits, including trying to glean individual personality traits from the contents of each grocery cart. We recommend this case study both as the story of Tesco's gutsy, groundbreaking experiment with IT and as a textbook example of how the Digital Age keeps making it possible for smart, daring businesspeople to rewrite the rules of commerce.	2005-03-31

Credit author Paul Seabright's achievement on several scores. First, he is an economist who thinks outside the supply-and-demand box, and whose thoughts actually are comprehensible to the average reader. Second, his ideas are original, blending evolution, economics and sociology. In his view, the daily trusting interaction of complete strangers is a marvel that is unprecedented in the animal kingdom. Moreover, this high degree of non-familial social cooperation has only arisen in the past 10,000 years or so, despite the six to seven-million-year existence of 'Homo sapiens'. Although the average businessperson probably has no direct application for Seabright's book, it's interesting, worthwhile reading anyway. In a world where the need for global cooperation is greater, and its existence more fragile, we recommend this book for its unique, valuable perspective.	2005-03-30

This book is a series of short essays about the elements that contribute to good advertising. The 22 \\"laws\\" are really not laws at all. Each one is an informative, inspirational article about a particular point in advertising's creative or management process. Separate contributors wrote each of the 22 \\"laws.\\" Author Michael Newman identifies each writer as an accomplished ad industry pro. As a result, this book offers some good examples of ads from a worldwide perspective, which is especially important since the industry seems to be floundering globally. The essays are short, often interesting, but sometimes unevenly focused. Some contributors took their assignment more seriously than others did, and a few should never have even made it into the book. But we think most advertising professionals will find something inspirational here.	2005-03-30

Mark and Barbara Stefik's guide to innovation is based on their belief that the new century demands that business foster inventive strategies. The authors tell inventors, entrepreneurs and managers what they can and must do to achieve breakthrough innovations. They explain the basis for innovation, the context of invention and what breakthroughs mean in terms of business strategy for the twenty-first century. The authors based their research on interviews with inventors and managers, including many from the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Their book is thorough, clearly written and packed with anecdotes, although at times it suffers from erratic organization. We find that the authors do a very good job of introducing the elements of innovation to a general business readership.	2005-03-24

Most books about developing effective persuasive techniques are based on traditional debate methods and on fine-tuning ethos, logos and pathos to convince people to do things your way. Authors Joel Bauer and Mark Levy acknowledge the benefits of earlier approaches, but entertainment and fun are their attention getters of choice. The authors advocate \\"infotainment,\\" adapting pitching techniques used by flamboyant non-business people, such as gamblers, carnival barkers and magicians. They may have a point. Some of their techniques, including the use of tricks and props, might help you seize an audience. (Warning for the fumble-fingered, some of these magic tricks literally require sleight-of-hand practice.) Determining if these games would work in most traditional corporate settings, or on a repeated basis, is another question. We recommend this book to particularly adventurous marketing and sales presenters. Only certifiable extroverts need apply.	2005-03-24

This is a stirring polemic by Lou Dobbs, an unlikely crusader against free trade. As a television anchor, business journalist and publisher of an investment newsletter, Dobbs has credentials that might lead you to expect him to cheer for unimpeded capitalism. But Dobbs delivers, instead, an indictment of free trade replete with charges of \\"corporate greed.\\" At times, his book reads like just another rant by just another economically naïve protester railing against the machinery of capitalism. But Dobbs ultimately delivers more than slogans. He backs his indictments with evidence. He shows, for example, how the U.S. tax code's treatment of transfer pricing encourages outsourcing of jobs. In a `tour de force' of communication, Dobbs manages to make such arcane facts of financial life interesting and accessible to the average reader. We highly recommend his book to those affected by, or participating in, outsourcing.	2005-03-23

Author Erik Granered makes a sincere effort to bridge the gap between two distinct bodies of business expertise: what it takes to establish an offshore outsourcing endeavor, and what it takes to operate a successful call center. This is a unique volume because it appeals to the strategic concerns of both corporate decision-makers and call center executives on the front lines. Overall, however, Granered focuses more on practical applications than on strategic issues. He acknowledges correctly that his treatment of broad cultural issues may sometimes sound simplistic. Even so, we find his book a useful addition to any library on offshore outsourcing, and strongly recommend it to managers and executives who are interested in outsourcing or call centers, or both.	2005-03-23

Author John Yokoyama, owner of Seattle's World Famous Pike Place Fish Market, explains how he changed his attitude toward his employees, embraced a new way of treating people, led his employees in a fundamental directional shift and built a widespread reputation. This isn't a business \\"cookbook\\" that tells you step by step what to do. As Yokoyama insists, you can't just copy someone else's success. You must be an individual. However, the story of his turnaround and triumph at World Famous Pike Place Fish Market is a good read that illuminates the need for leaders to treat their employees, as he says, as people, not as human resources. Although the Market is getting to be as overexposed as a fish left out in the sun, we welcome this first person exposition from the owner. After numerous published accounts about the Market, the saga of how Yokoyama empowered employees, promoted his business and changed his style comes through best in his own words.	2005-03-23

Women are the most powerful consumer force in the U.S., but they do not approach buying decisions the way men do. That's intriguing, but it doesn't mean that exhaustive demographic and sales statistics make interesting reading. Authors and marketing consultants Lisa Johnson and Andrea Learned explain how to direct your marketing efforts to women. Each chapter deals with a different subset of women - old, young, black, white, Hispanic, married, single - but the groups are compared along similar lines and the information is sliced the same way in most chapters. The authors liven up their exposition with short illustrative case studies, but the cases often feature products for which marketers have made no concerted, specific effort to attract female buyers. For instance, the decision to sell single servings of food occurred because of other demographics (more people living alone) and was not intended just to attract women buyers. Still, the thesis here is important enough to carry the authors' occasional tendency to twist product features to fit the theme, as well as their branding jargon. Acknowledging the significance of marketing to women, we recommend this information-packed book.	2005-03-22

Retired four-star general and former Secretary of State Colin Powell is considered one of the most respected leaders in the U.S. Author Oren Harari's short book distills Powell's insights about leadership. As a formidable leader who has managed battles, bureaucracies and humanitarian missions, Powell has firm ideas about how a good leader behaves. Refreshingly, some of his principles are modestly anti-authoritarian. However, Harari does not develop Powell's background or explain how he implemented these principles during his long, varied career. Like the rules promulgated in similar books on leadership, many of these \\"lessons\\" seem arbitrary and redundant. Then again, it is interesting and useful to see how a leader of Powell's caliber thinks. Truncated as it may be, we recommend this short, concise collection to aspiring leaders. It is just about enough reading material for a short plane ride, but it provides a fair share of inspiration.	2005-03-21

Schumpeter's keen intellect makes some of today's scholarship sound like the spouting of ideology on talk shows. Some consider him the greatest economist of the twentieth century. Only an intellect of his towering stature would be able to present a case that while Marx was wrong about how capitalism would collapse, he was probably correct that it eventually would. Schumpeter also contends that socialism may eclipse free-market economies, news he feels society should greet with angst. He believed that capitalism's doom would proceed not from a revolution by an angry proletariat, but rather as a result of successes that would give rise to a class of elites who would gradually institute systems of central control. Fully understanding this complex, although non-mathematical, treatise may require some background; it is not a book for the novice. While this 1942 classic may seem dated in spots, those who conclude that it is time to tap dance on socialism's grave should consider that Schumpeter expected socialism's dominance to take a century or more. We recommend this classic to anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the historic, economic case for the rise of socialism.	2005-03-21

Six Sigma books often couch their wisdom in acronyms or jargon, or they offer vague, unfulfilling anecdotal narratives. This book is different. As trim, focused and efficient as if a Six Sigma team had designed it, it gets the job done. Its mission is simple: explain the basic structure of Lean Six Sigma initiatives to readers who are likely to become involved in one. While select case studies are judiciously sprinkled throughout, this is a meat-and-potatoes book that tells you what you need to know in clear, straightforward prose. Although the authors - Mike George, Dave Rowlands and Bill Kastle - humbly issue the caveat that this is not intended to be a comprehensive reference, its terse yet relevant style will probably make it one of those dog-eared volumes that barely gets back to the HR bookshelf before it's checked out again. Because of its plainspoken functionality, we recommend this manual strongly to anyone whose future may involve Lean Six Sigma.	2005-03-18

So often in corporate life, profit is generated when you learn how to have your cake and eat it, too. Well, pick up a fork. Author Michael L. George shows you how to apply both Lean and Six Sigma to your service operation so you can accomplish goals you may have thought were mutually exclusive: work faster and increase quality. A Lean Six Sigma expert, the author deftly explains how most service operations are sitting on a potential treasure trove of cost savings. He uses real-world case studies involving the likes of Lockheed Martin and Bank One. The key to the cake cupboard, however, is listening to the voice of your customers and faithfully addressing their perspective about your service. We highly recommend this comprehensive volume to any service organization that wants to become simultaneously leaner, better and friendlier in the eyes of its customers.	2005-03-17

From your morning commute to your late-afternoon coffee break, your daily travel through time may be filled with costly detours and countless obstacles. Are your days typically disrupted by disorganization and delays? Do you spin your wheels on the dirt paths of life? Fortunately, Brian Tracy offers a concise map around the daily roadblocks. His text provides a toolbox of effective time-management techniques, ranging from New Age-style visualizations (\\"mental rehearsals\\") to concrete 15-minute planning blocks. Tracy provides solutions for reprogramming a self-defeating subconscious and for retooling aimless corporate meetings. He suggests useful exercises and summaries, including action steps at the end of each chapter. Tracy apparently designed the book in a way that enables you to digest individual chapters as self-contained units. For this reason, it has redundancies, but this weakness is also a strength. Through repetition, Tracy really drives home important time-saving concepts. We recommend this highly useful, highly applicable anti-time-theft device to road weary executives and staff members who are lost in space and time. This book is a keeper for ongoing renewal.	2005-03-16

Business schools and shareholders focus so relentlessly on hard numbers and cold facts that it's no surprise that data reigns supreme in the corporate world. But executives who downplay the importance of emotion and intuition do so at their own peril, management expert Manfred Kets de Vries convincingly argues. He offers a wealth of useful tips for leaders who are ready to reintroduce the human side, the soft side, to their organizations and their own lives. The author occasionally drops in stories and quotes from his clients, but his argument would have been bolstered by even more examples. We recommend this easy-to-digest volume to leaders who want to improve their interpersonal skills.	2005-03-16

This layman's guide to the emotions is a delightful walking tour through the gardens of philosophy, psychology and neuroscience, not to mention popular culture. Author Dylan Evans proposes the thesis that emotions are an evolutionary necessity that plays an important role in ensuring human survival. He demonstrates his thesis with anecdotes and illustrations. Though it delivers some intellectually rigorous material, this is not an intellectually rigorous book. It is more of a long, agreeable, rambling monologue. We highly recommend it to those who would read it primarily for pleasure, and secondarily suggest it as a useful overview of the evolutionary role of emotions. Its ample bibliography can guide those who are interested in exploring the subject in greater depth.	2005-03-15

Human resources professionals will find Michael Armstrong's book practical, helpful and relevant. It discusses all facets of current practice, including such relatively new developments as e-learning and recruiting, and it discusses how you can help your organization implement change. The book would make an excellent college text, since it covers HRM's evolution, principles, theories, practice, research, job descriptions and more. The author seems to have two goals: to provide comprehensive information about human resource management and to persuade upper level managers to integrate HRM into strategic planning. This would empower HR departments to generate broader organizational results. To get the most from this manual, given its textbook style, practitioners may wish to study it chapter by chapter. Since organizational philosophies, functions and practices differ, it even lends itself to further discussion when HRM professionals gather to share ideas and swap proven practices. We think those in the field will derive a great deal of value from this book.	2005-03-15

Advanced projects are particularly demanding because of their complexity, novelty, scale, scope, cost and logistics. Author Alan D. Orr provides a detailed and useful guide to every step of advanced project management. He leaves nothing to chance or to the imagination. The charts and spreadsheets he recommends are clearly appropriate to the purpose, and his outline of project management questions, planning milestones, team building methods and tracking tools are clear and to the point. This book belongs on the shelf of anyone managing a complex project for the first time. We believe even a seasoned project manager would find it useful.	2005-03-14

Authors David L. Dotlich, James L. Noel and Norman Walker connect the growing body of work about the emotional intelligence of leaders with the practice of executive coaching and leadership development. Where does emotional intelligence come from, and how can you stimulate its development in the next generation of leaders? The authors' answer is that growth is indivisible from pain and change. Any great leader fights personal and professional battles, and earns a few scars. The bottom line: what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. For individual leaders-in-training, the question is how to grow after being hit by life's curveballs. For firms, the question is how to incorporate executives' personal lives and career setbacks into their development as leaders. In this regard, the book bridges a gap in executive development literature. We very highly recommend it to those experiencing difficult transitions, and to human resource and development professionals.	2005-03-14

Author Gerry McCusker recites a litany of public relations mistakes made by major corporations worldwide. Each mistake is encapsulated in a short chapter, only two to four pages, followed by a \\"Lessons Learnt\\" summary that serves as practical advice to PR people. Unfortunately, this choppy format makes the book read more like an encyclopedia or a depository of yarns from years of index cards rather than a cohesive work. It is organized only by an arbitrary alphabetical listing, and the jargon used (\\"journo,\\" \\"bods,\\" \\"squillions\\") may not translate well with U.S. audiences. However, the book has two big redeeming factors. First, it provides a global view of how major PR firms, such as Burson-Marsteller and Hill & Knowlton, and other corporations operate outside the U.S., often apparently at much lower standards than they use domestically. Secondly, the PR mistakes in this litany drive home the importance of basic common sense. They show how individuals can foster or destroy corporate good will. We can imagine PR professionals flipping through these war stories for entertainment and for warnings about disasters to avoid.	2005-03-14

Author Ray Salemi's neat little book offers excellent advice on how to get through \\"the worst of times.\\" Management treads thin ice after layoffs. Everyone is sensitive and even the smallest error in dealing with colleagues can be magnified. When productivity drops, frustration naturally sets in. Salemi points out the most serious land mines managers should avoid. He focuses on the needs of mid-level managers and project team leaders, rather than those higher up the executive food chain. The book's advice, while sometimes basic, will substantially bolster the emotional intelligence quotient of the average manager coping with the awkward post-layoff period. We strongly recommend this book to managers who have avoided the layoff purge and now need to rally the stunned survivors.	2005-03-14

Author Alex Pattakos draws on his own experiences, TV sitcoms and, primarily, \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" by Viktor Frankl to convey the idea that it is up to you to find meaning in your life and work. Pattakos includes exercises from his own coaching practice and some other widely used techniques (such as writing your own obituary) to help readers focus on the most meaningful elements of their lives. His book brings Frankl's ideas to bear at the office, through such concepts as imbue your work with meaning, chose your own attitude and reach beyond yourself. While this may remind you of supportive guidance you have heard before (perhaps better stated), we find that it may provide tools for seeking purpose in your daily life. Pattakos' book is useful, supportive and readable. If nothing else, it might encourage those who are unfamiliar with Viktor Frankl to read his work. He is the philosophical parent of this and many other such books.	2005-03-10

Investment firms confront a world of change. Yet many of them have managerial cultures that are ill suited for that confrontation. Author Jim Ware, writing with Beth Michaels and Dale Primer, exposes 10 myths of investment firm management, and shows managers what it takes to build a strong, successful management culture. The authors seem generous and humble, drawing examples from and crediting the work of numerous management authorities. The book does not break new ground, but rather it summarizes, compiles and restates what has been said elsewhere. The authors' approach is frank, straightforward and anecdotal. Their focus on the book's target market - investment firm managers - is tight and unvarying. Only in the last chapter do they stray from that focus, restating a number of criteria that investors might use to evaluate stocks on the basis of corporate culture. One suspects that the authors might have included this chapter at the urging of an editor eager to expand, if only incrementally, the readership for the book. If so, we believe the editor should have been content with how precisely the book serves its intended audience.	2005-03-10

Wegner's book is a lucid, entertaining exploration of one of the most important issues in philosophy and psychology: the existence of will. Extreme determinists contend that people are mechanisms programmed to do what they do and that any notion of freedom or choice is merely illusory. Their antagonists, the proponents of free will, say that people consciously freely choose to act (at least some of the time). Wegner falls into the former camp. Conscious will, he says, is an illusion. But in a wide-ranging ramble that touches on law and the courts, spirit possession, hypnotism, neuroscience, phantom limbs and Ouija boards among other things, he builds a strong anecdotal case that this illusion is essential to being human. The book is curiously desultory, now citing some experiment on the brain in deadly earnest academic language, and then tossing off a flip remark about a popular stage magician or an apparently very clever horse. We find it both entertaining and elucidating, although it may not always rise to the most demanding standards of philosophical evidence and argument.	2005-03-10

Only a Nobel Prize-winning economist could disguise a political broadside against conservatives and the George W. Bush administration inside a Trojan horse mea culpa of the Bill Clinton White House. No one could argue with Joseph Stiglitz's assertion that an effective modern economy must strike a reasonable balance between free markets and government oversight - but what is reasonable? Stiglitz regrets what is arguably the shining achievement of the Clinton Administration, namely, its success in balancing the U.S. budget. Credit him for consistency: he opposed Clinton's tax cut, just as he opposed George W. Bush's. Stiglitz's academic and professional chops are beyond question, and his insights into corporate welfare and inefficient markets are quite valuable if somewhat short of profound. We find that this volume provides strong insights into the inner workings of the American economic juggernaut. Your reaction will depend whether you agree or disagree with the author's contentions that the Clinton Administration was not liberal enough and that the present Bush Administration believes in small government.	2005-03-02

Author, coach and psychotherapist Lois P. Frankel explains how traditionally feminine behavior undermines women's career growth. She makes you feel as comfortable as possible while teaching you about \\"girlish\\" behavior that holds you back at work. As soon as she describes a problem, she jumps in with doable solutions, some easy, some quite challenging or time-consuming. Frankel shares case histories and offers many applicable techniques. She uses humor deftly and warns the gung-ho not to change everything at once. Now the caveats: Frankel does not grapple with the insoluble problem that women who behave in more forceful, unfeminine ways are often disliked and rejected, a maddening 'Catch 22' if you want to advance. She should warn that even smart tactics rarely help in a truly sexist workplace. She also needs to say that the wish to be liked isn't girlish, feminine or womanly; it is human. Contrary to platitude, other people can hurt and stigmatize you with their verbal abuse or harassment, no matter how strong you are. Still, although she hasn't unraveled every knot, Frankel comes a long way toward helping women diagnose - with a self-assessment checklist - and correct inadvertent mistakes that could be holding them back. We recommend her valuable counsel to women who want to become respected leaders.	2005-03-01

This is an authoritative, well-researched textbook on global branding. Surprisingly, it reads lighter than its considerable bulk because author Jean-Noel Kapferer uses vivid examples of real companies and products to make his points. His branding war stories make the material easier to digest, but only to a point. This remains a textbook, with more than 50 tables in 497 pages, so don't expect to zip through it. However, it is an extremely useful single source about modern brand theory. If you are a casual marketer, as opposed to a serious student of branding, reap this book's rewards by referring to specific chapters to solve problems. You will find thorough answers and illuminating examples from companies worldwide. Kapferer keeps branding in perspective and recognizes that brands are built on successful businesses. We find this book genuinely valuable and strongly recommend it to anyone in marketing and corporate strategy development.	2005-03-01

Authors Esther Cameron and Mike Green provide a short, reasonably accessible introduction to the nature of change and the methods and techniques for managing it. The introductory chapters summarize the most important points from the literature on change and change management, with a brief detour to discuss the development of psychology during the latter half of the twentieth century. Then, the authors dig right into the details of team building, team management and other nuts-and-bolts issues in organizational adaptation, giving readers enough information to hold their own in a discussion of the subject. We recommend this to anyone charged with managing organizational change, or even surviving it. The implicit promise of the title is that the authors will help readers make sense of change management. They keep that promise.	2005-03-01

This short summary extracts some of the most interesting incidents from the life of Alexander the Great and makes them accessible. It offers some great anecdotes - though the narratives about captives being raped or killed, and archers shooting out the eyes of elephants may put off some readers. Author Lance B. Kurke does a great service to anyone who likes a good yarn, but who doesn't like wading through dense books. By casting the career of the mighty Macedonian as a compendium of management lessons, Kurke even makes it possible for people to justify reading sagas about a classical hero at the office. At times, the author must reach in order to draw an appropriate management lesson out of Alexander crossing a river or killing his best friend. In fact, a few of the management lessons are rather obvious, while others seem shallow or downright puzzling. But that is a minor protest. On the whole, the author succeeds in his purpose. While this book won't displace Peter Drucker on the manager's bookshelf, we recommend it for reading on the treadmill or exercise bike, or as a pleasant diversion during a short plane ride or a solitary lunch.	2005-02-25

Some years ago, during the height of the technology stock bubble, a book entitled \\"Free Agent Nation\\" made quite a splash by glorifying the phenomenon of independent contracting. Less famously and far less optimistically, a number of economists and anthropologists pointed to this trend as a grave sign of the decay of workers' position in American society. Stephen R. Barley and Gideon Kunda, the authors of this study, steer a careful, meticulously documented middle course. They examined the observable fact of independent contracting in the high technology industry from three viewpoints: the contractors, the headhunters and the client firms. They say that the contractor is a new, different kind of knowledge worker with a unique set of opportunities and constraints. The book is clearly written, based on apparently sound evidence and illustrated with carefully chosen anecdotes. We  suggest that its primary appeal will be to academics and other students of labor market trends, but also recommend it to firms that hire contractors and to contractors themselves - both will benefit from the authors' analysis of their market.	2005-02-23

This dry-as-bones handbook gives essential overview information about the numerous, varied requirements of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOA). Reading it is much easier than reading the Act itself, mainly because the book is much shorter. Author Guy P. Lander probably comes as close as possible for a practicing securities law attorney to writing in plain English. That does not mean that this book will appeal to the general reader. We believe it will see its best service as a handy reference on the bookshelves of executives responsible for discussing their firms' SOA compliance efforts with their attorneys, auditors and peers.	2005-02-23

This book is great reading for anyone who wants to get more done through team or group efforts, from peer or cross-functional work teams to groups of volunteers. If you initiate or lead a project, this thorough guide takes you all the way through, beginning with your first decision: determining whether you should do your project alone or involve additional people. It helps you consider the trade-offs involved and the advantages and disadvantages. Then the four authors - Richard H. Axelrod, Emily M. Axelrod, Julie Beedon and Robert W. Jacobs, all organizational development consultants - lead you step by step through the process of finding the right people, inviting them to participate, getting them excited, keeping them involved and celebrating successes both along the way and when the project is done. We recommend this book to anyone who has to coordinate a group effort, from managers to corporate presidents. Almost anyone who does not work alone could benefit from applying the concepts in this book.	2005-02-23

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is one of the most complex, costly pieces of legislation to emerge from Congress in the past two decades. Author Scott Green considers the legislation itself to be a risk - not merely to managers who might find themselves disgraced or imprisoned for mere mistakes and oversights, but also to the productive forces of American capitalism. His book outlines a process for identifying and managing the kind of risk that might result in violations of Sarbanes-Oxley. His approach is blessedly free from jargon and almost intuitively obvious. Other things about this book make it appealing to a reader who has waded through other analyses of Sarbanes-Oxley and who is concerned about full compliance. First, without oversimplifying, Green presents his prescription in simple, straightforward terms. Second, he does not make an overt sales pitch for his firm's consulting services. Third, he has apparently not service-marked his favorite terminology, such as \\"Smart Links.\\" This restraint confirms that he actually has something to say to you, and is not merely trying to drum up business. What he has to say is not stunning or new, nor is it presented in sparkling prose, but we find it reasonably useful and well worth a manager's time to read.	2005-02-23

Constructing a cohesive, logical argument to refute the often-repeated claim that the media has a liberal bias requires careful planning and airtight evidence. Yet author Eric Alterman makes a strong case that, if anything, the media is dominated by conservatives who promote the findings of well-funded partisan think tanks, help book publishers who produce poorly researched ideological books, support incendiary TV and radio pundits, and abet editorialists who push the conservative line. Their goal, Alterman alleges, is to quash intelligent political debate and reduce complex arguments to simplistic black and white alternatives - all in support of a right-leaning political agenda. The book is thoroughly researched and documented, if sometimes so absorbed in its own point of view and so esoteric that only the most dedicated reader will follow it. We recommend this book to everyone interested in fostering more balanced political discussion.	2005-02-23

Author Mark Kobayashi-Hillary, an outsourcing consultant, combines detailed information about India with in-depth knowledge of outsourcing markets, processes and methods. He provides an overview of India and a profile of India's outsourcing industry, including the major players in a rapidly changing marketplace, important aspects of cultural awareness and thoughts on how to organize your outsourcing endeavor, including vendor selection and contract provisions. At times, the organizational structure of the book is somewhat disorienting, shifting focus from travel guide to outsourcing primer to nuts-and-bolts analysis of India's outsourcing market and how best to capitalize on it. Occasionally the narrative flow is a bit mechanical, but who really cares? If your company is considering or already has a major investment in offshore outsourcing in India, this book is an outright must read. Despite its structural flaws, we strongly recommend its authoritative blend of practical business, legal and cultural advice.	2005-02-23

Any investor disposed to pick stocks should read this excellent short introduction to the esoteric discipline of market neutral investing. Author Eric Stokes provides a better introduction to investment risk than the usual explanations found in most popular investing books. He also discusses a variety of ways to use the underlying principles of market neutral investing without becoming a full-fledged market neutral investor. Indeed, the quantitative capabilities and research skills necessary to run a market neutral portfolio are far beyond the scope of all but the most well-staffed investment firms. But a simple strategy like purchasing shares in an index inverse fund to hedge the risk of a long index fund could make sense for many investors. To learn if this strategy is right for you, we recommend reading this book.	2005-02-23

Irene and Michael Tobis have written an essential book for managers who run numerous small projects or complex combinations of large and small projects with multiple employees who have varying skill levels. If the process you manage hasn't been automated to the point of being an assembly line, you need this book, especially if you are responsible for team production and output. We recommend it as a fundamental part of any business management curriculum and as a training tool for new managers. Others who would benefit from it include teachers, project leaders, volunteer organization presidents and committee heads who orchestrate complex tasks. The authors provide principles, definitions and techniques that you can apply to your specific situation. Anyone who feels overwhelmed or overloaded will benefit, in particular, from chapters five and six, which focus on identifying everything you have committed to and developing a plan both to get out from under the overload and to manage future commitments more gracefully. Go get your copy.	2005-02-23

Benjamin Graham and David Dodd literally wrote the book (the classic Security Analysis, 1940) on value investing. Warren Buffett followed their advice, which helped make him a household name. But Graham and Dodd devised their investing approach in the 1930s and, obviously, the markets have changed. Investors face different accounting requirements, international investments and non-equity alternatives to traditional corporate stocks. Author Thomas P. Au has undertaken to update the vintage Graham and Dodd approach and, by using numerous examples and explanations, to make it relevant to today's markets. The basic emphasis on value remains, but he has adapted it to suit a faster, more complex investment world than the old masters ever imagined. We think that they would have approved of Au's clear, lucid, well-organized book, which is highly recommended for investors.	2005-02-23

This excellent autobiography covers the emotional life of a thoughtful man. Emanuel Derman examines his conscience dispassionately and honestly, offering a sometimes poignant account of his descent from the world of pure science to the hustle of Wall Street. His memoir flows like a conversation, albeit with many tangents. You'll learn more than you want about personnel changes at his former firms, but you'll also gain rare insights into how Wall Street makes decisions, plus a few excellent points about the inadequacy of financial theory as science. Derman's descriptions of options theory and financial models sometimes approach clarity, but may be far beyond the lay reader's understanding. We recommend this book to avid students of Wall Street and to any academic contemplating a move there. General readers who would enjoy Derman's reminiscences, and who do not mind tackling some dense scientific and financial material, will find an in-depth life story with moving reflections on the disparity between youthful ideals and mature compromises.	2005-02-23

If only you could bring yourself to ditch those losers from your portfolio, and hang onto your winners. If you can, you are unusual. Unprofitable habits afflict nearly all investors, beginners and pros alike, writes Hersh Shefrin in this intriguing study of the role of emotions in investing. Shefrin balances the jargon with plenty of real-world examples and wisely cautions you not to delude yourself into thinking that his tips will make you rich. Viewing investing through the prism of behavior finance, he analyzes emotionally-laden decisions made by private investors, money managers, bankers and other professionals handling stocks and various other forms of investments including options, foreign currency and futures. Shefrin offers juicy case histories, so his tour of behavioral finance is mostly enjoyable and useful. At times, though, the book bogs down in the author's attempts to legitimize behavior finance, a relatively new school of thought. For instance, he charges failed investors with committing \\"heuristic bias\\" or falling prey to \\"representativeness.\\" That quibble aside, we recommend this intriguing tome to investment decision makers on any level. Whether you are running billions or managing a retirement account (which, as Shefrin notes, most people do badly), maybe this book will buffer you against emotional investing and pocketbook pain.	2005-02-23

Brands have a major role in determining what people buy. Consumers purchase goods based, in part, on an emotional reaction to brands. A brand can make people feel good, cater to their personalities or give them a sense of belonging to a group they would like to join. Brands can make people seem wealthier or more appealing. But branding has to be kept in perspective, and not everyone buys author Michael Solomon's viewpoint that consumers' allegiance to particular gym shoes or soft drinks helps define their roles in society. His book places branding in the middle of the commercial universe and spins off some interesting, but highly specialized, conversations about \\"aspirational\\" marketing, \\"retailtainment\\" and other developments. Citing his research and sources in sociology, advertising and media studies, Solomon offers solid material that we recommend as necessary background reading for branding professionals. However, readers from other fields need to be really intrigued by branding and marketing to work with the book's tossed salad of unrelated marketing factoids, its generalizations and its focus on branding as a consumer driver, to the near exclusion of other factors. If the melee of brand competition intrigues you, read on.	2005-02-23

Authors Stephen and Donna Leeb present a compelling futuristic investment scenario that leaves you thinking, \\"You know, they just may be right.\\" Their approach avoids the sky-is-falling, bus-rushing-toward-the-precipice breathlessness that is common to many books that predict impending doom and gloom. The authors escape slipping on that particular patch of oil by basing their conclusions on established facts and keen analysis. For example, they rely on the widely accepted principle of Hubbert's Law when they assert that worldwide oil production will soon begin to decline. That's hardly news, but they take it a step further. They predict rising oil prices will spur inflation and the Fed will be unable to jack up interest rates to dampen it. High consumer indebtedness and the profound need to keep home values high (which props up consumer spending - the real engine that fuels American prosperity) will render the vaunted Fed feckless. Is it true? Well, about once a decade an Armageddon-is-coming book emerges that ought to be read by every investor, if only so that you know enough about what might happen to dodge it. We say this may be the one. One thing is clear regarding the global economic engine: it's time to check the oil.	2005-02-23

Women in leadership positions will thank authors Deborah M. Kolb, Judith Williams and Carol Frohlinger for their strategic advice. Their book, solidly based on the experiences of 100 women in leadership jobs, clearly identifies obstacles women face in gaining legitimacy as leaders. The authors explain how women executives' incorrect - and possibly unconscious - assumptions increase their troubles. The book teaches readers to make their assumptions explicit and to overcome obstacles with step-by-step deliberate solutions. For instance, the book counsels you to get as much information as you can before taking a new position, and then to really think about what you have learned. The main chapters enumerate five major ways to gain respect and credibility as a leader, but the authors also provide advice on negotiation and some relevant questions for job hunters to ask. Although it gets repetitive, the authors accompany the final outline of major points with specific recommendations you can implement. We recommend this book to women in business who want to move up, or who already have.	2005-02-23

A cynic toward sequels would note that Steven Covey took only a little more than 300 pages to explain his first seven habits, but 409 pages and an accompanying CD to expound on the eighth. Cynicism aside, however, this book - this 8th Habit - is worth every page. Give Covey credit. He could rest on his laurels and just write bland, non-threatening \\"how to lead\\" books and they would all be bestsellers. Covey eschews mediocrity, however, and tells it straight. Most employees experience considerable emotional pain working in their organizations, he says, because they are treated as objects, not full human beings. Covey adds his prestige to the notion that the knowledge worker is a new model for change in the unspoken, unwritten contract between employer and worker. He bases this fresh paradigm on respect for the complete person - mind, body, heart and soul - not just the part that works from nine to five. Covey's voice is powerful and unique. He is committed to helping others find their unique voices as well. We recommend this highly for anyone in the workplace.	2005-02-23

This is a very unusual business strategy book on an esoteric topic: solving complex problems with scenario planning and analysis. Author Adam Kahane also discusses how change occurs in complicated social systems. Kahane, a conflict resolution consultant, shares a pivotal skill he learned at his former jobs with Royal Dutch/Shell and Pacific Gas & Electric. He learned how to address tangled problems with scenario analysis. He tried and, as his case histories testify, did not often succeed - to solve daunting problems in intractably troubled places, such as Paraguay, Colombia, South Africa and the Middle East. He admits his approach does not always work, though he has rare successes and frequent insights. Some of his strategy's separate steps, such as scenario planning and story telling, seem to function well on their own, but he has a tendency to de-link theory and practice. We recommend this unusual, instructive book to conflict managers, strategic planning executives and citizens who want to learn why profound national change must start at the individual level.	2005-02-23

This book stems from a three-year-long collaboration between the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Reves Center for International Studies at the College of William and Mary. Scholars studied eight countries currently committed to nonproliferation - Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan - to determine what scenarios might make them change their minds. The objective was to study how the nuclear genie might get out of the bottle - but it also indicates ways to keep it contained. The book intentionally does not focus on proliferator states, such as North Korea or Iran. Even with that omission, we recommend it for the stark realities its research uncovers. One is that non-proliferating nations all look to the U.S. for reassurance that the world will stay safe for those without nuclear weapons. Another is that the world must stop Iran and North Korea's atomic ambitions, lest a tipping point occurs that would provoke other nations to conclude that their security requires swinging the biggest stick.	2005-02-23

This is not just another book about the secrets of famous companies. It is, instead, a book about the secrets of somewhat obscure but great companies. The principles that author Jason Jennings propounds are familiar enough, but most of his examples will not be familiar to the general reader. That is no drawback. Although some of these companies are less well known, they have all achieved great business success (if not fame) by applying some of the most tried, true and proven axioms of management. Treat people with respect, pay them for performance, focus on one clear and understandable mission - there is nothing new about these principles, except that they keep proving their efficacy even in the unlikeliest places. Do not look for a deep examination of management here. The book provides frustratingly scant background information about the companies themselves. But we assure those seeking a handbook of solid if venerable management advice that you will not go wrong with this interesting little book.	2005-02-23

If \\"stripping bare\\" means taking off the old coating or varnish, Jo Owen has succeeded in baring management to a delightfully ruthless degree. Owen isn't satisfied merely to proclaim that the boardroom emperor has no clothes. No, he catalogs, in encyclopedic A to Z style, every managerial fad, self-aggrandizing procedure and hypocritical impulse. Lest you mistakenly think he's from the \\"Saturday Night Live\\" school of irreverence, Owen also offers insightful options for managing the daggers and dangers of corporate life. He doesn't just tear down, he builds up. If painful truth is indeed the heart of all humor, this unbitter, honest book will leave you snickering in your cubicle or corner suite. Owen also offers real-world solutions (while admitting they may be no better than anyone else's). Stripping bare is fine, as long as you go back and apply a new-and-improved coat of varnish. Owen does. We highly recommend taking a break and learning the lessons business school skipped.	2005-02-23

Nearly every CEO of a large corporation believes that words directly from his or her mouth will inspire front-line employees. Five decades of research show just the opposite, explain consultants and authors T.J. and Sandar Larkin. Their investigations emphasize the importance of communicating change through low-level supervisors, a group that has more credibility with front-line workers. They maintain that CEOs must go beyond simply telling supervisors what to do; they must also listen to these key employees and empower them by taking their suggestions seriously. The authors provide plenty of real-world examples to bolster their case. We recommend this clearly constructed argument to CEOs and to anyone charged with communicating with large numbers of employees. This engaging treatise, a classic, is ready to persuade its next crop of managers.	2005-02-23

Can ordinary people really make money in the stock market? The five famous traders author John Boik profiles here would probably answer \\"yes,\\" but it would be a qualified yes. Beating the market requires more than just following a trading formula, as the stories of these traders' lives make abundantly clear. To win at the great game of Wall Street, a trader must learn from experience, and that means spending long hours studying. The trading rules and strategies in this book are enlightening, but most of them involve judgment calls that could only have been made by someone familiar with the daily rhythms of the market. Though the careers of the subtitle's \\"Greatest Stock Traders of All Time\\" span more than a century, their personalities and strategies are strikingly similar, a fact that Boik highlights well. Their similarities suggest that successful traders may be born with the necessary high risk tolerance, but that to become sustained victors, they need to develop strong work ethics, cultivate independent minds and never give up. We suggest this book to active traders, not buy-and-hold investors - those with low risk tolerance need not apply.	2005-02-23

This is a great manufacturing love story in which Toyota, an automaker clearly in love with its product, decides to go after the U.S. luxury car buyer, a suitor who has repeatedly ignored its advances. To get America's attention, Toyota must first re-invent itself. It must make itself more handsome (through better styling), improve its physique (be faster, stronger and need less maintenance) and prove its financial management skill (by selling great cars for less). Because time is fleeting and the buyer has many other suitors (Mercedes Benz, Jaguar, Nissan, Volvo), Toyota must work fast before its intended lover makes an irrevocable decision and buys someone else's car. Like some other love stories, this is repetitive and suffers from some plain old sloppy editing. But it makes you want to test-drive a Lexus to see what causes such a sensation. We recommend this book to CEOs and sales and marketing executives who dream of producing revolutionary, successful products for the global marketplace. And who would mind getting a little consumer love?	2005-02-23

If personal finance seems like a no-brainer for every brain but yours, this book will enhance your gray matter and your bank account. The payoff begins immediately. The authors explain complex and potentially mind-numbing terms such as \\"passive income,\\" \\"stop loss\\" and \\"productive assets\\" in lively language that entertains without condescension. The text is sprinkled with helpful easy-step programs, charts and worksheets, features that integrate your financial data into the learning curve. Your participation enhances the book's real-life examples. Quick summaries and detailed postscripts make the bite-size chapters even more digestible. Most of the examples are clear, with color and commentary that brighten potentially dry data. Occasionally, the authors slide into abstract number-crunching gymnastics that may leave readers stranded on the mat. But such mishaps are rare. And don't skip the concluding chapters about human behavior. The insights about personal accountability, positive visualization and family education provide valuable dividends. We recommend this strong performer; it will yield excellent market advice.	2005-02-23

Marvin Bower may be the most influential businessman you've never heard of. The firm he shaped into an international powerhouse, McKinsey & Company, doesn't bear his name, and he never made splashy public gifts. Yet the company that spawned the management consulting industry would not exist today without this remarkable man's clear, compelling vision. Bower or his consultants transformed countless companies and executives for the better. Here, author Elizabeth Haas Edersheim assembles dozens of testimonials to Marvin Bower's integrity, honesty and drive to excel. Her book contains the story of his life, but it reads less like a biography and more like a Harvard Business School case study - a bit dry, and chock-full of interview transcripts rather than compelling narrative. However, its similarity to a case study is oddly appropriate, since Bower was one of the first graduates of the Harvard Business School and remained connected with it for many years, even defending its case study method of teaching when it came under attack in the late 1970s. We recommend this book to leaders, to those who aspire to lead and to consultants who want to study the best of their profession in action.	2005-02-23

This book by William \\"Skip\\" Miller, a sales veteran and experienced trainer of sales managers, provides a wealth of information and guidance. Experienced sales managers will find it useful and new sales managers will find it indispensable. Miller covers cultural change, goal setting, recruitment, hiring, firing and more. He pays plenty of attention to day-to-day management, albeit in the context of his \\"ProActive\\" sales management program. Use this short, expansive manual as a handbook. For example, when you need to recruit, hire or terminate someone, consult the appropriate chapter. The book is easy to read and full of common sense. We  recommend it highly to its target audience: sales managers.	2005-02-23

When a book on persuasion leaves you uncomfortable over how easy it is to manipulate people, it has probably done a good job. Author Kurt W. Mortensen, who warns that persuasion, like other tools, can be used for good or evil, will probably raise your hackles as he takes you deeper into the world of manipulation. His advice on how to become a \\"Master Persuader\\" is convincing. Reading this volume may tell you how to win the persuasion game, but, by itself, it will not equip you to do so any more than a roadmap will transport drivers to their destinations. Luckily for buyers and voters everywhere, it takes years of experience to learn how and when to apply the lessons taught in this book. That said, within these pages the craft of craftiness is laid plain for all to read. Machiavelli move over - Mortensen wants to teach you some new persuasive techniques. We recommend this book to those whose livelihoods depend on altering hearts and minds.	2005-02-22

That may explain why author Patrick Forsyth is so generous with the space he devotes to elementary marketing tactics presented in exacting detail, ranging from how the publishing process works, to how to address a letter and what the switchboard operator does as a point of initial contact. This primer takes up about the first half of his book without delving into the title objective of selling professional services. Eventually there is some light. The next few chapters address professional practices in selling intangible services. Forsyth offers abundant, almost dizzying detail. The checklists and flow charts that illustrate some of his basic ideas are helpful and he reiterates key points as needed. We believe this book will find its main purpose as a basic textbook for new service-for-a-fee providers and for those who are learning how to market the services of professional firms or their own one-person consultancies.	2005-02-22

Every step is a battle because so much is at stake. Authors and veteran political consultants James Carville and Paul Begala, who were notably pivotal on the Clinton campaigns, cleverly explain what makes a winning campaign work and what gets a politician elected. They also present the flip side and honestly explain why campaigns, including some of theirs, fail. The account is made richer by their knowledge of memorable historic elections, their references to using campaign concepts in business management and a few good recipes. Conversational, loose, opinionated and frank, this book is entertaining and instructive, with clear explanations of carefully distilled ideas and plenty of insider war stories. The authors may harbor some warmth for the Democrats, but that doesn't tame them as they skewer and critique both parties. We recommend this book to executives and professionals as a fun, extended metaphor on winning that includes some practical rules and sharp storytelling.	2005-02-22

Marketing consultants Don and Heidi Schultz present a plain-language deconstruction of branding jargon in this guide for executives who want to understand branding and build brands. The book's strength is its simplicity and clarity. At times, however, it reads like a series of articles that once were published separately, so that certain essential information is restated - often in virtually identical language. However, we find that the information in the book is valuable, as is the authors' thoughtful approach to branding. Their book merits a read by marketers and corporate decision makers.	2004-12-22

Much of what author Barbara J. Streibel says is common sense, but any manager charged with running meetings knows how quickly common sense goes out the window in that setting. The author covers all of the bases and provides a series of useful checklists to help harried managers meet more effectively and efficiently. Streibel also provides many helpful references to other books that discuss specific techniques and practices. While little here is wildly original, we find that the author gives fresh, lucid and practical treatment to tried-and-true guidance.	2004-12-22

The Vanguard Group is the world's second-biggest mutual fund company, and author Jack Brennan is its chairman and CEO. When this book was published, Vanguard had 15 million shareholders and approximately $600 billion under management. Vanguard pioneered index funds, a type of investment that aims to reflect, not beat, the returns of the market. Because Vanguard does not pay fund managers to outguess the market, it can keep fund fees and expenses low. This economy is one of its primary assets. Brennan's book, written with Marta McCave, recapitulates sound principles of long-term investing in a straightforward, user-friendly way and details numerous kinds of investments. He does not tell you how to strike it rich in the markets or discover the next Microsoft or recognize unusual patterns in price charts. Better yet, he tells you how to build wealth the unexciting but generally reliable way: slowly, carefully and dispassionately. We recommend this excellent book to those who don't want to get rich quick, but who would be very content to get rich eventually. Warning: this book is not for the greedy.	2004-12-22

This is an accessible introduction to bonds by a financial professional whose first book - as unlikely as it may seem - was a study of Max Jacob, the French poet. The literary background of the author, Annette Thau, may account for her book's clear, easy-to-read style. Most authors who write about bonds tend to get lost in the complex mathematics and specialized jargon of the bond markets. Not Annette Thau. Whether you are an individual investor trying to balance your portfolio with bonds, or a student of finance looking for a more lucid explanation of the subject than you can find in your textbooks, we highly recommend this book to you.	2004-12-22

This very short book demonstrates the truth of the proverb, \\"Money does not buy happiness.\\" Author Tim Kasser cites numerous studies as he makes a compelling case that materialists are lonely, narcissistic, hampered in relationships, compulsive, insecure and disconsolate. This excellent, necessary work should be required reading for every graduating student and mid-career executive or professional. It is not quite a self-help book, although the author does offer a chapter of advice on how people can attempt to change their ways and even to form a less materialistic society. This is not merely a psychological study, although it recapitulates numerous experiments. It is only in part a polemic against materialism. On the whole, it is a curious work, one that may be a bit too facile and popular in tone to satisfy the most rigorous academic reader, yet far too packed with source citations to appeal immediately to many casual readers. We appreciate this thorough presentation of evidence for a truth to which even the most ardent materialists (such as the Material Girl herself) pay reflexive lip service. No individual or society can legitimately ignore the fact that material success does not correlate with satisfaction or well-being but has a high correlation with low self-esteem, depression, divorce and various forms of abuse.	2004-12-22

Almost every financial advisor will find this useful. Authors Scott West and Mitch Anthony summarize many important facts of life in sales, and they do so in a concise, highly readable style that is free of jargon. They counsel financial advisors to communicate with clients in easily understandable language, using self-deprecating wit, stories and vivid metaphors. They rightly remind readers that people make decisions about advisors based on what they feel more than on the quality of the advisors' charts and graphs. Then, they discuss different potential clients and show advisors how to appeal to the most critical, most rapidly expanding target markets. We highly recommend this specific, focused sales guide to financial advisors.	2004-12-22

This is an excellent book, thought provoking, lucidly written and full of ideas that seem fresh and new even three decades after first publication. Richard Dawkins is a preeminent writer on science and this was the first of his impressive, award-winning books on various scientific and philosophical subjects. Here and there, the book, which covers evolution, heredity, man's place among living creatures and many other subjects as well, shows its age. For example, Dawkins refers to transistors in his discussion of computers, wonders whether a computer will ever be able to win a chess match against a grand master and seems to think that understanding the gene sequence is an almost impossibly distant dream. But the book's underlying logic and its big ideas have nothing antiquated or obsolete about them. We highly recommend it to the intellectually curious.	2004-12-22

This book presumes that you have a deep, broad acquaintance with philosophy, literature, music and psychology, setting the bar high enough to deter all but committed and highly educated readers. Those undaunted by this barrier will find themselves amid an awesome tour de force of philosophical inquiry. Author Martha Nussbaum uses the ancient foundations of stoicism as a platform for a theory about emotions that, curiously enough, elevates and honors emotions - the same unruly forces that the Stoics eradicated. Yet, unfortunately, Nussbaum wrote her 700-plus pages so dryly that she makes even the story of a lonely man rescuing a little stray dog as bloodless and dusty as a mummy. Recounting her mother's death, she betrays the flicker of a tear, but quickly dries it with the towel of analysis. It seems strange that a study of the emotions should be so barren of emotional content. However, we assure persevering readers who keep digging through the dry sands of this book that they will discover some marvelous intellectual architecture buried deep beneath.	2004-12-22

America's fascination with the auto helped build and change the entire country. But as author Micheline Maynard writes, Detroit has lost its grip on American drivers by relying on overgrown distribution systems, styling myopia, reduced quality, brand mismanagement and family ownership. These factors, to varying degrees, combined to weaken the Big Three (Ford, General Motors and Chrysler). As an automotive journalist, Maynard apparently has all the facts, interviews and trade show vignettes to tell the story of the Big Three being replaced by non-U.S. manufacturers who simply do the job better. She also includes interviews with car shoppers and others who are not germane to her tale. Still, this is a powerful chronicle on the threatened, imminent demise of more American icons. We find this very valuable reading for marketing and human resource professionals, corporate change management executives and anyone interested in buying a car.	2004-12-22

If you get nervous before speaking in public, if you hear snores coming from the audience, if people keep leaving the room to \\"take a call\\" and don't come back, if your few remaining listeners are focused on their Blackberries, you definitely need this book. Authors Brad McRae and David Brooks have long, varied experience in public speaking and offer a concise, well-organized, straightforward guide for the perplexed. The book covers everything you need to know about making an excellent public presentation: how to meet deadlines, how to organize your slides, what to do when construction workers start hammering in the next room, even how to handle hecklers and pests. The authors provide a wealth of anecdotes and illustrations. As a bonus, much of their counsel about public speaking equally applies to other kinds of communication, so the principles in this book can help you improve not only your speaking but your writing, website design and more. We recommend it highly.	2004-12-22

Corbett boldly stakes out the territory for his book on outsourcing. As a consultant and as an advocate of the offshore outsourcing movement, he states plainly that he wants this to become the essential guidebook for anyone considering outsourcing. Impressively, he takes great strides toward achieving just that. Clearly written and easily readable, his book refutes exaggerated concerns about job loss while providing nuts and bolts advice on getting started, picking a leader for your outsource project design team, negotiating contracts and maintaining your relationship with your outsourcing vendor. He makes a sound case for a strategic approach to outsourcing as a potential primary driver of the global economy. We find that his comprehensive treatment of outsourcing issues makes this a must-read for anyone who seeks a better understanding of the outsourcing phenomenon, particularly executives thinking about dipping their toes into offshore waters.	2004-12-22

You would hardly expect economist Alfred E. Kahn, the grandfather of deregulation, to back down on the concept now - and he doesn't. This helpful, up-to-date guide gives a snapshot of Kahn's take on the state of aviation and telecommunications deregulation amid the economic struggles of the post-bubble, post-Sept. 11 era. Does deregulation still serve the public's interest? Kahn, whom you can thank or curse the next time you board a cheap, overcrowded flight, argues staunchly that deregulation's biggest problems come from regulatory authorities who succumb to the temptation to, well, regulate. This is particularly true in the arcane field of telecommunications policy, where some governmental bodies have passed regulations designed to stimulate artificial, rather than market-driven, competition. Overall, the book is stronger when Kahn analyzes the complexities of aviation deregulation than it is when he unravels telecommunications policy. We highly recommend it to policy wonks who love what Kahn hath wrought and to those who wish they could hang up on it.	2004-12-22

No one claims that marketing any service is easy, but marketing financial services is especially difficult. Today, you can buy financial products - mutual funds, insurance, banking services, mortgages, credit cards - through a variety of channels and providers, often at a discount. This creates a challenge for financial marketers, who tend to rely on proven time-tested marketing techniques from other industries that are not always effective for financial products. Here, consultants Evelyn Ehrlich and Duke Fanelli present marketing basics in a financial services context. Their best material comes from short case studies or vignettes from real financial services companies. Readers may wish there were more of these since much of the marketing content is not new. This is a good basic book for newcomers to marketing in the financial services industry, but veterans will find it less valuable. We recommend it to novice marketers or to those working in financial service firms' non-marketing areas (such as operations, shareholder services or sales) who want a marketing briefing.	2004-12-22

It's good to hear that employing a clear, open business policy can boost the bottom line and upgrade management. With all the recent corporate scandals, a management approach based on \\"what you see is what you get\\" is refreshing - and it works. Transparent management can increase employee morale, retention and productivity. Transparent leaders are better at their jobs and make a difference in people's lives. Using case studies and self-assessment surveys, authors Barbara and Elizabeth Pagano help potential leaders evaluate and hone their honesty and their leadership styles. The case studies in this easy to read, if slightly repetitive, volume help convey the authors' key points, which center on honesty, awareness and open communications. We recommend this value-enriched book to aspiring leaders, managers and executives who may be surprised to learn that transparent leadership is one of those intangibles that can produce concrete results.	2004-12-22

Consultants Fons Trompenaars and Peter Prud'homme thoroughly explore issues in corporate culture, and focus on managing change across disparate cultures. They first review milestones in business publishing, tracing the ebb and flow of corporate culture as a fashionable management subject. They offer a unique model for analyzing and assessing corporate culture, though that will primarily interest academics. General business readers will find more utility in the very brief but interesting profiles of companies that successfully managed cultural conflict while becoming global leaders: Nokia, Ikea, Applied Materials, Acer and Suez. The book's style sometimes veers into the numbingly academic but, for the most part, it speaks comfortably to the general reader, despite grammatical errors. We recommend this to anyone who must resolve cultural issues in the wake of a merger or acquisition.	2004-12-22

Hedge funds are complex, risky investment vehicles. Other funds, such as most equity mutual funds, have straightforward investment strategies. By contrast, equity-oriented hedge funds may engage in various trading practices and investment strategies. They may be short funds, long-short funds or market neutral funds. And equity-oriented hedge funds are only a small sliver of the hedge fund universe. Thus, assessing the risk of hedge funds is a challenge. In language intelligible to most lay readers, author Richard Horwitz lays out the issues to consider when evaluating hedge fund risks. He has accomplished a great deal merely by writing this in readable prose, instead of in equations. He also explains his company's hedge fund risk measurement system. We believe every hedge fund manager and anyone who even thinks of investing in a hedge fund should read this book.	2004-12-22

This book offers a somewhat rambling compendium of solid (if unoriginal) investment advice. Author Howard Ruff's strength is his blunt, straightforward, unpretentious style. He covers a great deal of ground, discussing everything from the advisability of investing in gold to the principles of life and time management. Many readers will no doubt find this both useful and refreshing. Others will look for more depth - and the author obliges by including appendices with sources of additional information on various topics. We suggest this book to those who are new at financial planning and who lust for wealth, but are willing to settle for prosperity. And safety. And sound investing.	2004-12-22

Has your corporation or department misplaced its vision, purpose or spirit? Relax. Author Robert A. Neiman provides an effective path out of the lost-and-found department. Neiman's 12-step program offers practical solutions and political advice for even hardcore bureaucracy addicts. The text features true-to-life scenarios, worksheets and instructions for a full menu of corporate activities, ranging from dreaded employee reviews to awards ceremonies. The author's portrait of corporate life is like an excellent still-life painting, with realistic details, highlights and shadows. The text is enhanced with actual snapshots from testy workplace situations. These insertions, however, would work better with a bit of pruning and, although the vignettes are helpful, it is tempting to skim these little corporate dramas. But don't skip the charts and worksheets. These features are excellent tools. What's more, the author's insistence on honesty, integrity and personal responsibility is a business wakeup call. We recommend this book to every ambitious worker, manager or executive on the corporate ladder.	2004-12-22

The three authors - consultant Hank Karp, organizational development executive Connie Fuller and academic Danilo Sirias - admit they began their project with some hypotheses about the differences between Boomers and Xers. One of the most powerfully suggestive was the theory that Xers are much more individualistic than Boomers, which has the potential to create some worrisome issues for managers. Although their statistical analysis found some support for this notion, it also revealed, paradoxically, that Xers are real team players, perhaps even more so than Boomers. The authors do their best to write around that awkward fact, but the fact stubbornly remains: when it comes to working on teams, only seemingly subtle differences separate Boomers and Xers. The book offers a lot of reliable, proven tips about team management, so it is worthwhile. However, its credibility is somewhat damaged by the authors' repeated references to differences and gaps whose existence seems pretty minimal, even in the eyes of their own research. While that may make this seem like a curious book about a solution to an elusive problem, we recommend it to those who are also pursuing solid, general team management guidance.	2004-12-22

It should be on the bookshelf of anyone who aspires to any level of success in any organization or profession. It should not gather dust but should be read regularly, according to a plan - one law a day, for example, absorbed slowly and contemplated deeply. Author Robert Greene draws on a rich variety of sources including books so threatening that they were banned by the ancient Chinese. He cites the memoirs of Machiavelli, various con men and many others who swept aside what ought to be in order to focus on what is. It might seem that anyone who follows all of these laws in their rich, narrative detail will turn out to be a very unpleasant person. That's probably not true. We suspect, in contrast, that the person who masters the laws of power will be extremely pleasant, with winning ways and a knack for likeability, yet awe-inspiring and in control - though not always obviously so. Doesn't that sound tempting?	2004-12-01

Leadership often is assigned a mystical quality, as if people either possess the spark that makes others follow them, or they don't. Well, now you can lead without the innate spark. In fact, the U.S. Army sets out to prove that anyone can become a leader, as this engaging book from the Leader to Leader Institute explains. Using The Army Leadership Manual (abstract available from getAbstract) as its foundation, this volume demystifies leadership. Promisingly enough, this speedy read persuasively argues that being a leader requires little more than honesty and competence. Throw in an ability to communicate and a willingness to listen to your people, and you could become the next Patton, or at least a respected officer. This enlightening tome is a little thin on ways to turn its leadership development philosophy into action. Still, we recommend it to managers and to those who strive to become leaders.	2004-12-01

If you are a new manager, aspire to a managerial position or recently promoted an employee to a managerial or supervisory position, we suggest this manual as required reading. In fact, every new manager should be given a copy of the book along with the promotion. Too often great employees are promoted without any concept of the new skill set required to succeed as a manager or supervisor. This handbook clearly identifies the new competencies needed and explains how to develop or acquire them. Author Morey Stettner also pinpoints many of the common mistakes new managers make - and tells you how to avoid them. Anyone studying business management in college also should read this book, since it provides good, practical \\"in the trenches\\" advice that's hard to find in textbooks.	2004-12-01

This is a useful guide to one of the hottest subjects in sales: selling solutions, not products. Author Keith M. Eades offers a methodical, step-by-step approach to implementing a conversational approach to selling. The principles underlying \\"solution selling\\" are simple and straightforward, and the process is hard to fault, although it demands a great deal of record keeping and charting. The author's explanation of the procedures gets a bit mechanical and jargon-riddled at times. But on the whole, we believe every salesperson is apt to find something of value in this book, even if it's a reminder of what once was known but has been forgotten.	2004-12-01

This book by former Philadelphia 76ers president Pat Croce doesn't break any new theoretical ground about leadership, but Croce makes the heavy lifting required of exceptional leaders look and sound attainable. Good leaders, Croce says, should be servants, not dictators. His fast-paced, motivational primer is an entertaining, anecdote-filled, step-by-step guide for starting and leading change, complete with no-nonsense tips and salty, locker-room exhortations (\\"If you rest, you rust,\\" \\"Don't let your thinkin' become stinkin'\\" and several that are less printable). Particularly compelling are Croce's homespun tales about the boyhood lessons he picked up on the mean streets of north Philadelphia. His local heroes include a Catholic nun who turned a dream into a homeless shelter and his father, \\"the original Pat Croce,\\" who taught his son how to out-negotiate a hustler for a great deal on a leather coat - but to do it with integrity. Croce dispenses advice in a series of to-do lists peppered throughout the book, including \\"Twelve Ways to Build a Passionate Team,\\" \\"Croce's Three Rules for Praise;\\" the \\"Six C's of Communication;\\" the \\"Ten Commandments of Service\\" and more. We recommend this book as a lively and colorful read, and a worthwhile reminder that good leaders are made - not born. They are reflected by the teams they create and the values they live by day to day.	2004-12-01

Obviously, innovation, creativity and new ideas are important in business. Author Paul Sloane offers a number of techniques and practices to encourage the generation and development of new ideas. He says little startlingly new, but he offers leaders a handy, practical guide to the well-trodden paths of brainstorming, tolerance of failure and leadership by example. The most enjoyable part of the book is the long list of utterly dunderheaded quotations from experts in various fields declaring that such innovations as submarines, nuclear power, railroads and steamships are impossible. We recommend this book because it will encourage you to question your assumptions and to look for places where conventional wisdom is probably wrong - there's certainly no harm, and a great deal of good, in that.	2004-12-01

Novice and experienced managers, coaches and teachers, and anyone else who wants to influence other peoples' behavior or performance will benefit from Ferdinand F. Fournies' book on coaching. He describes specific intervention tactics and shows how to apply them. Use this manual to eliminate managerial frustration. It can be your stepping stone to creating a successful, high-performing department. Fournies' concepts can help even seasoned managers deal with difficult staff, solve problems in their departments and achieve greater results through their employees. If you are a new manager or wish to be one, this essential resource and training tool is required reading. We also recommend it as a strong addition to any management curriculum.	2004-12-01

Many companies, especially in high-technology industries, build their sales effort around early adopters. But early adopters are a minority of the market and their needs and preferences are distinct from those of the mainstream. To adjust their sales effort to the mainstream majority of the market, companies must listen to their audience. Instead of building sales messages around products, they need to build their sales communications and their sales process around customer needs and preferences. Customer-centric selling begins in the earliest stages of marketing and proceeds through the final sale. Authors Michael T. Bosworth and John R. Holland clearly set forth the nature of customer-centric selling and provide a comprehensive guide. We recommend this worthwhile addition to any salesperson's bookshelf.	2004-12-01

John Adair offers a very good little handbook of leadership and management counsel, with some additional advice on setting personal and life goals. He provides little original material and freely gives credit to others for the ideas he borrows. He is clear and straightforward in his presentation, wasting no words. It would be beneficial to keep this book in a desk drawer or on a convenient bookshelf and look into it every day or two, reading a single page or even a single paragraph. We recommend thinking of it as a useful reminder of things you probably already know, but may forget to practice. As Adair advises, one way to manage your time is to use book abstracts whenever possible. We could hardly argue with that.	2004-12-01

O'Hara profiles 20 of the world's oldest - at least two centuries - family-held businesses, representing a combined 8,911 years of experience. O'Hara uses profiles of these companies and their leaders to explain how these family businesses survived when so many others failed. Generally, only about a third of family firms survive the transition from the founding generation to the second wave, and the mortality rate worsens over time. Given the global reach of these businesses and their extraordinary longevity, O'Hara offers unique information. The drawbacks are slight: sometimes the book reads too much like an anecdotal travelogue and occasionally it surrenders to generalities about family businesses, though that may have been unavoidable. These quibbles aside, we strongly recommend this book for anyone seeking insights into how families work together, stay together and profit together, generation after generation.	2004-11-22

If this provocative book does not generate controversy, it will mean something truly dreadful is filling the headlines and news broadcasts. Author Samuel P. Huntington is willing to say flat out that the white, Anglo-Protestant culture of the United States was important and valuable, and is now endangered. Yet Huntington is not mired in some white-washed past. He's a respected political scientist with an endowed chair at Harvard. His views are not extreme. On the contrary, the vast majority of the American people probably share them, even if they cannot articulate them in Huntington's elite language. He explains the historic evolution of the American identity and the American Creed, and describes their past, present and future in value-based terms. He'll keep you intrigued whether you disagree with his treatise or embrace it as justification for your discomfort, at the least, or your anger and fear, at the most. Whatever your prejudices, dispositions or inclinations about the trends in American society and cultural values, we believe this is a book worth reading.	2004-11-22

The sophisticated permutations of marketing are useful only to those who have already mastered the basics. Start with this primer. Although author Patrick Forsyth sub-titled his manual \\"an insider's guide to the field,\\" the book seems more directed to newcomers or marketers who are still in the early stages of their careers. For insiders, marketing is a series of difficult choices made by professionals after extensive research. Here's how to begin that thought process and climb that learning curve. Forsyth offers a range of introductory material that you can easily summarize and understand. Even readers who stumble over the somewhat illogical chapter order may well enjoy the author's humor and British references. He also offers some nifty tidbits, like learning about the tachistoscope, which measures how many times shoppers blink, or about \\"invisible exports,\\" such as seminars. The reports on export selling, the Internet and the future of marketing may leave you, like Oliver Twist, wanting more. We suggest this book to entry and mid-level marketers, to teachers and to those in other fields who need an overview of marketing.	2004-11-22

In a global economy, you inevitably will work with people from other cultures. But since culture determines behavior, how can people from outside the United States best adapt to working in the American workplace? And, how do they perceive American workplace behavior? Author Craig Storti examines American culture and extracts six key themes that drive the U.S. workplace. In the process, he teaches his fellow Americans about their unexamined workplace behavior. That's refreshing. Looking at yourself from the outside helps you re-examine how you work with others. The process opens doors to a whole new evaluation process that could revitalize many businesses. Unfortunately, while Storti makes interesting cultural points, his book is repetitive and belabors obvious ideas. His practical advice on such topics as table manners, fashion, gift giving, eye contact, touching and even sending e-mail is valuable, but could have been presented better in succinct bullet point summaries. However, we appreciate his introduction to behavior, manners and mor&eacute;s in the cross-cultural workplace.	2004-11-22

Provide such outstanding service to your clients that they will want to introduce you to others. This is easier said than done, but when it is done right, it's very effective. Author Bill Cates provides a treasury of lore, some obvious but often ignored, some creative and new, all of it useful in building a referral-based business. He writes clearly, concisely and succinctly. We gladly recommend - or refers - Cates to you; his guidebook is practical for anyone in almost any business.	2004-11-22

This collection of articles and academic studies varies widely in tone and readability, but provides a much-needed critical look at the new Basel Capital Accord (Basel II). This international agreement on bank capital standards, scheduled to replace the 1988 Basel Capital Accord (Basel I) in 2006, will directly affect 10 to 20 of the biggest banks in the U.S., but may have a ripple effect on smaller institutions. The expert authors gathered here agree that Basel I, though ground-breaking and necessary, was too simplistic. However, the solutions proposed by Basel II create new problems in addition to solving old ones. Just as Basel I did not prevent the worldwide financial crises of the late 1980s and early 1990s, new problems are already arising that are not adequately addressed by Basel II. The new accord is an important step, but may best be understood as an evolving process rather than a set of ironclad rules. We recommend this book to bank regulators, managers of large banks and anyone else with a vested interest in international banking standards.	2004-11-22

International in scope, immensely detailed and authoritative, this study successfully incorporates the evolution of technology, laws, political policy and social development to put the origins of modern media into context. This historical perspective is long overdue. Since media development is actually the story of societal development, author Paul Starr does a tremendous job of detailing the roles of such diverse factors as innovation, invention, patronage, luck, law and competition, all of which shaped the media's development and helped determine its ultimate societal impact. This book is refreshingly light on political criticism, so each set of facts stands on its own. While Starr occasionally meanders from the main topic, the book's rich detail shows that he clearly enjoyed his research and writing. We consider his book essential reading for anyone interested in new and old media and how they were - and are - influenced by their societies.	2004-11-22

This is a fine, short guide to managing conflict. Author Tim Ursiny particularly addresses those of you who are \\"conflict cowards,\\" people who do not like conflict...and who does, outside of a few well-compensated litigaters? Ursiny himself is a confessed hater of conflict. He has hated it ever since he was a child and now, even though he's an executive coach and a fairly beefy guy, he still hates it. He is also a psychologist, and his style and approach have much in common with the work of other pop psychology writers, although this guide is more useful than most. Ursiny keeps the reading light by providing ample anecdotes and he invites readers to participate through several self-examination questionnaires. He provides some clearly written, easily accessible explanations of how conflicts occur and how to manage them. In fact, he defines conflict, its consequences and even its benefits so broadly that almost anyone fits the book's target audience. You got a problem with that? We doesn't and warmly recommend this entertaining, refreshing book, which - we agree - has something for almost everyone who'd rather duck than fight.	2004-11-22

Abigail Trafford's compassionate guide to the post-retirement years is a fascinating collection of personal stories, mixed with a healthy dose of sociological and scientific findings. Her research into what she calls \\"the Bonus Decades\\" began when she found new meaning in her life after age 50. As she talked with hundreds of members of her generation, or \\"My Timers,\\" Trafford uncovered a quiet revolution in the making. These adults, who are finished with child-rearing and have reached the end of successful careers, are wondering, \\"now what?\\" as they face longer, healthier lives post-retirement. It is this generation, she predicts, that will change the structure of the workplace, reaffirm the values of family and community, and leave an enduring legacy. Trafford's insightful comparison of the storms of adolescence to the emotional and spiritual crises of late adulthood will resonate with anyone facing retirement, a late-in-life career change or simply a growing feeling of anxiety and dissatisfaction with the norm. This is not a how-to book or a survival manual, but a reassuring travel guide to the uncharted territory of \\"Second Adolescence.\\" We recommend this book to everyone older than 50 or soon to arrive there - after all, it's about time.	2004-11-18

This collection of essays would make the perfect gift for that friend who loves nothing more than to curl up with a human resources manual. The fruit of a colloquium held at the University of Virginia's Darden Graduate School of Business Administration in 2002, it brings together a wide range of contributors, spanning the spectrum from A to P - from academics who write about learning to practitioners who implement learning programs in corporations. The quality of the essays is uneven. Some of them are so chock-full of jargon that they could only make sense to a knowledge management consultant. Others are clear enough to be practical, at least in the hands of an insider. While the theoretical and abstract dominate the discussion, a couple of real-life case studies by actual executives bring the book down to earth. We recommend this compendium to practitioners in its field. They will particularly love the stimulating reflections of an Australian-born CEO who unabashedly professes his admiration for the great white shark and expresses the fond wish that his employees would approach learning in the spirit of great whites in a feeding frenzy.	2004-11-04

Public relations (PR) is a critical feature of any modern institution's marketing program. However, it is often not seriously considered as a legitimate part of corporate administration because it frequently focuses primarily on tactics - what to do, when and how - and rarely rises into guiding overall company strategy. Yet, if you want a practical guide that will show you how to create a media kit or develop a crisis management plan, Joe Marconi's book is for you. It delivers solidly at this general tactical level, where it is, indeed, a working guide. However, it does not transcend into more theoretical reaches. The book skimps on some more meaty, advanced areas such as the theory of public relations and how it fits into overall corporate strategy. The chapters also do not seem to be arranged in progressive order by subject. For example, chapters on speechwriting are sandwiched between those on crisis management and ethics. However, we find this book valuable for those who want an overview of PR's work-a-day aspects, including normal business tactics if not sophisticated corporate strategy. It also will help those who are not fully familiar with what PR can deliver to a modern institution in challenging times.	2004-11-04

This book is a handy compilation of observations, hypotheses and speculations on the subject of Richard Branson. Author Des Dearlove freely and frankly admits his debt to several other writers who have probed the Branson story in depth and breadth. There is little if anything original to be found, aside perhaps from the author's style of presentation, which tries hard to be light and deft. Although the book carries you along, its biggest punch resides in the author's list of \\"10 secrets\\" of Branson's success. Readers who would like to know in the most general terms what Branson has done and how he has done it, and who are willing to swallow a few clich&eacute;s in lieu of explanations, will seize upon this book.we think you will enjoy it and, after all, enjoying your work is one of Branson's great secrets.	2004-11-04

This is a sometimes dense, often rambling and always interesting book about the history of science, the history of social philosophy and many points of congruence between the two, from how traffic jams happen to how communities self-organize. Author Philip Ball seems to include almost every notable physical scientist since Sir Isaac Newton as he traces how key scientific theories have influenced or been influenced by the speculations of economists and political scientists. Anyone whose acquaintance with science is minimal, but whose curiosity is deep, will find that reading this book is something like floating down a river that is a sometimes windy, sometimes swampy, sometimes roiling stream of discoveries, ideas, broken hypotheses and curious characters. There are two small flaws. First, the author identifies almost every scientist who ever worked on a problem remotely related to the book's subject and sometimes he does not clear the path through the thicket of names and experiments. And, second, in a social science discussion toward the end, Ball permits his political biases to color his story with occasional, apparently heartfelt, denunciations of right-leaning politicians. These quibbles aside, we say buy this book and enjoy an intriguing raft ride through interesting intellectual waters.	2004-11-04

In this purpose-driven book, author Martin Wolf stakes out his intellectual turf clearly and defends it. Wolf begins with the concept that the value of the individual and the importance of that individual's right to pursue economic advancement are the foundation of the world's great democracies. From there, he levels a devastating critique against the anti-globalists and the diverse interests that oppose the global integration of markets. He presents strong evidence that the power of international corporations has been exaggerated, and concludes that the issue isn't too much globalization, but rather too little. This clear-eyed, well-researched defense of globalization should become a mainstay in any library of economic rationalism. We recommend it most highly.	2004-11-04

It's rare for a business book to offer first-hand, practical advice from a thinker who has revolutionized academic thought in his field. Here, that thinker is co-author Peter Salovey, the pioneer who invented the concept of emotional intelligence. Salovey provides a practical, application-oriented guide. With co-author David R. Caruso, he shows you how to take the idea of emotional intelligence -- that emotional well-being and wholeness are at least as essential as intellectual capacity -- and use it to do something truly relevant: create emotionally intelligent managers. The authors thoughtfully steer away from the superficial, self-help genre pitfall that purports to offer an easy one-book panacea. Instead, they offer a series of case studies and interactive exercises that may help even the most hard-hearted executive become less emotionally challenged. We give this book its highest recommendation; it's a gift to those toiling in the emotionally barren modern workplace.	2004-11-04

While human resource management (HRM) departments are a critical part of the modern corporation, they are often considered detached from the daily workings of their own employees. In a multinational modern corporation, these problems are exacerbated when other issues distract HRM professionals. Authors Fons Trompenaars and Charles Hampden-Turner inadvertently explain why many corporate employees consider HRM departments irrelevant. Meandering and without focus, their book rarely signals just where it is going. While it is part of a cross-cultural series, this book's stated intent is to make HRM a stronger part of corporate management through the ways it recruits, trains and rewards staff members. The authors cite interesting facts and studies as they discuss various facets of human resource management, including change, motivation, recruitment, assessment tools, managing teams, organizational learning, leadership development and diversity, all with some attention to cross-cultural issues. Although this book falls short of hitting its stated goal of placing HRM at the center of the modern corporation, we appreciate its ambition and the scope of its coverage.	2004-11-04

This guide to job hunting may provide a practical boost if you're looking for a job. It recaps some of the most widely known and broadly discussed tips about job seeking, and presents them clearly and concisely. Though it has little that is brand new, it does put some things in a different, positive light. Author Todd Bermont backs up his book with a website and provides details about his 10 recommendations. While they may not really be secrets, they amount to an organized 10-step path to finding a new and better job. Bermont is chatty, and uses conversational (as opposed to textbook) grammar, as he boosts your self-confidence and assures you that the perfect job is out there, if you search for it the right way. His first three steps urge you to deal with your own assets and wishes before you begin to contact prospective employers. However, once you are ready for that step, he makes sure you know how to proceed with the right resume, contact strategy and interview technique. We recommend this book to those who are searching for entry level or mid-level jobs. It may not be quite sophisticated enough to open doors into the executive suite, but when you're out of work your job becomes finding a job - and this book will help.	2004-11-04

British journalist and historian Godfrey Hodgson dissects the rise of conservatism in the U.S. during the last quarter of the twentieth century. Hodgson is an unapologetic liberal, and though he's ultimately optimistic about America, he finds much to lament in this period. Even die-hard conservatives might be given pause by his warnings about growing social stratification and inequality. Hodgson's greatest contribution to the political discussion may be his examination of this time period from so many angles, exposing myths and misconceptions about each facet of society, especially the much-ballyhooed prosperity of the '90s. The book is plagued by inadequate fact-checking on minor issues, however, which could call his larger points into question, despite 43 pages of end notes and an extensive bibliography. Despite these flaws, we find this thoughtful study useful for anyone trying to understand American politics and future trends.	2004-10-25

Dubinsky and Steven J. Skinner have to say seems like straight, plain common sense. That is so rare in books about human resource management that this seems like a small gem. Most of its content consists of vignettes of high-performing employees who go out of their way to serve customers. But the authors have arranged their material well as they discuss boosting employees who do good work in lower-level management or staff positions. Each chapter covers a trait that motivates top performers and includes succinct tips for managers. The authors also outline, on a matrix, the relationship between performance motivation and managerial initiatives. While you can easily read this book in less than an hour, putting its recommendations into effect will be the work of an organizational lifetime. We believe it will be work well rewarded.	2004-10-25

Given that - since Steven B. Sample succeeded as president of a major university - you would expect that he acquired some expertise on leadership, if only as a matter of survival. Sample borrows from an array of classical thinkers, from Shakespeare to Machiavelli to Lincoln, to advance his proposition that the most important attribute for any leader is the ability to think independently. He says that leadership demands suspending judgment, listening passionately to those with conflicting opinions and seeing all the shades of gray that exist between black and white alternatives. If his somewhat academic perspective doesn't always apply directly to the business world, it certainly supplies this book with intelligence and insight at every turn. We strongly recommend this guidebook to those who take these rare human attributes seriously.	2004-10-25

George Soros is a major hedge fund operator and philanthropist whose foundation has supported many worthy causes, especially in emerging and formerly Communist countries. He is a major donor to the U.S. Democratic Party. But is he a major thinker? Although he calls himself a philosopher, he does not test his ideas against the strongest ideas of other philosophers or put his concepts into context. In fairness, men of his wealth are perhaps unaccustomed to having to explain or justify themselves or to offer a good reason for speaking their minds. Soros certainly has strong business credentials, given his international business experience, his other books on public issues and his vast philanthropy. His ego seems monumental here, but so are his contributions and his impact. If you are a non-governmental organization seeking a Soros grant, this book will illuminate his thinking. If you are a Democrat who appreciates his support for the party, this book will tell you why he believes as he does. If you are a Republican, this is a textbook on knowing your adversaries. And, we note, if you are a non-partisan voter who has ignored media coverage of U.S. politics, this will give you the gist of the opposition's passionate case against the Bush administration.	2004-10-25

Even in the World's Most Turbulent Industry	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Highly Recommended!	James Wynbrandt has penned a well-researched, colorful account of the life and guiding principles of commercial aviation pioneer David Neeleman. The book is written in a clear, straightforward style, and offers insights into what made discount carrier JetBlue an unlikely success. The book appears, however, to reflect Neeleman's artful capacity for generating positive publicity for himself. While this is not exactly a hagiography, once you have read it, you may well envision a halo floating above Neeleman's portrait on the book's jacket. Then again, as Muhammad Ali once said, \\"If you can do it, it ain't braggin'.\\" Certainly, Neeleman's accomplishments rocked the commercial aviation industry, encouraging the major carriers to launch value-based alternatives such as Ted and Song.  We recommend this book to professionals seeking useful ideas to help their businesses gain altitude.	2004-10-25

This excellent short handbook can benefit every salesperson. The author identifies 25 of the most pernicious sales fallacies and demolishes each one. Then, he replaces them with sound common sense advice. You could summarize the book quite handily in a few words: be honest and respect your customer, listen more than you talk, learn all you can and offer not just a standard product or service but a solution to the customer's problem. This isn't the sort of book you buy to read once. It is the kind of book you buy to keep in your desk drawer and glance at periodically. Be forewarned - the author is in the business of selling sales training, and doesn't make the mistake of giving away the secrets he sells. However, we find that these simple reminders of what mistakes to avoid may sometimes be as valuable, or more valuable, than comprehensive advice on what to do.	2004-10-25

Vogel sheds valuable light on the growing importance of fun in the American economy. His book shows surprising versatility, sometimes reading like an economics textbook, and other times providing an engaging and easily readable overview of the entertainment business. Vogel provides exhaustive sources and an authoritative perspective, linking the entertainment industry's technology-driven increase in productivity to the public's increased expenditures on music, movies, sports, games, theme parks and other forms of entertainment. The relatively modest attention he pays to the performing arts reflects their unfortunate status as a poor stepchild we find this book's breadth and depth impressive, and strongly recommends it to analysts, scholars and students who seek a clear picture of the economic role of entertainment.	2004-10-25

This basic, common sense, practical and down-to-earth guide to leadership will delight anyone who has always wondered how to become a leader but never figured out how. Steve Farber, author of this treasury of leadership lore, is the leader who can help you find the leader within you. His parable is full of the kind of characters who delight storytellers, such as the affectionately-limned 22-year-old blonde in a bikini who approaches the author on a beach to ask what he thinks leadership is, or the Zen-like old, grizzled sage of leadership. These characters are designed to inspire you to believe that you, too, can be a leader, no matter how low your self-esteem. Moreover, Farber pushes business writing to the edge (in fact, one of his main characters is named Edg). He even manages to work in quotations from decadent, drunken, insane poet Charles Bukowski, author of such classics as Notes of a Dirty Old Man. Read this book and learn to follow the leader to leadership. It turns out that leadership is surprisingly easy once you know how to do it. We believe we are not giving away too much of the ending if we tell you that the author believes \\"Love\\" is the final answer to the question, \\"What is leadership?\\"	2004-10-25

Any leader will benefit from mastering sincere storytelling that is designed to achieve specific organizational objectives. By using some storytelling techniques himself, in the form of a fable about business-owning squirrels, author Stephen Denning teaches you how to tap into your natural storytelling ability, so you can focus your listeners' goals and vision. He explains what types of stories elicit a variety of desired outcomes. He also teaches you how to tell your story and explains the reaction you can expect to generate if the story is apt. Storytelling lets leaders engage people, helps them relate to the company's goals and creates a forward-looking organization. With Denning's guidance, you can use your 'once upon a time' skills to build camaraderie, focus and happy endings. We recommend this book to all leaders, since storytelling is destined to become an unexpectedly critical skill.	2004-10-25

In this excellent introduction to risk management, author Erik Banks offers a lucid, clearly written and well-organized overview. He tells readers what risk management is, why it is necessary, how it works and how companies can carry it out most prudently and cost-effectively. He manages to convey the essential information about insurance and reinsurance, the use of capital markets and derivatives, and the application of enterprise risk management concisely. This is a remarkable achievement. Most books on insurance bog down in jargon and details, while most books on derivatives are unnecessarily complicated and dense. This one - offered by the Wiley Finance Series - is neither. Although not exactly beach reading, it's about as accessible as any book on this subject could possibly be. We recommend it highly to executives and investors.	2004-10-25

You know these people from the office: the dominating Tank, the undermining Sniper, the explosive Grenade and the smarmy Know-It-All. For your sake, here's hoping you only have one or two of them running around your cubicle farm. Unfortunately, the work world is fraught with complainers, cheats, toadies and downers. To avoid becoming a downer yourself, you need coping strategies. Authors Dr. Rick Brinkman and Dr. Rick Kirschner describe 10 difficult, if slightly contrived, personalities and provide communications techniques for dealing with them. This is not a textbook, being slim on attributions and facts. It is, rather, a feel-good handbook of simple suggestions for using tactics and popular psychology to deal with someone you'd actually rather strangle. Given that choice, conversation is a better strategy. We hope it works for you, and suggests this light but well-intentioned book to human resources professionals, managers with problem employees and you, if you're feeling particularly homicidal about that knuckle-cracking, gum-popping slacker in the next cubby.	2004-10-25

This excellent, thought-provoking analysis covers a widespread but little studied shift in the way the world works. The advance of international communications, technology, economics and finance networks has had an unmistakable effect on business and industry. The ways states function has also changed - shifting the operation of the world order. Author Anne-Marie Slaughter, dean of Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, is on expert ground. She asserts that networks of financiers, regulators, judges and even legislators can solve problems that would be intractable if left only to traditional states and familiar international organizations. She provides many examples of such networks, notes the criticism against them and suggests norms to govern their conduct. Her book is not light reading. Readers need some familiarity with international organizations and institutions (sometimes cited by unexplained acronyms), but we highly recommend this book to sophisticated observers of international policy.	2004-10-25

Arrogant, greedy, impatient, inexperienced, out of touch with the real world, overpaid, overeducated and overseeing you - does that sound like an apt description of MBAs? Author Henry Mintzberg would answer with a stentorian \\"yes!\\" He marshals a powerful array of facts to support his thesis that graduate schools of business have perpetrated one of the most successful con jobs in history. They have pretended that the bright young things they send into a hungry market as MBAs are, in fact, trained professional managers with a rare grasp of management science. Management, says Mintzberg, is not a science, nor is it a profession. It is not something someone can learn to do in a business school. It is something one only learns by doing, and no one in a business school does any doing. After delivering what ought to be a fatal blow to the pretensions of MBAs and those who educate them, the author proposes a proven alternative. He is not so naïve as to believe that the facts he provides will change the world. Powerful economic interests now have a real stake in the status quo. But he hopes for change and provides plenty of ammunition. We suggest this book to those with a passionate interest in business education, pro or con.	2004-10-13

Finance is a difficult and recondite subject, perhaps second only to mathematics in its inability to inspire excitement in most readers. Yet Benoit Mandelbrot and Richard L. Hudson, co-authors of this book, manage to turn financial math into a great yarn, full of interesting characters and dramatic events. Some of what the book actually says will be old news to market professionals, but it says it quite interestingly. Mandelbrot did some of his most important financial work in the 1960s, but his ideas about leptokurtosis (which deals with the shape of probability functions), fractals (which deal with repetitive patterns) and such have received quite a bit of subsequent attention in trading rooms and in the finance departments of major universities. So, perhaps, it is merely a dramatic device that this book presents Mandelbrot as a solitary, clear-thinking prophet struggling against a blind and hostile economic orthodoxy. That presentation certainly succeeds as drama - the story races along and the reader keeps rooting harder and harder for Mandelbrot to win. The co-authors have spun an excellent saga that says important things in a new way. We think every investor, every business journalist and every financial professional ought to read this book.	2004-10-13

If you are looking for a simple guide to a complex business and career problem, preferably a guide based on children's literature, this is for you. The consultant authors believe that a \\"victim\\" culture, consisting mainly of refusal to accept accountability, is one of the gravest problems facing businesses in general and business people in particular. The victim culture stalls organizations and individual careers. Therefore, this book offers a guide to overcoming your personal victim culture through various self-help techniques, and to overcoming organizational victim cultures by related managerial practices. We understand and advocates personal and corporate accountability, the underlying theme of the book. And if the Oz metaphor is, perhaps, a little stretched here, just go with it. The advice is sound enough. Then, like Dorothy, the tin man, the lion and the scarecrow, you, too, can journey down the Yellow Brick Road to a magic kingdom where your every wish will be granted.

The late, legendary Wall Street investor Leon Levy offers a glimpse into his financial mind in this easily digested work, which is part memoir and part study of investor psychology. Writing with journalist Eugene Linden, he persuasively argues that investors' moodiness often drives the market as much as any fundamentals. Unlike many Wall Street investment strategies, Levy's approach was long-term. And as this book shows, Levy's ego was refreshingly understated. Yet his modesty proves this memoir's biggest weakness. He declines to criticize his rivals and walks us through his triumphs in only a cursory way. At the same time that he's leaving juicy details out of his memoir, he also gives short shrift to his study of investor psychology. Still, the biggest criticism of this book is that it should have been longer. We recommend this memoir to investors interested in learning from a master.	2004-10-13

Nicholas' book is not for the faint of heart or the light of wallet. If your idea of a strong investment is a 401K plan and a few blue chip stocks handed down from your dear departed grandmother, this probably isn't the book for you. However, for those interested in how the very rich get very richer, as well as those charged with the weighty responsibility of protecting institutional and private assets, this book could be worth its weight in gold or stock certificates. Nicholas writes at a level that makes his information just comprehensible to those with minimal investment knowledge, while still very useful to insiders who know the menu of every deli within a two-mile radius of Wall Street. His in-depth historical analysis explains the current strong interest in hedge funds of funds investing, and his case studies will teach you the all-important matter of how to select the right fund of fund manager we strongly recommends this book to anyone who wants or needs to learn more about investing at the most elite levels.	2004-10-13

This book provides a concise and highly readable introduction to the development of the market economy. Beginning with ancient Rome and continuing to the first years of the twenty-first century, author B. Mark Smith traces the ups and downs of financial markets. He shows how and why trading began, explains the great bubbles and panics, and connects the course of markets to the evolution of such economic institutions as central banks. You will learn about some of the more colorful characters, the rogues and geniuses behind great frauds and great rescues. The book moves quickly and cleanly through the dense thicket of market analysis. The author identifies the great market theorists, from Joseph de la Vega through Louis Bachelier to Harry Markowitz and beyond. Moreover, he considers markets on a global scale, paying attention now to Paris, now to Japan, now to Taipei. This is a great deal of material to treat in a single book and any one of the subjects undertaken could easily justify not just one but several volumes. Thus, consider this to be something like a stroll through a market museum with a good docent as your guide. Those who have already read extensively about markets and economics will appreciate the book's light touch and amusing anecdotes. Those new to the field will appreciate its accessibility. We recommend this highly to all readers with an interest in finance.	2004-10-13

Once considered a glamorous, creative and positive influence on American popular culture, the advertising business has changed so dramatically it is almost unrecognizable today. Veteran journalist Joe Cappo uses a personal approach and an historical perspective to explain the problems advertising is facing. Two decades ago, some 20 major agencies, all independent and competing against each other, developed innovative, memorable campaigns for a variety of consumer products. But those days are over. Today, four global marketing communications holding companies control 55% of marketing expenditures. This consolidation curtailed creativity, which has resulted in agencies that produce very few memorable ads or integrated marketing efforts despite unprecedented resources. Refreshingly, Cappo does not temper his industry critique in this slightly disjointed, but well-written explanation, which is buttressed by short articles from other industry experts. Cappo sounds a wake-up call for agencies to reform themselves or lose out to more effective marketing approaches from upstart independent agencies or product manufacturers.we suggest that anyone responsible for advertising budgets or for developing marketing campaigns will benefit from Cappo's view of the past - and possible future - of advertising.	2004-10-13

If you are responsible for training or developing other people, if you are in a leadership role or if you simply want to accelerate your career development, we recommend Donna Dunning's book as your personal study guide. The author utilizes her 20 plus years of experience in employee development to identify succinctly the five basic competencies everyone needs to succeed. Going a step deeper than the usual treatment, she recognizes that individuals who want to develop a particular competency may not understand what mastering that competency looks like. For example, what does \\"mindfulness\\" look like? Can you see mindfulness? Not really. But you can see the results of mindful behavior. Dunning focuses on identifying specific behaviors that demonstrate each competency so anyone who wants to develop a skill knows exactly what to do. Then she takes the process still further, identifying how personality types and preferences have an impact on the development of each of the five basic competencies. She shows facilitators how to work most effectively with each personality type to develop individuals to their full potential in a collaborative manner with the least amount of frustration and resistance.	2004-10-13

Perhaps the highest praise for this refreshing little memoir is this: if certain other captains of industry had read Ken Iverson's book when it was published in 1998 and heeded its advice, investors would have been spared billions in losses and a slew of corporate scandals would have been averted. Iverson, head of steel maker Nucor Corporation, injects much-needed common sense into the often-bureaucratic, hierarchical world of corporate boardrooms and corner offices. This persuasive text, written in the sort of clear, muscular prose you'd expect from a steel man, will make you want to give up your executive parking space and embrace an egalitarian corporate structure. We recommend this engaging work to managers who want to look at their jobs a new way.	2004-09-16

You could fill a small library with books on what entrepreneurs do, how and why. However, until now, that library would have little to offer readers interested in non-profit entrepreneurship. The nine successful social entrepreneurs profiled here are global agents of change, risk takers and organization builders. However, they measure success not by how much money they make, but by how many lives they change. They care about helping abused children or parents with AIDS or impoverished farmers. In a saga that began as an article for The Atlantic Monthly, author and journalist David Bornstein profiles Bill Drayton, who founded an organization to support social entrepreneurs and foster citizen involvement. The book is a unique treatment of an important subject, and therefore valuable. Organizationally, it suffers from the author's decision to chop up the Drayton story and interject profiles of social entrepreneurs between the segments. The technique would probably work well in a television documentary, but gets a bit disjointed here. That quibble aside, we highly recommend this very significant book to anyone who wants to make a difference.	2004-09-16

Frank's thesis is that runaway consumption of extravagant luxuries is a major problem in American society. This concept may have seemed more valid in 1999, at the height of the dot-com bubble, when the book first rolled off the presses, than it does in 2004. The intervening recession has done a lot to rearrange household consumption priorities. Yet one need only look at the houses, cars and home entertainment systems on the market to recognize that the thesis has not entirely lost all merit. For the more muscular theoretical foundation of this premise, readers are referred to the superior 100-year-old classic The Theory of the Leisure Class by Thorstein Veblen. Even in the shadow of that light, Frank's observations about the pressures to consume - especially the evidence that he marshals for an evolutionary compulsion to \\"keep up with the Joneses\\" - merits notice. While the author's proposed remedy of a consumption tax is sure to be controversial, we believe this book deserves to be read and appreciates its unusually stimulating, accessible writing on economics.	2004-09-16

Women not only rule the roost, they control its purse strings. In an economy 75% driven by individual consumer spending, women make decisions that affect 88% of all purchases and control almost half of all the households with assets of more than $500,000. The results of marketing research data show, in staggering and unequivocal terms, that women are the dominant demographic and financial engine behind the U.S. economy. The first half of author Bernice Kanner's book focuses on women's impact on various industries. The book's second half notes failed campaigns and explains what kind of marketing appeals to women. Despite its overwhelming reliance on marketing data, this book suffers from mixing the differences and similarities between the genders. At times the distinctions are clear, but often the differences get blurred. This extremely informative book would have benefited from tighter editing to make it less jumbled. Still, we think marketing and advertising executives can use this book to avoid chauvinist marketing pitfalls, adjust to changing demographics and more effectively draw female consumers to their clients' products.	2004-09-16

Author Kaihan Krippendorff, an expert on Sun Tzu and Chinese military strategy, applies the Chinese classic The 36 Stratagems to modern business thinking. Individually, the stratagems are rarely a revelation - the case studies show that many corporations already utilize them - but the larger point, that Eastern or Taoist thinking offers new options for the Western business strategist, is very useful and offers a real paradigm shift. Some of the stratagems need more discussion, and the connection between some stratagems and their accompanying case studies is shaky, but this is an excellent introduction to a neglected classic. Its strategies (an ethical minefield if you take them too literally) are not limited to battlefields or businesses. We recommend this book to business strategists, policymakers and those struggling with competition. It is also valuable for anyone working in or facing competition from East Asia, where these stratagems are already well known and widely used.	2004-09-16

Do you ever wish that you were born with an owner's manual? Well, Tiki Kustenmacher, simplicity expert, and Dr. Lothar J. Seiwert, professional coach, offer a digestible life guide that reads like an operating primer for the human spirit. Livened up with Kustenmacher's cute illustrations, each chapter tackles a different facet of life, such as managing clutter, taming finances and establishing goals. The practical tips from these bite-size chapters are easy to digest and implement. Their recipe for a simplified life includes valuable suggestions for handling difficult emotions (jealousy) and life events (marriage, death). Although the text is fun to read, the authors skip around and circle back to different subjects in each chapter. Tighter organization would have made the book's counsel easier to track. And, each chapter begins with an unnecessary, somewhat annoying \\"dream of simplicity\\" visualization. Just skip those little appetizers and dive right into the main course. Also check out the excellent reading list at the back of the book. We recommend this manual to pack rats, workaholics and all those who would welcome simplicity as a relief from life's chaos.	2004-09-16

This is a good business biography. The author has an eye for the interesting detail - such as the fact that the future chairman of Coca-Cola and the future Yankee-hating Communist leader Fidel Castro went to the same elite Cuban private school. He also has a good understanding of the business issues that Roberto Goizueta addressed during his remarkably successful career. This is not a hagiography or an \\"authorized\\" biography. In fact, author David Griesing reports that Goizueta opposed the book project and directed his friends and the public relations department of Coca-Cola not to cooperate. Remarkably, in the face of that opposition, the author not only persevered but also produced a book that seems scrupulously objective. If it is not a paen, neither is it a hatchet job. It's the real thing, and we find it well worth reading and recommending.	2004-09-16

This seminal book is a classic and ought to be read by anyone in business. Michael E. Porter's ideas on competitiveness have lost little relevance despite the fact that he first advanced them in this book in 1980. They have now become so much a part of business practice and business language that one reads the book more with a sense of recognition than a sense of discovery. His prose style is clear and straightforward, albeit somewhat plodding, and the book can tend to repeat itself. However, Porter's clarity is a welcome change from the murk you encounter in many other books on business strategy, and his repetition serves a useful pedagogical purpose. We highly recommend this excellent book. If you're in business, it's relevant.	2004-09-16

Dougherty has written a breezy tour of modern economics, concentrating on attempts to reconnect the dismal science with its roots in civil studies and moral philosophy. Although he is not an economist, he displays an easy familiarity with economics' big ideas and their authors, and communicates them with style and wit. Dougherty's knowledge of the field is broad, thanks to his decades of experience as an economics editor, but thankfully he does not bog readers down in the technical details. His book stresses the importance of social capital as well as the profit motive, and of strong civic institutions and communities as well as corporations. He offers a refreshing perspective in an era of corporate scandals and cautionary tales of greed. This slim volume contains no specific lessons that can be applied by individuals, but rather a dose of hope that capitalism can indeed encourage the best in people and companies, when institutions and incentives are properly designed by a democratic society.We  suggest this book to non-economists who want a quick course in the economic and social potential of democratic capitalism.	2004-09-16

Even after the dot-com boom and bust, software remains the business world's glamour industry. In this insightful study, professor and industry expert Michael A. Cusumano skips the glitz and goes straight for the nuts and bolts. The result is a clear rendering of exactly what makes one software firm hit it big while dozens of others go broke. Despite a slight, occasional tendency to sound academic, Cusumano really explains why a well-run software company can be a gold mine. He carefully covers the best practices in the software development industry in depth and offers plenty of real-world case histories to add juice to what could have been a dry recitation. He even explains why you have to hold on so long when you call a mass-market software firm's toll-free number. We recommend this detailed book to software pros seeking insight into their industry, as well as to investors and to those who like inside stories about entrepreneurial adventures.	2004-08-30

Hamish Pringle has written a thoughtful, crisply-paced book exploring the power of celebrity and how that power can be harnessed in marketing. The book focuses on the U.K. - thus, many of its case studies and celebrities will be unknown to those who haven't spent time in England - but its core message transcends national borders. Even those who have often had to deal with celebrities will still learn ample lessons, while those who have never dipped their toes in the celebrity marketing pool will find this essential reading. It is a textbook for avoiding many pitfalls of star marketing. We recommend this useful, insightful book to marketers and executives who are considering their first foray into the celebrity arena or re-thinking their use of celebrity marketing.	2004-08-30

Carly Fiorina is a controversial character who engineered one of the most contentious, notorious mergers in business history. Author George Anders has written a fast-paced, gripping to read, account of Ms. Fiorina's career, Hewlett-Packard's history and the controversial events surrounding the hard-fought merger. His account is quite friendly to Ms. Fiorina, and rarely criticizes her. Anders tilts noticeably against her antagonists, especially the curious Walter B. Hewlett, son of the company's co-founder and philanthropist. He had significant influence over the family foundation, but its fortunes depended on the fate of the company and HP stock. We find this narrative indispensable to understanding the history of the merger. It reveals high-level boardroom politics and maneuvering, and brings alive the breathtaking pace and fiery personalities involved. (And, if you want a contrasting view, a previous book, Backfire, promoted Walter B. Hewlett's side of the controversy.)	2004-08-30

The media and middle-class voters have blandly accepted tax cuts for the wealthy, thanks to the theory that the rich have paid more than their fair share of taxes for a long time. Nothing could be further from the truth, journalist David Cay Johnston convincingly argues. Using thorough research and startling examples, Johnston makes a persuasive case that the rich enjoy a free ride from Uncle Sam, while the middle class is saddled with an ever-increasing tax burden. Johnston takes you on a hair-raising tour of posh jets, corporate compensation committee meetings and IRS offices, piling up the evidence that the deck is stacked in favor of the rich. Johnston's strident tone grows a bit tiresome, yet the results of his reporting are sure to raise the blood pressure of anyone who hasn't benefited from a lucrative tax dodge. We recommend this trenchant book to anyone with an interest in creating a fairer U.S. tax system - or in living with the one they've got.	2004-08-30

Today's economy is service-oriented, so why don't more businesses focus on service? Maybe it's too obvious and beneath the scope of managers who focus on \\"managing up,\\" but the fact is that bad service translates into bad business. The way your business treats people should be based upon your understanding of how you would like to be treated. Isn't that just common sense (or the Golden Rule)? Maybe. But author T. Scott Gross offers many other pointers to help service-oriented people in all industries, including those who sell complex products and services. The author's advice and appraisals are based on a national survey of the attitudes that servers, managers and customers hold about service. Though slightly disorganized, the book is written in an entertaining, breezy style, (it even includes a recipe for barbecued ribs). Overall, we think the ideas presented here can enliven and re-vitalize any customer-oriented sales operation. Better yet: these suggestions can improve your bottom line.	2004-08-30

There was a big company with a stock price shooting for the stars and, then, suddenly there was a massive fraud, and the two things came so close together it was like hearing the explosion from a fireworks display after you've seen the light in the sky. Loren Fox's account was one of the first books about Enron and remains one of the best. The author is a skillful, diligent reporter who managed to get the story first and get it right, although Enron did not authorize his book or cooperate with him. His discussion of the company's complex, illegal accounting maneuvers is thorough and, if not quite clear, certainly complete. The book was written during the relatively early stages of the legal proceedings against the architects of the Enron fraud, so a lot of the material uncovered by Justice Department and SEC investigators was not yet available. The demerit of this is that Fox was not able to include much that is now common knowledge about Enron. However, we find that there is an advantage as well: Fox was not excessively guided or directed by common knowledge and conventional wisdom, but instead carved his own path through the thicket of Enron's weird and instructive history.	2004-08-30

The best and most useful part of this book comes near the end, where author Michael J. Gelb gets down to basics and offers instructions on how to juggle. The first part of the book consists of a series of exhortations and homilies about the advisability of relaxing, letting yourself make mistakes, practicing to be perfect and other personal attitude guidance. Those who thirst for such encouragement will find the first part of this book a godsend. It includes quotations from Lao Tse, Vince Lombardi and Leonardo da Vinci. All of the advice is highly meritorious, even the advice that you ought to take a break or two every day to juggle. That looks like fun whether you favor New Age nostrums or not. We recommend this book to anyone who must multi-task. Even if juggling doesn't smooth out your work life, at least it will help you relax.	2004-08-30

Jeters, a Mississippi business journalist, is readable though somewhat disorganized. You will come away with a better sense of the environment of good old boy networking that allowed Bernie Ebbers, a country motel operator, to become CEO of one of the hottest, most corrupt companies America ever produced. WorldCom, even more than Enron, epitomizes the greed, blindness and folly that afflicted the U.S. stock markets in the 1990s. The book needed a stronger editorial hand, but we on the whole finds it is a useful, illuminating addition to the sagas of Wall Street scandals.	2004-08-30

The New York Fire Department (FDNY) seemed a company of heroes in the months after September 11, 2001. Later, when investigations revealed the enormity of the blunders and the degree to which petty political infighting had literally doomed firefighters to death, the FDNY lost a bit of its luster. But FDNY traditionally has a core of strong leaders, and John Salka is one of them. In this book, he shares his leadership philosophy. It's no slur to observe that this is a leadership book for firehouse buffs who are as interested in firefighter yarns as in leadership. The leadership principles outlined here are sound but not new; what is fresh is that the author illustrates those principles with fire fighting stories, clearly far more interesting than war stories from accounting - even if a bit remote from most people's everyday business reality. After all, few business people risk their lives in their daily work, and probably no business has the esprit de corps of a firehouse. We recommend this book to business people across the professions. The ride inside the fire truck will keep you engrossed in its solid leadership lessons.	2004-08-30

Barry Eichengreen, one of the world's foremost economists, presents an illuminating, footnote-rich, reflection on the nature of financial crises and the need for systemic reform. Heretofore, official responses to financial crises have often made the problem of systemic vulnerability even worse. International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailouts of developing countries in crisis increase moral hazard by taking the pain of the consequences away from lenders and investors. The IMF effectively allows such investors to reap upside gains from risky ventures while they place responsibility for losses on the IMF itself. Market discipline needs to be the first line of defense against policies and practices that lead countries into crisis. But many political, institutional and financial players resist needed reforms. We congratulate Eichengreen for doing an excellent job of exploring what is necessary and distinguishing it from what is possible.	2004-08-05

Even if you're not a team player, this book will draft you in the first round. In plain language, author Gail Evans outlines the corporate playing field. She clearly marks the opponents, the cheerleaders and the goals women must conquer to score points in the corporate game. The book is at its best when Evans uses real-life examples to demonstrate the dramas, the discrimination and the disadvantages women face while working. Like a video of game highlights and lowlights, her examples are pulled from the pages of her own agenda book and e-mail box. She provides concrete tips to tell women how to establish and cultivate formal and informal networks. Although she does address the tug-of-war women survive while balancing home and work commitments, the book could have scored more points on the home front. Maybe Evans will do that for us next time - meanwhile, we recommend this book to women on all rungs of the corporate ladder.	2004-08-05

Author Alan Axelrod's 156 concise lessons on leadership from the life and writings of Harry S. Truman are vivid but, alas, often repetitive. The bigger paradox of this book is that many of the virtues it espouses - diligence, balance, thoroughness, patience and a thirst for learning - are thwarted by its very structure. Truman, a voracious reader, would likely have found these one or two page chapters frustratingly short. Any leader really seeking to model himself or herself on Truman should use this as an appetizer and move immediately onward to a meaty full-length biography or memoir. With that in mind, we recommend this book to executives and political leaders who haven't yet met Truman - or to those who only want a brief visit, a leadership pep talk and a few pithy quotes.	2004-08-05

Accomplished financial journalist Roger Lowenstein weaves a captivating tale in this history of the late 1990s market boom and subsequent bust. The story reads like a thriller, complete with powerful bad guys (played here by CEOs), innocent bystanders (ordinary investors) and hapless observers (ineffective government regulators). While it does not offer specific tips on avoiding fraud or implementing change on Wall Street - indeed, the author admits that real change in that bastion of enlightened self-interest may be impossible - this book is a valuable cautionary tale. Lowenstein traces the evolution of creative accounting practices that blossomed into blatant fraud and eventual bankruptcy, finally forcing the notoriously pro-business Bush administration into pushing for corporate governance reform. Along the way, he exposes the myths of the dot-com era and deconstructs the sham of shareholder value. He makes trenchant observations about a financial culture that allowed the ultra rich to get richer, while fully half of Americans never participated in the boom or benefited from it, although everyone paid the price of the bust. We recommend this book to anyone who lost money when the bubble burst - better luck next time.	2004-08-05

He culminated his career as CEO of Merck, a giant company whose employees used to take lunch breaks at the store where he swept the floors as a boy. This is an inspiring tale, but not directly instructive. The author offers no tips for doctors, scientists or executives, nor does he address most of the current hot-button issues facing pharmaceutical companies. Vagelos simply, matter-of-factly presents the story of one man's life and achievements, without preaching or teaching. He does offer insights into scientific research (maybe too many, but this is his passion), into competitive hiring and into his management approach. His discussion of Merck's public health initiatives provides a much-needed counterpoint to the bad press the pharmaceutical industry has received in recent years. We suggest this book to those interested in Merck's history, in the pharmaceutical industry, in biochemistry or in a perfect example of an American immigrant's rise to success.	2004-08-05

Those who say, &quot;Good grief, not another book on management,&quot; may rest assured that this volume is worth careful study. Author Joan Magretta and collaborator Nan Stone offer advice based on decades of business experience and, yet, they distill the obnoxious &quot;consultant-speak&quot; so common to the field to clearly understandable, conversational terms. While at times they may seem to have a firm grasp on the obvious - investments are risky and managers need to make good choices - their work is fundamentally sound overall, offering practical case studies and real-world examples. This book takes common business concepts such as the &quot;80-20 Rule,&quot; shines an insightful light upon them and then advances into more complex ground. We recommend this broad, new perspective on the growing social importance of effective management.	2004-08-05

Increasingly, management is holding marketing departments responsible for making expensive mistakes and not contributing to profits. What's worse, marketers do not seem able to reverse the tide. That's where professor Philip Kotler's concise handbook becomes valuable. Kotler presents commonsense solutions to these problems by describing his version of the 10 deadly marketing sins and how to atone for them. He cites specific examples to drive home his points. This breezy, easy book is devoted to giving marketing practitioners advice that enables them to regain the high ground and lift marketing back into prominence in the corporate hierarchy. If you want to market your products, your department and your career, we suggest inviting Prof. Kotler over for this little chat.	2004-08-05

According to the authors and contributors, the example of Jesus Christ contains indispensable lessons for leadership. However, in the Gospel, Jesus seems to have commanded disciples primarily to love God and one another. He never seems to have promised success in worldly business affairs or to have offered managerial precepts. On the other hand, in the parable of talents he taught his followers to be fiscally conservative and to invest wisely. To their credit, the authors and editors who compiled this book acknowledge that Christianity never set itself up specifically as a recipe for business success. Regardless, they conclude, that applying precepts they identify will lead to success. The leadership guidelines they quote make sense and do not exclude thoughtful businesspeople of any theological background. The authors illustrate their advice with amusing, instructive anecdotes. The counsel is accessible, ethically illuminating and personally inspiring, although if you usually skip the sermon, it may not be for you. We believe that its primary appeal will be to Christians who seek to serve as servant leaders in their communities and workplaces.	2004-08-05

Warren Buffett is a legendary financial wizard who has built a fortune based on the principles of value investing. Many volumes have been written about his investing approach, but Robert P. Miles' treatise is a bit different from most of the others. The author is obviously a great fan of Buffett - at times, the book borders on plutocratic hagiography - but his all-encompassing admiration lends his work a distinctive tone. Reading this exposition is like hearing a star-struck fan discuss the techniques of a favorite movie star. Dazed admiration helps Miles see patterns, connections and details about Warren Buffett that you might not find in a more objective or more focused tome. If you want a nitty-gritty, pros and cons analysis of Buffett's investing style, go elsewhere. If a down-home and frankly admiring analysis, complete with investing advice based on Buffett's principles, is more your style, we assure you, you've come to the right place.

This very extensive text on customer relationship management leaves nothing unsaid or unexplained. Authors and editors Don Peppers and Martha Rogers tackle the subject with admirable organization, clarity and depth. They define every important term and do not lose the reader in marketing jargon - a rare virtue in a book about marketing. The text, including contributions from other well-known experts in the field, propounds a well-developed theory of customer relationship management (CRM) and sets out numerous examples to illustrate, explain and clarify the theory. Useful as a handbook, textbook or reference manual, the book covers - among many other core subjects - customer identification and differentiation, customer feedback, an analysis of retailing and basic tools for CRM. We highly recommend this book to service-oriented managers and executives. To form profitable relationships with your customers, first get friendly with Peppers and Rogers.	2004-08-05

Mother-and-daughter authors Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Warren Tyagi tell the frightening tale of a rising tide of bankruptcies and financial difficulties in middle-class America. Their statistics show that families with children, including single parent families, are hardest hit by this epidemic. The authors, who make no pretence of objectivity, blame corporate greed and government neglect. Their politically improbable proposals include school vouchers removing geography as a placement criteria and the re-regulation of lending. The book doesn't ever really define its pivotal audience, the &quot;middle class.&quot; It trusts your conventional wisdom about what it means to be middle-class, while passionately questioning conventional wisdom about consumer debt. Yet, despite the book's flaws, the authors make a thought-provoking, eye-opening argument about lending practices and they issue clear warnings about debt. We recommend this book to families, and to anyone concerned about social justice, family-friendly policies and consumer debt.	2004-08-04

Anyone who has ever driven a BMW wonders why the car feels so uncannily nimble and supple. Automotive journalist David Kiley answers that question with an intriguing book that strikes just the right balance between gearhead details, behind-the-scenes corporate maneuvering and compelling story telling. Along the way, Kiley offers insight into BMW's mostly successful efforts to build its brand. While Kiley sings BMW's praises, and presents a convincing case that BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke AG) produces the world's best cars, he doesn't shy away from the details of the owning family's ups and downs, the company's disastrous Rover deal or the public's tepid response to its latest redesigns. We recommend this fascinating book to auto enthusiasts and to managers in any industry who aim to build a brand while staying true to their core values.	2004-08-04

Sicco Van Gelder has written the definitive textbook on analyzing global branding strategy. Packed with examples, in-depth case studies and hypothetical branding projects, this book will prove useful to companies entering global markets or launching global brands. From the stunning worldwide success of the Sony Walkman to the dismal global failure of New Coke, Van Gelder scrutinizes the factors that shape a global brand. He issues a timely reminder that local cultures and consumers differ, and that branding must account for local differences in multiple markets. Note that this is a textbook, not a manual. The author explains his &quot;global brand proposition model&quot; in minute detail, which can get a little dense and repetitive at times. While the final chapters contain several useful illustrations of the analytical model in action, this is not a how-to book. Nevertheless, we believe this thoughtful tome deserves a spot on the reference shelf of brand specialists and marketers, as well as the executives of any company that operates in more than one country.	2004-08-04

This is a very good book about investing and market behavior. Readers should be forewarned that author John Mauldin may have some bias in that he is an advisor and money manager with a big commodities practice. Nevertheless, pay close attention to his evidence and the case he expounds here. Mauldin marshals numerous studies to indicate that a secular extended bear market is upon us and that it may be a long, long time before stock markets recover strength and surpass their present levels in inflation-adjusted terms. He suggests that a further drop of as much as 50% may be in the cards and, in case you aren't already scared, he supports his contention with solid evidence. Mauldin offers you a number of plausible alternatives for managing your money. We find that one of his book's great merits is that it calls attention to a potentially dark scenario that most investment coverage ignores.	2004-08-04

This book is like a Toyota vehicle: not necessarily fancy, but extraordinarily capable of getting you from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B.&quot; Author Jeffrey K. Liker's thorough insight into the continual improvement method known as &quot;The Toyota Way&quot; reflects his experience with the Toyota Production System (TPS) and his knowledge of its guiding philosophies and its technical applications. He explains why Toyota has become a global symbol of passionate commitment to continual improvement and efficiency. Toyota's success as the world's most profitable automaker is no accident and now, thanks to this book, it's no mystery, either. Liker drills down to the underlying principles and behaviors that will set your company on the Toyota Way. The book reflects years of studying Toyota's philosophy: it is well mapped out, straightforward and exceedingly although not daringly innovative. We highly recommend it to anyone striving to improve their organization's operational efficiency.	2004-08-04

Given how heavily companies spend on advertising and merchandising, any factor - in this case, better use of branding - that could possibly enhance the survival chances of a product extension deserves serious consideration. In fact, if you are thinking about launching a new product tied to an existing brand, this informative book might save your career. Author David Taylor identifies so many prerequisites for making a brand offshoot successful that you may decide to take up some safer activity - like bungee jumping. That cautionary guidance alone is invaluable. Unlike many other marketing authors, Taylor writes concise chapters, liberally dosed with good examples. Each chapter ends with a summary, checklist and pertinent takeout. The package works well to convey Taylor's provocative ideas. To avoid embarrassing product failures, read this book. We warmly recommend it to those daring enough to be branding and product-marketing specialists.	2004-08-04

Enron is, of course, old news by now. The company went bankrupt in 2001, and its spectacular collapse was merely the first of a series of notorious corporate scandals. Most of the story Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind tell in their book has already appeared in newspaper and magazine accounts and in other, rush-to-publish books that hit the market during or shortly after the events described. However, these authors have assembled what may be the single most comprehensive, detailed account and written it like an anecdote-rich, lively business-based novel. We do wish they had included a timeline and a list of sources, since they have had the benefit of being able to draw on all of that other work, on indictments and on testimony before courts and Congress, but their account is engrossing and complete. If you read just one book on the Enron scandal, we believe this may be the book to read.	2004-08-04

The great changes that will alter the commercial, political and demographic workings of the world are already underway and some of their consequences are quite predictable, says author Peter Schwartz. He outlines a variety of the more important changes, particularly in places such as China and India, and limns scenarios that represent possible futures. Perhaps this sort of book is inevitable at the turning of a century, of a millennium. The author, in fact, compares his work to predecessors at the end of the nineteenth century. Although some of his predictions fall far short of shocking - for example, global warming and aging populations are hardly undiscovered issues - the exercise of thinking about scenarios and preparing strategies is a good one. The book is also entertaining, because Schwartz writes with a light hand and a casual style. We believe this book would be a good airplane read. It would certainly be appropriate for a long flight, since air travel contributes to some of the more important changes the author discusses. And, if you read it, the time will fly.	2004-08-04

Re-engineering, downsizing TQM, CRM - you've seen them all. But businesses are still trying to find ways to lead their markets and beat their competition. The authors of this book suggest that pricing deserves the kind of attention that, a decade ago, your organization lavished upon procurement. They believe pricing strategy will be the important competitive differentiator in times to come. That is certainly plausible, and this book offers extensive guidance on how, when, why and according to what guiding principles businesses should change prices. Its copy editors should have been more diligent, because spelling and grammatical errors abound, but the book is nonetheless surprisingly readable. The book makes some valuable points, and we believe it merits marketing officers' scrutiny.	2004-08-03

This polemic is a must-read whether you love or hate neo-conservatives. Authors Stefan Halper and Jonathan Clarke provide a comprehensive history of the neo-conservative movement, and outline every conceivable charge against them. The authors fervently contend that neo-cons have led the United States into a war with Iraq and have done immense damage to America's liberties, its reputation abroad and its moral integrity. People who love neo-conservatives should read this book to learn the worst that can be said about them so that they can prepare responses, especially during an election year. People who hate neo-conservatives should read this book because it will reconfirm their deepest prejudices and animosities. However, we caution, people who are neutral on neo-cons will find this book something of a hard go - the authors have an axe to grind, and grind away they do. They offer strong views and information tinged with passion, so if you find yourself elated - or deeply annoyed - write to them...and not to us.	2004-08-03

Managers, the haves, set the rules and rule over the have-nots or peons. A few hundred years ago, peons tilled land they did not own, and got paid with enough of the crop they raised to feed themselves. Since even today peons are the ones who actually do all the work, a manager's success depends on the peons' support. What's the best way to enlist the support of the peons who work for you? Ask a peon! That's the straightforward premise of this book, which delivers what it promises. Author Dave Haynes offers advice to management straight from those uniform Dilbertesque cubicles - and management should listen. To motivate workers, demonstrate integrity, avoid being two-faced and treat your peons as equals. Even better, roll up your sleeves occasionally and work alongside them. They'll love you for it. We highly recommend this book to managers at all levels. What it lacks in trendy consultant-speak and analysis, it more than makes up for in blue-collar denim truth.	2004-08-03

If you study any complex issue being debated in the U.S. Congress or state legislatures, you are likely to find a torrent of reports from independent think tanks. Who are these groups and where did they come from? Good question - and one that political scientist Andrew Rich answers quite thoroughly. This often fascinating study shines its bright light on think tanks, largely overlooked players in the political process. At times, though, Rich's study tantalizes with generalizations, and then it tends toward scholarly restraint at exactly the moment when the reader wants some juicy details. We suggest this book to anyone who wants to shape - or really understand - the public debate on complex policy issues.	2004-08-03

Paul Davies offers a very thoughtful, useful and interesting look at how to outsource overseas. Davies taught for nine years and has a Ph.D. in English focused on the novels of George Eliot. He also served as Managing Director of Unisys in India. The book reflects his varied expertise and idiosyncrasies. Both his left and right brains are well developed, and the competition between the two plays out in the pages of his book. At times it reads like a management consultant's manual on the growing practice of &quot;offshoring.&quot; At other times, it reads like a very perceptive travel book that guides executives on what to expect when they encounter the culture shock of India. The effect is not disjointed, however, and this volume would be valuable for any firm considering an offshore effort in India and, probably, in other countries as well. Because Davies gives you a good overview of what you will encounter when you outsource, as well as practical business advice. We highly recommend his book for those who are considering moving aspects of their businesses overseas, especially to India.	2004-08-03

Author and historian William J. Bernstein is an explainer, so put on your village thinking cap. This sprawling book skips over a broad surface of economic history, theology, sociology, engineering, politics and mechanics, like a flat pebble over a smooth pond. Readers with scant grounding in these disciplines can still have a good time as they gaze slightly slack-jawed at this colorful, fast-moving assemblage of facts, theories and prejudices, all mixed, mingled and as surprising as a carnival parade. Readers who know these subjects, on the other hand, will relish the sweep of Bernstein's saga even if they balk at the inevitable simplifications, exaggerations, contradictions and foggy facts that result from compressing world economic history into 400 pages. Bernstein arranges his history around the four pillars that, he says, support continual economic growth: property rights, the scientific method, capital markets and communications. Given that framework, his presentation is logical and lively. We liked this entertaining read, which is imbued with a history buff's excitement.	2004-08-03

Former President Bill Clinton once remarked that running against an incumbent president is like an extended job interview with the American people. First you must convince them to vote the other fellow out of office, and then you must convince them that you would be a suitable replacement. In some ways this book is John Kerry's extended epistle to the American people, explaining why he's the right man for the job. Author Kerry demonstrates an impressive grasp of the issues, and yet explains them in a Clintonesque, common-sense manner. The book uses italicized anecdotes from Kerry's past, pastiches cleverly woven throughout its fabric, to give the reader a sense of Kerry's past without dwelling on it. This is much more a book about the future, and Kerry's vision for America and how he intends to achieve it. We recommend this most highly for those who seek a better understanding of the man carrying the Democratic banner into the electoral battle.	2004-08-03

Imagine a guidebook that helps you navigate the uncharted lands of strange cultures or, at least, cultures that seem strange to you. Author Brooks Peterson is less concerned with social advice than he is with explaining how to manage broad cultural differences and avoid cultural egocentrism. While he soundly reviews measures of cultural differences, such as cultural scales, he avoids delving into complex, abstract theories with little practical application. His clearly written book treats all cultures objectively, covering broad tendencies without venturing into cultural generalities. He alerts you to the nuances of other cultures and your own. We strongly recommend this book to anyone who interacts with the values of other cultures on a regular basis - and, these days, that's just about everybody.	2004-08-03

Authors Chetan Sharma and Yasuhisa Nakamura diligently track the development of the most important wireless technologies and standards, sketch the anatomy of the value chain and make some informed judgments about the future direction of various wireless industry segments. They also examine the social and cultural influence of wireless. The book is refreshingly free of the hype and hucksterism that characterizes so many books about the business of technology. However, some readers will find its relentless focus and its scrupulously neutral prose hard to take in any but small doses. We highly recommend this book to anyone in the wireless industry whose job demands an understanding of the field's broader business and technological context. The lengthy list of industry abbreviations and acronyms is a particularly valuable feature.	2004-08-03

The book jacket bills author Tony Jeary as &quot;coach to America's top CEOs.&quot; It doesn't identify them, but the author clearly has a certain bold presentational style, and stressing his identity as a expert coach could be both a strategic and an educational tactic. The book's content is evergreen, a mixture of hortatory slogans and amusing anecdotes, all designed to make you a better presenter - whether your audience is one listener or an auditorium full of people. The author's advice is, for the most part, solid, detailed, practical and conservative. Don't be too put off by a few dated examples (Bill Clinton and Gary Condit) and if you're pressed for time just read the handy lists of &quot;very important points&quot; that close each chapter. We assure you that you can't waste time reading this book. It's that useful.	2004-08-03

This book aims to show CEOs how to achieve the impossible. Based on a study of 70 companies that managed to accomplish incredibly ambitious goals, it offers a straightforward and, for the most part, lucid set of guiding principles to reach breakthrough success. Author Bill Davidson anchors his prescription in the experiences of real companies and illustrates each point with copious anecdotes. Although he strays now and then into the jargon of the academic tribe, these digressions are rare and excusable. His case histories and tactical advice offer something of value to every CEO or senior manager. We  recommend this book to executives whose companies are trapped in strategic dead-ends and desperate to blast out, or to executives who would rather act before a crisis really blossoms.	2004-08-03

This book falls into the Trout tradition. Although some of his core points - protect your differentiation, avoid jargon, focus tightly - have been said before, frequently by him, he has a good salesman's way of making it seem fresh and exciting. A reminder of certain basic, important verities is often useful, no matter how established they are. Trout is best in intense doses and much of what he has to say here, while not complicated, is true, practical and useful. Any marketer who reads this book will learn something of value. We find it a worthwhile addition to the promoter's library as a motivational handbook, a memory jogger or a collection of short servings of solid advice.	2004-08-03

This book, first published in 1979, is still timely and useful, though it shows a few signs of age. It's hard to believe that any Americans in the CNN age are quite as ignorant of the world abroad as they were in the 1970s. However, diversity training and exposure to Thai and Mexican cuisine only goes so far to inoculate Americans against their own inherent cultural assumptions. Yes, this is written for people from the United States and addressed to them directly, but it would be useful to any sojourner trying to shake off hometown assumptions and adapt to life abroad. This volume treats every reader as a neophyte, a Dorothy in the Land of Oz. Author L. Robert Kohls offers a useful series of self-tests and questionnaires, psychological and anthropological frameworks, and practical guidance on routine matters. The book, which is engagingly written, with a wry and sometimes ironic touch, also contains useful appendices. We believe that it merits a place in the library of anyone, particularly any American, who is taking an overseas assignment, however brief.	2004-08-03

Davidson Frame provides just about the last word on competence. His book covers every facet, from the need for competence to how to achieve it on an individual, team and organizational basis. His timely and important treatise is well organized, exact and brimming with inside expertise. However, its personality is very much that of a textbook; the information is dense, clear and interesting, but not chatty. Frame explains how to recruit, hire, retain, encourage, promote and reward people and groups who know what they're doing. He explains what might be wrong with your organization if it thwarts competence instead of nurturing it. He covers methods of measuring specific achievements and skills, including professional standards in project management and actual assessment tests for individuals, teams and organizational projects. The quest to achieve, build and measure competence is a growing trend in business. Read this detailed book and you will know why. We recommend it to project managers and to all those concerned about employee competence. It takes the entire conversation to a more professional level.	2004-07-28

This book was a publishing phenomenon in the early 1990s, and it deserved to be. Stephen R. Covey managed to repackage an ethical and moral tradition thousands of years in development and make it meaningful to a late twentieth century, secular audience. Most of what you find in this book you will find in Aristotle, Cicero, Benedict, Tillotson and their heirs. Covey adds a few references to psychology, a twentieth century science, and many to Viktor Frankl, a sage of the Holocaust. Covey wraps the mix in a distinctively American can-do program of easy-looking steps calling, mostly, for self-discipline. The result is a quite worthwhile, useful manual for self-improvement. We believe most readers can learn something useful from this book, though some will find the style too familiar and easy-going, and the prescriptions easier to agree with than to act upon, much less adopt as habits.	2004-07-28

Author Lex Rieffel writes with authority on the history of developing countries' debt crises. He describes this difficult and complex subject concisely and meticulously. To be sure, he wrote this text as an argument for a specific policy objective (keeping flexibility in the sovereign debt workout process), and does not shy away from hammering his point home multiple times. However, his agenda in no way diminishes the accuracy of his history or his factual descriptions of the entities that shaped it. The first four chapters are an excellent primer on the subject, and could stand alone. The later chapters provide a wealth of detail, perfect for those who need it, albeit a bit tedious for anyone not directly involved in sovereign lending. We recommend this book to bankers involved in making loans to foreign countries, to government policymakers in borrower countries and lender countries, and to anyone seeking a detailed exploration of how countries pay their debts.	2004-07-28

People start small businesses for many reasons. Sometimes they're in love with the product - they've always wanted to open a store where amateur potters could buy great mud. Sometimes they've been itching to run free from life in a big corporation and finally quit to start their own shop. Sometimes they get a pink slip and a bit of severance pay, and can't find another job, so they decide to start their own business. Whatever the reason, small business owners encounter some common problems. People who are in love with a product may forget how important customers are. People who've worked for a big corporation may not realize how many support services they have learned to take for granted. People who've run their small business for years may get in a rut and miss opportunities to grow. Author Jeffrey J. Fox's short, easy-to-read handbook of pithy counsel is for all of them. While his brightly-written advice sounds fresher than it is, we find it well worth remembering.	2004-07-28

Leibowitz, the authors of this slim volume, accomplish a tough feat. They utter a piece of rudimentary financial advice in one sentence and then launch into mind-bending explanations of the calculus that makes the rudiments true. Maybe that's why their 1972 classic has been in print for three decades. This updated version of the classic includes new forewords and some material that was cut from the original. Unless you're an experienced bond trader or a finance whiz, this primer isn't exactly easy reading. The authors waste little time on hand-holding. Still, it remains a complete look at its topic after all these years. We suggest this book to investors and traders who need a crash course - or a refresher course - in bond analysis.	2004-07-28

This excellent short book has implications far beyond its titular subject. Although ostensibly about the effect of computers on labor, it provides a model for thinking in economically rational terms about any kind of innovation that offers lower costs or greater efficiency. In a nutshell, scaremongers tend to exaggerate the threats and underestimate the benefits of such innovations. Some prognosticators, for example, predicted massive unemployment, poverty and social unrest due to employment disruptions stemming from computers. Why? Because computers could do many jobs, especially automated ones, faster and better. Something like the classical economic notion of comparative advantage is at work: computers and people should each do what they are good at. On the other hand, the authors analyze how innovation leaves many low-level, unskilled workers behind, and explain how and why the haves must make reasonable, just provisions for the have-nots. We believe that any reader who appreciates lucid analysis and clear prose will enjoy this book, and will gain understanding and perspective.	2004-07-28

The problem with the corporate fixation on bigness is that size often brings a less desirable quality: unresponsiveness. That helps explain why the lifespan of the average Fortune 500 corporation is about 50 years. Now comes author Joel M. Shulman to suggest a mechanism your company can use to avoid that burnout lifecycle. In a sophisticated book targeted to tactical thinkers, he proposes that you consider the Strategic Entrepreneurial Unit (SEU). He explains that establishing a diverse portfolio of small-scale entrepreneurial enterprises within a parent organization can help convert a large, unwieldy corporation into a more enterprising, forward-looking company. And, then, he tells you how. This capably written, insightful manual is very soundly based on practical business realities and experience. We recommend it highly to business strategists and executives who guide the long-term well being of their companies.	2004-06-29

In this very good beginner's guide to the bond market, author Michael V. Brandes addresses all of the fundamental questions clearly and concisely. Bond math can be daunting, but while the author includes a few equations for illustrative purposes, he clearly addresses his book to the general run of individual investors. The book, which has moments of surprising good humor, says right off the bat that bond investing can be dull in comparison to stock investing, not because the stakes are lower, but because the elements of personality and surprise are considerably more muted in the debt market than in the equity markets. We highly recommend this book, even though it is pedantic at times - a risk you take when you venture into the complex realm of bond investing.	2004-06-29

The best investing principles, as clearly reiterated here, are stable and evergreen. As an investor, you'll welcome author Pat Dorsey's unambiguous, straightforward presentation of the always valid wisdom of the markets. This conveniently organized book offers several chapters of general relevance to investors in all markets and industries, including an industry-by-industry examination of the determinants of value. The title is cute, but the content isn't about the title's rules - it is about learning and obeying the basics of stock investing. We recommend the author's long term perspective. Many of the directions he sets for potential investments could still be valid years hence.	2004-06-29

He tells you why you shouldn't trust them, and then shows you how to apply a skeptic's perspective to figuring out what reported numbers really mean. The market for investment books is a crowded one, but this is a standout: a thoroughgoing and systematic combination of curiosity, knowledge and prudent suspicion. We highly recommend this book to all investors.

Being an entrepreneur who sells a brand name product in a consumer-conscious marketplace is an appealing way to make a living. It must be: the U.S. franchise market hit $1 trillion in sales in 2003. But franchising is a deceptively complex business for both the franchisee and for the franchiser who creates the idea, builds the brand, tunes the delivery system and maintains sensitive franchisee relationships. Franchisers build, deconstruct and syndicate businesses to those who may lack the experience to offer a specific service or product. Entrepreneurs with business acumen and a keen desire to build something for themselves often find that franchising offers many ways to create wealth. This meaty book thoroughly explains how you can succeed in a franchise business. Its nuts-and-bolts presentation is enlivened by case studies from Jiffy Lube, Bagelz, Dunkin' Donuts, Subway, Pizza Hut and McDonald's. We recommend it as essential reading for anyone considering buying or starting a franchise.	2004-06-29

Mitnick, a corporate security consultant who was once arrested for computer hacking, has written a fascinating book about how to control security lapses due to the \\"human element.\\" With writer William L. Simon, he describes how con artists use social engineering to gain information by lying to pass themselves off as insiders. By being sensitive to human behavior and taking advantage of trust, they learn to bypass your security systems. The book teaches you how to ward off such threats and educate employees. Yet, problematically, this information could also help con artists be more sophisticated. In any case, this highly informative, engaging book includes sample conversations that open the door to information, along with tips about how various cons are used and what to do about them. We recommend this book to corporate officers, information managers, human resource getAbstract. directors and security personnel, but don't tell anybody.	2004-06-22

Patrick Lencioni offers a satisfactory fable about an executive wrestling to take hold of a company and create a smoothly functioning executive team. The narrative moves right along as he addresses the problem of feckless teamwork with the fictitious Decision Tech company as a test case. The novel is interesting, and you can read through it easily, getting to know the characters and participating in their business decisions. However, if you just want to learn about better teamwork quickly and leave, skim to the final chapters. Here, the author outlines a detailed model for diagnosing the five dysfunctions of a team and provides exercises and techniques to ameliorate those dysfunctions. The advice is complete and concrete. We recommend the meat and potatoes diagnosis and solutions as well as the cake and ice cream story, but how much narrative you want to read may depend on what shape your team is in when you start, as well as on your taste for tales.	2004-06-22

Charlie Munger's life story is a version of the classic American Dream: a hard-working young man builds a billion-dollar fortune through hard work and honest business deals, all the while raising eight children with the help of an intelligent, devoted wife. Author Janet Lowe brings this story and Munger's personality to life with well-chosen anecdotes from family, friends and business associates. These include, most notably, Warren Buffett, with whom she already enjoyed a rapport thanks to her work on a previous bestseller, Warren Buffett Speaks. Because Munger's business history is so complex, the chapters are organized thematically rather than strictly chronologically, which can be a bit confusing. Thankfully, Lowe provides a handy timeline in an appendix. We suggest this book to investors, Buffett fans (who may underestimate the contributions others such as Munger have made to the Berkshire Hathaway empire) and to those dismayed by corporate corruption who could use this tale of honest success to renew their faith in capitalism.	2004-06-22

The authors are all psychologists who specialize in leadership issues. They have written conversationally and intelligently, using plenty of sidebar material (even famous cartoons) to bring their reporting to life. We recommend this classic (now in its third edition) to everyone interested in leadership.	2004-06-22

The advent of the publicly owned media conglomerate has left busy, multi-tasking reporters more dependent than ever on stories pitched by people, like you, who are looking for media placement. Full Frontal PR is an insider's look at how to make your story sing and dance in the mass media. The modern era requires hype, spin, guerilla marketing, buzz and hard core understanding of the media intake biz. The book's core lesson: how to get people to talk about you, your product and your service - the most important element in any PR campaign. Here's how to establish yourself as an expert source, so reporters get in the habit of calling you for quotes. Media veterans may have to dig for new ideas, but they are in here. However, we particularly suggest this manual of media manipulation to entry and mid-level PR managers who want to know more about creating that buzz.	2004-06-22

Deeply informed by his marketing experience at Coca-Cola, Sergio Zyman knows advertising theories, but he doesn't like them. He is marketing's angry child, shouting, \\"Traditional advertising just isn't working.\\" He delights in hurling stones at traditional advertising icons, including \\"brand awareness,\\" which may get your product considered, but will not guarantee a sale or an increase in sales. For sales heft, he postulates, position your product to be relevant to the consumer. Build this \\"brand relevance,\\" then start working on media buzz. He compliments his own marketing expertise, but who wants a shy promoter? He says corporations waste ad dollars, so if you work in a traditional glass-house advertising agency, you won't feel too secure when you see angry kid Zyman picking up a rock. His targets, according to us, are people who work in Madison Avenue glass houses, and those who hire them.	2004-06-22

Greg Elmer pulls the veil off the universal practice of consumer profiling and data-collection, and demonstrates its deep societal influence. Daily, when you swipe a credit card or buy a magazine or go online, your personal habits are monitored - and someone will use that information to make a buck. Both in terms of its topic and its treatment, this book should be too theoretical to hold much interest for the business public. Who cares about communications theory as applied to the continual mapping of personal consumer information? However, you can't push this into a dusty corner, because the subtle cultural effect of the increasingly close monitoring and data mining of consumer behavior is too powerful to overlook. While the book has a slightly dry, academic direction, we still strongly recommend it to those who are curious whether the juggernaut economic machine will steamroll over the privacy rights of those who use and feed it.	2004-06-22

Author Raoul Felder is one of New York's most famous divorce lawyers. He moves in elite company and counts movie stars, big shot executives and political heavyweights among his clients and antagonists. He didn't get to that point by being a shrinking violet. This book is full of interesting if promotional anecdotes that attempt to position the author not only as a ruthless negotiator, but also as the right sort of fellow. That's a tough balance to strike, particularly since some of his tactics are outrageous, albeit effective. As celebrity memoirs go, this is a pretty good one, written in short episodes with glamorous client insider stories. And, as negotiations manuals go, it's quite strategic, even if weighted somewhat toward divorce issues. Felder manages to dish the dirt, we find, while also serving up useful advice about gloves-off negotiations.	2004-06-22

Books	5	1	2	N	N	Packed With Knowledge!	In Unleashing the Ideavirus, Seth Godin says your idea is contagious, like the flu. But hold on - he's not being insulting. If you think of your idea as a virus, says he, you can \\"infect\\" the marketplace by motivating customers to talk about your product. He stretches this metaphor to explain how to captivate powerful \\"sneezers\\" so they will spread the word. Not a pretty picture, if you are a literal type of person, but you get the concept. For the right product or service, this is an alternative to advertising (or, as Godin calls it, \\"interruption marketing\\"). Though he builds on multi-level marketing concepts, Godin distances himself from their negative image. He writes in a breezy, easy style, with examples, charts and illustrations. If you want to spread the word about this book, we suggest that you just cough politely on someone in marketing, advertising or sales.	2004-06-22

Sargent and François R. Velde offer a fascinating work of scholarship that studies the history of coinage in broad scope and depth. They dwell on a problem that is no longer a problem: the set value of coins. Internationally, consumers take it for granted that so many units of small change equal a larger unit of money. A U.S. shopper never wonders if 100 pennies could be worth more or less than a dollar. But during most of history, the value of small change was a vexing economic conundrum. The authors explore the evolution of the monetary system from Roman times, taking a circuitous and rambling path that touches on many subjects, from sieges to papal speculations. Regrettably, this book may be inaccessible to readers without a firm grounding in economic history and some comfort with higher math since the authors are scholars and assume that you are, too. Nonetheless, we recommend this sweeping book to anyone whose curiosity is piqued by this pr&eacute;cis.	2004-06-22

Susan Antilla presents a powerful and startling indictment of the sexist behavior of stock brokers working for Wall Street and its offshoots, specifically Smith Barney's Shearson/American Express office in Garden City, Long Island. Women struggled to be hired, and then found that the men in charge of their careers practiced all sorts of sexual harassment and intimidation, from jokes to displays of sexual prowess, physical contact and threats of rape. As she describes, the bosses sought to bar women or trap them in low positions. While painting the broader picture, Antilla focuses on whistle blower, Pam Martens, who revealed the situation when she sued for damages. This skillfully written book reads like a fascinating novel, so graphic and dramatic that it is more like a screenplay than a report. We believe it will draw intense interest from everyone affected by this issue: female executives who face glass ceilings and harassment, male executives who must determine their own philosophies toward their female colleagues and human resource professionals who are charged with watching out for them both.	2004-06-16

Co-authors Rick Frishman and Jill Lublin join Jay Conrad Levinson, author of the 1983 bestseller Guerrilla Marketing, in establishing the war plan for your guerrilla approach to publicity. You supply the planning and persistence; they'll supply the battlefield strategy. The authors take you into the newsrooms and show you how to generate publicity without making reporters dread your calls. You'll learn how to turn rejections into opportunities and how to muster every tool in your arsenal most effectively, from press releases to e-mail. It's a little too list-oriented, but this thorough manual does include plenty of sample materials, including bios, press kit components and printed promotional goodies.

As a consumer group, women represent an enormous opportunity, but chances are your company is missing out on them. Author Martha Barletta says most marketers fail to capitalize on this lucrative market. They don't realize its potential or understand fundamental gender differences. As a result, their marketing fails to communicate with women, let alone persuade them. Barletta, a consultant specializing in marketing to women consumers, offers a book heavy on theory and long on detail. Except for a few examples of how ads are executed, the book lacks case studies that would bring these theories to life. Still, Barletta provides good advice on practical applications of these ideas about gender culture. She sheds light on the myths and realities of marketing to women, and provides essays by female experts in the field. What a pity that it all reads like a textbook. Given that, we target this rather educational tome as more appropriate for people who study marketing than for people who do marketing, although thoughtful marketers might still want to take a look	2004-06-16

Management consultant Paul Glen's thorough discussion of geeks brings you brain-to-brain and eye-to-eye with high-tech, specialized knowledge workers. Don't blink: you need these people, so you need to know how to fit your management style to them. Glen describes their primary personality traits and attitudes: commitment to logic, interest in problem solving, independence and, to put it politely, occasionally under-developed social skills. The author, who doesn't seem to mind describing an entire subset of the labor force as if each worker in it had the same personality, explains what geeks need from a manager. You need to nurture motivation, provide internal facilitation, furnish external representation, and manage task, structural, and environmental ambiguity. We suggest this organized, authoritative guide to those who manage knowledge workers. If it's all geek to you, here's the codebook.	2004-06-16

If The New York Times were a high school yearbook, Thomas Friedman would be \\"Most Likely To Succeed.\\" For more than two decades, he has trained his agile, disciplined mind on unraveling the palace intrigue and radical movements of Middle Eastern politics. He tells a story about a waitress in chaotic, war-torn Beirut, who politely asked if he would rather have desert now or wait until the ceasefire took effect. His point: humans can adapt to virtually anything. In this compendium of columns plus a diary of post-911 events, Friedman argues that 9/11 stemmed from U.S. failure to retaliate against prior terrorism. Here, he kicks over the log and shines his light on the origins of the religious intolerance that created 9/11. It's not a pretty sight, but you had better look. To be even modestly informed about today's issues, we maintain, you need to read this.	2004-06-16

Although it's an overused metaphor, top business speakers and best-selling author Brian Tracy show how you can apply battle-proven methods to achieving victory in the world of business. While many of the principles sound familiar, Tracy's presentation is lively and well organized. He covers the importance of having objectives, getting the facts, coordinating your activities, daring to go forward, concentrating your forces, conserving your resources and having one person in charge. He uses battlefield illustrations to remind us of these principles. He also draws on ancient and modern historical accounts of battles to illustrate the close connection between victory in war and in business. If your approach to business hinges on careful strategy and targeted planning, we think you will find tactical weapons in this military manual that you can muster in the fields of commerce.	2004-06-16

It is not really a story about two buddies who lunch together while they pursue management success - that's just the framework. It is not a book on how to implement Six Sigma - although it would prove a useful adjunct to any such program. Nor is it one of those books filled with consultant-ese whose primary function seems to be to advertise: \\"You need to hire me to help you to dispel the confusion that my book just generated.\\" This is actually a very down-to-earth introduction to the quality enhancement strategy that is continuing to transform the corporate world. Frustrated onlookers may believe that practitioners keep the practical meaning of Six Sigma hidden, like some secret magic potion, but this powerful little book blows the lid off the caldron. Written as a lunchroom dialogue between friends, it's as user-friendly as it is insightful. We highly recommend this manual to anyone at any level involved, or becoming involved, with Six Sigma.	2004-06-14

What does it take to get your customers to see the light, to praise your product like evangelists selling their creeds? How do you create customer evangelists whose word of mouth will convert other acolytes to your product? Authors Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba offer chapter and verse. They tell you how to encourage customers to preach your message for you. However, before consumers will take to the pulpit, you must have an excellent product or service that converts their thinking. There's good information here, though not much new. The last chapter sums everything up as nicely as a homily, and the appendix provides additional tips on e-mail marketing and jump-starting the evangelical process. The authors' penchant for name-coining adds little; at best it's confusing and at worst downright annoying (\\"word of mouse\\" is cute, but \\"Napsterizing\\"? \\"Customer Plus-Delta\\"?). We are is glad to see someone preaching the cause of being customer-oriented - we're already pretty faithful about that.	2004-06-14

Partha Bose has crafted an impressive volume that stands equally well as a work of interpretive history or as a contemporary guide to effective business strategy. Like any lessons-of-history-applied-to-business volume, it works to find a delicate balance between past and present. Its practical business examples range from Honda to IBM to the war in Afghanistan (a land which Alexander was the last to conquer successfully). Fortunately, Bose avoids the temptation to give the facts of history short shrift. Do not expect to find an answer about whether to do that big acquisition deal. (You'll never establish your own business empire if you get too caught up in the details!) Instead, this volume brings to life the classic lessons of leadership that march across the eons, unstoppable, unchanging, unchallenged, like the Macedonian legion itself.We  highly recommend this book to executives, strategists, history buffs and all those who harbor a secret desire to rule the world!	2004-06-14

This is a new edition of Milton Friedman's classic 1962 capitalist manifesto. As such, it was ignored, spurned and hated for decades by the intellectual, post-Keynesian establishment. In the 60s, Friedman once found himself debating a liberal who attacked him by simply reciting Friedman's views of the proper role of government. This was working rather well with the audience of college students until he quoted Friedman's opposition to the military draft. Friedman suddenly found himself awash in the unexpected cheers of students. Perhaps it was a foreshadowing of his career. Friedman won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976, and his ideas gained some degree of mainstream acceptance in the Reagan years - although many of his thoughts remain controversial. To the extent that Friedman debunks myths about the Great Depression that are widely accepted as fact, perhaps he has a point about the semi-privatization of education. We strongly recommend this volume to those who seek a deeper understanding of government's role in a free-market economy.	2004-06-14

Jeffrey Krames' biography of current U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is laced with leadership advice and built on databases and clips. This short book, at last, places Rumsfeld's long career into a coherent framework. Probably to hit a wartime deadline, Krames based the text primarily on work published about Rummy over a 40-year period, and not on independent research. In fact, a disclaimer says the book has no endorsement or authorization from Rumsfeld or anyone around him. In the 1970s, Rumsfeld published a long list of bland but entertaining aphorisms under the title, \\"Rumsfeld's Rules.\\" Krames draws many of his leadership suggestions from that compilation. But the chronology about Rumsfeld's career dominates and fascinates. Rumsfeld is far more interesting than he seems, a much more potent and historic figure. For that reason, we recommend this book to corporate officers, journalists, news junkies, political operatives, disgruntled Saudis and all defense contractors.	2004-06-14

What should you do? Write a check? Start a foundation? Joe Marconi explains that cause marketing is all this and more. In cause marketing, you identify how your company can best make a contribution while leveraging its good deeds to improve business. This makes sense: people like to buy from companies that care. But it's not as easy as it sounds. How do you choose the right partner (or do you want a partner at all) and design a program? What are the potential pitfalls? Marconi's book is a primer, complete with ample real-world examples, on the principles of cause marketing, with insight on the challenge of taking credit without appearing phony or selfish. Although it is more rhetorical than practical, we recommend this book to senior executives who want to learn about the benefits - and drawbacks - of cause marketing.	2004-06-14

When a wise old codger of rural roots warns you in humble fashion, \\"Pardon me, sir, but I dare say you're headed down the wrong road!\\" something tingling there on the back of your neck warns that you'd better listen. Even more so when the old-timer has risen beyond his oil-patch roots to become a Professor Emeritus at Princeton University. Kenneth S. Deffeyes doesn't have to impress anybody, and perhaps that's one reason he has written a book on oil that will never give you that scratchy sensation of wool being drawn over your eyes. Deffeyes returns to his Oklahoma City roots to point out, as any fellow atop a tractor or toting a pipe wrench might, that things just can't keep going up and up forever. The difference: Deffeyes has a lifetime of industry and academic experience behind him. So, how real is the coming energy shortage? Well, put it this way: We highly recommend this book only to those individuals and companies who rely on electricity or the internal combustion engine. Stone age denizens need not sign up.	2004-06-14

Customer Management of Relationships (CMR) is not a tactic or gimmick - it's a new way of looking at your business. Author Frederick Newell promises that CMR will put your customers where they should be: at the forefront of your company's efforts. Newell, an international marketing consultant and leading Customer Relationship Management (CRM) authority, explains that a strong relationship with customers is essential to success. Although his book is unnecessarily repetitive at times and poorly organized, he provides excellent advice for companies already on the road to improving their customer interactions. Valuable testimony from experts accompanies numerous case studies. Whether you took a ride on the CRM train, or not, if you want better customer relationships for your business, we think this book may be your ticket.	2004-06-14

Daniel Goleman followed up his bestselling classic Emotional Intelligence with this equally classic sequel that focuses on how emotional intelligence is applied in the workplace. Insightful and richly detailed, Goleman's work educates and inspires without ever sounding trite or sappy, like some annoying quick-fix scheme. If you are leadership bound and think success is all about strategy and technique, this will provide some very useful insights into what people really think about managing and being managed. The most intriguing sections focus on the application of emotional intelligence at work, but it would be pretty useful at home, too (if we could just get out of the office). If you think that you don't need to be more aware of the emotional undercurrents all around you, we warn that you need to read this most of all.	2004-06-14

If you've declared war on your company's lackluster performance, this book will help you launch an all-out assault. Leadership Lessons of the Navy Seals demonstrates through the experiences of this elite military unit of Sea, Air and Land commandos that combat lessons can apply to the corporate world. The book provides examples of SEAL tactics and missions, along with their corporate applications, particularly in strong team building. Authors Jeff Cannon and Lt. Cmdr. Jon Cannon combine their experience in business and the U.S. Navy in a no-nonsense, practical guide. They zero in on setting goals and commanding your troops with deadly accuracy. While their problem-solving text gets straight to the point, it isn't novel and they repeat lessons under different titles. The book is a laundry list, a useful approach in allowing you to choose what you need. We found that the Cannons fire off a good how-to book for corporate strategists who want to develop battle plans for improving their teams and organizations.	2004-06-11

If you ever wanted to belly up to the bar with a foreign correspondent, share a cold beer and swap war stories, this is your chance. Daniel Litvin, a former journalist, as well as a former corporate social responsibility (CSR) officer, shares a book full of corporate adventures from the foreign battlefields of business. In this very anecdotal examination of how the arrival of first world companies affects local societies and governments - for good or ill - in third world countries, he sews stories and history together from India to Guatemala to Iran to Manchuria to Africa. He lists the past misdeed of Aramco oil companies in Arabia, of Shell in Nigeria and of Nike's far flung contractors, seeming to say that they meant no real harm and did less harm than they were accused of doing, but he also contrasts the flawed past with the improved present. Even with responsible policies, he says, multinationals most often fail because they create unexpected dynamics and impossible expectations. We recommend this fiscal, social and corporate travelogue to executives, corporate social responsibility officers and field personnel far from home.	2004-06-11

Dave Kahle adapts many now common time management processes for the specific use of salespeople in the field. His underlying assumption is that it is much more difficult for outside salespeople to apply the usual techniques, since their lives are so filled with uncertainty. Plus salespeople tend to be action-oriented, so they don't commonly want to spend time planning or setting up systems. But, Kahle argues, such organization is critical to success in sales. While Kahle claims that most time management principles and tactics \\"totally miss the unique challenges of the field salesperson,\\" the material he covers in the book sounds very familiar. It echoes many other books about goal setting, problem solving, decision making and effective selling. We find that while this may be a helpful review of fairly common material in the guise of time management, the information is hardly unique - although its focus on salespeople's needs may give it additional value for them.	2004-06-11

Author Richard Koch contends that individual initiative is responsible for most progress, given that 20% of entrepreneurs or innovators are responsible for 80% of results and new ideas. Koch focuses on how to be a successful entrepreneur by working with a small team of supporters. He discusses the importance of good ideas, great colleagues, a powerful value proposition, good partners and, of course, ample capital. He suggests a trend toward a new breed of corporations based on individualism, though Bill Gates and Warren Buffett alone do not necessarily make a trend. While Koch writes in a breezy, engaging style, the 80/20 mantra becomes generalized and repetitious. It's a popular expression, but does it always apply? The other chapters are more solid, though they restate known entrepreneurial principles and techniques, dressed in 80/20 lingo. As such, we suggest, they may be a good introduction for the new entrepreneur, if not for the rugged individual who has already mastered the percentages.	2004-06-11

If you say po-tay-toe, and they say po-tah-toe, you say to-may-toe and they say to-mah-toe, you can work the whole thing out. Just ask Michael Watkins, Harvard associate professor and author of this solid primer on how to conduct effective negotiations. While \\"breakthrough\\" may seem like a title marketing pitch, since many of these techniques have been covered in other books, he organizes the material thoughtfully. Watkins emphasizes multi-party negotiating, examining the power of coalitions. He diagnoses the external and situational factors that shape even two-party negotiations and provides helpful examples, diagrams and lists. His clear interesting style is a big improvement over most ponderous academic tomes on negotiations. To get the most out of this volume, really read it, and then practice the techniques. Are position is clear: business managers, dispute resolution professionals and anyone facing multi-party negotiations should bring this to the table.	2004-06-11

Economist Robert Shiller became a household name when he published his previous bestseller Irrational Exuberance just as the dot.com boom was peaking. In The New Financial Order, he capitalizes on his celebrity to put forward a thoughtful, detailed proposal for managing economic risks. This highly readable book portrays a future in which many serious individual financial risks are dispersed to savvy global investors, thanks to technology. Imagine violinists being able to insure their careers in addition to their Stradivarius instruments, developing countries securing generous loans from the first world by tying the repayment schedules to their future GDPs and a revamped tax system preventing the gap between rich and poor from widening. We suggest this book to risk-management professionals who want to step back and look at the big picture, as well as to anyone who has a stake in creating new financial products to meet twenty-first century needs.	2004-06-11

Things are going swimmingly in Fish! land. In the latest volume, Fish! Tales, authors Stephen C. Lundin, John Christensen, Harry Paul and Philip Strand build on the successful training program that evolved from their first Fish book. Tales shows how four companies - a long-distance call center; a hospital neural-renal unit, a car dealership and a roofing company - have applied Fish! theories effectively. They also provide short examples from other companies to show how well the Fish! function. The four main principles are familiar by now - keep the work fun, seek to serve others, stay focused on your customers and have an enthusiastic attitude - but the examples in the book bring them alive. Along the way, the authors heavily sell their Fish! courses and merchandise - that's just good salesmanship - but the real catch of the day is the final how-to section, showing ways to apply these principles in any organization. The lively writing style helps keep you hooked. We suggest that if you haven't yet caught any Fish!, start with this one.

In Delivering Knock Your Socks Off Service, Performance Research Associates - with some editorial help from Ron Zemke - highlight the main principles and techniques involved in providing great customer service and resolving customer problems. This lively book features many short chapters, cartoons, bulleted axioms and what-to-do examples. However, much of the information seems very familiar, like a juiced-up version of hints, tips and advice that have appeared in many other customer service books. Thus, it has a kind of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu quality. While someone who is experienced in this field may find the information here too familiar, we recommend this accessible volume as a great introduction to customer service.	2004-06-11

Then you need Kerry Patterson and his co-writers, who describe techniques for effective negotiation and conflict resolution in the context of important, potentially life-changing conversations. Examples include talking yourself into a promotion, bringing up important information at meetings and working out problems with your spouse. Some tips will sound familiar, such as knowing what you really want and being open to alternatives. However, the book also highlights some themes that are often forgotten in negotiations, such as making it safe for others to express their true feelings and desires. The authors explain how to avoid getting forced into false either-or choices and tell you how to remain alert for unstated alternatives or possibilities. This lively book includes many examples drawn from business and personal relationships. We recommend it in particular to those are new to negotiations and conflict resolution, though it teaches solid skills that any manager - or any marriage partner, for that matter - could benefit from mastering.	2004-06-11

You're back in the fishing boat with the crew that brought you the successful Fish! and Fish! Tales. Offering another finny fable, Stephen C. Lundin, John Christensen and Harry Paul present a business parable based on creating and sustaining successful change. The book uses the same fictitious approach as the other two Fish!ing trips, but this time the story is set at a hospital's nursing station. The agent-of-change head nurse has departed and the new head nurse feels that the group is losing its vision. Then, she discovers that a local sushi restaurant is a model of excellence, and all goes swimmingly after that. Although the advice offered isn't particularly unique, some may find a certain charm in the story. Given that this is round three, the format may seem a little repetitive to those who have already Fish!ed. If you want to catch the core of the message on your first cast, look for the highlights on the occasional pages in whale-size type. We recommend the basic common sense of these messages, even if the storytelling is a little fishy.	2004-06-11

McGraw, Ph.D., better known to Oprah Winfrey fans as Dr. Phil, has popped out a refreshingly in-your-face contribution to the self-help genre that doesn't beat around the bush. You will not be asked to commune with your inner child or vent your anger and pain. Instead, Life Strategies is a prescription for action, complete with stories, including about Oprah. Each chapter contains at least one writing assignment, designed to stimulate honest inquiry and to challenge even your most basic assumptions. These culminate in a meticulously detailed set of instructions for creating your life strategy. Organized self-starters will love the lists and matrices, but even readers who don't plunge into the assignments will gain fresh insights into their behavior. We prescribe this bouncy book to anyone seeking a step-by-step plan for self-assessment and realistic life change. Cynics need not apply.	2004-06-11

Planning a corporate party or special event? Don't lift a finger until you've read The Business of Event Planning. In this highly practical book, author Judy Allen covers every aspect of the process in exhaustive detail. Allen, an author, writer and experienced event planner, contends that events are more than just feel-good activities. Events, she says, must be staged as strategic tools with return-on-investment potential. If you want to know how, she covers all the basics. Even though the book is geared toward large events, the principles can be applied to functions of any size. Allen includes details of proposal writing, itineraries, contract negotiations, fee setting, high tech applications and security concerns in a post-September-11 world. We recommend this logistical guide to corporate staffers or event planners who want to master the fine details.	2004-06-11

Author Gerald Kraines addresses a neglected area of management and lays out practical, important prescriptions for turning accountability into a linchpin of a thriving organization. Unfortunately, his solid counsel reads like an especially turgid graduate-level textbook. While all the ideas in this book are useful and many are extremely valuable, they're obscured by the heavy use of jargon (much of it self-defined, so the book often seems to be written in its own unique language). As a result, even though it is only some 220 pages, readers may give up, defeated by stretches of nearly impenetrable text. Kraines, who builds on the work of Elliott Jaques, tries to open doors with accessible case studies, but he soon lapses back into his specialized vocabulary. As a result, we believe the full text will interest mainly a very specific audience: business students and professors, theorists, consultants and high-level managers at large organizations may want to look up particular chapters for details and context. Even if you don't have the stamina for the whole tome, hang in there for the gems.	2004-06-11

A sentence crafter happily at work, James O'Loughlin imparts clarity with literacy. On the rare occasion that his industrious research does not find just the right quote from Buffett or Munger (chapters average 90 footnotes), he uses their favorite metaphors from sports and life. This is excellent writing that falls short only on prophesy and damnation. Buffett must pass Berkshire on to an heir in the next decade, but exactly who might follow him is given short shrift. How this unknown magician might cope with Munger (too old to be an heir) is avoided carefully. The manuscript was begun before September 11, 2001, created insurance chaos, but O'Loughlin doesn't elaborate upon it, beyond suggesting that chaos benefits Buffett - whose main float derives from super catastrophic insurance and reinsurance. We recommend this volume highly - along with getting to know the Real Buffett, you will learn a tidy amount about economics.	2004-06-11

Roger Bean and Russell Radford examine the history of innovation for ways that your organization can innovate continually. They ask why companies successfully innovate for a while and then lose steam. Their answer is a new organization-wide system that prioritizes innovation, management and strategy. This fairly academic structure - more like a proposal than a working process - encourages building systemic promotion of continual innovation by creating an environment that values, nurtures and encourages it, cascading from the executive to the managerial to the operational team level. However, toward the end of the book, the authors refer to using a Balanced Scorecard for assessing performance from a total quality perspective. That approach bypasses the inspirational, charismatic form of innovation and cuts right to the process, like an accountant or an engineer's model of innovation. Thus, if you are process-savvy but hesitant about new ideas, we suggest that this might just be the innovation book for you: lots of system, not much flash.	2004-06-11

If you've wondered what's behind Southwest Airlines' uncommon success, wonder no more. Author Jody Hoffer Gittell lays it all out in The Southwest Airlines Way. Gittel, a university professor, explains that at Southwest Airlines, relationship building and collaboration aren't just given lip service - they're a condition of employment. This is an excellent case study of the airline and its competitors, wherein Gittell reveals the characteristics that make Southwest shine, traits other airlines have tried hard to emulate. She makes a compelling case for the power of relationships inside, outside and at all levels of the corporate hierarchy. Meticulously researched and offering abundant industry testimonials, this corporate exploration doesn't feel like yet another marketing book. We think this excellent exposition is just the ticket for corporate leaders who want to know not just how Southwest did it, but how they can do it too.	2004-06-11

A book that has been continuously in print for nearly 70 years obviously has timeless relevance. The principles of value investing, spelled out for the first time in Security Analysis by Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd, have made fortunes for investors since it was first published in 1934. For example, Warren Buffett calls this book his Bible. Much has changed on Wall Street since the 1930s, but the concept of buying undervalued companies has not. In addition to its lucid explanation of investment basics, the book is a fascinating picture of a time when the lessons of the Great Depression were still being absorbed. The Securities Act of 1933 had just changed the rules of financial disclosure, and most public companies were manufacturers, mines, railroads or utilities - not the makeup of today's blue-chip portfolio. We recommend this book to serious investors who want to cut through modern Wall Street jargon, and to students of financial history.	2004-06-09

Warren Bennis and Patricia Ward Biederman describe the qualities that generate \\"Great Groups,\\" capable of meaningful creative collaborations. Despite the myth of individual achievement and heroic leadership, the authors delve into major breakthroughs accomplished by group effort. Often Great Groups unite around the vision of a charismatic leader and work toward that leader's goal with obsessive commitment. Bennis and Biederman spend much of the book describing the workings of a half dozen such groups - from the Manhattan project to the founders of the Disney Studio to Bill Clinton's campaign team. These case histories read like individual short stories, but they each tell the saga of a driven creative collaboration. The authors conclude with lessons you can apply to bring the dedication of Great Groups to bear within your organization. We recommend this clearly written, logically organized book to leaders and collaborators in any industry, with two caveats. First, acquiring the requisite charisma is up to you. And, second, as to the authors' fulsome praise of obsessive work habits, well, that's so `90s.	2004-06-09

Peters should be respected as a writer and thinker willing to journey across perilous ground. He has spent most of his life and career writing and teaching about the three great Middle Eastern religions: Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Trying to be objective about three religions that often have been locked in mortal rivalry is hardly a safe route to the destination of political correctness. Perhaps the most valuable thing about Peters' book is that it is essentially non-polemical: it does not appear to reflect any particular religious point of view. Certainly, it is very well researched. Peters sheds a wealth of light on conflicts that are central to the events unfolding on the world stage, although he focuses more on historical development than on contemporary issues. While the degree to which objective analysis can accurately or successfully explain the conflicting passions of contrasting religious faiths remains questionable, Peters deserves credit for this impressive achievement. In part due to the critical nature of the issues that he addresses, we give his work a high recommendation.	2004-06-09

During the collapse of the so-called Internet bubble, the legendary Dutch fiscal intoxication with tulips, called tulipmania, was widely cited as a lesson from history. The financial press hyped stories of deluded Dutch farmers who mortgaged all their worldly possessions to purchase a single prize tulip bulb, only to meet financial ruin when the bubble inevitably burst. Economist Peter M. Garber dug into history, and found that most of the common wisdom about the tulipmania was false. So, if you ever wondered how Dutch investors could have been so foolish, there is a simple answer: they weren't. Famous First Bubbles clearly evolved from a series of academic papers but, nonetheless, the book is entertaining. The primary focus on the tulip bubble makes the sections on the Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles seem like afterthoughts. We recommend this to iconoclasts who enjoy debunking historical legends and to bubble watchers everywhere.	2004-06-09

This is a comprehensive guide to identifying and developing future leaders. The authors present an exhaustive (sometimes exhausting) explanation of a program called \\"Acceleration Pooling\\" - a fancy collective name for grouping everyone in your firm who has the potential to lead. Much of the content seems like common sense, yet, organizations harried by short-term challenges can easily neglect long-term tasks, such as leadership development. This carefully planned, meticulously documented approach may keep organizations from neglecting the future. Despite its turgid, jargon-choked style, this book may fill the need. Time-pressed managers can glean the most important points quickly from chapters 2, 6 and 16, which have some solid gold principles of succession planning. Human Resource managers will want to delve into the other chapters. The authors, who are consultants, make a strong case for hiring consultants to implement this system, and have registered, copyrighted, service marked and/or trademarked every form and bit of terminology that could possibly be protected. We  note that many of these leadership building methods, tools and techniques are in the public domain, in case you want to do-it-yourself, using this guide book.	2004-06-09

In Sales Don't Just Happen, Stephan Schiffman, the founder of a fast-growing sales training company, expands on his approach to selling based on developing a proposal that makes sense to the prospect. He fills his book with discussions of the same basic principles he has presented in several other books, though each has its own emphasis, such as cold calling or making a more effective close. Here Schiffman ranges through the four key phases of the sales cycle - prospecting, interviewing, presentation and close - to teach 26 strategies (one main technique per chapter) that push a sale forward. At the end of each chapter, he summarizes how to apply that chapter's tips. These methods are generally quite useful, though familiar, basic approaches. One warning: if you've read Schiffman's other sales books, you may experience a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. But otherwise, we recommend this solid manual to any corporate sales rep who makes in-person presentations in quest of large sales.	2004-06-09

Perhaps the greatest tribute to the work of author Roy Jenkins is that, at times, he seemed to know what Winston Churchill was actually thinking - and you're pretty sure he's right. When the mind you're reading about belongs to perhaps the greatest Prime Minister in the history of Great Britain, Nobel-prize winner Winston Churchill, that is a pretty impressive accomplishment. Jenkins' biography is essentially unsentimental, and reveals Churchill's idiosyncrasies and errors in an honest manner that serves only to elevate, rather than tarnish, the legacy of the man who rallied the free world to resist the tyranny of National Socialism. Jenkins has written an extraordinary volume which we highly recommends to any student of history.	2004-06-09

Bechet provides a comprehensive guide to planning your staffing. He includes a CD with PowerPoint slide presentations, adaptable Excel spreadsheets, and assessment and evaluation forms. The book has ample examples and case studies of how to set up staffing, and tons of charts, graphs and formulas. But, you cannot apply his models and practices without this detailed hands-on workbook of his scorecard strategy, where you enter relevant data in a matrix that provides staffing direction. Warning: if your basic assumptions are wrong or if your situation changes quickly, you could take a wrong turn, so proceed carefully. While this is not a fun read - in fact, it can seem convoluted - Bechet's intent is practicality, not recreation. This is a hardcore resource for hiring decision-makers. So we suggest that you pour yourself a stiff cup of coffee, grab a thick notepad and muscle up to the staffing task with serious, strategic intent.	2004-06-09

Author Adam Morgan went hunting for the second most successful brands. He sought commonalities among them to develop guidelines for those who are challenging the number one brands in their fields. In other words, if you are coming into the battle in the number two slot, here's your strategy for winning the marketing wars. Morgan is very adept at breaking things down into precise action steps. Witty and engaging, he offers a detailed analysis of the current consumer attitude about brands plus strategies you can use to market your second or third rank brand. We recommend this compilation of competitive ideas to those who want to boost their \\"Challenger\\" brands.	2004-06-09

Stephan Schiffman, who has trained more than 450,000 salespeople, expands upon an approach he used in an earlier book about crafting sales proposals that make sense to your prospects. He stresses the need to listen so you can respond to the customer's needs, rather than just trying to convince the prospect to buy. Some of this book may give you a sense of deja vu if you've read any of his previous sales books, such as Power Sales Presentations. Otherwise, this is a fairly solid, sensible, no gimmicks approach to sales. Schiffman includes effective hands-on examples of sales approaches, including cold calling scripts and an appendix of sample dialogues. He teaches selling methods to use in different corporate settings, such as presenting to committees. We find the book's 30 short snappy chapters ideal for reading in concise, instructive bites, just right for busy sales people.	2004-06-09

George Eckes has written a concise, thorough introduction to the theory and practice of Six Sigma, the management philosophy that Jack Welch called the most important initiative of his entire career at General Electric. The book provides a look at every aspect of Six Sigma. In some places, it seems a bit too detailed for so short a book - particularly when the author introduces the variety of statistical charts, graphs and tables used in the analysis phase of Six Sigma. But that is a quibble. Eckes also gets a bit self-serving when, in the question and answer chapter, he takes a swipe at consultants who agree to work on a contingency basis, for a percentage of the savings a client achieves, instead of for a fee. In fact, we, where we are always glad to avoid a squabble, note that managers who use this book may achieve some level of business improvement without hiring any consultants at all.	2004-06-09

To boost your sales group's performance, give your salespeople very specific assessments and instructions, as per authors Andris A. Zoltners, Prabhakant Sinha and Greggor A. Zoltners. The trouble here is that the instructions are not only detailed, they are highly technical. You have to see sales as a science to make the best use of the graphs, charts, lists, diagrams and formulas. If you can make your way through the academic writing, you'll find some useful hard data, such as statistical evidence that backs the need for precise sales performance assessments. Despite its lengthy retelling of some very basic sales principles, we recommend this manual to the audience its authors suggest, \\"sales managers, top managers, salespeople who want to advance professionally, divisional presidents and business owners\\" plus business school students. If you're going to be academic, you might as well learn something.	2004-06-09

In Just for Fun, Linus Torvalds, the Finnish creator of the Linux operating system, mixes his personal story, told in both narrative and e-mail dispatches, with the saga of his development of the Linux operating system. Torvalds' personal account makes the book fascinating. He began as a self-proclaimed nerd (and even a jerk) who labored to create an operating system in his garage and eventually became the head of the world's largest open source project. By requiring buyers and licensees to keep the Linux source code open, Torvalds assures the continued technological evolution of his system. The episodic nature of the book makes it choppy, the technical descriptions are hard for the uninitiated to track and co-writer David Diamond's digressions are revealing about Torvalds' personal life, but a little disruptive. Even so, we recommend this entertaining, interesting book that may even lead you to consider using Linux on your computer, whether or not you are another self-proclaimed computer nerd.	2004-06-09

As an Army Ranger, Dean Hohl endured Ranger School, in which he was forced to figure out how to survive 14 days in the woods with only 14 meals. He later parachuted into Panama during the U.S. invasion. Now a consultant who leads corporate types through Ranger-style boot camps, Hohl and co-author Maryann Karinch make a convincing case that business leaders can benefit from the same type of training Rangers are given. Organizations need leaders who are flexible and communicative, he argues in an engaging and illustrative way. Hohl resists the temptation to dwell too much on his own war stories, although at times he'd do well to rely more on his experiences and less on bloodless summaries of corporate problems seemingly parroted from the business press. We recommend this book to any manager who leads or works with a team. If you wish that your team could act like a Ranger platoon, start reading.	2004-06-08

Monica Langley follows Sandford Weill, a shy Jewish boy from Brooklyn, through his youthful struggles against adversity, his journey to the absolute top of the financial world and his tainted success. Seen through the prism of Weill's tumultuous career, the financial world is small, despite its importance, internally more like a village than a city. The book just confirms your suspicions that practical finance bears almost no resemblance to what you learned in economics class. We recommended Langley for skillfully molding the saga of this titanic financier's career into such a compelling, well-constructed narrative.	2004-06-08

Aswath Damodaran backs up his explanations of investing philosophies with ample studies, detailed graphics and a website, even if you need to absorb the dense, detailed data in 15 minute chunks. This well-researched, solid book will be useful to individual investors, investment managers and anyone who wonders why various investment philosophies succeed and how (and at what risk) portfolio gains are made. The index investing chapter and the final summary are required reading for investors wondering how huge portfolios crashed after U.S. equities collapsed. We recommend this soup-to-nuts introduction to sophisticated investing. Your financial security could hinge on a good grasp of the issues it covers.	2004-06-08

This book is worth reading, given that the Carlyle Group employs important former politicians (such as the first President Bush) and deals with politically sensitive companies. This history of the mammoth private equity firm with its fingers in many government pies reminds you that the right relationships and the right schools can compensate for professional ineptitude. And, if a fraction of author Dan Briody's implications about it are true, democracy is in serious trouble. But is even a fraction true? This clumsy compilation leaves you wondering. More original reporting and less exaggeration and bias would have helped Briody prove his conspiracy theories. Unfortunately, he does not display the requisite expertise about finance, law, politics or the arms trade. Indeed, given the innuendoes he delivers in breathless, clich&eacute;d prose, you could ask if the book just might include a stretcher or two. It is a suggestive stage whisper from outside the political theater's back door. We say you'll find this novelistic report intriguing, if you take it with a grain of salt.	2004-06-08

This book is one of the few thorough, detailed, systematic guides to team leadership in the context of Six Sigma. Those assigned to lead or participate in Six Sigma teams will find it hands-on practical and consistently useful. To use this specific approach to team management, you need to be familiar with the Six Sigma concept and process already. Then, this straightforward, explanatory manual will take you step by step, list by list, through the task of facilitating a successful team, from establishing a plan to dealing with problem personalities. It isn't exactly juicy reading, except for the lively illustrative anecdotes, and the grammar is occasionally awkward given the jargon involved, but this focused package of instructions will help you get the job done effectively and efficiently. We recommend it enthusiastically to managers who are embarking upon, or already involved in, a Six Sigma team management process.	2004-06-08

This lengthy philosophical treatise from the editor-in-chief of The Economist wanders all over recent history and offers some cautious, well-hedged ruminations about the shape of things to come. It's a pleasure to read, like lounging in a posh boat and drifting down a slow river of thought. The current of thought is almost directionless. Emmott shifts from subject to subject, time period to time period, perspective to perspective easily, with no restraint. He has a little pro-Americanism here, a little underestimating of the Chinese there, but nothing sharp-edged. Readers looking for a succinct point of view will be disappointed; so will those seeking fresh, new ideas. But we understand that those who enjoy considering and decoding the complex web of political and economic forces will be delighted.	2004-06-08

Stephan Schiffman, the famous master of cold calls and sales techniques, provides bite-sized tips on correcting common sales problems. He uses the same nuggets-of-advice format as in many of his other books, such as The Most Common Sales Habits of Highly Successful Salespeople, and the formula is a winner for him. His advice may sound fairly familiar, and much of it echoes his other books, though the concept that you can error-proof your sales approach is a dandy new angle. The advice is sound and is soundly given. Schiffman presents a short, brisk directory of 25 goofs to avoid and ways to fix up your sales approach in this easy-to-read booster. Maybe the simplicity and accessibility of his step by step approach explains why titles based on 10 of this or 25 of that are so popular - just as we suspect this spiffy countdown will be as well.	2004-06-08

Investing Under Fire is a very interesting collection of essays by 30 luminaries from various fields, some of them not at all related to investing. Each selection contains at least a thought or two to repay the effort of perusal, and that's a great deal more than many books deliver, especially books about investing. The anthology's five segments cover mutual funds, key sectors - from Asia to precious metals, research and legal resources, innovative companies and geopolitical influences. Anyone who merely reads the first selection, by Vanguard founder John Bogle, and applies its lessons, would more than recapture the purchase price of the book. Despite the sometimes self-promotional comments from a few of the other contributors, it's a very valuable book. If nothing else, we note, it will expose you to a spectrum of diverse opinions, a useful prophylactic against complacency.	2004-06-08

Peter Burrows offers insights into high level business, where personality matters more than economics, as he explores the mammoth HP-Compaq merger. Most mergers fail to make money or to produce the promised \\"synergies\\" so, he asks, why - other than ego - do CEOs pursue them? Though stylistically somewhat trite, this book successfully explores the HP Board's decision to approve the merger, with Walter B. Hewlett's vote in favor, and his subsequent lonely, ultimately quixotic battle against it. The most contentious issues in contemporary business are all here: shareholder rights and value vs. CEO power; employee-oriented cultures vs. \\"re-engineering;\\" corporate integrity vs. sharp practice; and the interesting spectacle of a ruthless, hard-headed female CEO pitted against a sensitive, cello-playing man. The author says Hewlett-Packard executives were told not to speak with him after he quoted merger critics in Business Week, so there is an inevitable Walter Hewlett bias. We found this to be a very good read, even a must read, for corporate warriors.	2004-06-08

The good news is, Richard Florida's book recognizes the growing economic and sociological impact of creativity. The bad news is that in just two years, it has lost some of its gloss. The collapse of the bull market, the popping of the dot.com bubble, the 9/11 trauma, each took some shine off of the creative economy, with its casual dress days, flexible schedules and free rides. But even though this appraisal occasionally sounds quaint, we believe that the book's faith in the transforming economic and social power of creativity, its broad view, and its excellent references and quotations make it worth recommending.	2004-06-08

This book offers a passionate and stupendously irreverent slap in the face to virtually every management orthodoxy and business shibboleth. Nothing escapes the scathing criticism of this corporate Jeremiad. Managing for shareholder value? Woe to you, sinner! Think the brand is important? Out with you, infidel! There's plenty to find fault with in author Benjamin Hurt's presentation of his case. He's vengefully biased, and never lets a silly fixation like \\"balance\\" get in the way of a good zinger. He's set himself to dig holes in the dikes that hold the wild waters of skepticism at bay. This book will make you mad, make you protest, may even make you throw it against the wall in disgust. But any book that makes you react that way has something going for it. At least, it's a bracingly different perspective from anything else you'll read about management, marketing or finance. With that caveat about balance firmly in mind,<br />We suggest reading this decidedly eccentric, provocative original, if you dare to take the risk.	2004-06-08

Amid the slew of personal finance books on the market, Suze Orman's unique approach stands out. Although she has more than 20 years of financial experience and expertise, her books don't merely dispense advice from on high. Her monetary rules may be universal and timeless, but she describes them with the sympathetic voice of a best friend. Written in the aftermath of the collapse of the Internet bubble, her latest advice book aims to comfort shell-shocked investors who are facing huge losses. Orman's primary tactic is to remind readers that money is a means to an end, not an end in itself, and that decisions about money take place in a larger personal and spiritual context. To that end, a helpful workbook is included. We recommend this book to anyone who is wary of making financial decisions in today's unsettling market environment, as well as to those looking to sort out their financial priorities.	2004-06-08

Chances are you're selling to the wrong people. In this A-to-Z primer, Anthony Parinello explains how to get your foot in the executive suite. To be successful in sales, he says, go right to the top. Although well organized, the content at times reads like a stream-of-consciousness speech. Many of the \\"secrets\\" Parinello reveals are plain common sense - it's hard to believe that anybody in sales wouldn't know them. His advice about using the Web for research is dated (when was the last time anybody used the term \\"information superhighway\\"?), but the principles he outlines are timeless and make this a great read which we recommend to performance-oriented sales people and sales managers. Overall, this inspirational, motivational account should fire up sales people and help them see the forest, not just the trees.	2004-06-08

This book is a bit unfocused, but even its tangents are interesting. You get a few pages here on Chinese history, a few pages there of polemic about rich nations' unfair trading practices, here a digression, there a ramble. It's not completely about China and it's not completely about the WTO, though those bases are covered, and the other subjects it touches upon - including Asian regional economics - add to its value. The authors put both sides of the debate over trade in reasonably fair focus. We confirm that what they say about China, while not new, merits mulling over by anyone affected by globalization.	2004-06-08

Roger Dawson, a top speaker and writer on negotiation and persuasion, has written, in fact, a very persuasive book. Solid research that identifies effective sales strategies and explains why they work sets Dawson's book apart from many other volumes on sales techniques - even when his advice is repetitive. He warns you away from manipulation, though he doesn't hesitate to use some forms of it, along with psychological insight, time pressure, friendship, subliminal messages and outright emotion to persuade clients to buy. Dawson writes in an easy-to-read, breezy, yet authoritative style and includes tricks, techniques, clever anecdotes and chapter summaries. The book is as well organized as a speech in which Dawson tells you what he is going to say, says it and then tells you what he just said. We recommend this book to people who want to sell better, and who have the starch to use intense powers of persuasion.	2004-06-08

From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog may sound like a mystifying title, but this book provides a reasonable overview of the history of the software industry. At times, given the ups and downs in the industry, it can't avoid sounding like a catalog of defunct firms and obsolete software. However, this chronology is quite useful for anyone who wants to come up to speed very quickly and very generally on the main trends in the industry. Author Martin Campbell-Kelly covers some of the industry's seminal events and the main categories of software. Vexingly or refreshingly, he takes pains to say as little about Microsoft as possible, making it clear that others have written enough on that subject. So, with that absence duly noted, we recommend this book to those who want an inside history of the software industry, from massive mainframes to little blue cartoon porcupines.	2004-06-08

Identity theft is an inevitable but horrifying form of abuse in a society that depends largely on trust, credibility and the free flow of information. Victims often don't even know they're being taken advantage of until their accounts are drained and their credit is ruined. Sometimes, they don't know until the police break down their door, arrest them at gunpoint and throw them into jail for crimes identity thieves have committed in their names. This book will tell most readers more than they probably want to know about the crime of identity theft, with anecdote after anecdote about repugnantly clever thieves. It's not particularly well written and lifts too much from public documents and testimony, but this isn't the kind of book one reads for pleasure. This concise, very useful guide to self-protection points out many sources for additional information and action. We highly recommend it for the purpose of minimizing your risk. After all, you want to protect the answer to that eternal question of identity, \\"Who am I?,\\" from the thief who claims, \\"I am you.\\"	2004-06-08

Erica Orloff and Kathy Levinson pair up to deliver a jam-packed, step-by-step, practical guide on how to \\"have it all.\\" You can conduct a fulfilling career and have a personal life at the same time, if you work at home. Today, with the majority of America working from home in some capacity or another, this book is a must-have on almost every bookshelf. In their hysterically funny way, the authors bring to light any snare you can imagine (and some you'd never think of!) while starting a home business or venturing into the world of telecommuting. And if they make it sound just a little too breezy, you'll find that out as you proceed. So whether you're just toying with the idea of reducing your commute time to less than 60 seconds or your business has already taken over your home, we recommend picking up this quick read and spending some time with two funny ladies who know first hand how to make a home-based business work.	2004-06-07

The first edition of Bernard Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street appeared in 1973, a few years after the twentieth century's first big computer technology bubble, the go-go era, popped. This, the newest and eighth edition, appears after the popping of the dot.com bubble, the last of the twentieth century's great computer technology bubbles. Investors burned in the first bubble could have been excused; after all, they didn't have Malkiel's book. But it's astounding how avidly Internet speculators threw aside all that Malkiel and others had taught them. This book belongs on every investor's bookshelf, and ought to be consulted, or at least touched to the forehead, before any investment decision. Most investment books aren't trustworthy, because their authors are salespeople who are really making a pitch instead of trying to inform you. Malkiel is disinterested. He is a teacher with the intellectual discipline of a true financial economist, and yet he writes as vividly as a good journalist. We recommend this classic: all you need to know about the market is between its covers.	2004-06-07

Mary Kay, Inc., is perhaps best known for two things: the cult of personality surrounding its founder, Mary Kay Ash, and the fact that it rewards successful salespeople with pink Cadillacs. In this illuminating book, management expert Jim Underwood delves into the guiding principles of Mary Kay, Inc.'s daily operations, which remain, 40 years later, true to Ash's founding vision. Countries or corporations founded by a charismatic leader often sag or sink when that leader inevitably steps down. Mary Kay's leadership was unique in that she built a solid foundation for the company so it could continue without her day-to-day guidance. This corporate biography represents the first time the privately owned company allowed an outsider complete access to its managers and employees, enabling Underwood to persuasively illustrate nine leadership rules with testimonies from members of the \\"Mary Kay family.\\" We recommend this to anyone who aspires to leadership. Mary Kay may look fluffy, but it's all about the firm.	2004-06-07

The Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year (EOY) Awards identify the best entrepreneurs, and author Gregory K. Ericksen runs the awards program. This gives him unusual insight into the judging criteria and the winners' performance standards.

He shares advice and experience from judges (former EOY winners) and current winners. Profiles of the judges and longer examinations of winning companies - including Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Southwest Airlines and 1-800-Flowers - offer practical case histories of entrepreneurs who have done it all, from starting out in garages to surviving disasters to succeeding in pacesetting businesses. Despite his cheerleading tone, Ericksen gets down in the trenches of entrepreneurship. We recommend his inside look at its triumphs and travails to owners and managers of businesses large and small. (Editor's note: getAbstract provided some consulting services to Ernst &amp; Young during the preparation of this book.)	2004-06-07

Robert Miles knows Warren Buffett, and it's clear that he also knows a thing or two about the people who run the companies in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Armed with information gleaned from eight months of intensive interviews, Miles uncovers what makes a Berkshire manager tick, and covers the workings of Berkshire, itself, as well. Writing through the voices of the CEOs he portrays, Miles skillfully weaves the colorful histories of 18 firms into a revealing set of success stories. Many tales are similar - the CEOs love their companies; they worked hard to build solid businesses and no one regrets selling his firm to Berkshire. They all sound genuinely happier than you might possibly believe, and each chapter has business models you shouldn't miss. We invite any executive  to enter these pages for an insider's view (still, it doesn't hurt to remember, they all knew Warren was gonna read it).	2004-06-07

Hernando de Soto's ideas cannot and should not be ignored. This book will open many eyes to the nature of capital. The author suggests a radically simple yet enormously challenging way of bringing the world's impoverished billions onto the track of capitalism and development: give them legal property rights to what they \\"own.\\" The author's intriguing case is that a lack of property rights - not a lack of entrepreneurial zeal or competence - stymies development in the former East Bloc and Third World countries. This seemed to be a shockingly original notion when the author first propounded it in his bestseller The Other Patch, and it still does. If the book has a flaw, we warn, it is that the author's undisguised missionary ardor sometimes makes one wonder whether he is merely a zealot. Even if he were one, the book would merit reading.	2004-06-07

Ken Blanchard of One-Minute Manager fame draws on the positive training techniques that SeaWorld whale trainers use to get their whales to want to perform. Although using whale training as a teaching model is a unique twist on the literature about training and motivating employees, the material itself is not nearly as exotic. Much of it draws upon traditional principles for getting along with others, such as building trust, emphasizing the positive and redirecting undesired actions into more productive channels. If you've read Blanchard's previous book about being aware when people do something right so you can praise them, some of this content will seem familiar, though he says this is his \\"most important\\" book. The story line tracks mythical businessman Wes Kingley's discussions with whale trainers who reveal what they do to train their creatures, gradually, carefully and with real warmth. These conversations blow some very basic points up to whale-size, but Blanchard writes with charm. We recommend this splashy manual, the first course in Whale Psyc 101.	2004-06-07

Nobel Prize-winning economic scientist Amartya Sen attempts to popularize a series of lectures he presented to executives at the World Bank in 1996. He challenges traditional economic theories to justify a more aggressive, humane and generous funding formula to benefit the world's poorest nations. This goal is based on his theory about individual capabilities and functionings, and how they affect opportunity, both person by person and in a society. Even though this is aimed for general discussion rather than Ph.D. course work, it is an extremely daunting book to read, a mental maze land mined with quirky thoughts and a thick lexicon only an academic could love. More thesis than not, the text is 298 pages plus 60 pages of small type footnotes. The short version: the rich get richer and the poor remain deprived of abilities and awaiting enlightened development. We recommend this dense, challenging but, as they say, important book to insomniacs, liberal world bankers, economic policy makers, the Kofi Annan fan club and students of economic science.	2004-06-07

A special note in the preface of this book explains that it went to press just as the Enron story was beginning to break. Three of its chapters provide almost all the information anyone would have needed to spot the problems at Enron, not to mention at the other big corporations whose scandals made recent headlines. Spotting fraud isn't that hard. The authors provide a very useful toolkit that even a novice investor can use. Some of their coverage of the regulatory apparatus will no doubt have to be changed in future editions, as the regulations themselves keep changing, but this enlightening introduction to the nitty-gritty of skeptical financial statement analysis will have enduring utility. It's written by accountants, so it gets a bit plodding in spots, but their anecdotes relieve the tedium and their information is invaluable. We recommend this reality check for every investor's bookshelf, as well as every employee's and every financial reporter's. Anyone who depends on corporate performance or who uses corporate financial statements should read it.	2004-06-07

Dinesh D'Souza has produced earlier incisive, groundbreaking books. Illiberal Education and The End of Racism are both thought-provoking reads for conservatives and liberals alike, but this is one has an additional purpose: a comprehensive outline of conservative doctrine and a blanket condemnation of the opposing points of view. D'Souza revisits some previously published opinions, and if he doesn't always support them with fact, he does bring heartfelt argument to the fore. He also refers back to his other two books when illumination is needed. The book, as the title suggests, is formatted as a series of letters to a college student, complete with fond recollections of the author's days as a conservative firebrand at Dartmouth. Even constrained by this gimmick, D'Souza is an entertaining writer who delights in, \\"harpooning liberals,\\" eloquently if with slight regard for fairness. We recommend this book as an ideological dessert for potential conservatives, more than as a soup-to-nuts guide to conservatism - and its no-shades-of-gray approach may even help liberals prepare their counterarguments.	2004-06-07

White provide practical instructions for dealing with change, as all leaders must. Rather than assuming that only certain personality types and traits are suitable for leadership in changing times, they addresses the behavior patterns that mark a successful leader. The authors place their behavioral concepts in a familiar context with case histories. The true value of their book lies in specific exercises that will enhance your ambiguity-coping skills. Some level-headed readers may be slightly put off by the seeming wackiness of some of these notions (they range from \\"spend some time around children\\" to \\"analyze how you spend your time\\") and the light-hearted tone (they do refer to Star Trek). Lighthearted or not, the advice in this book may just save your job - or your company's future. We recommend this book to senior executives, regardless of industry, as well as to anyone who is concerned about the fast pace of change and wants some help keeping up.	2004-06-07

This is a very lucid, practical introduction to the principles of value investing. It is detached, relatively objective considering the authors' bias in favor of the subject, doesn't hype or hard-sell and, on the whole, would be a valuable addition to any investor's bookshelf. If you're a relative beginner, your shelf will also need to include a dictionary of financial terms - the authors assume you already know the vocabulary. And who is the Graham cited in the title? He is Benjamin Graham, who all but invented security analysis. With coauthor David Dodd, he produced the book Security Analysis in 1934. Later, Graham wrote The Intelligent Investor. Both books are investment classics and have been revised and re-issued. This one may endure, as well, based on its thorough exposition on how to value a company and its instructive profiles of value investing heavyweights. Our recommendation: strong buy, long term hold.	2004-06-07

Despite its title, this book doesn't say much, or much of substance, about business today. Instead, it concentrates on lively professional and personal profiles of eight twentieth century management theorists of varying impact. Hammer and Champy, who launched the 1990s re-engineering movement, are mentioned only in the conclusion, and the gurus behind managing for shareholder value aren't mentioned. A little less detail about peccadilloes of the long dead and a little more about crucial management ideas that have shaped contemporary business might have made the book more relevant. Interestingly, it indicates that slave owners anticipated some of the progressive ideas in modern management but the author leaves it to the readers to make the connection: voila, contemporary workers believe the cant of empowerment about as much as the slaves believed the plantation master's pieties. We recommend this book for its anecdotal, gossipy entertainment value. It will make you cautious about management consultants - but if you aren't already, you can't have spent much time in business.	2004-06-07

This book is relevant to all those who suspect \\"WWW\\" stands for \\"World Wide Wait.\\" If you don't understand the Internet's shortcomings, just type \\"antidisestablishmentarianism\\" into the Google search engine and try to make sense of the 5,890 returns you get. Currently, there are three billion pages of information on the Internet, but within the next year that number will double. The question is how to manage the data while still increasing the functionality of the Web, continuing its transformation from a place where you \\"find something\\" to a place where you \\"do something.\\" To accomplish those tasks, you have to go beyond \\"meta-tags\\" - those invisible headlines that tell search engines what any given page is really all about. This volume outlines the Semantic Web approach, which offers answers to those questions. A word of warning: this somewhat technical book will be of greatest interest to programmers, Web designers, specialists and motivated visionaries. We recommend it highly - if you fit into one of those categories.	2004-06-07

This impressively researched opus reflects an obsession with One Big Idea that never comes quite clearly into focus, but revolves around the critical historical role played by national credit. Behold an author who not only quotes the Biblical book of Numbers, but also interprets it as a document of financial history, ignoring the contentious issues of authorship and anachronism that make scriptural exegesis such challenging work for specialists. He traces the way government and conflict are funded from Herodotus to the Hanoverian Court to Woodrow Wilson. Like the River Platte, this work is a mile wide and an inch deep; but the river has a definite direction, and this meanders. If you fancy an intriguing browse through major and minor points of political and fiscal history, we have found just the book for you. Some scenes are indelible, like the Germans celebrating WWI bond purchases by driving iron nails into a big wooden statue of a Field Marshall, and may jolt you if you think Allied and Axis powers were funded differently. The U.K. and the U.S. sponsored similar popular financial mobilizations, complete with bombastic slogans (no statues, though).	2004-06-07

Business coach Terry Pearce teaches you how to put the personal perspective back into your professional communications. With a credible and authoritative voice, he explains how authentic human connection is missing from today's communications, even though people crave it, especially as they evaluate who they trust to lead them through rapid change. He maintains that leaders who communicate authentically and passionately will inspire loyalty and make their mark. While Pearce is clearly convinced about the importance of inspiring your constituents, the pace of his book won't exactly move your spirit. He walks you slowly and carefully through the discipline he uses to help clients rediscover their authentic voices and craft messages that resonate. His corporate and political client list is quite select, but we find his communication strategies relevant for anyone who is leading change - whether you are building a small community or a large company.	2004-06-07

Rich has used his creative juices to write a book that promises to help your brain come up with its own storm of ideas. The book covers the basics of using a creative environment to brainstorm and develop new ideas. While some of the concepts discussed are fundamental, they are also classics. About 40% of the book consists of interviews with highly regarded creative thinkers in various fields - a key asset given the premise that one way to become creative is to learn from those who have already mastered this art form. In today's \\"by-the-numbers\\" corporate culture, finding new and better ways to get the job done is a valuable skill. We strongly recommends this book to those who need a more creative approach to daily tasks.	2004-06-06

This book is essentially a compendium of standard marketing lore repackaged as a new gospel of brand building. Breezily if sometimes awkwardly written, it provides some useful insight into how technology and social changes have reduced the importance of advertising and magnified the impact of person-to-person chatter. Abundant examples, anecdotes and observations on current events help keep it relevant to contemporary business. Given that books trying to catch the next wave of what works can be called a success if they deliver a single insight that a reader can use effectively, we find this book successful and worth reading.	2004-06-06

We assigned writer prepared this recommendation on a lovely, though warm summer day, while butterflies fluttered over a stand of purple thistles. Until he read this book, it seemed like a peaceful scene. Then, it seemed full of threats and hidden perils. He wondered if his building is strong enough to protect against a nuclear attack. What will his family do if someone sprays anthrax spores from a crop duster? Is there a clear spot in the basement to store enough gas masks, and which ones? This book will make you paranoid, too. It says that the threat of an attack is real and growing. You could laugh that off, except that the police just busted an arms dealer for trying to bring missiles into the U.S., except that someone mailed anthrax to strangers, except that there used to be towers at the World Trade Center.

Timely and dense, this comprehensive treatment of risk assessment and management maps the minefield of business and financial risks. Although professional-level information on banking and financial risk management cannot avoid a certain intensely mathematical character, this volume also pays careful attention to the \\"softer\\" side, and stresses the importance of cultural and attitudinal factors. It is a very well-balanced presentation of the subject. However, this very valuable information is written in a turgid, repetitive, convoluted and confusing style that makes it a chore to read. This risk could have been managed by a ruthless editor able to cut half of the undergrowth to clear a path to the meaning. Are advice to bankers and risk managers: brew some strong coffee and slog through the text. The content is too important to ignore.	2004-06-06

Brand managers seek another shining goal: public adoration and identification. Author John Simmons shares that quest, but his knights in shining armor are writers. If the real legacy of King Arthur isn't the still-missing Grail, but the magic of enduring storytelling, Simmons is a sword-carrier in that crusade. He somewhat self-indulgently advocates a creative experiment in brand management based on examples from his firm. In his experience, the most effective approach to brand building is to have \\"creative\\" writers - not corporate managers and certainly not non-creative writers - devise stories that are \\"true to the brand.\\" Such stories, he believes, are the most powerful medium for conveying brand strengths. As with most myths, readers may wish for more empirical evidence, even while enjoying his observations about the English language and its limitations. We recommend this book to brand managers and corporate communicators who want to use language more creatively in hopes of creating that \\"Holy Grail\\" of a story.	2004-06-06

In this volume, two battle-scarred veterans of what might be called \\"The Leadership Wars\\" - that is, the exhaustive effort over several decades to define the elusive nature of leadership and how it can best be nurtured - present insights on leadership that are based on a series of formal surveys conducted with companies nationwide. They also present 16 core competencies that affect the perception of whether you are, or aren't, a great leader. In many ways, they demystify leadership. Being a great leader, they tell us, isn't a matter of genetics or tea leaves: by studying what it takes to be a great leader, you can become one yourself. We strongly recommend this book for followers who want to become leaders, and for leaders who would like to be a little less lonely at the top.	2004-06-06

Christopher Culp definitively combines a thorough reference work on company-wide risk management with a sweeping discussion of the best hedging practices. Since this is also a textbook, you'll find the kind of math that would make even Einstein sweat. But, as the author notes, he's written this book for senior managers, so you have a note from the teacher that you can skip the math and statistics if you have a staff for that. Instead, apply your executive thinking skills to absorbing Culp's excellent lessons in risk management theory and practice. We recommend this book to senior managers and directors - in other words, any executives who create, implement or supervise risk management strategies.	2004-06-06

Prophets of doom have always made entertaining reading. In his latest fire-and-brimstone warning, Robert R. Prechter, Jr., an experienced forecaster of long-term economic and social trends, says financial Armageddon is just around the corner. While his technical analysis (\\"Wave Theory\\") may appear to be stock-market astrology, readers may appreciate his examination of the basic functions of money and credit, his argument that worldwide central banking has fundamentally altered these functions, and his perceptive comparisons of the late 1990s with the Roaring Twenties. Prechter might have appealed to a broader audience by toning down his graphs and technical talk, and focusing instead on his investment suggestions: If the market turns down, you'll save your skin, but even in a bull market, keeping your money safe can't hurt. We recommend this book to anyone looking for bear-market investment advice, as well as those interested in technical analysis or an opinionated view of business and market cycles.	2004-06-06

It could be as simple as tearing out your office doors and walls, and hiring a few dyslexics.

It is not printed on paper, but on a waterproof polymer with the heft of good paper and more strength, a substance that reflects the right amount of light, yet holds the ink fast. It seems like an impossible fantasy, but so does much of what the authors propose about design and ecology. They speak with the calm certainty of the ecstatic visionary. Could buildings generate oxygen like trees? Could running shoes release nutrients into the earth? It seems like science fiction. Yet, here is this book, on this paper. The authors make a strong case for change, and just when you're about to say, \\"if only,\\" they cite a corporation that is implementing their ideas. However, it's hard to believe their concepts would work on a large scale, in the face of powerful economic disincentives. We believe authors do aim some of their criticism at obsolete marketing and manufacturing philosophies, but the overall critique is well worth reading.	2004-06-06

The revolutionary approach that Bernd H. Schmitt is advocating here wouldn't sound so radical to anyone who has ever been in therapy: be aware, see things from other people's point of view, address their concerns. If you've been in $150 an hour territory, this isn't radical, but in the suites of marketing, the author contends, it is brand new. The book is an interesting follow up to the author's earlier seminal work on the broader theory of customer experience. Entitled Experiential Marketing, that work made the case for a customer-experience focus. This book is more of a practical how-to, professorially organized into a neat near-outline format. Here, Schmitt makes the case for dissecting, designing and then improving, the customer's experience with your product. We recommend this book of marketing therapy to anyone selling a product or service - and it is lots less expensive than putting your consumers on the couch.	2004-06-06

Successful ad campaigns are not linear developments where a business need meshes straightforwardly with an effective creative approach and actually produces successful tangible results. Instead, building memorable, provocative advertising campaigns is such a complex, political task, both rational and emotional, that a successful campaign is a wonder. Veteran advertising expert Jon Steel contends that building a good campaign is the common sense responsibility of the account planner - the new nexus of the consumer, agency creative staff, client and researchers. Steel shows the pitfalls of misguided research and creative arrogance as he explains that a good business-oriented account planner can help produce wonderfully effective, often simple, ad campaigns. His witty, erudite book concludes with its best case study: a look inside the successful &quot;Got Milk&quot; campaign for the California milk industry. We recommend this book to those who buy and sell advertising and to anyone working at an ad agency.	2004-06-03

Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz offer a lot of solid, common sense advice. The authors recommend going to bed and getting up at a consistent time - not exactly Ben Franklin's \\"early to bed, early to rise,\\" but close. They recommend regular exercise. They say it's good to work and to rest, and each has its place. They say to examine yourself and try to see yourself as others see you. In other words, they recommend many time-honored techniques of physical, mental and spiritual growth,combined with prioritizing how you use your energy and how you recharge your batteries. This attitude makes the book unique. The principles may be ancient, but we find the vehicle distinctly contemporary, a combo of New Age jargon and workout-style performance charting, with (at last) a key to time management that makes sense and captures all areas of one's life. Some readers will find that thrilling, others will groan.	2004-06-03

New products accelerate consumerism and a truly innovative launch can re-ignite corporate balance sheets, but new product attrition is high. For every seven new product ideas floated, about four enter development, one and a half are launched and only one succeeds (25% to 45% of new products flop). Yet intrepid corporations innovate and live to recount their tales to happy shareholders. The book presents every conceivable detail of the launch process - evaluation, management, best practices, game plans and even the seemingly impossible, incorporating new ideas into corporate thinking. So, what are the shortcomings? Well, there's not enough service industry info and there is too much redundancy. Processes are listed, sub-processes are listed and sub-sub-processes, until the reader gets lost in lists and stages. Still, if you retain the energy to try, this book provides the theoretical and operational framework for launching new products. All you need is that billion dollar idea. We recommend this book to idea people in marketing, technology, R &amp; D and sales.	2004-06-03

This volume is infinitely more thoughtful than most of the books that point to the expected insolvency of the Social Security system and pronounce that the fiscal sky is falling. After all, the U.S. economy has weathered plenty of fiscal crises before, but those in power have barely addressed this one. Authors Laurence J. Kotlikoff and Scott Burns ask you to realize that the government is saddling your children with unbearable debt. One by one, they strip away all the supposed answers to the demographic bulge and economic bust that characterize the impending mass retirement of the baby boom generation. They demonstrate that the dwindling number of working-age citizens simply will not be able to support the coming onslaught of retirees. The python has eaten the rabbit, but will it be able to swallow? Kotlikoff's &quot;generational accounting&quot; explains that government is running up charges on our kids' credit cards. And like any bill that doesn't get paid, this one will keep getting bigger. We recommend this nicely crafted book to all responsible citizens.	2004-06-03

Reading James E. Hughes Jr.'s book is like sitting down in an easy chair with brass rivets gleaming in burgundy leather, in a trusted old family friend's parlor, to obtain a kindly word of advice. You can almost smell the pipe tobacco and taste the brandy as you read. Hughes gently and wisely guides people who want to preserve their family's wealth on how to think beyond the current fiscal year. This book is genuine and straightforward, with insights gained over many years. Hughes covers creating a family mission statement, instituting a family bank or private trust company, mentoring the next generation, family governance, philanthropy and much more. His most important contribution, however, is the perspective he offers on the human side of the equation. Even the richest families are doomed to squander their inheritances, he cautions, unless they recognize the importance of the intellectual and human development of their family members. We highly recommends this book of sage advice to anyone who hopes to keep it all in the family.	2004-06-03

The author grins, distinguished, gray-haired, gray-suited, from the dust jacket of this book, looking like everything a hokey, hustling confidence man should be. The book's subtitle, promising \\"everything you want,\\" seems designed to provoke skepticism. But, hey, it's the new age: give this the benefit of the doubt - the confidence at stake here is yours. The core recommendation is simple and undeniably effective: define your goals, write them down, make a plan to achieve them and work on the plan every day. How could you fail if you really did this? Whether you would achieve \\"everything you want\\" is another matter, but you can't fault the method. Putting it to work is the hard part. To preview the gist of the book or review the meat of it, we recommend the convenient bullet charts that concisely repeat: take charge of your life, set goals, plan, implement and progress. If the message is repeated often enough, you might even write something down and just do it.	2004-06-03

As the army's touchstone for leadership, The U.S. Army Leadership Field Manual stresses ethics, high moral character and the honorable refusal to obey unlawful orders. This volume makes you ask, &quot;How could the prison abuse incidents in Iraq in 2004 have happened?&quot; American army training repeatedly emphasizes moral leadership, character and integrity, as seen in this primary field manual of leadership, which is used by soldiers and officers everywhere. Read the principles that helped shape such leaders such as Marshall, Eisenhower, Schwarzkopf and Powell. You can employ many of their lessons of moral courage and determination in the corporate boardroom.<br />We highly recommend this very readable book for those who seek to put current events into clearer context and to make use of their lessons.	2004-06-03

Most books about economics tend to be rather dry and technical. Not this one. Diane Coyle writes with humor and grace, infusing her erudition into lively prose, never burdening the reader or demanding that you patiently suffer through academic digressions. She views economics not as a subject but as yoga; it's not a bunch of stuff you ought to know but rather a way of learning and reflection. Coyle manages to touch on all of the major contemporary economic issues - literally, sex, drugs and rock and roll - and to make it clear how economic logic relates to such phenomena as sexual behavior, drug taking, war, fashion, major league sports and the Internet. This is an interesting, amusing book by an excellent author, both saucy and unconventional. We know that it might not help you make a lot of money - it's not that kind of book - but believes that it will make you richer in other ways.	2004-06-03

Author Braden Glett is bold enough to take on not only efficient market theory and index funds, but also the investment approaches advocated by such luminaries as Peter Lynch, Warren Buffett, John Bogle and their ilk. Although Glett does not name these names, he finds plenty to disagree with in almost every popular or conventionally recommended investing strategy. That makes this book provocative and interesting. It's always good to see conventional wisdom shaken. However, the author writes in a very difficult style, and his message hits various grammatical and logical road blocks due to a shaky editing job. With that caveat, we believe that investors and traders may want to check this short book, as long as they take the author's recommendations as opinion - he offers little in the way of solid research to back his contentions, but he raises some potentially useful doubts.	2004-06-03

This terrific book wastes no words and no time, but delivers the goods. Jack Mitchell, CEO of two high-end clothing stores in Connecticut, offers solid (if not all new) principles of customer service and relationship management in a personal, lively, entertaining way. The book is immediately applicable to retail and small businesses, and sheds much-needed light on managing a family business. The book draws a straight line from customer service to business success. The author, whose warmth and candor is totally endearing, may be faulted for denying that location matters. After all, his stores sit in one of the most affluent regions in the U.S., so he would probably enjoy some measure of success even with mediocre customer service. And, his customer service is great, intense to the point of being instructive. If he is overenthusiastic about his formula, that's to be expected of a salesman. We find a lot of useful material here for anyone in a customer-contact business and, as a bonus, this familial saga is really fun to read. Highly recommended.	2004-06-03

The word crash strikes fear into any investor's heart. Fear not, writes scientist Didier Sornette, who has crunched the numbers (not to mention the probabilities and log periodicities) and has determined that crashes are, in fact, quite normal and predictable. If prices are soaring and everyone you know says profits are guaranteed, get ready. Sornette backs up his argument with countless charts, formulas and phrases such as &quot;spontaneous symmetry-breaking regime.&quot; Still, there's enough plain English here to enlighten the lay reader. We suggest this book to traders and investors looking for a unique analysis of market crashes.	2004-06-03

Explaining China is a favorite avocation of many Chinese in the West. They usually state that Chinese and Western values are opposed, and that Chinese values are not only different but superior. This fairly typical book can be straightforward and informative, particularly when the author discusses the decision-making process in China and warns that `yes' and `no' probably don't mean what the average, unsubtle American understands them to mean. But stay skeptical of the author's generalizations about Chinese (Dragon) and Western (Cowboy) motivations. He stresses the supposed \\"collective\\" disposition of Chinese, but anyone with China experience will wonder just how \\"collective\\" the Chinese really are. In an often-used saying, the Chinese compare themselves to grains of sand - to emphasize their difficulty in getting together and cooperating. Sometimes the book describes fact, and sometimes fantasy that Chinese wish were fact. It can be as useful to know a people's fantasies as it is to know their facts so, properly read, we find this book to be a useful addition to the bibliography on doing business in China. (There are, by the way, some annoying proofreading errors, most egregiously the erroneous pinyin spelling of the Chinese word for face.)	2004-06-03

This pretty good book about brands and brand management is not as neat and orderly as the subtitle suggests - the so-called \\"8 principles\\" are rather vague meandering digressions. But the digressions are immensely entertaining and even educational. Learning how Nike and Starbucks handle marketing is quite worthwhile. Of course, the author oversimplifies, over-promises and over-promotes himself. But what do you expect of a marketing maven? The book's big virtue is that it repeatedly reinforces the fact that brand building boils down to having the common sense to think first about what you are trying to accomplish, and then set about doing it without getting distracted. How simple to say, how hard to do. If you want to try, we say this is just the book for you to read over your morning cup of coffee from guess who.	2004-06-03

Sure, you worry about what changes the future will bring for your business. But do you have a sensible and logical way to respond to the uncertainties that keep you up at night? If not, this intriguing book will set you on the right path. British corporate strategist Gill Ringland offers persuasive evidence that scenario planning is a worthwhile pursuit, and she recounts in useful detail her own experiences and those of large corporations looking for an edge up on the future. The book is organized in four sections: the links between scenarios and strategic planning, a rundown on different theoretical approaches (French School, Futures Group, CSM, Copenhagen Institute, and more), a set of eight case histories and several examples of actual, step-by-step scenarios. While Ringland's writing is inconsistent and can be dense and jargony, she nevertheless offers plenty of useful information that serves as a path for anyone embarking on scenario planning. We suggest this book to managers and corporate strategists seeking ways to deal with the uncertain future.	2004-06-03

Leadership guru John Adair talked with a bright young executive about leaders and the tenets of leadership, and recorded the conversations in this unique, philosophical book. Adair addresses tough questions about leadership and drills down beyond management and deep into human nature. He doesn't bother with leadership buzzwords, but instead discusses in meaningful terms the qualities that make a leader effective. People aren't born leaders, Adair says, they are made. Although the book is a bit too philosophical at times, the conversations between the author and the young executive are thought provoking, and the quotes peppered throughout the book are memorable. If you aspire to transform your management abilities into true leadership skills, we encourage you to sit down with the professor and his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; and enjoy the conversation.	2004-06-03

This book offers numerous useful principles that will help anyone become a better conversationalist and a more responsive listener. Read carefully because gems of very valuable content are scattered through the entire book, a sentence here, a quotation there, buried in long, interesting digressions about the author's life, people she's known and clients she's worked with over time. A judicious editor could have made a very sharp and effective pocket book out of this material, which is about managing intense, strong discussions with skill. As it is, you'll have to do some digging, but you'll have a perfectly good time doing it, particularly if you are a fan of New Age mantras and can handle a little touchy-feely vocabulary. We assure you that the lessons you'll learn about conversations - including fierce ones - will stand you in good stead.	2004-06-03

Keeps - researchers and consultants in workplace learning and performance - emphasizes making training fun and interactive. While their basic learning principles will be familiar to those in the field, they enliven their book with examples, exercises and research. The authors distinguish among training, instruction and education. They note the differences among various types of knowledge. Then, they explain the major factors that motivate people to learn and show how to apply these principles in hands-on teaching situations. Charts, illustrations, quizzes, and short chapter summaries enrich the book. We believe that even professionals already familiar with the field will enjoy this refreshing and lively look at how to help people learn. And if you are hiring trainers, this is what they should know.	2004-06-03

The subtitle of this book promises the &quot;untold story&quot; of dirty international financial dealings. That's not quite what it delivers, because the book compiles already-published accounts, public reports and Congressional testimony, and adds to them. Given that money laundering involves drug dealers, terrorists and slavers, the book has some titillating asides about sex, violence and filthy money. Author Peter Lilley explains precisely how money laundering works, including an introduction to the practices and techniques that have proven most successful. While praising the author's reportorial depth, we note one dilemma that emerges from such thoroughness: we hope this book doesn't fall into the hands of someone who wishes to take up money laundering but is unsure how to proceed. Business people who want to avoid being victimized should take particular note of the chapter discussing well-known checks-and-balances, controls and best practices.	2004-06-03

Despite the rather strained analogy and the authors' laborious attempts to make it amusing for 248 pages, this book does offer some genuine magical flashes of customer service insight. You will learn a great deal that is worth knowing. Many of these insights are the kind of pointers on customer service that bear repeating, rereading and remembering. The magic metaphor is a worthy attempt to make them fresh again, and to examine the elements of place, performance and process, step by step. We recommend this book for new magicians, and even for magicians with experience who need to renew their customer service razzle-dazzle. Now, show `em how you pull that rabbit out of your hat!	2004-06-03

Financial advisors are hard-pressed. They used to be the investor's primary source of market information and investing counsel. Now investors can get information and advice for free on the Internet or from a variety of financial publications. Moreover, some of the best free advice that investors get warns them against dealing with financial advisors, who may or may not be acting in their best interest. It's hard to compete when other people are giving away what you have to charge for, but authors Cliff Oberlin and Jill Powers say it's possible. How? Focus your practice. Don't resist change - embrace it. And, we recommend, read this book for a detailed and easy-to-follow roadmap to financial advisory success.	2004-06-03

Brian Tracy discusses how to apply the major principles of success and how to achieve your goals. These principles are very familiar to anyone who has participated in success programs or read success literature, so you will sense some d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Still, Tracy writes with an authoritative, engaging voice, and presents these basic principles as a well-organized quick read, complete with examples. His description of the various \\"laws\\" of nature that produce success, such as the \\"Law of Cause and Effect,\\" the \\"Law of Subconscious Activity\\" and the \\"Law of Belief,\\" contribute to the book's feeling of authority, although the basis for calling such patterns of action and outcome \\"laws\\" may be uncertain. Yet, the device works well here, and many readers like to be told exactly what steps to take. In short, we recommend this zippy retelling of popular prescriptions for success - though the prescription is like mother's old-fashioned medicine: nothing new, but it goes down very well.	2004-06-03

Barber shows you how to make adversity hit the deck and give you 20 push-ups. His lessons on becoming a great leader are simple - stop thinking of yourself, learn to think of others, lead by example, persist in the face of adversity and so forth - but the process by which Army Rangers learn those lessons is complex and fascinating. Barber gives you insight into the brutal training that heroes such as the late Pat Tillman, the NFL star-turned-Ranger, endure for the cause of freedom. Barber profiles ten Rangers who applied lessons from their training to overcome difficulties. Readers see the circumstances under which these lessons were imprinted and deployed. In an age when people offer excuses as readily as business cards, Rangers believe the way to succeed is to stop making excuses. That's a valuable lesson in business and life. We highly recommends this book to those leading others through the hazards of business.	2004-06-03

Most likely, if you're interested in achieving time management, you're not interested in spending a lot of your precious time reading about it. English author Frances Kay understands this and she knows her audience. Her succinct, practical guide offers tips and suggestions in such a way that you can open it to any page and glean valuable advice at a glance. Kay digs deeply into building time management skills in the office, though she glosses over time management outside the workplace. Although the book contains very few groundbreaking ideas, it does contain several &quot;kickstart tips&quot; that are very much like proverbs. And like proverbs, they should be taken to heart - they'll help you improve your time use. If you feel as if you've lost control of the minutes in your day, we assure you that you can begin the process of taking them back by picking up this book.	2004-06-02

Authors Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries and Elizabeth Florent-Treacy idealistically foresee a new era where visionary, innovative CEO's will lead a new type of employee. Through insightful interviews, they position Richard Branson of Virgin, Percy Barnevik of ABB and David Simon of British Petroleum as icons of the modern, improved CEO. Certainly, Branson and Simon seem to be valid role models and their leadership of European global companies presents interesting alternatives.  Although it is not reflected in this 1999 book, today Barnevik's reputation is tarnished in the wake of a 2002 severance pay scandal and problems that BusinessWeek refers to as &quot;the mess at ABB.&quot;  For good or ill, this book will provoke you to ask if emphasizing a leader's charismatic ability to motivate distracts attention from critical core business issues. Despite their varied outcomes, these charismatic visionaries created family-like corporate cultures and inspired their employees. Thus, they demonstrated that the new economic era requires a new type of leader. Whether they together constitute a composite of that leader is another question. We recommend this solid book to management students and to upcoming executives.	2004-06-02

Continuing the current hot trend of couching business counsel in fables, author Patrick Lencioni takes on the ogre of the deadly dull meeting and through story and advice, wrestles it to the ground. The book is in large part about boring meetings and the author manages to reproduce their tone exactly. The protagonists are the boss, Casey, and an employee named Will who eventually loses his temper in the face of one more stifling, useless meeting. The author plants lessons about meetings throughout the story, revealed by the characters' experiences. However, after the fable comes an undiluted section of advice: about 40 pages of straightforward, expository prose about how to have more effective, engaging meetings. If you want useful workday advice and prefer to save fairytales - even those with built-in lessons - for bedtime, start there. We welcome this solid guidance on how to make meetings work better.	2004-06-02

Employee development manager Sophie Oberstein and marketer Jan Alleman show why and how training programmers need to become marketers. To help you meet that demand, their workbook explains to trainers how to create and implement a marketing strategy that proves training programs boost the bottom line. They also spend time on the critical area of motivation. The authors provide a useful tool-kit for designing a marketing plan, including instructions on writing and designing promotional materials. The book serves as a good introduction to marketing for its primary target market, so we can recommend it confidently to professionals involved in training and development. One caution: the workshop format of the book is great if you are learning, and want to stop to answer questions or fill in the blanks, but it doesn't make for smooth reading.	2004-06-02

This advertiser-supported book is unusual, and not only because the reader may find it surprising to find advertising pages in a book. Offering various levels of commentary and analysis on a spectrum of risks and risk management approaches, the editor has brought together a diverse group of executives and experts from firms that provide risk management services. Sections cover value and cost, change and continuity, governance and control, integrity and accountability, knowledge and systems, financial risks, legal considerations and workplace and employment practices. While some pieces do have a promotional bent, several are quite sophisticated and merit careful reading. The section on Sarbanes-Oxley implementation, written by an Ernst &amp; Young senior manager, is certainly timely. It is also distinctive, since many of the book's essays focus on Europe, particularly the United Kingdom. The chapter on managing intellectual property risks, written by two experts from Clifford Chance, also offers tips that are well worth remembering. In sum.<br />we recommend this somewhat surprising package of useful and relevant information.	2004-06-02

Marquardt writes with the zeal of a revival tent preacher, filled with the sincere belief that action learning can help solve any problem, meet any challenge or achieve any aspiration. As he clearly explains, action learning is intended to build both knowledge and leadership. He sets out the steps your organization should pursue to implement action learning, and to use it well. He includes questions, checklists and extensive examples. All he omits are any caveats or cautions about this approach. He's a booster and an expert, just so you know where he's coming from.

While author Cyndi Crother acknowledges that another wildly successful business book about this fish market preceded her, she has insights to offer based on time she spent with the free-wheeling, fish-throwing denizens of Seattle's World Famous Pike Place Fish. Her book picks up on the spirit of past coverage, but she adds the fishmongers' philosophical ruminations to her own slightly mushy, eclectic New Age managerial wisdom. This is not for strictly business readers, but it will ring a chord with those who seek to balance life and work. It's about warmth, and treating people with sensitivity, and creating your own reality by aligning your thoughts and actions with your intentions. It is also about workplace comradeship, customer service and how to sell the heck out of fish all day long. It's all pretty entertaining, given the lively background of the fish market.

This textbook offers a detailed, panoptic view of the field of insurance and risk management. Author Etti G. Baranoff does not seem to promote a philosophical, narrative or analytical point of view on the subject. Instead, she aims to provide students with a dense introduction to the field's bedrock information. Therefore, she presents a vast number of facts related to insurance and risk management, but generally refrains from taking a position on them. This is the sort of book one is assigned as the well-chosen, required text in a course on insurance. The author expertly defines every necessary term and explores every important aspect of the decision to buy or forego insurance, including legal implications, policy variants and alternative products. We suggest that corporate risk managers may want to keep it on their bookshelves for its excellent definitions and its appendices, which offer illustrative excerpts from several different insurance policies. Even those who are not in the risk management business could benefit from some chapters, especially those recommending ways to calculate the appropriate amount of insurance.	2004-06-02

Long time market commentator Woody Dorsey, the theorist behind market semiotics, sees Wall Street as a continuum of the agora or the medieval street fair: a place where people congregate and trade, motivated by their own psychological drives. But if investors are still behaving based on the same visceral emotions that drove exchanges of goats in ancient bazaars, what does that forecast about how the market will act today? According to Dorsey, quite a lot. Interspersed with anecdotes that range from biography to paleontology to horse training, he offers principles and techniques that explain marketplace behavior in a way investors can understand and utilize. Begin with how he scans newspapers, a methodology worth remembering, and continue through his explanation of the Triunity Theory, a new system for understanding behavioral finance. Agree or disagree with his contrarian thinking, we believe his interesting diversions and innovative economic thinking will sweep you along. Dorsey brings many subjects together, but the two most interesting are, of course, why people behave as they do and how it affects the market and your money.	2004-05-20

In most industries, those advocating change initiatives (usually consultants) only need to run around warning that the sky is falling in order to be heard - and indeed in many industries the sky does look a bit shaky. Apparently, that claxon-sounding process is a bit more complicated in the banking industry, where no one wants to suggest that something might be, um, unsound. Kern and Dombret have adapted the phrase \\"a less rosy future\\" to describe their concerns regarding the issues that European retail banks face today. Make no mistake, however, despite their delicate and responsible phrasing, Kern and Dombret see an immediate need for banks to undergo a serious transformation. The traditional market activities of banks - the value chain - must be broken up into more specialized parts, and banks must find a market segment they can serve, and then adapt to serve it. While the topic is a bit specialized, we strongly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the future of banking.	2004-05-20

Those few who become sales millionaires without working to improve their skills were probably sustained by a doting aunt in the first place. But, those who look on sales as a business that can be learned and must be practiced and refined are the ones who usually become sales millionaires. Donald Moine and Ken Lloyd preach what they practice. Both men have earned a significant living selling themselves and selling what they learned in the process. Although they have never sold a car or a bungalow, their analysis of the salesperson's dilemma is specific and accurate. Their techniques for motivating sales excellence will ring true to everyone who ever faced a sales objection and drew a blank. Their suggestions for improving your sales potential are exact and practical. We recommend this book to sales professionals, sales managers and sales trainers.	2004-05-20

This book, first published in Japan in 1975, is a somewhat dated classic, since the first edition appeared at the high water mark of Japanese competitiveness. Japan's economic doldrums since 1990 probably ensure that few business people will emulate it now. In a way, the fact that the bloom is off Japan's chrysanthemum makes this book more useful and relevant than it was a quarter-century ago. Now that people aren't starry-eyed about Japan, it's possible to sort through the recommendations, take them with a grain of salt and find their deeper usefulness. The author is a famous McKinsey consultant, so the book is packed with charts and jargon. Ignore the jargon, the obsolete observations about how U.S. companies organize themselves and the anachronisms about Soviet-style central planning, now a relic. Focus instead on the examples and asides. We also note that this is a must-read for anyone working in Japan or competing against Japanese companies, if only because so many Japanese managers give it to their new hires as part of their training programs.	2004-05-20

Branding is a ubiquitous, but critical marketing function that can produce spectacular successes and catastrophic blunders. Highly visible branding failures, such as the ill-fated &quot;New Coke&quot; or Harley Davidson's silly attempt to peddle perfume, are first-order marketing blunders. Yet, while branding is critical, one wonders if branding alone, as author Matt Haig asserts, is the main reason Land Rover sales declined and General Motors stopped making Oldsmobiles. Other experts might address such failures from a more expansive perspective, citing financial, competitive, managerial, global and environmental factors. Haig notes that non-branding mistakes contribute to failure, but focuses on branding as the prime cause. As a result, his brand-centered explanations can seem strained, but he overcomes this concern with a long list of vignettes that effectively drive home important points about the causes of branding failures. We suggest this book to marketing, advertising, PR and customer service managers so they can learn from other people's mistakes.	2004-05-20

Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner use detailed research to show how leaders can achieve credibility. This book tells what caring leaders should do. If you are a leader, heed it. If you are managed - and not managing - don't assume that your leaders care as much as those shown here. You will be ill-prepared for harsh reality. As a leader, you should know that the global marketplace has changed greatly. Now, shareholders jettison stocks if earnings fall below expectations. Executives slash U.S. jobs and export the remaining jobs to India and China. This is an age of multi-billion-dollar paychecks for chief executive officers, but psychological insecurity for workers. In this turmoil, it's great to read what good leaders should do. The book is practical with a solid psychological grounding. Bottom line from us: these researchers are nice guys, writing for similarly nice guys. But not every leader is a nice guy. So trust, but verify. Or lead, and be nice.	2004-05-20

Only a brave pair of authors would try to tackle a topic as all-encompassing as the need for courage in the modern business world, but that is exactly what Drs. Merom Klein and Rod Napier have set out to do. Do they succeed? Not entirely. While their diagnosis of the organizational ills plaguing today's companies is spot-on, their prescriptions are generic, involving \\"creating a safe environment,\\" \\"building pride\\" and \\"keeping it fun.\\" Despite the obviousness of some of the sound advice in the later chapters, the book shines in its first 70 pages, in which the doctors present an original, enlightening analysis of how organizational changes have altered the roles and responsibilities of mid-level workers. Based on this fresh perspective, we think that all readers could use a little Courage.	2004-05-20

Anyone not familiar with the work of Thomas Sowell would be well advised to check out the blurbs on the back of the dust jacket of Basic Economics, where praise flows from conservative bastions like The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Times and the American Enterprise Institute. Take this as a warning that, even though Sowell's book does offer an excellent plain-English explanation of fundamental economics, its real mission is to explain how many societal catastrophes are caused by government policies he deems faulty. In so doing, he takes aim at minimum wage standards, rent control and, through his spirited defense of international trade, the anti-globalization crowd. But no matter which side of the ideological fence you occupy, we  suggest reading this book for its insightful distillation of some of our most passionate political debates down to their economic essentials.	2004-05-20

Career development expert Ron Fry focuses on how to prepare for a job interview and how to conduct yourself during the interview. While he covers some of the same ground he's covered in some of his other books and as well as the territory in other career books, such as What Color Is Your Parachute, Fry focuses helpfully on a critical job-finding skill - asking the right questions during your job interview. He tells you how to respond when the interviewer asks you, \\"Do you have any questions?\\", because your response indicates your level of interest in the job. Besides listing questions to ask or to modify to meet your own circumstances, Fry provides helpful preparatory questions you should ask yourself to clarify what kind of job you really want. We recommend this book to job seekers at the middle or lower management level. By the time you get to the executive suite, you'll know what else to ask.	2004-05-20

This book offers one-stop shopping for the nonprofit organization in need of money, political influence, credibility, free labor and all of the other benefits that members can bring. Not only does the book provide abundant information on recruiting members, it also offers, free and online, copies of forms and worksheets you can use to help advance your organization's membership campaign. It begins at the beginning, explaining what membership is. This may sound self-evident, but the very definition of membership has some surprising twists. This book will save you from making some very obvious mistakes - such as failing to convert people who contact you into members. It's a straightforward, no-nonsense workbook with excellent samples and examples. If you are an executive, board member, staffer or volunteer at a nonprofit, we offer its congratulations: at last, here's the right book for you.	2004-05-20

Six Sigma devotees may dispute the need to add anything to Six Sigma, but a shot of lean thinking provides a production boost. Author Michael L. George contends that Six Sigma reduces product quality variation but does nothing to improve delivery time. That may not be strictly true, and certainly is not beyond cavil. Nonetheless, the author's analysis and presentation of the Lean Six Sigma approach is lucid and straightforward. He explains Six Sigma itself much more clearly than some other writers on the subject. Even Six Sigma devotees will find nothing to object to in his treatment, and he provides some compelling examples of the success of the Lean Six Sigma approach. We recommend this book primarily to leaders and managers of firms that rely on factories and other production units. However, the author supplies practical information that may also be relevant to service providers and to every company that cares about customer service, efficient production and the bottom line.	2004-05-20

Robbins provides a broad overview of effective management principles. While many of these principles are familiar, Robbins writes in a compelling, authoritative style, and he uses behavioral research to bolster many of his suggestions, some of which go against common practice. Skeptical? Just look at his examples of companies that have used these methods successfully, and his comments from experts in the field. The chapters are organized into a series of short bites, presented as \\"truths\\" about different areas of management. This small easy-to-carry book is handy for reading in chunks while you wait or commute on the train. We recommend it as a handy summary of general management wisdom supported by the findings of behavioral research and nicely seasoned with occasional nuggets of information on effective, but less common, techniques.	2004-05-20

After the wave of corporate scandals and new regulations, a book like this needed to be written, particularly a book that covers the field of investor relations and includes advice from the leading professionals. This comes as close as anything you have been offered so far. Alas, its style and timeliness fall short (it offers clich&eacute;s couched in academic prose and presents year 2000 regulations as new), but it offer abundant information. This is a helpful and useful run-down, particularly Chapter 10, which covers proxy wars. Non-U.S. companies will also find Chapter 13 very relevant. If you need an IR overview, we believe you can satisfactorily start here.	2004-05-20

This book is like a clear lamp knifing through the fog of business, saying that what really matters is developing one clear unified concept of your business, declaring who you are and what you do. The key to achieving this &quot;unified truth&quot; is information. Most companies stack information in silos represented by business units, so one part of the company doesn't know what the other parts are doing. Authors Mark Hurd and Lars Nyberg of the NCR global information technology firm make a cogent case that the key to overcoming this shortcoming is to take information out of scattered departments and develop centralized storage facilities for its collection, processing and retrieval. Armed with this base, this &quot;unified truth,&quot; employees can become more customer-centric. One caveat, however, is that single view companies face the danger of tunnel vision. Sometimes companies need internal, competing views to be sure they consider the correct perspective. Although this book is an NCR public relations effort, it sets out a key point: if your firm isn't making information its top priority, you're could be falling behind the curve. We highly recommend this book to leaders and future leaders.	2004-05-20

In the latest edition of the College Grad Job Hunter, Brian D. Krueger, a post-college career authority, provides a highly targeted book on job hunting skills for recent college graduates. While others seeking entry level jobs can benefit, the emphasis is on how to prepare while you are still in college or just graduating. As such, it is a solidly written and well-organized book that views job hunting as a process and provides step-by-step techniques for searching for that ideal job. It is a useful how-to manual even if it duplicates some of the advice in other books, such as What Color is Your Parachute? Krueger helpfully includes sample letters, phone messages and job hunting Web sites and books. We recommend this good, basic book for all novice job hunters (not just freshly-minted college grads).	2004-05-20

If you skipped those economic or political lectures in your History of the Twentieth Century class, or if you simply need a refresher course, this hefty tome will walk you through the &quot;isms&quot; of the past 100 years. Editors Terence Ball and Richard Bellamy offer a remarkably thorough history that runs the gamut from fascism to Keynes, from feminism to environmentalism, from surrealism to mystical racism, and in a way that makes you realize that they're all intertwined. Be forewarned, though, this isn't light reading. It's a dense, academic work by major political thinkers. We suggest this book to anyone interested in putting today's political climate into historical context. If you are involved in the financial life of Europe or the United States, this is your back story.	2004-05-20

This blunt, irreverent book blurts out what many people in business have long suspected: nearly everything you learned in business school is wrong and most of what you read in corporate mission statements and strategic plans makes no sense. Author Jo Owen takes on all of the shibboleths of yesteryear's management literature - romance your customer, communicate, invite change and so on - and demolishes each one. The approach is raw and blatant; it stands in relation to ordinary business books much as punk rock stands in relation to easy listening. The author seems to be saying something no one else has dared to say. But do not confuse the novelty of the presentation with the novelty of the material itself. To some extent, Owen's recommendations revise the conventional wisdom of the recent bubble years and replace it with a new and - if not more sober - certainly less effervescent orthodoxy. We recommend taking a thoughtful look. What people are starting to say more and more often, Jo Owen has perhaps expressed with the most originality.	2004-05-19

It's hard to find a book that doesn't emphasize only one phase of the sales process, such as prospecting, at the cost of another phase, such as presentations. Cy Charney's authoritative manual lives up to its name and thoroughly covers all areas. The tips provide a comprehensive compendium of predominant wisdom on how to sell. This is essentially a book of lists - lists of prospecting tips, how to make presentations, how to overcome objections, how to close and more. This handbook is notable more for its breadth than the originality of its ideas, some of which are targeted to beginners. However, it does offer up-to-date coverage of newer technologies, such as Internet searching. The volume's minimalist organizational design actually suits its goal: providing straightforward information to those with a sincere desire to master the art of selling. We very highly recommend this book to those pursuing the noble profession of sales.	2004-05-19

Veteran Washington reporter Bob Woodward continues to shine his lamp into the shadows of U.S. political life. Woodward has an uncanny ability to present a point of view without appearing biased, perhaps because he approaches truth with a complex worldview and eschews viewing individual leaders as either particularly good or evil. Although you may not want to hear what he learned, Woodward interviewed more than 75 officials directly involved in the war on terrorism, including spending three and a half hours with President Bush. He found out that Bush considered, and then planned, war in Iraq long before voters knew, and that his chief advisors debated it vigorously. Right or wrong, he seems to say, Bush's pivotal team members - Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell, Franks - were entirely earnest. We  strongly recommend this book to anyone who wonders how the U.S. became the proud new owner of all of Iraq's problems. It gives you a breathtaking behind-the-scenes understanding of the decisions, for good or ill, that led to America's second war against Saddam.	2004-05-19

The notion of growing your business like a garden may not seem particularly original, but the direction these authors take their sales advice in is quite fresh. In an unusual and welcome act of focus, they dwell on one aspect of the sales professional's life: how to prolong your career and stick with it, despite the weeds and rocks hurled continually at today's selling professional. Their advice is practical and couched in colorful anecdotes and garden metaphors. Sales advice blooms throughout the story of an imaginary sales professional, Marsha Molloy, who is struggling to get her professional groove back. Since burnout is an epidemic in the sales profession, this book is a valuable addition to the topic. It offers solid advice, or &quot;sales seeds,&quot; in a colorful and engaging way. We strongly recommend it to all those who seek to do more than make a sale - and, rather, aim to build a sales career.	2004-05-19

Everything from world events to traffic jams contributes to stress and anger. Controlling the emotions related to anger is difficult, but it leads to personal growth, assertiveness and happiness. Anger management can benefit everyone. Counselor Carol Jones' conversational, well-researched book provides insightful suggestions for identifying and controlling anger and its related emotional and behavioral components. Jones uses personality and situational self-assessments to match anger management techniques with individual personality styles. This is not solely a self-help book filled with checklists; in fact, it is light on tricks and quick techniques. Instead, it is an entertaining, informative explanation of what anger is and how it happens. The author also suggests ways to become more assertive, which will make you happier, more effective, less angry and less stressed out. We believe that managers in human resources and other departments can use this book to enhance employee productivity and improve communications. And if you'd like a little help defusing the stimuli that trigger your anger, that's here as well.	2004-05-19

You might expect a book that draws on the business-military parallel to focus almost exclusively on leadership. Actually, though it does cover leadership, this book is fascinating for its lessons on how to apply military tactics on the modern corporate battlefield. The authors cut through the testosterone-laced fog of war by applying a reasoned, analytical, strategic approach to conflict, whether in business or on the field of combat. They take an in-depth look at the principles that guide the Marines, such as maneuver warfare, and explain how to utilize those principles in business. They also provide many practical Marine Corps ideas for making your organization more competitive and profitable. This well-written book also offers case studies for insight and practical application, so you can directly benefit from the role model offered. We highly recommend this volume to those bold enough to lead their organizations to a successful, \\"mission accomplished.\\"	2004-05-19

A cynic might be tempted to sneer at a book published by a major Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software vendor - specifically, SAP - urging CFOs to make better use of ERP. This software is intended to tie all business functions together in a commonly accessible bundle. Having overspent on this and other information technologies, many executives question its value. Indeed, a recent Harvard Business Review article carried in its title the blunt, provocative suggestion that, \\"IT Doesn't Matter.\\" Well, these authors believe it matters, because the IT processes and systems that the CFO supports directly affect the bottom line. The book offers valuable case histories, specific technological and managerial counsel, informative charts and candid input from executives. It covers the CFO's perspective on integrating information technology processes into a company's services, supply chains, culture and analytics. Each chapter ends with a useful \\"CFO Checklist.\\" The cases are promotional and very tech-friendly, so read between the lines. This book is, after all, a marketing initiative. Still, we find the text specific, knowledgeable and worth reading.	2004-05-19

This excellent guide explains a methodology that can help anyone in sales. This sales approach depends essentially on seeing the sale through the customer's eyes, and involving the customer in designing a solution to his or her own problems. This approach goes against some standard practices in sales, but those standard practices antagonize customers and build distrust. Author Jeff Thull offers helpful reminders on the value of researching individual customers, picking the right entry point to an organization and other best practices. However, he sometimes seems over-enthusiastic and over-optimistic about his system's infallibility. After all, in some organizations, sales people who tried to follow this methodology would be criticized for failing to meet more conventional targets, such as number of calls per week. This detailed method for conquering many-level, multi-step sales is time and research-intensive, but highly effective. We applaud his emphasis on the value of asking and listening instead of speaking. Highly recommended.	2004-05-19

No financial innovation of the past half-century has been more important than option analysis. The notion that option analysis could help corporate managers make more effective investment decisions was bold news in the early 1980's, but did not make much of an impact beyond rather narrow circles. Options are hard to understand - the math can be intimidating and few people have been able to explain option analysis in a way that makes sense to the financial laity. This book is, therefore, long overdue. Marion A. Brach delivers the essential logic and analytical framework of real options to any corporate manager. The text can be heavy going at times, and the author has an annoying habit of referring to examples without explaining them (footnotes cite other publications where explanations may be found). Still, we recommend this book highly. It shows why there is more to management decisions than many managers may have heretofore considered.	2004-05-19

Concise and smoothly written, it delivers essential information without beating around the bush or leaving out anything important. Once it is on your shelf, don't let it gather dust. From strategic advice on which marketing method may work for you to concrete help on presentations, fee-setting and client relationships, this is packed with utility. Many professionals neglect marketing because the time spent at it isn't directly \\"billable.\\" Of course, that's like a farmer neglecting planting, because it isn't harvesting. The book is thorough, if not particularly innovative, and it does get a bit rah-rah at times, but those are minor quibbles. We recommend this practical, complete and essential set of instructions on how to generate clients for your professional service practice.	2004-05-19

This book should certainly be on every businessperson's reading list, and every legislator's, and every student's. It is a lucid, well-organized and admirably logical presentation of the role of innovation in capitalism, and the role of capitalism in innovation. Author William J. Baumol accomplishes something rare indeed by spanning the chasm between quantitative and qualitative economic writing. He has the verbal skill to write clearly and accessibly, explaining his points in plain if elevated and austere language, and illustrating them with interesting historical examples. His rigorous mathematical demonstration would satisfy the most demanding academic economist. Baumol's insight that capitalism's great achievement is to make innovation routine distinguishes this book from others on innovation, entrepreneurship and creativity. Although the lone inventor matters, ancient Rome and China had lone inventors and yet those empires did not produce economic growth on the scale that capitalism has produced it. Capitalism is distinctly productive because it makes innovation a self-sustaining and indispensable phenomenon, driving and driven by competition. We find this intriguing thesis well worth serious consideration.	2004-05-19

The good news is that this tome provides tremendous detail about its subject matter, retail banking in Europe. The bad news is that you have to really want to know a lot about this specific subject to penetrate its lack of organization and awkward writing style. The information is abundant, particularly about the past, although the book doesn't include insight about the future. European banking is full of threats, opportunities, reversals and challenges. It is subject to revolutionary reshaping by major political and economic events. Popular books don't tend to get written about such esoteric subjects unless they are post-mortems on disasters. Given that, we think this academic if thorough entry may be indispensable to people with a real need to know about the subject.	2004-05-19

Children between the ages of 8 and 14, dubbed \\"tweens\\" (\\"tweenagers\\") by the authors, are a curious group. They are also a lonely, insecure group with an engaging mix of naivet&eacute; and sophistication. Devilishly hard to capture, they are a rich economic prize, controlling an enormous amount of money of their own, and strongly influencing their families' purchases, even of major appliances. This book shows you what matters to these kids and what false notes to avoid if you want to tap into their buying power. We acknowledge that some readers may be uncomfortable with such tactics as setting up a web site that pretends to belong to a friendly child in order to attract kids and start buzz about some brand, but the book's reporting is accurate, practical and forward looking, for good or ill.	2004-05-19

This is an insider's stroll through the confusing and ominous woods where the beasts of economic reality meet the lambs of social responsibility. Author and corporate survivor Jeffrey Hollender (who wrote this with scribe Stephen Fenichell) clearly admires the cast of socially responsible companies, such as Ben &amp; Jerry's and The Body Shop. He covers the informal history of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) movement and his own troubling experiences as chief of a company that saw itself as socially responsible. His presentation is heartfelt, if short on rigorous logic. He candidly discusses having his ideals challenged and trying to justify his compromises. The book labels some behavior socially responsible and some socially irresponsible, but its yardstick is not clear. For example, it condemns the use of child factory labor in developing countries, yet never expresses awareness of the lack of practical alternatives for those children - perhaps starvation. The book explores both the value of the Corporate Social Responsibility movement and its uncomfortable contradictions. We recommend this trip inside the hard work of melding social responsibility with business.	2004-05-19

This may be the most thorough and methodical exposition of corporate governance and risk management now available. It is hard to imagine a facet of the subject this book does not address. Sustainable development, cross-border governance issues, directors' and officers' insurance, theory, practice - it's all here. The book does not aspire to be anything but comprehensive and factual. The section authors, each an expert in his or her subject, eschew any pretense of courting the reader with easy-to-read prose. They write not for the casual reader or the educated lay person, but for the professional with a consummate need to know the subject. That said, we believe this book should be part of every major corporate or business school library; it will have a long shelf life.	2004-05-19

Author Lilia Shevtsova gives an authoritative, if undramatic and less than perfectly organized, account of the rise of Vladimir Putin. Boris Yeltsin chose the anonymous, quiet former KGB colonel for one of the world's most powerful jobs, in part because of his loyalty. Putin's clear-eyed pragmatism and his visceral support of George W. Bush's war on terrorism have given Russia otherwise unattainable international significance. Now, will Putin use his power to reform Russia's political institutions and strengthen its framework of democratic governance? This quite readable book goes beyond the headlines and indicates that Russia is still a land of intrigue and mystery, where the only certainty is that there is none. Under that circumstance, Shevtsova has done an admirable job of framing how Russia reached its current state and what historical choices now confront it. The future of Russia is far from set. We very highly recommend this book to those who seek a deeper understanding of one of America's staunchest allies in the war on terror.	2004-05-19

This book aggregates a plethora of tips and techniques believed - sometimes on the basis of solid research - to boost employee loyalty and organizational productivity. Managers need to learn tactics that will bind employees to them personally and to their companies. Author Nancy S. Ahlrichs earnestly believes in the thesis that it is important to be a manager whom employees would chose to work for, that is, a manager of choice. Her advice ranges from quite helpful to self-evident to sort of impractical. For the greatest utility, be a choosy reader: adapt her counsel to your situation. We highly suggest reading this through and then keeping it handy and dipping into it from time to time, as if it were a book of proverbs.	2004-05-19

When last we saw Joe Meter, the fictitious hero of Subir Chowdhury's last Six Sigma book (The Power of Six Sigma), he was looking for work. His friend Larry Hogan introduced him to Six Sigma, which made Joe a huge success. According to the story, which is a novelistic construct for conveying business advice, now Joe is going to tutor Larry on a more advanced form of Six Sigma, one that delves into the very process of system design. This \\"meta-Six Sigma\\" appears to be a natural evolution of the basic Six Sigma approach, namely, to uncover the root causes of defects, inefficiency and customer dissatisfaction - and to fix them as part of the intrinsic design of the company and its processes. This book covers the design concept, but not the initial details of Six Sigma itself. Here, Chowdhury again explains a complex subject in a lucid manner, if you don't mind an alphabet soup of acronyms. We strongly recommend this book for anyone in management, or anyone who is experiencing a change initiative.	2004-05-19

This short volume collects some of the most time-honored principles of leadership and compiles them in a series of short, easy-to-read chapters. Author John Adair draws on some unlikely sources for his material, finding inspiration even in Cromwell, the fanatical Puritan revolutionary; in the experience of the German army during World War II and in other characters and events not usually cited in management tomes. Adair's classic on leadership, now reissued, is a very useful handbook that resembles inspirational reading more than an expository how-to. On the downside, the book needs tightening. In particular, the author's lists of &quot;key points&quot; tend to be vague, passive and general. Nonetheless, we believe that gem seekers will find useful nuggets of leadership counsel here and that business readers will enjoy the intriguing array of quotable stories and sources.	2004-05-19

Authors Dave Ulrich and Norm Smallwood use a bottom-line approach to assess various business intangibles that build actual value, such as a vision of future growth and improved capabilities. They present the keys to creating value by mustering intangible assets in a well-organized, highly structured way. Unfortunately, the intangible factors and the growth steps they discuss are well-traveled territory. But while other books may describe how to develop these \\"soft\\" qualities in a more intriguing or more original way, this volume handily dissects, quantifies and explains them step by step. Here, the vague is made concrete. Even a bean counter could understand the bottom line value of innovation, improved internal systems and enhanced organizational culture with this explanation. We recommend it to those who want to invest in intangible assets in a tangible setting, for very tangible reasons.	2004-05-19

Robinson and Dean M. Schroeder articulate a plain, obvious truth that hierarchical executives and managers may sometimes ignore: often the best ideas come not from the top, but from the little guy working in the cubicle or out on the assembly line. Their book predicts an 'idea revolution,' where companies realize that their employees' ideas are among their companies' most valuable resources. The book reviews the basics of how to set up an idea-generating system, how to reward employees effectively and how to keep managerial egos out of the way. The authors discuss several case studies that demonstrate the power of a good idea. A new idea? No. One is reminded of Andre Gide, who said, &quot;Everything has already been said, but because nobody was listening, we keep having to start all over again at the beginning.&quot; We recommend this book to any manager, executive or business owner who seeks powerful organizational improvements based on individual insight, creativity and innovation. Go ask a customer service clerk how to make things better.	2004-05-19

The lessons in this excellent book should be studied and applied by everyone who has to give presentations. In terms of audience connection and persuasive technique, Abe Lincoln must have known everything here (except, perhaps, the details of PowerPoint). And that's good, because you don't need anything new or fancy to give a great presentation, you just need a message and clear instructions on how to deliver it - so, here they are. The book is cleanly written with pop-out boxes, sample graphics and corporate examples. Anyone who ignores its powerful basic rules will fail at presenting. Failure means boring the audience and leaving them unconvinced and unwilling to hear more. This is your cure for those blues. The book's flaw is the author's tedious self-promotion, but he's a former TV guy, so what the heck do you expect? The bottom line, we attest, is that what he says, you need to know.	2004-05-19

Can Biblical content meet business objectives, much less give you clout? Well, yes, according to the authors. In fact, this is an effective balancing act, posing business objectives on one end of the seesaw and inspiration on the other. The content is simultaneously spiritual and businesslike - if a little misty on facts, such as a bit of fuzzy history in the pages that cover Aristotle's teachings. To their credit, when authors Stephen R. Graves and Thomas G. Addington get businesslike, they are good at it. They convey reliable instructions about influence, mentoring and clout echoed by other books on management and spirituality. They also make some original, if banal, inspirational observations. For example, their key point is that Jesus intended to influence people. Well, that's the point of ministry, isn't it? And of clout. The book's evangelical tone focuses on Christianity - as opposed to the general business impact of spirituality and mentoring - thus, we note that for those Christians who are trying to integrate their faith and their work effectively, this book could be a welcome guidepost.	2004-05-07

There is no difference of opinion about how successful salespeople become and remain successful. You can read long books, philosophical books and books filled with examples and inspiration. The rules are virtually the same. There are no secrets in Barry J. Farber's book, but there are lots of verities. It is a brief, repetitive and yet comprehensive compilation of the basics. You learn what you ought to do and then you get a check list that you can use to monitor your progress. This is a simple, short and fairly complete presentation for any new salesperson. It lacks a treatment of the preliminary closing techniques that are important in discretionary buys, but that is all that is missing. Because it is thorough and clear, recommend this handy manual to sales trainers and aspiring salespersons who want a tidy, well-organized presentation on fundamental sales strategies.	2004-05-07

If you have participated in negotiations before, you'll know how to decide what sections of the plentiful advice here apply to your needs. From the most basic and self-evident advice (get it in writing) to the psychological (stay friendly) to the more sophisticated (be aware of your opponent's culture), author Peter Wink tries to cover a variety of negotiating situations and tactics. His suggestions vary from hardball (turn up the heat and use uncomfortable chairs), which may be difficult to implement, to puffball (walk away smiling), depending on what your opponent throws at you. And if he sounds a little paranoid when describing negotiations that went wrong, take his experiences as a cautionary warning. If you need to do a better job of getting what you want, we recommend this useful guide. Much of its advice will be helpful and applicable - just think like a negotiator and chose wisely.	2004-05-07

If you have this book, you don't need to go back to school for a marketing degree to learn how to sell your consulting services. The single practitioner can use this basic text as a consultancy marketing bible. Elaine Biech's manual will help you increase your client base and retain the clients you have. It is free of jargon and packed with practical tools and ideas on how to market a consulting business. Using a workbook format, Biech provides task sheets in every chapter, along with probing questions you complete and apply to your work. If you miss one of her many excellent tips along the way, don't worry; you'll probably read it again in another chapter. That built-in redundancy may be a good teaching drill - especially for beginners - but the book could have been tighter. However, if you're a new, lone consultant (this is not for big consulting practices) targeting corporate clients, we encourage you to study this book - it will open your eyes and increase your business.	2004-05-07

John Crawley and Katherine Graham provide an excellent introduction to mediation for managers who are unfamiliar with this technique. The book may seem basic to experts, though its useful examples of mediation practices at work will help even experienced practitioners. This is a clearly written (complete with British vocabulary idiosyncrasies), well-organized resource for company owners, managers and supervisors, though they may need additional practice before applying these techniques. The authors describe the basic categories of conflict resolution methods, though they might have included the well-known Thomas-Kilmann categories of conflict resolution styles - an approach that also includes compromise. Otherwise, we feel no conflict at all in highly recommending this solid, hands-on book.	2004-05-07

Peg Pickering presents a standard, basic time and self management guide, which is particularly helpful for disorganized people. She teaches you how to organize your work and yourself. Many of the guidelines will be familiar and seem like plain common sense. However, she presents the material in a well-organized brass-tacks way, and her summaries at the end of each chapter are particularly useful highlights of the main points. She also includes a number of charts, forms and quizzes that provide helpful advice for organizing your life and work. Additionally, the book is formatted in a reader-friendly way, with boxes and frequent headlines and type-changes that make it easy to skip ahead to the topics that interest you most. We recommend this good solid guide, particularly for office workers, managers and business professionals.	2004-05-07

This book is built on the premise that a lot of companies have, metaphorically speaking, the head of a dead elephant sitting in their boardrooms. The dead elephant's head represents conflict, disagreement and rivalry between the executives themselves. No one wants to talk about the dead elephant's head, because no one wants to admit that it's there. Unfortunately, it's a big, ugly reality that must be addressed sooner or later, and everyone knows it. Author and consultant Howard M. Guttman maps out a process companies can use to deal more openly and honestly with internal conflicts. He begins with the premise that conflict isn't inherently bad and can even serve a productive purpose, if it's properly managed and conducted according to the rules. We strongly recommend this book to corporate executives - and to the worker bees who have to duck when those Goliaths in the corner offices start slinging rocks.	2004-05-06

If you've even glanced at your retirement account balance or brokerage statement in the past few years, you no doubt have felt the effects of the broadband bubble. Less publicized than the tech wreck of 2000, the broadband meltdown was every bit as costly. Journalist Om Malik gathers the varied tales of telecom shenanigans anddf then adds up the stock sales so you can see just how much the broadbandits took. Malik's engaging and vitriolic writing style is fun to read, and he makes the intriguing assertion that the telecoms outdid the dot-coms in terms of sheer greed and gall. We suggest this book to any investor who hopes not to get burned, and to any executive responsible for safeguarding shareholder value.	2004-05-06

This book is a must-read for anyone involved in mergers and acquisitions in the cable or media industries, a should read for people doing M&amp;A in other industries and a worthwhile read for anyone with an interest in business and investing. The author sat at the deal-making table with some of the best negotiators in the media and communications industries. His general advice about negotiating strategy and tactics is quite familiar, but he brings a unique insight into the motivations and manipulations of CEOs and investment bankers. Academics have long puzzled over why CEOs implement value-destroying M&amp;A deals. Here's a first-hand, eyewitness account of how these big deals come to be. Even if you have little faith in the astuteness of executives, the author's revelations will surprise you. Just when you thought nobody could be that stupid, here comes an anecdote about another boardroom leader who was. The detail, it must be said, gets exhaustive at times, but if you love deals, we think that you'll be too absorbed to care.	2004-05-06

Author Victor Newman sets out to demystify knowledge management, strip away the jargon and offer a clear, useful guide to integrating emotions and logic practically. His information is random, bouncy with unconnected - though interesting - anecdotes, mostly in the first person. The author didn't assemble his thoughts in a very orderly way, given that this is more of a notebook than a book, but he comes through with punchy, tight chapters and a rare sense of humor. Most writing about knowledge management is tedious and academic. This book aims to break that pattern. It's a collection of personal stories, because knowledge management is, after all, a personal enterprise. As a notebook, this publication has both utility and merit. Newman offers valid criticisms of current knowledge management practices, and suggests some modes of thought and some useful readings. Sequence isn't the priority here, content is. You will find nuggets of useful knowledge management lore and counsel. We recommend keeping the book handy and dipping in often for a helping hand. This notebook is like any other set of knowledge: you'll have to manage it a bit.	2004-05-06

Hedge funds burst into the headlines in the early 1990s, when George Soros became a household name - at least in Europe, where many people blamed him and his hedge fund for wrecking the European exchange rate mechanism. Similarly, a U.S. hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) began with an aura of investing invincibility, only to fail dramatically. Hedge fund investing is sometimes, but not always, high risk and high return. Once limited to a privileged elite group of investors, hedge funds are now opening their rosters to less sophisticated, less wealthy speculators. But hedge funds are not just like any other funds, and anyone contemplating an investment needs a solid, comprehensive guide, such as this book. Author Alexander M. Ineichen, neither a salesman nor an alarmist, pulls no punches when discussing the risks of hedge funds. He is quite straightforward about the sometimes astonishing success of some hedge fund managers, but careful to point out the common misconceptions about them. Without hedging our bets, we find this book a valuable addition to every investor's library.	2004-05-06

In more than 600 pages, author Peter Krass delivers an almost overwhelming volume of facts about Andrew Carnegie, who certainly merits detailed study. Much in his life and work remains relevant today. The book is marred by frequent editorial asides and judgments. However, a man emerges out of the mountain of facts who was unusually sensitive to the impact of new technologies and extraordinarily able to position himself to take advantage of them. Carnegie was a man of contrasts, ruthless, hypocritical, forceful and diffident, idealistic and amoral, driven to amass a fortune and philanthropic. We appreciate the effort behind this full scale biography of Carnegie, the first one offered for almost 30 years, and recommends getting to know this American icon.	2004-05-06

Lou Adler, president of the Power Hiring consulting and training company, provides a systematic approach for finding, interviewing and hiring the best candidate for a job. He emphasizes making an objective assessment and, to this end, he provides techniques for overcoming first impressions. He identifies four key interview questions you can use to determine job candidates' competency and motivation, and to match their skills and interests to your company's needs. The book includes charts and checklists that highlight important points. We recommend this well-organized guide to effective hiring to company owners, human resource personnel and managers involved in the hiring process. Alert job seekers may also find it useful to learn what a good interview will demand.	2004-05-06

This is a particularly important book for two types of people to read: those who believe economic instability and inequality will lead capitalism to implode (they're wrong); and those who believe the economic engine of capitalism is running just fine, especially in the United States, and simply needs to be left alone by meddling do-gooders, thank you (they are wrong too). Neither view is realistic. Lester C. Thurow is quite well suited to explain why. He is practically a brand name on national television, known for making more sense of the economy than anyone could possibly expect from a dean at MIT. Although Thurow wrote this book in 1996, the trade deficit, the skewed distribution of revenue and the disparity between rich and poor continue to demonstrate the validity of his conclusion that fewer and fewer can get more and more for only so long. We highly recommend his insightful analysis, wishing only that Thurow proposed deeper solutions for the problems he so ably diagnosed.	2004-05-06

In Insurance from Underwriting to Derivaties, Eric Briys and Francois de Varenne, both Deutsche Bank insurance experts, have written a highly technical, albeit readable, book for their professional peers. They discuss property-casualty insurance, risk, securitizing, pricing and liabilities duration in the United States and Europe. However, it will dawn on the casual reader fairly early that there should be an \\"experts only\\" label on the book jacket. Even the basic introduction to property-casualty insurance begins with the presentation of complex mathematical models. More daunting models, charts and graphs elucidate information throughout. Insiders will appreciate this data and the extensive footnotes and references. While this may not be a book for the mid-management reader, we assure you, without risk, that its target audience - financial executives and professionals in the insurance industry - will be very glad to have it.	2004-05-06

This book, exhaustively researched and daunting to read, sums up all of the most important forces likely to concern a biotech marketer. The authors take a dispassionate, methodical approach, buttress their points with plenty of case evidence and examples, clearly have a grasp of the subject and communicate detailed knowledge of great value to those in the field. Unfortunately, their style is plodding and clinical, replete with passive constructions and impersonal, generally soporific sentences. We believe that those with a real need to know will be glad to brew some strong coffee and grateful to stay the course and become so thoroughly updated. Readers who are intrigued by the field - but not immersed in it - will benefit most from reading the introduction, the first three chapters and the conclusion.	2004-05-06

Those who extrapolate trends and predict the future say that economic, political and even genetic factors will determine the future of the world. But, in fact, culture makes the world go around, according to Richard D. Lewis, a well-traveled scholar who reflects here on the origins and implications of human cultures. Culture has deep roots in history, religion and language, so it will probably be a more potent factor in shaping the future than many observers grant. Now it is fashionable to say that cultures are coalescing into one global culture. This author strenuously opposes that easy assumption. He also offers a deeper look at Islamic culture in a post-Sept. 11 addendum. Overall, his intriguing arguments might have been much more involving if a good editor had pared away some of his more facile references and observations. At times, the book seems to serve up a tad too many stereotypes and clich&eacute;s. We also find that it offers some fascinating, thought-provoking suggestions, and recommends it for a rainy weekend at the beach or for airplane reading.	2004-05-05

Fabozzi, a professor of finance, compiled Investment Management for Insurers, an extensive series of articles (including six they wrote) on managing investments. Various experts contributed the other two-dozen plus articles. The book, which is organized in sections based on major investment management topics, focuses first on general insurance issues, such as risk management and setting up a performance management system for insurers. Subsequent articles cover fixed income products, valuation, equity portfolio management and measuring and controlling interest rate risk. This highly technical book may not be sexy, but it is very sophisticated and fully accessorized with tables, charts, graphs, mathematical formulas and footnotes. Let's be clear: it's a book for pros, an in-depth compilation that we recommend to professional and academic specialists in insurance investment management.	2004-05-05

Some corporate cultures compel managers to \\"grade on the curve,\\" which means that even good employees may have to fail. Even in less draconian corporate cultures, performance appraisals require supervisors to tell people about their shortcomings, an uncomfortable exercise for both the appraiser and the appraised. Meanwhile, lurking in the not-too-distant background is the threat of litigation instigated by an employee whose appraiser lets slip an awkward reference to race, sex, age or some other legally proscribed subject. This book tells you how to avoid the stress and anxiety of appraisals by focusing on a few basics. Authors Sharon Armstrong and Madelyn Appelbaum provide valuable counsel - albeit not terribly well organized - for people on both sides of the desk, both the supervisor and the employee. We recommend the authors' useful potpourri of advice, role playing exercises, case histories, evaluation forms and observations about appraisals to everyone who participates in a performance appraisal system and certainly to anybody who runs one.	2004-05-01

This is an excellent and comprehensive introduction to PIPEs. The acronym stands for Private Investment in Public Equity, and this includes not only common stock but warrants and other permutations of equity. Companies often issue PIPEs when they need capital but when market conditions make it imprudent to raise funds through a public offering. Most PIPEs investors are sophisticated institutions, and hedge funds are probably the most active participants in the market. PIPEs are a high-risk investment with abundant legal, market, regulatory and other complexities. This book neither attempts to sell PIPEs nor to discourage people from buying them. While somewhat repetitive, it is reasonably objective and reasonably thorough. We strongly recommend it to professional investors.	2004-05-01

There's no denying the effectiveness of the Work-Out system at General Electric (GE). This book is a straightforward and comprehensive introduction to what Work-Oout means and how it helped GE achieve such astonishing results under Jack Welch, who introduced it. This clear, well-organized book makes it possible for any executive or manager to apply at least some elements of the work-out program in any organizational context. We do caution you, however, that the Work-Out program as portrayed here demands a great deal of commitment and moral fortitude from leaders. Empowerment may be effective, but it is rarely comfortable for the powers that be. Just ask \\"Neutron Jack.\\"	2004-05-01

This solidly researched, well-written book makes a sound case for an unconventional view of corporate entrepreneurship. Author Vijay Sathe contends that the archetype of the lonely, low-level corporate entrepreneur is a fantastic, fairy-tale critter. In fact, entrepreneurship and new business creation happen in big organizations only when corporate leadership fosters it through a mix of principles and policies. Sathe grounds his case in a detailed exposition of experiences at major corporations, and carefully considers the evidence before pronouncing any judgment. Unlike many authors of books on this subject, Sathe seems both intellectually honest and genuinely interested in nailing the truth, not in hawking a nostrum. If the book has any flaw, it is that the author takes more pains than necessary at points, and presents more detail than the reader needs. That is not a grievous fault, and we find it very easy to forgive.	2004-05-01

Motorola invented Six Sigma. This concise handbook promises to introduce readers to the history of Six Sigma, to explain Six Sigma's leadership requirements and to point the way for Six Sigma practitioners to go forward. It delivers admirably on these promises. Many Six Sigma books offer dense diagrams and mind-numbing descriptions of all of the minutiae that goes into the process improvement program. This book provides a broader perspective. It necessarily sacrifices much of the operational detail in order to present a good general introduction to the subject. This is not the book for managers who need a field-guide or an instruction manual to forge ahead with implementing a Six Sigma program. But for those who have heard of Six Sigma, wonder what it is about and want a good, basic, elementary explanation, we believe this book will serve nicely.	2004-05-01

Some of the challenges of managing global teams are obvious. For example, team members will probably speak different languages and come from different cultures. So how do you function in the Tower of Babel? Authors Michael J. Marquardt and Lisa Horvath recommend designating a common language, usually English for American companies. On the other hand, some of the challenges global team managers confront are not so obvious. For instance, what reward system do you use when everyone values different things? Can you just give everyone a pat on the back and a bonus, or must you individualize feedback mechanisms? What etiquette do you follow if everyone has a different sense of what is polite? If these issues haven't occurred to you already, you need this book. If they have, well, We still suggests this rundown on the very basics. As you may have guessed, all the issues you have already confronted with international employees get magnified with global teams.	2004-04-29

This book is a comprehensive, detailed collection of Larry Ellison anecdotes and quotes from people around him. Author Matthew Symonds occasionally interjects himself, but mostly lets his sources talk. Perhaps for fairness, he quotes many people who disagree with each other about important decisions at Oracle. Perhaps for journalistic objectivity, he generally refrains from judgment. This shows the reader every perspective, even if it doesn't define context, chronology or direction. You get all of the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, though you may want a clearer box top picture. Some of the technology coverage will intrigue only tech industry buffs, but overall you will learn a great deal of interesting information about Ellison and Oracle.<br />We also found that Ellison's character came most into focus when the book entered the world of yacht racing, his passion. The author also includes poignant, revealing anecdotes about Ellison's childhood and candid reports about his personal life. Larry Ellison was allowed to review the manuscript and his comments appear as counterbalancing footnotes on many pages. That guy, he always does things a new way - as you will see.	2004-04-29

As American markets have evolved, so has the consumer. The aging American consumer (40 and over), now the New Customer Majority, makes purchasing decisions based on values, a shift that traditional marketing has failed to accommodate. The result is consumer dissatisfaction, diminished brand loyalty and expensive, ineffective advertising. Authors David B. Wolfe and Robert E. Snyder argue that marketers should acknowledge the new demographics and use techniques from brain research, developmental psychology, sociology and demographics to reach aging consumers. While the authors selectively cite data and successful marketing campaigns, they also offer a sound narrative and a refreshing, common sense point of view. On the downside, they use extensive marketing jargon, perhaps because they are ad consultants promoting their expertise. Citing attitudinal studies and new behavioral and brain chemistry research, they explain that marketers must account for their consumers' \\"season of life\\" to develop effective campaigns. We recommend this book to corporate marketing, investor relations, human resources, customer service and product development departments. It might even bridge the generation gap.	2004-04-29

Richard Bak is a long-time resident of Detroit and Dearborn, Michigan, and doubtless absorbed much of the Ford legacy simply by growing up in a place that Ford formed. This book is not exactly a corporate history, not exactly a biography and not exactly a tell-all celebrity book, but it has elements of each. The most interesting pieces include the extended reminiscences by people who lived and worked closely with the Fords, and especially with Edsel's family. He has long lingered in the shadow of his famous father and it is somewhat surprising to discover that he had some fine qualities. These reminiscences have poignant moments that establish the veracity of any number of proverbs on money, happiness and the foibles of the great. The book is reasonably well written and fairly concise. It recapitulates the essentials of the Ford story, though it glances over the evolution of management and organization at the company. We assure you that you'll get the full Ford saga here, though you may have to extrapolate the business lessons it teaches for yourself.	2004-04-29

Its optimistic theme is that freedom is a better management principle than control. Instead of relying on real-life examples, which might be hard to come by, the authors present a fictitious scenario in which wise older counselors impart the wisdom of freedom to young but amenable auditors. With freedom, workplace antagonisms and conflicts no longer fester. Employees cast aside their suspicions, differences, distrusts and other fruits of oppressive control, cooperating gladly and willingly in an atmosphere of near-utopian productivity. The real reward isn't corporate Eden, but personal accountability, freely given by employees who innovate and work hard because they are trusted. We trust that you'll know just how much freedom to apply before you create chaos instead of conscientiousness.	2004-04-29

Author Howard Schilit writes in surprisingly plain English, and provides the reader with a toolkit to determine what's so rotten in Denmark - or on Wall Street. You don't have to be an experienced reader of financial reports to learn a lot from this book. Schilit offers more than theory; he provides specific examples and case studies. Learn about the manager who reduced future expenses by purchasing $12 million worth of advance postage metering at the end of the year. Find out how \\"Chainsaw Al\\" Dunlop drove up the price of Sunbeam stock by creating a $35 million reserve, all while laying off 11,000 employees. Learn the inside story of how Enron became the poster child for corporate wrongdoing. We highly recommends this book to independent investors, and anyone else who needs to understand how unethical execs cook the books. It may not save you from losing a bundle, but at least you won't feel like you're in a battle of wits and devoid of weaponry.	2004-04-29

This book is a thorough, practical guide to the nitty-gritty of venture capital investing. This comprehensive, well-organized instruction manual summarizes the homework you should do before you make a venture capital investment, the paperwork needed to carry out the investment and the ongoing work you will have to undertake to have a prayer of seeing your investment pay off. If it is a little plodding, you can understand why. It covers a lot of ground. The authors compare venture capital investing to a partnership at one point, to a marriage at another. They don't attempt to sell you on venture investing. In fact, by telling you how difficult and labor intensive it is, they may even drive you away. We believe this book definitely belongs in the library of anyone who has ever taken a serious interest in venture investing. It will also help entrepreneurs who need venture capital financing by showing them how to evaluate their companies according to the criteria that serious investors are apt to use.	2004-04-29

This book is a detailed and meticulous presentation of the calculations involved in Value at Risk (VaR) measurement. According to authors Pietro Penza and Vipul K. Bansal, Value at Risk is one of the most popular approaches to measuring the risk of harm to financial portfolios. It is a valuable institutional tool. Be aware, though, the book's message and how-to assistance will seem generally irrelevant to individual investors, except for a handful of extremely high net worth individuals at the top of the Forbes 400. Its calculations are beyond the ken of most non-mathematicians, but they will intrigue the right audience. We find this book to be a useful addition to the libraries of professional investors, bankers or risk managers, particularly those with highly developed analytical skills and a certain degree of comfort with financial engineering. Some other financial managers and lay readers will find useful information here, though they may need to walk on tiptoes through those sections of the content that are over their heads.	2004-04-29

It is really written for financial officers. In fact, at one point, author Tim Ambler actually recommends turning responsibility for marketing metrics over to the finance department. That emphasis on a hard-nosed, bottom line orientation is novel and refreshing. Ambler recognizes that one of the biggest problems marketers inflict on themselves is their failure to establish and demonstrate that money spent on marketing really does matter to the financial performance of a business. With comprehensive attention to detail, he is careful to present most of the current thinking on how to measure the value of investments in marketing. Unfortunately, his style is dense, so much of what he says may take non-experts several readings to clarify.We are grateful that his helpful executive summary goes some way toward mitigating this problem and highly recommends his comprehensive and informative material - however, an editor as ruthless as a CFO might benefit the book's own bottom line.	2004-04-29

The Wright brothers were an amazing team. Working part time, these two previously undistinguished bicycle dealers from Dayton, Ohio, solved a problem that had baffled, frustrated and defeated (sometimes fatally) some of the most well-educated, well-capitalized and well known scientific entrepreneurs of their and all prior time. The story of how and why they succeeded in creating and flying the first airplane is not only fascinating, but also rich in didactic value for parents, teachers and businesspeople. Author Mark Eppler does an admirable job of drawing you into the story of the Wright brothers. We relishe the problem-solving principles he defines, which are, at times, refreshingly unorthodox. He abstracts these principles well and phrases them clearly, but the best demonstration of the principles lies in his retelling of the Wright brothers' absorbing story. A very good book indeed.	2004-04-29

Author Ken Blanchard's literary franchise began with the stunningly successful The One Minute Manager. He has mastered the art of a certain type of book for supervisors and higher executives who need to learn more about management, values and leadership. These readers probably don't have a lot of time and they like to get right to the bottom line - Blanchard obliges. His book enjoys the blessing of brevity, and he takes an accessible, creative approach to demonstrating that effective management really matters, that it takes time to develop and that it is not the result of trendy theories or relentless bossy practices. Blanchard encapsulates his lessons in an bouncy parable about a contest between a company that uses a manufactured leadership pill to instill a pumped up results-only approach and a company that uses value-driven leadership based on integrity, partnership and affirmation. Although the medicine may be a bit basic, We recommend this dosage for students of the art of effective leadership. It's a spoonful of sugar.	2004-04-29

Author David F. D?Alessandro is a marketing guru, and a skilled phrase maker and spin doctor. To his own surprise, he was offered a chair at the management table where the bottom line decisions get made on his way to becoming CEO of John Hancock Financial Services. In the framework of rules for personal branding and in the interest helping you play office politics successfully, D?Alessandro spins dozens of yarns that bring context and reality to a subject that is often speculated about by authors who have never really achieved the success their books describe. His advice is ruthlessly honest, pointed, witty, precise and ripe with polished anecdotes. For this reason we recommend this book to business persons anywhere on the corporate ladder who suspect their battle plan may be ready for a few new moves.	2004-04-29

Authors Barbara Wheat, Chuck Mills and Mike Carnell use the format of a novel to explain two major quality control mechanisms: Lean Enterprise and Six Sigma, the efficiency approach that has had a broad impact on corporate America. In a sort of parable that shows both of these processes in action, they tell the story of a consultant named Samantha. She helps a business owner named Sid who has made all the wrong choices in setting up his manufacturing operation. Sam uses Six Sigma to help Sid out of his quagmire. The volume goes into greater, more useful detail about identifying and eliminating areas of waste than many other Six Sigma books. The text links the Five S's of Lean Enterprise with the systems problem-solving methodology MAIC (measure, analyze, improve and control). In all, here are the basics of Six Sigma and Lean Enterprise in an easy-to-use volume you can read on a commuter flight. We strongly recommend this book to those who want to begin to improve their firms' efficiency and productivity.	2004-04-29

In 1971, President Richard Nixon ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold and thereby scotched the mechanism of international agreements and regulations that had governed the world monetary system since the end of World War II. Over the ensuing decades, the once-stable global monetary environment became an exciting, volatile new source of risk and opportunity. Manufacturers saw their fortunes rise and fall as currency shifts favored them or, alternatively, their competitors overseas. Financial institutions discovered new opportunities and dangers in fast-moving currency markets. We recommend this book for its detailed and generally clear, albeit often tedious, introduction to the tools, techniques and strategies readers may use to manage risk or speculate in the world's biggest financial arena - the unregulated international currency market.	2004-04-29

The debate on gender equity often emphasizes that women earn less than men with similar experience. Authors Linda Babcock and Sara Laschever say that while women may indeed be the victims of external forces, they also to some extent may suffer from their own inability, unwillingness or aversion to negotiate or make demands. In fact, men negotiate four times as frequently as women, and get better results. Men are much more apt to make demands and ask for benefits, pay increases and so forth. Men make more money not necessarily because the system is overtly discriminatory - though it well may be - but because men demand more. The book tends to belabor its point, and sometimes the evidence does not seem as well-presented as it might have been, but we find that it sheds useful light on a knotty social problem. Perhaps it will spur more women to fight - or to continue to fight - on their own behalf.	2004-04-29

Salespeople can't do the job alone. A complicated, corporate sale may require the involvement of a team: engineers, researchers, financial experts and salespeople - after all, you are trying to build the level of trust necessary to win and keep a major customer. Many companies fail to adopt the right policies and procedures to form and maintain effective selling teams. They seem to leave it to the folks involved to figure out whether, why, when and how they should work together. Reliance on the spontaneous emergence of teamwork may be a typical approach, but it is hardly the most effective. In fact, managing sales teams is multi-faceted and challenging. The stakes are always high - failure will cost real money - and the personalities that have to come together are often incompatible. We recommend the detailed, practical framework this books offers for creating and leading sales teams. It is straightforward and down to earth. While it does not break startling new ground, it does assemble in one convenient package most of the tried-and-true principles and practices of team selling.	2004-04-29

This lucid, plain, straightforward book is not necessarily the sort of thing one expects from an economist, yet author Stanley Fischer is one of our era's greatest economists. His work at the International Monetary Fund put him on the front lines during some of the twentieth century's most serious economic crises and panics. He has a unique and valuable perspective. His timely discussion of the IMF and the World Bank provides a sobering antidote to the rhetoric of both globalization and anti-globalization. Fischer reminds us that the IMF's many glaring failures and imperfections are the stumbles and flaws of an organization that has done good work to further a noble purpose. It also has proven willing and able to change when the facts do. For good reason, Fischer's essays sometimes read like the arguments of a defense attorney countering prosecutorial accusations. The IMF has come in for so much criticism in recent years that it is refreshing to discover so many points in its favor, and we find it both fair and prudent to consider them carefully.	2004-04-23

The dollar, euro and yen dominate the global monetary order, with the dollar now unrivaled at the top and unlikely to be threatened in the future. The countries that issue lesser currencies face a trade-off between monetary sovereignty and international acceptability (with all its economic advantages). Some economists say these lesser currencies should simply dollarize, that is, sacrifice their monetary sovereignty on the altar of international economic efficiency by adopting a stronger currency as their own. Author Benjamin J. Cohen argues that these countries are likely to reject dollarization because the emotional and political advantages of issuing one's own currency are simply too strong. He suggests various alternate mechanisms that allow countries to maintain some monetary independence and authority while gaining the advantages of a fully liquid, widely used currency. Non-specialists may find his extensive discussions a bit dry or sometimes tedious, but we applaud the author's ability to explore monetary economics in admirably lucid detail.	2004-04-23

Here's a two-ingredient recipe for disaster: take a big organization and mix in ambitious plans for a state-of-the-art software system. The disaster already happened at the IRS and Denver International Airport, both victims of software development missteps. Such failures are common, costly and all-too-avoidable, writes academic Kweku Ewusi-Mensah. While his prose can be dry, the examples he uses prove quite juicy. A little common sense could have saved the IRS billions and the Denver airport millions. Both fell victim to surprisingly basic pitfalls, such as unclear or unrealistic goals and over optimistic expectations that inexperienced people could get the job done. Ewusi-Mensah convincingly argues that organizations need to share such learning experiences, although he acknowledges that would mark a reversal from common practice. We recommend this book to managers and engineers involved in developing software. This cautionary tale could save your neck.	2004-04-23

This guide book on achieving personal branding, or what used to be called name recognition, may be focused toward financial advisors and other types of consultants, but it contains useful guidance for any professional who needs to be remembered by potential clients and customers. Author Peter Montoya, who wrote this with Tim Vandehey, believes that everyone has a personal brand, that some people manage their brands and that to manage your brand effectively you have to be serious, deliberate and methodical. The book provides a step-by-step program supported with sound analysis and clear common sense to help anyone succeed in building a strong personal brand for career growth. We find that there is something in this metaphorical image-building manual for everyone. Even those who may find it a bit off-putting to objectify themselves like soap or some other commodity could benefit from these solid tips on individual image building. After all, people who affect your career are going to form opinions of you anyway - you might as well control those opinions as much as you can.	2004-04-23

Gary Zukav and Linda Francis contend, perhaps reasonably, that a decision and an opportunity confront you every instant. You can choose to remain bogged down in a rut of habit and fear, or to break loose and create a boundless new future. This book - the newest in their \\"Seat of the Soul\\" series, which the authors seem to assume you have read - urges you to liberate yourself from the burden of the past, which they maintain really need be no burden. Fear not, hate not, resent not. Instead, chose harmonious cooperation, love, freedom, reverence and peace, choices that lead to true happiness. The authors maintain that you truly are free to choose, and exhort you to take responsibility for your choices. Abundant hypothetical examples, personal anecdotes and exercises provide the intellectual foundation, such as it is, for their New Age-flavored advice. We choose to believe that people who appreciate confident self-help counsel will find much here to savor. Skeptics, who may find that so many upbeat pronouncements give them the jitters, have made alternate choices and need not apply.	2004-04-22

Few companies got more marketing mileage out of their culture than Medtronic. Its former CEO, author Bill George, is proud of his company's squeaky clean corporate record. Despite all the clich&eacute;s he may muster, despite his occasional preachiness, perhaps no CEO has written a more lucid or insightful series of reflections on the challenge of managing a corporation in twentieth century America. Read this book and you will learn some obvious lessons and some new ones: that leaders should be honest, that they will be tempted to cut corners in pursuit of short term profits but really ought to resist that temptation, that devotion to customers is at least as important as devotion to shareholders (provided you make your numbers every quarter) and that managers at Enron and WorldCom did the wrong thing, but we can learn a lesson from them. We acknowledge that Bill George may be as close as American executive ranks have come to producing a moral philosopher.	2004-04-22

This slim volume, which draws life and business lessons from the game of chess, is one of the better self-help and self-improvement books you're likely to pick up. At only 115 pages, double-spaced, and a mere 20,000 words, the entire book is about the length of a chapter in most other books in its category. Author Bruce Pandolfini includes just enough chess lore to keep the book relevant to chess, but not so much as to overwhelm a chess-averse reader. He writes concisely, as a chess player plays, with a great deal of concentration and quick, quiet decisions expressed in single sentences. The book offers several fine aphorisms, the sort you will remember long after you have put it down. But it's not the kind of book you will want to put down. Fortunately, we are glad to note, it is small enough to fit into a purse or computer bag along with everything else you carry.	2004-04-22

This is an excellent handbook for salespeople in search of a simple summary of the principles of selling complex and costly products and services in a difficult environment. Author Rick Page offers nothing startlingly new, but he does a good job of collecting and presenting the most noteworthy points from collective conventional wisdom about selling. He illustrates these points with amusing, memorable anecdotes. His book is well written, well organized and quite readable. He probably has a point or two to offer even the most experienced and successful salesperson. We note that chapter six summarizes the meat of the book in just three pages, so - until you have time to read the book - time-pressed salespeople could start by glancing at this section to begin to learn what really matters most in a complicated sales effort.	2004-04-22

Purchasing is a critically important business function, although it lacks the glamour and excitement of, say, finance or sales. In the past, purchasing employees have often been little more than glorified clerks mired in price comparisons. Sometimes, their responsibilities included accompanying vendors to ballgames and such, activities that helped keep the purchasing pro's mind off the fact that not many CEOs seemed to come up through the purchasing department. That may already be changing. Indeed, purchasing is now a career hot spot. Several trends - such as corporate demands for cost cutting and outsourcing, new electronic markets and auctions, globalization of customers and vendors, sharper supply-chain logistics technology, and the movement to create partnerships with suppliers - make purchasing substantially more important than ever before. Author Larry Paquette offers a short, lucid, quite readable summary of the essentials of purchasing in that light.  We find it an excellent, comprehensive and useful overview of sourcing.	2004-04-22

The preponderance of research for the past 100 years or so has demonstrated convincingly that stock markets are pretty efficient and that stock prices move randomly, or almost randomly. That is a strong argument against trying to time the market. Author Leslie N. Masonson disagrees, contending that if you use a few simple techniques to time the market, you can avoid losses and wind up with a more profitable portfolio than if you simply bought a representative selection of stocks and held them, as most financial advisors now recommend. He could have presented more evidence to support his opinion, but he is honest enough to contrast his point of view with the many arguments against attempting to time the market. He acknowledges that timing requires certain staunch character traits that are far from universally present in the investing populace. That is to his credit. Also to his credit, according to us, is the fact that he usefully defines and discusses a number of trading techniques and information sources that even non-investors should know about and that investors should understand.	2004-04-22

Author Jonathan Story has assembled in one relatively short book a dense collection of facts, hypotheses and perspectives on China. Unlike many writers who have fixed ideas about China and use their books to promote their ideas, Story gives full and fair time to competing viewpoints. He is not selling a hypothesis, but exploring possibilities. Readers who prefer easy and definitive answers may feel frustrated, because Story provides only difficult and ambiguous alternatives. Yet his approach is solid, and more accurate than a finite stance could be. The future of anything is uncertain, and China is egregiously inscrutable, so any honest pronouncement on China's future must acknowledge uncertainty, difficulty and ambiguity. If the book has a demerit, it is that the author sometimes offers interesting, but meandering digressions through the minutiae of Chinese chronology without fully explaining why the details matter. China is perplexing, so we welcome this compilation of insight - we would have been glad to read even more.	2004-04-22

Prioritizing the building blocks of life - family, work, money and time - is paramount to happiness. Some people do it unconsciously by living within their intellectual and monetary expectations. Others need a framework for balance, such as the one that authors A. Roger Merrill and Rebecca R. Merrill provide. To achieve personal balance, the authors suggest becoming a better team player, working more effectively, learning about finances and setting home and work priorities. They establish the goal of building a strong family, centered around parental \\"family leadership.\\" Do they successfully address the knotty issues they raise? Yes, in a folksy way. This is a useful self-help manual with checklists, self-assessments and personal anecdotes, which are sometimes touching, but sometimes impractical or saccharine. Though the management advice dons motivational language, the sections on family and work are particularly worthwhile. The authors deliver a solid antidote to misplaced modern values, albeit wrapped in some fluffy trappings. We recommend this book to corporate officers and human resource personnel, as well as to individuals seeking balance.	2004-04-22

Any CEO would love to run a company that is regarded as truly in a class by itself. After all that's about as close to a monopoly as you can get without running afoul of the regulators. Some companies - such as Starbucks, Volkswagen, Southwest Airlines and Apple Computers - do come close to being in a class by themselves. Here, consultant and author Joe Calloway suggests that all \\"Category of One\\" companies share a common trait that explains how they achieved success. More than just a book of theory, this volume also offers practical case studies, information and interviews. Strong on concepts, it needs to provide a bit more guidance about how to push your company into its own category.

They clearly reveal not only the differences between Chinese culture and the Western culture, but the origin of many of those differences. They explain both history and culture as a context for contemporary social standards, from practical etiquette to how to conduct yourself on a daily basis as you travel, live or work in China. The authors accomplish their explanatory goals, avoid silly generalities and give the visitor just enough knowledge to avoid being completely humiliated. When you read this, you'll have a framework for determining what else you need to learn before you go. Meanwhile we highly recommends this very readable, consistently interesting book.	2004-04-22

The authors touch on almost every dimension of the topic, including financial risk, operational risk, reputation risk, governance risk and even the risk of terrorist attack. The book might have been quite a bit shorter and somewhat more focused on corporate management if the authors, KPMG vice chairs Mary Pat McCarthy and Timothy P. Flynn had tightened their anecdotes about anti-terrorist preparations at the Olympic Games. However, they seem to have believed that they would lose readers unless they provided a few entertaining distractions, and they could be right. Though it breaks little new ground, it plows the old ground interestingly. We recommend this portable summary of useful information to the CEOs and board members who are its intended audience, as well as to anyone responsible for risk management.	2004-04-21

Do you feel that your employees just don't grapple with the tasks at hand? Take heart. This handbook offers one way to solve one of the major conundrums of modern management: how do we get things done? Authors Robert E. Lefton and Jerome T. Loeb focus on a productivity-oriented Task Management Model that requires managers to categorize employees along a spectrum of capabilities, including which jobs they like best and do well. Then, the model helps managers understand their own leadership styles and assign the right tasks to the right people to increase efficiency. The book cites examples of its model in use, but it is short on analysis, insights and detailed cases. However, .We  think it would be useful to managers and human resources professionals in large organizations who need a quick way to categorize staff members in hopes of improving productivity.	2004-04-21

This excellent, short, clear book should be part of everyone's reference library, particularly those who wish to understand standard conservative economic thought. The distinctions author Thomas Sowell draws between political and economic logic should become a valuable part of each voter's mental apparatus. Writing to educate the general reader, not to further instruct the sophisticated economist, the author advocates minimal government interference. He calls for as little regulation as possible, mainly because regulations have unintended and usually undesirable economic consequences when seen with a long-range perspective. Sowell's concise, easy-to-read style cuts through the jargon of most economic discussions to lay bare the underlying, plain heartwood. It is easy to quibble here and there. Sowell doesn't offer lots of statistics and back-up material. And, he seems to argue against individual economic decision making when he tilts a drug pricing discussion into a sermon against Americans buying medicine at low Canadian prices. However, we find that his book stands on its merits nonetheless, as long as you understand that the author has a political - as well as an economic - point of view.	2004-04-21

The recipe for success isn't so tough to figure out, writes financial entrepreneur Charles Patrick Garcia. Start with a heaping helping of passion, then mix in equal parts hard work, integrity, belief and positive attitude. The quality of the final dish resides in the details, of course, so the former military intelligence officer outlines the actions you must take to succeed and the mindset you need to adopt. Garcia's easily digested writing style, peppered with plenty of real-world examples from the military, politics and business, makes this motivational book a rewarding repast. We suggests Garcia's success manual to managers looking for a refresher course in staying focused, inspired and on task.	2004-04-21

The reputations of several major corporations (Enron, WorldCom, Parmalat and Tyco, to name a few) recently suffered from allegations of fraud, self-dealing, insider trading, accounting shenanigans and various other misdeeds. The sense of scandal became so pervasive that some businesspeople felt ashamed of their profession. Now, the mere rumor of misconduct is sufficient to send a company's stock price down. Ironically, in an era when the transnational corporations seem omnipotent in their globe-girdling might, many of them greatly resemble nubile maidens in an eighteenth century romance, their whole fate dependent on spotless and easily marred reputations. That being the case, every business and every business manager should prioritize the careful husbanding of reputation. We find that this book, which has been highly praised by some of the most estimable authorities on business ethics and management, offers a comprehensive, if sometimes pedantic, guide to every step of building, measuring, preserving and growing reputation capital.	2004-04-21

Traditionally, human resources departments and organizations have existed to fill jobs and manage the people who do jobs. Authors David D. Dubois and William J. Rothwell suggest a different approach: recruiting and managing competencies instead. The distinction is important, the authors say, because thinking of an organization as an aggregation of jobs makes it difficult to change quickly in response to new opportunities and threats. Much of what the authors suggest is plausible; some of it is even persuasive. On the other hand, their guide is as much an academic text as a manual for corporate use. Multiple references to other sources and dense definitions impede the clear path to practical, actionable advice. In that quest, the reader is grateful for the authors' useful planning tools, checklists, worksheets and other task-related aids, which compensate for the jargon and repetition. While wishing for a slightly less academic approach, We recommend this innovative take on human resources management to those staying abreast of changes in the field.	2004-04-21

Best known for his \\"Knock `Em Dead\\" series of books directed at job seekers, author Martin John Yate (co-writing here with Peter J. Sander) now turns to what happens after the seeker finds a job, does it well and gets promoted to management. He offers the know-how you need for that first management assignment: how to deal with subordinates, how to handle management duties when your subordinates are downsized away, how to create and lead teams, recruit a staff and so on. Yate goes a bit heavy on recruitment information, perhaps because he focused on that area previously. The book is directed at novice managers; anyone with business experience would find it simplistic. Though not novel, it is a useful, reasonably comprehensive collection of the principles that tend to be heavily discussed in business schools, management seminars and motivational meetings. That's not a bad thing, when you think about it. While this may not vault you up to the next rung on the career ladder, we note that it will be a useful addition to your basic bookshelf - if you want to get out of that cubicle and into an office with room for a bookshelf.	2004-04-21

This book is an intellectual tour de force. The breadth of the authors' accomplishment is impressive, drawing on sources from Emerson to Einstein to Freud to Adam Smith and more. Whether their analysis is correct, however, is highly debatable. One could build a small mountain out of books that have declared prematurely that the American economic miracle is over. This volume draws heavily on the Japanese model to predict continued economic doldrums in the U.S., and the comparison seems a poor fit. Its over-reliance on a continental historical perspective - Americans are naïve, overly optimistic fools whose prosperity is the result of dumb luck - seems fairly dubious. None of that takes away from the authors' keen perspective. Right or wrong, they bring intellectual light to the question, `Just what is going on with the American economy?' Because of this volume's range and insight, we very strongly recommends it, especially to those seeking historical and cross-cultural context for alternative views about the U.S. economy.	2004-04-21

Anthony Kelly's book will help you take a step back from the day-to-day fray, and be more strategic in your approach to solving problems. He explains that during conflicts, people operate in their own perceived best interests. Sometimes, combatants can find a common ground, but sometimes the conflict is a \\"zero-sum game,\\" with a winner and a loser. To come out on top as a player or manager, take advantage of the approaches and concepts of game theory. A word of caution, this volume relies heavily on formulas and decision-trees that may be beyond the ready grasp of non-technically minded managers. For those who want to put emotion aside and think strategically, however, reading this book is a rational move. We recommend it to those with mathematical or analytical skills, and finds that it will prove useful even to non-analysts who want to learn the fundamental concepts of game theory.	2004-04-21

What can you say about a book as long-awaited as Hillary Rodham Clinton's autobiography, except \\"read it\\"? No matter what your political persuasion, you will find something to chew over in this memoir. Clinton fans will love Hillary's spirited defense of her husband and her refusal to back down from her claim that a conservative conspiracy was gunning for him during his entire presidency. Conservatives will eagerly sift through her recollections of the Whitewater investigation for slips, omissions and excuses. Mrs. Clinton says her book should be viewed as a collection of her feelings and memories, rather than as a definitive account of the Clinton presidency. More than a simple memoir, this is a fascinating self-portrait of a woman who carved out a successful career in what was formerly a man's profession and became one of the most adored and simultaneously most reviled First Ladies in American history.We say: Read it.	2004-04-21

But don't hyperventilate just yet. If you calmly analyze the desirability and vulnerability of your secrets, you can figure out how to protect yourself. McNamara's prose is surprisingly clear given the degree of difficulty of his topic, and he offers a number of useful sidebars, charts and examples from inside the tech business to juice up his instructional tome.

Few companies got more marketing mileage out of their culture than Medtronic. Its former CEO, author Bill George, is proud of his company's squeaky clean corporate record. Despite all the clichs he may muster, despite his occasional preachiness, perhaps no CEO has written a more lucid or insightful series of reflections on the challenge of managing a corporation in twentieth century America. Read this book and you will learn some obvious lessons and some new ones: that leaders should be honest, that they will be tempted to cut corners in pursuit of short term profits but really ought to resist that temptation, that devotion to customers is at least as important as devotion to shareholders (provided you make your numbers every quarter) and that managers at Enron and WorldCom did the wrong thing, but we can learn a lesson from them. We acknowledge that Bill George may be as close as American executive ranks have come to producing a moral philosopher.	2004-03-10

Gary Zukav and Linda Francis contend, perhaps reasonably, that a decision and an opportunity confront you every instant. You can choose to remain bogged down in a rut of habit and fear, or to break loose and create a boundless new future. This book - the newest in their \\"Seat of the Soul\\" series, which the authors seem to assume you have read - urges you to liberate yourself from the burden of the past, which they maintain really need be no burden. Fear not, hate not, resent not. Instead, chose harmonious cooperation, love, freedom, reverence and peace, choices that lead to true happiness. The authors maintain that you truly are free to choose, and exhort you to take responsibility for your choices. Abundant hypothetical examples, personal anecdotes and exercises provide the intellectual foundation, such as it is, for their New Age-flavored advice. We choose to believe that people who appreciate confident self-help counsel will find much here to savor. Skeptics, who may find that so many upbeat pronouncements give them the jitters, have made alternate choices and need not apply.	2004-03-10

Such failures are common, costly and all-too-avoidable, writes academic Kweku Ewusi-Mensah. While his prose can be dry, the examples he uses prove quite juicy. A little common sense could have saved the IRS billions and the Denver airport millions. Both fell victim to surprisingly basic pitfalls, such as unclear or unrealistic goals and over optimistic expectations that inexperienced people could get the job done. Ewusi-Mensah convincingly argues that organizations need to share such learning experiences, although he acknowledges that would mark a reversal from common practice. We recommend this book to managers and engineers involved in developing software. This cautionary tale could save your neck.	2004-03-08

The dollar, euro and yen dominate the global monetary order, with the dollar now unrivaled at the top and unlikely to be threatened in the future. The countries that issue lesser currencies face a trade-off between monetary sovereignty and international acceptability (with all its economic advantages). Some economists say these lesser currencies should simply dollarize, that is, sacrifice their monetary sovereignty on the altar of international economic efficiency by adopting a stronger currency as their own. Author Benjamin J. Cohen argues that these countries are likely to reject dollarization because the emotional and political advantages of issuing one's own currency are simply too strong. He suggests various alternate mechanisms that allow countries to maintain some monetary independence and authority while gaining the advantages of a fully liquid, widely used currency. Non-specialists may find his extensive discussions a bit dry or sometimes tedious, but we applaud the author's ability to explore monetary economics in admirably lucid detail.	2004-03-08

Richard Bak is a long-time resident of Detroit and Dearborn, Michigan, and doubtless absorbed much of the Ford legacy simply by growing up in a place that Ford formed. This book is not exactly a corporate history, not exactly a biography and not exactly a tell-all celebrity book, but it has elements of each. The most interesting pieces include the extended reminiscences by people who lived and worked closely with the Fords, and especially with Edsel's family. He has long lingered in the shadow of his famous father and it is somewhat surprising to discover that he had some fine qualities. These reminiscences have poignant moments that establish the veracity of any number of proverbs on money, happiness and the foibles of the great. The book is reasonably well written and fairly concise. It recapitulates the essentials of the Ford story, though it glances over the evolution of management and organization at the company. We assure you that you'll get the full Ford saga here, though you may have to extrapolate the business lessons it teaches for yourself.	2004-03-08

This book is a thorough, practical guide to the nitty-gritty of venture capital investing. This comprehensive, well-organized instruction manual summarizes the homework you should do before you make a venture capital investment, the paperwork needed to carry out the investment and the ongoing work you will have to undertake to have a prayer of seeing your investment pay off. If it is a little plodding, you can understand why. It covers a lot of ground. The authors compare venture capital investing to a partnership at one point, to a marriage at another. They don't attempt to sell you on venture investing. In fact, by telling you how difficult and labor intensive it is, they may even drive you away. We believe this book definitely belongs in the library of anyone who has ever taken a serious interest in venture investing. It will also help entrepreneurs who need venture capital financing by showing them how to evaluate their companies according to the criteria that serious investors are apt to use.	2004-03-08

This book is a detailed and meticulous presentation of the calculations involved in Value at Risk (VaR) measurement. According to authors Pietro Penza and Vipul K. Bansal, Value at Risk is one of the most popular approaches to measuring the risk of harm to financial portfolios. It is a valuable institutional tool. Be aware, though, the book's message and how-to assistance will seem generally irrelevant to individual investors, except for a handful of extremely high net worth individuals at the top of the Forbes 400. Its calculations are beyond the ken of most non-mathematicians, but they will intrigue the right audience. We find this book to be a useful addition to the libraries of professional investors, bankers or risk managers, particularly those with highly developed analytical skills and a certain degree of comfort with financial engineering. Some other financial managers and lay readers will find useful information here, though they may need to walk on tiptoes through those sections of the content that are over their heads.	2004-03-08

It is really written for financial officers. In fact, at one point, author Tim Ambler actually recommends turning responsibility for marketing metrics over to the finance department. That emphasis on a hard-nosed, bottom line orientation is novel and refreshing. Ambler recognizes that one of the biggest problems marketers inflict on themselves is their failure to establish and demonstrate that money spent on marketing really does matter to the financial performance of a business. With comprehensive attention to detail, he is careful to present most of the current thinking on how to measure the value of investments in marketing. Unfortunately, his style is dense, so much of what he says may take non-experts several readings to clarify. We are grateful that his helpful executive summary goes some way toward mitigating this problem and highly recommends his comprehensive and informative material - however, an editor as ruthless as a CFO might benefit the book's own bottom line.	2004-03-08

This guide book on achieving personal branding, or what used to be called name recognition, may be focused toward financial advisors and other types of consultants, but it contains useful guidance for any professional who needs to be remembered by potential clients and customers. Author Peter Montoya, who wrote this with Tim Vandehey, believes that everyone has a personal brand, that some people manage their brands and that to manage your brand effectively you have to be serious, deliberate and methodical. The book provides a step-by-step program supported with sound analysis and clear common sense to help anyone succeed in building a strong personal brand for career growth. We find that there is something in this metaphorical image-building manual for everyone. Even those who may find it a bit off-putting to objectify themselves like soap or some other commodity could benefit from these solid tips on individual image building. After all, people who affect your career are going to form opinions of you anyway - you might as well control those opinions as much as you can.	2004-03-08

This lucid, plain, straightforward book is not necessarily the sort of thing one expects from an economist, yet author Stanley Fischer is one of our era's greatest economists. His work at the International Monetary Fund put him on the front lines during some of the twentieth century's most serious economic crises and panics. He has a unique and valuable perspective. His timely discussion of the IMF and the World Bank provides a sobering antidote to the rhetoric of both globalization and anti-globalization. Fischer reminds us that the IMF's many glaring failures and imperfections are the stumbles and flaws of an organization that has done good work to further a noble purpose. It also has proven willing and able to change when the facts do. For good reason, Fischer's essays sometimes read like the arguments of a defense attorney countering prosecutorial accusations. The IMF has come in for so much criticism in recent years that it is refreshing to discover so many points in its favor, and we find it both fair and prudent to consider them carefully.	2004-03-08

Author Ken Blanchard's literary franchise began with the stunningly successful The One Minute Manager. He has mastered the art of a certain type of book for supervisors and higher executives who need to learn more about management, values and leadership. These readers probably don't have a lot of time and they like to get right to the bottom line - Blanchard obliges. His book enjoys the blessing of brevity, and he takes an accessible, creative approach to demonstrating that effective management really matters, that it takes time to develop and that it is not the result of trendy theories or relentless bossy practices. Blanchard encapsulates his lessons in an bouncy parable about a contest between a company that uses a manufactured leadership pill to instill a pumped up results-only approach and a company that uses value-driven leadership based on integrity, partnership and affirmation. Although the medicine may be a bit basic, we recommend this dosage for students of the art of effective leadership. It's a spoonful of sugar.	2004-03-08

This basic, solid book on global business takes nothing for granted. Author Ernest Gundling teaches by example and illustration, and has something approaching a horror of direct statement. At the end of each chapter, where a bolder writer might insert points to remember, he provides, instead, lists of questions to consider. This book will tell you the skills you need and will make you very aware of your deficits, but it will not tell you precisely how to develop those skills. Gundling does provide a wealth of little, fictitious anecdotes about people who have done the right or wrong thing in global business. In a refreshingly humble approach, he sometimes uses his own blunders as examples of what not to do. We recommend his book, which brings to mind that Socrates was judged the wisest of men because he knew he knew nothing. Readers will come a few steps closer to such Socratic enlightenment. What you may not know about conducting yourself in international business would fill a book - this one.	2004-03-01

Organizations need leaders, but natural leaders are at least as rare as natural athletes. And, even natural athletes need careful training and development - given that almost everyone is capable of developing some degree of athletic potential. Similarly, the right training and development program can help almost anyone cultivate some degree of leadership potential. In fact, it can help a few people develop extraordinary leadership abilities. Ignoring leadership development is foolish, but at many companies, short-term priorities eclipse the long-term thinking needed to develop a good leadership pipeline. This book's plain, sensible approach is simple without being simplistic. It is generally lucid and clear, and - somewhat to our surprise - it does not suffer from having three authors. If you are a leader or need to develop leaders for large corporations, this is a very useful volume.	2004-03-01

Famed Watergate reporter Bob Woodward's \\"fly on the wall\\" story relies on detailed accounts from excellent sources who were in the room when key decisions were made. This exposition lives up to his reputation, and even promotes it to another level - if there is one. He takes us inside the White House bunker, Camp David and the halls of political power. Sometimes you'll think you're reading yesterday's headlines, but the story is more interesting when Woodward tells it. His narrative line is strong and you never feel that he is pandering to an action-film audience. This volume's most important contribution is its colorful portrayal of the key decision makers and its insight into how things really worked in Washington at the nation's most critical moment. We highly recommends this book to anyone yearning for a deeper insight about the World Trade Center attacks and their continuing aftermath.	2004-03-01

Christina Maslach and Michael P. Leiter's groundbreaking book debunks myths about burnout and holds organizations accountable for this epidemic, which has swept the work world. The authors detail how organizations can treat and prevent burnout, and take a critical look at its deep-rooted causes, including lack of engagement and conflict between employees' values and their jobs. Conversationally and with great impact, the authors support their points and suggestions. We recommend this book to executives, managers and employees. Now go home and get some rest.	2004-03-01

Author David Allen lists 52 basic principles for productivity, including: write everything down, do the jobs that nag you, focus on the matter at hand and so on. As he notes, the principles are both simple to understand and difficult to implement. The book is essentially a collection of gleanings from the author's previous writings, so it does not present a systematic or unified approach to time and productivity management. However, Allen's straightforward tips are handy, if sometimes duplicative. The number 52 suggests that you might find one helpful tip to use each week in a one-year program of self-improvement and productivity management. In that case, repetition is probably a good thing, since bad habits tend to spring up again like weeds and require the same remedies often. The author is relentlessly upbeat, optimistic and witty, like a motivational speaker. That might be hard to read in a big chunk, but it is easy to digest if you spend a little time every week reading a recommendation and implementing it. We recommend this book to anyone who urgently needs help with time management and productivity.	2004-03-01

Author Matthew Symonds occasionally interjects himself, but mostly lets his sources talk. Perhaps for fairness, he quotes many people who disagree with each other about important decisions at Oracle. Perhaps for journalistic objectivity, he generally refrains from judgment. This shows the reader every perspective, even if it doesn't define context, chronology or direction. You get all of the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, though you may want a clearer box top picture. Some of the technology coverage will intrigue only tech industry buffs, but overall you will learn a great deal of interesting information about Ellison and Oracle. We also found that Ellison's character came most into focus when the book entered the world of yacht racing, his passion. The author also includes poignant, revealing anecdotes about Ellison's childhood and candid reports about his personal life. Larry Ellison was allowed to review the manuscript and his comments appear as counterbalancing footnotes on many pages. That guy, he always does things a new way - as you will see.	2004-03-01

This interesting book traces the history and development of corporations from the time of Queen Elizabeth I to the present day. Much of the book focuses on little-known episodes in the corporate chronicle - the cruel Jamestown settlement in Virginia, for example, or the British East India Company's depredations in India. About midway through, the book shifts from such tales to a close examination of Supreme Court justices who tilted the playing field in favor of corporate power. Breezily written and accessible, this book puts a lengthy and complicated history easily within reach of ordinary readers. Its bias is clear - the subtitle leaves no doubt that author Ted Nace is a foe of corporate power - and the closer to the present the story comes, the more accusatory the author's conclusions may seem. Nonetheless, We find this is a worthwhile read for those who seek background information on the dark side of the American corporate success story.	2004-03-01

In 1971, President Richard Nixon ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold and thereby scotched the mechanism of international agreements and regulations that had governed the world monetary system since the end of World War II. Over the ensuing decades, the once-stable global monetary environment became an exciting, volatile new source of risk and opportunity. Manufacturers saw their fortunes rise and fall as currency shifts favored them or, alternatively, their competitors overseas. Financial institutions discovered new opportunities and dangers in fast-moving currency markets. We recommend this book for its detailed and generally clear, albeit often tedious, introduction to the tools, techniques and strategies readers may use to manage risk or speculate in the world's biggest financial arena - the unregulated international currency market.	2004-03-01

This is one of the most succinct and clearly written business books you will ever read. Author William Bridges uses language with care and precision, delivering the goods without any superfluous jargon. He cites many welcome quotations on change and innovation from a wide range of writers and thinkers whose work is not usually found in business books. He places these quotations in context with aptly chosen examples of recent business transitions, bringing intelligence and sensibility to a subject too often addressed only with clich&eacute;s and cant. Only those who have read many business books can fully appreciate the value of such an approach. Others will merely find that they are able to read this book from cover to cover without at any point having to wonder what the author really means to say. Managing transitions is really about helping people deal with fear and uncertainty - the key is to build trust and confidence. Everything Bridges says flows from that common sense insight, and seems obvious and necessary once he says it, though it may not seem as evident to you until you read his book. We highly recommends that you do so.	2004-03-01

Author Michael Salmon wastes no words, but provides a series of tips, questionnaires, checklists and exercises that will help everyone, even the most introverted, build a network productively and use it effectively. There is no fluff here, and minimal self-promotion. The book is mostly meat. The author is extraordinarily well organized and to the point. His advice on how to categorize relatives, friends and acquaintances may seem cold, but it is indispensable. Similarly, he recommends becoming a resource to others so that they may someday become a resource to you - a utilitarian and self-serving approach to human relations, but if you have no other reason to help people, this is not a bad one. One quibble: the book is repetitious and illustrates the hard truth with soft little imaginary anecdotes. That's more a fault of the genre than of the author. If you are in job search mode, We highly recommends this book to you. As the folks back home might say, write when you get work.	2004-03-01

This is an excellent book - well written, cogent and persuasive - the perfect launch of the new Art of Mentoring series. Alan M. Dershowitz, an impassioned and outspoken attorney, is keenly aware of the risks and pitfalls of legal practice. He squarely confronts the fact that lawyers often find themselves having to make moral or ethical choices in ambiguous circumstances in which the lesser of two evils is the only possible choice because there is no clear good - and yet, no clearly lesser evil. The book does not pretend to be objective. It is a compilation of advice, great courtroom war stories, practical tips and philosophical conclusions. Dershowitz is a fighter who chose his side long ago and has no intention of deserting it. Some of his more liberal positions will seem wrong-headed or ill-considered to those who disagree. Well, not ill-considered; he is a thoughtful man who takes lawyering seriously. We recommend this book to you whether or not you intend to study or practice law. It is valuable for an audience far broader than only young lawyers, including those who hire them.	2004-03-01

Broadwell and Carol Broadwell Dietrich expertly guide you through learning how to be the boss. They cover adjusting to your new role, acquiring the skills you'll need and coping with becoming a supervisor - from planning and organizing to directing and controlling. There may be just too much about stress and not quite enough about daily processes and follow through, but the information is solid across all subjects. The authors get right to the point, never sacrificing warmth, context or detail. Each section ends with thought-provoking group or individual exercises to reinforce what you've just read. We recommend this book to people who are taking their first supervisory positions, to those aiming for that goal and to anyone who has to train either of them.	2004-03-01

In a book that is more almanac than business history, author Barnett C. Helzberg Jr. includes a bit of narrative, but this is not a discourse on what he learned as he developed his Kansas City jewelry store empire, not a case study and not a look at how the sale of his company to Buffett went (which might have been a dandy negotiations yarn). Instead, it is basically a sound collection of sayings, aphorisms and - now and then, it must be said - platitudes about what he knew before Buffett came along. This is not, therefore, a book that We recommend necessarily reading from cover to cover. Instead, keep it handy. Pick it up when you are stuck for ideas or guidance, and peruse it for experience and sense. If all the thoughts are not particularly original, that is part of their appeal. Like a Polonius of the Plains, the author is never at a loss for a nostrum. He reaffirms the sound, traditional principles that guided the steady and sure growth of his business. It worked for Warren; it may well work for you.	2004-03-01

Every once in a while a little book comes along that, while small in size, carries sufficient intellectual weight to strike the body politic between the eyes, thereby getting its collective attention. This may be one such book. It offers a realistic look at megaprojects - those major infrastructure endeavors that span vast bodies of water, dam natural resources to generate energy and extend rail lines to previously unreachable regions - and compares the promises of these projects to what they actually deliver. The report card isn't very good. Cost overruns are typically 25% to 100%, and sometimes 200% or more. Worse yet, studies show that the public tends to use megaprojects - be they airports or subway systems - only a fraction of the amount predicted. We strongly recommends this book to politicians, legislators and anyone who wants to know the truth behind these huge infrastructure projects, as well as to CEOs, CFOs, project managers and risk officers in the private sector - this applies to your projects, even if there is a difference of scale.	2004-03-01

Author Howard Schilit writes in surprisingly plain English, and provides the reader with a toolkit to determine what's so rotten in Denmark - or on Wall Street. You don't have to be an experienced reader of financial reports to learn a lot from this book. Schilit offers more than theory; he provides specific examples and case studies. Learn about the manager who reduced future expenses by purchasing $12 million worth of advance postage metering at the end of the year. Find out how \\"Chainsaw Al\\" Dunlop drove up the price of Sunbeam stock by creating a $35 million reserve, all while laying off 11,000 employees. Learn the inside story of how Enron became the poster child for corporate wrongdoing. We highly recommends this book to independent investors, and anyone else who needs to understand how unethical execs cook the books. It may not save you from losing a bundle, but at least you won't feel like you're in a battle of wits and devoid of weaponry.	2004-03-01

Jack Welch, the former chairman of General Electric, is still a heroic managerial figure to many businesspeople, and his wisdom has found its way into the book market in many and various ways. Of course, numerous books are available about Six Sigma, the managerial philosophy that Welch made famous. But Six Sigma was only part of Welch's legacy. In this slim guide to the counsel of the man who earned the sobering sobriquet \\"Neutron Jack,\\" author Jeffrey Krames summarizes Welch's philosophy in 24 leadership principles, followed by brief notes and exercises for training managers.

This book disserves itself by purporting to be merely about scenario planning, although it covers that subject thoroughly. In fact, it's one of the most lucid, interesting examinations of fortune and folly you will ever read. The recapitulation of disastrous episodes at a handful of once-great companies shows just how little inclined the gods are to spare the proud. Closed minds and entrenched habits of thought managed to afflict even such a venturesome New Economy firm as Yahoo! Originality and experimentation bless even companies in humdrum industries, such as packaging. Captivating anecdotes and illustrations are, in fact, the meat of the book. The scenario planning analysis, while solid, is less convincing than the cases themselves. At times, the book shows the weaknesses that are probably inevitable when so many authors share creation. It tends to meander and, now and then, loses its way in jargon-choked thickets. But, we assure you, the clarity of the cases redeems it and makes it valuable.	2004-03-01

And so is Benjamin Graham. His books - Security Analysis and the Intelligent Investor - are the seminal texts on the subject of investing. Numerous investors (including Warren Buffett) owe their success to Graham's writings. Janet C. Lowe's book adds to the Graham myth. It weaves the story of Graham as a husband, father and loyal friend into his public life as a fund manager, writer and teacher. Lowe breathes life into an otherwise sterile topic, but her emphasis is on Graham's personal history more than on his investment advice. She does make it clear that Graham's fiscal belief system emphasizes intelligent investing by both the professional and individual investor. We recommend this  book to people who follow - and hope to profit from - the vicissitudes of the stock market and of its indelible characters.	2004-03-01

This book gives you the essentials about dealing with the media, starting with interviews and calls from reporters. Sally Stewart, former journalist and PR practitioner, delivers the nitty-gritty. Her advice to recognize reporters' financial and emotional pressures is particularly useful. Reporters have two clear priorities, she says, to write good stories and to go home. If you want their good will, try a little respect, she suggests, although she displays considerable cynicism and negativity about them. Her lessons include getting reporters to pay attention and which reporters to contact and how, be it by phone, e-mail or fax. Stewart tells you how to deal with unexpected calls from the press, and how to decide whether or not you want to be part of a story. If you do, here's how to make the most of it. And if you don't, this book tells you how to extricate yourself, if possible. Along the way Stewart explains how to dress for a television appearance. If this paragraph mentions any core skill you don't already have, we have a newsflash for you: get the book.	2004-03-01

Stand up straight. Pull your shoulders back. Be outgoing. Smile. If you've forgotten these lessons, this is for you. It's not what you know, it's who you know - and what they think and feel about you - that makes all the difference in your career. Be human. Ask for favors. Ask for information. Pitch in. Have a sense of humor. Speak slowly and listen carefully. Author D.A. Benton's presumably deep, probing interviews with 500 executives convinced her that charisma isn't inborn. She believes that everyone can learn to be charismatic. Just follow the six steps that can turn even the most repulsive excuse for a manager into a charming, charismatic executive. So, read this and practice. There's no harm in it, and it might do some good. However, while recommending this basic manual, suspects that the nature of charisma is a bit like the way a jazz musician explained the nature of jazz - if you have to ask what it is, you'll never know.	2004-03-01

Holton III and Sharon S. Naquin, both academics, invested substantial research to produce a little book that might just solve the very big midlife quandaries faced by workers whose jobs have been downsized or exported to another country. People who thought they would never need to take a different job find themselves the new person in a new office again, with no tools to help them cope other than the lessons of the corporate culture they left behind. However, using old cultural information in a new place is the road to disaster, according to the learned authors, who do a fine job of explaining why. Businesses are culture clubs and new hires must learn to get along before they can get ahead. At fewer than 100 pages, this is, nevertheless, a little redundant. Perhaps we need to hear the bell ring clearly, over and over, for the content is useful stuff simply told. For that reason, We recommend this to anyone contemplating a move, to every new hire and to every HR officer as part of the pre-employment package given to all experienced applicants.	2004-03-01

The debate on gender equity often emphasizes that women earn less than men with similar experience. Authors Linda Babcock and Sara Laschever say that while women may indeed be the victims of external forces, they also to some extent may suffer from their own inability, unwillingness or aversion to negotiate or make demands. In fact, men negotiate four times as frequently as women, and get better results. Men are much more apt to make demands and ask for benefits, pay increases and so forth. Men make more money not necessarily because the system is overtly discriminatory - though it well may be - but because men demand more. The book tends to belabor its point, and sometimes the evidence does not seem as well-presented as it might have been, but We found that it sheds useful light on a knotty social problem. Perhaps it will spur more women to fight - or to continue to fight - on their own behalf.	2004-03-01

Robert Rubin, Treasury Secretary in the Clinton Administration, believes in studying probability and risk. To him, uncertainty is part of life. Therefore, his inside look at the Clinton presidency and its global financial policies is carefully considered. He admits his mistakes and recounts his efforts and his successes. He offers tremendous insight on how the U.S.'s top leaders rescued other countries from financial quagmires, and he sounds an important alarm about the disconnect between the country's growing dependence on global trade and its public lack of support for world economic relationships. Rubin carefully walks the line between being self-serving and providing sharp insights. He doesn't offend the Clintons, though he presents events and himself - for this has an autobiographical side, as well - with apparent candor and honesty. He hasn't taken a lot of risks here, but that could reflect his experience. After all, Wall Street might be nearly as cutthroat as Washington. getAbstract.com highly recommends his book for its exploration of the Clinton presidency, its insights into fiscal policy making and its understanding that a nation's economic fate doesn't stop at its borders.	2004-03-01

It would be difficult to conceive of a more detailed corporate history. Author Douglas Brinkley offers an interesting, lucid narrative of Henry Ford's early experiments with the automobile, and his first, unsuccessful companies. He promises and delivers a \\"warts and all\\" picture of Ford's history. Brinkley is at his strongest discussing Ford's origins. But the book is also sprawling, diffuse and unfocused, with a somewhat confusing tendency to jump back and forth along the twentieth century timeline. It is more than a biography of Henry Ford, but less than a thorough history of the Ford Motor Company. The author nods in the direction of the technological, managerial and financial forces that have shaped Ford since the 1950s, though he presents Ford's (both man and company) earlier history in vivid detail. The impact of what Henry Ford did and how he did it still shapes industry in the United States. We recommend Brinkley's book for its revealing picture of one of the twentieth century's most influential industrialists.	2004-03-01

He delights in stinging big business and bulky government with facts both would prefer to ignore. Palast's strengths: his honesty, his willingness to admit he may be wrong, his sense of humor, his research and sourcing, and his unbridled passion to uncover wrongdoing. His weaknesses: his Tom Wolfe-influenced pop prose, his assumption that a conspiracy slithers beneath every log and his unbridled passion to uncover wrongdoing. He uncovers scandals such as the stolen Florida election, presidential protection of the Saudi royals right down to bin Laden's kin, bad energy and fiscal policy, and other mishaps and misdeeds, from the Exxon Valdez to Enron. Reading Palast is like drinking a stiff bolt of whiskey. It takes just a moment of reflection before you really start to burn. In this era of McJournalism, the citizenry needs more like him. We recommend this book to anyone growing weary of the status quo.	2004-03-01

Its optimistic theme is that freedom is a better management principle than control. Instead of relying on real-life examples, which might be hard to come by, the authors present a fictitious scenario in which wise older counselors impart the wisdom of freedom to young but amenable auditors. With freedom, workplace antagonisms and conflicts no longer fester. Employees cast aside their suspicions, differences, distrusts and other fruits of oppressive control, cooperating gladly and willingly in an atmosphere of near-utopian productivity. The real reward isn't corporate Eden, but personal accountability, freely given by employees who innovate and work hard because they are trusted. We trust that you'll know just how much freedom to apply before you create chaos instead of conscientiousness.	2004-03-01

Patton offer a seminal step-by-step guide to negotiating effectively. The authors use anecdotal examples to illustrate both positive and negative negotiating techniques. They believe that, with principled negotiation, both parties can reach an agreement in an amicable and efficient manner. Principled negotiation is based on the belief that when each side comes to understand the interests of the other, they can jointly create options that are mutually advantageous, resulting in a wise settlement. Since this is the second edition, the authors take the opportunity to answer ten common questions from readers of the first edition. If you become skeptical about these fairly rosy negotiation techniques as you read, the Q and A section is very useful. This classic text is easy to understand and you can implement its techniques immediately.  We can't ask for more than that.	2004-03-01

This handy guide endeavors to reduce the complex challenge of ethical leadership - with which great minds have struggled for thousands of years - to six simple and absolute rules of honesty. The authors, Larry Johnson and Bob Phillips, clearly explain each rule of absolute honesty they have derived and provide many illustrative anecdotes and examples drawn from daily life. There is a fascinating, moving story of one co-author's unforgettable experience as a high school track star, and another account about a couple whose marriage ended in divorce after the wife insisted on acting dishonestly. Perhaps the authors believed that this volume would move even the greatest crooks to resolute and unswerving honesty. Alas, that is beyond their scope. However We find that ordinary businesspeople seeking general guidelines might find useful counsel here. Hey, at least it's a start.	2004-03-01

Heavy but invaluable reading, this book presents the results of author David H. Maister's study of 139 offices of 29 professional service - more specifically, marketing and communications - firms in 15 countries. His objective was to identify the attitudes that correlate most strongly with financial success. He found what's been known all along - that financial success correlates very strongly with the perceived good character and integrity of management. When employees believe that management practices what it preaches, they seem to give extra effort and get astonishing results. The idea that character counts as much as, or perhaps more than, structure and corporate policy will be hard for many to accept. It takes courage, commitment, faith and humility to become the kind of person this study recommends. But this information shows us  that, to contradict baseball player Leo Durocher, nice guys finish first.	2004-03-01

Decades of research by scholars and financial practitioners have generally supported the reasonable counsel \\"don't put all your eggs in one basket.\\" But it is one thing to advise investors to diversify, and another to show them how. Author David M. Darst outlines a systematic approach to parceling out your savings among different investment assets. There's a science to asset allocation, though its principles are not immediately apparent. Darst treats these precepts with admirable thoroughness in a book that is, mostly, accessible to an educated layperson. But brew some strong coffee. Readers lacking a business or finance background may find the theoretical discussion difficult and tedious, particularly given the deliberate style. However this 2003 book follows one of the most dramatic periods in stock market history, the 1990s, when even sophisticated market watchers wondered if the sound financial principles cited here still applied. The ensuing bear market made it clear that the laws of risk and return had not yet been repealed. In this atmosphere, We  welcome this solid explanation of risk and return.	2004-03-01

Everywhere you turn there's another book being released by a motivational speaker. It's time to get back to basics, and the best way to do that is to go to the father of self-help himself - Dale Carnegie. This compilation of the best of his classics could be re-titled \\"Dale Carnegie's Greatest Hits.\\" It is packed with anecdotes of how famous and not-so-famous people through the ages have hit tough situations in life and overcome them. Although some of the language is dated - Carnegie wrote much the material in the 1930's - the situations he portrays are not limited to any era. You will be encouraged to know that you, too, can be happy, popular and organized. We recommend this book to anyone who works with people in any capacity; it could drastically change how you approach your life and the people around you.	2004-03-01

George Eckes' experience in quality control includes an instance where he had the temerity, just out of college, to ask W. Edwards Deming, then an octogenarian, to elaborate on his views about quality. \\"Those are the most stupid questions I have ever heard! Go read some of my books,\\" the cantankerous quality czar responded. No one reading this volume can doubt that Eckes has done his homework ever since. His blend of experience, theoretical expertise and common sense make this a very effective Six Sigma manual, although it is a little light on case studies. One of the book's most valuable elements is Eckes' keen analysis of the pitfalls that can flush all your best Six Sigma intentions down the tubes, even as a row of consultants tell you it is a panacea for all your woes. We recommend this book to anyone who is about to call a consultant and venture into the Rasputin world of Six Sigma.	2004-03-01

Authors Barbara Wheat, Chuck Mills and Mike Carnell use the format of a novel to explain two major quality control mechanisms: Lean Enterprise and Six Sigma, the efficiency approach that has had a broad impact on corporate America. In a sort of parable that shows both of these processes in action, they tell the story of a consultant named Samantha. She helps a business owner named Sid who has made all the wrong choices in setting up his manufacturing operation. Sam uses Six Sigma to help Sid out of his quagmire. The volume goes into greater, more useful detail about identifying and eliminating areas of waste than many other Six Sigma books. The text links the Five S's of Lean Enterprise with the systems problem-solving methodology MAIC (measure, analyze, improve and control). In all, here are the basics of Six Sigma and Lean Enterprise in an easy-to-use volume you can read on a commuter flight. We strongly recommends this book to those who want to begin to improve their firms' efficiency and productivity.	2004-03-01

This is a challenging book, mainly because author Clark Aldrich never seemed to quite make up his mind what kind of book he is actually trying to write. He has so much to teach about simulations that he tries to cover the whole waterfront. He moves from lofty pronouncements about the nature of education to the minutiae of designing one particular simulation, to generalizations about the similarities between fast food and training, to specific analyses of computer games. Any one of these themes could have provided the unifying thread for an excellent book. As it is, this reads a bit like the notes for more than one book yet to be written. But the notes are interesting and extremely well informed, and we found the in-depth detail about the construction of the author's own simulation quite revealing. If you aren't familiar with the growing use of simulations, this is a good place to start learning. You're going to need to know.	2004-03-01

This may be one of the best books about creativity, brands and advertising ever written. Author Michael Newman's long, successful tenure with Saatchi and Saatchi, one of the most innovative ad firms in the world, is itself impressive. He knows how to get attention in a market where attention is a scarce resource. His so-called \\"ten lessons in effective advertising,\\" really ten ideas about creativity, are unnecessary devices, probably a framework forced on a good book by an unimaginative editor. Read this book instead for the chrestomathy of quotations from literary and artistic innovators and thinkers. Read it for the asides, the tangents, the advertising war stories and the rambles. Read it for the shocking ads that push past the bounds of what anyone would consider acceptable. We recommend you read it for pleasure and for all these reasons; you'll get a lot more than ten lessons.	2004-03-01

Some of the challenges of managing global teams are obvious. For example, team members will probably speak different languages and come from different cultures. So how do you function in the Tower of Babel? Authors Michael J. Marquardt and Lisa Horvath recommend designating a common language, usually English for American companies. On the other hand, some of the challenges global team managers confront are not so obvious. For instance, what reward system do you use when everyone values different things? Can you just give everyone a pat on the back and a bonus, or must you individualize feedback mechanisms? What etiquette do you follow if everyone has a different sense of what is polite? If these issues haven't occurred to you already, you need this book. If they have, well, We still suggests this rundown on the very basics. As you may have guessed, all the issues you have already confronted with international employees get magnified with global teams.	2004-03-01

Imagine that companies throughout the economy had access to new, better technology every year, and made better products without raising prices - in fact, while cutting prices. Now imagine that the regulators and policymakers used outmoded measurements and models that ignored these quality improvements and this downward price trend. Imagine that the Federal Reserve saw a risk of rising prices even when prices were falling. Imagine that the Fed kept tightening the economy unnecessarily, sending interest rates up, slowing growth, inducing stock market crashes and recessions, and doing the opposite of what it should. If you can imagine all this, you have a picture of U.S. economic reality as seen by author Graham Tanaka. It's a picture no one, especially investors, should disregard. We found his book immensely interesting - too long by half, with too many repetitious references to his previous publications (perhaps just his way of saying, \\"I told you so\\"), often tendentious and labored, but not to be ignored. Just be cautioned: this sounds somewhat like the bubble speak we heard at the end of 1999 and the beginning of 2000 - other times of strong growth without inflation.	2004-03-01

He talks strategy, from preparation to planning to execution. The target: making a good impression. He provides tips on what to do to win the job and how to avoid making mistakes that doom the interview and plunge you into instant defeat. While some suggestions seem like common sense, you can't have too much of that in a competitive market. The book is particularly strong in its coverage of specific questions to anticipate and the types of responses to offer. We recommend this book to people who just showed up in the job market and to those in the early stages of waging this war. Most well-established job soldiers already command these skills - otherwise they'd be on the sidelines.	2004-03-01

Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in Economics, leaves the nebulous subject of globalization pretty quickly, and moves on to his real purpose: a sustained critique of the policies and practices of certain international institutions, especially the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Many of the author's insights will be old news to those experienced in international economic affairs, though not to the general reader, who will appreciate his straightforward, plain language. The author's status - as a Nobelist and as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors during the Clinton administration - makes his book distinctive and controversial. His prominence is a bully pulpit that he uses to inveigh against the IMF's power, secrecy and authoritarianism. We recommend his case for the prosecution, which is stirring and thought provoking, albeit marred by jabs against his old political and bureaucratic rivals and many variations on the theme \\"I told you so.\\"	2004-03-01

This comprehensive catalogue of sales tips, maxims and never-to-be-forgotten rules of thumb should be on every salesperson's desk. The author's advice on selling in a down economy is particularly useful. In fact, all that he has to say reduces to three or four core messages, repeated in a variety of modes and keys throughout the book. But these principles bear repeating, and it may be that one formulation will miss, while another will hit the mark. The author's relentless optimism, boosterism and cheerleading will put some readers off, but those readers probably won't be salespeople, who need all the encouragement they can get. We recommend this solid and useful book, and welcomes its up-beat attitude.	2004-03-01

This is an extraordinary, in the sense of out-of-the-ordinary, book. Flipping through it, you see page after page of loops and curves. At first, you might think it is a guide to drawing. And in a sense, it is. Most of the book explains how to use depictions of various types of loops to represent different kinds of business problems. Such problems never occur in isolation, because every business is a system, and everything that happens in a business has causes and effects that reach into other areas of the business and into the outside world. Author Dennis Sherwood is not peddling a simple notion, but rather is explaining \\"systems thinking,\\" a method of analyzing systems and processes. We unexpectedly found this quite entertaining, written with a light touch and bound to give almost any manager some new, valuable insights. On the down side, the author probably could have delivered his core message more succinctly, and after a while his insistence on demonstrating and categorizing the species and genera of loops begins to seem, well, a bit loopy.	2004-03-01

Author Donna Deeprose takes you inside the process of setting up and coordinating a project. Her book, a project in itself, no doubt, is as clear and well-organized as the work plan you'll be able to create when you finish reading it. As befits an author in the hands-on \\"Smart Things to Know\\" series, Deeprose provides charts, tables and worksheets for designing project activities, as well as a dandy summary of key points at the end of each chapter. She addresses planning in detail and offers examples of how to organize and present your project's master plan. While she does not skimp on straightforward logistics, the author emphasizes complex projects, where you have to plan for multiple activities and work with a team of people handling tasks of varying intricacy. Some of the general ideas about planning might be fairly familiar and obvious, but We recommend this book for its greatest strength: a solid presentation of specific procedures.	2004-03-01

Every business person needs a cranky mentor who speaks from vast experience and offers lessons and examples about the skills necessary to realize their ambitions in various business cultures. Author David F. D?Alessandro is a marketing guru, and a skilled phrase maker and spin doctor. To his own surprise, he was offered a chair at the management table where the bottom line decisions get made on his way to becoming CEO of John Hancock Financial Services. In the framework of rules for personal branding and in the interest helping you play office politics successfully, D?Alessandro spins dozens of yarns that bring context and reality to a subject that is often speculated about by authors who have never really achieved the success their books describe. His advice is ruthlessly honest, pointed, witty, precise and ripe with polished anecdotes.

Landes has written an extraordinary economic history that will open your eyes about countries' economic flops and good fortune. He also covers what makes a country achieve - and keep - great economic success. The book will appeal not only to economic history buffs, but also to the average person who needs to know how to keep a company or a country from economic trouble. Not to mention, he offers lots of great cocktail party anecdotes to impress your friends. Landes builds on solid economic data, but his unusual factual nuggets and vivid commentary are what make the book such a pleasure to read. In an age where politicians seek to make sure America stays economically relevant amid huge trade friction, We believe this book is a must-read for not just the chief executive officer, but for the rank-and-file workers who want to make sure they will be winners, not losers, in international trade. Landes has cooked up a great feast of economic history. Come, draw up a chair to the table and partake of this rich bounty.	2004-03-01

As might be expected, this is a well-organized book. Gleeson outlines some familiar approaches to getting organized, such as setting up an office system that deals with paperwork effectively. The book becomes more informative when it discusses some less familiar organizational techniques, such as planning chunks of time to deal with similar tasks, using technology and establishing routines for maintaining your organizational system. The book's major strength is the detail it offers about setting up files and systems, and following through on organizational initiatives. We enjoyed Gleeson's case histories of reorganizing various offices. She uses many of her basic principles in common sense ways - and the messes she repairs will make you feel like the top of your desk may not be hopeless after all.	2004-03-01

Most books about sales are written by people who have not sold anything in the past decade except their sales courses and their sales books. Few sales book authors have recent experience selling something concrete to the real world. This manual, on the other hand, is written like a speech by a man who got his sales talk training on the job and refined it at Toastmasters. He asks if he can tell us what he wants to tell us before he tells us. He tries several communications techniques, including a few duds that work as speeches given over rubber chicken dinners but bog down in print. Still, the voice of an everyman talking plain about sales language, sales skills and sales foibles is valuable. For its simplicity and useful anecdotes, We recommend this book to beginning salespeople, veterans with declining numbers, corporate communicators and entry level PR types.	2004-03-01

This is a good book for people who like parables. The fable centers around an unfocused man swamped by rivalry, envy, manipulation and betrayal. He never sees that his most threatening rival, though not as flashy as he is, has the stick-to-it commitment of a carnival pony that would continue walking the same tight circle even if someone took off its harness. To succeed, you need that kind of persistence plus a few straightforward disciplines including internal unity, clear purpose, open communication and personnel policies that reflect your values. In short, if you pick key disciplines and stick to them, you'll go far. You've heard this sweet if shallow lesson before, in the fable of the tortoise and the hare. That fable endured for centuries because it puts a simple truth in a few words using a vivid analogy. That is the kind of veracity this book is aiming for and though it may achieve a shorter reach, its wrap-up analysis and work sheets extend its practicality. We recommend its bolstering message - if not its simplistic structure - to managers who like metaphors.	2004-03-01

This is politics with attitude, presented by a former sixties activist who has plenty of sincerity and passion, though he has a somewhat convoluted writing style. Todd Gitlin - the former president of Students for a Democratic Society, the SDS - has a great deal to say, much of it worthwhile, though couched in nostalgic reminiscence of his youthful activism. Given that, former sixties protestors may find more here than current rightist young idealists. His observations on the faults of the Left and the strength of the Right are, if not original, stimulating. He does draw potentially useful lessons from the sixties, as seen through his prism of leftist activism and leadership. We recommend this fast, historic and forward-looking read. In these turbulent times, Gitlin encourages participation, discourages violence and believes the individual can still make a difference. Who could quarrel with that?	2004-03-01

Allison Hemming, who heads an interim workforce agency, discusses strategies you can use to get employed. She focuses primarily on entry level jobs and directs her advice to younger workers, especially those affected by the tight job market (hence the sassy, but unnecessarily tacky, sub-title). However, the basics of her technique can be applied by most job seekers. Hemming writes with an authoritative air, using a casual style to appeal to younger, hip workers, although her job hunting principles sound fairly basic. Note the book's tips on techniques to avoid and alternate techniques to pursue. She suggests niche searches on the Internet, targeted resumes and extensive networking. It's not very flashy but, nowadays, as job hunting increasingly becomes an extreme competitive sport, We recommend taking all the solid advice you can get.	2004-03-01

John Hoover, an organizational leadership consultant, discusses how to deal with an \\"Idiot Boss\\" - or I-Boss - who does stupid things. Hoover distinguishes idiots from other tricky bosses, including those who think they are God, or who are paranoid, sadistic or Machiavellian. He leaves the reader with a couple of issues. First, you'll think no good, caring bosses still exist. Second, he doesn't tell you clearly where to set boundaries or when enough is finally enough. He often advocates appeasing bad bosses, although his other counsel on how to deal with them has some effective pointers. To his credit, Hoover is very candid about how he has learned from experience, including his mistakes. He offers personal examples from his experiences at Disney and elsewhere, and tries to write in a light-hearted or whimsical vein. We found the book strongest when it is strategic and weakest when it tries to be funny, given that with bad bosses you only laugh to keep from crying.	2004-03-01

As American markets have evolved, so has the consumer. The aging American consumer (40 and over), now the New Customer Majority, makes purchasing decisions based on values, a shift that traditional marketing has failed to accommodate. The result is consumer dissatisfaction, diminished brand loyalty and expensive, ineffective advertising. Authors David B. Wolfe and Robert E. Snyder argue that marketers should acknowledge the new demographics and use techniques from brain research, developmental psychology, sociology and demographics to reach aging consumers. While the authors selectively cite data and successful marketing campaigns, they also offer a sound narrative and a refreshing, common sense point of view. On the downside, they use extensive marketing jargon, perhaps because they are ad consultants promoting their expertise. Citing attitudinal studies and new behavioral and brain chemistry research, they explain that marketers must account for their consumers' \\"season of life\\" to develop effective campaigns. We recommend this book to corporate marketing, investor relations, human resources, customer service and product development departments. It might even bridge the generation gap.	2004-03-01

Philip Davis and Dr. Benn Steil, leaves no stone unturned and virtually no question unanswered. The authors have managed to thread through the labyrinth of institutional investing, covering multitudes of regulatory, economic, practical and theoretical issues without ever losing their readers. Astonishingly well-organized and clearly written, this book is an outstanding reference. If it has a flaw, it may be that it is almost too vast to digest. And, of course, it is rapidly becoming dated. Having been published in 2001, it could not take into account the dramatic events and implications of the dot-com bubble and the wave of corporate scandals that raised such serious questions about the role and responsibility of institutional fiduciaries. Yet it does cover, with foresight, globalization and many other trends in the world of investment. We  highly recommend this book for all the knowledge it conveys to corporate finance executives and investors at every level.	2004-03-01

The Wright brothers were an amazing team. Working part time, these two previously undistinguished bicycle dealers from Dayton, Ohio, solved a problem that had baffled, frustrated and defeated (sometimes fatally) some of the most well-educated, well-capitalized and well known scientific entrepreneurs of their and all prior time. The story of how and why they succeeded in creating and flying the first airplane is not only fascinating, but also rich in didactic value for parents, teachers and businesspeople. Author Mark Eppler does an admirable job of drawing you into the story of the Wright brothers. Relishing the problem-solving principles he defines, which are, at times, refreshingly unorthodox. He abstracts these principles well and phrases them clearly, but the best demonstration of the principles lies in his retelling of the Wright brothers' absorbing story. A very good book indeed.	2004-03-01

Salespeople can't do the job alone. A complicated, corporate sale may require the involvement of a team: engineers, researchers, financial experts and salespeople - after all, you are trying to build the level of trust necessary to win and keep a major customer. Many companies fail to adopt the right policies and procedures to form and maintain effective selling teams. They seem to leave it to the folks involved to figure out whether, why, when and how they should work together. Reliance on the spontaneous emergence of teamwork may be a typical approach, but it is hardly the most effective. In fact, managing sales teams is multi-faceted and challenging. The stakes are always high - failure will cost real money - and the personalities that have to come together are often incompatible. We recommend this detailed, practical framework this books offers for creating and leading sales teams. It is straightforward and down to earth. While it does not break startling new ground, it does assemble in one convenient package most of the tried-and-true principles and practices of team selling.	2004-03-01

So often executives check their faith in God at the door before coming to work. Using the stories of 20 influential leaders to illustrate 10 business principles, author Larry Julian skillfully shows that it is possible to integrate your religious faith and your work practices. These men and women successfully run major organizations, and all of them credit their belief in God for their achievements. Although some of the stories are more inspiring than others, this book promises relief from the pressures of the bottom line and freedom from the stumbling blocks that impede success, both temporal and eternal. Each chapter includes thought-provoking questions you can contemplate or use as the basis of further discussions. Julian ends with a step-by-step business plan showing you how to apply all your newly processed spiritual knowledge as a practical tool. Although - given that it is dedicated to Jesus Christ - the book seems primarily directed to Christians, We suggest that any leader who is trying to make a profit, keep priorities straight and motivate employees should take a look.	2004-03-01

William J. O'Neil, founder of Investor's Business Daily (which he cites constantly in his book), provides an excellent how-to tour of his CAN SLIM investing approach. The method makes eminently good sense if you do what it says, when it says. Most investors risk failure, not because their systems are flawed, but because people are. O'Neil makes it clear: to be an investor, you must put forth enormous dedication, discipline, emotional fortitude and humility, and you need a sound strategy, such as CAN SLIM. The author may make investing look a tad too easy, though the charting he recommends is obviously going to take some time to accomplish and understand. But he pulls no other punches. His advice is knowledgeable and straightforward. He tells you what to do, and how to move ahead wisely and profitably. We think investors should read and study this honest, worthwhile book that summarizes the essentials of one of the latter twentieth century's most popular investing systems.	2004-03-01

If you want to run your own life - and who doesn't? - Cheryl Richardson will tell you how. The first step in her program is getting a clear sense of who you are and what you want. Then, tap into your inner power to develop the courage and confidence to move ahead. Richardson's examples from her personal life and from her clients' stories add lively human interest, and her comprehensive step-by-step program might intrigue many readers, particularly those who have just started reading self-help literature. Otherwise, this is a repeat of a frequently taught lesson about how to decide what you want and take steps to get it. Her exercises can help you clarify your goals as well as find and destroy any emotional barriers standing in your way. We recommend this book to readers, particularly women, who haven't already been down this path and absorbed this message; you will find that Richardson is an encouraging cheerleader.	2004-03-01

The best thing about this book is that it quotes extensively and piquantly from the writings and speeches of Jack Welch. The intriguing list of \\"29 leadership secrets\\" (which could have been reduced to ten) is more selective than secret, given that Welch has been preaching them loudly from a very prominent platform for more than 20 years. However, the book will be valuable to Welch neophytes and to fans who want more Jack, or the essence of Jack. Author Robert Slater assumes a certain familiarity with GE's history and initiatives, and sometimes refers to them without explanation. Welch long ago transcended management to become sort of a leadership prophet, and his utterances are sometimes paradoxical, if not contradictory. He says nurture people, but downsize; he says cut bureaucracy, but implement a paperwork intensive Six Sigma program. We promise that somewhere in here, you'll find a managerial principle to fit almost any occasion. What more can you ask of a handbook?	2004-03-01

Running a business these days feels like going on a blind date with the future. Most efforts to understand what lies ahead take on a rather breathless quality, lapsing into technobabble as they struggle to avoid the future's central truth: unknowability is its essence. Marshall McLuhan once observed that anticipating the future is like steering an automobile by looking into your rearview mirror. Yes, seeing where you've been does give you some idea of where you're going...but not much. That said, We strongly recommends this look into the crystal ball of technology. It's a clear improvement over most works of the future-shock genre. Soundly rooted in practical business applications, and presenting surprising examples and possibilities without resorting to mind-numbing jargon, this book will prove very useful to anyone savvy enough to realize that just improving your business is no longer enough.	2004-03-01

For all the headlines they grab, mega-mergers typically aren't a good deal for anyone but corporate executives and investment bankers. And guess what? This was just as true when J.P. Morgan created U.S. Steel in 1901 as it was when Steve Case engineered the AOL-Time Warner merger in 1999. Financial expert Charles R. Geisst dissects a century's worth of deals in fascinating detail. His conclusion: investor and regulator beware. Geisst's accessible style is a plus, and he manages to be skeptical but not jaundiced in this thorough, clear-eyed analysis. We suggest this book to any executive contemplating an M&amp;A deal, and to any investor trying to cut through the hype surrounding mergers.	2004-03-01

Visit any healthy manufacturing operation and you'll see a buzz of bewildering activity - parts being moved on overhead cranes, raw materials being wheeled in, line operators checking their production schedules before they change the line over to their next product. Those production schedules, as this book suggests, can really be a hindrance. Operators become dependent on them, although the schedules may not accurately reflect customer demand. The solution? Kanban, which is based on having a communication system right on the factory floor that communicates key indications of customer behavior - buying, ordering, canceling - directly to the workers themselves. Production activity, therefore, is actually scheduled based on customer demand rather than on past expectations, with the advantage that you hold less inventory and operate more effectively. This book (which comes with a compact disc of implementation directions) gives clear insight into this powerful scheduling system employed efficiently by Toyota and other world-class companies. We highly recommend it to executives, managers and supervisors of companies that earn their living by making widgets more successfully.	2004-03-01

Your thinking ability resides in six kinds of intelligence: verbal, visual, logical, creative, physical and emotional. Each one has a different function but, even setting aside the promises of the breathless title and subtitle, this book offers growth in each area with a simple and healthy collection of mental exercises. Author Jean Marie Stine states that you can develop your full intellectual capabilities as well as tap into that unused 90%. And, you probably want to, given her observation that people with highly developed skills in these areas are more likely to succeed than people without them. Therefore, she recommends that you read, look attentively at the world, learn to think in an orderly manner, be aware of body language and use all your abilities. Every chapter contains an inspiring yarn or two, and some beneficial exercises. So, we suggest, you start reading and learn to think in a whole new way. Imagine what you could accomplish if you could harness 100% of your mental powers.	2004-03-01

Say the boss drops dead and suddenly you're the acting boss. Or the company reorganizes, everyone above you is fired and guess who's in charge. Imagine that your career suddenly becomes one of those movies where the plane starts to go down and some poor, benighted sap finds himself in the pilot's chair trying to land a 747 on a stormy night on what is either a landing strip or just a long, broad swath of plankton in the water. Can you land it? What do you do? You're responsible. Suddenly people look at you in a different way. Your friends no longer completely trust you, your enemies are working actively to undercut you and your ability to come to terms with accidental leadership will make or break your career. It is full of little motivational tips, kind words and straight talk covering everything from managing complex and difficult teams to firing people (tip: avoid Christmas Eve). The book is thin, a quick read and a good one.	2004-03-01

This book offers a learning-centered introduction to the field of knowledge management. Each of the three sections (Strategy, Process, Metrics) sets the tone with an opening essay by a well known authority in the field. Several previously unpublished essays that develop the chapter follow each opening piece. This convenient plan makes it possible for time-pressed readers to get the gist of the matter by reading only three or four essays in the area that most concerns them. It also allows readers with a consuming interest in the subject to get all of the details they could possibly desire. Some of the essays are accessible; some are quite heavy going, laden with jargon and dense academic prose that only a specialist could decipher. Thus, we are grateful that the editors have made it so easy for readers to find what they need to know in this well-organized, thorough study of the field of knowledge management.	2004-03-01

This excellent short guide to the promise and peril of e-mail reveals some surprising and little-noted facts. Far from creating a paperless office, for example, e-mail has multiplied the paper businesses consume. Along with making communication more convenient, immediate and spontaneous, e-mail has raised false expectations and increased the probability of hard feelings and misunderstandings. If those were the only problems this book spotlights, it would be worthwhile to take it seriously. But author Christina A. Cavanagh additionally offers some frightening examples about the invisible cost of e-mail, measured in terms of employee time and legal risk. The book has a tendency to repetitiveness and prolixity, and many of the recommendations for managing e-mail are familiar. However, We  particularly recommends her strong examples, which may convince managers to implement the best practices they may already understand but often ignore.	2004-03-01

Take a look at the scandal-filled headlines, or just read a Dilbert comic strip about cubicle culture, and the message is clear: the business world is cutthroat, unethical and no fun. But here comes psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi with a contrarian message. Work should be fun, and companies should care about something aside from the bottom line. Using examples such as clothing maker Patagonia and investment pioneer Sir John Templeton, Csikszentmihalyi makes a convincing case that profits must come after meaning. Patagonia, for instance, lets workers take surf breaks, and Templeton became a model of full engagement. We suggest this book to any manager seeking a better way to do things, and to any employee hankering for deeper job satisfaction.	2004-03-01

This book differs from most other Six Sigma guides in that it identifies, by name, companies that failed at Six Sigma. So many authors have presented Six Sigma as something magical that it is refreshing to see its warts. Make no mistake - the authors are not out to debunk or dethrone Six Sigma, a management philosophy and method that has been their professional life for many years. They clearly believe that Six Sigma is worth the investment of time, brain power, leadership and political capital that it requires. But they aren't afraid to point out the fact that it does require serious investment, and that management must sustain its commitment for years to unlock the full benefit of the Six Sigma approach. The book is a tolerably good read, albeit dry. It mercifully spares the reader any puffery or promotion, and it lays out the axioms of Six Sigma life in a very lucid format. Occasionally, it stoops to clich&eacute;, but not terribly often. We  recommend it to those who need to know what it really takes to achieve Six Sigma performance, and how to begin.	2004-03-01

A son of Oklahomans who moved to Seattle, he went to a private school, met Bill Gates, helped start Microsoft and has had billions of dollars to play with almost ever since. OK, so when Microsoft first went public, he only had a hundred million or so to play with. He's been sued for sexual harassment, owns a big chunk of a hot movie studio and is still an ordinary slob. Allen and his family refused to cooperate with the author, so nothing is straight from the horse's mouth - at least not that horse. The author shows admirable self restraint for the first several chapters, but really pulls the lid off later in the book. Allen comes off looking like a junior level IT nerd who won the lottery, a weirdly fascinating, odd guy. The book is easy enough to read, though it relies mainly on secondary sources and press reports, and is repetitious, disjointed and inclined to skip important information, such as dates. But, if you want the gossipy side of the Microsoft story, We suggest this as your vacation reading.	2004-03-01

Whitmore elucidates the advantages of a criterion-referenced instruction program based on having employees practice new skills and tasks. This differs from traditional or academic training programs in that skills are evaluated through performance rather than tests. As he explains it, you can feel how much he believes in teaching job competence through practice. However, while this approach might work well for certain skills that lend themselves to being taught readily through repetitive practice, it may not work as well for tasks that involve creativity and non-routine thoughtful activity. Thus, he may overstate the advantages of his one-size-fits-all approach. The book provides voluminous detail about creating systems to organize and deliver skill-based training, so we believe it will have specific appeal to its target audience: learning officers, training managers and human resource directors.	2004-03-01

Amid the slew of personal finance books on the market, Suze Orman's unique approach stands out. Although she has more than 20 years of financial experience and expertise, her books don't merely dispense advice from on high. Her monetary rules may be universal and timeless, but she describes them with the sympathetic voice of a best friend. Written in the aftermath of the collapse of the Internet bubble, her latest advice book aims to comfort shell-shocked investors who are facing huge losses. Orman's primary tactic is to remind readers that money is a means to an end, not an end in itself, and that decisions about money take place in a larger personal and spiritual context. To that end, a helpful workbook is included. We recommend this book to anyone who is wary of making financial decisions in today's unsettling market environment, as well as to those looking to sort out their financial priorities.	2003-10-15

White provide practical instructions for dealing with change, as all leaders must. Rather than assuming that only certain personality types and traits are suitable for leadership in changing times, they addresses the behavior patterns that mark a successful leader. The authors place their behavioral concepts in a familiar context with case histories. The true value of their book lies in specific exercises that will enhance your ambiguity-coping skills. Some level-headed readers may be slightly put off by the seeming wackiness of some of these notions (they range from \\"spend some time around children\\" to \\"analyze how you spend your time\\") and the light-hearted tone (they do refer to Star Trek). Lighthearted or not, the advice in this book may just save your job - or your company's future. We recommend this book to senior executives, regardless of industry, as well as to anyone who is concerned about the fast pace of change and wants some help keeping up.	2003-10-15

Business coach Terry Pearce teaches you how to put the personal perspective back into your professional communications. With a credible and authoritative voice, he explains how authentic human connection is missing from today's communications, even though people crave it, especially as they evaluate who they trust to lead them through rapid change. He maintains that leaders who communicate authentically and passionately will inspire loyalty and make their mark. While Pearce is clearly convinced about the importance of inspiring your constituents, the pace of his book won't exactly move your spirit. He walks you slowly and carefully through the discipline he uses to help clients rediscover their authentic voices and craft messages that resonate. His corporate and political client list is quite select, but we find his communication strategies relevant for anyone who is leading change - whether you are building a small community or a large company.	2003-10-15

The Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year (EOY) Awards identify the best entrepreneurs, and author Gregory K. Ericksen runs the awards program. This gives him unusual insight into the judging criteria and the winners' performance standards. His clearly written text brings you into the judging process, and then explains how your business can triumph in leadership, team building, innovation and financial performance. He shares advice and experience from judges (former EOY winners) and current winners. Profiles of the judges and longer examinations of winning companies - including Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Southwest Airlines and 1-800-Flowers - offer practical case histories of entrepreneurs who have done it all, from starting out in garages to surviving disasters to succeeding in pacesetting businesses. Despite his cheerleading tone, Ericksen gets down in the trenches of entrepreneurship. We recommend his inside look at its triumphs and travails to owners and managers of businesses large and small.	2003-10-15

This book is one of the few thorough, detailed, systematic guides to team leadership in the context of Six Sigma. Those assigned to lead or participate in Six Sigma teams will find it hands-on practical and consistently useful. To use this specific approach to team management, you need to be familiar with the Six Sigma concept and process already. Then, this straightforward, explanatory manual will take you step by step, list by list, through the task of facilitating a successful team, from establishing a plan to dealing with problem personalities. It isn't exactly juicy reading, except for the lively illustrative anecdotes, and the grammar is occasionally awkward given the jargon involved, but this focused package of instructions will help you get the job done effectively and efficiently. We recommend it enthusiastically to managers who are embarking upon, or already involved in, a Six Sigma team management process.	2003-10-15

This book is relevant to all those who suspect \\"WWW\\" stands for \\"World Wide Wait.\\" If you don't understand the Internet's shortcomings, just type \\"antidisestablishmentarianism\\" into the Google search engine and try to make sense of the 5,890 returns you get. Currently, there are three billion pages of information on the Internet, but within the next year that number will double. The question is how to manage the data while still increasing the functionality of the Web, continuing its transformation from a place where you \\"find something\\" to a place where you \\"do something.\\" To accomplish those tasks, you have to go beyond \\"meta-tags\\" - those invisible headlines that tell search engines what any given page is really all about. This volume outlines the Semantic Web approach, which offers answers to those questions. A word of warning: this somewhat technical book will be of greatest interest to programmers, Web designers, specialists and motivated visionaries. We recommend it highly - if you fit into one of those categories.	2003-10-15

This book is essentially a collection of practical checklists interspersed with quotations and anecdotes. It certainly meets its objective of collecting everything you need to know about managing a professional service firm's practice group. Patrick McKenna and David H. Maister present the nuts and bolts in a straightforward format. If you feel like you could use some help to do a better job of leading your group of highly trained individuals, if you've just been promoted to the ranks of management and want some guidance or, worse, if you feel like you are herding cats - in Maister's phrase - instead of leading a committed team of professional people, we are pleased to recommend this complete toolbox to you.	2003-10-15

This is a very lucid, practical introduction to the principles of value investing. It is detached, relatively objective considering the authors' bias in favor of the subject, doesn't hype or hard-sell and, on the whole, would be a valuable addition to any investor's bookshelf. If you're a relative beginner, your shelf will also need to include a dictionary of financial terms - the authors assume you already know the vocabulary. And who is the Graham cited in the title? He is Benjamin Graham, who all but invented security analysis. With coauthor David Dodd, he produced the book Security Analysis in 1934. Later, Graham wrote The Intelligent Investor. Both books are investment classics and have been revised and re-issued. This one may endure, as well, based on its thorough exposition on how to value a company and its instructive profiles of value investing heavyweights. Our recommendation: strong buy, long term hold.	2003-10-15

From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog may sound like a mystifying title, but this book provides a reasonable overview of the history of the software industry. At times, given the ups and downs in the industry, it can't avoid sounding like a catalog of defunct firms and obsolete software. However, this chronology is quite useful for anyone who wants to come up to speed very quickly and very generally on the main trends in the industry. Author Martin Campbell-Kelly covers some of the industry's seminal events and the main categories of software. Vexingly or refreshingly, he takes pains to say as little about Microsoft as possible, making it clear that others have written enough on that subject. So, with that absence duly noted, we recommend this book to those who want an inside history of the software industry, from massive mainframes to little blue cartoon porcupines.	2003-10-15

A special note in the preface of this book explains that it went to press just as the Enron story was beginning to break. Three of its chapters provide almost all the information anyone would have needed to spot the problems at Enron, not to mention at the other big corporations whose scandals made recent headlines. Spotting fraud isn't that hard. The authors provide a very useful toolkit that even a novice investor can use. Some of their coverage of the regulatory apparatus will no doubt have to be changed in future editions, as the regulations themselves keep changing, but this enlightening introduction to the nitty-gritty of skeptical financial statement analysis will have enduring utility. It's written by accountants, so it gets a bit plodding in spots, but their anecdotes relieve the tedium and their information is invaluable. We recommend this reality check for every investor's bookshelf, as well as every employee's and every financial reporter's. Anyone who depends on corporate performance or who uses corporate financial statements should read it.	2003-10-15

Monica Langley follows Sandford Weill, a shy Jewish boy from Brooklyn, through his youthful struggles against adversity, his journey to the absolute top of the financial world and his tainted success. Seen through the prism of Weill's tumultuous career, the financial world is small, despite its importance, internally more like a village than a city. The book just confirms your suspicions that practical finance bears almost no resemblance to what you learned in economics class. We commend Langley for skillfully molding the saga of this titanic financier's career into such a compelling, well-constructed narrative.	2003-10-15

As an Army Ranger, Dean Hohl endured Ranger School, in which he was forced to figure out how to survive 14 days in the woods with only 14 meals. He later parachuted into Panama during the U.S. invasion. Now a consultant who leads corporate types through Ranger-style boot camps, Hohl and co-author Maryann Karinch make a convincing case that business leaders can benefit from the same type of training Rangers are given. Organizations need leaders who are flexible and communicative, he argues in an engaging and illustrative way. Hohl resists the temptation to dwell too much on his own war stories, although at times he'd do well to rely more on his experiences and less on bloodless summaries of corporate problems seemingly parroted from the business press. We recommend this book to any manager who leads or works with a team. If you wish that your team could act like a Ranger platoon, start reading.	2003-10-15

Noted sales trainer - and the head genius of cold calling - Stephan Schiffman succinctly describes 25 effective sales techniques. Each tip gets a short chapter with a nugget of advice, an example or two and a pat on the back to send you out the door charged up and ready to go. It doesn't matter if you've heard some of these common sense ideas before because Schiffman's compilation is so on-target, lively and encouraging. This little volume reminds you of leading sales techniques - or habits, as Schiffman calls them - that will build your customer base and increase your sales. If you're in the business of one on one product or service sales, this will boost your communications, planning, knowledge, rainmaking, visibility and confidence. Schiffman tells you to ask people what they do and help them do it better by selling into their priorities. Seems clear enough to us, given that the author doesn't only write - he also sells.	2003-10-15

Author Richard Koch contends that individual initiative is responsible for most progress, given that 20% of entrepreneurs or innovators are responsible for 80% of results and new ideas. Koch focuses on how to be a successful entrepreneur by working with a small team of supporters. He discusses the importance of good ideas, great colleagues, a powerful value proposition, good partners and, of course, ample capital. He suggests a trend toward a new breed of corporations based on individualism, though Bill Gates and Warren Buffett alone do not necessarily make a trend. While Koch writes in a breezy, engaging style, the 80/20 mantra becomes generalized and repetitious. It's a popular expression, but does it always apply? The other chapters are more solid, though they restate known entrepreneurial principles and techniques, dressed in 80/20 lingo. As such, we suggest, they may be a good introduction for the new entrepreneur, if not for the rugged individual who has already mastered the percentages.	2003-10-15

Aswath Damodaran backs up his explanations of investing philosophies with ample studies, detailed graphics and a website, even if you need to absorb the dense, detailed data in 15 minute chunks. This well-researched, solid book will be useful to individual investors, investment managers and anyone who wonders why various investment philosophies succeed and how (and at what risk) portfolio gains are made. The index investing chapter and the final summary are required reading for investors wondering how huge portfolios crashed after U.S. equities collapsed. We recommend this soup-to-nuts introduction to sophisticated investing. Your financial security could hinge on a good grasp of the issues it covers.	2003-10-15

The good news is, Richard Florida's book recognizes the growing economic and sociological impact of creativity. The bad news is that in just two years, it has lost some of its gloss. The collapse of the bull market, the popping of the dot.com bubble, the 9/11 trauma, each took some shine off of the creative economy, with its casual dress days, flexible schedules and free rides. But even though this appraisal occasionally sounds quaint, we believe that the book's faith in the transforming economic and social power of creativity, its broad view, and its excellent references and quotations make it worth recommending.	2003-10-15

Despite its title, this book doesn't say much, or much of substance, about business today. Instead, it concentrates on lively professional and personal profiles of eight twentieth century management theorists of varying impact. Hammer and Champy, who launched the 1990s re-engineering movement, are mentioned only in the conclusion, and the gurus behind managing for shareholder value aren't mentioned. A little less detail about peccadilloes of the long dead and a little more about crucial management ideas that have shaped contemporary business might have made the book more relevant. Interestingly, it indicates that slave owners anticipated some of the progressive ideas in modern management but the author leaves it to the readers to make the connection: voila, contemporary workers believe the cant of empowerment about as much as the slaves believed the plantation master's pieties. We recommend this book for its anecdotal, gossipy entertainment value. It will make you cautious about management consultants - but if you aren't already, you can't have spent much time in business	2003-10-15

Dinesh D'Souza has produced earlier incisive, groundbreaking books. Illiberal Education and The End of Racism are both thought-provoking reads for conservatives and liberals alike, but this is one has an additional purpose: a comprehensive outline of conservative doctrine and a blanket condemnation of the opposing points of view. D'Souza revisits some previously published opinions, and if he doesn't always support them with fact, he does bring heartfelt argument to the fore. He also refers back to his other two books when illumination is needed. The book, as the title suggests, is formatted as a series of letters to a college student, complete with fond recollections of the author's days as a conservative firebrand at Dartmouth. Even constrained by this gimmick, D'Souza is an entertaining writer who delights in, \\"harpooning liberals,\\" eloquently if with slight regard for fairness. We recommend this book as an ideological dessert for potential conservatives, more than as a soup-to-nuts guide to conservatism - and its no-shades-of-gray approach may even help liberals prepare their counterarguments.	2003-10-15

Erica Orloff and Kathy Levinson pair up to deliver a jam-packed, step-by-step, practical guide on how to \\"have it all.\\" You can conduct a fulfilling career and have a personal life at the same time, if you work at home. Today, with the majority of America working from home in some capacity or another, this book is a must-have on almost every bookshelf. In their hysterically funny way, the authors bring to light any snare you can imagine (and some you'd never think of!) while starting a home business or venturing into the world of telecommuting. And if they make it sound just a little too breezy, you'll find that out as you proceed. So whether you're just toying with the idea of reducing your commute time to less than 60 seconds or your business has already taken over your home, we recommend picking up this quick read and spending some time with two funny ladies who know first hand how to make a home-based business work.	2003-10-15

Chances are you're selling to the wrong people. In this A-to-Z primer, Anthony Parinello explains how to get your foot in the executive suite. To be successful in sales, he says, go right to the top. Although well organized, the content at times reads like a stream-of-consciousness speech. Many of the \\"secrets\\" Parinello reveals are plain common sense - it's hard to believe that anybody in sales wouldn't know them. His advice about using the Web for research is dated (when was the last time anybody used the term \\"information superhighway\\"?), but the principles he outlines are timeless and make this a great read which we recommend to performance-oriented sales people and sales managers. Overall, this inspirational, motivational account should fire up sales people and help them see the forest, not just the trees.	2003-10-15

Investing Under Fire is a very interesting collection of essays by 30 luminaries from various fields, some of them not at all related to investing. Each selection contains at least a thought or two to repay the effort of perusal, and that's a great deal more than many books deliver, especially books about investing. The anthology's five segments cover mutual funds, key sectors - from Asia to precious metals, research and legal resources, innovative companies and geopolitical influences. Anyone who merely reads the first selection, by Vanguard founder John Bogle, and applies its lessons, would more than recapture the purchase price of the book. Despite the sometimes self-promotional comments from a few of the other contributors, it's a very valuable book. If nothing else, we note, it will expose you to a spectrum of diverse opinions, a useful prophylactic against complacency.	2003-10-15

The first edition of Bernard Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street appeared in 1973, a few years after the twentieth century's first big computer technology bubble, the go-go era, popped. This, the newest and eighth edition, appears after the popping of the dot.com bubble, the last of the twentieth century's great computer technology bubbles. Investors burned in the first bubble could have been excused; after all, they didn't have Malkiel's book. But it's astounding how avidly Internet speculators threw aside all that Malkiel and others had taught them. This book belongs on every investor's bookshelf, and ought to be consulted, or at least touched to the forehead, before any investment decision. Most investment books aren't trustworthy, because their authors are salespeople who are really making a pitch instead of trying to inform you. Malkiel is disinterested. He is a teacher with the intellectual discipline of a true financial economist, and yet he writes as vividly as a good journalist. We recommend this classic: all you need to know about the market is between its covers.	2003-10-15

Ken Blanchard of One-Minute Manager fame draws on the positive training techniques that SeaWorld whale trainers use to get their whales to want to perform. Although using whale training as a teaching model is a unique twist on the literature about training and motivating employees, the material itself is not nearly as exotic. Much of it draws upon traditional principles for getting along with others, such as building trust, emphasizing the positive and redirecting undesired actions into more productive channels. If you've read Blanchard's previous book about being aware when people do something right so you can praise them, some of this content will seem familiar, though he says this is his \\"most important\\" book. The story line tracks mythical businessman Wes Kingley's discussions with whale trainers who reveal what they do to train their creatures, gradually, carefully and with real warmth. These conversations blow some very basic points up to whale-size, but Blanchard writes with charm. We recommend this splashy manual, the first course in Whale Psyc 101.	2003-10-15

Robert Miles knows Warren Buffett, and it's clear that he also knows a thing or two about the people who run the companies in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Armed with information gleaned from eight months of intensive interviews, Miles uncovers what makes a Berkshire manager tick, and covers the workings of Berkshire, itself, as well. Writing through the voices of the CEOs he portrays, Miles skillfully weaves the colorful histories of 18 firms into a revealing set of success stories. Many tales are similar - the CEOs love their companies; they worked hard to build solid businesses and no one regrets selling his firm to Berkshire. They all sound genuinely happier than you might possibly believe, and each chapter has business models you shouldn't miss. We invite any executive  to enter these pages for an insider's view (still, it doesn't hurt to remember, they all knew Warren was gonna read it).	2003-10-15

This impressively researched opus reflects an obsession with One Big Idea that never comes quite clearly into focus, but revolves around the critical historical role played by national credit. Behold an author who not only quotes the Biblical book of Numbers, but also interprets it as a document of financial history, ignoring the contentious issues of authorship and anachronism that make scriptural exegesis such challenging work for specialists. He traces the way government and conflict are funded from Herodotus to the Hanoverian Court to Woodrow Wilson. Like the River Platte, this work is a mile wide and an inch deep; but the river has a definite direction, and this meanders. If you fancy an intriguing browse through major and minor points of political and fiscal history, we have found just the book for you. Some scenes are indelible, like the Germans celebrating WWI bond purchases by driving iron nails into a big wooden statue of a Field Marshall, and may jolt you if you think Allied and Axis powers were funded differently. The U.K. and the U.S. sponsored similar popular financial mobilizations, complete with bombastic slogans (no statues, though).	2003-10-15

Mary Kay, Inc., is perhaps best known for two things: the cult of personality surrounding its founder, Mary Kay Ash, and the fact that it rewards successful salespeople with pink Cadillacs. In this illuminating book, management expert Jim Underwood delves into the guiding principles of Mary Kay, Inc.'s daily operations, which remain, 40 years later, true to Ash's founding vision. Countries or corporations founded by a charismatic leader often sag or sink when that leader inevitably steps down. Mary Kay's leadership was unique in that she built a solid foundation for the company so it could continue without her day-to-day guidance. This corporate biography represents the first time the privately owned company allowed an outsider complete access to its managers and employees, enabling Underwood to persuasively illustrate nine leadership rules with testimonies from members of the \\"Mary Kay family.\\" We recommend this to anyone who aspires to leadership. Mary Kay may look fluffy, but it's all about the firm.	2003-10-15

This book is a bit unfocused, but even its tangents are interesting. You get a few pages here on Chinese history, a few pages there of polemic about rich nations' unfair trading practices, here a digression, there a ramble. It's not completely about China and it's not completely about the WTO, though those bases are covered, and the other subjects it touches upon - including Asian regional economics - add to its value. The authors put both sides of the debate over trade in reasonably fair focus. We confirm that what they say about China, while not new, merits mulling over by anyone affected by globalization.	2003-10-15

Roger Dawson, a top speaker and writer on negotiation and persuasion, has written, in fact, a very persuasive book. Solid research that identifies effective sales strategies and explains why they work sets Dawson's book apart from many other volumes on sales techniques - even when his advice is repetitive. He warns you away from manipulation, though he doesn't hesitate to use some forms of it, along with psychological insight, time pressure, friendship, subliminal messages and outright emotion to persuade clients to buy. Dawson writes in an easy-to-read, breezy, yet authoritative style and includes tricks, techniques, clever anecdotes and chapter summaries. The book is as well organized as a speech in which Dawson tells you what he is going to say, says it and then tells you what he just said. We recommend this book to people who want to sell better, and who have the starch to use intense powers of persuasion.	2003-10-15

The author suggests a radically simple yet enormously challenging way of bringing the world's impoverished billions onto the track of capitalism and development: give them legal property rights to what they \\"own.\\" The author's intriguing case is that a lack of property rights - not a lack of entrepreneurial zeal or competence - stymies development in the former East Bloc and Third World countries. This seemed to be a shockingly original notion when the author first propounded it in his bestseller The Other Patch, and it still does. If the book has a flaw, we warn, it is that the author's undisguised missionary ardor sometimes makes one wonder whether he is merely a zealot. Even if he were one, the book would merit reading.	2003-10-15

This book is worth reading, given that the Carlyle Group employs important former politicians (such as the first President Bush) and deals with politically sensitive companies. This history of the mammoth private equity firm with its fingers in many government pies reminds you that the right relationships and the right schools can compensate for professional ineptitude. And, if a fraction of author Dan Briody's implications about it are true, democracy is in serious trouble. But is even a fraction true? This clumsy compilation leaves you wondering. More original reporting and less exaggeration and bias would have helped Briody prove his conspiracy theories. Unfortunately, he does not display the requisite expertise about finance, law, politics or the arms trade. Indeed, given the innuendoes he delivers in breathless, clichd prose, you could ask if the book just might include a stretcher or two. It is a suggestive stage whisper from outside the political theater's back door. We say you'll find this novelistic report intriguing, if you take it with a grain of salt.	2003-10-15

Identity theft is an inevitable but horrifying form of abuse in a society that depends largely on trust, credibility and the free flow of information. Victims often don't even know they're being taken advantage of until their accounts are drained and their credit is ruined. Sometimes, they don't know until the police break down their door, arrest them at gunpoint and throw them into jail for crimes identity thieves have committed in their names. This book will tell most readers more than they probably want to know about the crime of identity theft, with anecdote after anecdote about repugnantly clever thieves. It's not particularly well written and lifts too much from public documents and testimony, but this isn't the kind of book one reads for pleasure. This concise, very useful guide to self-protection points out many sources for additional information and action. We highly recommend it for the purpose of minimizing your risk. After all, you want to protect the answer to that eternal question of identity, \\"Who am I?,\\" from the thief who claims, \\"I am you.\\"	2003-10-15

Peters should be respected as a writer and thinker willing to journey across perilous ground. He has spent most of his life and career writing and teaching about the three great Middle Eastern religions: Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Trying to be objective about three religions that often have been locked in mortal rivalry is hardly a safe route to the destination of political correctness. Perhaps the most valuable thing about Peters' book is that it is essentially non-polemical: it does not appear to reflect any particular religious point of view. Certainly, it is very well researched. Peters sheds a wealth of light on conflicts that are central to the events unfolding on the world stage, although he focuses more on historical development than on contemporary issues. While the degree to which objective analysis can accurately or successfully explain the conflicting passions of contrasting religious faiths remains questionable, Peters deserves credit for this impressive achievement. In part due to the critical nature of the issues that he addresses, we give his work a high recommendation.	2003-10-15

Nobel Prize-winning economic scientist Amartya Sen attempts to popularize a series of lectures he presented to executives at the World Bank in 1996. He challenges traditional economic theories to justify a more aggressive, humane and generous funding formula to benefit the world's poorest nations. This goal is based on his theory about individual capabilities and functionings, and how they affect opportunity, both person by person and in a society. Even though this is aimed for general discussion rather than Ph.D. course work, it is an extremely daunting book to read, a mental maze land mined with quirky thoughts and a thick lexicon only an academic could love. More thesis than not, the text is 298 pages plus 60 pages of small type footnotes. The short version: the rich get richer and the poor remain deprived of abilities and awaiting enlightened development. We recommend this dense, challenging but, as they say, important book to insomniacs, liberal world bankers, economic policy makers, the Kofi Annan fan club and students of economic science.	2003-10-15

This lengthy philosophical treatise from the editor-in-chief of The Economist wanders all over recent history and offers some cautious, well-hedged ruminations about the shape of things to come. It's a pleasure to read, like lounging in a posh boat and drifting down a slow river of thought. The current of thought is almost directionless. Emmott shifts from subject to subject, time period to time period, perspective to perspective easily, with no restraint. He has a little pro-Americanism here, a little underestimating of the Chinese there, but nothing sharp-edged. Readers looking for a succinct point of view will be disappointed; so will those seeking fresh, new ideas. But we understand that those who enjoy considering and decoding the complex web of political and economic forces will be delighted.	2003-10-15

Mary Lou Quinlan interviewed 3,000 women consumers about their desires and buying habits. When you finish her book, you will actually be able to answer the question, \\"What do women want?\\" Quinlan's style is direct and personable. She backs up her arguments with quotes from successful CEOs and marketers and with a smattering of do's and don'ts from the world of advertising. The book has heart - after all, Quinlan maintains that for women, business is personal - as well as practical advice, although you may have to dig for it. She provides a lot of information on broad thematic lines, sometimes making it tricky to sort out strategies from stories. This is less of a textbook than Marketing to Women (by Martha Barletta from Dearborn Trade Publishing); it is more research-based and extends beyond communications into comparable hands-on, practical counsel. We suggest this wakeup call about the buying power of women to professionals in marketing, advertising, sales and customer service. Use this primer to decode those mixed signals you've been getting from women in your marketplace - and in your life.	2003-10-15

This book seems to have been written primarily because the author learned about the existence of boxes of Thomas Watson's papers that had never been read by any biographer or journalist. In some cases, the author's access to these new materials does help fill in some minor gaps in the existing accounts of Watson's life. And cumulatively, they take some of the shine off the legend, impressing upon one how humdrum the daily life of even a business titan must be. This book is reasonably well written and packed with memorable anecdotes. While it doesn't offer stunning new insights, we commend it as a readable, accessible and balanced introduction to one of the greatest executives of the twentieth century.	2003-10-15

Perhaps the greatest tribute to the work of author Roy Jenkins is that, at times, he seemed to know what Winston Churchill was actually thinking - and you're pretty sure he's right. When the mind you're reading about belongs to perhaps the greatest Prime Minister in the history of Great Britain, Nobel-prize winner Winston Churchill, that is a pretty impressive accomplishment. Jenkins' biography is essentially unsentimental, and reveals Churchill's idiosyncrasies and errors in an honest manner that serves only to elevate, rather than tarnish, the legacy of the man who rallied the free world to resist the tyranny of National Socialism. Jenkins has written an extraordinary volume which we highly recommend to any student of history.	2003-10-14

A book that has been continuously in print for nearly 70 years obviously has timeless relevance. The principles of value investing, spelled out for the first time in Security Analysis by Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd, have made fortunes for investors since it was first published in 1934. For example, Warren Buffett calls this book his Bible. Much has changed on Wall Street since the 1930s, but the concept of buying undervalued companies has not. In addition to its lucid explanation of investment basics, the book is a fascinating picture of a time when the lessons of the Great Depression were still being absorbed. The Securities Act of 1933 had just changed the rules of financial disclosure, and most public companies were manufacturers, mines, railroads or utilities - not the makeup of today's blue-chip portfolio. We recommend this book to serious investors who want to cut through modern Wall Street jargon, and to students of financial history.	2003-10-14

In Just for Fun, Linus Torvalds, the Finnish creator of the Linux operating system, mixes his personal story, told in both narrative and e-mail dispatches, with the saga of his development of the Linux operating system. Torvalds' personal account makes the book fascinating. He began as a self-proclaimed nerd (and even a jerk) who labored to create an operating system in his garage and eventually became the head of the world's largest open source project. By requiring buyers and licensees to keep the Linux source code open, Torvalds assures the continued technological evolution of his system. The episodic nature of the book makes it choppy, the technical descriptions are hard for the uninitiated to track and co-writer David Diamond's digressions are revealing about Torvalds' personal life, but a little disruptive. Even so, we recommend this entertaining, interesting book that may even lead you to consider using Linux on your computer, whether or not you are another self-proclaimed computer nerd.	2003-10-14

This is a comprehensive guide to identifying and developing future leaders. The authors present an exhaustive (sometimes exhausting) explanation of a program called \\"Acceleration Pooling\\" - a fancy collective name for grouping everyone in your firm who has the potential to lead. Much of the content seems like common sense, yet, organizations harried by short-term challenges can easily neglect long-term tasks, such as leadership development. This carefully planned, meticulously documented approach may keep organizations from neglecting the future. Despite its turgid, jargon-choked style, this book may fill the need. Time-pressed managers can glean the most important points quickly from chapters 2, 6 and 16, which have some solid gold principles of succession planning. Human Resource managers will want to delve into the other chapters. The authors, who are consultants, make a strong case for hiring consultants to implement this system, and have registered, copyrighted, service marked and/or trademarked every form and bit of terminology that could possibly be protected. We note that many of these leadership building methods, tools and techniques are in the public domain, in case you want to do-it-yourself, using this guide book.	2003-10-14

George Eckes has written a concise, thorough introduction to the theory and practice of Six Sigma, the management philosophy that Jack Welch called the most important initiative of his entire career at General Electric. The book provides a look at every aspect of Six Sigma. In some places, it seems a bit too detailed for so short a book - particularly when the author introduces the variety of statistical charts, graphs and tables used in the analysis phase of Six Sigma. But that is a quibble. Eckes also gets a bit self-serving when, in the question and answer chapter, he takes a swipe at consultants who agree to work on a contingency basis, for a percentage of the savings a client achieves, instead of for a fee. In fact, where we are always glad to avoid a squabble, notes that managers who use this book may achieve some level of business improvement without hiring any consultants at all.	2003-10-14

Stephan Schiffman, who has trained more than 450,000 salespeople, expands upon an approach he used in an earlier book about crafting sales proposals that make sense to your prospects. He stresses the need to listen so you can respond to the customer's needs, rather than just trying to convince the prospect to buy. Some of this book may give you a sense of deja vu if you've read any of his previous sales books, such as Power Sales Presentations. Otherwise, this is a fairly solid, sensible, no gimmicks approach to sales. Schiffman includes effective hands-on examples of sales approaches, including cold calling scripts and an appendix of sample dialogues. He teaches selling methods to use in different corporate settings, such as presenting to committees.  We find the book's 30 short snappy chapters ideal for reading in concise, instructive bites, just right for busy sales people	2003-10-14

The Cluetrain Manifesto was one of the seminal books of the dot.com bubble era, but reading it now is like waking with a hangover and looking at all of the empty bottles, each of which seemed like a great idea at the time. The Internet changed everything, all right. Those who can bite back the irony long enough to see the big picture and keep reading will find some valuable practical advice on using the now-not-so-new-technology of the Web to do business more effectively. We recommend this pivotal book for the sake of your sense of perspective (or to give you a critically necessary background if you are too young to remember when Amazon was just a river.)	2003-10-14

Author Adam Morgan went hunting for the second most successful brands. He sought commonalities among them to develop guidelines for those who are challenging the number one brands in their fields. In other words, if you are coming into the battle in the number two slot, here's your strategy for winning the marketing wars. Morgan is very adept at breaking things down into precise action steps. Witty and engaging, he offers a detailed analysis of the current consumer attitude about brands plus strategies you can use to market your second or third rank brand.

In Delivering Knock Your Socks Off Service, Performance Research Associates - with some editorial help from Ron Zemke - highlight the main principles and techniques involved in providing great customer service and resolving customer problems. This lively book features many short chapters, cartoons, bulleted axioms and what-to-do examples. However, much of the information seems very familiar, like a juiced-up version of hints, tips and advice that have appeared in many other customer service books. Thus, it has a kind of dj vu quality. While someone who is experienced in this field may find the information here too familiar, we recommend this accessible volume as a great introduction to customer service.	2003-10-14

To boost your sales group's performance, give your salespeople very specific assessments and instructions, as per authors Andris A. Zoltners, Prabhakant Sinha and Greggor A. Zoltners. The trouble here is that the instructions are not only detailed, they are highly technical. You have to see sales as a science to make the best use of the graphs, charts, lists, diagrams and formulas. If you can make your way through the academic writing, you'll find some useful hard data, such as statistical evidence that backs the need for precise sales performance assessments. Despite its lengthy retelling of some very basic sales principles, we recommend this manual to the audience its authors suggest, \\"sales managers, top managers, salespeople who want to advance professionally, divisional presidents and business owners\\" plus business school students. If you're going to be academic, you might as well learn something.	2003-10-14

Warren Bennis and Patricia Ward Biederman describe the qualities that generate \\"Great Groups,\\" capable of meaningful creative collaborations. Despite the myth of individual achievement and heroic leadership, the authors delve into major breakthroughs accomplished by group effort. Often Great Groups unite around the vision of a charismatic leader and work toward that leader's goal with obsessive commitment. Bennis and Biederman spend much of the book describing the workings of a half dozen such groups - from the Manhattan project to the founders of the Disney Studio to Bill Clinton's campaign team. These case histories read like individual short stories, but they each tell the saga of a driven creative collaboration. The authors conclude with lessons you can apply to bring the dedication of Great Groups to bear within your organization. We recommend this clearly written, logically organized book to leaders and collaborators in any industry, with two caveats. First, acquiring the requisite charisma is up to you. And, second, as to the authors' fulsome praise of obsessive work habits, well, that's so `90s.	2003-10-14

Just when you thought you had this marketing thing down, Mark Earls says it won't do you any good now. Marketing is out of sync with today's consumer-centric world of empowered customers and excess supply. In witty prose, Earls contends that creativity is more than catchy words, and he has plenty to say about the brand-as-experience phenomenon and about freeing yourself from convention. His sensible premise comes across as simplistic and naïve. Saying that ideas are the key to success is a bit like saying that love conquers all - a noble sentiment, but vague and not really new. However, this doesn't pretend to be a how-to book; it's an idea book, and you interpret the ideas. An ad veteran, Earls provides ample examples and expert quotes on attitudes and behaviors. And if it isn't news that the market changes constantly, we note, it isn't fully understood either. If you want to understand, welcome to Earls' world.	2003-10-14

If you've wondered what's behind Southwest Airlines' uncommon success, wonder no more. Author Jody Hoffer Gittell lays it all out in The Southwest Airlines Way. Gittel, a university professor, explains that at Southwest Airlines, relationship building and collaboration aren't just given lip service - they're a condition of employment. This is an excellent case study of the airline and its competitors, wherein Gittell reveals the characteristics that make Southwest shine, traits other airlines have tried hard to emulate. She makes a compelling case for the power of relationships inside, outside and at all levels of the corporate hierarchy. Meticulously researched and offering abundant industry testimonials, this corporate exploration doesn't feel like yet another marketing book. We think this excellent exposition is just the ticket for corporate leaders who want to know not just how Southwest did it, but how they can do it too.	2003-10-14

Tales. Offering another finny fable, Stephen C. Lundin, John Christensen and Harry Paul present a business parable based on creating and sustaining successful change. The book uses the same fictitious approach as the other two Fish!ing trips, but this time the story is set at a hospital's nursing station. The agent-of-change head nurse has departed and the new head nurse feels that the group is losing its vision. Then, she discovers that a local sushi restaurant is a model of excellence, and all goes swimmingly after that. Although the advice offered isn't particularly unique, some may find a certain charm in the story. Given that this is round three, the format may seem a little repetitive to those who have already Fish!ed. If you want to catch the core of the message on your first cast, look for the highlights on the occasional pages in whale-size type. We recommend the basic common sense of these messages, even if the storytelling is a little fishy.	2003-10-14

Peter Burrows offers insights into high level business, where personality matters more than economics, as he explores the mammoth HP-Compaq merger. Most mergers fail to make money or to produce the promised \\"synergies\\" so, he asks, why - other than ego - do CEOs pursue them? Though stylistically somewhat trite, this book successfully explores the HP Board's decision to approve the merger, with Walter B. Hewlett's vote in favor, and his subsequent lonely, ultimately quixotic battle against it. The most contentious issues in contemporary business are all here: shareholder rights and value vs. CEO power; employee-oriented cultures vs. \\"re-engineering;\\" corporate integrity vs. sharp practice; and the interesting spectacle of a ruthless, hard-headed female CEO pitted against a sensitive, cello-playing man. The author says Hewlett-Packard executives were told not to speak with him after he quoted merger critics in Business Week, so there is an inevitable Walter Hewlett bias. We found this to be a very good read, even a must read, for corporate warriors.	2003-10-14

During the collapse of the so-called Internet bubble, the legendary Dutch fiscal intoxication with tulips, called tulipmania, was widely cited as a lesson from history. The financial press hyped stories of deluded Dutch farmers who mortgaged all their worldly possessions to purchase a single prize tulip bulb, only to meet financial ruin when the bubble inevitably burst. Economist Peter M. Garber dug into history, and found that most of the common wisdom about the tulipmania was false. So, if you ever wondered how Dutch investors could have been so foolish, there is a simple answer: they weren't. Famous First Bubbles clearly evolved from a series of academic papers but, nonetheless, the book is entertaining. The primary focus on the tulip bubble makes the sections on the Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles seem like afterthoughts. We from getAbstract recommend this to iconoclasts who enjoy debunking historical legends and to bubble watchers everywhere.	2003-05-05

In Sales Don't Just Happen, Stephan Schiffman, the founder of a fast-growing sales training company, expands on his approach to selling based on developing a proposal that makes sense to the prospect. He fills his book with discussions of the same basic principles he has presented in several other books, though each has its own emphasis, such as cold calling or making a more effective close. Here Schiffman ranges through the four key phases of the sales cycle - prospecting, interviewing, presentation and close - to teach 26 strategies (one main technique per chapter) that push a sale forward. At the end of each chapter, he summarizes how to apply that chapter's tips. These methods are generally quite useful, though familiar, basic approaches. One warning: if you've read Schiffman's other sales books, you may experience a sense of dj vu. But otherwise, we from getAbstract recommend this solid manual to any corporate sales rep who makes in-person presentations in quest of large sales.	2003-05-05

Bechet provides a comprehensive guide to planning your staffing. He includes a CD with PowerPoint slide presentations, adaptable Excel spreadsheets, and assessment and evaluation forms. The book has ample examples and case studies of how to set up staffing, and tons of charts, graphs and formulas. But, you cannot apply his models and practices without this detailed hands-on workbook of his scorecard strategy, where you enter relevant data in a matrix that provides staffing direction. Warning: if your basic assumptions are wrong or if your situation changes quickly, you could take a wrong turn, so proceed carefully. While this is not a fun read - in fact, it can seem convoluted - Bechet's intent is practicality, not recreation. This is a hardcore resource for hiring decision-makers. So we from getAbstract suggest that you pour yourself a stiff cup of coffee, grab a thick notepad and muscle up to the staffing task with serious, strategic intent.	2003-05-05

Economist Robert Shiller became a household name when he published his previous bestseller Irrational Exuberance just as the dot.com boom was peaking. In The New Financial Order, he capitalizes on his celebrity to put forward a thoughtful, detailed proposal for managing economic risks. This highly readable book portrays a future in which many serious individual financial risks are dispersed to savvy global investors, thanks to technology. Imagine violinists being able to insure their careers in addition to their Stradivarius instruments, developing countries securing generous loans from the first world by tying the repayment schedules to their future GDPs and a revamped tax system preventing the gap between rich and poor from widening. We from getAbstract suggest this book to risk-management professionals who want to step back and look at the big picture, as well as to anyone who has a stake in creating new financial products to meet twenty-first century needs.	2003-05-05

If you say po-tay-toe, and they say po-tah-toe, you say to-may-toe and they say to-mah-toe, you can work the whole thing out. Just ask Michael Watkins, Harvard associate professor and author of this solid primer on how to conduct effective negotiations. While \\"breakthrough\\" may seem like a title marketing pitch, since many of these techniques have been covered in other books, he organizes the material thoughtfully. Watkins emphasizes multi-party negotiating, examining the power of coalitions. He diagnoses the external and situational factors that shape even two-party negotiations and provides helpful examples, diagrams and lists. His clear interesting style is a big improvement over most ponderous academic tomes on negotiations. To get the most out of this volume, really read it, and then practice the techniques. getAbstract's  position is clear: business managers, dispute resolution professionals and anyone facing multi-party negotiations should bring this to the table.	2003-04-29

Customer Management of Relationships (CMR) is not a tactic or gimmick - it's a new way of looking at your business. Author Frederick Newell promises that CMR will put your customers where they should be: at the forefront of your company's efforts. Newell, an international marketing consultant and leading Customer Relationship Management (CRM) authority, explains that a strong relationship with customers is essential to success. Although his book is unnecessarily repetitive at times and poorly organized, he provides excellent advice for companies already on the road to improving their customer interactions. Valuable testimony from experts accompanies numerous case studies. Whether you took a ride on the CRM train, or not, if you want better customer relationships for your business, we from getAbstract thinks this book may be your ticket.	2003-04-29

Then you need Kerry Patterson and his co-writers, who describe techniques for effective negotiation and conflict resolution in the context of important, potentially life-changing conversations. Examples include talking yourself into a promotion, bringing up important information at meetings and working out problems with your spouse. Some tips will sound familiar, such as knowing what you really want and being open to alternatives. However, the book also highlights some themes that are often forgotten in negotiations, such as making it safe for others to express their true feelings and desires. The authors explain how to avoid getting forced into false either-or choices and tell you how to remain alert for unstated alternatives or possibilities. This lively book includes many examples drawn from business and personal relationships. We from getAbstract recommend it in particular to those are new to negotiations and conflict resolution, though it teaches solid skills that any manager - or any marriage partner, for that matter - could benefit from mastering.	2003-04-29

Planning a corporate party or special event? Don't lift a finger until you've read The Business of Event Planning. In this highly practical book, author Judy Allen covers every aspect of the process in exhaustive detail. Allen, an author, writer and experienced event planner, contends that events are more than just feel-good activities. Events, she says, must be staged as strategic tools with return-on-investment potential. If you want to know how, she covers all the basics. Even though the book is geared toward large events, the principles can be applied to functions of any size. Allen includes details of proposal writing, itineraries, contract negotiations, fee setting, high tech applications and security concerns in a post-September-11 world. We from getAbstract recommend this logistical guide to corporate staffers or event planners who want to master the fine details.	2003-04-29

Author Gerald Kraines addresses a neglected area of management and lays out practical, important prescriptions for turning accountability into a linchpin of a thriving organization. Unfortunately, his solid counsel reads like an especially turgid graduate-level textbook. While all the ideas in this book are useful and many are extremely valuable, they're obscured by the heavy use of jargon (much of it self-defined, so the book often seems to be written in its own unique language). As a result, even though it is only some 220 pages, readers may give up, defeated by stretches of nearly impenetrable text. Kraines, who builds on the work of Elliott Jaques, tries to open doors with accessible case studies, but he soon lapses back into his specialized vocabulary. As a result, we from getAbstract believe the full text will interest mainly a very specific audience: business students and professors, theorists, consultants and high-level managers at large organizations may want to look up particular chapters for details and context. Even if you don't have the stamina for the whole tome, hang in there for the gems.	2003-04-29

Roger Bean and Russell Radford examine the history of innovation for ways that your organization can innovate continually. They ask why companies successfully innovate for a while and then lose steam. Their answer is a new organization-wide system that prioritizes innovation, management and strategy. This fairly academic structure - more like a proposal than a working process - encourages building systemic promotion of continual innovation by creating an environment that values, nurtures and encourages it, cascading from the executive to the managerial to the operational team level. However, toward the end of the book, the authors refer to using a Balanced Scorecard for assessing performance from a total quality perspective. That approach bypasses the inspirational, charismatic form of innovation and cuts right to the process, like an accountant or an engineer's model of innovation. Thus, if you are process-savvy but hesitant about new ideas, we from getAbstract suggest that this might just be the innovation book for you: lots of system, not much flash.	2003-04-29

Partha Bose has crafted an impressive volume that stands equally well as a work of interpretive history or as a contemporary guide to effective business strategy. Like any lessons-of-history-applied-to-business volume, it works to find a delicate balance between past and present. Its practical business examples range from Honda to IBM to the war in Afghanistan (a land which Alexander was the last to conquer successfully). Fortunately, Bose avoids the temptation to give the facts of history short shrift. Do not expect to find an answer about whether to do that big acquisition deal. (You'll never establish your own business empire if you get too caught up in the details!) Instead, this volume brings to life the classic lessons of leadership that march across the eons, unstoppable, unchanging, unchallenged, like the Macedonian legion itself. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book to executives, strategists, history buffs and all those who harbor a secret desire to rule the world!	2003-04-29

Things are going swimmingly in Fish! land. In the latest volume, Fish! Tales, authors Stephen C. Lundin, John Christensen, Harry Paul and Philip Strand build on the successful training program that evolved from their first Fish book. Tales shows how four companies - a long-distance call center; a hospital neural-renal unit, a car dealership and a roofing company - have applied Fish! theories effectively. They also provide short examples from other companies to show how well the Fish! function. The four main principles are familiar by now - keep the work fun, seek to serve others, stay focused on your customers and have an enthusiastic attitude - but the examples in the book bring them alive. Along the way, the authors heavily sell their Fish! courses and merchandise - that's just good salesmanship - but the real catch of the day is the final how-to section, showing ways to apply these principles in any organization. The lively writing style helps keep you hooked. We from getAbstract suggest that if you haven't yet caught any Fish!, start with this one. Its cheery, accessible methods should lure you in, hook, line and sinker.	2003-04-29

E-learning expert Roger C. Schank describes the secrets of a good e-learning program. He emphasizes using e-learning to train in-house employees, although his methods could work in any setting. Schank clearly establishes the basic principle that makes e-learning work: learning by doing. He outlines methods using scenarios and simulations that permit the learner to put new ideas into practice immediately. He's a little too fond of failing and trying over as a learning method, when one might learn just as well by studying others' failures and successes. However, he supports his approach with education-based examples that demonstrate how children learn, along with an inside look at IBM and GE programs. Visuals in the book show the computer screen in a teaching mode as displayed to the user, so you see how your e-learning material should look, whether on a Web site or on a local intranet. We from getAbstract recommend this solid hands-on instruction manual for training and development managers, and for those who are building e-learning experiences.	2003-04-10

In The 12-Hour MBA Program, Milo Sobel presents an overview of the major topics graduate students learn in pursuit of a master's degree in business administration. He offers chapters on marketing and product management, accounting and finance, human resources and operations management, statistics, economics, technology management, business policy and ethics, strategic planning, education and career planning. This good, solidly written introduction to the field will probably be of most interest to college students and other beginners, who will benefit from this broad overview of different spheres of knowledge. However, managers and executives will find this too basic, more like a field of iceberg tips. The text is clearly written and well-organized, though it is primarily a summary, with a few examples and only occasional charts and tables. We from getAbstract recognize what this basic book is trying to accomplish, but warns that - having been written in 1993 - it's somewhat dated and lacks current thinking in such areas as marketing, management, leadership and strategy.	2003-04-10

A sentence crafter happily at work, James O'Laughlin imparts clarity with literacy. On the rare occasion that his industrious research does not find just the right quote from Buffett or Munger (chapters average 90 footnotes), he uses their favorite metaphors from sports and life. This is excellent writing that falls short only on prophesy and damnation. Buffett must pass Berkshire on to an heir in the next decade, but exactly who might follow him is given short shrift. How this unknown magician might cope with Munger (too old to be an heir) is avoided carefully. The manuscript was begun before September 11, 2001, created insurance chaos, but O'Laughlin doesn't elaborate upon it, beyond suggesting that chaos benefits Buffett - whose main float derives from super catastrophic insurance and reinsurance. We from getAbstract recommend this volume highly - along with getting to know the Real Buffett, you will learn a tidy amount about economics.	2003-04-10

If you've declared war on your company's lackluster performance, this book will help you launch an all-out assault. Leadership Lessons of the Navy Seals demonstrates through the experiences of this elite military unit of Sea, Air and Land commandos that combat lessons can apply to the corporate world. The book provides examples of SEAL tactics and missions, along with their corporate applications, particularly in strong team building. Authors Jeff Cannon and Lt. Cmdr. Jon Cannon combine their experience in business and the U.S. Navy in a no-nonsense, practical guide. They zero in on setting goals and commanding your troops with deadly accuracy. While their problem-solving text gets straight to the point, it isn't novel and they repeat lessons under different titles. The book is a laundry list, a useful approach in allowing you to choose what you need. We from getAbstract found that the Cannons fire off a good how-to book for corporate strategists who want to develop battle plans for improving their teams and organizations.	2003-04-10

When a wise old codger of rural roots warns you in humble fashion, \\"Pardon me, sir, but I dare say you're headed down the wrong road!\\" something tingling there on the back of your neck warns that you'd better listen. Even more so when the old-timer has risen beyond his oil-patch roots to become a Professor Emeritus at Princeton University. Kenneth S. Deffeyes doesn't have to impress anybody, and perhaps that's one reason he has written a book on oil that will never give you that scratchy sensation of wool being drawn over your eyes. Deffeyes returns to his Oklahoma City roots to point out, as any fellow atop a tractor or toting a pipe wrench might, that things just can't keep going up and up forever. The difference: Deffeyes has a lifetime of industry and academic experience behind him. So, how real is the coming energy shortage? Well, put it this way: we from getAbstract highly recommend this book only to those individuals and companies who rely on electricity or the internal combustion engine. Stone age denizens need not sign up.	2003-04-10

Jeffrey Krames' biography of current U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is laced with leadership advice and built on databases and clips. This short book, at last, places Rumsfeld's long career into a coherent framework. Probably to hit a wartime deadline, Krames based the text primarily on work published about Rummy over a 40-year period, and not on independent research. In fact, a disclaimer says the book has no endorsement or authorization from Rumsfeld or anyone around him. In the 1970s, Rumsfeld published a long list of bland but entertaining aphorisms under the title, \\"Rumsfeld's Rules.\\" Krames draws many of his leadership suggestions from that compilation. But the chronology about Rumsfeld's career dominates and fascinates. Rumsfeld is far more interesting than he seems, a much more potent and historic figure. For that reason, we from getAbstract recommend this book to corporate officers, journalists, news junkies, political operatives, disgruntled Saudis and all defense contractors.	2003-04-10

Dave Kahle adapts many now common time management processes for the specific use of salespeople in the field. His underlying assumption is that it is much more difficult for outside salespeople to apply the usual techniques, since their lives are so filled with uncertainty. Plus salespeople tend to be action-oriented, so they don't commonly want to spend time planning or setting up systems. But, Kahle argues, such organization is critical to success in sales. While Kahle claims that most time management principles and tactics \\"totally miss the unique challenges of the field salesperson,\\" the material he covers in the book sounds very familiar. It echoes many other books about goal setting, problem solving, decision making and effective selling. We from getAbstract find that while this may be a helpful review of fairly common material in the guise of time management, the information is hardly unique - although its focus on salespeople's needs may give it additional value for them.	2003-04-10

If you are, fear not. Author and marketing authority Jack Trout ? the man who ?positioned? positioning in the minds of marketers ? has planted a genie in a mysterious computer (the new age version of a bottle on the beach) and given him the task of answering core marketing questions. In this fictional tale ? which attempts to emulate the success of fables such as Who Moved My Cheese and Fish, but falls short ? Trout takes readers through the very basics, from defining the product?s concept to what elements should be in a logo. Trout warns of seven marketing pitfalls to avoid. Using everyday language and the persistent but wealthy genie who explains it all, he breaks down the subject into small nuggets easily digested by even the least marketing-minded manager. While he does oversimplify, Trout contends that marketing is often made more complicated by the very people who profit from its complexity. Overall, we from getAbstract suggest this how-to book to business people who are unfamiliar with the marketing process.	2003-04-10

McGraw, Ph.D., better known to Oprah Winfrey fans as Dr. Phil, has popped out a refreshingly in-your-face contribution to the self-help genre that doesn't beat around the bush. You will not be asked to commune with your inner child or vent your anger and pain. Instead, Life Strategies is a prescription for action, complete with stories, including about Oprah. Each chapter contains at least one writing assignment, designed to stimulate honest inquiry and to challenge even your most basic assumptions. These culminate in a meticulously detailed set of instructions for creating your life strategy. Organized self-starters will love the lists and matrices, but even readers who don't plunge into the assignments will gain fresh insights into their behavior. We from getAbstract prescribe this bouncy book to anyone seeking a step-by-step plan for self-assessment and realistic life change. Cynics need not apply.	2003-04-10

It is not really a story about two buddies who lunch together while they pursue management success - that's just the framework. It is not a book on how to implement Six Sigma - although it would prove a useful adjunct to any such program. Nor is it one of those books filled with consultant-ese whose primary function seems to be to advertise: \\"You need to hire me to help you to dispel the confusion that my book just generated.\\" This is actually a very down-to-earth introduction to the quality enhancement strategy that is continuing to transform the corporate world. Frustrated onlookers may believe that practitioners keep the practical meaning of Six Sigma hidden, like some secret magic potion, but this powerful little book blows the lid off the caldron. Written as a lunchroom dialogue between friends, it's as user-friendly as it is insightful. We from getAbstract highly recommend this manual to anyone at any level involved, or becoming involved, with Six Sigma.	2003-04-10

If you ever wanted to belly up to the bar with a foreign correspondent, share a cold beer and swap war stories, this is your chance. Daniel Litvin, a former journalist, as well as a former corporate social responsibility (CSR) officer, shares a book full of corporate adventures from the foreign battlefields of business. In this very anecdotal examination of how the arrival of first world companies affects local societies and governments - for good or ill - in third world countries, he sews stories and history together from India to Guatemala to Iran to Manchuria to Africa. He lists the past misdeed of Aramco oil companies in Arabia, of Shell in Nigeria and of Nike's far flung contractors, seeming to say that they meant no real harm and did less harm than they were accused of doing, but he also contrasts the flawed past with the improved present. Even with responsible policies, he says, multinationals most often fail because they create unexpected dynamics and impossible expectations. We from getAbstract recommend this fiscal, social and corporate travelogue to executives, corporate social responsibility officers and field personnel far from home.	2003-04-10

Waite is a Wall Street veteran, but despite its title Quantum Investing is not about investing (the few investor-oriented tips are at the end of each chapter and at the book's conclusion). Rather, it is a futurist manifesto, an infectious, heady hodgepodge of science textbook and thought experiment, which reads like a sequel to Future Shock. Waite takes you on a whirlwind tour of quantum theory, which has enabled astounding technological advances (note the glossary of physics terms and the timeline of relevant scientific developments). He assesses the accounting industry as hopelessly out-of-date when it comes to valuing intangible assets, and offers a thought-provoking discussion of the stock market, chaos theory and complex systems. You'll probably be skeptical of - but intrigued by - the discoveries he predicts for the twenty-first century. We from getAbstract recommend this to executives who are interested in a big-picture treatment of the economic evolution, or who are science (or science-fiction) buffs.	2003-04-10

Jac Fitz-enz presents a breakthrough approach to measuring your return on investment (ROI) in human capital. This book could have been dull, dry and dusty in someone else's hands, but instead is absorbing and a pleasure to read. Using studies done by the Saratoga Institute - his own facility - and drawing upon the work of other researchers as well, the author places this new methodology in the context of today's business challenges, including e-commerce. He pinpoints satisfaction as the baseline value employees pursue, and shows how you will profit by working toward employee fulfillment. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book to those in human resources, and to managers, executives and entrepreneurs who run their own businesses.	2003-03-18

Nina Eliasoph describes the ways that volunteers get involved - or don't get involved - in political activity. Most volunteers, she notes, intentionally shy away from discussing the core political issues related to their volunteer efforts. She suggests that these volunteers have learned apathy in order to avoid the confrontation that public political debate might provoke. The volunteers she studied are willing to raise difficult issues in private, but not in public. Instead of finding - as might be expected - that joining groups helps people become activists, she finds the opposite. Group membership seems to blunt personal action. Eliasoph can be academic and repetitious, in that she uses multiple examples to make a  single point. So, while respecting her research and her passion, we from getAbstract suggest this book is primarily aimed at political scientists and at readers who are truly concerned that more institutions should foster public debate and more of us should engage in it. The author is deeply worried about apathy's effect on democracy. The question is, do you care?	2003-03-18

Authors Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema make it clear that market leading companies all concentrate on creating value for their customers. Then they focus on specific cases from Nike to Johnson &amp; Johnson. No company, including yours, can succeed by trying to be all things to all people. Companies must ascertain the unique value - be it price, quality or problem solving - they can deliver to a specific market. The book proves that comparisons are not odious if they are interesting, and the comparisons it offers are intriguing indeed. Anecdotes and case histories cover companies that are market leaders today - AT&amp;T, Intel, Airborne Express - and companies that used to be market leaders. The authors offer you three choices: lead with low costs, great products or outstanding ability to solve customers' problems. But if you are going to lead, you have to pick a direction and implement a management strategy that supports it, a lesson eased along by the clarity of the writing. We from getAbstract recommend this book to executives who are seeking advice on trumping their markets.	2003-03-18

Many of the ideas in \\"bodacious\\" will sound familiar, since Mary Foley is advising women to be more assertive, strategic, competitive and political. It's the formula men have long used to get ahead, but Foley addresses her counsel directly to women, along with tips on how to overcome traditional ideals about acting feminine. Hardnosed or not, Foley writes in an engaging way, as she combines personal growth suggestions with examples from success stories, including her own. After a ten year career starting as a customer service rep, she became an AOL millionaire and retired. Now an author, speaker and personal coach, she dispenses advice in a catchy, casual style, which makes even familiar suggestions interesting. While some men may find it interesting to eavesdrop on these lists and reminders for women in the workplace, we from getAbstract recommend Foley's breezy career boost to women white collar and professional employees who are ready to pump up on pep talk.	2003-03-12

This is a new edition of Milton Friedman's classic 1962 capitalist manifesto. As such, it was ignored, spurned and hated for decades by the intellectual, post-Keynesian establishment. In the 60s, Friedman once found himself debating a liberal who attacked him by simply reciting Friedman's views of the proper role of government. This was working rather well with the audience of college students until he quoted Friedman's opposition to the military draft. Friedman suddenly found himself awash in the unexpected cheers of students. Perhaps it was a foreshadowing of his career. Friedman won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976, and his ideas gained some degree of mainstream acceptance in the Reagan years - although many of his thoughts remain controversial. To the extent that Friedman debunks myths about the Great Depression that are widely accepted as fact, perhaps he has a point about the semi-privatization of education. We from getAbstract strongly recommend this volume to those who seek a deeper understanding of government's role in a free-market economy.	2003-03-12

Author Norman R. Howes tackles project management in all its intricate bureaucratic glory, and brings the process up-to-date in what is essentially a book of instructions. Helpful in designing and tracking projects, this clear, crisp manual comes with Modern Project software, the program used to carry out the project management steps delineated in the book. The book, like any owner's manual, is very list-oriented. Howes does not teach you how to manage a project, either practically or theoretically, as much as he outlines the managerial process. His step-by-step guide focuses on detailed information telling readers how to take advantage of the software as they manage projects. While we from getAbstract recommend this guide specifically to project managers - who should keep it on hand, particularly if they use the related software package or want to learn more about it - the book is also designed to be used in corporate training programs and college classes.	2003-03-12

Kate Wendleton, an authority on job searches and career development, discusses techniques for getting interviews once you focus on your target job market. After a brief overview of the job-hunting process, she explains how to obtain interviews by networking effectively and building relationships. She discusses how to do mailings, answer ads, use interviews productively, work with search firms, develop phone skills and create a well-organized campaign. The book suffers from some repetition among chapters and some overlap with Wendleton's Building a Great Resume, especially in the beginning of both books. Great Resume offers more information about assessing your career path than the present volume, a solid, basic book apparently geared to the relatively inexperienced job hunter seeking a novice to mid-level position. We from getAbstract recommend the book's well-organized strategic overview to most job seekers, with the caveat that high level executives and managers may already know much of the material.	2003-03-12

Like any compendium whose chapters were written by different experts, The Biology of Business has its ups and downs. As a collection of ten deeply informed essays on complexity theory management, its voices vary. But when you're in the perilous business of trying to predict just where the cutting-edge of technology will cut next, is that really a bad thing? The diversity and scope - what is now fashionably called \\"bandwidth\\" - of this volume surely could not be matched by any single author's work. As you read through topics as diverse as law, marketing, nurturing start-ups and the application of advanced biological concepts to management, you will indeed find yourself challenged to adapt. That's as it should be. Reading this book may change the way you perceive your business. As the biological paradigm continues to spread through consultants' minds like a complex adaptive mold spore, we from getAbstract strongly recommend this sophisticated book to help you stay au currant.	2003-03-12

Organizational consultants Catherine Fitzgerald and Jennifer Garvey Berger offer a collection of articles by 16 executive coaches, including themselves. The essays cover executive coaching perspectives, practices and management. This book examines the range of managerial and psychological approaches shaping this emerging field. These expert articles provide a diverse overview, varying in complexity, practicality and therapeutic philosophies. The hazard of anthologies is the mix of voices, so there is some blurring between what is coaching and what is therapy, and some drift about exactly who is being spoken to, the coach, the manager or the executive. The book seems to focus primarily on the analytical, psychological and tactical tasks of coaches. However, we from getAbstract suggest that if you are hiring a coach for yourself or your organization, you may find this very practical in understanding what coaches do and in being sure you select a good one.	2003-03-12

If you think story-telling is just for little kids, three experts - psychologist Julie Allan, biochemist Gerard Fairtlough and consultant Barbara Heinzen - disagree. They have discovered significant value in story-telling within organizations. After briefly describing the multi-cultural history of stories and oral traditions, they dissect the purposes of story-telling, such as increasing rapport, appealing to the emotions and explaining situations. They use seven composite company case studies to demonstrate how stories can build truth and trust, promote learning, develop skills, break new ground and create scenarios you can use in planning the future. These well-intended examples tend to meander confusingly, but you'll get the point. The last section of the book is devoted to thinking about stories and their uses, an innovative subject that gets little general attention and is the real meat of the text. While the book is very informative and useful, it is not always clear about the purposes of particular stories. We from getAbstract found many helpful lessons about story-telling here, including, unfortunately, a demonstration of the need for sharp editing.	2003-03-05

Nationally-syndicated columnist and career expert Kate Wendleton zeroes in on the most effective approaches to resume writing, beginning with developing a compelling statement of your accomplishments. She explains how to show the results of your work, outline the benefits you bring prospective employers and present your strong points effectively. She includes exercises to guide your deliberative process, plus before-and-after resume samples. These makeovers demonstrate how you can turn a routine resume into an interview-generating powerhouse. Much of the book is taken up with sample resumes, which are helpful models for writing yours though they may be pretty dull to read. In addition, Wendleton also provides specific tips on how to phrase and design your resume. While recommending this manual to job hunters, we from getAbstract have determined that if you read these hints carefully, you can just skim the examples until you find one that meets your needs. Wendleton - and you may well say `thank you' here - both shows and tells.	2003-03-05

Some books set out to accomplish the impossible and come admirably close. Barbara Garson's volume is a prime example. Can you deposit money in a little rural bank and really trace its spread across the global monetary system? How do you know that a multi-million dollar loan to, say, shrimp exporters in Thailand, really has anything to do with the actual dollars you deposited? But that's not the point of this book. The author embarks on a whirlwind, worldwide tour of the global financial juggernaut, and shows how money falls like a drop in a pond and emits waves of disruption that seemingly spread out forever. Garson concludes that deregulation needs to be reigned in, a reasonable anticipation of the Enron mess. We from getAbstract highly recommend her book to business people and consumers who want a better feel for what the \\"global economic order\\" is all about, why people are protesting at each meeting of the WTO and whether you should be steamed as well.	2003-03-05

When it comes to the consulting business, Alan Weiss has been there, done that and probably consulted for the T-shirt company that sold you the T-shirt. So what does a consultant do when he's mastered the consulting business? Why, he becomes a consultant to consultants of course. Weiss has perfected his craft. His book takes you into the buyer's office, a rarified atmosphere where being too anxious to please can cost you business fast. Weiss has an instinctive understanding of the relationship between prospect and consultant, and an uncanny ability to communicate it. He makes you feel empowered to strike out and start your own seven-figure consultancy - except you'd be competing against the likes of Alan Weiss. We from getAbstract strongly recommend his book to both veteran consultants and neophytes.	2003-03-05

If you spent months in Paraguay or Latvia longing for modern supermarkets, octo-plex movie theaters and mega-malls, coming home will surprise you. All that consumerism, all those different breakfast cereals, all that plenty and pizzazz may not play as well with you as you had remembered. Never mind. Eventually youll again expect to be offered 15 different kinds of herbal tea with your $18 lunch, but when you first return and the deprivations of your overseas station are still fresh, reentry can include a big shot of culture shock. Companies pay plenty of attention to executives and workers who need help and advice when theyre given an overseas assignment. But Craig Storti thought it was time to address the needs of those same expats when they return and face the challenge of readjustment. He does so expertly in this practical guide, which includes hard logistics and some soft psychology. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book to homecoming expats and to those who play crucial roles in managing their reentries.	2003-03-05

One of the top experts in the field, Satya Dev Pradhuman has written an exhaustive study of small-cap investing. While this textbook-style exploration is hardly the place to look for exciting prose, the author does a grand job of harvesting every minute detail of his subject matter, and includes not only the fundamentals, but plenty of practical advice, helpful charts and graphs. We from getAbstract recommend this book to all investors.	2003-03-05

What makes a brand become the stuff of legend? Author and consultant Laurence Vincent says it's the power of a good story. Vincent, whose specialty is forging alliances between consumer brands and entertainment properties, presents an interesting parallel between marketing and storytelling that makes sense in today's increasingly cluttered media environment. Vincent introduces you to the basics of myth and storytelling. He explains how these concepts apply to marketing strategy and offers plenty of real-world examples and case studies to illustrate his points. Except for predicting the coming integration of advertising and content (it's been around for decades), Vincent's book is full of fresh insight. We from getAbstract recommend this book to brand managers and marketing executives who want to learn how to turn their brands into powerful icons. Legendary Brands takes the reader step by step through the process - just like any good story.	2003-02-25

Nydell has recast this cross-cultural guide to getting along with Arabs in a new light in the midst of the war on terror. In so doing, she navigates sensitive territory, a no-man's land stuck between understanding another culture, and becoming an apologist for its negative behaviors. Properly executed, cross-cultural guides enhance one's awareness of the vast cultural gap between social norms and customs. Occasionally this volume lapses into cultural generalities, but that's inevitable when you're trying to explain norms of some 20 diverse Arab countries. Understanding Arabs will help you do just that, and although it may not shed a lot of light on the current conflict, it's very timely. We from getAbstract highly recommend it to anyone who wants a better understanding of Islam and Arabs. As Nydell says in her introduction, seeking understanding should not be confused with appeasement.	2003-02-25

Teresa Esser has provides an insightful collection of anecdotes, horror stories, case studies and advice from seasoned veterans of the dot-com boom. Though she admits she's not the entrepreneurial type, her marriage to a successful entrepreneur gives her a unique vantage point on the joys and frustrations of starting a high-tech company with little more than a dream. This fun, quick read contains valuable tips on hiring a good lawyer, pitching ideas to VCs and surviving both failure and success. Much of the advice is still practical, even though the Internet bubble has burst. However, some of the interviews retain a bit of the breathless hype of the days when anyone with a domain name could land first-round VC funding. We from getAbstract recommend this book to would-be entrepreneurs, especially corporate types who are thinking of launching their own companies, and to those who want a level-headed view of the mysterious workings of high-tech startups and their funding.	2003-02-25

Edward Deming could be called the Mozart of quality control, the Shakespeare of business consulting, the Michelangelo of management science. Deming is the sine qua non of modern business thought - the \\"without which not.\\" Perhaps more than any other thinker, he engineered the rise of Japanese competitiveness in the consumer goods sector, thereby giving a major prod to globalization. Perhaps his only failure was not envisioning the Big Brother extremes to which some would later push his ideas of \\"consistency of purpose\\" (for example, continuous quality improvement). Then again, prophets are plagued by their own disciples. Deming passes the test of time with flying colors. In this reprint of his 1986 classic, his eloquent arguments for single-supplier sourcing and leadership rather than supervision, and against production quotas and the absurd practice of MBWA (management by walking around), ring as true today as ever. We from getAbstract believe that classics should be revisited often, and highly recommends Deming's seminal work to thoughtful people in business at all levels.	2003-02-25

Jim Holden uses the metaphor of the Selling Fox to present ideas that will sharpen the skills of any competitive sales professional. Unlike many sales books, which have a \\"supervisory\\" voice, written from the perspective of someone who isn't actually battling away on the front lines, Holden writes about the reality of winning and keeping business. Foxes survive and thrive in an environment where another player is always scheming to steal their cheese, not move it. In fact, one unique aspect of this helpful guide is its practical advice on how to set traps for your competitors and take their clients away. That may not fit the rest of Holden's emphasis on integrity - but the law of the jungle is often what makes a sales professional a valued property. Maybe the fox analogy is overdone, but the phrase \\"super sales person\\" is even more careworn. We from getAbstract strongly recommend this book to those engaged in the noble business of selling, and to those who train them.	2003-02-25

Jim Vidakovich's Trainers in Motion is published in a binder with dividers, so you can add your own notes and comments. This reader participation workbook parallels Vidakovich's approach to involving participants in their own training. Vidakovich begins with an initial discussion of his approach, but the majority of the book is very hands-on, with descriptions of exercises, illustrations of room arrangements, lists of suggested approaches and questions for you to answer. This notebook is packed with good ideas from an expert on training. The caveat:...it's a little pricey. Nonetheless, we from getAbstract recommend it with confidence to trainers and workshop leaders. If hands-on is your style, you have a very well-informed friend in Jim Vidakovich.	2003-02-25

Krugman investigates the forces that drive economic growth and recession, and makes sense of several complicated issues. His ability to maintain the essence of a topic while simplifying complex economics with examples and analogies is a hallmark of his work. Despite the gloomy title, the book is not depressing because, Krugman concludes, another Great Depression is not looming in our future. Capitalism has, overall, provided the foundation for prosperity in advanced and developing economies alike. Indeed, the information age has introduced entrepreneurs who have generated wealth while becoming romantic heroes for succeeding in spite of giant corporations. However, Krugman stays alert for dark forces, warning us against panic attacks in the international financial markets, where multiplying negative feedback can overwhelm the effects of monetary policy. We from getAbstract recommend Krugman's in-depth analysis to anyone with an interest in world economics and financial markets.	2003-02-25

As with marriage, the success rate for global deal-making should give the wise investor pause. Most such mergers and acquisitions do not increase shareholder value. Even with the fallout from the burst bubble still landing all over the place, the juggernaut of globalization is such that international deals still manage to engender a lot of passion; it seems the grass is always greener on the other side of the border. Business leaders know that sometimes the riskiest move is the one they decide not to make, since a good strategic acquisition can ensure your company's survival. For these reasons, interest in cross-border transactions will probably remain strong, as industries consolidate and as global economic barriers collapse. However, deals that involve foreign accounting and legal practices can be absolutely perilous without expert professional guidance. This clearly written, thorough compilation can help you avoid making a bad decision and improve your odds of success. We from getAbstract strongly recommend it to anyone involved in (or considering getting involved in) global deal making.	2003-02-25

This is a concise, direct, very practical handbook for organizing a videoconference and communicating effectively on camera. The tips on organization, preparation and choosing the right medium for your meeting are especially helpful and new. Many tips, especially about grooming, makeup and clothing, are so simple they border on simplistic, but for those who have no experience in media or performing (such as corporate executives), these clues could make the difference between success and failure. Authors Janelle Barlow, Peta Peter and Lewis Barlow back up their pointers with real-life anecdotes which reinforce their ideas quite convincingly and provide the book its only real entertainment value; otherwise it's relentlessly practical. We from getAbstract found this book useful for anyone who is organizing or participating in a videoconference. When you're on the air, you want to be in the know.	2003-02-25

Stephan Schiffman's short to-the-point book features his new Prospect Management System, which is designed to help you become a more effective salesperson. This hearty addition to sales literature shows you how to be more systematic as you generate prospects and devote your attention to the ones who are most likely to buy. Instead of just playing a numbers game, Schiffman emphasizes ratios, so you can zero in on your best clients while developing new prospects - since only a few leads become sales. The book's charts and examples illustrate its principles, although the quizzes after each chapter seem unnecessary. If we were hawking this book, we from getAbstract would pitch it to those who sell big ticket items by developing leads through cold-calling.	2003-02-25

O'Byrne, management consultants who largely steer clear of their industry's usual empty catchphrases and superficial hype. Instead, their lucid explanation of the importance of shareholder value takes center stage. The heftiness of EVA and Value-Based Management may be daunting, but most readers will be satisfied with Part I's strategic overview. The concepts reappear in Part II accompanied by a wealth of technical details, calculations and case studies to help finance professionals with nitty-gritty implementation of EVA (Economic Value Added) programs. The book honestly assesses EVA's power to motivate managers, noting that some companies just are not well-suited for this performance metric. We from getAbstract prescribe this book to corporate executives who have overdosed on consultant jargon but still want to drive value growth in their companies, and to finance specialists who seek a comprehensive roadmap to EVA implementation.	2003-02-25

The advent of the publicly owned media conglomerate has left busy, multi-tasking reporters more dependent than ever on stories pitched by people, like you, who are looking for media placement. Full Frontal PR is an insider's look at how to make your story sing and dance in the mass media. The modern era requires hype, spin, guerilla marketing, buzz and hard core understanding of the media intake biz. The book's core lesson: how to get people to talk about you, your product and your service - the most important element in any PR campaign. Here's how to establish yourself as an expert source, so reporters get in the habit of calling you for quotes. Media veterans may have to dig for new ideas, but they are in here. However, we from getAbstract particularly suggest this manual of media manipulation to entry and mid-level PR managers who want to know more about creating that buzz.	2003-02-25

Everyone remembers the reaction when U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig took the podium at the White House the day John Hinckley shot President Ronald Reagan in 1981. \\"I'm in control here,\\" Haig tried to reassure the public, contrary to the constitutional rules of succession. The response was neither outrage nor reassurance that someone was taking the helm. Why? Harlan Cleveland thoughtfully suggests good reasons that the primary reaction to Haig's statement was bemusement tinged with ridicule. He makes an articulate argument that the era when anyone could be in complete control anywhere has long since passed. The reason? Systems have simply grown too complex to be managed by one individual. Thus, the best leader for the \\"Nobody's-In-Charge\\" society is someone comfortable with decentralization, someone who can arrive at resourceful, unusual solutions. By way of imprimatur, management guru Warren Bennis wrote this volume's foreword. We from getAbstract recommend this treatise to those who are seriously curious about the ways that technological and societal changes are altering the leader's role.	2003-02-25

They pay particular attention to factors that can help or hinder an expatriot's adjustment. Every chapter includes short, personal sidebars recounting the experiences of those who've lived and worked abroad, an addition which brings the book to life with insightful, useful and often hilarious detail. We from getAbstract recommend this book to anyone who is considering relocation to another country. To be at home anywhere on the globe, supplement it with a couple of books about the specific country where you are going. Pay attention to the advice about planning ahead, then get your shots, tuck your passport in your pocket and head for the airport.

As a consumer group, women represent an enormous opportunity, but chances are your company is missing out on them. Author Martha Barletta says most marketers fail to capitalize on this lucrative market. They don't realize its potential or understand fundamental gender differences. As a result, their marketing fails to communicate with women, let alone persuade them. Barletta, a consultant specializing in marketing to women consumers, offers a book heavy on theory and long on detail. Except for a few examples of how ads are executed, the book lacks case studies that would bring these theories to life. Still, Barletta provides good advice on practical applications of these ideas about gender culture. She sheds light on the myths and realities of marketing to women, and provides essays by female experts in the field. What a pity that it all reads like a textbook. Given that, we from getAbstract target this rather educational tome as more appropriate for people who study marketing than for people who do marketing, although thoughtful marketers might still want to take a look.	2003-01-21

Though the editors freely admit that business and war are different, and that mapping one to the other is a mistake, this book seems to be based on exactly that idea. After September 11, 2001, business-as-war metaphors seem overblown. Many in business have stopped looking at competition as a death struggle. Instead, they treat it as a mutual effort to foster growth in their sectors so everyone then benefits from the resulting synergies. That said, this compilation, which condenses sections of Prussian General Carl von Clausewitz's major work, On War, is well worth reading, though dense and sometimes difficult to follow. Clausewitz, a fascinating thinker, approaches his subject with wit and clarity. By his own description, his real contribution isn't his analysis, but the analytical method he applies to problems. We from getAbstract find his approach clearly relevant to anyone struggling against an intelligent and resourceful opponent, in business, politics or government, as well as to those pondering ways to go to war.	2003-01-21

Author Jake Bernstein puts an exclamation point in his title but fills his pages with abundant cautions, caveats and confessions. This is a voice deepened by an endearing hubris, a Dutch uncle lecturing his aspiring nephews on the dangers of speculation in futures, knowing the dumb ones should be appropriately daunted and the smart ones will hear his wily insinuations that this can actually be a very good thing, if they get it. If you are a successful securities investor thinking about speculating, this will make you keep your eggs in several baskets, even though the author shares hundreds of tips. If you wonder about the significance of puts and calls, hedges and options, this is a useful, precise and unambiguous lesson. Futures trading is not an investment; it is high risk speculation. Each trading strategy requires substantial time and money, and even the best fail half the time. We from getAbstract recommend this book to investors who need a Dutch uncle to quell their urge to risk their kids' college funds - first, listen to good old Uncle Jake.	2003-01-21

Jack Trout, head of the marketing firm Trout &amp; Partners, digs for details about the major reasons big brands run into trouble and just how enormous companies mess up by handling their signature standard-bearers badly. He runs down the litany: mistaken extensions of the brand name, failures to differentiate the brand's qualities and loss of clarity about just what a brand represents. His failure sagas are mini-novels based inside Xerox, General Motors, AT&amp;T, Digital Equipment, General Mills and Coca-Cola. Remember New Coke? Now that was a branding debacle. Trout highlights corporate shortcomings and lays the blame for branding woes right at the feet of people who should have known better: of out-of-touch CEOs, ineffective consultants and dysfunctional boards. Alert consumers who like insider business war stories will enjoy this clear, lively book, but if you own a company or market a brand, we from getAbstract suspect you should read it twice.	2003-01-21

Stephen Schiffman, one of the most renowned sales trainers, discusses how to assess your current performance and then increase your sales. If you've read Getting to Closed, skip the first section or just consider it a useful review. From Getting to Closed, you already know his techniques for tracking your numbers and understanding your ratios. He offers insight on how to move from initial contacts to prospects to sales and how to continually delve for new customers while working with your most promising leads. What really makes this book sing are the short, bite-sized chapters and concluding action items that help you implement and practice each axiom. Schiffman's succinct, breezy style makes this a quick, easy read. You'll also find his examples of phone conversations and responses helpful as a guide to adapt to your own situation. We from getAbstract leave this message: call Shiffman into action to increase your sales as you put these steps to work.	2003-01-09

W&ouml;ber and Daniel R. Fesenmaier present 40 papers from the International Conference on Information and Communication Technology in Tourism, now in its eighth year. At this conference, tourism and information technology (IT) experts, practitioners and researchers made presentations in 14 categories. Their research, which reflects their individual approaches, covers innovative IT solutions for tourism, knowledge management and change in the tourism industry, electronic communications, Internet marketing, business to business tourism, how consumers use destination web sites, intelligent recognition systems, tourism education and the hotel industry's IT challenge. These highly technical, sometimes even mathematical, articles are targeted to a specific market - those immersed in IT and tourism. We from getAbstract suggest this expert compilation to information officers, IT academics and tourism executives interested in IT for their companies. If you are interested, but not an insider, you'll like the chapter abstracts that summarize key articles (but, then again, we do have a soft spot for abstracts).	2003-01-09

In the mid-1980s, Warren Bennis wrote this classic model for modern leadership based on personal growth, self-expression, learning and integrity, drawing from interviews with dozens of leaders. Most importantly, he found, leaders do not seek to lead. Instead, they seek to express themselves fully. They embrace risks and mistakes, learning from adversity. They reflect on all of their experiences. With these skills, they inspire others to follow them. They turn organizations into communities which find each member's highest potential. Bennis falls into the one mistake he accuses American managers of making: he takes a poll (of successful leaders) and then gets caught in short-term thinking to address its results. As a result, this pessimistic analysis of American business is dated today. In the 21st century's light, some of his examples - i.e. the late Robert Maxwell and Apple Computer's John Sculley - seem quite dubious. However, we from getAbstract appreciate Bennis' basic, inspiring philosophy of leadership and so will you. Read this if you want to lead - and be good at it.	2003-01-09

Information technology (IT) fits the tourism industry like those three-fingered white gloves fit Mickey Mouse - but you have to really understand what you are doing if you want to hang out with the big thinkers. Just ask authors and researchers Hannes Werthner and Stefan Klein, specialists on IT applications for the tourism trade. They teach a complex class, here, about getting destination and attraction information to travelers and about getting tourism data back to service providers. This IT theme park is a place where insiders give the professional scoop to other insiders. The language is highly technical, theoretical and complex (perhaps, now and then, even more complex than the ideas at hand warrant). Casual visitors will like the extensive source documentation, charts, graphs and arrow-filled diagrams, but the text is written for folks who live in this industry day in and day out. If you already know info technology and tourism, we from getAbstract invite you to enjoy this expert rundown on how all the internal mysteries relate. There's nothing Mickey Mouse about it.	2003-01-09

University of Colorado-Denver management professor Wayne F. Cascio says your company will make more money during tough times if it finds a way to grow with its current employees instead of laying them off. Citing ample research (just see those careful footnotes and all those charts and graphs), he argues that it is simply good business to treat employees as assets to be developed, so they can help your organization reach its goals. If you downsize them out the door, you lose their expertise and commitment. Cascio cites companies that restructured successfully - Compaq, Cisco Systems, Sage Software - to illustrate different approaches. He wraps up with a critical bit of training: how to communicate internal information about the company's plans to restructure, always a touchy matter. We from getAbstract refer owners, top executives and human resource managers to this book because they will appreciate its combination of hard facts and how-to guidelines.	2003-01-09

Daniel Goleman followed up his bestselling classic Emotional Intelligence with this equally classic sequel that focuses on how emotional intelligence is applied in the workplace. Insightful and richly detailed, Goleman's work educates and inspires without ever sounding trite or sappy, like some annoying quick-fix scheme. If you are leadership bound and think success is all about strategy and technique, this will provide some very useful insights into what people really think about managing and being managed. The most intriguing sections focus on the application of emotional intelligence at work, but it would be pretty useful at home, too (if we could just get out of the office). If you think that you don't need to be more aware of the emotional undercurrents all around you, we from getAbstract warn that you need to read this most of all.	2003-01-09

Susan Antilla presents a powerful and startling indictment of the sexist behavior of stock brokers working for Wall Street and its offshoots, specifically Smith Barney's Shearson/American Express office in Garden City, Long Island. Women struggled to be hired, and then found that the men in charge of their careers practiced all sorts of sexual harassment and intimidation, from jokes to displays of sexual prowess, physical contact and threats of rape. As she describes, the bosses sought to bar women or trap them in low positions. While painting the broader picture, Antilla focuses on whistle blower, Pam Martens, who revealed the situation when she sued for damages. This skillfully written book reads like a fascinating novel, so graphic and dramatic that it is more like a screenplay than a report. We from getAbstract believe it will draw intense interest from everyone affected by this issue: female executives who face glass ceilings and harassment, male executives who must determine their own philosophies toward their female colleagues and human resource professionals who are charged with watching out for them both.	2002-12-31

This one does, and more. Martin Yate's Knock `Em Dead series has spawned numerous bestsellers. Here's the original, in an all-new, updated edition. The core of the book is a catalogue of strategies for answering the wide array of questions you could be asked during a job interview. The book also includes plenty of other job-hunting advice. If you don't get the job after following this book's advice, it can't be because you flunked the interview. We from getAbstract recommend this book to all job-hunters and to those who think they may be out looking anytime soon.	2002-12-31

Although it's an overused metaphor, top business speakers and best-selling author Brian Tracy show how you can apply battle-proven methods to achieving victory in the world of business. While many of the principles sound familiar, Tracy's presentation is lively and well organized. He covers the importance of having objectives, getting the facts, coordinating your activities, daring to go forward, concentrating your forces, conserving your resources and having one person in charge. He uses battlefield illustrations to remind us of these principles. He also draws on ancient and modern historical accounts of battles to illustrate the close connection between victory in war and in business. If your approach to business hinges on careful strategy and targeted planning, we from getAbstract think you will find tactical weapons in this military manual that you can muster in the fields of commerce.	2002-12-31

Co-authors Rick Frishman and Jill Lublin join Jay Conrad Levinson, author of the 1983 bestseller Guerrilla Marketing, in establishing the war plan for your guerrilla approach to publicity. You supply the planning and persistence; they'll supply the battlefield strategy. The authors take you into the newsrooms and show you how to generate publicity without making reporters dread your calls. You'll learn how to turn rejections into opportunities and how to muster every tool in your arsenal most effectively, from press releases to e-mail. It's a little too list-oriented, but this thorough manual does include plenty of sample materials, including bios, press kit components and printed promotional goodies. We from getAbstract recommend this book to savvy strategists who aren't afraid of wanting - and getting - attention.	2002-12-31

Fishman adapted these first-hand accounts of the early years of the securitization industry from a lecture series at the Kellogg School of Management. The contributions from financial service pioneers are the book's greatest strength. They elucidate the economic and regulatory forces that made securitization a powerful, versatile financial tool. Each chapter stands alone, but the book does not follow a linear narrative. Caveat lector: these lectures were given in 1994, so the sections on current trends and future expectations are out-of-date. Hence, this primer doesn't cover massive changes in financial regulation, an explosion in the types of asset-backed securities (ABSs), the popularity of derivatives or off-balance-sheet accounting to hide fraud. We from getAbstract suggest this book for those entering the financial services industry or for those who need background history. This does not tell you how today's capital markets work, but it is an illuminating eyewitness account of yesterday's.	2002-12-31

Business writer John Kador describes the evolution of Charles Schwab & Company, a former discount brokerage blessed with the ability to transform itself through four different incarnations. Kador emphasizes Schwab's commitment to integrity and customer service, a code that enabled it to prevail despite upheavals and threats. While the book focuses on the company, the running portrait of Chuck Schwab gives it a personal core. Kador highlights Schwab's concern with exercising his values and leading a highly principled business amid an often shady industry he saw as corrupted by greed. Kador's engaging narrative style is designed to inform and entertain general investors, executives and managers. At times, the discussion of Chuck Schwab and his company sounds almost too laudatory, as if the book is an in-house publicity piece. We from getAbstract recommend that readers should take all that sugar with a grain of salt, given this otherwise compelling dish.	2002-12-16

Career management expert Martin Yate and finance whiz Peter Sander have assembled a dandy handbook on making effective presentations. After pointing out the value of developing this key career skill, they focus on how to prepare a good speech. They go from identifying your audience, to determining how best to deliver information, to being ready to be hot stuff at the podium. Similar books have explained these steps before, but the authors couldn't offer their meatier advice without beginning with the basics. Familiar instructions include researching your audience and topic, being yourself and using effective communications techniques. The more distinctive information covers turning your talk into a kind of conversation with the audience, employing audio visual aids effectively and adopting proper stage dress and manners. Though the material is familiar, we from getAbstract appreciate this well-organized, clear presentation and suggests that beginning speakers might want to walk this way before stepping up to the microphone.	2002-12-16

Once upon a time in the halls of academia, being a college graduate was enough. But now, corporations need their employees to have a more intense, ongoing academic and technical education, so they provide it themselves via corporate universities. Mark Allen and other experts from ten corporate universities, academic institutions and consultancies contributed chapters to The Corporate University Handbook, a practical, behind-the-scenes manual about designing and managing a corporate university. The goal goes beyond education: corporate universities must train employees and help corporations excel and prosper. This thorough, yet conversational, examination includes best practices, source notes and programs offered by specific companies including Motorola, Toyota, Sun Microsystems and Charles Schwab, in the U.S. and elsewhere. We from getAbstract assign this insightful book as an authoritative homework seminar for corporate university planners or managers.	2002-12-16

Gary Althen's richly detailed guide shines a psychological, cultural and sociological spotlight on American customs, values, attitudes and behavior. Organized into 22 chapters that cover just about every aspect of American life, the book hits you with its uncanny insight, accuracy and honesty. Although he doesn't completely avoid stereotyping (and doesn't seem at all bothered by it), Althen presents the good, the bad and the quirky. He explains the \\"why\\" behind American attitudes and manners. Even though this is a guide for foreigners visiting, doing business in or living in the United States, we from getAbstract also suggest this book to Americans. It's an eye-opener about the national personality, or the perceived national personality, from naïvete to individualism. As Scotsman Robert Burns wrote, \\"Oh wad some power the giftie gie us, to see oursels as others see us.\\" Well, here's your chance.	2002-12-16

If The New York Times were a high school yearbook, Thomas Friedman would be \\"Most Likely To Succeed.\\" For more than two decades, he has trained his agile, disciplined mind on unraveling the palace intrigue and radical movements of Middle Eastern politics. He tells a story about a waitress in chaotic, war-torn Beirut, who politely asked if he would rather have desert now or wait until the ceasefire took effect. His point: humans can adapt to virtually anything. In this compendium of columns plus a diary of post-911 events, Friedman argues that 9/11 stemmed from U.S. failure to retaliate against prior terrorism. Here, he kicks over the log and shines his light on the origins of the religious intolerance that created 9/11. It's not a pretty sight, but you had better look. To be even modestly informed about today's issues, we from getAbstract maintain, you need to read this.	2002-12-10

Fabozzi, a professor of finance, compiled Investment Management for Insurers, an extensive series of articles (including six they wrote) on managing investments. Various experts contributed the other two-dozen plus articles. The book, which is organized in sections based on major investment management topics, focuses first on general insurance issues, such as risk management and setting up a performance management system for insurers. Subsequent articles cover fixed income products, valuation, equity portfolio management and measuring and controlling interest rate risk. This highly technical book may not be sexy, but it is very sophisticated and fully accessorized with tables, charts, graphs, mathematical formulas and footnotes. Let's be clear: it's a book for pros, an in-depth compilation that we from getAbstract recommend to professional and academic specialists in insurance investment management.	2002-12-10

Management consultant Paul Glen's thorough discussion of geeks brings you brain-to-brain and eye-to-eye with high-tech, specialized knowledge workers. Don't blink: you need these people, so you need to know how to fit your management style to them. Glen describes their primary personality traits and attitudes: commitment to logic, interest in problem solving, independence and, to put it politely, occasionally under-developed social skills. The author, who doesn't seem to mind describing an entire subset of the labor force as if each worker in it had the same personality, explains what geeks need from a manager. You need to nurture motivation, provide internal facilitation, furnish external representation, and manage task, structural, and environmental ambiguity. We from getAbstract suggest this organized, authoritative guide to those who manage knowledge workers. If it's all geek to you, here's the codebook.	2002-12-10

Deeply informed by his marketing experience at Coca-Cola, Sergio Zyman knows advertising theories, but he doesn't like them. He is marketing's angry child, shouting, \\"Traditional advertising just isn't working.\\" He delights in hurling stones at traditional advertising icons, including \\"brand awareness,\\" which may get your product considered, but will not guarantee a sale or an increase in sales. For sales heft, he postulates, position your product to be relevant to the consumer. Build this \\"brand relevance,\\" then start working on media buzz. He compliments his own marketing expertise, but who wants a shy promoter? He says corporations waste ad dollars, so if you work in a traditional glass-house advertising agency, you won't feel too secure when you see angry kid Zyman picking up a rock. His targets, according to we from getAbstract, are people who work in Madison Avenue glass houses, and those who hire them.	2002-11-25

Right or wrong, the customer is always the source of prosperity. Since your business depends on satisfying, keeping and increasing your customers, you'll be glad to know their happiness is in your hands. Stanley A. Brown and Moosha Gulycz describe how to start and run an effective Customer Relationship Management (CRM) program. First, understand your customer and your organization. Then, commit to improving quality, ever striving up hill. Though they stop blessedly short of saying, \\"just hire us,\\" the authors/consultants explain how to use CRM techniques and measurement tools. The principles are familiar, but the detail-rich text uses visuals, questionnaires and case studies for deeper, hard-core teaching. All this nitty-gritty isn't for amateurs, so we from getAbstract know the target customers for this book: managers involved in customer relations; this door is for staff only.	2002-11-25

In Unleashing the Ideavirus, Seth Godin says your idea is contagious, like the flu. But hold on - he's not being insulting. If you think of your idea as a virus, says he, you can \\"infect\\" the marketplace by motivating customers to talk about your product. He stretches this metaphor to explain how to captivate powerful \\"sneezers\\" so they will spread the word. Not a pretty picture, if you are a literal type of person, but you get the concept. For the right product or service, this is an alternative to advertising (or, as Godin calls it, \\"interruption marketing\\"). Though he builds on multi-level marketing concepts, Godin distances himself from their negative image. He writes in a breezy, easy style, with examples, charts and illustrations. If you want to spread the word about this book, we from getAbstract suggest that you just cough politely on someone in marketing, advertising or sales.	2002-11-25

Okay, so you already know that everyone in your organization needs to be learning new skills and tactics all the time. If you wonder just how to accomplish that, on top of everything else you're doing, turn to Michael J. Marquardt's Building the Learning Organization for step by step guidance. Human resource professor Marquardt introduces the internal systems you need for  structured, company-wide learning. In his professorial way, he runs through its dimensions, principles, practices and ideals in detail (all you ever wanted to know and perhaps just a bit more). He provides an instructive general framework, guidelines and sixteen steps to follow in creating a learning organization. He's a man with a plan, system by system, complete with charts, models, principles and subsystems. This tool box for implementation leaves the theoretical reader out of the loop, but we from getAbstract confirm that if you want something you can put into action as an executive, manager or human resource chief, here's your hands-on manual.	2002-11-18

In The Divine Right of Capital, Marjorie Kelly has written a thoughtful, somewhat revolutionary book questioning the basic paradigm of corporate capital: maximizing shareholders' earnings. She compares stockholders who own corporate wealth to feudal European aristocracy as she contends that the current system bestows riches on owners - who add little value to the company - while the employees do all the work. She focuses on this argument despite recent history, during which managers have extracted more value from companies than owners. Her book is a fascinating, clearly written and cogently argued attack, although she repeats some of the central points. Kelly covers the six principles that uphold the economic aristocracy and the six qualities needed to shift to the economic democracy she advocates. While we from getAbstract don't agree with Kelly's philosophy, we suspect that her lively book will intrigue economists, academics and others who like to contemplate the way whole systems function, whether for good or ill.	2002-11-18

Mitnick, a corporate security consultant who was once arrested for computer hacking, has written a fascinating book about how to control security lapses due to the \\"human element.\\" With writer William L. Simon, he describes how con artists use social engineering to gain information by lying to pass themselves off as insiders. By being sensitive to human behavior and taking advantage of trust, they learn to bypass your security systems. The book teaches you how to ward off such threats and educate employees. Yet, problematically, this information could also help con artists be more sophisticated. In any case, this highly informative, engaging book includes sample conversations that open the door to information, along with tips about how various cons are used and what to do about them. We from getAbstract recommend this book to corporate officers, information managers, human resource directors and security personnel, but don't tell anybody.	2002-11-18

In Blindsided, change expert Jim Harris discusses the startling way some major companies got \\"blindsided\\" - caught with their antenna down by fast-moving technological changes that undermined their businesses. He fills you in on how change works, and works quickly. Then, as if to make you feel better, he offers practical techniques that superior companies use to avoid being walloped. Harris tells you (consider this a warning) what to do to deal with change. Generally, this is a top-notch, straightforward  book, although some corporate histories and guideposts on recognizing change may sound like retreads of other material. Still, Harris provides a guidebook for heeding and handling change. Just ask yourself the questions at the end of each chapter to find out if you need this heads up strategy check. We from getAbstract suggest that diagnostic dialog to  business strategists and executives. Just keep looking behind you while you are reading - someone, or something, may be gaining on you.	2002-11-18

If you still think you have to hammer yourself to get ahead, stop doing two things at once and listen to Robert J. Kriegel. The author, an expert in human performance and the psychology of change, says most people work too strenuously at a frantic pace that generates stress and reduces performance. You can perform better if you work smarter, even at 80% or 90% of your current buzz. If you've read human potential success books, some of this will sound familiar, but Kriegel focuses on becoming successful while having a full personal life. He quotes managers and employees, and outlines exactly what you should do. You're on your own figuring out what a 90% effort amounts to, but if you're a mid-level manager or executive who likes Kriegel's idea of winning-by-easing-up, we recommend that you somehow find the time to read his book.	2002-11-11

Christopher Culp definitively combines a thorough reference work on company-wide risk management with a sweeping discussion of the best hedging practices. Since this is also a textbook, you'll find the kind of math that would make even Einstein sweat. But, as the author notes, he's written this book for senior managers, so you have a note from the teacher that you can skip the math and statistics if you have a staff for that. Instead, apply your executive thinking skills to absorbing Culp's excellent lessons in risk management theory and practice. We from getAbstract recommend this book to senior managers and directors - in other words, any executives who create, implement or supervise risk management strategies.	2002-11-11

In Insurance from Underwriting to Derivaties, Eric Briys and Francois de Varenne, both Deutsche Bank insurance experts, have written a highly technical, albeit readable, book for their professional peers. They discuss property-casualty insurance, risk, securitizing, pricing and liabilities duration in the United States and Europe. However, it will dawn on the casual reader fairly early that there should be an \\"experts only\\" label on the book jacket. Even the basic introduction to property-casualty insurance begins with the presentation of complex mathematical models. More daunting models, charts and graphs elucidate information throughout. Insiders will appreciate this data and the extensive footnotes and references. While this may not be a book for the mid-management reader, we from getAbstract assure you, without risk, that its target audience - financial executives and professionals in the insurance industry - will be very glad to have it.	2002-11-11

He sets out the risk control and capital structure functions of various classical and alternative risk transfer steps, such as derivatives targeted at market and credit risk, asset divestiture, insurance and reinsurance. Don't even go here if you aren't already familiar with (or studying) the sophisticated basics of finance, since this is highly technical reading, including numerous formulas, charts and graphs describing financial theories and processes. But if you are an expert, we from getAbstract congratulate you on finding your way to Culp, who aimed his book at the already-savvy: corporate treasurers, financial officers and those who participate in capital markets and the reinsurance industry.	2002-11-11

Although the day-trading fad largely disappeared along with the paper profits of the 1990s high-tech bubble, a committed cadre of extreme investors continue to test their mettle against an unforgiving market. Day traders use computer links to stock markets to trade fast and frequently in the hope of profiting from small moves in stock prices. They are lured by the promise of riches, but many are unsuited for the risky venture and ultimately lose everything. Gregory Millman traces the history of day trading, with an emphasis on the unique pitfalls posed by this endeavor. Millman deciphers trading jargon and includes a section outlining the most common techniques utilized by day traders. We from getAbstract recommend this book for its insightful glimpse into a little understood phenomenon.	2002-11-05

Giuliani (with writer Ken Kurson) gives you the inside look at how he applied basic leadership principles to being Mayor, Associate Attorney General and U.S. Attorney. Giuliani reveals how he and his key team applied these principles in the face of the Sept. 11 World Trade Tower collapse, and focuses on exercising leadership all the time. The principles may sound familiar - prioritize, prepare, take responsibility, hold everyone accountable, recruit great people, reflect and then decide, under-promise and over-deliver, develop and employ strong beliefs, be loyal and purposeful - yet the thrill comes from learning how Giuliani straightforwardly applied these principles to accomplish Herculean tasks. We from getAbstract recommend this breezy, engaging book to business leaders, governmental managers and politics junkies.	2002-11-05

Reading Zig Ziglar on sales is little like looking over Beethoven's shoulder at the piano. For decades, Ziglar has championed the role of the noble sales professional. Here, he tells how he made - and botched - his first sales call back in 1947. Despite the passing years since that first sales call, Ziglar's message of integrity and sales acumen remains relevant and fresh. As the master says, sales is the transference of belief. We from getAbstract invite everyone to read this book on sales, and become a believer.	2002-11-05

If your view of Alan Greenspan is one of a humorless, pin-striped central banker, Jerome Tuccille has someone he'd like to introduce you to: Alan Greenspan, the jazz musician, libertarian philosopher and wooer of media princesses. In this lively and engaging book, Tuccille weaves together Greenspan's biography, a colorful history of the times and an analysis of political and economic philosophy. Of special note is the book's detailed look at how the thinking of Ayn Rand influenced Greenspan. We from getAbstract strongly recommend this book for such intellectual fare, as well as its juicer tidbits - like Greenspan's torrid fling with Barbara Walters.	2002-11-05

That creaking sound you hear is Bill Dimma closing the barn door after Enron already got out. Dimma sounds a late, but nevertheless critical, wakeup call for U.S. corporations: They must institute policies of sound corporate governance at the board of directors level if they are to succeed and survive. About 80% of Fortune 500 companies combine the roles of chairman of the board and CEO, violating Dimma's rule number one - separate powers. We from getAbstract recommend that the management and directors of every one of these companies read Dimma's book and implement the measures that he prescribes.	2002-11-05

The image of wheelchair-bound Stephen Hawking expounding on the exotic realities of a vast universe has become so indelibly etched into popular culture that it's easy to forget that Hawking achieved a spot in the ranks of history's great thinkers long before he become a scientific icon. It isn't every day that you get to read a book whose author helped to shape his field in a fundamental way. Even though he is considered the most brilliant theoretical physicist since Einstein, Hawking has managed to produce an accessible and enjoyable book that can be understood by laymen as well as scientists. We from getAbstract recommend this book not only for its masterly explanation of the workings of the universe, but also for its studied examination of what new discoveries mean for common man, philosophy and religion.	2002-10-22

Pulitzer Prize-nominated Wall Street Journal journalist Mitchell Pacelle has written an absorbing tale that rivals any novel of business melodrama. If there's anyone left out there who thinks that real estate deals are dry, number-crunching exercises in dullness, this behind-the-scenes look at the extreme personalities vying for control of the Empire State Building will set that myth aside once and for all. We from getAbstract recommend this expertly written page-turner to all readers.	2002-10-22

In another era, we might have been tempted to shrug off How Companies Lie as just another polemic against corporate greed. In the wake of Enron, Global Crossing, Tyco and a host of other corporate scandals, however, we must (sorrowfully) admit that this book is as timely as it is insightful. Readers will gain much from the book's explanation of some of the actual accounting techniques that companies use to mislead investors, as well as its advice on how to spot telltale signs that a company might be cooking the books. While financial and accounting experts might find this analysis a bit basic, we from getAbstract recommend this book to all general business readers.	2002-10-22

Like most small companies, getAbstract relies on our sales force to stay in business, and our sales force relies on Stephan Schiffman. His sales advice is simple, applicable and, above all else, effective. His work is full of tips that help you get better results. If you think that you don't need another book on sales, getAbstract would reply with a classic Schiffman: \\"You know, a lot of other people told me the same thing before they had the chance to see how this book could help them increase sales.\\"	2002-10-22

Michael Campbell notes a shocking statistic in the opening pages of his book: Americans fear public speaking more than death. One reason that so many professionals dread making presentations is that they have not been trained in the basics. The best public speakers use techniques that can be taught and learned, and Campbell presents many of the most important of these methods here. We from getAbstract strongly recommend this book to any novice public speakers, as well as to presentation veterans who are sure to pick up a new trick or two.	2002-10-22

Only the Paranoid Survive will never be compared with Churchill's memoirs in terms of literary mastery, but Andrew Grove's book does succeed where many other business tell-alls fail: It illustrates the lessons that you can learn from the challenges that its protagonist has overcome. In other words, this book teaches you something. By focusing on the make-or-break turning points that determined Intel's fate, Grove shows how to manage crises in order to seize the opportunities that they so often provide. For this simple lesson, we from getAbstract recommend this book to all business readers.	2002-10-11

One common thread has connected the companies involved in the recent spate of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and scandals: The failure of boards of directors to control management. John Carver, an international consultant on corporate governance, explains the role of the board of directors and defines the proper relationship between the board and top management. To summarize: The board commands; management obeys. Since this is all too often not the case, we from getAbstract strongly recommend that everyone in business read this book for its essential advice on strengthening the authority and accountability of corporate boards of directors.	2002-10-11

Anyone who's ever tried his or her hand at project management knows that there is no single secret that guarantees success. In reality, effective project management is the result of nuts-and-bolts work in planning, organization and oversight. Smart readers will therefore bypass the scores of books promising the \\"10 Secrets to Project Management Success\\" and turn instead to Harvey A. Levine's comprehensive and slightly complex book. Without wasting words, we from getAbstract simply advise everyone in business to rely on Practical Project Management as the best guide to project management available today.	2002-10-11

Jack Trout and Steve Rivkin re-introduce the concepts of simplicity and common sense to a business world steeped in information, high-tech consulting and strategic theories. By getting back to the basics and avoiding the latest hot consulting advice, companies can differentiate themselves in the minds of customers and win increasing returns. We from getAbstract recommend this book to all readers with an interest in business strategy and to anyone who feels mired in a swamp of information and complexity.	2002-10-11

Henning's diagnosis of the growing irrelevancy of business staff groups is right on the money. Simply put, staff members have for too long cozied up to management, ignoring the critical line units that they are supposed to serve. As a result, it's the staff gets laid off first when times get tough. Likewise, Henning's prescriptions for revamping staff groups into effective support units merit careful study. Although sections of this book are thin in substance, we from getAbstract recommend this insightful analysis of corporate structure to all business leaders.	2002-10-11

Thanks to endorsements from managerial heavyweights like Jack Welch, most people in business are by now familiar with Six Sigma as a process for measuring and reducing product defects. In Strategic Six Sigma, however, Dick Smith, Jerry Blakeslee and Richard Koonce demonstrate that the Six Sigma methodology can and should be applied to the highest levels of strategic planning. Simply put, the authors illustrate how the rigors of Six Sigma can improve your performance in terms of overall strategy, growth and customer satisfaction in the same way that it streamlines operations on a production floor. We...strongly recommend this book to business leaders, executives and managers, all of whom will benefit from its hands-on advice for integrating the tenets of Six Sigma into corporate strategy.	2002-10-11

Critchley has written a What Color Is Your Parachute? for the over-50 crowd. The book is timely in that changes in the workplace, medicine and technology have made it possible - and in some cases economically mandatory - for older people to remain in the workforce as full-time and part-time employees, temps and consultants. For many people in this age bracket, however, it's been many years since they last plunged into a job search. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book, which tends to the basic, for all readers in this newly emerging group.	2002-10-11

Charisma and reputation have replaced management experience and industry expertise in the corner office. Certainly that's not news to anyone who has read the business press at any time in the past decade, but the trend is certainly important enough to warrant the comprehensive examination provided by Rakesh Kurana. Starting with an analysis of the increasing power of activist institutional investors, Kurana traces the process through which boards of directors have forsaken mature managers for media darlings in their CEO searches. In light of the spate of embarrassing and enraging CEO scandals, we from getAbstract recommend this book to all readers.	2002-10-11

Sure, some of the book's more startling factual assertions are, on closer examination, somewhat distorted. But this is a call to arms, not a scholarly dissection. By depicting our consumer culture as a deadly epidemic, the authors provide a metaphor that simply and intuitively captures the fears and concerns of millions of people worldwide. While some conservative readers might scoff at a book that breathlessly states that life was better before the industrial revolution, we from getAbstract recommend this book as a valuable peek into the intellectual world of the anti-globalization left.	2002-10-11

Newscasts are filled with reports of democracy's relentless spread across the planet, but less is heard of its expansion through the corporate world. Just as dictators and oligarchs everywhere are being toppled from power, the hierarchical management structures that have governed organizations since before the industrial revolution are falling. Their usurper is self-management - the concept that motivated employees empowered to make their own decisions will work harder, faster and smarter than their rigidly controlled counterparts. Kenneth Cloke and Joan Goldsmith document this organizational coup and instruct executives on how to incite the revolution in their own companies. While acknowledging the scarcity of hard data to prove some of the book's assertions, we from getAbstract highly recommend The End of Management to all executives for its innovative take on modern organizational theory.	2002-09-30

At first glance, Tech-Venture seems like a nostalgic flashback to early 2000. A quick skim through its pages reveals statements like: \\"Old economy valuation methods, such as discounted cash flows and comparable company multiples, are ineffective for New Economy companies.\\" But don't be fooled, this book is more than just an obsolete relic of the bubble. Once you get past the sections devoted to high-tech start-ups, you'll find a thoughtful examination of technology's role in such critical 21st-century business mainstays as customer relationship management and supply-chain management. For this intelligent analysis, along with equally interesting chapters identifying technologies likely to spawn future revolutions, we from getAbstract recommend this book to managers in business development and technology.	2002-09-27

Lucid, organized, utterly practical and results-oriented, this cookbook for team builders and members belongs on every organization's bookshelf. Barner has condensed everything he has learned from two decades of consulting and team-building experience into a five-step process for improving team relationships and performance. He identifies the most common pitfalls for teams, and provides a kit of 51 tools designed for specific team-building or team-repair tasks. Neither abstract nor psychological in nature, this practical workbook describes proven techniques and strategies for quickly and effectively addressing a wide range of problems that frequently occur among teams. Bottom line: we from getAbstract consider this an essential resource for managers, team leaders and team members.	2002-09-27

Arthur Dobrin takes a novel approach to the study of ethics: Instead of crafting complex ethical systems, he encourages his readers to figure out their own standards. He does this by sketching the broad outlines of Judeo-Christian moral tradition and the ethical thinking of the world's great philosophers. After laying this basic groundwork, he proceeds to present readers with a series of scenarios in which they are asked to decide what they would do. Dobrin hopes that readers will discover patterns in their responses that will reveal their own ethical systems. We from getAbstract highly recommend this enlightening book.	2002-09-27

Jonathon Lazear equates compulsive work with alcoholism - a dependency that amounts to a disease. Carrying on that analogy, Lazear presents a list of workaholism's symptoms, and a 10-step program to overcome the obsession with work. Although passages condemning overachievers and perfectionists will sound like fingernails on a chalkboard to many business men and women, we from getAbstract recommend this book to all executives, who would do well to heed this much of Lazear's advice: Make sure that you are not letting your job crowd out the important things in life.	2002-09-25

Harvard don and civil-liberties lawyer extraordinaire Alan Dershowitz turns his keen and combative eye to the war on terrorism, and the results aren't pretty. His conclusions about the causes of terrorism and the most effective means of fighting will not sit well with many of Dershowitz's historically steadfast supporters. The normally liberal lawyer lambastes European governments for what he characterizes as their cowardly appeasement of terrorists, which he points to as the central driver of growth in the terrorism industry. He also proclaims flatly that the international community should purposefully refrain from addressing the \\"root causes\\" of any group that adopts terrorist means. How this would work in practice is never quite explained, but nevertheless, we from getAbstract recommend this important and damning book as a welcomed addition to the emerging debate on how best to wage the war on terrorism.	2002-09-25

If you've ever thought that your boss is a Neanderthal (or you've been accused of being one), take heart - it's perfectly natural. Nigel Nicholson reminds us that we are, after all, only animals working with the same Stone Age minds we've had for millions of years. Once you accept this premise, you're ready to incorporate evolutionary psychology into your management techniques and get human nature to work for you, rather than against you. Despite the fact that some sections fail to dig beneath the superficial, we from getAbstract recommend this book to anyone in search of a fresh perspective on management.	2002-09-17

Neuro linguistic programming, which sounds like a diabolical technique straight out of A Clockwork Orange, is actually a relatively straightforward method of paying attention to the verbal and non-verbal messages that people constantly emit. By noting the inflection, body language and eye movements of others, you can glean a better understanding of what they are really thinking. Conversely, by controlling the signals that you send, you can make sure that people are getting the right message. With the caveat that many elements of NLP are straight out of Communications 101, we from getAbstract recommend this book to anyone in business whose communications skills could use an upgrade.	2002-09-17

Fox has a talent for pointing out the obvious, but often forgotten, basics of business and management. Like Fox's previous books, How to Become a Great Boss contains almost nothing that is entirely original. Instead, it compiles what should be common-sense guidelines for effective leadership and presents them in a manner that is both educational and inspirational. Fox has the ability to get you thinking about what you are doing as a manager and about the things that you have allowed to fall by the wayside. For that simple but valuable lesson, we from getAbstract strongly recommend this book to all bosses, managers and leaders.	2002-09-17

In Power Up Your Mind, Bill Lucas attempts to teach readers how to learn. To accomplish this goal, he sets out to provide a blueprint to the workings of the human brain through easy-to-grasp descriptions and illustrations designed to explain how the brain ingests and processes information. What's lacking is a comprehensive review of the basic theories of learning that experts have deduced from the biological structures and mental functions that Lukas describes. Nevertheless, we from getAbstract recommend this book for its theoretical insights and practical advice about learning and memory.	2002-09-17

As any self-employed lawyer, consultant or accountant knows, selling services can be much tougher than selling widgets. The major professional service firms employ huge marketing staffs whose job is to convince potential clients that they need the company's expertise, and to differentiate that expertise from all other competitors. Three marketing professors - Philip Kotler, Thomas Hayes and Paul N. Bloom - have distilled the strategies and techniques designed to accomplish this daunting task into this comprehensive text, which we from getAbstract recommend to anyone running their own services firm and to all those charged with marketing the majors.	2002-09-17

Jim Rohwer does a wonderful job explaining the complexities of the 1997-98 Asian economic crises and what the future holds for the region in this era of globalization. Using a unique style, he tells the stories of Asian nations - how the `90s crises affected their economies and populations, what they've done in response and how they are positioned for the future. This is done with a striking lack of hard numbers, which might diminish the credibility of some observations, but certainly helps them go down a little easier. We from getAbstract recommend this book to all readers with an intellectual or business interest in Asia.	2002-09-13

If journalism is the first rough draft of history, Friedman's version may require only a light edit from future generations. Concisely cutting through the relentless pattern of attack and counter-attack that has characterized the Middle East for more than 50 years, Friedman finds a balance between seemingly bloodthirsty enemies. He delves into the cultural development of the peoples of the region from tribal origins, analyzing how their early struggles for survival color current events. We from getAbstract recommend this book as essential reading for any thoughtful person who wants to better understand the historical obstacles to peace in the Middle East.	2002-09-13

Inside Yahoo! presents a blow-by-blow chronology of the birth, ascension and downfall of a company that - in terms of business model and stock price - was the archetype of the `90s dot-com. Readers will be hard pressed to identify any relevant fact or event from the life of Yahoo! overlooked by author Karen Angel. What is missed however, is meaty analysis: Did the hubris of Yahoo!'s founders contribute to the company's reversal of fortunes? Angel doesn't speculate. Nevertheless, we from getAbstract recommend her book for its comprehensive recounting of a business tale that truly captures the essence of the Internet boom.	2002-09-13

Mark Douglas compares a great trader to a world-class athlete: Both have honed skills, reflexes, instinct and will to a fine edge. Both have reached a condition where a winning performance is an automatic, utterly unconscious, process - They are operating in the zone. To reach the zone, traders must impose mental self-discipline. By adhering to a consistent and strict trading system, maintained by a consistent and strict mentality, Douglas contends that people can learn how to make money trading. We from getAbstract recommend this book for its underlying message that great traders are made, not born.	2002-09-13

Performance Drivers provides a comprehensive explanation of the balanced scorecard system, which is designed to help companies measure and improve their performance. More importantly perhaps, the book also includes an honest assessment of the balanced scorecard's shortcomings and weaknesses, along with suggestions on how you can improve the effectiveness of your own system and increase its chances of success. The writing tends to the dry, which might be a result of the translation from its original Swedish. Nevertheless, we from getAbstract strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning the intricacies of the balanced scorecard.	2002-09-13

John O'Keeffe's book is worth a read for the simple but powerful message that it conveys: Too many people in business today are devoted to incremental improvement when they should be striving for big goals and breakthrough performance. Also of note are the techniques that he describes for cultivating creative thinking within a business. While much of the remainder will seem like a re-hash of basic problem-solving and common-sense creative thinking methodology, we from getAbstract nevertheless recommend this book for its motivational message: Think big.	2002-09-10

The small business market, the coveted target of many salespeople, is a myth. At least 85% of small businesses are not real sales prospects; they are one-man shops, paper companies and fly-by-night shows. John Warrillow provides an invaluable service to salespeople around the world by explaining how to spot and eliminate this \\"sludge.\\" He also tells how to segment viable companies to identify the best potential prospects. We from getAbstract strongly recommend that all salespeople read this priceless book.	2002-09-10

Bad news for corporate executives: Any IT investments you made before 1995 are now obsolete.<br />That's the message from Richard Nolan, who advises companies to forget about updating their legacy systems and begin anew from scratch. Why is such a dramatic gesture required? Because technology advances over the past decade have totally revamped the competitive landscape, making speed and flexibility the business imperatives of the 21st century. Sure, there are echoes of `90s Net hysteria here, but we from getAbstract strongly recommend this book as a warning that, just because the bubble has burst, decision makers cannot afford to neglect their IT systems.	2002-09-10

Culture.com is at its best when it describes the effect that the Internet revolution is having on the corporate cultures of modern business. Of special merit are the book's lists of suggestions that managers and human resource executives can follow in attempting to develop a new culture that adequately addresses the changes and strains brought on by the rise of the virtual revolution. Also intriguing is the book's analysis of the dangerous transition period in which companies shift from old cultures to dot-com cultures. While the book is less effective in its look at the more general trends of technology, business and leadership, we from getAbstract nevertheless recommend it for its innovative take on virtual corporate culture.	2002-09-10

We immediately liked John Whitmore's book on coaching for one simple reason: It admits right off that a coterie of charlatans have passed off their bogus \\"consulting\\" approaches as business coaching, thereby diminishing the credibility of the practice. But Whitmore does more than recognize the problem: He sets the record straight by providing a true definition, a working history and a psychological explanation of real coaching, which evolved out of sports performance enhancement. Capping off this overview is a comprehensive guide to practical coaching practices, complete with techniques that readers can adopt in their own careers. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book to all business managers, human resource professionals and, of course, coaches.	2002-09-10

Michael Hammer is the man responsible for the early 1990s reengineering craze, but we'll forgive him for that after reading the mea culpa that he includes at the start of his newest book. While it's unlikely that the remedies Hammer prescribes in The Agenda will be misused as a business cure-all in the same way that reengineering was co-opted, the methods, techniques and philosophies that he presents this time around are actually more practical and on target. In a nutshell, Hammer tells us that the customer is now in control and spends his entire book explaining how to re-build your company around meeting your customers' needs. For that simple lesson, we from getAbstract highly recommend this book to all readers.	2002-09-10

Implementing new software into your company's core businesses processes is a painful procedure. Technically challenged readers might well find some pain in the pages of this book, but the agony is no fault of the author. The topic at hand, integrating new software applications packages with current systems, is one of the most complex and difficult challenges in all of business. We from getAbstract recommend that you take your medicine like a man (or a woman) and read this comprehensive guide to meshing new software with your old business.

Before venturing off into more mystical writings, Deepak Chopra built his publishing career with a number of best-selling health books, including this one. Chopra writes beautifully - and understandably - about the complex workings of your body, and how your lifestyle and health-related choices affect the aging process. Whether or not you buy into Chopra's contention that lifestyle changes can stop or reverse this process, we from getAbstract recommend that you read this book for its enlightened advice about how to live a healthier - and longer - life.	2002-09-10

All too often, the customer gets lost within the intricacies of customer relationship management. Don Peppers and Martha Rogers bring the customer back into the equation in this fieldbook designed to help companies implement their one-to-one marketing strategies. The book addresses the very questions that bring companies to CRM in the first place: How do I know who my best customers are? How can I customize my service for my best customers? How do I get my customers to stay loyal? For its clearheaded answers to these difficult questions, we from getAbstract recommend this book to all readers	2002-09-10

There's no reason to beat around the bush: This is not an objective history of Cisco. It is an unabashedly adulatory look at one of the most influential companies of the New Economy. If you're looking for a critical assessment of Cisco's business model and execution, look elsewhere. That does not mean that you should ignore Inside Cisco, however. On the contrary, we from getAbstract strongly recommend this book for its detailed dissection of Cisco's acquisition methodology, from its target identification and selection to integration and employee retention. Anyone in business would do well to read this book, study these processes and make them their own.	2002-09-10

Aimed at those with little or no business or investment knowledge, this book explains how to earn money in addition to your salary and how to plug leaks in your cash flow. Robert G.

In the last 24 hours have you: 1) Drank a cup of Starbucks coffee? 2) Worn a pair of hiking boots that cost more than $100, or 3) Eaten any organically grown food? If so, chances are that you're a Bobo. The Bobos, or Bourgeois Bohemians, are the moneyed and cultured elites who comprise today's establishment. As they assume a dominant role in the business world, the Bobos are bringing with them the artistic flair, cultural irreverence and social awareness that they - or their parents - experienced in the 1960s. Author David Brooks is to be commended for identifying this group, and tagging it with an appropriately deprecating nickname. We from getAbstract highly recommend this engaging, insightful - and let's face it- kind of embarrassing analysis of today's upper class.	2002-07-29

After 25 books on selling, you might think that Brian Tracy's well would be running dry. Luckily that's not entirely the case, although this latest effort lacks some of the crispness and innovation that characterized Tracy's earlier work. Be a Sales Superstar is at its best when dealing with the daily grind of selling: presenting your product, overcoming objections and closing the deal. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book for its creative and effective techniques in each of these critical areas.	2002-07-29

Balancing the needs of a business and the family that controls it might seem like an overwhelming task, unless you tackle the challenge with a clear-headed plan. Randel S. Carlock and John L. Ward provide just such an approach by mapping out the strategies and structures needed to make a family business run smoothly. In so doing, they address family conflict, executive succession, ownership schemes and a host of other issues that can make or break a family business. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book too for its practical and applicable methods of striking a balance between the needs of business and the needs of family.	2002-07-23

Peter Morgan Mash seems to be one of those people upon whom good fortune shines. Just when he's about to lose a big deal, chance rears its beautiful head to help him on his way; just when he's about to give up on meeting a key potential investor, he ends up stuck in the elevator with him. To what does Mash attribute his good fortune? Simple kindness, integrity and personal values. By stressing these personal attributes, he says that anyone can benefit from the kindness of life. We from getAbstract recommend this book to anyone convinced that the universe is a basically friendly place.	2002-07-23

Women everywhere are talking about Creating A Life, which exploded into the U.S. media with a controversial and disturbing message: Career women are waiting too long to have children! Despite the uproar it has caused, Sylvia Ann Hewlett's analysis of the situation is actually quite evenhanded, even if she is prone to overgeneralization. Hewlett does not attack childless women - as many have accused - rather, she logically assesses the reasons that so many highly successful women do not have kids. Her prescriptions for the problem of high-achiever childlessness might not win her any friends in feminist camps, but nevertheless, we from getAbstract highly recommend that all professional women (and their husbands or potential husbands) read this book and decide for themselves.	2002-07-23

In exhaustive detail William J. Rothwell shows you the hows and whys of succession planning and management in this second edition of his landmark book. Given the general corporate predilection for systems and bureaucracies, top executives and managers of both large and small businesses will revel in the way Rothwell lays out his well-researched plan. His ample how-to lists and charts can be adapted to fit almost any industry. Despite the author's scholarly credentials and depth of information, his writing is not academic. We from getAbstract recommend this book to executives and managers, particularly if your company doesn't already have a succession plan.	2002-07-15

Lank take a long hard look at the family business, both as a powerful engine of economic development and as a fragile organism in need of constant care and attention. After an initial examination of family business' role in the global economy, Neubauer and Lank turn to an assessment of what makes some family concerns thrive while others disintegrate. Their answer: corporate governance, or the lack thereof. An academic tone permeates the book, resulting in both some patches of dry prose and an intellectual rigor lacking in most business books. We from getAbstract highly recommend this serious study of family business to any serious students of business in general.	2002-07-15

Have you ever had to decide whether to pick up that juicy Tom Clancy book or that stale, but important business one? Steven Fink splits the difference and solves your problem with this book that is half spy story, half business advice. Sticky Fingers works best as a thriller. As business advice, the book highlights the basic issues for U.S. companies fighting economic espionage, but falls short of serving up a complete playbook. The devil, as always, is in the details, and the specifics of the books real-life cases sketch a more accurate picture of this particular devil than the generalized advice. If economic espionage is the elephant in the corner that your company has been pretending does not exist, we from getAbstract recommend Sticky Fingers as a starting point to finally taking action to protect yourself.	2002-07-15

Succeeding Generations takes the family business where few dare to venture: into the perilous landscape of succession - the boneyard of many a family enterprise felled by dissension, sibling rivalry, and greed. Ivan Lansberg, co-founder of the Family Firm Institute and your guide through this treacherous terrain, neatly straddles the worlds of academic rigor and real-world experience as he shows you how to pave the way for the generation to come. Case studies of well-known family businesses illustrate Lansberg's observations and bring his advice home. We from getAbstract recommend this book to anyone involved in the complex concern of family business.	2002-07-15

Richard Koch follows up his best-selling The 80/20 Principle with this engrossing look at science's universal principles (biological, physical and non-linear) at work in the business world. Richly detailed and splendidly written, this page-turner will change the way you look at every aspect of business. Koch shows you how innovation and success happen when you work with Mother Nature, and not against her. Don't worry if you slept through high school and college science classes, the author guides you smoothly through scientific theories as he applies them to business. We from getAbstract highly recommend this soon-to-be-classic to everyone in the business world, even if you are a former physics flunkie.	2002-07-15

Brian Tracy seems to have the answer for everything, including how to get that raise and promotion. Actually, his point is that you have the answer to everything, if only you can achieve clarity - knowing exactly what you want and how to get there - while disciplining yourself to work toward your objective. Can it really be that easy? Well one thing's for sure, reading this book will make it a lot easier. This volume offers 21 short chapters of clearly presented, easy to absorb (if not always strictly grammatical) material. We from getAbstract recommend it to anyone in any field who aspires to be promoted. After all, would you turn down more money? We didn't think so.	2002-07-09

Janet Abbate exhaustively researched her scholarly history of the Internet and presents it with the detail and tone you would expect from a historian, which she is. Therefore, don't come looking for a breezy, \\"gee whiz\\" approach. This is not a promotional pat on the back to the companies that helped popularize the Internet, nor does it glorify dot-coms or any of their fearless leaders. In fact, Abbate devotes the first 75% of her book to the precursor to the public Internet - the ARPANET system used by scientists, researchers and the U.S. military. We recommend this book to all readers who want to know how the Internet really came into existence and how it evolved from a private, secret, scientific resource into today's vast realm of public information, auctions, virtual bookstores, e-mail and even getAbstract.	2002-07-09

In the wake of the Enron bankruptcy, there has been plenty of teeth-gnashing about what went wrong, but far too little analysis of what we can do to make things better. Samuel A. DiPiazza, Jr., CEO of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Robert G. Eccles, a PwC fellow and former Harvard Business School Professor, take a brave stab at addressing the fundamental shortfalls in the process through which companies report their performance. By proposing a new vision of corporate transparency, the authors take an important first step in reforming the corporate reporting system and restoring investor confidence. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book to any readers wondering where the financial community should go from here.	2002-07-08

Alan Weiss is blessed with the ability to pay attention to details without losing sight of the big picture. He gets down and dirty when he has to, telling would-be independent consultants to take an honest look at your balance sheet and to shave every spare penny off your monthly bills. Yet he also flies high with some broad (and occasionally obvious) advice - such as promoting yourself so that business comes looking for you, rather than the other way around. We from getAbstract particularly appreciate the inspired editorial design, which features important principles, definitions and Q&amp;As with successful consultants.	2002-07-08

A new edition of his public relations primer. When? Now. Why? Because small business needs an Internet-friendly PR update. How? Pretty good, thank you. Putting those five questions at the heart of your press release is only one of the techniques this book describes for creating an effective publicity campaign. Parkhurst focuses on obtaining low-cost publicity, including how to do your own press releases and Web-page designs. Much of the book deals with well-established strategies, including those described in an earlier edition. This edition's new material covers E-publicity and use of the Internet.

Francis Fukuyama, who notably proclaimed the end of history in his last great work, now declares that humanity's biological clock is ticking, and time is running out for our leaders to make decisions that will guide the development of biotechnology. Blending the disparate realms of science, philosophy, economics, politics and religion in an ecumenical, well-balanced book, Fukuyama analyzes the implications of advances in biology, genetics, and a slew of new sciences that you've probably never even heard of. In so doing, he never skirts issues of right and wrong, concepts generally relegated to the sidelines in scientific texts. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book to all readers, and suggests that it be made mandatory reading for scientists and politicians alike.	2002-06-17

Despite recent troubles that might cause readers to quibble with Florence M. Stone's description of Oracle as a \\"phenomenal success,\\" this examination of Larry Ellison and the company that he created is worth your time. Stone sticks to a single theme: How do Ellison's personal beliefs, characteristics and personality affect the way Oracle does business? In answering this question, the book delves into the brutish outlook of company and founder, which Stone summarizes as, \\"crush the competition.\\" Oddly, Ellison himself is not present. Instead, we glimpse him only through the words of official spokesmen and journalists. Luckily, these accounts were written after the dot-com collapse, providing the book with a balanced, up-to-date perspective. We from getAbstract recommend this book to all readers, whether your interests are in high tech or general business strategy.	2002-06-17

Paul Zane Pilzer is an economist with a vision. Pilzer sees technological advances remaking the way Americans think about health. In his eyes, scientific breakthroughs are ushering in a revolution that will transform our current healthcare system - which Pilzer describes as the sickness industry - into the proactive, lifestyle-based wellness industry. His book describes this revolution in two parts. The first half, which will appeal to a wide range of readers, analyzes the current state of healthcare and advances in biology and cellular biochemistry. In the second half of the book, which takes a more dollar-minded approach, Pilzer attempts to identify business and investment opportunities that will arise from the Wellness Revolution. Thus, we from getAbstract heartily recommend this book to both camps: the general-interest reader, and the entrepreneur or investor on the hunt for new opportunities.	2002-06-17

In The Human Value of Enterprise, Andrew Mayo proposes a quantitative methodology that attempts to bring the rigors of financial accounting to human resources management. Mayo sets forth a series of formulas designed to reveal how much each individual is contributing to the overall value that any company creates for its stakeholders. Of course, these formulas are limited by the subjective process through which managers assign values to the activities and results of their employees. That said, the procedures that Mayo outlines can be used as the foundation for a fairly rigorous system of human resource cost accounting that we from getAbstract recommend to all professionals in the field.	2002-06-17

Never has a business trend been more popular, more expensive and less understood than customer relationship management, or CRM. The costs of CRM can be astronomical, and while the benefits also can be great, they are often less easily to predict, due to the complexity of the systems. Byron Bergeron breaks down CRM into its component parts, and in so doing, helps the reader grasp just what makes the price so high, and why it might all be worthwhile. In his discussion, Bergeron touches on the major suppliers of CRM technology, the need for employee training, implementation issues, and virtually every other factor an executive might need to consider in evaluating whether or not to undertake a CRM program.

In Balanced Scorecard Step-by-Step, Paul R. Niven expands upon the balanced scorecard methodology he originally developed with Dave Norton 10 years earlier. Balanced Scorecard is designed to focus an entire organization on implementing and improving its strategy. In this book, Niven puts the Balanced Scorecard approach into practice, focusing on the details of implementation and the role of leadership in establishing and maintaining the program. We from getAbstract recommend this book for any executive looking for nuts-and-bolts knowledge about a performance measurement system that grew into a comprehensive management philosophy.	2002-06-04

If you can make it past the typical James Cramer stock-market cheerleading, The Street.com's guide to investing is well worth a look for novices. Skip over the dated, New Economy hype and get right to the overview of global equity markets, including risk factors, economic indicators and corporate performance measures. Author Dave Kansas does a great job of summarizing these voluminous concepts in a way that's easy to digest and remember. This book reads much better than most of those in the investment field, perhaps because it was written by actual writers, not economic experts fumbling their way through the writing process, or ghostwriters churning out personality-free prose. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book to beginning investors, with a word of warning: The tone of this book is still very much of the optimistic `90s era, and does not seem to reflect the subsequent market retreat.	2002-06-04

If you like your corporate biographies short on technological details and long on struggles for survival and success, Piloting Palm is the book for you. Andrea Butter, Palm's marketing director in the early days, provides backstage access to Palm's evolutionary drama, complete with political infighting, searches for cash and the simple quest for survival. The story is told largely from the point of view of Jeff Hawkins, whom Butter and co-author David Pogue dub the father of handheld computing. The involvement of such dynamic firms as Casio, Tandy, GeoWorks, America Online, Intuit and various venture capitalists makes the story all the more interesting. We from getAbstract recommend this book for its straightforward - although not all too objective - account of the creation of a modern technological phenomenon.	2002-06-04

We don't know if feng shui will straighten out your life, but it sure does clean up a room. If you're curious about the interior design style/life philosophy that's sweeping the U.S., Karen Rauch Carter's book is the perfect place to start. She explains the ins and outs of the ch'i, gaus and bagaus that can completely transform your job, your bank account, your relationships and your happiness, according to the feng shui doctrine. The book is written in a casual, unpretentious style that helps to offset some of the grand notions of the concept. We from getAbstract recommend this book to anyone curious about the theory that is remaking kitchens across Hollywood.	2002-05-22

Tom Wilson's premise: Employee incentives are just as important to corporations as they are to employees. Why? Because a company that aligns its own achievement with that of its employees is well on its way to success. Wilson uses a wide range of case studies to bolster his common- sense advice, including reminders that your employee rewards plan should be simple to understand, geared toward the kind of people you want to attract and should frequently vary. Even the most experienced manager can stand to learn a thing or two from Wilson's keen analysis of Amazon.com, Southwest Airlines, Saturn, and a host of other successful businesses. We from getAbstract think that you owe it to yourself - and to your employees - to read this well-crafted book.	2002-05-22

Authors and consultants Ravi Kalakota and Marcia Robinson emphasize that the mobility revolution is in its early stages and provide insights on its anticipated stages of development.

The gang at PricewaterhouseCoopers discusses the chief financial officer's role in the changing corporate landscape. The eCFO is no longer only involved with financial management, but must become an internal venture capitalist, opportunity seeker and risk taker who works closely with the CEO to anticipate trends, recommend new enterprises and manage company investments as a portfolio of financial ventures. The authors draw on in-depth interviews with leading CFOs, case studies, independent research and analysis of the latest best practices. Though charts, bullets and boxes impart a textbook flavor, and the trend material is a little familiar, the book is generally solid and informative. We from getAbstract suggest it to CFOs and CEOs who need that \\"e\\" awareness, or to any manager who is trying to drag the boss into the 21st century, or even the 20th.	2002-05-14

That's the easiest way to describe this book, which compiles essays written by the ultimate management guru from 1991 to 1994. All of theses essays are about change: changes in the economy, society, business and in organizations in general. Drucker's advice on how managers should adjust to these tectonic shifts centers around the rise of the now ubiquitous knowledge worker and the global economy. As always, Drucker's analysis is far enough ahead of the curve that his 90s-era observations and conclusions are still relevant in the 21st century. We from getAbstract recommend this seamlessly organized book as the perfect introduction to one of the most important management thinkers of his generation.	2002-05-14

The phrase, \\"stochastic differential equations\\" may not trip off your tongue and you may not initially see the joy of learning that replicating portfolio value = mV + B. Yet Tom Copeland and Vladimir Antikarov guarantee that their book is a practical, everyman's guide to the sometimes serious math world of Real Options Analysis (ROA). Thanks to the availability of personal computers and modeling software, everyone can now use ROA. Before PCs, only doctoral students of finance or economics would have been safe attempting it. Sure, ROA is harder than the traditional valuation methods or Net Present Value (NPV), but real options allow you to understand the full value of an asset by taking into account the factors of flexibility, risk and uncertainty. Company case models, the theory behind ROA and equations are all showcased in the book. This can be a challenging text, but we from getAbstract strongly recommend it to all CFOs and anyone charged with evaluating business strategies.	2002-05-14

Hundreds of books in the last decade have documented the need for companies to develop the ability for rapid change. In Creative Destruction, Richard Foster and Sarah Kaplan make the case by suggesting that companies must emulate markets by abandoning some of the very operational practices that enable them to survive and adopting a mindset of ruthlessly efficiency. Markets, the authors explain, reward exceptional performance and instantly punish - and often destroy - laggards. Therefore, the only way to compete with markets in terms of stock price performance is to mimic markets in terms of operation. We from getAbstract recommend this book for the insight imbedded in this basic analogy, but adds two caveats: 1) Some of this advice is too general to be of immediate, practical use, and 2) The fact that the authors chose Enron to illustrate many of their basic points unfortunately undermines the strength of some of their arguments.	2002-04-15

Douglas Lamont, a member of IBM's Mobile Computing Marketing Advisory Board, argues that wireless will completely supplant the fixed-wired Internet and will be the dominant way to surf, purchase and talk to your friends. Lamont even goes so far as to suggest investments: Nokia, Japan's DoCoMo-AOL alliance and wireless infrastructure firms. He even explains why Europe and Japan lead the United States in wireless \\"m\\" (for mobile) commerce - because the U.S. has been slow to adopt a national wireless standard. We from getAbstract recommend this tech-literate book to anyone at all curious about the future of wireless technology and its implications.	2002-04-15

Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism celebrates the underlying principles of capitalism: reason, independence and just plain selfishness. Donna Greiner and Theodore Kinni lay out the fundamentals of Objectivism and attempt to describe how you can integrate its beliefs into your life and your business. The book is written in the spirit of Rand's own outlook: It is anchored in practicality, well organized and goal-oriented. Even so, some executives might lose patience with the philosophic nature of the work. We advise such readers to move on. However, we from getAbstract recommend this book to intellectually curious readers in search of a moral, ethical, or even philosophic foundation for their business life.	2002-04-15

Mike Kwatinetz and Danielle Kwatinetz Wood, a father-daughter team, have written a readable volume of investment advice that will impress you with its fundamental soundness, if it does not dazzle you with buzzwords and newfangled formulas. With advice that flies in the face of the mantra of portfolio diversification, Mr. Kwatinetz shows how to narrow your portfolio and thereby compete with Wall Street professionals. The authors warn you away from the minefields sown by short-term thinking and guide you toward making that big stock-market score you've been hoping to achieve. The volume's Q &amp; A sessions with stock market gurus are interesting, but appear to be afterthoughts. We from getAbstract recommend this book to regular investors and Wall Street insiders alike.	2002-04-08

Lucal, a probate judge in Erie County, Ohio, describes how to implement early estate planning in order to make the best financial choices for yourself and your family. She begins by discussing the need for estate planning based on identifying your goals and your net worth. She suggests ways to preserve your estate while taking state laws into consideration. Lucal discusses the probate process and helps you prepare for it. One by one, she explains various estate planning tools, such as annuities, charitable donations, gifts, insurance, retirement plans, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, wills, property deeds, trusts and disability planning. getAbstract appreciated her wrap-up of seven key steps for setting up your own estate plan.

Every so often, the language of consultants seeps into general use throughout the business world and beyond. This is certainly the case with the phrase \\"value driver,\\" which in the late 1990s became ubiquitous in corporate conference rooms. But how many of us have actually given detailed thought to what value drivers actually are, how they should be identified and managed, and how they should fit within the confines of your overall corporate strategy? Luckily, Roger Morin and Sherry Jarrell have given this subject more than enough thought to rescue a concept in dire danger of slipping into clich&eacute;. Warning: This is not a breezy, skim-it-in-an-afternoon, how-to book. If you don't crunch numbers, this is not the book for you. However, we from getAbstract do recommend this book to anyone willing to grapple with its equations and graphs. They're not too painful, and even if the strategic concepts are not entirely innovative, they do add weight to some overused and poorly understood business jargon.	2002-04-08

Authors Joel Stern and John Shiely advocate a total revolution in the way companies are valued and measured. They make a convincing case for using EVA (\\"Economic Value Added\\") as the primary measure of corporate performance. The authors argue that the SEC's yardstick for corporate reporting, the \\"Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures\\" (GAAP), was designed to protect lenders by depicting a company's liquidation value. As such, GAAP provides an overly conservative and only marginally accurate picture of financial health. EVA principles - at least according to the consultants who advise companies on using them - evaluate intangible assets more realistically and correspond more closely to stock market performance. We from getAbstract recommend this book to executives who seek improved corporate financial and market performance, and to investors interested in understanding how value is created and maintained.	2002-04-08

Most businesses in the world today are owned by families, but only a small percentage of these companies will survive and grow into major corporations. The unique challenges posed by family ownership can undermine even the best-performing small business, as issues of control and succession permeate the generations. In Generation to Generation, the authors apply the simple premise that managing a family-owned business to a large extent means managing the family itself. To that end, they provide a rich compendium of research and strategic suggestions for those charged with making a family business work, including the consultants who guide them.  We from getAbstract highly recommend this book for these applicable measures and methods, which will help the performance of both business and family.	2002-04-01

Throughout the 1990s, consultants were the kings of business and one firm, McKinsey &amp; Co., reigned above all others. In The McKinsey Mind, Ethan M. Raisel and Paul N. Friga, former McKinsey &amp; Co. consultants, describe the methods that the famed firm uses in improving the performance of its consultants. These techniques, which relate to problem solving, management and communications, combine to produce the equivalent of a basic MBA textbook. But unlike much of your grad-school reading, this one is right on target to address your real-life business executive. As such, we from getAbstract recommend this book not just for its McKinsey cachet, but for its applicable approaches to business.	2002-04-01

Perhaps no political leader in the United States is more widely respected than Colin Powell, decorated soldier, architect of the 1991 U.S. victory over Iraq, former presidential contender and current Secretary of State. Using anecdotes and quotations from Powell's life, management professor Oren Harari distills leadership philosophies and methods that can be applied to business. The book is written in a short, pithy style, reflecting Powell's own direct approach. While the principles Harari uncovers are not innovative, they are comprehensive and practical. Charged with maintaining an international coalition in the ongoing war on terrorism, Powell has been thrust into one of the world's most important leadership roles. For this reason alone, we from getAbstract recommend Harari's book for its insight into the man's leadership philosophies, which have had a profound influence on U.S. military and government organizations.	2002-04-01

When you hire a corporate biographer, the result should be thorough, imbued with inside knowledge and, perhaps, a bit flattering. And so is this book, which was commissioned by Corning in conjunction with the firm's sesquicentennial celebration. As the title suggests, the focus of the book is on the innovational nature of the company and how Corning has capitalized on its creativity through flexible strategic responses to changing market demands. Although the corporate origins of the book cast doubts on its objectivity, we from getAbstract recommend Corning and the Craft of Innovation as an interesting case study in the management of a company that lives and dies with innovation.	2002-04-01

In a world overloaded with spin, the only way to cut through the bull is with the truth. So say the authors of Beyond Spin, which advises executives to allow their corporate communications staff to act as internal investigative journalists. The authors maintain that only by revealing the truth within your organization can you hope to guide the flow of information about and around your company in the digital era.

Identifying the common threads in these two groups, he comes to a simple conclusion: To win in the modern marketplace, companies must combine traditional management techniques with cutting-edge methods and technology.

Nothing could be further from the truth with regard to What the Future Holds, a compelling compilation of possible future scenarios written by experts in population, climate, energy, labor, government, monetary policy and information.

Ideas and messages spread through human communities in the same way that viruses jump from person to person and group to group. This premise - that social trends saturate populations like contagious epidemics - is an intriguing foundation for a book, and indeed, Malcolm Gladwell's examination of the theme is at times a fascinating read. The book is at its best when applying the epidemic theory to marketing by attempting to identify the key individuals that help transmit a trend, or for that matter, a disease. However, Gladwell never quite succeeds in knitting these observations into a cogent and coherent argument. The book reads like a set of notes - some of which come off as unnecessary digressions. But on the basis of those sections that truly illuminate the cycle of trend dissemination, we from getAbstract recommend this book to marketing, advertising and promotional executives.	2002-03-20

Part of the art of being a CEO is managing to be just interesting enough to hold people's attention without offending any listeners or revealing too much. Of course, there is much more to it as well, like exercising authority, setting clear standards and maintaining your integrity. Jack Welch's fairly conservative autobiography proves that the irascible Welch mastered all aspects of this difficult discipline, especially the first. Don't expect to learn juicy details of Jack's divorce or to get an insider's political view of the horse race to select his successor. Nevertheless, this memoir might be the closest you ever get to answering the question, \\"What made Jack Welch tick?\\" Despite some bland moments, we from getAbstract contend that anyone who wants to understand the American corporate landscape should read this book - so once again, Welch delivers.	2002-03-20

M&amp;A tycoon Bruce Wasserstein has not just studied the high-stakes world of corporate mergers &amp; acquisitions, he's lived it. As head of M&amp;A at First Boston and then as leader of his own firm, Wasserstein has played a role in many pivotal corporate marriages. In these pages, Wasserstein comprehensively examines the hows and whys of history's largest deals. While skirting the fundamental question of whether mergers &amp; acquisitions enhance or depress shareholder value over the long term, Wasserstein conveys an overwhelming amount of information about the dynamics and tactics that define M&amp;A. The book is enormous and encyclopedic, so it might serve better as a reference text than a straight-through read. We from getAbstract strongly recommend this book for both its compelling historic accounts of Wall Street's most important deals and deal makers and its detailed breakdown of how the game actually works.	2002-03-20

This is a handbook for those who are eager to become sales masters, but are asking themselves, \\"What do I do next?\\" \\"How do I deal with a procrastinating client?\\" or \\"How can I effectively present my product?\\" Hopkins conveys instructions and suggestions through a variety of sales conversations. The author, a master salesman, is obviously enthusiastic about helping others succeed in sales. His strategies, which are based on seminars he teaches, include steps for organizing and writing a successful sales presentation. He also provides strategies for closing sales. The information could be more compact and less repetitive, but it is logical and sometimes even funny. We from getAbstract recommend this book to people involved in all levels and aspects of sales.	2002-03-20

A Whack on the Side of the Head is a book that deserves some time. If you rush this book, you will miss much of its value. Roger von Oech uses a combination of explanation, puzzles, and irreverent artwork in his treatise on creative thinking. People who consider themselves creative will instantly take to this book. People who don't feel they are creative may be a little intimidated by the format of the book, but if they can buckle down and force themselves to give it a chance, they stand to gain the most from the book. Reading this book can help you reawaken the imaginative thinking process most people abandoned in their childhood.

Wess Roberts draws on the life experiences of the leader of the Mongol hordes to craft imaginative monologues on leadership - an attribute as valuable today as when Attila united the Huns in 415 AD. The advice is general. Its effectiveness probably depends on how well you apply it, although the idea of a historic icon of barbaric vengeance counseling us in cultural sensitivity seems a bit of a stretch. While the treatment is certainly colorful, you might worry about ways some modern-day chieftains could misuse Roberts' principles to justify their own Visigoth approach to management. We from getAbstract recommend this book to those looking for new and interesting ways to approach the perpetual management issues of team-building, inspiring loyalty, setting goals, and achieving objectives.	2002-03-20

But when the words in question come from the pen of Microsoft's chairman, businesspeople and technophiles the world over rush to read them in search of whatever enlightening morsels might be hidden within. Indeed, the strength of this book, which sometimes reads like a Windows operating manual, is not in the grace of its prose. Rather, its value lies in the glimpse it gives of the world through the eyes of one of its richest and most influential men. As Gates sees it, the migration of data to the electronic state from paper was the seminal event of our age, and his book gives his take on its implications - hardly an irrelevant picture coming from the head of the world's dominant software company. We from getAbstract recommend this book to any executive charged with developing a digital strategy.	2002-03-20

Instead of speed reading text, Paul T. Tieger and Barbara Barron-Tieger tell you how to speed read the personalities of those with whom you work and play. This book ably explains the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. With a little practice, you can quickly identify your own personality type and that of anyone you meet. If you are already familiar with the Myers-Briggs model, much of this book will be old news. If you aren't familiar with it, and if you want to learn how to \\"SpeedRead\\" people according to this theory, this book will benefit you. The authors go into great detail about the four temperaments and the sixteen personality types within them. We from getAbstract recommend this as a book for purposeful study. However, even if you only read it once, you will learn something about yourself or the people around you.	2002-03-20

In this seminal work, Daniel Goleman introduced millions of readers to the concept of emotional intelligence - the amalgamation of psychological skills and traits that he claims accounts for 80% of success in life. Skills like self-awareness and self-motivation are instilled (or destroyed) in childhood, but Goleman claims that even adults can learn them and apply them to marriage, business and education. This book is at its best in making the general case for EI by providing a sound biological underpinning. Although later sections on real-world application cannot keep up in terms of insight, we from getAbstract strongly recommend this important book, which is relevant not only to business life, but to life itself.	2002-03-15

Dean LeBaron has crafted an insightful volume that is part travelogue, part cultural analysis, and part memoir. The resulting book will bring you up-close and personal with the forces that shaped the two great cultures of Russia and China. The text is adorned with vignettes, anecdotes, parables and humor that keep the read as entertaining as it is weighty. We from getAbstract strongly recommend this book to anyone looking to understand two countries that have greatly influenced the last century of human history and will play a central role in the next.	2002-03-15

Organizations spend vast amounts of time, money and energy to recruit and hire top executives. Then those same companies let these new valuable employees sink or swim totally on their own. A new receptionist is likely to receive more attention than a new division manager, as author Diane Downey explains. Despite its jargon-laden title, this enlightening book will change the way you think about hiring or being hired. We from getAbstract recommend this book to any manager who hires, who is being hired for a high-level job or who would like to be.	2002-03-15
1619265:US	45273033	R2QP89QZ11DISF	1587990717	866674811	Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in the Markets and in Life	Books	5	13	20	N	N	Packed with Knowledge!	The past decade has witnessed the release of many books about risk management and assessment, but none have managed to illustrate the role that random events play in life and markets as well as Nissim Nicholas Taleb's latest work. Writing in a leisurely and personal style that makes his complex subject utterly accessible, Taleb instructs us on how to account for randomness in our decision making, and illustrates the many ways in which we confuse luck with skill. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book, which many investors will wish they had read in, say, 1994.	2002-03-15

If you read only one book about the looming genetics revolution, As the Future Catches You would be a pretty good pick. After laying a foundation with a basic introduction to DNA and the genetic sciences, Juan Enriquez takes the reader on a tour of the mystifying advances that are putting humans in greater control of their own evolutionary destiny. This book is designed as much to inspire questions as to answer them, and uses a variety of font styles and sizes and almost poetic prose to provoke the thoughtful involvement of the reader. We from getAbstract recommend this book to any reader who doesn't want to let the future catch him off guard.	2002-03-08

Dembo and Andrew Freeman explain how to weigh the basic elements of risk management - time horizon, scenarios, risk measure and benchmarks. They write in a direct style to appeal to the general reader, and they include numerous charts and tables to illustrate their basic principles and examples. While their mathematical reasoning may be difficult for less expert readers, it is an essential element of the book, since creating mathematical models is at the heart of risk management. With this caveat, we from getAbstract recommend this well-researched book to executives who make corporate decisions and to serious investors.	2002-03-08

Perhaps the reason that Alvin Toffler's classic book feels so relevant some 25 years after its initial publication is the fact that he wrote it in a time which, in retrospect, was not so different from our own: The world was trembling before the threat of terrorism embodied, in Toffler's age, by Iranian terrorists, and radical new technologies, in the form of powerful and increasingly affordable computers, were drastically altering business and society. But probably, the book resonates simply because he was right about almost everything. For that reason, we from getAbstract recommend this book as a basic requirement for any professional.	2002-03-08

At first glance, this book may look like just another tediously detailed behind-the-scenes guide to picking stocks. But the delightful surprise concocted by authors Charles M. LaLoggia and Cherrie Mahon is the book's page-turner narrative and laugh-out-loud wit, which they often use effectively to nail critical points. The authors focus on how to spot and invest in undervalued companies. We from getAbstract recommend this book to investment professionals (hey, the way things are going, a few fresh insights can't hurt) as well as to anyone, including Sunday speculators in need of a good laugh.	2002-03-03

Buyout maven Rick Rickertsen has written the ultimate guidebook for anyone with an eye on purchasing a company. Despite the complex nature of buyout deals, Rickertsen covers everything, except what to wear when the deal is done. He writes about financial issues in remarkably understandable language and with great flair. We from getAbstract  recommend this book to anyone considering participating in a management buyout (which used to be called a leveraged buyout, until the process got a bad reputation) or being swept along by one.	2002-03-03

Charles C. Poirier and Michael J. Bauer assert that the future of the American company will resemble an Internet version of the Japanese Keiretsu, interlocked firms within firms. This new value chain constellation - which shares buying, selling and customer information in real time - will offer advantages and services that no single company could ever hope to match working solo. We from getAbstract predict that this will become a necessary textbook for any CEO or CPO who wants to maximize profits via supply chain optimization.	2002-03-03

This solidly researched and written guide shows you how to move into the next phase of e-business operations: actually making them profitable. The authors call this era .profit (dot profit), and aside from that little gimmick, the book is refreshingly free of space-filling babble. Instead, it concentrates on the elements needed to make a profit on the Internet, and gives plenty of examples from cyberspace so you can learn from those who are already in .profit world. We from getAbstract recommend this book to anyone charged with developing business strategy.	2002-02-22

Barrow's book about nothing is far more interesting than most books about something. In fact, this leading mathematician and cosmologist's book is an irresistible grand tour through science, philosophy, math, the arts and the far reaches of the universe. Barrow writes with clarity and sophisticated wit about the concepts of nothingness, the value of zero and the scientific impact and importance of the vacuum. We from getAbstract recommend this book to everyone - now you have nothing to read.	2002-02-22

Despite the tens of millions dollars now being invested in new customer relationship management solutions, customer satisfaction with service dropped almost eight percent from 1994 to 2000, according a study by the University of Michigan's business school. Consultants Anderson and Kerr suggest some reasons why: a failure to distinguish between CRM strategy and CRM technology and a tendency to view meaningless data as useful information. We from getAbstract highly recommend this concise and thorough examination of CRM to all managers and students of business.	2002-02-22

Harrison Owen's book has its share of shortcomings, but there is certainly something to recommend here as well. Owen's explanations of organizational change, complex adaptive systems and chaos theory as they apply to business and innovation are lucid and easy to understand. Less appealing are his lapses into jargon that seems more appropriate to a yoga class than a human resources department, and the theoretical tone that permeates the book. We from getAbstract recommend this book to anyone in search of an alternative perspective on modern management.	2002-02-22

Geoff Hiscock profiles Asia's top 100 billionaires in this fascinating overview of the region's economic landscape. The first half of the book examines the Asian economy, setting the stage for the later depictions of the Asian rich and famous. Hiscook's in-depth reporting shines, as does his conversational style.

Jack Beatty combines his own analyses with writers' essays, articles and other materials to chronicle the American corporation from its inception in the 1600s through the present. His overall conclusion seems to be that corporations are a source of more evil than good, but don't let this bias throw you - this collection of sometimes brilliant writings is captivating reading. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book to all students of business history, especially those whose views of the corporate colossus tend toward the darker side.	2002-02-18

This informative, well-researched and brightly written overview of government e-business will fill you in on how far governments worldwide have come in offering services via the Internet, and what more they have to do to make the most of what the technology has to offer. It's a fascinating read that highlights the Internet's incredible power in bringing people, causes and issues together in the name of social activism, politics and democracy.

The knowledge management craze may be passing right before our eyes, but Chris Collison and Geoff Parcell do a good job explaining what's behind all the hype. Although a bit dry in tone, the authors manage to capture the critical elements of KM and explain the whys and hows as they relate to individual businesses. Despite a somewhat sterile presentation, we from getAbstract recommend this book as a thorough introduction to knowledge management theory and practice.	2002-02-18

Bob Davis' book is vastly superior to many CEO memoirs in its clarity, simplicity and sophistication. While much of his \\"Internet-is-changing-everything\\" spiel will seem rightfully dated, his core point - that speed has become a critical organizational imperative - will hit home with anyone competing in business today. We from getAbstract recommend this book more for its advice about building cultures of speed than for Davis' dot-com tales.	2002-02-18

Absolut provides a rare behind-the-scenes look into the Madison Avenue minds who are able to manipulate the critical faculties of America as surely as if we'd all downed a double shot straight up. In short, the book details how advertisers were able to fabricate a brand out of a product that consumers could not distinguish from the competition in taste tests.

Nalebuff understand that some business relationships are complementary, not competitive. Complementary relationships allow you to profit from another company's products or services. For example, a computer company can sell more hardware when a complementary company sells more software. The authors illustrate this clearly written book with examples of the strategic thinking and negotiating behind successful and unsuccessful game playing. You could cut to the chase by reading the capsule summaries, but we [...] advocate studying the examples if you plan on playing with the big kids.	2002-02-08

Even if you've never heard of the Money Honey (CNBC reporter Maria Bartiromo), she and her peers in the financial press have affected you. The reporters, analysts and so-called financial experts that have become ubiquitous in our society do much more than report on what's going on in the markets - they drive the markets. The problem, according to media reporter Howard Kurtz, is that this commentator class often doesn't understand what they're talking about, and sometimes has a vested interest in the very markets and stocks about which they pontificate.

We should state up front that this is not an impartial book. Author Thomas Siebel, CEO and founder of Siebel Systems, extols the values of \\"eBusiness\\" (his coinage, apparently), which just happens to be his company's specialty. But at least Siebel Systems - unlike a lot of dot-com companies - has thrived and remained profitable. Siebel contends (arguably based on enlightened self-interest) that companies must either employ new eBusiness tactics or perish. Using profit reports and return-on-investment studies as back-up material, he makes a pretty compelling customer-first argument that we [...] recommend to anyone who's interested in the future of business.	2002-01-29

The successful businesses of the future will be those that revamp their marketing strategies to appeal to this mother-of-all demographic groups, Popcorn says. She then lays out a fairly comprehensive plan for doing just that. Rich with case studies of gender-based marketing principles in action, the book is witty, intelligent and convincing.

Tom Coens and Mary Jenkins pull no punches: They hate performance appraisals. They explain why in their book, which also traces the development of the appraisal method and analyzes why companies have stuck with a tool that simply doesn't work. Although the authors tend to redundancy, their writing is clear and engaging, and they support their message with passages from major business leaders, scholars, consultants and researchers. Old hands might view their suggested alternatives as pie-in-the-sky solutions to employee management and motivation, but we [...] recommend this book to optimistic managers who believe that there must be a better way.	2002-01-29

Bob Thomas presents a fascinating history of the Disney entertainment empire, with a special focus on Roy Disney's role in the company's growth. While Walt Disney was the creative genius (although he never drew a single picture of Mickey Mouse), Roy Disney provided the solid financial foundation, got the loans and made the deals that made Disney profitable. Thomas mixes the Disney brothers' personal history with an overview of the Disney Company's creative and financial expansion, as they balanced creativity with practical business fundamentals. This personal and corporate saga illustrates the value of a company's commitment to both a central driving purpose and core values. We [...] recommend this lively, engaging, entertaining read.

His explanation of arcane markets will be understandable to the lay reader, although the details may be hard to follow if you don't have a solid grounding in statistics, math or economics. Our one wish would be for more attention to the aftermath and the unprecedented bail-out orchestrated by U.S. financial regulators. But even in light of this shortcoming, we [...] recommend this fascinating real-life market saga to general and business readers, and to anyone who ever comes anywhere near the financial markets.	2002-01-29

Trading offers remarkable rewards and attracts many new entrants every year. Most rookie traders are sure that there is a relatively easy route to the crock of gold at the end of the rainbow. Veteran trader John Hayden, who has traded stocks, gold and U.S. Treasuries since 1976, disabuses his readers of any such notions; there is no way to short-cut the system. The book is divided into two sections: The first offers a sort of trader's self-improvement manual and concentrates on developing the attitudes needed to be a successful trader. As in many books within the personal growth oeuvre, this advice often consists of reiterating the glaringly obvious in condescending fashion. The second half is the more technical, and will be of more interest to the novice or intermediate-level trader, to whom we [...] recommend this book for its original observations and conclusions.	2002-01-29

Paul Ormerod's critically acclaimed work pinpoints the failings of traditional economics and government policy making by demonstrating the complex nature of economies and societies. You won't find a single dry, dusty page in this dazzling book, which serves as a primer to the latest thinking in 21st-century economics. Ormerod's premise: Standard economic theory fails to take into account the fact that people are influenced in their decision making by other people. This interaction forms the foundation of his butterfly economics. Ormerod keeps you turning the pages and brings the subject vividly to life. We [...] recommend this newly penned classic to all readers.	2002-01-29

Let's face it, a lot of people in business had no intention of ending up in business when they were studying in college. Corporate cube-mazes are riddled with liberal arts majors turned middle management. It's time for many of you non-business majors to admit your secret weakness: You can't read a financial statement. Now that it's out in the open, take a deep breath and dive into Ken Langon and Alan Bonham's business finance primer, which will teach you to mash numbers with the best of `em, or at least fake it as well as anyone else. All the basics are covered here: earnings, margins, cashflow, liabilities and assets. The book also provides a thorough rundown of other financial ratios that executives, analysts and investors use to measure performance. Don't let the financial terminology or the slightly British-tilting jargon put you off. We [...] recommend this book to anyone in business who feels that gaps in your financial education have placed you at a disadvantage to your MBA-toting peers.	2002-01-29

Columnist, consultant, and best-selling author Rhonda Abrams has written a clever and enjoyable book that compiles the simple wisdom of motherly advice into a basic primer on ethical business behavior. Without offending the mothers of the world, this isn't a book to read if you're looking for real-world management technique. It is however an entertaining and sometimes inspiring collection of aphorisms that is especially compelling when presenting luminaries like Southwest Airline's Herb Kelleher expounding on the virtues taught them by their own moms.

Many books have been written about how to organize your life, your workspace and your home, some good, some bad. We gravitate toward authors that provide practical systems for bringing order to debilitating chaos. This is not one of those books. Mike Nelson instead writes of the psychological reasons that some people allow clutter to overtake their lives.

What it lacks in originality, the book makes up for in thoroughness. Rich provides lists of \\"action words\\" for use in resumes and cover letters, a review of likely interview questions, a description of four different resume formats, an exhaustive list of self-inventory questions, and topical advice from employment experts. The writing is uninspired, but novice job hunters probably aren't looking for breathless prose.

John Rothchild has written a fascinating biography of one of Wall Street's most successful and least-known investors, Shelby Davis, who turned a $50,000 initial investment in 1947 into $900 million, almost exclusively by buying and selling insurance stocks. Part character study, part Wall Street history, Rothchild's book reads like a novel, with an accessible and witty narrative. Of special note is the concise summary of Davis' investment strategy, which rivals Buffettology in its simplicity and common sense. In Rothchild's hands, Davis' life becomes a fun read, no matter what your business interests, and we from (..)recommend this book to all curious readers.	2002-01-29

There's no rocket science here, but the simple wisdom that Lois Levy doles out might just spark an epiphany. This is common-sense stuff (sleep, play, laugh, quit worrying) that you'd think it would be impossible to forget, even though we all do.

In this series of questions and answers, personal finance guru Suze Orman presents her basic program of personal finance management. Her foundation is debt management and she touches on many other important basics, including retirement planning, insurance and mutual funds. Orman writes for financial novices - if you have a solid understanding of finance, read this book for enjoyment, not education. But if you're still looking to get your financial house in order, this bestseller is a great place to start. We [...] recommend this book to all financial beginners, and especially applaud Orman's unique take on how finances affect relationships, and vice versa.	2001-11-21

Knowledge management sounds impressive over the water cooler, but what exactly is it? We advise you to spend some time pondering this question before you invest a single dollar on KM systems or consultants. A great place to start is this introductory text by Thomas M. Koulopoulos and Carl Frappaola, KM consultants extraordinaire. Starting from square one, the book defines knowledge management, identifies the theories behind it, explains its critical components and examines implementation strategies and results. Of course, any book reflects its subject matter, so this one is thick with jargon and heavy with somewhat abstract concepts like open culture and continuous renewal. The ultimate return on current knowledge management investments remains to be seen, and for that reason we [...] recommend this detailed explanation to any executive who might one day find himself faced with a critical decision about KM strategy.	2001-11-21

The detailed appendix includes the U.S. Fair Credit Reporting Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. This book is primarily targeted to small business owners, employees and the unemployed or underemployed who are having debt problems.

Kiley covers the Bug's marketing history, from the obtuse (managers didn't understand that it was essential to VW's U.S. identity) to the brilliant (its sales renaissance).

Editors Dan Holtshouse and Rudy Ruggles bring together 14 experts on knowledge management, including Peter Drucker, Alan Webber of Fast Company magazine and Stephen Denning of The World Bank. The best thing - and worst thing - about this compendium is that it is an anthology. Positively, it serves the unique purpose of offering an introduction to different views. If something piques your interest, you can investigate it further. But, unfortunately, you may be disappointed by a problem endemic to anthologies: lack of in-depth analysis. The book's four sections focus on the role of knowledge individually and strategically (in two theoretical chapters) and on knowledge's role on an organizational and economic level (in two more practical discussions). This is not a \\"how to\\" book about leveraging intellectual capital. Instead, we [...] recommend it as a brief history of the evolution of knowledge in the context of the working world.	2001-11-19

Dan Steinbock gives you a riveting look at one of the most important companies of our time in an elegant, storytelling style. His text is rich in detail and seems to capture every conceivable perspective on every possible event in Nokia's 140-year-old history. Writing almost at the level of a fictional narrative, Steinbock adroitly takes you through the company's highs, lows and pivotal moments from its origins in the timber industry in the 1860s and the merger in the 1960s that first gave it an electronics division, to the suicide of its influential CEO in the 1980s. It's all here, along with Nokia's strategies and values.

Editor David Colbert collected a multitude of printed source material - diaries, private letters, memoirs and articles - that spans 400 years, and, as the title promises, provides plenty of accounts from eyewitnesses to Wall Street. Organized chronologically, the book also includes Colbert's timelines and his original introductions for each piece. Divided into sections that reflect every era, the book is an insightful and often hilarious romp through financial history. We [...] recommend this book to all readers - there's something here for everyone, even if you don't think you give a hoot about the stock market.

Presented as the story of a turnaround manager getting tutored by an empowerment mentor, the book establishes the fundamentals of the (now ubiquitous) theory of empowerment in a conversational and enjoyable style.

Fletcher and Kelley Olwyler examine how you use paradoxical thinking - contradictory ways of approaching a situation. Then, they discuss ways to use your paradoxes to your strategic advantage. You can use their \\"pendulum\\" to help you recognize the positive and negative ways you express these paradoxes - so you can apply the positive actions to difficult situations. They invite readers to analyze themselves and resolve a current problem. The book can help you devise more creative solutions to personal and work situations. However, while the system is fairly straightforward, elements do seem complicated and may be difficult to apply on your own.

Randy Charles Epping has written an easy, informative overview of the world economy that roams from central banks to black markets to derivatives. His premise: Most people don't get much out of their studies of basic economics because the material is presented an abstract, obscure and confusing manner. His goal: Bring the real world into the study of economics.<br />He addresses 77 basic economic concepts using neat, short textbook definitions. Don't look here for insights into current debates about globalization, for they are not addressed. But advanced readers might still find some value in this book as a quick resource in which to find quick answers to simple questions about economic systems and structures.

James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner's remarkable guide debunks the myth of the leader as a maverick rather than a team player. It also tackles the image of the leader as a special breed. Indeed, the book's basic premise is that there are certain critical and identifiable skills that most anyone can learn and adopt in order to become an effective leader. The authors spell out these skill sets, and list the guiding principles that leaders should follow and represent to their organizations. The seminal book is a mile deep and a mile wide.

Lets start out this review by stating up front that we disagree with Daniel Ben-Amis assertion that a preoccupation with risk measurement and management is a detriment to the global economy. With that out of the way, we can say that Ben-Ami presents a unique analysis of the modern global economy that is not at all without merit. His contention that lagging growth is a greater peril to the worlds economy than financial instability is reasonable and backed up by ample evidence and illustration. And his position that increased regulation could be doing more harm than good will be embraced by all free traders. On the basis of these discussions alone, we [...] recommend this book to anyone thinking seriously about international financial systems. But this book is perhaps most useful as a starting point for debate, which it will certainly generate in the mind of any informed reader. While you might quibble with Ben-Amis conclusions  as we do with his assertion that the threat of the 1990s financial crises was overblown  you will not be bored.	2001-11-07

In this impressively detailed and exhaustively documented book, John K. Cooley gets to the roots of the international terrorist organizations that are striking fear and violence into the world&#8217;s populations. Beginning with surprising revelations about U.S. and Soviet actions in Afghanistan during the Cold War, Cooley traces the origins of today&#8217;s terror back to the West&#8217;s strategy of creating an army of fanatical Muslim warriors to mire the USSR in its own Vietnam. While that plan was successful, it gave birth to the terrorist violence we face today, and Cooley deftly explains how.

According to Patrick Lencioni, they fall prey to common temptations that distract them from their only true responsibility: producing results. The temptations, like the tendency to focus on career status over corporate performance, boil down to very human weaknesses. You won't necessarily learn any real success secrets here, but the reminder to keep these dangerous propensities in mind and under control will be valuable to all executives. This book has gotten rave reviews for its powerful simplicity and vivid prose, but we think the slim volume would have been more effective if it were made even slimmer by cutting out the fable that frames the CEO advice. But nevertheless, we [...] recommend this book as fast and easy reading for CEOs or, likelier, for those still climbing the corporate ladder.	2001-11-06

As such, executives must learn a new set of skills that focus on creating, strengthening and maintaining relationships.

From the caveman to the man in pinstripes, he covers it all in a journey that also includes plenty of wit and wisdom. Delving deeply into societies of every era, the book's strength lies in its context and insight. Donkin even provides a good \\"a-ha!\\" or two in each chapter, you know, those moments when you smile, nod and say, \\"Oh, so that's where that comes from.\\" We [...] highly recommend this book to all workers, from hunter-gatherers to CEOs.	2001-11-02

If you're thinking about entering into a partnership, you're probably too close to your new venture to be able to see the pitfalls clearly - much like the early stages of a romance. The \\"partnership is like a marriage\\" theme may seem a trifle hackneyed, but when something is basically true it tends to get repeated. Azriela Jaffe's straightforward, easy-to-read book includes checklists you can use to see if you're really ready for partnership. You need objective advice to face the reality that you are entering a relationship that, no matter how exciting in the beginning, holds real potential for turning ugly later. This book will help you navigate territory that may be more hazardous than you think. We [...] recommend it to entrepreneurs who are considering a partnership, as well as to those wearing their current partners around their necks.	2001-11-02

In this comprehensive history of the modern state, author Martin Van Creveld weaves together disparate threads and illuminates hidden connections in forceful, energetic language. Thus, his book is both scholarly and entertaining. Van Creveld takes a generally dim view of governments and the state. The greater the state's power, the more he regards it as a monstrosity, and he's not shy about saying so. The anti-government political right will like this book, but Van Creveld's greatest contempt is reserved for nationalism, militarism and the state at war, which ought to entertain the left. He sees the state as a dubious, archaic institution and, as his narrative shows, his position transcends notions of conservative and liberal. Readers are likely to think of their nations differently after reading this book, which we [...] recommend primarily to students of politics and government and policy makers.	2001-11-02

Froehlich has written an informative and highly readable guide to understanding the emerging global economy. Never dry, dull or dense, his book focuses on the factors that combine to create both major and minor global economic trends. If you understand these trends, he maintains, you can make wise investment choices now and in the future. At the end of the book, Froehlich includes a glossary of terms, though - unlike many investment books - you don't find yourself lost in a sea of insider jargon while reading. He writes delightfully, easily shows you how global trends connect and conversationally explains what this means to you professionally and personally. We [...] recommend this book to all readers, since no matter your area of expertise or interest, if you live on this planet your economic well-being is affected by globalization.	2001-10-31

Expanding on the groundbreaking concepts first presented in Market Driven Strategy, George S. Day presents a detailed illustration of what a market-driven organization looks like and how it operates. This practical book provides many specific suggestions that executives can implement to get their companies in tune with their customers and their markets. Day also presents contrasting examples that show blunders, setbacks and outright failures among companies that stubbornly retain inward-looking cultures. This book joins Day's earlier work as a classic in the management field and we [...] recommend both books to business people at all levels.	2001-10-30

Suze Orman captures the vast psychological and spiritual ramifications of your financial condition. She realizes that the reason so many of us do not get our financial houses in order has nothing to do with income and expenses and a lot to do with insecurity and fear. Tackle these and the rest comes easy. Well, maybe not easy, but getting over the initial inertia is the hardest part, as millions of dedicated Orman followers can attest. This book, her investment classic, is replete with case histories, psychological insight and practical financial advice. This advice covers the basics of retirement planning, estate planning and insurance, as well as less quantifiable areas like piece of mind. Her writing style is warm, clear and quick to read. We [...] strongly recommend this accessible book to anyone who is not a money manager, and even to the professionals who find that their technical financial skills are not satisfying their non-fiscal needs.	2001-10-30

As the title implies, this book gives you the tools you need - in the form of information and tactics - to negotiate effectively. No matter what line of work you're in, you'll benefit from the negotiation principles, strategies and styles that Roger J. Volkema presents in an easy-to-read format. He includes exercises that you can use to test your comprehension of the material and to start developing your skills. His chapters on ethics and cross-cultural negotiations, while general, provide an intellectual starting point for further investigations. This book will give you a basic foundation for effective negotiation, but if you're in a business that demands the skill, you'll want to follow up with some more advanced reading and training. Nevertheless, we [...] recommend this book to anyone who feels a little overwhelmed whenever they find themselves across the table from a negotiating adversary, whether it's your boss, an employee a customer or - gulp! - your spouse.	2001-10-30

Even when he's not at his best, as is the case in The Pursuit of Wow!, Tom Peters is head-and-shoulders above any other management guru. Peters is all about simplicity and excitement, both in his language and in his message. His basic mantra never changes: The workplace is becoming ever more competitive, so you need to make yourself and your company stand out. Do this by viewing your work as a series of critical projects and injecting limitless enthusiasm into each one. In delivering this consistent message, Peters tosses out scores of common-sense lines that are so insightful that you just have to jot them down. You'll find quite a few such keepers in this book, but you won't find too much of an overriding theme. Instead, Peters presents a string of 210 observations that flow together loosely. If you want to get going , we recommend this motivational booster.	2001-10-30

Rattiner guides you through the basics of setting up your business. While he doesn't teach you how to be a financial planner - that would be an entirely different book - he does cover everything else you need to open your office, including an explanation of the education and certification process in the U.S.. He shows you how to create a business and marketing plan, how to deal with clients and understand their needs, how to comply with regulations and how to protect yourself legally.

In this compilation edited by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter technical strategist Rick Bensignor, a dozen financial experts discuss their individual approaches to technical analysis of the stock market. In the first chapter, equities, options and futures trader Linda Bradford Rasche explains swing trading and the underlying principles of technical analysis, thus providing an important primer for understanding the theories in the rest of the book. This is a complex read, since technical analysis involves using various mathematical systems to examine market trends and swings. Those who follow the market closely will find this engrossing, but amateurs could be daunted. We [...] recommend the book to serious students of the markets - It's not for the casual browser or those who are not mathematically inclined, but its targeted readers will be quite satisfied.	2001-10-26

One of Robert Shook's first bits of wisdom for salespeople is that enthusiasm is contagious. He proves this in his latest book, which crackles with his own palpable excitement for the topic of sales and the anecdotes that he's compiled to illustrate his points. He peppers his introductions with slang and cliches. Oddly, this is a plus, making the writing honest, human and real. The book is simply and concisely organized. Shook wants to entertain as well as inform his audience.

Copious strategies for becoming a salesmanship champion fill the pages of Tom Hopkins' book. This is a handbook for those who are eager to become sales masters, but are asking themselves, \\"What do I do next?\\" \\"How do I deal with a procrastinating client?\\" or \\"How can I effectively present my product?\\" Hopkins conveys instructions and suggestions through a variety of sales conversations. The author, a master salesman, is obviously enthusiastic about helping others succeed in sales. His strategies, which are based on seminars he teaches, include steps for organizing and writing a successful sales presentation. He also provides strategies for closing sales. The information could be more compact and less repetitive, but it is logical and sometimes even funny. We from getAbstract recommend this book to people involved in all levels and aspects of sales.	2001-10-24

As a result, some spend more time at the office, where they are confident and capable. To remedy this dilemma, Tom and Julie Hirschfeld, a husband-and-wife team, offer a class you won't find in an M.B.A. program: Fatherhood 101. Presented as an executive briefing for a new assignment, Hirschfeld's book teaches you to apply your business know-how to achieve parenting success. The concept is long overdue, though the book skims over the crucial topic of maintaining life-work balance and is prone to gender stereotypes. getAbstract recommends this handy guide to working fathers and fathers-to-be.	2001-10-24

Cynthia Crossen presents a one-thousand-year pageant of fortune, focusing on how nine wealthy men - and one woman - gained and kept their wealth. Each person symbolizes an era, and a means of amassing money. Crossen combines their biographies with a discussion of the historical trends that contributed to the changing sources of wealth - from the ancient days when thievery and conquest were the way to riches to the times when trade, manufacturing and new technologies provided the roads to wealth. The book provides a fascinating and leisurely overview of history, as well as a glimpse of the lives of these wealthy people. The discussion sometimes wanders in time and place, with asides comparing different time periods. We [...] recommend this engaging, briskly written book to executives, managers and anyone fascinated by wealth, history or both.	2001-10-24

Author Steven Provenzano provides concrete, practical advice for assembling a resume for both personal review and electronic scanning. His ideas are simple and easy to implement, and are presented in plain, direct language. Interestingly, some of these concepts, especially about the length and layout of a resume, go against the conventional wisdom of resume writing and so are especially valuable. We [...] recommend this solid primer on resume preparation, which is also a useful reference for experienced job hunters who may find ideas and inspiration from other people's resumes. Executive job seekers from the mid-level manager on up should find this book useful in their quest for a better use of their talents and time.	2001-10-24

M&amp;A tycoon Bruce Wasserstein has not just studied the high-stakes world of corporate mergers &amp; acquisitions, he's lived it. As head of M&amp;A at First Boston and then as leader of his own firm, Wasserstein has played a role in many pivotal corporate marriages. In these pages, Wasserstein comprehensively examines the hows and whys of history's largest deals. While skirting the fundamental question of whether mergers &amp; acquisitions enhance or depress shareholder value over the long term, Wasserstein conveys an overwhelming amount of information about the dynamics and tactics that define M&amp;A. The book is enormous and encyclopedic, so it might serve better as a reference text than a straight-through read. We [...] strongly recommend this book for both its compelling historic accounts of Wall Street's most important deals and deal makers and its detailed breakdown of how the game actually works.	2001-10-23

In the book that gave birth to the self-help genre, Dale Carnegie spells out his plan for getting what you want from other people by changing the way you behave. Carnegie developed these principles by drawing from examples of persuasive people in history, like Abraham Lincoln, and from his own experiences. Since Carnegie wrote his book in 1935, many of his examples will of course seem dated, but his basic principles are timeless, eminently useable and presented in an easy-to-read and personal style.

Don't look here for flowery prose; this is an academic accounting of the modern history of Afghanistan and the origins of the Taliban movement. In a flood of chronological detail, Michael Griffin traces the political evolution (or devolution) of the country from the 1973 fall of King Zahir Shah, through Soviet occupation and horrifying civil war, to the birth and victory of the Taliban. Playing a central role in this history is Osama Bin Laden, whose presence in Afghanistan severely muddied an already bleak environment. Griffin is even-handed in his analysis - misogynistic Taliban, expansionist Pakistanis and disingenuous U.S. administrations all receive sharp criticism.

A loyal employee will always show up bodily, but committed employees direct their minds and spirits to the organization's goals. Therein lies the premise of James R. Lucas' compelling and original book. To truly motivate a workforce, he proposes, you must appeal to something deeper than performance reviews, employee manuals and monetary rewards. You must harness the passion of your employees to the goals of your organization. In other words: Lead don't manage. While some experienced (dare we say cynical?) managers might grow impatient with the slightly fuzzy, optimistic tome of Lucas' book, the bottom-line commandment that managers should consider the goals, devotions and beliefs of their employees when choosing tactics for motivating a workforce cannot be disputed. We [...] recommend this outstanding treatment of the nature and nurture of employee motivation to anyone who stands higher than the first step in the reporting line.	2001-10-18

Aaker discusses how a brand can be managed as a strategic asset and a source of competitive advantage. The companies whose work is described at length include Saturn, General Electric, Kodak, Healthy Choice, McDonald's, and many others. Aaker shows how a brand should be considered as a product, a person, an organization, and a symbol. The book is an excellent in-depth approach to the many facets of brand development. However, it sometimes tends to go into extensive detail about slight differences in concepts and definitions, and it is written in a generally dry, academic style. But, the book offers excellent basic principles you can apply to improve your brand. We [...] recommend this book to everyone involved in marketing.	2001-10-18

Why do some people try so hard to please others that end up pleasing no one - including themselves? Harriet B. Braiker anchors this phenomenon in early childhood problems, such as guilt or low self-esteem, and shows how it harms adult relationships, including those at work. Although she emphasizes interpersonal relationships off the job, executives, managers and employees at all levels will still find her book helpful in life and in work. Braiker describes three primary manifestations (compulsive behavior, distorted thinking, and avoidance of negative feelings) of being a people-pleaser, and notes that this problem can stem from a personal mind-set, a habit or an intense aversion to conflict. Most helpfully, she explains strategies for more productive behavior. Sometimes the explanations and self-help quizzes become repetitive, but her examples keep the book's pace flowing. Thus we [...] recommend this book as - dare we say it? - a real crowd pleaser.	2001-10-17

Day's book originally appeared a decade ago, but it reappears now with a theme that has since become a management mantra - let the market drive your business. While many newer books enumerate the basics of business strategy, the examples that Day culled from the likes of Otis Elevator, GE, Ikea, Acuson and 3M still illustrate the fundamental themes as well as any. The book's one shortcoming is its academic tone, which might be expected from an author who is also a professor, but nevertheless might try the patience of some business professionals. Despite this one flaw, we [...] recommend this book as a straightforward exposition on business strategy that has truly stood the test of time.	2001-10-17

Fox brought wit and common sense to his simply written, How to Become CEO. His similarly popular How to Become a Rainmaker is written in the same enjoyable style, but the book disappoints in the end, lacking the practical insights of the former title. It's easy to understand the appeal that's placed this book on the best-seller lists. It's a quick and painless read that touches on all the basic rules of sales and does provide some intriguing conversational techniques to apply to your own pitch. But Fox's plain prose can do little to mask the fact that his sales advice is so basic that even inexperienced sellers will already know many of these things intuitively. Nevertheless, it won't hurt - and it definitely won't take much time - to breeze through this book as a refresher course in salesmanship basics, and we [...] would even extend a recommendation to entry-level salespeople to spend an evening with this pleasant but obvious book.	2001-10-16

Companies that embrace work teams quickly discover a basic truth: More teams mean more meetings. Management experts laud the benefits of enlightened teamwork, but they spend much less time dwelling on the often long, sometimes pointless and nearly always inefficient meetings that teams breed. With teams fast becoming a fixture in the corporate world, meeting management, or facilitation, is becoming a critical skill for anyone with executive ambitions. Author Ingrid Bens' definition of a facilitator is quite specific - someone who guides a meeting without actually participating in discussion or decision making - but her book is filled with practical advice that any professional can apply when running a meeting. A host of charts, examples and worksheets (not to mention the accompanying CD) help illustrate her process for steering meetings without controlling or directing the outcome.

At first glance, Judith Bardwick's influential book, first published in the early 90s, seems scarcely relevant in the opening months of the 21st century. After all, the sense of corporate entitlement that she documented was certainly swept away in the layoffs, restructurings and reengineerings of the last decade, right? Of course, anyone working in a large organization today knows that's not entirely the case. Bloated bureaucracies still exist. But more importantly, Bardwick's simple observation that external economic environments influence and even create internal workplace environments is just as true today as it was the day she wrote it. So too are her words of advice about managing and harnessing employee fear to motivate a workforce into a productive mindset. That said, not all of Barwick's observations have aged so well. For example, you'd be hard pressed to make the case today that the work ethic has died in America. Nevertheless, we [...] recommend this book not as a slice of management history, but as a relevant and practical discourse on employee motivation.	2001-10-15

Companies that succeed have made effective, positive communication part of their culture. Dialogue is a two-way street and negative, ineffective dialogue can kill a company's prospects. Isaacs, a corporate consultant with a doctorate in philosophy, uses a very un-businesslike style to convey his ideas.

Mary Beth O'Neill describes how executive coaches need to work with executives as partners to help them become better leaders. Coaches need the strength to share the truth with clients in times of crisis, she explains. She discusses the core principles that underlie coaching and the four essential phases of the coaching process: contracting, planning, live-action intervening and debriefing. The book is primarily directed to coaches, including consultants and internal or external trainers, who facilitate processes and projects in organizations. While it has its share of fuzzy and jargon-laden patches, the book is generally clear and to the point. It includes a mix of examples, charts, and step-by-step techniques, plus useful chapter highlights. We [...] recommend this book to coaches, to executives who are coaching employees and to executives who are being coached.	2001-10-11

India's recent leadership in information technology and software design is just one facet of the country's economic transformation and re-birth. Journalist, former CEO and Harvard graduate, Gurcharan Das was born in India shortly before its independence. He moved to the United States in the 1950s, then returned to India as a marketing executive. Das deftly weaves history, cultural commentary and astute economic insight into a page-turning tale, and then brings it to life with the connective tissue of his personal story. We [...] were spellbound by his splendid book, which details India's emergence into the global economy, while delving deeply into why it took the country so long to come into its own.	2001-10-10

This volume, based on a PBS documentary, is as much about the unique characters who drove the evolution of business as it is about vast historic trends. Author Howard Means blends the color of a cinematic treatment with the rich context and detail of a comprehensive history. In so doing, he's accomplished the ultimate historian's goal: Presenting history in such a way that it is clearly relevant to modern-day life, and in this case, business. From biblical moneychangers to the miraculously large pool of Microsoft millionaires, Means traces the history of commerce from the perspective of power, asking who acquired it, how they amassed it, how they used it and what became of it? We [...] recommend his intense narrative to anyone in business, since business is about money, and money is, after all, power.	2001-10-09

Frank shows step-by step how you can improve your communications skills by using a 30-second message. While we all often gab for minutes or hours, you should be able to get your point across within 30 seconds. The rest is simply preparation or follow-through. The techniques of crafting a 30-second message will help you focus your thinking, writing and speaking. Using these techniques, you can also be more effective in conducting meetings or speaking to groups. This skill will give you better all-around results in business. The technique has three main steps: identify your objective, know your listener and find the right approach. The author shows how to build the most effective message and then tells you how to present it to an audience. The last chapter shows how the 30-second message can be used in other forms of communication, from business letters to sales pitches and press conferences. We [...] recommend this clear, concise book for business people or professionals who want to get their ideas across more effectively, particularly in public speaking.	2001-10-08

Part of the art of being a CEO is managing to be just interesting enough to hold people's attention without offending any listeners or revealing too much. Of course, there is much more to it as well, like exercising authority, setting clear standards and maintaining your integrity. Jack Welch's fairly conservative autobiography proves that the irascible Welch mastered all aspects of this difficult discipline, especially the first. Don't expect to learn juicy details of Jack's divorce or to get an insider's political view of the horse race to select his successor. Nevertheless, this memoir might be the closest you ever to get to answering the question, \\"What made Jack Welch tick?\\" Despite some bland moments, we [...] contend that anyone who wants to understand the American corporate landscape should read this book - so once again, Welch delivers.	2001-10-05

For a book that tells you not to send a resume, the author spends an awful lot of time telling the reader how to write resumes (or \\"resu-letters\\") and what to do with them next. Don't be fooled by the clever title. Jeffrey J. Fox hasn't banned resumes, he simply wants you to understand how to write versions that will work for you. He explains what to do - and not do - to land a terrific job. In bite-sized chapters that get right to the point (in a book so small you could fit it into a leprechaun's briefcase), he guides you through job-hunting research, planning and marketing the product of you. Some of what he offers is innovative; some is standard, common-business sense. Even if you only dig out a few gems, we [...] note that this is a fine place to begin your job search - and a very fine place for job search beginners.	2001-10-05

If you believe that successful leadership can't be codified, Colonel Jay W. Spechler, Ph.D., would beg to differ. A management consultant and professor, the Colonel clearly describes the traits of a successful leader and then details what such a leader must do to guide a strategic planning initiative. Having pinned his model for success to a board like a butterfly, he describes how 18 organizations changed through strategic planning under strong leaders. The Colonel's organizations vary from large corporations - American Airlines, AT&amp;T and Ritz Carlton Hotels - to nonprofit, trade and governmental organizations - a local school board, the United Services Automobile Association and the U.S. Air Force. He nails down and organizes the major elements that make a strategic initiative work. We [...] recommend this book as a refreshing change from the general run of works on theoretical strategic planning. Thanks to his focus on the human and organizational face of leadership and change, Spechler is our new favorite Colonel.	2001-10-04

Every \\"road-to-success\\" book has some sort of gimmick that sets it apart from the many others in the genre. Chris J. Witting Jr.'s offering is a 21-day exercise regime designed to transform your personality, catapult you up the career ladder and pave over financial potholes. Witting asks readers to devote just a few minutes per day to his program, with each day devoted to a different aspect of getting your life on track. Naturally, that's a lot of ground to cover. But the inherent drama of the countdown to the end of the three-week cycle does keep your interest, thereby encouraging you to take the exercises seriously. And once you've taken that leap, the book does present some intriguing ideas on how to overcome inertia, simplify a cluttered life and harness your existing network of contacts. The instructions are easy to follow and the writing takes a pleasing, matter-of-fact tone. We [...] recommend this book to anyone interested in personal improvement, especially those who have been left less than fulfilled after falling for other \\"successful\\" gimmicks.	2001-10-03

When Holy Cross College invited NBC News correspondent Maria Shriver to give the 1998 commencement address, she almost refused. Although she is a niece of President John F. Kennedy, she was almost terminally afraid of giving speeches. But to our benefit, she changed her mind. This charming little book is her response to the flood of requests she received after her speech aired on C-SPAN. In an expanded version, she explores each of her \\"ten things\\" through commentary and illustrative experiences from nearly twenty-five years as a network news journalist. She also draws on her personal life as a daughter, friend, wife, and mother. Intimate, clever, funny, and wise, this life lessons book is also an insider look at the media.

Harry S. Dent, Jr.'s book is remarkable both for the overall accuracy of its predictions and for the simplistic model upon which those predictions depend. Written in 1993, it claims a niche within the general family of \\"trend\\" books written by the likes of Alvin Toffler and John Naisbitt. The work anticipated our current era of super bullish markets, which it predicts will continue through 2007. The crystal ball drops a few items, given that a few years have passed since publication. Nonetheless, it offers a clear macroeconomic forecast and investment tool. If you sense the Fed just doesn't get the New Economy, this is the book for you.

The theory of co-active coaching that provides the title for this book makes sense: By making the interaction between coach and coachee a relationship of equals, both parties will feel less constrained by pre-assigned roles, and thereby freed to learn from another. Unfortunately, the rest of the book fails to live up to the promise of the initial intriguing, yet common-sense idea. Specifically, the coaching methods and tools described by the authors never progress beyond generalities that basically amount to this: The client already has the answers, the coach just has to bring them out by being curious and creating a safe place where the client can be honest and take risks. However, we [...] do recommend this book on the basis of a few features, like the excellent sample dialogues and illustrative hypothetical examples, which provide simple but valuable lessons to managers, consultants, teachers and all manner of would-be coaches.	2001-10-03

But this is a rich, moving and powerful book for anyone who is open to its message. While the language is a little overblown, the basic message is truly profound. The authors have identified a clear path to a way of life that enriches the person, the people around, and the world at large. For principle-centered living, it is critical to focus on activities that are important, and not just urgent. We must learn to live by the compass of principles instead of focusing on the clock. We must also have the humility to understand that importance is defined by principles that are larger than our values. Don't focus on urgent activities. Focus instead on important things - first things. Set principle-based goals. Try to do the right thing, for the right reason, in the right way. Focus on working with others to create win-win situations. Not everyone will be willing to live the humble, giving, and spiritual life, but for those who are, this book is all but unassailable. We [...] recommend this book to everyone in business.	2001-10-02

Although it attempts to predict the future, it is not a trend book. Rather, it is an attempt to figure out how society will be organized. Jensen analyzes trends only in the context of determining whether they have a place in the new global business model called the dream society. Anyone with an interest in understanding the personal and business paths that will exist in the future will find this book valuable. Anyone actively engaged in a global business will find this book invaluable in charting 21st century inflection points.

Paula Peisner Coxe's Finding Time is more inspirational than instructive. As the sub-title suggests, the book is aimed at would-be super-moms, and Coxe does a commendable job addressing the demands that stretch women thin both at work and at home. The book itself will fit nicely into a tightly packed schedule - it's arranged into 36 short chapters, each with its own focus. Within those chapters, harried women likely will find some comfort in seeing that others share their familiar woes. What they won't find are new ways to deal with their troubles. Some of the timesaving tips that Coxe offers: Use an answering machine to screen calls and turn off your cell phone when you don't want to be disturbed. These techniques hardly qualify as innovative, and neither, in truth, does her writing. Coxe actually uses the line, \\"Elephants remember, people don't.\\" Really. Nevertheless, we [...] recommend this book to any woman who feels that she might not be able to keep up much longer. For that group, Coxe's book offers an important message - You are not alone.	2001-10-02

Dr. Marios Kyriazis gives you a crash course in anti-aging, complete with the specifics you need to begin a healthy path to a life of increased wellness and longevity. These tips on preventing age-related complications and antidotes to the impact of aging are particularly useful for busy, stressed-out professionals who have days when they feel 20 years older than they actually are. The author, a leading British physician and founder of the British Longevity Society, beautifully explains complex medical processes, He is clear and offers great detail, so you don't have to be a doctor to understand everything he writes. If you are under 25, and therefore invincible, you aren't ready for this book yet, but we [...] heartily recommend it for the rest of us.	2001-10-01

Not too many philosophers have taken a serious crack at explaining what the advent of the Internet means to the future of human society. While technology takes a back-seat to spirituality in The Global Brain Awakens, author Peter Russell takes all the recent hype about global interconnectivity to a fascinating extreme: The Internet as the central nervous system to a newly evolved global organism. Russell draws parallels between the development of the central nervous system in living organisms and creation of Web communications here on Earth, which he argues is the biggest living organism of them all. Unfortunately, this intriguing line of thought is undermined by the book's conclusion, which collapses into a mire of hokey higher consciousness that lacks the same critical reasoning. We recommend this book to anyone interested in an alternative vision of a Web-enhanced future, provided you are not turned off by its new age clich&eacute;s.	2001-10-01

Bell thinks that the future relationship between the managing and the managed will resemble a partnership, and at the core of this partnership will be mentoring. In Managers as Mentors he describes the ideal relationship between mentor and prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Unfortunately, Bell's description of the \\"magical dance\\" of mentoring is perhaps the book's weakest offering, composed mainly of amorphous passages related to things like \\"synchronization and synergy.\\" When Bell narrows his focus to practical advice, however, the book begins to shine. His insights into how to give advice and ask questions, although aimed at the mentor/prot&eacute;g&eacute; interaction, will be useful to readers in many other situations. For that reason, we at  [...] recommend this book to executives and managers who want to be mentors, any student or professional that might someday be in the market for a mentor, or anyone who wants to pick up some common-sense communication pointers.	2001-09-28

These are hard skills that are fast becoming critical requirements in the new, dynamic economy, and in order to develop them, you might have to look in some new places for help. That's not to say that many professionals won't be left rolling their eyes at some of the more alternative of the many alternative notions advanced in this book.

In the interests of safety, we'll refrain from quoting this fine book by Deborah E. Bouchoux, a specialist in intellectual property who teamed with AMACOM to create that rarest of volumes: a straightforward book about law that is simple to read (it's a formula she should patent). This comprehensive volume covers the nuts and bolts of U.S. patent and trademark law. It also gives advice on how to protect your intellectual property and avoid infringement, and reports on the latest patent trends in high tech. Of most concern for general business managers, Bouchoux reviews how (and why) to conduct intellectual property audits within your organization.

Whether you're trying to close the sale, woo the girl, or just strike up a conversation, nothing works better than simply making the other person feel great. Author Aye Jaye describes his techniques for doing just that, by bestowing compliments, planning surprises and doling out gifts. The Schmooze is effective at everything from improving your standing with your boss, to getting a better hotel room or talking your way out of a speeding ticket. The book is written in an easy-to-read style, which very much expresses Aye Jaye's own personality, as if he is schmoozing the reader, too. And therein lies the only problem. Some of Jaye's favorite lines seem long and hokey, and some of the suggestions he offers - like sliding a waiter a dollar bill at the start of a meal while saying, \\"You are number one with me and there's more coming at the end of dinner.\\" - bring to mind another Yiddish word, \\"Schmuck.\\" But you needn't resort to such extreme schmoozing, and we [...] recommend that you read this book for its original take on the power and method of the world's oldest business technique.

Ray Kurzweil, an inventor of new technologies, discusses how today's rapid advances in computer intelligence will eventually lead to machines that are more intelligent than human beings. He suggests that these machines also will develop human sensitivities, leading to an increased blurring between machines and humans. Drawing on the latest developments in science and technology, Kurzweil presents a fairly compelling argument, though some readers may find the discussions hard to follow since he frequently cites physics, biology and other scientific disciplines. Kurzweil is trying to simplify a complex theoretical and technical subject, so we [...] forgive the occasional repetition of his main arguments, and recommend this fascinating, well-researched and well-reasoned book.	2001-09-26

The metaphor of the stress-free mind as a still pond encapsulates the message of David Allen's best-selling book. When a stone is thrown into a pond, Allen points out, the size of the ripples correspond with the size of the stone, and getting the ripples of your mind to correspond with the size of the tasks on your to-do list is the essence of stress-free living. But you don't reach Allen's placid pond via a quiet Zen-like path. Instead, you calm the waters of your mind by building and maintaining a rigid organizational system that's so efficient that you never have to worry about any task once it's been fed into the machine. The popularity of this book probably owes as much to the stress level of the book-buying public as it does to the level of innovation to be found in Allen's organizing machine. The actual time-management techniques offered up by Allen can get lost in fancy jargon and fall short of his general observations about stress, productivity and the mind. But we [...] recommend this manual for a productive life to anyone looking for help in dealing with stress - you're sure to end up with a fresh notion or two in your in-box.	2001-09-26

One hundred and seventy millionaires can't be wrong, can they? Probably not. That's why you should pay close attention to the simple wisdom of Charles B. Carlson's book, which analyzes the investment habits of 170 members of the seven-figure club. The results: Millionaire investors buy fundamentally strong stocks, pay little attention to market timing, never trade on news and maintain a dedicated buy-and-hold philosophy. Carlson straightforwardly presents these financial principles for a financially unsophisticated audience, complete with lists of organizations and companies to contact for further investment information.

Covey shows how you can become a principle-centered leader, and how you can use principle-centered leadership philosophies to more effectively manage people. Principle-centered power is created when the values of the follower and leader overlap. Control is apparent, but it is not external; it is self-control. It elicits a willingness to risk doing the right things because they are valued and modelled by the leader. People follow the leader because of who he or she is. This book is full of lists, charts, diagrams and anecdotal examples to help the reader fully comprehend the ideas contained within. The cover of the book has the famous quote, \\"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.\\" This quote encapsulates the intentions of the book. Covey wants to teach you how to fish. And he wants you to know it's not as simple as picking a lure and casting. Good fishermen learn through years of applying their skills. Managers become good managers through years of applying principle-centered leadership. We [...] recommend the book to managers and executives at all levels.	2001-09-26

The Wild West days of the dot-com craze are behind us, but e-business strategy remains a largely uncharted frontier. In fact, e-commerce seems more bewildering than ever, now that many of the strategic maxims that the Internet bubble was built on have been proved false. To help you get a handle on the revolutionary technology that has survived the collapse, Nirmal Pal and Judith M. Ray have collected articles by researchers and executives, including many from their home base, the e-Business Research Center at Pennsylvania State University. This anthology constitutes a solid and well-researched book, which has sufficient gravitas (and jargon) for an academic and enough practical information for an entrepreneur. The multiple authors sometimes overlap as they dissect various e-business approaches, but all offer worthwhile ideas. We [...] recommend this book to executives at any company, since Internet technology is now ubiquitous, and distinctions between old economy and New Economy are fast falling by the wayside.	2001-09-25

What you see inside depends entirely upon your political leanings. Put simply, if you think that the United States played the role of the villain in the Cold War, you'll likely see this book as an enormously detailed, highly researched look at what the U.S. government would probably prefer you didn't know. If you think the U.S. was the defender of democracy, you'll probably see it as more blathering from an unrepentant Bolshevik. Either way, this book was significant when published early in the post-Cold War period and certainly illuminates several of the shadier policies ever undertaken by the U.S. government. As such, we [...] suggest that any well-read and well-informed person in either the professional or academic world acquire a working knowledge of the arguments made by Chomsky in this book, in order to decide on their merits for yourself.	2001-09-25

People need creativity, fantasy, passion and caring, argues Alan Briskin, and when they're deprived of those things at work, there's trouble ahead. Briskin's book works well as a study in modern-day alienation. Tracing the loss of soul at work to scientific engineering, he summarizes various research findings that will seem like old college friends to those with business degrees. But the book sags when it sets forth into the land of the soul, where Briskin gets fuzzy, unfocused, repetitious and just plain hard to understand. In addition, he never actually gets around to telling us how to get soul back at work. Nevertheless, we [...] recommend this book to managers, employees and students with a desire to look deeper into the balance of hard work and personal satisfaction, and the patience to wade through the sometimes trite.	2001-09-21

While Napoleon declared that God favors the side with the most battalions, author Victor Davis Hanson suggests otherwise. Hanson reasons that the side marching to preserve a great moral cause  e.g., the defense of individual freedoms against the agents of human oppression  possesses the true soul of battle. Seen in this light, war becomes far more than a duel of logistics, technology and strategy. Hanson believes that victorys first seeds are sown in the human spirit, and the terrible battlefield harvest is collected later. He provides three historic examples: Theban general Epaminondas destruction of Sparta, Union General William Shermans march through Georgia and U.S. General George Pattons demolition of the Third Reich. In this well researched and almost poetically written volume, Hanson reveals the basis of democratic countries military dominance. We [...] recommend this book to military professionals, students of military history and those who seek a deeper understanding of the strength of democratic societies.	2001-09-21

Murrell and Mimi Meredith illustrates the vogue concept of worker empowerment as it relates to real-life business, devoid of the touchy-feely clich&eacute;s such nomenclature may evoke. The book cannot completely avoid a collapse into idealism and jargon however, and long sections of several chapters amount to cheery descriptions of the motivated and satisfied employees that empowerment will breed. These breezy passages fortunately are grounded by examples of companies like Toyota and AT&amp;T that have embraced empowerment - or portions of it - to great success. So if employee-burnout is an issue in your office, or if you are looking for an easy-to-digest explanation of one of today's most popular management trends, we [...] recommend this book to you.	2001-09-21

Weintraub and some of the most successful people trading on the Chicago markets today. Like the trades, the information flies fast and furious, and one trader's ideas may completely contradict another's. But most seem to agree that the keys to successful trading are discipline, psychological stability and a solid understanding of risk management. You will succeed in the Chicago markets if you keep your cool and stick to your system, no matter what's happening. This chat-happy book offers many perspectives, ideas and experiences from extremely knowledgeable sources. The uninitiated reader might find it difficult to follow some of the more jargon-laden discussions and the initiated reader might find the chattiness to be disturbing or irrelevant. But regardless of which category you're in, we [...] recommend this book as a valuable introduction or a helpful trade manual.	2001-09-20

Author Marc Rosenberg provides one of the first books devoted to strategies for developing organization-wide, online learning. He goes beyond the obvious technological challenges of Web-based training to explain that technology and content are meaningless without a culture of learning. But creating this culture means confronting dramatic strategic, organizational and political issues. In this roadmap for building and sustaining a learning culture, Rosenberg offers an essential balance between the structure of e-learning (design and technology issues) and its implementation (acceptance and support issues). His book is an impassioned wake-up call to all executives who are concerned about the future of their organizations. To begin building your company&#8217;s culture of learning, ... arm yourself with this practical, yet philosophical, manual &#8212; a weapon for professionals on the front lines of the revolution in workspace learning.	2001-09-19

Honestly, there are not too many books in the personal investing genre that we'd recommend for serious investment advice. But if you're a serious investor considering a venture into short-term trading (formerly known as day-trading), you'll benefit from the wisdom, mind-boggling detail and dizzying array of charts presented here. Tom Dorsey likens good investment advice to a sports playbook that a coach can follow through the twists and turns of the game. The plays and strategies that they outline will be valuable for novices, but we [...] figure that they will challenge trading veterans as well. You need to do some homework (like following the indices and making charts) to work with this book. Dorsey and crew urge you to learn stock-market basics, govern your emotions, understand the psychology that drives investors and avoid common mistakes, like investing based on trends and hot tips. And, don't mind their sports jargon; it's just a framework to make the uninitiated feel comfortable.	2001-09-19

Authors Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine offer the second edition of their extremely popular 1984 chronicle of the birth of the personal computer. They recount how the PC industry began, who fueled its growth and why things happened as they did. The central stories cover the emergence of MITS, IMSAI, Apple, Tandy and Microsoft. This second edition adds the development and maturation of the hardware and software industries. Apple and Microsoft's sagas still dominate, but new stories emerge, including tales of Dell, Oracle, Netscape and the Internet. The second edition shows how the PC child has grown up. You'll see how the nerds took a hobby and reformed the world using Boolean logic, integrated circuits, motherboards and chips. We [...] recommend this book to everyone with an interest in the computer industry and particularly to those who are hungry for the real stories behind the growth of the 20th century's most pivotal industry.	2001-09-19

In his preface, author David J. Teece promises a theoretical framework for understanding intellectual property and practical advice about managing it. Theory ultimately prevails in this book, but valuable nuggets of managerial guidance await any entrepreneur willing to dig for them. As a professor and as the presenter of Oxford's Clarendon Lecture in Management Studies, from which this book is drawn, Teece naturally tends toward abstract thinking. Some of the territory has been traveled before (i.e. the message that bureaucratic, hierarchical organizations tend to stifle innovation) but Teece adds a lot of intriguing material. We [...] believe analytically minded academics, entrepreneurs and executives will find Teece's volume illuminating, most notably his educated perspective on antitrust activism in the high tech arena. He concludes that government regulators should probably stick to regulating industries they understand. Well, if they want to understand intellectual property, they should start here.	2001-09-19

Lampooning a book that steps beyond science and into the realm of spiritual healing would be easy. Many readers won't have much trouble accepting the notion that your mind can heal your body, but it probably will be harder to accept Dr. Larry Dossey's assertion that your mind can heal other bodies just as well. In fact, many readers will scoff at the idea that all minds are linked in a global consciousness that can be harnessed to accomplish tasks like curing AIDS. However, as the good doctor notes, trying to influence reality with the power of thought amounts to... well, prayer. And millions of Americans who would roll their eyes at a New-Agey term like \\"nonlocal mind\\" pray for each other every day. So if you're put off by the book's preachy tone or its inevitable omission of factual evidence to back up its conclusions, lighten up, or be ready to take a good hard look at some of your own cherished beliefs. We [...] recommend this book to anyone willing to suspend his or her skepticism for just a few hours.	2001-09-18

Edwards Deming's work at your peril. After all, he probably set whatever standard you're using. This volume - revised by the author before his death in 1993 and partially based on his 1950s work with the Japanese  - may strike the contemporary reader as a curious mixture of seminal process thinking and idiosyncratic ruminations on education. Portions read like an artifact of the early 1990s, but in this regard, however, his volume offers a unique perspective on a turning point in American economic history: the shift to the knowledge-based economy. We [...] recommend Deming's volume to any serious student of management thought, and all human resources professionals should familiarize themselves with his work, which set the foundations for many of the transformations now underway in the corporate world.	2001-09-18

Michael Orey begins his thorough examination of the courtroom battles against big tobacco by examining Horton v. American Tobacco, the Mississippi case that launched the mid-1980s barrage of legal attacks on big tobacco and led eventually to U.S. settlements of more than $200 billion. As they read about the assault on Brown and Williamson, cinema buffs may feel they are revisiting The Insider with Al Pacino. The book combines a walk-through of the day-to-day legal procedures and motions with a look into the lives of the major players. This well-written volume presents the tobacco case like an engrossing true-crime story, although some readers may find it has too much detail to hold their interest. We [...] recommend this fascinating book to most general readers. But while executives searching for principles to apply to their own companies may find themselves captivated, they won't find much here that is generally applicable.	2001-09-18

Put on your scuba gear - we're diving down deep. Even though Charles L. Griswold, Jr. writes in a dense, academic style, it is worth swimming through his prose to learn about the remarkable work of 18th-century Enlightenment philosopher Adam Smith. Regarded as one of the fathers of modern economic thought, Smith has been misunderstood for the last century because his ethical philosophy has been overlooked. Instead, economists have drawn attention only to his thumbs-up for free enterprise and free trade. Smith believed neither was worthwhile without ethics, a point some modern economists might profitably revisit. We [...] highly recommend this richly detailed, insightful book to anyone interested in economic, political, or social philosophy.	2001-09-18

Kimball Fisher and Mareen Duncan Fisher document the special skills needed for the new but increasingly common task of managing far-flung work groups. The approaches that they examine are becoming increasingly essential for all managers. Although they explore relevant technologies carefully, their human relations advice is probably more important. The Fishers emphasize the interpersonal and leadership skills that a manager needs to head a virtual team. If you read this book cover to cover, it can seem repetitive, since many of the rules and tips offered in one area overlap with those in other areas. However, the book is designed to allow you to review specific management challenges and technologies, and to ignore areas that are irrelevant to your situation. We [...] recommend this clear, practical work to anyone who leads virtual teams and to the telecommuters and freelance workers who report to them.	2001-09-17

Authors Joseph H. Boyett and Jimmie T. Boyett draw on material written by and about these start-up monarchs and end each chapter with a concise summary of the lessons that a reader should glean from their stories. In addition, they include a useful appendix with summary bios of each of the men and women cited or quoted in the book.

What exactly do the Masters of the Universe do between weekends at their Hamptons estates? While most of us have a vague idea of what investment banking is, businesspeople need a clear understanding of what goes on behind the Wall Street curtain. This book pulls that curtain aside with a systematic explanation of the businesses, strategies and tools of the major investment banks. Parental advisory: The book features a technically complex subject being addressed by a professor in finance. Some colorful anecdotes or engaging examples might have lightened the mood, but this isn't exactly Oprah territory here, and we [...] heartily recommend this solid book. Writing with expertise, Thomas Liaw breaks down the current business of investment banking and examines the changes that are blending the profession with commercial banking and insurance, a process that could reduce the Masters to mere mortal servants of global financial services supermarkets.	2001-09-14

That would be a great lead, except that Benjamin Graham has little to confess. Rather, Graham, considered the father of modern security analysis, tells us about his life, career, and his intellectual passions. He shares his thoughts about a range of issues, and about his experiences. For instance, did you know that he valued his intellectual pursuits more than making money? Or that he was a Broadway playwright? These memoirs are more concerned with Graham's story than with his investment techniques.

Writing in succinct and serviceable language, Jeffrey R. Fox presents profitable information for anyone aiming for the top of the corporate world. Anyone in the work force, at any level, can use and appreciate his litany of commandments. Applying these suggestions appropriately and sincerely will help you succeed in your personal and professional life. Some of the commandments may surprise you. Many of them will make you reflect on what your mother taught you. Frequently, the suggestions challenge and encourage you to make positive life improvements and to enhance your interactions with your colleagues. The author's no-nonsense presentation is an easy read. Each commandment entry is brief and to the point.

Coyote hovers in a hot air balloon over the road, waiting to drop an anvil on the unsuspecting Road Runner. Wile E. puts a grenade in the seat of a toy airplane and ... you know what happens. He becomes the victim of his own diabolical plans. The Road Runner wins every time. Chip R. Bell and Oren Harari&#8217;s book turns a cartoon classic into a wonderful metaphor for today&#8217;s fast-paced work environment. Organizations are changing their cunning competitive ways. Instead of behaving like Wile E. Coyote, they are becoming like the quick, agile, joyful Road Runner. In an amusing style, the authors illustrate their points with cartoons of the famous duo and plenty of plot scenarios and interesting tidbits of trivia. The &#8220;Birdseed&#8221; sections scatter tips to help you and your company make the transition to the wide-open desert of opportunity ahead. Those who grew up with Road Runner will relate to this book immediately.

Timothy Vick is a fairly well known advocate for value investing, but in his latest book, he rolls out the mother-of-all value investors as a champion. In using Warren Buffett as the basis for his easily digestible lessons on value investing - the simple strategy of investing in companies that are currently undervalued by the market - Vick proves that the concept of an engaging investment book is not an oxymoron. By holding up the Buffett example, Vick illustrates the greatest axiom of value investing: Over time, the price of any asset will find its intrinsic value. Buffett clung to this mantra throughout the `90s, missing out on some of the biggest market returns in history. We [...] strongly recommend this book for its clear explanation of how Buffett analyzed the New Economy market and how you can mimic him going forward. Because in the end, he was right and they were wrong.	2001-09-06

He expects the Dow Jones Industrial Average to hit 40,000 by the year 2016, and he stands by his prediction, even in the wake of the stock market down turn. His target doesn't sound so outlandish if you consider that, in order to hit 40,000, the Dow must rise by only 9% annually in the next 16 years. (Investors already have accustomed themselves to much grander annual returns.) However, Elias, an investment adviser, might strike some readers as a bit too cheery. He says interest rates and inflation will remain low for a decade, and he predicts that the developing world will goose profits by buying ever-increasing quantities of products from U.S. companies. Elias also argues that the much-feared backlash from Baby Boomers pulling out of the market after they retire will prove a myth. While Elias' outlook is relentlessly buoyant, we [...] recommend his information to investors and his book's ripe conversational fodder to futurists and analysts.	2001-09-05

Author and consultant Susan Wilson Solovic tells how working women can be more effective in top positions and move up the career ladder. She highlights the differences between male and female styles and cites ways that women often sabotage themselves by showing weakness and a lack of confidence in how they speak and act. Using examples and diverse quotes, she illustrates what women should do to express the power they have, which is the key to being taken seriously as a leader. Solovic challenges many overly optimistic beliefs about how things have changed for women in the U.S. workforce and backs up her assertions with recent statistics and research. We [...] highly recommend this book, which provides a welcome strategic reminder that is clearly directed toward businesswomen - though why call them girls? Oh, that's a little irony from the author or, at least we hope so.	2001-09-05

Mihaly Csikszentmihaly presents a detailed examination of motivation based on a study of a half-dozen groups of people involved in recreational pursuits: rock climbers, composers, dancers, chess players and basketball players. He chose these groups in an effort to understand more fully what motivates people to engage in activities that are extremely challenging or offer few external rewards. Although some of his conclusions may be of interest to executives and managers seeking ways to motivate employees, most readers will find this academic study too detailed. Some of the interview comments are interesting, but much of the book describes survey results, a discussion that non-statisticians may be hard put to follow. Because of this complexity and because of the book's somewhat dense prose, we [...] recommend this 25-year-old reissued classic primarily to scholars or to those who are intensely curious about the nuts-and-bolts of motivation. But any human resources professional or leadership specialist should have at least a passing familiarity with its concepts and contents.	2001-09-05

Elaine Sternberg has written an important, fascinating look at business ethics. Despite its academic presentation, it hooks you right away, and keeps you hooked. She is not fuzzy in her ethical analysis; there is no moral posturing to be found. This book is a practical decision-making guide for businesspeople. Sternberg builds an ethical framework that starts with the fundamental premise that the goal of business is to increase owner value. If an ethical issue relates to that goal, it's one you must address. If not, it's not your problem. Once you've identified an ethical dilemma that you must resolve, Sternberg guides you through a series of intellectual exercises that narrow your options, identify your constraints and ultimately help you arrive at the correct answer. We [...] recommend this book as a seminal introduction to ethical decision making for business men and women that should be read by all and referred to often.	2001-08-31

Pointing out that acquisitions usually devalue the acquiring companies (a loss from which they rarely recover), Sirower delves into management fundamentals and mathematical analyses to get to the bottom of merger and acquisition problems.

Futurist Marshall McLuhan once observed that predicting the future is like driving a car forward by looking in the rear view mirror. With such a navigation system, any prognosticator is sure to make a bad turn or two. Perhaps George Gilder strays off course with the premise: Increasing bandwidth supplies its own demand. Of course, Gilder was not alone in this belief. Companies and individuals bet billions of dollars on business strategies built on this supposed axiom. Perhaps it's just too soon in the technology development cycle for the Gilder's bandwidth-based Telecosm explosion to be visible, but the current bandwidth glut has for now placed companies like Global Crossing - which Gilder highlights in the book -in highly leveraged peril. Nevertheless, exponential increases in bandwidth certainly have the potential to re-shape the future in ways that we can't imagine, but perhaps Gilder can. We [...] would recommend this book solely on the basis of its comprehensive explanation of telecommunications technology, but Gilder's ability to combine this tech-expertise with insightful visions of what this technology ultimately will bring to the world makes this a most satisfying read.	2001-08-31

Brayton Bowen takes a thoughtful approach to understanding the new generation of employees who seem to need rewards and recognition to spur their motivation. He attributes their incentive-based work ethic to workplace changes, such as downsizing and a decline in loyalty, which has tainted the work environment. Bowen proposes a variety of recognition systems, including intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, and he outlines strategies for using recognition to empower the whole person. His in-depth ideas about building motivation through recognition and rewards will appeal to anyone who manages other people, from supervisors to top executives, though he cautions that true motivation can't be bought, but must come from genuine achievement and internal drive. Since Bowen provides a thoughtful context for the workings of motivational strategies, as well offering some hands-on tactics, we [...] recommend this book to managers and human resource professionals at all levels.	2001-08-31

When you think of Apple Computer, does the image of \\"The Rebel\\" come to mind? If authors Margaret Mark and Carol S. Pearson are right, these archetypes should spring to your mind as part of the identification of these brands. The authors assert that people think in a certain subliminal way about companies based on the characteristics of archetypal personalities. Your company, they say, should define the archetype that fits its culture (is your firm an \\"Explorer\\" or an \\"Innocent?\\") and consistently brand its products accordingly. While they quote people seldom seen in business books \\"Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell \\"they insist that their ideas are practical and profitable. If you are an executive who wonders what to do to make your brand stand out, we at recommend this book to you.	2001-08-31

The Fourth Wave attempts to answer this question by looking far out to the horizon of knowable things. Expanding on Toffler's Third Wave, The Fourth Wave analyzes trends that will shape the nature of business in the 21st century. At the forefront of this trend analysis is the consideration of global consciousness, ecology, environmental integrity and economics. The book is written from an academic perspective, so it is not an easy read, but the authors must have sensed this shortcoming, because they use charts to effectively summarize the information presented in the chapters. We [...] recommend this book to anyone who wants a fresh perspective on the role business might play in the future, and perhaps should play today. Executives, change leaders and students will find this book useful and thought provoking.	2001-08-28

Ellis presents brief profiles of 85 Wall Street leaders who contributed to the growth of the world's major financial marketplace. The authors divide these individuals - all men, which tells a tale right there - into four slightly arbitrary groups: masters of investing, movers and shakers, business builders, and wisemen and rascals. The collection is drawn from the other writers' pieces about these men, and includes occasional articles the featured financiers wrote themselves. Apart from a few brief notes about some patterns that the author observed, these excerpts from various sources stand alone, with no overarching theme or exposition. We [...] keenly feel the lack of a few analytical essays that might have pulled the collection together and integrated it thematically, but even so, this serves as a useful research tool and an interesting introduction to a unique confluence of powerful men.	2001-08-28

Jones sound a battle cry against institutional waste. What a pity, they say, that so much time, energy, and money are needlessly thrown away. They urge executives to redefine their values based on customer experiences and to track the flow of value from manufacturing to final sale. The result, they promise, is that companies will save time, energy and money - and will revolutionize their entire organizations in the bargain. Not content to simply study western problem-solving methods, the worldly authors guide their readers through a wide array of Japanese manufacturing wisdom as well. Their generosity and depth make this a pleasantly informative book, which defies the current trend in business books of proclaiming doom and then offering a quick fix. This book would rather proclaim hope, which is just one of the reasons that we [...] recommend it to serious managers who want to trim the fat.	2001-08-28

Gian Luigi Longinotti-Buitoni's premise is that the best way to sell products is to tap into customers' emotional impulses, which can override their rational thinking. It's a good theory, as proven by how effectively the CEO of Ferrari North America used it in writing this book. As a reader, you can't help but get swept up in the pages of description of wondrous products from the likes of Ferrari, Tiffany, the Ritz and Cohiba. And when you do, it's easy to overlook the fact that the book is slightly repetitive and presents ideas that are far from radical. However, Longinotti-Buitoni's anecdotes about the development of the Ferrari brand name, as well as those of other high-end companies, are sure to delight marketing and advertising practitioners. We [...] recommend this book to professionals in those fields, who will find useful insights, especially in the excellent summaries that come toward the end of each chapter. A clear introduction and a well-executed concluding chapter also help clarify the ideas. There is probably more passion than substance to Selling Dreams, but in the end, isn't that what it's all about?	2001-08-28

Like a coroner opening a corpse, Gordon Chang dissects the current Chinese regime. His book is an indictment of the Chinese Communist Party, part autopsy report and part emotional polemic. While the ultimate truth of Chang's predictions will emerge only after the fact, the evidence that he amasses is impressive and convincing. Most intriguing is his contention that China's accession into the World Trade Organization - heralded by many as the country's economic panacea - ultimately will expose the weaknesses of China's infrastructure and begin the process of disintegration. Although Chang strongly supports his claim that collapse is imminent, you can't help but wonder if he too quickly dismisses the ability of the Party to react to changing times. After all, the regime has already outlasted most of its Communist counterparts by a decade. Nevertheless, we [...] strongly recommend this accessible book to policymakers, anyone doing business or investing in China, and to general readers, who will quickly be captivated.	2001-08-27

You might expect a massive book about computer hacking to be tedious reading, but - surprise - this one is actually fun. You'll be impressed by the quality of the writing and the clarity with which the authors explain complicated matters. Why have these clever writers gone public with information on how to hack into computers? They figure that hackers learn how to penetrate systems anyway. It's the network administrators and other professionals that need to understand hacking to protect their own vulnerabilities. The book, which is detailed almost to a fault, explains how to defend and attack specific programs, Web sites, voicemail, firewalls and even individual Internet users. We at getAbstract.com recommend this as an essential reference for businesspeople who want to know why system administrators always look twitchy. It's also a good tool for any computer professional whose day - or career - might be ruined by a single moment of system weakness.	2001-08-27

Van de Ven and his co-authors, quite an innovative crew, have crafted a thorough academic model of the corporate innovation process. The authors use a river rafting trip analogy for the innovation journey, where uncharted, challenging territory demands leadership and cooperation. The river metaphor is good to keep in mind here, because the subject matter gets a little dry. The team found that common factors exist in every quest for innovation, and constructed a cohesive model for innovators. The material - resulting from 17 years of research at the University of Minnesota's Minnesota Innovation Research Foundation (MIRP) - is truly exhaustive, detailed and academic. Because of this, a reader with no background in innovation theory might find it somewhat arcane. We [...] recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the complex process of corporate innovation.	2001-08-24

Authors Marvin Cetron and Owen Davies examine anticipated trends in technology over the next 15 to 20 years. They categorize their studies under digital systems, the Internet, high-tech materials, nanotechnology, transportation, space, energy, medicine and environmental remediation. They examine specific technological proposals and estimate their chances for success within the next two decades. An appendix lists specific predictions and the probability that each will come to pass. The book is necessarily superficial, since it covers such a broad range of topics. Unavoidably, some predictions are already somewhat dated, particularly those about industries that undergo constant, rapid change, such as medicine, computers and the Internet. However, the book provides a thorough survey of the range of technologies that are under study and development. This book is a rich source of ideas and makes interesting connections among disparate technologies. We [...] recommend the book to all corporate planners, trend-researchers and long-term thinkers.	2001-08-24

Many corporate officers deal with risk, from treasurers and risk managers to CFOs. But since each department faces risks of a different type, risk management in many cases is an ad hoc affair. Prakash Shimpi's vision of integrated risk management not only consolidates the risk-management practices of an entire firm, but also blends capital management and risk management into a single, cohesive framework. This framework is the centerpiece of Shimpi's book, which also provides readers with a comprehensive look at current risk-management practices, old and new tools for managing risk, and likely future developments in the field. While the topic at hand is complex and built of often-unfamiliar jargon, Shimpi manages to present the material in an accessible and engaging manner that will satisfy financial experts but won't intimidate novices. We [...] recommend this book not only to the obvious audience of risk managers, treasurers and c-level executives, but also to mid-level managers and students, who will need an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the topic as risk management becomes an ever-larger component of basic corporate strategy.	2001-08-24

Bob Weinstein has built a career on advising you about yours. He is right on target in his latest book, a snappy, honest, conversational guide to job-hunting. Throw away all your old books on the subject. This one takes you right into the heart of today's marketplace, where the old employment-seeking rules (even from five or 10 years ago) no longer apply.

Linda Honold describes a system for helping everyone in your company learn to become more creative, responsive, efficient and team-oriented. She describes various techniques, including methods for developing an interest in learning and in self-knowledge, individual learning tools, mentoring, coaching and peer learning as well as strategies for helping people learn in groups. She pays particular attention to learning styles, drawing on the Myers-Briggs personality type system. This book speaks primarily to human resource professionals and to executives who might be setting up learning systems for their own companies. Others may find the book dry and overly concerned with the details of systematizing the serendipity of informal learning. But we [...] recommend this book to HR practitioners, and also to professionals delving into knowledge management, who will certainly benefit from this theoretical look at how people in companies actually learn.	2001-08-22

Managing your brands as an asset is one of those obvious management priorities that becomes less obvious under the pressure of quarterly earnings. To a great extent, however, short-term numbers depend on the long-term positioning of your brands. Take a look at your organization. Is branding relegated to a department in your marketing division? If so, chances are your brand is being managed as a marketing tool rather than a corporate asset. Because the brand is the living relationship you have with your customers, it is critical that branding be elevated as a corporate priority. This book will show you how. We [...] recommend this excellent book to top executives looking to reposition a company's brands, marketing professionals who have charge of branding strategies, and for anyone whose business relies on the power of your brands.	2001-08-22

Although the business press likes nothing more than the rise and fall of mighty corporate monarchs, authors David A. Heenan and Warren Bennis (co-leaders themselves, clearly) contend that today's most important management trend is the movement toward collaborative leadership. While it's become common wisdom that the lightening-fast pace of contemporary business demands more flexible command structures than traditional corporate hierarchies can provide, the cult of personality still dominates public perception. Heenan and Bennis present compelling theory as a basis for their co-leadership model, and reinforce their thinking with a string of examples of executive dynamic duos, like Gates/Ballmer, Grove/Barrett and Merrill/Smith. The case histories are not used to blindly buttress the authors' point, however. The bloody Eisner/Ovitz debacle at Disney is presented in gruesome detail, an apt illustration of the danger of ego in a collaborative age. We [...] recommend this book as required reading for any corporate executive.	2001-08-22

Her book lives up to its billing as the first practical guide for small business owners who want to know how to manage a crisis like the big guys, or even better. Traverso tells you how to prepare for a crisis, prevent a crisis and manage a crisis if one happens. She's written a thorough manual imbued with her understanding of the mindset and circumstances affecting small business owners. Traverso's well-written book is jam-packed with insights, valuable lists, ideas and examples, and it never skims the surface of an issue. Come wind, sleet, hail or dark of night, if you are in a small business, we [...] recommend this essential book. Even if you work for a large organization, this book might be worth your time, since many big companies are strictly small-time when it comes to planning ahead.	2001-08-22

Despite the stereotype of the great company run by a mercurial, charismatic dictator in the Steve Jobs mode, a number of cutting edge business thinkers argue that if you want your company to grow, you should introduce democracy into the management mix. One of those thinkers is author Bernard Liautaud, who, unlike most folks who theorize about business, actually owns a company, and a fairly significant one at that. His European software company, Business Objects, has annual revenues of more than $240 million. In his book, he explains why democracy is good for business. Companies that adopt his ideas, he says, will realize numerous advantages, including better communication between the company and the customer, more intelligent data about who buys products and why, and the discovery that you can sell data back to your customer. We [...] welcome this fascinating report from the horse's mouth about the growth and evolution of the democratic, intelligent, e-organization.	2001-08-21

This book collects provocative, insightful essays by Russell L. Ackoff, architect turned city planner turned behavioral scientist turned professor. True to his convictions about systems thinking, his pieces form a coherent whole. Like a successful system, the whole of this book is greater than the sum of its parts. And what parts: the roots of systems thinking; a properly irreverent approach to bureaucracy; the role of planning; a standard for mission statements; effective advertising advice. Ackoff is a voice in the wilderness as he fondly remembers his bureaucracy-bucking, folly-filled, smart-as-heck past. Although this book tends to veer toward the academic, managers and students of management will find it useful. We [...] recommend it to anyone seeking insight on creativity, education, and science.

Ken Davies has written an informed observer's account of the passionate race to solve what some believe to be the most profound scientific riddle of our era: decoding the human genome. His book is an undertaking of ambitious scope: He aims to paint the personalities in all their human colors and offer an accurate historical account, while also drilling deep enough into the research to do justice to the science. He does a beautiful job of suggesting the profound personal motivations of the two protagonists of the drama, scientists Francis Crick and maverick scientist J. Craig Venter. Short of earning your Ph.D. in molecular science, this may be as close as you ever get to understanding what the hoopla was really all about. We [...] recommend Davies' book as a must for savvy thinkers in the biotech business, and an enlightening read for the rest of us mere (genetically flawed) mortals.	2001-08-20

Terry Beck's selling wisdom is practical and based in common sense. Many of the suggestions here pertain to the most basic of all sales traits: persistence. It's refreshing to hear a sales guru say simply that it's a salesman's basic job to make the call, and he has no one but himself to blame if he doesn't. The advice here is grounded in hard work: show initiative, do your homework, know your product, cater to your customer, be yourself and don't make phony pitches. More distinctively, Beck corrects a lot of myths that actually harm your ability to make a sale. Of course, if you're a weathered sales veteran this information is not exactly breaking news. But if you're always looking to sharpen up your skills - and in this day and age you should be - we [...] recommend this well organized and conversational manual.	2001-08-16

This excellent book tracks his saga and discusses general principles and how-to tips leaders can apply to create effective change. This isn't just another leadership book. Rodin involves you in his personal story. He candidly outlines the difficulties he faced in his company when he tried to get everyone involved in his transformation mission.

Calvins book  which is as concise as an effective sales pitch  gives you a thorough blueprint for building or rebuilding your sales team. The book is filled with questionnaires and lists, including a sample performance evaluation and a rundown on what not to say to a potential hire. Calvin argues that managers often neglect training, which alone should take up 40% of their time. We [...] highly recommend this potential Bible for sales managers, which makes it clear that you must be more critical of your sales forces achievements in areas such as prospecting, closing and even personal demeanor.

Tom King presents an in-depth portrait of Hollywood powerhouse David Geffen, one of the three founders of DreamWorks SKG, the first new Hollywood studio in 55 years. King begins with Geffen's parents and childhood in Brooklyn, and shows how he developed his talent as an aggressive promoter and entrepreneur early on. King traces Geffen's rise from the mailroom at the William Morris Agency to independent entertainment agent, record label owner and, eventually, a movie-producer and deal-maker. We at getAbstract.com were intrigued with King's ability to show how Geffen's influence now extends far beyond show business into the arenas of Wall Street, art, real estate and politics. Although this is a long book, it is fascinating. King creates a breezy narrative that often moves like a novel, despite some invented dialogue. If you are an executive, manager or entrepreneur who's looking for a juicy read, you've found one.	2001-08-15

You must assess your present reality and external threats, create a plan to get to your future, and monitor the results. The book's focus on a future vision distinguishes it from ordinary problem-solving guides. Lippitt cites a few examples of groups that have used this approach successfully over the course of 30 years and emphasizes using this technique in a group session. This nicely written, well-organized book clearly and simply presents its eight-step model and offers a complete implementation guide. We [...] recommend this book as useful to anyone working on planning or managing change - from CEOs to team leaders and trainers. One caveat: Its methods seem similar to those offered in other leadership and strategic change literature. The specific steps may vary, but the basic approach is much the same.

At the peak of the dot-com bubble, buying Internet stocks was momentum investing at its most pure - get in when a new stock or sector is on its upswing, and get out while the gettin's good. But Peter S. Cohan has created new criteria for Internet investors to apply in the traditional method of fundamental analysis. Instead of looking to old-line gurus like Graham or Buffet for advice, Cohan draws on the business strategies of John D. Rockefeller to come up with fresh e-commerce attributes like economic leverage, closed-loop solutions and adaptive management for investors to measure. We [...] recommend this book to executives, employees and students with equal vigor, although consider yourself forewarned that Cohan's extended barking-dog analogy will grate on your nerves.

Conner's book operates under the assumption that the future of business will be steeped in chaos. Thus, it tries to prepare the leaders of the future for the kinds of challenges that result from chaos. These challenges will primarily involve employees, since every person reacts differently and usually unfavorably, to change. The companies that marshal an agile workforce and adapt quickly to unexpected circumstances will do the best in this unstable environment. This thoroughly researched book gives leaders a decisive look at what happens when the human psyche tries to navigate change. Conner documents the problems people have when they deal with change and offers a disciplined strategy for making your organization more limber. Even if you've heard many of the key concepts presented before, as you navigate the waters of change, this calm, lucid manual will keep your hands steady at the helm. Therefore, we [...] recommend it to everyone who is confronting change, and that is everyone.	2001-08-14

He starts with biographical details and provides a definitive account of Drucker's achievements as a management researcher, thinker, and writer. Flaherty's fascinating book highlights Drucker's contributions to the fields of management and business strategy. Of necessity, the author includes summaries of Drucker's books and quotes from his work. But, reaching a little deeper, Flaherty also shows how Drucker, who began as a social and political theorist, came to create the new academic field of management. Many of Drucker's early ideas are still applicable today, as Flaherty makes abundantly clear in this book, which we [...] strongly recommend to managers of all levels and students of business.	2001-08-14

If a chief executive unknowingly steers his or her ship into the path of a hurricane, that ship's in trouble, no matter how skillful a seaman that captain may be. And unfortunately for CEOs, hurricanes - in the form of disruptive changes that remake markets overnight - have become almost an everyday danger. Authors W. Warner Burke, William Trahant and Richard Koonce argue that the most critical function of a corporate leader today is to monitor and respond to these rapid shifts in the external marketplace, or business climate. To illustrate this point, they offer insightful profiles of leaders who successfully guided their companies through the storms of organizational change initiatives. These profiles are especially effective in giving the reader both a sense of the personalities of these dynamic executives and a practical breakdown of the methodologies and strategies that they employed. We [...] strongly recommend this book to senior executives, would-be change agents and anyone curious about how to navigate the turbulent environment of 21st-century business.	2001-08-13

Marchand, William J. Kettinger and John D. Rollins, professors and consultants on information technology and management, explain how your company can improve its business performance using information orientation (IO). The authors present ways to improve corporate capabilities in information management, information technology and employee use of information. The authors draw from interviews with about 1,000 senior managers from more than 100 companies, representing two dozen countries and two dozen industries. The book uses case histories and examples from these interviews to support its central model, which is based on building, using and measuring these three information capabilities. The authors present innovative answers to the perpetual question of how to quantify subjective measures. The one shortcoming, beyond explanatory repetition, is the problem of sorting out programs with initials instead of names. Yet, we [...] found this book quite solid, albeit academically written, and suggest it to all managers and executives involved with IT initiatives at large companies.	2001-08-08

Science is breeding new technologies at an unprecedented rate, and with the birth of each advancement comes a new generation of ethical concerns. Few developments have rattled the world's moral cage more than cloning, and it behooves any professional to have a working knowledge of the foundations of the current debates surrounding the genetic sciences. Of course, understanding how Dolly the Lamb was cloned from an adult sheep is probably beyond the grasp of most readers. But authors Ian Wilmut, Keith Campbell (the two leaders of the cloning team) and Colin Tudge  (an experienced science writer) examine every inch of scientific ground the project covered. While many details are presented densely, this clearly written, first-person account of a momentous, history-making event is fascinating, particularly for readers of a scientific bent. We [...] recommend this book to any and all readers as a basic education in a field that has the potential to impact all of our businesses and our lives. Hello, Dolly.	2001-08-07

Walker briefly introduces the new Web-based technologies that are enabling human resource (HR) managers to operate more effectively. He then offers a series of 17 articles by different authors covering these new approaches. The topics covered include Web-based employee self-service, delivering employee benefits over the Web, creating an HR service center, outsourcing and using the Web for a variety of services, including recruiting, staffing, compensation planning, employee development and knowledge management. This specialized book will primarily interest HR professionals, top executives and information technology professionals involved in setting up HR information systems. Since HR professionals are attuned to human failings, we [...] trust they will forgive the book's occasional information overlaps - hard to avoid with a collection of articles by different authors - and frequently return to this solid and specifically useful book.	2001-08-07

No one knows Six Sigma, which seeks near perfect customer satisfaction, like George Eckes, the consultant who literally wrote the book on it (The Six Sigma Revolution: How General Electric and Others Turned Process into Profits). In his second book, Eckes emphasizes the importance of molding organizational culture to generate broad acceptance of a Six Sigma initiative, using illustrative examples from his workshops. He describes ways to overcome internal resistance to change, to sell the program's benefits and to get key people as well as the masses on board. If you are launching a Six Sigma program, Eckes provides many specific suggestions of strategies you can employ. But because much of Eckes' wisdom can be applied more generally to organizational change efforts, we [...] recommend this insightful book to any executive, whether or not Six Sigma is your strategy of choice.	2001-08-07

Davis' book on training strategies, which the authors now have adapted as a personal self-help guide to learning. Although they touch briefly on underlying learning theories and present examples of learning from diverse academic fields (i.e. psychology, sociology, philosophy and communications), this is primarily a step-by-step manual. It begins with a brief self-assessment, guiding you to examine your strengths and weaknesses and to decide what you want to learn. Then, the authors explain how and when to use each of the seven major approaches to learning: behavioral, cognitive, inquiry, mental models, collaborative, virtual realities and holistic learning. They also suggest the best ways to learn in each category. Their well organized book lists major principles, enumerates rules, and provides a summary of each chapter. We [...] recommend this individually directed manual to those who wish to make the most of the time they spend absorbing new information.	2001-08-07

O.K., we all know it's a gimmick, but it's such a good gimmick that you can't help but be won over. John O. Whitney and Tina Packer extract timeless truths about human nature from the works of Shakespeare and apply them to today's business world. Theme by theme, the authors tackle power, communication, trust, decision, action, hierarchy and women in management. Linking business dramas and dilemmas faced by today's companies and corporate leaders to those faced by Shakespeare's characters, the authors serve up a treasure trove of valuable insight and guidance in this immensely satisfying book. We [...] recommend this book to anyone in business or outside of it. Because like the works of Shakespeare himself, this book, while aimed at a specific audience, aspires to, and in many cases reaches, more universal truths.	2001-08-06

John Thorp's book recalls Mark Twain's definition of a classic as \\"a book you want to have read but don't want to read.\\" If you're an executive with control over your company's information technology purse stings, you probably don't want to read a book this detailed in the intricacies of IT, which is exactly the reason that you should. Thorp's initial premise is that many IT investments never pan out in part because the people that are signing off on them have absolutely no idea what to expect. This book will give you a clue, but don't expect to enjoy it. It's dense with IT terminology, change and program management strategies and valuation techniques. We [...] recommend this book to all of you professionals who know that you need a better understanding of information technology, even if you won't admit it. Don't put off reading this book, no matter how much you'd like to.	2001-08-06

Organizations are adaptive structures that respond creatively to changing circumstances. This responsive evolution takes place on an official, surface level, and also on a deeper, personal level composed of interactions between people. So says Ralph D. Stacey, who combines insights from psychoanalysis, behavioral research, the new science of complexity and other disciplines to suggest ways for your organization to become better at learning and adapting. While the basic concepts of complexity theory presented in this book are steadily gaining popularity, the actual complexity of the book's content might make it difficult for non-experts to follow. Although the book's tight organization keeps chaos at bay, some of the language might leave you at \\"the edge of disintegration.\\" Nevertheless, we at  [...] strongly recommend this book to executives and managers looking to build a theoretical foundation for their organizational approach, in addition to the many academics who will appreciate its systematic explanation of the organizational consequences of systems thinking.	2001-08-03

Don Middleberg adapts key public relations strategies to the new media landscape, transformed by the Internet and wireless communications. He emphasizes the need for response speed and short-term - as well as long-term - planning, since this new environment changes so quickly as to render the future unpredictable. He outlines techniques for getting buzz, which is now a critical element in effective branding. However, this book cannot help but be affected by the dot-com downfall: Many of its examples refer to now defunct companies, or to those who are in deep trouble (and may well be deceased by the time you read this review). Still, if you overlook the problems that come from writing during the Internet reality-warp, we [...] recommend this executive guide for its solid PR strategies, which although geared for a high-tech world, are firmly rooted in traditional method.	2001-08-03

Author Rick Freedman spent many years as a consultant and his textbook and accompanying CD offer a lot of orderly advice aimed at both the novice consultant and the veteran consultant who wants to improve. Freedman covers such topics as the business of advice, the IT (information technology) consulting framework and developing superior consulting skills. Freedman's main argument is that consultants should train so that they can be of more help to their clients. Successful consultants, he maintains, rely more on their people skills than on their technical gifts. Freedman also gives aspiring consultants advice on how to remain competitive in securing and keeping clients. He instructs consultants to read a steady stream of periodicals and books to keep up with the vast daily changes in technology. We [...] suggest that you can use his book and CD set to find out everything you ever wanted to know about consulting - including how hard it is - but never knew who to ask.	2001-08-03

He includes ample examples of what Microsoft does right and what most other corporations do wrong. You will learn why Microsoft's focus makes it the hardest company in the world to compete against. Yet, you will also find nuggets of management information that can be applied to your own workplace environment. Thielen has written a direct, refreshing, and sometimes brutal book.

Poirier, who took a topic that almost cries out for unintelligible jargon and undecipherable graphs, and instead laid it plain, in common English, for all to understand. His essential notion: To achieve efficiencies you must develop a closer working relationship with the vendors that make up your supply chain. The goal is to share real-time inventory and production data so that your network of business partners - Poirier's supply-chain constellation - is better able to meet the end needs of the consumer. The major shortcoming of the book lies in its omission of information-based companies from its analysis. How can knowledge industry firms integrate their less tangible supply chains, and will they reap the same rewards as widget-makers if they do? Regardless, we [...] strongly recommend this book to anyone not an expert in the latest logistics-management techniques - and, unfortunately, that's almost everyone.	2001-08-02

Author Jonathan Bick gives general readers a short introduction to the ways that various laws apply to the Internet. He focuses on existing laws about contracts, defamation, privacy, copyright, trademark and other areas, and explains their application to the Internet environment, since few laws specific to the Internet have been drafted. He covers a variety of topics, including Internet-related taxes, rights, options, obligations, liabilities, debt collection, advertising, billing refunds, intellectual property protections and more, all organized into one- or two-page discussions. Each section is followed by a summary of the law or recommendations on how it applies to business. We [...] recommend this clear and easy-to-understand guide to anyone who uses the Internet for work, business or entertainment. And if you hit a section that doesn't apply to you, skip ahead - one advantage of the book's organization is that you can jump to the sections that interest you.	2001-08-02

This collection of essays links futurist Stan Davis' previous works with some of his newer ideas about change and commerce. Believing that his ideas (Future Wealth, Blur, Future Perfect, 2020 Vision) have held up, he expands upon them to explain the philosophy he thinks underlies the next 20 years (or \\"the second half\\") of the information revolution. He delves into the next era he anticipates, one of even greater consequence - the Bio Economy. He explains not only the rise of biotech, but also the biological or networked economy, where everything is connected to everyone all the time. Moving from theoretical to practical, he advises judging your company's worth by its predicted rate of growth and change, not by traditional measurements. Then, Davis speculates about the more distant future, post 2050, when cloning, stem-cell research and such transcend theory and join the chaos of our everyday lives.

Old-economy companies weren't supposed to survive the dot-com era, but some of the \\"dinosaurs\\" adapted and they're doing quite well, thank you. Accomplished business author David Stauffer profiles 20 old-economy companies that excel at e-business. The usual-suspect behemoths, such as Ford and Bertelsmann, are here, but he also profiles a six-man automobile transmission shop in Arizona, seed stock ranchers in Montana and other less-than-obvious candidates. Stauffer says that every company's path toward e-commerce is unique, but that path is nonetheless generally approved and determined by management. Thus, change is hard to manage without CEO support, even if the CEO dates back to dinosaur days. So if you run a traditional company - with actual assets - and you want to make that difficult evolutionary stride toward e-commerce, we at getAbstract.com suggest that you might find concise instruction here.	2001-07-30

Michael Robert presents a well-organized plan to enable you to produce a distinctive strategy. He emphasizes the need for strategic thinking, which sets out a vision of where your company is going. Use this as your basis for making the appropriate choices and plans. Clarify what your company is, and is not, to avoid becoming scattered and overextended. Robert uses the metaphor of playing a game as his framework. Every CEO must carefully choose what game to play, and how to craft a strategy to make and shape the rules. To illustrate these principles, Robert draws on actual examples from client companies, alternating a step-by-step guide to strategic planning with brief case studies that demonstrate strategic thinking.

Stan Hinden provides answers (or shows you where to get the answers) to the major questions you face upon retirement in the United States: Are you ready to retire? Can you afford to? What will Social Security and pensions provide? How do you deal with company savings plans and IRAs? How should you invest? What do you do about health insurance or preparing for serious illness? How do you decide where to live? Hinden warms his factual text with slightly saccharine stories about how he and his wife prepared for retirement, so you might have to be in the mood. His generally simple, clearly written book is directed toward a general audience, so some of the advice about financial planning, Social Security and pensions may be targeted more to mid-level managers or employees. We [...] caution that those with lofty incomes may need loftier advice, but otherwise this is a solid introduction to retirement. (And we didnt really mind the syrupy stories.)	2001-07-27

They emphasize matching investors with the right entrepreneurs to create an effective team in which the investor not only provides the seed or early-stage capital but also contributes good advice and contacts. Besides discussing effective strategies, the book includes an extensive directory of top venture forums, angel organizations, publications and Web sites. In addition, any investor will benefit from the thorough rundown of due-diligence points that the authors recommend. While the book is targeted at prospective investors, we [...] encourage entrepreneurs with start-up companies to use it as a productive guide to making more effective funding pitches, although the companion book for entrepreneurs would probably be more helpful. One caveat: Some ideas are repeated - even with similar wording - from chapter to chapter.

The results are in: All of those stereotypes that we've been told to forget are, in fact, true. At least, that's what a survey of 30,000 people from 31 nations suggests. The data paints some familiar pictures: the inflexible German, the vacillating Frenchman and the pushy American. The statistics from the survey support the conclusions reached by authors Fons Trompenaars and Charles Hampden-Turner in the earlier, first edition of this book: Don't base business decisions on the rhetoric that people are the same regardless of race, color or creed. They aren't! Academically organized, dense with anecdotes and, this time, thoroughly documented, Riding the Waves of Culture is entertaining at least, and possibly essential in this global age.

If your notions of how to get along with your boss stopped at the admiring-the-family-photos-on-the-credenza stage, here's how to move it along. Michael Dobson and Deborah Singer Dobson advance kissing-up to a new, practical level, as they straightforwardly explain their boss-wrangling concepts. You can read the brief chapters in bite-size chunks and each one ends with a worksheet. While these concepts about understanding your boss and playing to the boss's priorities are not particularly innovative, they are useful and accessible. The Dobsons wrote their book as much for the folks in the cubicles as for the fellow in the office with his feet on the desk. Reading this book won't change your boss's personality - but it might blunt his pitchfork.

With his tour through the inner-workings of design firm and idea-factory IDEO, Tom Kelley achieves the nearly impossible: He presents creative and innovative observations about creativity and innovation. We'll put it simply: Toss aside all the books about the topics that you've ever bought, and tear into this beautifully constructed showpiece. Kelley distills the often amorphous concepts of brainstorming and teamwork into directives with honest-to-goodness real-life applications. His notions about prototyping are fresh, insightful and practical. His bigger-picture ruminations illustrate not only how organizations should work at innovation, but also how easily creative initiative can be smashed by dumb bureaucracy. If the book has one failing it is this: Reading it can be a bit like watching a home movie of a friend's children - Your role is clearly to join in the adulation. That aside, we [...] recommend The Art of Innovation as one of the few can't-miss books in the creativity genre.	2001-07-20

The convergence of genetics and materials science is about to change everything fast. Author Richard Oliver describes himself as a disciple of the brilliant Canadian futurist Marshall McLuhan, so you can expect a book rife with sweeping predictions and neologisms. Parental advisory: In this book, buzzwords proliferate like that lab experiment you started in high school and just couldn't stop. To cut to the \\"bio\\" bottom line: The world as you know it will basically cease to exist in about five years. (Oh, that's no surprise, but how can you make a buck off of it, right?) Well, give Oliver credit: He backs up his bio-ideas with solid bio-research, and you get the uncanny feeling that his bio-predictions are probably accurate, in spite of the annoying prefixes. After all, it wasn't too long ago that a certain don north of the border was ridiculed for his zany description of an impending \\"Global Village.\\" We [...] recommend this book for anyone who could benefit from a user's manual on the future. Indeed, you could say it's a veritable bio-crystal ball.	2001-07-20

Fred Crawford and Ryan Mathews base their business strategy on a dim view of modern society: We are consumers, adrift in a valueless society, looking to economic transactions to support our beliefs. Operating under this depressing but insightful premise, Crawford and Ryan maintain that most companies don&#8217;t really understand their customers at all; rather, they simply purport to be the best at everything they do. The authors suggest a different course: Dominate one area of a transaction that reflects and reinforces the values of the consumers that you would like for customers. (If this concept seems too abstract, just head down to your local Starbucks and take a good look around.) Grounded in exhaustive research, this book builds upon traditional business wisdom &#8212; specialize, and don&#8217;t try to be all things to all people &#8212; to create a seminal business philosophy for modern-day markets.

The first is a carefully constructed narrative about a fired executive that she uses to describe her approach to rebuilding a shattered life. The man feels a loss of identity when he is laid off, fears the reaction of his wife and becomes intensely depressed before finally consulting a psychologist. The psychologist, unfortunately, introduces Berman's second device: the Emotional House. The upshot: After getting fired, you need to rebuild your damaged Emotional House, which is constructed with the 7 C's of courage, confidence, choice, communication ... you get the picture. The metaphor quickly becomes annoying, since the points that it's used to illustrate are self-evident. Much more valuable are the self-quizzes that follow each chapter, which will certainly provide some much appreciated guidance to the recently downsized. It is primarily to this group that we[...] recommend Berman's book, although these days, it might not be a bad idea for everyone to keep a copy stashed away - just in case.	2001-07-16

The more information a market provides the more efficiently it will operate, right? Well, in theory that&#8217;s so. In fact, market transparency has been a top goal of financial regulators in the U.S. for decades. But is it possible to have too much information? Richard Bernstein makes a compelling argument that not all information is good information. Noise &#8212; the deluge of 24-hour news coverage, constant cable TV market-chatter, continuous Internet feeds and barrages of electronic updates &#8212; is a danger to most investors, who lack the resources to separate the accurate from the spurious. This book is a Godsend for investors who think &#8212; usually mistakenly &#8212; they can make sense of it all. Bernstein tells you how to cut through the noise by focusing on long-term investment plans, diversifying and clearly assessing risk. We [...] recommend this informative book for its crisp, personal style, and for its practical approach to bringing some peace and quiet to your portfolio.	2001-07-10

One of this book's mantras is that purchasing is a lot more important these days than in decades past. The authors, Dave Nelson, Patricia Moody and Jonathon Stegner, have spent decades in the field of purchasing. Their principal argument is that now that most companies outsource their equipment and even their parts (for example, very few Dell parts are made in-house), purchasing has become not only more important, but a potential source of incredible savings. The dozen companies profiled in this book - which is meant to detail the best practices in purchasing worldwide - have realized millions of dollars in savings simply by optimizing supply-chain management. The authors emphasize that this isn't an individual task. Change in purchasing management requires an internal team and management support. We [...] recommend this book not only to purchasing managers, but to all corporate executives, any of whom will glean some invaluable pointers about how to save money in day-to-day operations.	2001-07-10

Globalization can create as many problems as opportunities. One big problem is figuring out how to unite people worldwide to work on projects for your company. In an age that lacked a worldwide communications net, the answer would probably be quite depressing. However, as authors Jessica Lipnack and Jeffrey Stamps make clear, the modern Internet makes it quite possible for workers all over the world to collaborate. The physical location of your firm&#8217;s various experts is no longer a barrier to effective team building, be they in Dublin, Bangalore, Las Vegas or Bangkok. In fact, the authors claim that companies that fail to create effective teams across cyberspace will be left in history&#8217;s dustbin. This might be overstating the case, but we [...] recommend this book for its candor about exactly how challenging it is to create virtual teams. Still interested? If so, this book serves as an excellent primer of both theory and practice.	2001-07-10

Books	5	2	2	N	N	Highly Recommended!	Tom Peters takes this book's role in the \\"Reinventing Work Series\\" seriously. He urges corporate departments, such as human resources and accounting, to reinvent themselves as professional service firms, thinking of their work as projects and of their companies as clients. He believes this will result in a more energized workforce and higher-quality work. His approach is marked by his now signature \\"gee whiz\\" writing style, which is punctuated by large typefaces, exclamation points and remarks like \\"Amen!\\" and \\"WOW!\\" We [...] recommend this book for its innovative points and no \\"b.s.\\" attitude, but Peters-bashers will groan at the repetition of ideas and cheerleading expressions. This is a useful, inspiring pep talk, and if it is not exactly In Search of Excellence - which seemed to be written for adults who didn't need quite so much hip-hip hoopla - that was then and this is now.	2001-07-09

Yes, this is the renowned marketing classic, revered for bringing to light the now ubiquitous strategy of positioning. If you're in business, you probably have at least a fuzzy notion of what the term means. If you're in marketing, you probably hear the word used at least five times a day. (Seriously, try counting.) But in terms of defining positioning and explaining how to use it as a foundation for your strategy, nobody has done a better job than Al Ries and Jack Trout in this original. Of course, the book does have a slightly historical flavor to it now, since the most contemporary business examples cited arrive from the 1970s and 1980s. While a lot has changed since then, a lot hasn't. You'll be surprised how similar this book sounds to the marketing missives of 2001, despite the fact that it was written before the arrival of the Internet, globalization and other buzzwords du jour. We [...] recommend that any executive charged with product development or general business strategy join those in marketing, advertising and sales by taking a few hours to read this book, and get back to the basics.	2001-07-06

Since it now appears that the laws of economics do indeed still apply to the U.S. stock market, it seems a good time to brush up on the history of Wall Street. Such a look back is especially important to the millions of investment bankers, brokers and individual investors who cut their teeth in the \\"irrational exuberance\\" of the `90s and are now catching their first real glimpse of the bear. B. Mark Smith's comprehensive history of the U.S. equity market demonstrates, if nothing else, that this ain't the first time a bubble's burst and it sure won't be the last. The beauty of Smith's book derives from his ability to link the development of the market with the history of the times. He begins with the founding of the first exchange in the late 1700s and traces the market's increasingly powerful role through the last century, when it helped fuel modern technological and economic growth. The book is especially intriguing when it discusses the relatively unknown early years of the market, before its big crash in 1929. We [...] recommend this fascinating history to executives, financiers and academics, as well as to a broad audience of history buffs, even those with little knowledge about stocks.	2001-07-06

Continual improvement is the key to survival in today's business climate, and as companies like GE and Motorola have proven, Six Sigma is a useful tool for ingraining the quest for perfection in an organization. After reading The Six Sigma Way, you'll probably be ready to jump out of your chair and immediately follow in these companies' footsteps by launching a Six Sigma initiative of your own. The authors, three consultants who teach firms to implement Six Sigma efforts, convincingly extol the money-saving and efficiency-enhancing virtues of the holistic approach. This book offers a lot of jargon and complex concepts, but the material is presented in easily understood charts and lists, and there are plenty of concrete examples. We [...] recommend The Six Sigma Way to managers who have heard wondrous tales of Six Sigma, but would like a more down-to-earth explanation of how it can be used and the benefits it offers.	2001-07-03

Ginny Pearson Barnes&#8217; book declares that negotiations should not be wars of attrition or clashes of egos. Instead, they should be mutually beneficial dialogues that involve an open exchange of ideas, mutual respect and a celebration of differences. Sound a little simplistic? Perhaps. But the book is crisply written and covers all the points that one would expect: determining which side of a negotiation holds the power, using body language to your advantage and crafting fall-back positions. While some of Barnes&#8217; advice, like finding satisfaction in defeat, will sound a bit trite to hardened negotiators, she does present some interesting bargaining-table techniques, including some innovative ways to derail a domineering opponent. Nevertheless, veterans of hard-fought deliberations likely will find Successful Negotiating a bit soft in detail, so we [ ...] recommend the book to rookie negotiators who want to know what to expect when they step into the smoke-filled room.	2001-07-03

Charles E. Watson, Ph.D., describes a variety of problems that can occur at work and tells you how &#8220;smart people&#8221; deal with them effectively. By smart, he means &#8220;good,&#8221; his point being that good is smart. He organizes his management-oriented scenarios according to a series of themes that highlight the best policies to adopt, such as sticking to your principles, accurately weighing your options and seeking to do what&#8217;s right, not what&#8217;s popular. The book mixes behavioral tips with solutions to problems, emphasizing the need to be trustworthy and responsible and to follow the path of morality and integrity. Sometimes the book seems scattered, since the author distances the solutions from the dilemmas by dropping tips in between them, but the point and purpose survive this wrinkle. Since we at [web address]&#8212; like most of you &#8212; find it pretty easy to advocate goodness, truth and fair dealing, we liked Watson&#8217;s approach.

Hooke is realistic about the great risks - such as unstable governments in impoverished countries - but he highlights future potential. His book is a solidly researched and clearly written guide to assessing the business climate and deciding what types of products make the most sense in different developing countries. After an overview of the nature of emerging markets, why companies want to participate in or avoid these markets, and how to invest and make loans there, he looks at particular markets in Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa.

Sara Miles unfolds a political saga as if it were a gripping novel. The story begins with political activist Wade Randlett, who forged a coalition of Silicon Valley&#8217;s leading tech CEOs and venture capitalists to support the New Democrats. Miles starts with Randlett&#8217;s arrival in the Valley. She shows how, in 1996, Randlett lined up Bill Clinton&#8217;s opposition to Proposition 211 (allowing uncapped suits against high-tech companies), helping to swing many apolitical or Republican tech leaders to the New Democrats. Miles traces the Valley&#8217;s growing relationship with Clinton, Gore and other New Dems, which held up until the rise of George W. Bush. Miles&#8217; fascinating story may seem like ancient history (though it&#8217;s only 1996 to 2000) now that the dot-com storms have diluted the New Economy&#8217;s power. Otherwise, we at ... strongly recommend this intriguing look at a particular patch of political history, when the New Economy was strong, and everybody wanted to be a friend of the Valley.	2001-06-27

Mary Farrell, an investment strategist at PaineWebber, advises investors to put their money in large cap stocks, because they will beat small caps. Why? Large firms have spent heavily to reap the productivity rewards from technological advances. And large caps' earnings and sales will continue to outpace small caps, in part because of big companies' exposure to international markets. Low inflation and interest rates also boost large caps. Aside from this advice, Farrell's investment guidebook offers few specific suggestions. Rather, she writes, investors must determine their own goals and risk tolerance. Farrell gives easy-to-follow explanations of stocks, mutual funds, and bonds, along with an outline of estate planning. In spite of its title, this book is too rudimentary for expert investors. Still, because it contains useful information, we at  [...] recommend it to personal investors who are trying to make sense of Wall Street.

With this caveat, we [...] recommend the book primarily to those with a technological bent, such as professionals in operations and computer sciences, and academics in the field.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to uncover hidden agendas and use them to your advantage. Ronna Lichtenberg knowingly decodes office politics as usual. Her book addresses time management, starting a new job and ending an old one, gossip, and business travel. The book is easy to read and inexpensive. If there were such a thing as a \\"beach business book,\\" this would certainly classify. However, clever though it is, it doesn't cover any new territory.

In a bureaucracy, it's taken for granted that any risk - like any flesh-eating bacteria - is a bad thing. But in a fast-paced environment in which decisions must be made in rapid-fire, risk is not only a constant, it's a primary ingredient to success. So too in your daily life, in which each decision - Do I drive to work or take the train? Do I have a cigarette or use the patch? - ultimately comes down to a weighing of risks versus potential rewards. Dan Borge takes the sophisticated risk-management theories employed by some of the world's smartest companies and boils them down to easy-to-grasp principles that can be used by any business or individual. Some books must be read carefully in order to be appreciated, and this is certainly one of them. Risk management is complex, and despite Borge's skill at getting to the heart of the matter, you'll find yourself mulling over the intricacies of each page of this finely wrought book.

This technology has spawned \\"the event-driven revolution,\\" a transforming shift in how corporations act. The book begins with the early transformation of the financial services industry to an event-driven business. It goes on to discuss enterprise business applications, and then the Internet. Throughout, the author addresses the differences between contemporary and event-driven business models, with great emphasis on the event-driven model. This book is densely written, yet surprisingly easy to read.

While many management gurus espouse the growing importance of partnerships and alliances to modern business, advice on how to actually implement and manage these relationships is much harder to find.

Such seat-of-the pants planning is typical among entrepreneurs, says author Amar Bhide. Successful entrepreneurs don't need unique ideas and long resumes, Bhide writes. Rather, they must be able to adapt quickly to changing business conditions, and they must enter industries in a state of upheaval, where established players are lacking.

Hagstrom discusses Warren Buffett's secrets, covering how he became the most successful investor in the world and, as a result, one of the world's wealthiest men. Hagstrom begins by describing Buffett's early influences, from Benjamin Graham, the first professional financial analyst, to Philip Fisher, a professor and investment counselor. The key to Buffett's success is that he held onto his core principles for making investment decisions, based on four key steps: Turn off the stock market; don't worry about the economy; buy a business, not a stock; and manage a portfolio of businesses. The book is an excellent summary of the major principles and practices that led to Buffett's success. However, the extensive amount of financial analysis provides a lot of information about each of Buffett's investments. This can seem like too much detail if you just want an understanding of his basic investment principles.

Megatrends author John Naisbitt's new book (co-written by daughter Nana Naisbitt and artist Douglas Philips) is a fat book of ideas that touches upon genetics, art, media violence, time sensibilities and even South Park. Unlike most futurists, the authors make judgment calls about future timelines and inclinations. However, they agree with other futurists that full immersion virtual reality is coming, although they add that it's probably not a good thing, especially for your kids. Their compelling discussion of the genetic revolution is wide-ranging and fair-handed. Their interesting take on media violence and video games seems more controversial, evidencing a distaste that echoes the genre's most hostile opponents.

If you like your business books short, sweet and free of jargon and equations, this is the manual for you. Educator and corporate business advisor Ram Charan explains core business fundamentals in clear, concise - though not very sophisticated - language. The book's style and tone resemble that of to-the-point business writer Og Mandino. Charan begins with the metaphor of his childhood in his family's shoe shop in India, noting, \\"My experience growing up is typical of how children learn about business.\\" His family store was just one door away from a competitor's shop, so the business was \\"hand-to-hand combat.\\" From his humble roots, Charan explains the essentials of business that he believes all CEOs should know. Charan, an advisor to major corporations, fills his books with intriguing anecdotes and insights. We [...] recommend this book to those who want to understand business better, but it's not an onerous recommendation - you can finish Charan's book in a single Sunday afternoon.	2001-06-18

Barrenechea, a senior vice president for applications development at Oracle Corp., describes how to transform a company by using a range of e-business applications. He draws on Oracle's success at changing its business by using the Internet and networking to interconnect employees, customers and suppliers. Barrenechea's useful roadmap shows how your company can apply these methods to coordinate, systematize and streamline operations. He demonstrates how other companies - including General Motors, Boeing and Microsoft - use e-business networking. He writes in a straightforward style without jargon and maintains a keen focus on operations, making this book a wealth of practical knowledge. Of course, that same focus might limit the book's appeal to executives without an interest in operations technology and to other mainstream readers. We at getAbstract.com strongly recommend this educational book, and if the advice seems a little weighted toward Oracle products... well, let's not be naïve.	2001-06-18

Dr. Steven Berglas, a clinical psychologist, has written a truly engaging book examining the reasons that very successful people get burned out. Berglas combines psychological theory, social trend analysis and case stories from his own practice to illustrate the causes and symptoms of burnout, as well as some potential remedies.

Of interest to many professionals will be the special attention the book pays to the problems of baby boomers, who are especially prone to burnout because they tend toward self-centeredness (or so says the good doctor.)

D'Alessandro, the CEO of John Hancock Financial Services, describes how to build and protect a brand name. With writing assistance from Michele Owens, he draws on stories from John Hancock and other companies to illustrate successful brand building as well as missteps along the way. Based on these stories, D'Alessandro summarizes the principles of brand building, such as being consistent, refreshing the brand to keep up with the times and sponsoring events that are in keeping with the brand's image. His basic principles are familiar: Use your brand as a powerful image that reflects your company and product's core identity. We [...] like D'Alessandro's breezy, personal style and conversational approach, which convey these ideas in a fresh way. If you haven't brushed up on your branding lately, this is a useful roundup of information, reminders and cautionary tales.	2001-06-14

Laurie Beth Jones' survey of the basic principles of creating mission statements and vision statements is accompanied by her personal observations. She includes stories about clients, business associates and friends, and stories from the Bible. The book focuses on ways each individual can develop a personal path to guide him or her through professional and personal life. The book is written in short, easy-to-read sections. The basic message about missions and goals is familiar. Many readers will find that this book offers a quick and useful guide to creating an overall plan, within an inspirational and spiritual context. However, some may admire her strong Christian orientation and others may find themselves uncomfortable with it. As she notes, her personal mission is to \\"recognize, promote and inspire the divine connection in myself and others.\\" She fulfills that mission with the book's underlying Christian message.

Mark Levy's short, snappy guide teaches you private writing, which opens the door to expressing, exploring and playing with your thoughts freely - without showing them to anyone else. This ongoing exercise is valuable for sparking creativity, imagination and problem solving. Levy's ideas are presented directly and humorously, with plenty of examples. The author has an extensive background in publishing, particularly sales, which comes through in his style - part sales team rally, part lingo-ridden pep talk. This approach, however, works. We [...] recommend this book to anyone who would like to explore idea-generating methods, or to apply some structure and purpose to all those notes you've been writing to yourself.	2001-06-12

You live in a landscape littered with deflated stock indexes and failed dot-com ad campaigns, so perhaps you are prone to think that this Internet deal is a fad, like the hula-hoop. According to author Geoff Webb, if you think the Internet will fade away, you are very wrong. The true Internet explosion hasn't happened yet, but it will. Once it does, business will become so competitive that companies that haven't adapted to the new multi-channel reality - in which customers will expect a vast array of new ordering and delivery services at no extra cost - will fade away. Speed is of the essence. Older companies must form partnerships to get their competencies up to a competitive level. If hierarchies, dead weight and slow adapters obstruct radical change, you must discard them. We [...] hear the essential message: a Darwinian \\"adapt or die.\\" Adapt to the new multi-channel reality or whither away. If you want to see the future, look here.	2001-06-12

Hans has written a thorough, carefully designed study of jury behavior in civil trials. While presenting information cautiously and academically, she thoroughly explodes several common myths about civil juries and makes a powerful (if understated) case for the preservation of the civil jury system. She begins with surveys and quotes, preferring to let her data speak for itself, until she draws final conclusions and points out areas for further scholarship. Hans does not over-generalize, but the book is often repetitive, in part because some of the studies and issues overlap. Even so, the information is trimmed to a manageable length. This is not an entertaining read, but we [...] find the information and interviews clear, useful and accessible. This is a particularly helpful book for law students and professors, litigators, reporters covering the courts, corporate legal departments and anyone involved in civil litigation, especially if you have a voice in selecting a jury.	2001-06-12

Why do some nations thrive while others seem trapped in a cycle of poverty, instability and corruption? The 14 contributors to this anthology agree on one answer to this question: the rule of law. While the developed West spends billions of dollars promoting democracy in developing nations, the authors suggest that democracy in and of itself does not bring about prosperity. In terms of economic growth, stability and predictability are more important than democracy, they argue. As evidence, they contrast wealthy authoritarian regimes like Singapore with poor and corrupt democracies like India. Some readers might find the implications of such conclusions alarming. That's all the more reason to read this book, which we [...] recommend to anyone with an interest in economic development, public policy and the global political order.	2001-06-12

Andrew Kilpatrick has written a most unusual biography of one of the world's richest men, investor Warren Buffett. Instead of the dry chronology presented in most biographies, Kilpatrick has stuffed his 890 pages with 157 immensely readable, personal and professional vignettes. They are arranged in no particular order, yet they add up to a detailed and satisfying journey. Filled with plenty of inside detail from numerous original and published sources, the book lets you pull up a comfy chair inside Warren Buffett's brain.

Author Tom DeMarco presents a compelling case against total efficiency, which - he explains convincingly - can actually slow down work processes, undermine office morale and corrupt positive change. Leave some slack in your system, he says, so people have a chance to do their best and grow, which will result in a more effective organization. He includes some simple flow charts to help illustrate these ideas, along with examples of management methods that work and some that don't. We [...] particularly like his details about managing knowledge workers. The book is divided into almost three dozen short, to-the-point chapters. Each one highlights a different problem caused by lack of slack time, and suggests a solution. This pleasant read will intrigue both executives and managers. If you don't have time to read it, maybe you're being too efficient.	2001-06-11

Bernstein's history of gold is about much more than just the lure of precious metal - it's about man's relationship with wealth, his desire for prosperity and his lust for power. The story he tells presents an unflattering portrait of the human character. The book demonstrates how thirst for gold's twin uses - adornment and currency - has driven humankind to countless atrocities. This volume is so elegantly written that it deserves its own gold-leaf pages. Bernstein traces the transformation of gold into money, beginning at the dawn of historic time and ending by asking if gold will ever again recover its status as the standard for establishing the value of money. We [...] highly recommend this fine book for anyone fascinated by all that glitters, and for students of economic history as well.	2001-06-11

Kunreuther present a series of articles about making decisions written by professors at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. The articles describe how decisions are made using an ideal scenario, and then offer practical suggestions on how to make better business decisions. The book is designed to help top executives and managers use the latest methods of analysis and reasoning in decision making. Some may find this approach overly academic - in that many of the research findings are based on social laboratory experiments, statistical analysis and modeling - but if you've been making decisions based on guts, glory and a coin toss, the latest scholarship does offer some stronger strategies. We [...] found several in this solid book that will be of great help to managers dealing with employees, executives formulating strategy and finance or compliance officers weighing corporate risks.	2001-06-11

Howard Rothman, a writer who specializes in technology and management, profiles the 50 companies that had the strongest impact on the development of modern business. He sought input from high-tech executives, teachers, public relations professionals, engineers, business writers, shopkeepers, salespeople and managers in selecting the top 50, which he ranks in the order of their influence. While many of the stories in these four-page portraits are familiar, the book presents helpful historical profiles of how each company developed and influenced the business world and society. While some readers may like tackling all these capsule bios as a collection, many may prefer to regard the book more as an encyclopedia or directory and draw on the corporate information as needed. We [...] appreciate the solid work here, although the result may be more interesting as a reference book than as a cover-to-cover page-turner.	2001-06-11

Have you ever looked at an advertisement and wondered what product was being sold? If so, you're not alone. Writers Jack Trout and Steve Rivkin thought the same thing and concluded, after 30 years in the marketing and advertising business, that the creative trend in ads has gone way too far. They believe modern companies should follow the advice of legendary ad man Rosser Reeves, and focus on their \\"Unique Selling Proposition.\\" The authors caution that your company can survive in today's hyper-competitive environment only by accentuating its advantageous difference. Companies that don't promote their differences are in danger of being lost within a suffocating realm of choices. But proceed warily; focusing on the wrong difference could cost your business its business.

Author Jeanie Daniel Duck presents an engaging, personal look at the human emotions, conflicts, fears and anxieties that unite to make change difficult. She describes the five stages of the change process - stagnation, preparation, implementation, determination and, finally, fruition. As she goes in depth about each stage, the author illustrates her explanation with personal examples from her experiences as an organizational consultant. Some of the issues she raises may be familiar to those who have read other books about how to launch change initiatives, but we [...] find that her focus on the human elements of change provides a fresh perspective. The book is directed primarily toward executives, managers or supervisors in charge of leading corporate change, but even if you are already prepared to conquer the change monster, this author's personal touches and stage-by-stage approach will intrigue you.	2001-06-11

Books	5	3	3	N	N	Packed With Knowledge	Tom Peters explains how to develop \\"Wow!\\" projects - projects that are significant, revolutionary, exciting and dramatic. He claims that all companies are going in the direction of using projects as their fundamental work unit. The key to success is knowing how to create, sell and implement your projects and then how to exit to your next project. The book is devoted to these four steps. Peters offers 50 key tips on how to develop and launch these projects. This idea-packed, easy-to-read book is written in breezy, short, to-the-point sentences. Peters often uses the &quot;!&quot;, which he has adopted as his symbol. His jazzy style underlines his message: Throw aside traditional thinking and accept the new.

Instead of presenting you with a laundry list of steps designed to increase your productivity, Edwin A. Locke delves into the psyches and motives of entrepreneurs who actually managed to change their world with their productivity: Bill Gates, Sam Walton, Thomas Edison and others. His rationale? Locke convincingly concludes that highly successful executives possess a number of similar characteristics. In The Prime Movers, he tries to identify these traits and illustrate them using biographical detail. The final result is an intriguing profile that probably will entertain more than inform. (Is it any surprise that entrepreneurs are self-confident?) One note: In order to love this book you&#8217;ll have to at least like Ayn Rand, whose quotes saturate its pages &#8212; an inclusion that should give you some idea of what to expect from Locke. ...	2001-06-01

Based on a series of lectures delivered at the New York Public Library in the late 1990s, the book rambles through a variegated terrain of technology, history, ethics, philosophy and family pride. It is about thinking more than it is about ideas, about wondering more than it is about thinking.  Jules Verne and H.G.

Author Alec MacKenzie has updated the mother of all time-management books, which fist hit the shelves in 1972. Despite the fact that time management has become a multi-million-dollar industry since this title was originally published, The Time Trap still stands as one of the most effective guides to getting it together. Why? Because MacKenzie tells you flat out what the problem is: You. He doesn't offer sympathy, create excuses or complain about how modern technology has put us on a treadmill. Instead he tells you, in plain English, how to record how you spend your time, how to identify time-wasting activities, and how to change your behavior to make yourself more productive and efficient.

Trends 2000 identifies investment opportunities that will help you profit in a future of global radiation poisoning, free, unlimited energy and \\"techno-tribes\\" of pioneers who have fled cities in search of safety and clean water. These predictions and many more are made so confidently by author Gerald Calente that he frequently writes of future events - like the creation of contained cold fusion - in the past tense. The book includes headlines and stories from the Associated Press and newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and USA Today to back up its bold prognostications. While shaded by his own political leanings, Calente does point out some disturbing trends, like the steady decay of the Russian nuclear power infrastructure. He also cites some trends that are truly thought-provoking, like the competitive advantage gained by the U.S. through the \\"English language monopoly\\" created by the rapid spread of its technology.

Steve Harmon writes with the same passion he says entrepreneurs must show when they seek funding from venture capital firms. Harmon senses when his information might be overwhelming and regularly offers encouraging words to budding entrepreneurs. He has enlisted the support of several high-profile individuals who have \\"breakout IPO\\" experience. Throughout the book, readers share snippets of Q &amp; A conversations with industry leaders such as Jerry Yang of Yahoo! and Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape.

Worktypes can be a very useful tool for understanding how your personality affects your efficiency at work. Strategies for maximizing your strengths and minimizing your weaknesses are offered as well as tips for dealing with personality types other than your own. Unfortunately, the book offers only a brief description of personality types. For readers to get the full value from this book, it is suggested that they read a book with more detailed descriptions of the 16 types. (The authors suggest the 1989 book, Lifetypes, but any number of books focusing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and psychological type will do.) Without a clear understanding of the 16 psychological types, it is difficult to apply most of the information in the book. However, with an appropriate companion book, Worktypes can be instrumental in your quest to improve your effectiveness at work.

Gubman in a book that gets high marks for its easy, bullet-point organization, but scores in the middle of the curve in terms of originality. Grubman preaches that you must create a strategic alliance between your company&#8217;s mission and competencies and the people who work there. Then, he describes how to motivate and involve people, and finally how to assess their performance. He uses research examples and starts each chapter with a bullet-point summary of key information. The book includes questions to ask yourself, and many useful charts and summary lists. However, the theoretical discussion of how to engage and reward employees seems oddly dry and analytical for a how-to guide on how to motivate and excite people. The areas of job matching, motivation, and assessment have been covered in many other books, but we... recommend Gubman&#8217;s authoritative approach to these topics.	2001-06-01

The clich&eacute;-ridden manifesto on \\"globalism\\" has become a staple of our time, with seemingly every consultant, economist and professor spewing out a book or two about the worldwide economy. Few of these authors ever rise above the self-evident and oft-stated themes of wonderful opportunity and mortal danger. But in World Class, author Rosabeth Moss Kanter presents - hold on to your seats - an innovative analysis of globalization's economic and social trends. While the book can't entirely escape the trite \\"change or die\\" admonitions of the genre, some of her conclusions truly are original: Companies forced to devote their attention to the global stage will gradually lose interest in their traditional local communities, and those communities will be forced to compete with other localities around the world for the privilege of hosting industry. We [...] recommend this book to any executive or student seeking a non-emotional, fact-based look at the implications of globalism for business and society.	2001-06-01

Ideas and messages spread through human communities in the same way that viruses jump from person to person and group to group. This premise - that social trends saturate populations like contagious epidemics - is an intriguing foundation for a book, and indeed, Malcolm Gladwell's examination of the theme is at times a fascinating read. The book is at its best when applying the epidemic theory to marketing by attempting to identify the key individuals that help transmit a trend, or for that matter, a disease. However, Gladwell never quite succeeds in knitting these observations into a cogent and coherent argument. The book reads like a set of notes - some of which come off as unnecessary digressions. But on the basis of those sections that truly illuminate the cycle of trend dissemination, we from getAbstract recommend this book to marketing, advertising and promotional executives.	2001-06-01

Gertrude Stein observed of Ezra Pound that he was a village explainer, and very good to have around if one happened to be a village. Simon Blackburn merits the same level of praise. This book's stated intention is to give readers some sense of how philosophers approach the really big questions of knowledge, free will, God, reasoning, and so on. That's a tall order. Think is better appreciated as a chrestomathy of thought-provoking quotations and asides. The book's strongest points are its useful tips on formulating and analyzing arguments. Incidentally, the politically correct reader will be delighted at Blackburn's bows to gender-neutral language, his digs at the religious right and his sly elbow in the dead ribs of Edmund Burke. We [...] recommend this book for anyone interested in philosophy but short of time, or merely out to impress friends, colleagues and clients by dropping names of celebrity philosophers into conversations or sales pitches.	2001-06-01

Individual investors are constantly frustrated by their inability to beat the market. Most portfolios lag behind benchmarks because investors fall in love with stories and chase stocks with high valuations. Such a strategy (if undisciplined buying and selling can be called a strategy) is exactly the wrong tack to take. James O&#8217;Shaughnessy painstakingly tracked stock returns over a 45-year period and found that investing in companies on traditional value measures &#8212; PE ratios, price-to-sales ratios, and price-to-book ratios &#8212; beat the market. Unfortunately for today&#8217;s investors, the data for this study runs only through 1996, and misses much of Internet boom, in which traditional measures like PE ratios were abandoned with abandon. Nevertheless, we recommend this clear and insightful book to all investors, especially those newcomers who have to this point been carried along by the market bandwagon, but one day might need a crash course in some time-tested investment strategies.	2001-06-01

Winkler offers an insider&#8217;s perspective on how technology has changed marketing and advertising. Writing with clarity and confidence, she outlines the steps advertisers and marketers must take to keep pace. She cites high-profile companies like Dell Computers and Amazon as examples of brands that were built in months, not years. These examples illustrate her sometimes complex concepts, and make them more accessible. Unfortunately, she also devotes a large amount of space to what amounts to a commercial for an adverting software application that she&#8217;s trying to sell. But for readers who can stomach the pitch, we recommend this book to those who work in marketing, advertising, or related industries, and to those who are making the transition to technology-driven brand building. (Editor&#8217;s note: TeamToolz, one of the major resources covered in this book, is a pay-for-use service sold by the author.)	2001-06-01

The bull market has turned value investing into the neglected stepchild of wealth-building strategies. Tech companies have been big winners, and even value investing icon Warren Buffett has fallen on tough times. Still, Timothy P. Vick makes a compelling case for value investing. He dismisses such strategies as timing the market and chasing hot sector stocks as more gambling than investing. Vick argues that investors should seek bargain stocks by studiously researching companies and finding those whose current assets and future growth are undervalued by the market. Vick's useful rules for value investing include this first axiom: You buy cars and clothes on sale, so why not stocks? He lays out tools for determining when a stock is on sale, such as calculating return on equity and profit margins. While the subject matter is arcane, the way Vick conveys his message is easy to understand. We [...] recommend this book to investors on all levels (and it's far more cheery than the news from the market).	2001-06-01

The Venture Capital Cycle is a thorough overview of the venture capital market that will be edifying to those who know little about the mysterious methods of private equity financiers, but self-evident to those with a background in corporate finance. Readers who have worked in or studied finance already are familiar with the tidal cycles that govern the flow of capital into early-stage companies, as well as the process through which money moves from institutions and individuals to fledgling enterprises. But we [...] strongly recommend that entrepreneurs read this book, which provides an exhaustive tour that will answer many - if not all - of your questions about where venture capital comes from, how you can get a hold of some, and how your life and business will change after you do. And if, along the way, you think that the authors sound too much like professors with their dense, academic prose, you're right.	2001-06-01

Gini Graham Scott presents a model for handling any type of conflict using the ERI - emotions, reasons, and intuition - model. With this model, Scott calls for controlling negative emotions (E) and getting them out of the way. Then, she suggests understanding the reasons (R) for the conflict and the different conflict styles that might be used in dealing with it. The last step is and using the intuition (I) to come up with alternatives to choose the best approach. This book is well written in a clear, easy-to-understand style. The illustrations, charts, and fill-in-the-blank questions are especially helpful in showing how to apply the model in your own organization. We [...] recommend this book for executives and managers, although it can be applied by others in the workplace and in everyday life to deal with any kind of conflict.	2001-06-01

This absorbing, practical book advocates the use of behavioral science in the workplace to achieve increased profits. This is a valuable resource for those who work in a group setting because it supplies helpful information on communicating effectively within a team. Author Leslie Wilk Braksick structured the book logically and wrote it clearly. She provides numerous real-life examples of how to apply the principles in the text.

The colorful, almost cartoonish, look and feel of Roberta Roesch's book will probably put off people who prefer to have their solutions shown to them in black and white. And that's a shame because this book is an excellent time-management resource for everyone. Roesch created her book for people who \\"don't have time to read time books,\\" and did a really wonderful job. By eschewing the standard book format, she may have alienated some readers who prefer their books to look serious. But it is precisely this format that encourages readers who wouldn't normally buy time management books to give this one a chance.<br />You can read this book straight through, but its most valuable sections stand on their own. A number of questionnaires help you determine whether the material in a section covers an area that concerns you. The book is also peppered with \\"minutes matter,\\" call-out boxes that offer short time-saving tips. It caters to those with short attention spans, but without being trite. It is particularly useful for those who have purchased time-management books before, but gave up on them out of boredom or frustration. We recommend this book to anyone interested in time-management. In short, if you don't have the time for time management, this book is for you.	2001-06-01

Everyone can use hints for making business and personal conversations more effective. Susan RoAne offers the \\"do's and don'ts,\\" from discussing business during lunch to comforting those in mourning. She even devotes a chapter to effective cyber-chatting. She will make you more aware of your body language, facial expressions, gestures, eye contact, and listening skills. Many of RoAne's suggestions are common-sense and you probably already use them, but not consciously and with much reflection. This may cause you to consider what you do and say, and how you come across. RoAne emphasizes courtesy, respect, and the value of truly listening to others. We recommend this book to help you build confidence and generate lively, informative conversations. Laced with Yiddish expressions and personal experiences, it draws on the author's experiences as the \\"mingling maven\\" keynote speaker.	2001-06-01

Using the approach of an economics business model, John Kay defines the major characteristics firms have used to succeed where others fail. To get on the right side of that fence, he says, work your corporate strengths. Kay maintains that success hinges on distinctive abilities a firm can muster to add value for its particular customers. These unique traits include skills, reputation, and relationships. While the book (and the reader) may choke a bit on the academic charts and examples, real meat is hidden here. On the plus side, Kay writes in a fairly clear, spare style that makes complex ideas easy to follow. On the minus side, he repeats the same basic principles and ideas. While executives might glean some real support for developing their companies' strengths, we [...] recommend his book primarily to business school academics and to those top-level managers interested in studying and applying theoretical models.	2001-06-01

You would be hard-pressed to find a more honest book about business and the often short sighted, un-productive, arbitrary, and just plain stupid decisions made by &#8220;dumb&#8221; managers and leaders. William and Kathleen Lundin articulately challenge the absurdities of corporate culture and the workplace. In this landmark book, they define &#8220;dumb&#8221; quite broadly: it applies to the stupid, the egomaniacal, the dictatorial, the scheming, the manipulative, and even the abusive. First-person accounts from leaders and employees illustrate the authors&#8217; journey through the epidemic dumbness of corporate structure, decision-making, and practice. The authors thoroughly and truthfully present these problems, analyze their impact, and offer remedies. However, their conclusions often clearly indicate that if you are mired in a consistently, terminally dumb workplace, leaving is usually your best option. Don&#8217;t let the juvenile look of the volume throw you. We ... recommend this book to everyone with a job: it&#8217;s that good, like a sharp-witted social commentary delivered by keen observers.	2001-06-01

Ann Svendsen&#8217;s critically acclaimed book is one of the first attempts to define a new relationship between business and its employees, customers and communities. Written in a conversational, intelligent style, The Stakeholder Strategy makes the case for collaborative stakeholder relationships and tries to show companies how they can develop and nurture those relationships for mutual benefit. Regardless of whether you think that Svendsen has succeeded or failed in that goal, the book gives plenty of examples, drawn from diverse industries, to support her claims. At the same time, it doesn&#8217;t get bogged down by endless source notes; the book provides just enough data to make a point and back it up. The book isn&#8217;t a flimsy how-to, nor is it a dry academic tome.  It fits comfortably in the middle by incorporating the best of both approaches.  We at  ... recommend this book to company leaders and managers, as well as anyone &#8212; from life-long employee to adversarial activist &#8212; who falls under the new definition of a corporate stakeholder.	2001-06-01

U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan originated using \\"weightless\\" to describe computer-powered information technology. Diane Coyle employs his metaphor to explain that the European world is afflicted with unemployment and insecurity because of the evolution from industrial output to weightlessness. Her view of the new technology's international economic impact is distinctly European/British. She paints her strategy for managing the digital economy with a colorful but broad brush: better education, international ethical standards, governmental flexibility, liberalism. Her writing features quirky phrases, challenging sentence structure, and a few British spellings. Coyle includes surprising anecdotes and sparkling quotes from diverse sources - a valuable lexicon for further reading. We [...] recommend this book to those with an eclectic, liberal, literate, European view of the difference between the U.S. economic experience and that of the rest of the world. Such a reader will be delighted here.	2001-06-01

Dent may be the one-eyed economist living in the land of the blind. His previous book, The Great Boom Ahead, predicted our current, record-shattering market (although it underestimated its strength). Now he's updated his analysis with a new focus that extends the boom prediction through the end of the current decade. His results may prove more effective than his methodology, because Dent is a futurist who subscribes to a deterministic model. He believes that population growth and technological adoption control economic growth. Upon these foundations, Dent builds a vision of continued, unprecedented growth that may make him Enemy Number One on Alan Greenspan's Irrational Exuberance Most Wanted. But to doubters, Dent can offer the nearly irrefutable: \\"Yeah, but I was right.\\" If you're in business, you should know the basics of Dent's philosophy, and if you're in the markets at all, we [...] recommend that you read this book.

Everything you need to know about how to value a stock is inside this book - somewhere. Finding it however, can be a problem, as it sometimes seems that the editors used the random dart theory of selection in putting together the chapters. For example, in order to understand the concepts presented in Chapter two, you need information that is contained in Chapters three and five. Once you figure out how to navigate it, though, this book is a valuable resource and a powerful educational tool for investors from neophyte to intermediate. It's encyclopedic in its scope, and the pages in the included glossary are sure to become dog-eared from use. We [...] recommend this book to investors of all levels. Beginners will learn critical concepts and terms, while more experienced investors will come to rely on this book as a trusted reference companion.	2001-06-01

Peter Drucker's philosophies and theories have shaped management all over the world. Drucker is highly respected. He has always taught that people are an organization's most important resource. In 1954, Drucker virtually invented 'management.' Although, of course, management existed before, nobody had ever treated it as a distinct field.<br />Jack Beatty's book about Peter Drucker is not just another biography. Beatty criticizes Drucker in some areas and extols his virtues in others. The book is sometimes entertaining and consistently well written. Enough of Drucker's ideas are included to make you want to read his books. Most of the book summarizes Drucker's work chronologically.

Reina and Michelle L. Reina discuss the importance of having a strong sense of trust in the workplace. They advocate avoiding both the major and minor betrayals that undermine trust. Creating an environment that promotes trust contributes to effectiveness in the workplace, especially during times of rapid change. The book discusses the nature and effect of trust. It is enhanced with a variety of exercises that promote workplace dialogues and help people think through the issue of trust. Many of these exercises are especially suited for teams, work groups and divisions. The exercises facilitate discussing and resolving problems in a more trusting atmosphere.

If you want to learn change management strategies, sooner or later you're going to have to pick up consultant-ese.

You are, he says, the sum total of your genetics and environment plus your personal push. But Marsan is also smart enough not to get down into the gutter with the nature vs. nurture debate. He is really interested in how you move past your genetics and environment to chart a course that brings out your potential for genius. In this sense, he is asking everyone who reads his book to return to childhood, when they felt free to live, love, and learn. But he doesn&#8217;t offer just platitudes; he recommends concrete steps to help you make this trip, like advising you to study your family history and examine your ancestors for traits and talents that could be hidden in you.

John Bryan Starr presents an overview of China, including its geography, history, political system, economy, and social-cultural system. His excellent, in-depth analysis discusses various Chinese institutions and issues, including the military, the educational system, urban and rural problems, population growth, environment degradation, human rights, culture, and intellectual freedom. However, you should view this book as a background introduction, since most of its information dates from research completed by 1995. For the latest developments in China, refer to more current sources. The book, which is written directly and clearly without academic jargon, is directed primarily toward westerners, particularly in the United States.

Reading Understanding Media brings to mind the old line that Shakespeare's plays are nothing but a bunch of clich&eacute;s. McLuhan's 1964 look at the impact of technology and communications on society is laced with phrases that have become fixtures of modern language, like `Global Village', `Age of Information' and `The medium is the message'. The book seeks to tie together big themes like art, culture, and social and economic history. While often successful at drawing these sweeping connections, McLuhan in certain chapters wanders into what sound like self-indulgent lectures. His analysis of television as a \\"cool\\" or low-resolution medium is dated. Phrases like \\"dig it\\" and too-numerous references to \\"the bomb,\\" Mad magazine and skin-divers clearly belong to the early 1960s. But this book is valuable for its prophetic analyses. McLuhan's prediction of an emerging information-based economy and a global integration facilitated by the Internet and digital technologies is stunningly accurate. We [...] recommend Understanding Media to executives working in media, telecommunications and technology, all of whom should have at least a passing knowledge of this classic.	2001-06-01

Harrison Owen suggests that there is a gap in leadership, because we are going through chaotic, transforming times, and traditional leaders can no longer be in control and protect us from it. However, instead of looking for leadership in the few or &quot;the One,&quot; we should recognize that all individuals have the capacity for leadership and, through self-organizing activity, appropriate leadership will emerge for different tasks. He is especially impressed by the power of the informal organization to achieve results and for true leadership to emerge from the interaction of people in this informal milieu. He identifies leadership with the power of Spirit to inspire others. Five functions of leadership are the focus of the book: evoking Spirit with vision, growing Spirit with collective storytelling, sustaining Spirit with structure, comforting Spirit at the end, and reviving Spirit to move through a period of grief at endings and move on.<br />The book is written as an essay or narrative, with observations, examples, and opinions about what could or should be. While Owen's book reflects a trend in business to provide more meaning and purpose through spiritual underpinnings, some may find his discussion of &quot;Spirit&quot; somewhat fuzzy and hard to grasp. The language of the book is occasionally rambling and his claims don't always seem totally convincing.	2001-06-01

He analyzes all major foreign policy positions from the intellectual ground staked out by the major political writers of each period.

Joël De Rosnay's book is a gold mine of provocative ideas about the evolution of mankind, economics, politics and more. It pulls together information from organic chemistry, computer technology, chaos theory and a slew of unrelated fields to argue for a less egocentric approach to business and government. In the process, it redefines competitiveness and industry. This eloquent presentation is definitely not a light read. It is mind-boggling in scope but fractal in delivery - which means you can delve into virtually any section and get a feel for its message. Business wisdom is spotty here, but this is not a business book. Instead, it's more of a cross between Wired magazine and an intricately researched science fiction novel. It is not for the faint of heart (or brain), but we [...] recommend it, if you'd like to stimulate your mind, shake up your old beliefs, check the inventiveness of bold technological projections, or glimpse an exciting future.	2001-06-01

This hands-on book is directed to those involved in setting up, leading or coaching teams. While the authors include some intriguing examples of successful teams, this is more of a workbook that describes the procedures for setting up teams and measuring their performance. Practical executives will find lists of questions to ask and steps to take in this well-organized description of the managerial process, from setting up teams to rewarding successful efforts. The book is clearly written, despite some long, unwieldy sentences.

Former Texas Governor Ann Richards once delivered this unforgettable quip about George W. Bush: \\"Poor George, he was born with a silver foot in his mouth.\\" Basically, that line has defined the media's portrayal of Bush ever since. He is depicted as the privileged, but none-too-bright scion of a political dynasty. Of course, as is the case with all really good insults, there is more than a little truth to Richard's words. But is there more to the man? That's the critical question of the 2000 presidential election, and for an answer, we at getAbstract.com recommend Elizabeth Mitchell's skillfully written account of the pampered life and tobacco-chewing times of W. Although the Bush family declined to cooperate with this particular bio, many family friends offered their insights, and the figure that emerges from their descriptions is far more complex than his late-night comedy caricature might suggest. Mitchell's superbly documented research reveals that the man who many imply is running for office simply because he has nothing better to do, is in fact guided by two powerful motives: personal redemption and family revenge. The latter agenda is clear: W. will avenge his father's defeat by striking down Al Gore, heir to the Clinton legacy. The personal redemption is a bit more difficult to isolate, but has something to do with measuring up to his father and discrediting critics like Ann Richards, who is, as we mentioned, the former governor of Texas.

Two original devices set There are No Limits apart from other inspirational texts, and in order to fully appreciate Danny Cox's book, you'll have to make full use of both. At regular intervals throughout the course of the book, Cox inserts \\"Immediate Actions\\" and \\"Points to Ponder.\\" By suggesting through these sections concrete steps that you can take right away, the book surpasses many of its peers, which often fail to find ground amid lofty hyperbole. But the practical nature of this book can only be realized if you actually take the recommended steps as you read, and gloss over some jargon-laden prose (\\"Appoint yourself the dean of Every Day University\\"). Cox, an Air Force veteran, draws on his personal experiences, as well as those of high-profile celebrities and authors to illustrate his ideas. While he wrote the book for a general audience, we recommend it particularly to salespeople, or those charged with managing or motivating a sales force.	2001-06-01

Robert Fritz takes a novel approach to corporate organizational theory by framing his book around the laws of nature. Fritz is especially attached to the law that states that energy follows the path of least resistance, and in this book, he urges managers to utilize this principle in reshaping their organizations. Once you get past this conceptual foundation, however, the advice that's offered here will sound pretty familiar to anyone acquainted with the basics of strategic planning. Form a central vision, create attainable goals, break goals down into smaller steps, assess your results, adjust your strategies; these techniques are all mentioned. But Fritz's adoption of scientific and engineering principles for management purposes, combined with the accompanying charts and examples, make the book an engaging read, despite the less-than-original conclusions. We [...] recommend this book to executives, managers and individuals who are looking for a new, if slightly theoretical, view of how to organize their companies or their lives.	2001-05-31

It builds on many themes developed in Korten&#8217;s previous book, When Corporations Rule the World (1995). Many in the world of business and finance will not like this book because it posits the radical restructuring of economic systems, specifically suggesting the elimination of capitalism. This book was meant for CEOs who have the power to institute the changes Korten recommends. However, its radical perspective probably means that the book will be more widely read by CEOs of corporations which already have an environmental focus and by the leaders of environmental organization.

Of teams and families it might be said, \\"Each is dysfunctional in its own special way.\\" Today's corporate litany states that to succeed we must learn to cooperate more closely. The testing ground for this idea becomes trendy \\"cross-functional teams\\" or task forces. Here, antisocial tendencies and hidden agendas are sprinkled across meeting-room tables like dragon's teeth, springing up to mortally wound the best interests of your organization. The good news is that you can do something to help your organization's teams operate more effectively. Robbins and Finley are a couple of skilled veterans who say that \\"trust is the blood of teams.\\" If you believe better teamwork is critical to your company's future, we think you will find the lessons in this book absolutely essential - whether you're a member of a team or the leader who serves them.	2001-05-31

Leider believes everyone needs to find an individual sense of unique purpose. When you have this sense of purpose, you can use it as a central core of direction to guide your life and give it meaning. The book is simply written, easy to understand and targeted to a general audience. However, it also seems quite repetitious, in that the same ideas are explained many different ways. Some of these concepts are quite familiar, echoing some basic ideas about the importance of having a sense of mission, path, and goals, much like Laurie Beth Jones' book, The Path: Creating Your Mission Statement.... Finally, while some readers may respond deeply to Leider's spiritual and religious references, others may find them problematic, given the split in the business community about spirituality in the workplace.

This book makes several excellent points about strategy.

Readers will miss little if they skip the CEO interviews, which might have provided interesting and informative insights had the author not chosen to focus on compliments to himself and his firm. But the bullet-point outlines of the strategic thinking process will be an eye-opener for many managers unaccustomed to thinking in this manner, and the section is illustrated robustly with real-life examples. Robert&#8217;s analysis of the driving forces of various businesses makes the entire effort worthwhile. ...get this book for executives and entrepreneurs in any industry.	2001-05-31

Friedman explains that the old world order of the Cold War has been replaced by a new paradigm of globalization. In this system, finance, information and technology are being democratized. The Lexus automotive brand of the title is the emblem of globalization. The Olive Tree stands for deep local cultural connections. The tension between globalization and cultural identity is the defining conflict of the new era. Friedman excels at making connections among diverse events and is a brilliant storyteller. He is particularly good at translating complex ideas into vivid, clear, colloquial language. His observations seem so simple that it is easy to miss how profound they are. His arguments seem almost irrefutable. He is basically optimistic and chooses not to dwell much on the dangers implicit in this new world. We recommend the book to everybody.

As any consultant - and author Jack Phillips - will tell you, the days when a consultant could make a living by sharing the latest trendy approaches to business are long, long gone. Today's executives expect consultants to adhere to the same standards of accountability that consultants themselves have advocated for years. Therefore, the ability to determine a consulting project's return on investment is an important skill for both executives and the consultants they hire. Phillips offers a practical approach to ROI that somehow avoids consulting jargon and complex formulas. Although it lacks case studies that show how to overcome specific obstacles to data collection and interpretation, this is a valuable book that fills in an important piece of the consulting puzzle. Best of all, it does so in a common-sense way that can be understood by carbon-based life forms, therefore we [...] recommend this book to consultants and those who hire them.	2001-05-29

Eugene Linden explains that most of civilization's history has included long periods of remarkable stability, including the last few decades. However, stability is not the norm and indications show it is ending. Thanks to overpopulation, technological change and environmental degradation, profound instability is likely in this century. The clues to future instability are in plain sight. You can see them when you compare what has happened in the past to what is likely to happen in the future.<br />In the first half of this book, Linden makes a persuasive case for some of his basic predictions, though he is definitely a pessimist. The scenarios in the second half of the book, intended to illustrate what will happen if these predictions come true, are really speculative fiction masquerading as futurology. Still, Linden's basic premise is sound and his warnings should be taken seriously. We... recommend the book to those involved in long-range business planning and trend research.	2001-05-29

You can make your company more customer-driven using CVM, which he developed at IBM and then implemented at other U.S. and international companies. Thompson identifies the customer's vision of ideal value, and tells businesses to use that as their guiding star. If you can integrate the best customer value in every system, your company can retain customers, sell more and increase profits. This is not a new theme, but Thompson takes it a little deeper than most as he discusses ways to strategically incorporate CVM, from top management to the front desk.

If the wildly successful Who Moved My Cheese? represents the kindergarten version of basic change management theory, The End of Change makes a welcomed leap to graduate-level studies. Authors Peter Scott-Morgan, Erik Hoving, Henk Smith and Arnoud Van Der Slot maintain that many of the concepts intrinsic in the current genre of change management are just plain wrong. In reality, companies that successfully manage change do so by building structures specifically designed to induce and digest change into their overall organizations. In order to explain these structures, the authors present them in the form of geometric shapes - a metaphor that is easy to grasp and easily captures the essence of each strategy. These graphic examples are reinforced with real-life examples of companies and industries that manage change in ways that closely resemble the book's shape-based techniques. We [...] recommend that all executives and students read this book, which takes a sophisticated approach to a topic that has been addressed by a slew of authors and consultants-turned-authors on the most superficial of levels.	2001-05-29

Aspatore is quick to point out, the traders referred to in the title of his book are not the millions of people trading stocks online. Instead, they are a more sophisticated bunch with arsenals of DSL lines and Nasdaq Level 2 screens. Does that mean they are more successful than their counterparts on the World Wide Web? Aspatore says they are. He offers more than a dozen question-and-answer sessions with upbeat electronic traders who are jazzed by their own success. Not answered is this: If electronic traders have a competitive advantage over online traders due to better technology and information, what kind of an advantage do Wall Street trading houses have over individual electronic traders? We recommend this book to prospective day traders as a source for plenty of useful trading insights, but with this advice: Seek a cautionary note somewhere else.	2001-05-29

The horizontal organization is a more appropriate model for the knowledge age, according to author Frank Ostroff, who says companies increasingly find this structure more effective. He emphasizes the need to start with an understanding of your organization's core competencies and to develop a horizontal structure from there. Ostroff claims this is the first model of this approach, but it is not. In fact, his fairly academic book advances a trend that is already well documented. Horizontal organizations have been covered in numerous other books, which, like this one, promote more decentralized, downsized, team-oriented organizations with empowered workers. Despite a leaden, pedantic writing style, Ostroff distinguishes his theoretical discussion with several detailed examples of how the horizontal organization works and how you can apply it to your company. We ... recommend this book primarily to academics, who may enjoy its theoretical nature.	2001-05-29

Raisel describes the problem-solving process used by McKinsey &amp; Company, a well-known corporate consulting firm. The book offers easily digested tips. The insightful section on conducting interviews and the tips on building teamwork are particularly useful. However, because the author and other McKinsey consultants are prohibited by confidentiality agreements from discussing the specifics of their cases, the book lacks real-world examples of the firm's problem-solving approaches. We [...] recommend this book to managers seeking useful information and problem solving techniques.	2001-05-29

Harry Beckwith is considered nearly godlike in the marketing world. In this book, as in his previous bestseller, Selling the Invisible, he offers wise and witty on-target assessments about human nature. His candid observations come from his extensive experience as head of his own marketing firm. Written in an intelligent, conversational style, this breezy book gets right to the heart of what works and what doesn't in marketing. Beckwith breaks open every myth and standard business practice in the industry. He incorporates plenty of examples and anecdotes, not just from the business world, but from literature, pop culture, the arts, history, and more. Praised by industry leaders and book reviewers, this savvy little volume has more insight than ten other books combined. We [...] recommend this book for anyone conducting any kind of business.	2001-05-29

Throw the old rules of traditional sales out the window. Stephen E. Heiman and his co-authors, Diane Sanchez and Tad Tuleja, state in no uncertain terms that to remain a successful sales professional, you need to change the way you view the selling process.

The book includes &#8220;personal workshops&#8221; to allow you to apply these concepts directly to your sales situation. We ...recommend this book to anyone frustrated by the limitations of product-pitch selling. Note: This book is a revision of Conceptual Selling (by Robert Bruce Miller with Heiman and Tuleja, Warner Books, 1987), which has been updated to reflect the economy of today and tomorrow.	2001-05-29

Just pick up Bill Capodagli and Lynn Jackson's book describing the ten key success secrets of the Disney Company. The secrets derive from four basic tenets: dream, believe, dare and do. The authors show how these principles led to Walt Disney's success, and how other companies can use them. They include a Disney history to illustrate how the company has applied its principles from films to video to theme parks - including how Disney has learned from its problems and failures. They provide examples of how other companies have applied the Disney Way. We [...] recommend this excellent book to anyone with an interest in business strategy or marketing. While the principles it outlines may be familiar, Capodagli and Jackson demonstrate in an original way just how these principles can contribute to success beyond the Magic Kingdom.	2001-05-29

Hoffherr and Robert P. Reid argue that creativity is not reserved for the few. Rather, it is a skill all humans can develop - if they are willing to step back from their day-to-day routines and focus on their inner lives. This book is a mind-altering system. It is packed with quotes, cartoons, graphs, and exercises to help individuals and organizations realize their creative potential. If the writing seems redundant at times, it is only because the authors want you to be able to open the book anywhere and learn something quickly - and you can. We [...] recommend this book and its CD-ROM package to high-level managers looking to shake things up in the office or in their personal lives. But lower-level employees who want to move up in the world will benefit from it as well.	2001-05-29

Buchanan argues that free trade is destroying the United States. He is particularly concerned with the loss of U.S. workers' traditional industrial jobs to overseas countries, a trend he feels undermines the U.S. middle class. He argues for a return to higher tariffs to protect U.S. industries and for an end to the country's membership in mutual trade pacts and organizations such as the United Nations. Many readers, especially those in business and top management, may find his basic premises flawed, even irrational, since his arguments seem as if he wants to turn back the clock. These ideas appear considerably out of touch with the realities of modern technology, particularly since he sees multinational and transnational corporations as a threat to American society, rather than as sources of new possibilities. He doesn't acknowledge the alternative of retraining displaced workers. Buchanan advocates an isolationist United States which exists in a protected cocoon. He also seems to want career women to return to the home. If he is planning to run for the U.S. Presidency again, this book will not help. Nonetheless, we from getAbstract recommend this book to those who are curious about this political figure's views or who wish to examine his arguments against free trade.	2001-05-29

To help you become a better leader as an executive, Alan Downs teaches you how to get through your fears and trust your own talents. He focuses on how to gain the confidence to be yourself. After that, your goal should be to bring passion to whatever you do. While many of these ideas will be familiar to readers of self-help literature, Downs does a good job of adding a unique spin with his examples of classic and present-day stories that illustrate long-held fears. He organizes his material in an effective, easy-to-read way and suggests that overcoming fears is only a step on the road to self-confidence. This leaves the reader with plenty to chew on, marking this book as a better than average self-help guide and earning it a recommendation in this category from us [...].	2001-05-29

This book tells the story of Starbucks' meteoric rise- how a few stores in Seattle grew into more than 1,600 stores worldwide. Starbucks built its brand by putting people, both employees and customers, first and by emphasizing product quality over marketing. Starbucks founder Howard Schultz and reporter Dori Jones Yang have written a fascinating, inspiring, and highly readable book. It emphasizes business wisdom over business tips. Schultz focuses on stories that emphasize how enthusiasm, romance, and passion can get the job done. He also talks about he turned a small business into a ubiquitous business that opens a new store almost every day. This book tells one of the most amazing, important business stories in recent years.

Reich hasn't really unearthed any strikingly original discoveries in his look at the new economy, but the sheer power of his intellect allows him to follow well-documented trends to fresh conclusions. After restating the many economic benefits that technology has wrought in the past decade, Reich moves to the topic about which he's most passionate: the changing dynamics of the labor market and the implications of these changes on unskilled workers. Most interesting is his take on the diminished importance of the family and the undermining of social relationships, trends that he says have turned community into a kind of commodity that can be bought and sold. Although he prepared the book during the high-tech boom, he foreshadows the bursting bubble, using examples from familiar news stories in effective and novel ways to support his analysis. We [...] recommend this thoughtful book to anyone concerned about the future of workers, both skilled and unskilled.	2001-05-25

You can achieve better brand recognition and sales if you understand how the mind works. Jack Trout (assisted by Steve Rifkin) emphasizes that the human mind is limited, hates confusion and easily loses focus. The authors cite companies that have succeeded in their brand strategy and advertising by following these principles, and a few who failed because they didn't. The book concludes with \\"tricks of the trade\\" that you can use. In keeping with these principles, the volume is simply and clearly written, brief, well organized and focused. However, since it was published about four years ago and talks about the beginning of the information age, some of the material already may sound familiar. But if you can ignore that sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, the book offers an excellent summary of the relationship between how the mind works and how best to use product positioning.

Laurie Beth Jones zeroes in on the qualities that made Jesus a successful leader, one of the most respected and beloved in human history. This book introduces you to Jesus, the executive, not Jesus, the religious messiah. The book is not written as a Christian guide to leadership. In fact, it isn't written as a continuous narrative at all. Jones offers many sayings based on Jesus' biblical teachings and the qualities he demonstrated. She poses each saying or quotation as a separate lesson accompanied a couple of pages of description and interesting examples. A widely praised, national best seller, this book is engaging, delightfully written, detailed yet concise, and witty. It presents what amounts to a very fleshed-out list of leadership attributes.

David Cohan's book is too useful to read in linear progression. Each chapter is a self-contained unit composed of an e-commerce problem, a case study analyzing how one company attempted to solve the problem, and a series of principles for effective problem solving. The book presents all aspects of e-commerce in useful detail, from motivating the reluctant CEO to managing the implementation of an e-commerce project. This book is for senior executives and change leaders, but it is useful to anyone who wants to learn more about the process of designing, developing, and implementing an e-commerce project. Project managers and consultants also will find the book useful because it presents the e-commerce buyer's perspective in straightforward detail.

This is either a stunning expos&eacute; or a masterly forgery. Even its editors are not entirely sure which it is because it is impossible to verify the authenticity of the documents presented here, which the compiler - who uses a pseudonym - delivered to a leading American Sinologist. The documents purport to record the most secret deliberations of China's leaders, as well as the information upon which they based their 1989 decision to unleash armed forces against the peaceful demonstrators who occupied Tiananmen Square. After careful checking, the editors deemed the documents authentic because they possess \\"an internal coherence, richness and human believability that would be impossible to fake.\\" The Chinese government denounced them as forgeries, as was to be expected, true or false. We [...] believe the documents have enough verisimilitude to offer an instructive, useful picture of how China's system works.

Weiss documents the way populations have fractured into different demographic and lifestyle groups, or clusters. He gives these clusters catchy names that describe the key lifestyle features which influence their buying behavior, voting, and other choices. This excellent, original, well-researched book focuses on clusters in the U.S., though Canada and Europe are sometimes cited. The book is written in an easy-to-read style, but some may find it difficult to read because of the wealth of detail. Sometimes, it is hard to keep the various clusters straight, particularly in the first few chapters when Weiss refers to them without defining them. However, definition is difficult. These groups are composed of many characteristics, as becomes clear in the last chapter describing the United States' 62 clusters.

Little can be written that hasn't already been said about Peter M. Senge's classic on organizational learning. So let's keep this review simple: If you haven't read this book, read it now. When this seminal work was originally published in 1990, it was truly ahead of its time in its identification and description of the learning organization. But more than a decade later this concept has become a central component to organizational development, and if you somehow missed Senge's prescient analysis of the evolution of business, work and employment, you're more than a step behind. Why? Because Senge has the rare ability to break new ground in theory and then apply these abstract advances into concrete practices that businesses can emulate. We [...] almost hesitate to call this book a classic, since the term often brings to mind unread tomes that do little but look impressive on a shelf. The Fifth Discipline is a book that should be read, and perhaps re-read, by anyone who earns a living in the corporate world.	2001-05-14

Dan Schiller's book is an exhaustive history and analysis of network deregulation, the Internet, and the emerging global economic order. In this academic work, Schiller examines the social and political issues of the Internet, the new economic landscape. He is, above all, a critic of the political realities that shaped the Internet. He laments its lack of social and \\"welfarist\\" features and argues that a system created by market forces to serve market forces can only exacerbate existing inequities. His dry, academic tone still reveals a little emotion, making it clear that Schiller is no cheerleader for the neo-liberal orientation he perceives on the Internet. Is there an overt political slant to the book? You might say that. We [...] recommend it to students of economics, social sciences, and communications, and to anyone else with a good political filter who wants to better understand the Internet's impact on the global economy, albeit from a U.S. perspective.	2001-05-10

Schwartz examines competition in the world of Web commerce, today's most rapidly changing business environment. He compares this competitive struggle to the battle between species that occurs in the natural environment. He concludes that the companies that succeed must be better to survive, much like the survival of the fittest in nature. Whatever market niche they select, they have to be \\"smarter, faster, more innovative, and more adaptable\\" than ever, so that they do better than their competitors. After examining the successes and failures of many different e-commerce competitors, the author identifies seven key strategies to survive and thrive on the Web. Digital Darwinism uses detailed case studies and examples to show how different companies have employed the stated principles successfully. Each chapter concludes with a brief summary of the major points to apply, based on these examples of success. It is a kind of example of \\"digital Darwinism\\" itself, in that the author applies the value-added principles he advocates to create an easy-to-read book. We [...] recommend this well-organized book to executives who manage or do business with Web-based corporations.	2001-05-10

Today, business is complicated - so complicated in fact, that it's no longer possible for a company to make all of its decisions at the top. Steve Yearout, Gerry Miles and Richard Koonce have a simple message for anyone competing in these complex times: When you can no longer rely on a few talented individuals to run the entire show, developing leadership throughout your organization becomes your most critical business strategy. This book should be required reading for executives who fail to grasp this essential connection between employee development and success. Cleverly weaving informative case studies with engaging concepts, the authors explain how to nurture a sustainable supply of leaders within an organization, from top to bottom. We [...] strongly recommend this book - and its systematic approach to identifying and grooming future leaders - to human resources development and training professionals, executive coaches and business executives of any stripe.	2001-05-10

The 3 Keys to Empowerment revisits the three keys discussed in another Blanchard book, Empowerment Takes More Than a Minute. These three keys are: share information with everyone, create autonomy through boundaries and let teams become the hierarchy. They should be applied to each of the three stages of moving toward empowerment. Many of the actions suggested for the initial stage: \\"Starting and Orienting the Journey,\\" are repeated in the discussions of the other stages, \\"Change and Discouragement\\" and \\"Adopting and Refining Empowerment.\\" The authors say some areas need repeated focus so readers can implement change. Unfortunately, this is repetitive.<br />The book's most useful feature is the Empowerment Action Plan, a clear, easy to follow list of specific actions leaders can take at each stage of the journey to empowerment. The 3 Keys is written for CEOs and senior executives.	2001-05-08

Toogood is a top executive communications expert, an established speaker (who used to be a TV reporter and network news producer), trainer, and writer, so he draws upon a vast amount of useful and successful tips for anyone interested in becoming a top-notch communicator. Although this book is written in a conversational, accessible style, you won't find any fluff and filler, just on-target training. He covers planning your talk, speech, or presentation; your delivery and appearance; and pitfalls to avoid. He tells you how to deal with visual aids, Q&amp;A sessions, and even the media. The author stresses that the book's instructions can make anyone an effective and dazzling conversationalist, not just a great speechmaker, though both are well-rewarded skills. We [...] recommend this book to every professional, on every level, and to those who would like to excel as communicators.	2001-05-08

Connie Brown Glaser and Barbara Steinberg Smalley argue that female managers no longer need to act like men to be successful. Instead, women managers should depend on their natural attributes - intuition, nurturing, having respect for individuals - to create webs rather than hierarchies. This bold, timely book is packed with profiles of women who have succeeded on their own terms. The writing is lean and cuts to the chase. We [...] recommend this book as a likely inspiration and a helpful guide to most women (particularly managers) trying to cope with the old folkways of corporate America. The male manager will also find that it offers him a new perspective at work and a wake-up call at home. [Note: This book is not linked to Harvey MacKay's Swim With the Sharks, which focuses on selling, negotiating, and marketing.]	2001-05-08

The dust cover claims this book is worth its weight in gold. Its last chapter, which outlines the 20 steps to earning $100,000 a year, could well make it so. If you buy the book, read the final chapter first. D.A. Benton&#8217;s 20 steps are clear and easy to follow. Once you know them, the rest of the book provides excellent supporting information. Benton shows examples of how specific individuals (many of them high-profile celebrities and athletes) used each step to achieve success. This book offers no get-rich-quick schemes. The author advocates a logical, methodical approach to making $100,000 per year. She is so confident that she makes a guarantee: If you put maximum effort into all 20 steps, you will become a member of the $100,000 Club. We [...] recommend this book to anyone interested in making a six-figure income.	2001-05-08

Laura Berman Fortgang introduces the concept of the personal career coach, someone who encourages people to take charge of their lives in and out of the office. Personal coaches push employees to find out what they really want from their careers and get it, by locating and overcoming obstructions in their lives, being self-disciplined, and planning systematically. This concise, well-written book offers lots of examples from Fortgang's own coaching experience. Although it is probably more useful as a psychological manifesto than as a strict business guide, we from getAbstract recommend this book as a step in the right direction for those who wish to energize their careers.	2001-05-08

This book is an e-commerce primer. Although its material can seem dated (which happens quickly in this environment), the book is valuable for those who want a historical overview of Internet commerce and technology. Yes, e-commerce has changed so much so quickly that any analysis of Peapod, Streamline, and other e-tailers may seem naïve. But Paul May's discussion of the movement from fat to thin client architecture is interesting and relevant. (One only wishes that the WAP discussion went further!) While this book may not be for every executive or change leader, we [...] recommend it to marketing directors as a valuable bridge between business and technology. It also can benefit those who want a strong, but not dauntingly deep, technical overview.	2001-05-08

He explains each of the 100 laws in philosophical, behavioral, and practical detail. Then he applies them to various aspects of business, career enhancement, creativity, and financial reward.

Joseph Jaworski was a practicing litigator when he learned about the concept of the \\"servant leader.\\" Inspired, he left his legal practice and created the American Leadership Forum (ALF), which trains corporate leaders in using the servant-leader model. Synchronicty, which recounts Jaworski's journey, aspires to novelistic drama, and in fact, Jaworski describes the tale in terms of the traditional literary hero's quest. While not exactly the labors of Hercules, anecdotes in which Jaworski talks his way out of a mugging and meets his wife by passing her in an airport are entertaining, but less informative than the author might hope. The book contains a lot of New-Age jargon and collective-consciousness sermonizing. Nevertheless, for managers who want to be something more - leaders - we [...] recommend Synchronicity not as a useful how-to, but rather as a business leader's inspirational biography.	2001-05-08

Great authors, historians, musicians, and sports stars are usually included in end of the year \\"best\\" lists. Managers rarely show up on such lists. This book highlights 75 history-making management decisions that changed the way we think, live, and work. The decisions profiled remind executives that great management requires experience, vision, the ability to take risks, and good luck. This entertaining volume also covers 21 truly mistaken management decisions, a valuable contrast.

Smith would be equally at home in the business or self-help section of a bookstore. Its message is as applicable to a CEO of a large company as it is to a recent high school graduate. Smith liberally peppers the book with anecdotes. These amusing stories provide interesting breaks from the instructional tone he uses in describing the ten natural laws for managing your time and your life. They also help put his abstract concepts - like the Franklin Reality Model and Personal Productivity Pyramid - into an easier-to-understand context. The stories illustrate the concepts of the book in terms everyone can understand.

Books	4	1	1	N	N	A Good Read!	This book is a primer for anyone who wants coaching in how to structure your life to maximize your success. The coaching is scientifically oriented, yet the book is imminently practical. Science is used to describe and explain the benefits of the suggested techniques, not to challenge the reader. More specifically, science is used to support numerous non-scientific coaching concepts, which could not be scientifically explained until recently.

Companies like to say that they encourage their employees to participate thoroughly in the business, but when it comes to actually handing over power to their subordinates, many executives balk. Patricia McLagan and Christo Nel say that companies and bosses that refuse to take the participatory plunge are doomed to extinction. In The Age of Participation, they present the concept of participation - the active involvement of all employees or citizens in every aspect of running an organization - as a worldview, not just a business method. Sure the book contains more than its share of platitudes, but it is well written and never dry. And it balances its more utopian pronouncements with some practical observations about the performance of companies that have implemented participatory strategies and some insightful points on the role of common sense in business decision making. We [...] recommend this book to executives and mid-level managers, particularly change managers and human resource professionals.	2001-05-08

Axelrod presents a model for creating more effective change in an organization by involving everyone in the change process from the beginning. He suggests setting up large conferences with cross-functional, multidisciplinary planning and implementation groups. As this implies, he advocates combining planning and implementation, rather than creating parallel processes. He argues that the top-down approach of having a leader who sells a vision to the organization doesn't work, although the leader should be involved in the conference process. It seems shortsighted to dismiss visionary leadership, with its successful track record in various settings, yet Axelrod has organized his ideas clearly. He provides tools for using his approach, including anecdotal success stories, how-to inserts, and guidelines for following this process. His model shares some characteristics of other conference planning approaches, including \\"Future Search.\\" However, we [...] recommend this engagingly written book for its appeal to executives and top managers who seek intriguing planning and change strategies.	2001-05-08

For most of this book, Dr. Richard Shoup explains the mysterious forces that cause people to believe that they don't control their own lives. He defines chaos, luck, and karma, and gives readers strategies they can use to exert control over these life forces. These descriptions are interesting, but the most useful section is the seven-step action plan for taking control of your life at the back of the book. This simple guide is useful for anyone making a significant life change, from losing weight to taking up a new career. Shoup cites many examples and clearly believes anyone can change. He is upbeat but realistic about the challenges that change presents. The book offers a process, not a \\"quick fix,\\" but if you or someone close to you is on the cusp of a serious change or needs encouragement to take control, we [...] recommend this book to you.	2001-05-08

Organizations have their own personalities, as William Bridges demonstrates by applying the most popular personality test ever devised for humans to groups of people working together. Bridges developed the &#8220;Organizational Character Index&#8221; (OCI) from the ubiquitous Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator. While OCI thus far lacks the rigorous testing of hundreds of certified Myers-Briggs trainers, intuitively the model makes sense. Bridges provides a useful way of thinking about organizational styles and tries to understand the nature of departments within organizations. Abundant examples, lists and charts help illustrate the principles. We...recommend this book to managers and human resource professionals seeking insight into the nuances of organizational development, provided that they are willing to spoon through a certain amount of alphabet soup. (Note: Though this book has a 2000 copyright date, with the exception of a new forward by Sandra Krebs Hirsh, it is a republication of a work written in about 1990.)	2001-05-08

Read this book and become instantly familiar with the latest, most successful, and even the trendiest theories of change management. The editors have evaluated 18 leading change methods, as applied and tested by some of the largest corporations in the United States. They group the change methods by functional categories, making it easier for readers to go directly to the method that applies to their particular problem. Another bonus: The leading practitioners in the field write the change method chapters, bringing a unique depth of perspective. The editors also have written several excellent chapters on the nature of change. An extraordinary comparative matrix - worth the price of the book by itself - is included in the \\"Afterword.\\" We [...] recommend this book to executives, managers, change agents, human resources professionals and students.	2001-05-08

This book could more accurately be titled \\"How to Ruthlessly Lie, Manipulate and Use Mind Games To Make a Sale.\\" If you're looking for a no-holds-barred guide to getting your way - not just in closing a sale, but in everything you do - this is for you. This exceedingly detailed, candidly written guide to mind control sold more than a million copies. James W. Pickens uses anecdotes sparingly, but weaves in plenty of examples. In a strange contrast to the cutthroat main text, each chapter ends with a short, sweet reference to his mentor Sam. Here's the scoop on genuinely caring about your clients while shamelessly using mind control techniques on them - a contradiction that troubles the author not at all. We from getAbstract recommend this book, as protection, to anyone who buys anything, and, as ammunition, to anyone who sells anything.	2001-05-08

While much has been written on the topic of workplace violence, much less attention is paid to a more widespread problem - workplace bullying. Gary and Ruth Namie claim that one in five workers in the U.S. have been targeted by a bullying colleague or, more commonly, a bullying boss. The authors flesh out this claim in The Bully at Work by describing the prevalence of workplace bullying and the corrosive effects that such behavior has upon its targets. But the real value in this book comes from the detailed advice it provides to bullying victims. The Namies tell victims how to cope with the stress and other psychological wounds that bullying can cause, and then unveil a step-by-step action plan. This plan stretches from initial internal measures that victims can take to defend themselves to - employers take careful note - legal recourse. This eminently useful guide elevates the book beyond the reach of self-empowerment literature and into the realm of practical knowledge. As such, we [...] recommend this book to any employee who has been bruised by a workplace bully, and to managers who are - like it or not - responsible for spotting and eliminating bullying behavior.	2001-05-08

Move over, Evelyn Wood. Instead of speed reading text, Paul T. Tieger and Barbara Barron-Tieger tell you how to speed read the personalities of those with whom you work and play. This book ably explains the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. With a little practice, you can quickly identify your own personality type and that of anyone you meet. If you are already familiar with the Myers-Briggs model, much of this book will be old news. If you aren't familiar with it, and if you want to learn how to \\"SpeedRead\\" people according to this theory, this book will benefit you. The authors go into great detail about the four temperaments and the sixteen personality types within them. We [...] recommend this as a book for purposeful study.

This book presents the crucial concepts of new marketing. In an age where more than seventy percent of people in the United States earn their living working for service companies, the old product-marketing model is no longer viable. Instead of emphasizing features and benefits, new marketers need to work on developing lasting relationships with their clients. Those who learn this first will be able to attract the largest number of clients, even in a market that is becoming over-saturated with commodities and services. Harry Beckwith's excellent book offers numerous useful tips in a highly readable format. Few chapters are more than a page long, and he offers enough insightful stories and eclectic examples to keep even the most time-pressed reader interested.

This book takes the metaphor, \\"business is war\\" as far is it can possibly go - and then pushes it a little bit farther. The writer, an amateur military historian, draws many examples of strategy and tactics from battlefield applications - none of them Chinese, interestingly enough, considering the inspiration for the book. He establishes indisputably that Sun Tzu's observations in China, circa 400 BC, would have been equally valid in Imperial Rome or World War II. He falters somewhat when he attempts to apply these principles to business. The author struggles to make the connection and occasionally succeeds, most effectively when discussing price wars and hostile takeovers. If the premise that business is like war is questionable, the idea of using a Chinese military handbook as a business text is unusual enough to be stimulating. We [...] recommend this intriguing book to business strategists and managers.	2001-05-07

If you just couldn't get enough of the \\"remake-your-business-from-its-own-ashes\\" wisdom in 1999's Soaring with the Phoenix and the earlier Flight of the Buffalo, you're in luck - the old bird is back. Authors James A. Belasco and Jerre Stead have updated their compilation of prepare-for-the-future and create-your-dream-career lessons. Jam-packed with common sense, insight, vision, and hundreds of examples and anecdotes, the book focuses on familiar themes. While it may not tell you much that you don't already know (or should know), its strength lies in its ability to elbow you in the ribs and remind you. Written in a witty, breezy, sophisticated manner (although distractingly redundant), this pep talk rambles on but is still worth reading for its timely message.

Goodin present a point-counterpoint discussion of the role of government in social welfare programs. This book explains the basic disagreements underlying the social welfare debate. David Schmidtz reasonably presents the conservative argument, but does not address what to do with people who truly cannot contribute to the economy. Goodin stays more clearly on topic, particularly when dismantling arguments for \\"self-reliance,\\" but is less persuasive when he discusses the fate of displaced workers. Schmidtz is willing to accept more people suffering today as the price of progress. However, his argument is weakened by his use of out-dated statistics, which cast a shadow on his other assertions. Goodin prefers to sacrifice some progress to help those who are suffering today. Although neither writer anticipated the recent economic boom, which exposes flaws in both arguments, we [...] still recommend this valuable book as a serious study of social policy.	2001-05-07

He shows you how to use critical thinking skills to find the right problems, frame them correctly and implement appropriate solutions to solve or resolve them.<br />This book is thoughtful and well-organized, just as you might hope it would be since it teaches critical thinking. It is also well-written and well-illustrated, featuring numerous diagrams that illuminate better ways of thinking.

Think of a typical suburb, and you'll conjure images of congested traffic, tacky convenience stores and unattractive strip malls. This development pattern is suburban sprawl. Sprawl strictly segregates offices, homes, shopping centers and schools. Even simple errands require a car. Authors and urban planners Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk decry sprawl as a costly, inefficient and deeply unsatisfying way to live. Heavy traffic in boomtowns like Atlanta, Orlando, and Phoenix demonstrates sprawl's detrimental effects on the quality of life. The alternative is traditional neighborhood development, such as in San Francisco and Boston, where it's possible to walk to stores and take mass transit to work. This cogent, if strident, manifesto against sprawl includes both the ugly truth and the beautiful alternative. We... recommend this book to executives and anyone else interested in the future and well being of the suburban neighborhoods that house their businesses and their families.	2001-05-07

This often-quoted classic still has a lot to say about the service frenzy of today's market, a phenomena that it predicted in its first edition more than fifteen years ago. Karl Albrecht and Ron Zemke have written a powerful, no-nonsense book filled with illustrative examples. If many of their insights seem to be common sense by now, it is only because so many of them have become a part of our collective business unconscious. If this volume was prophetic then (1985), it is indispensable now. We from getAbstract recommend this book to managers and executives throughout the corporate hierarchy.	2001-05-07

Sharon Drew Morgen introduces a new concept in selling, the Buying Facilitation method. Her sales method focuses on understanding people's buying patterns rather than the traditional approach of studying the patterns of successful sellers. This book is one of many highlighting the growing trend toward incorporating ethics and values into the way you conduct business. The book provides how-to advice for sellers who want to make the transition to this new paradigm.<br />To sales people, the most important assertion in the book is Morgen's declaration that `Buying Facilitation' will help close more sales than the traditional approach.

Scholars from around the world provided seven chapter-length overviews of leadership in seven key industries. Editors David C. Mowery and Richard R. Nelson present these detailed, well-documented and richly written explorations in context by offering an analysis in chapters that follow each industry study. The forces that moved these industries in the U.S., Japan and Western Europe included technological innovation, world politics, changing marketing, product innovation and the advent of mass production. We [...] recommend this book to those interested in the progress of the seven industries covered - computers, computer software, semiconductors, machine tools, organic chemical products, pharmaceutical biotechnology and medical devices  - and in global commerce and manufacturing.	2001-05-07

Gilbert Adair, a novelist, biographer, and critic presents a series of eighty essays about the state of culture. He focuses on politics and on the popular and literary arts - cinema, theater, opera, fiction, and visual arts. Though the title might suggest a comprehensive analysis of today's cultural trends, his \\"surfing\\" has nothing to do with the Web. Instead, his overview is highly infused with a British literary and artistic sensibility. These essays are perfect for intellectual, cultural connoisseurs. However, recreational readers may find Adair's numerous references to the early 1990s British cultural scene obscure and remote. Adair discusses some American movies and offers some interesting insights, although his writing is complex, even convoluted. The dense essays are packed with literary asides and personal references. We [...] recommend this book to students of modern culture, arts aficionados of an intellectual or Anglophile bent, and those who read everything about the movies, no matter how challenging.	2001-05-07

Fulmer uses a biological analogy to discuss how organizations form and evolve in an environment that changes through co-evolution with other organizations. Organizations must be ready to learn, and need leaders who can help participants understand change and adapt to it. Though strategic planning can help, Fulmer emphasizes preparing for continual adaptation. His thoughtful, in-depth discussion draws on research from biologists, philosophers and various academic and business writers to create a biological model. He weaves in examples of businesses that have thrived or failed based on their ability or inability to adapt. When Fulmer veers away from his biological analogy, he starts to sound much like many of the other adapt-or-die prophets out there today, but nevertheless, we [...] recommend this solid presentation of a complex subject to executives, top managers and academics.	2001-05-07

Edward de Bono's \\"hats\\" method has been practiced by people in a variety of organizations, from executives in multinational corporations to children in elementary schools. It provides a convenient, easy way to cut through confusion and make decisions based on clear thinking. The hats are useful visualization tools to help sidestep the ego and provide a nonjudgmental path to decision making. Each chapter provides a clear descriptions of a different color hat. The book offers plenty of quotes to suggest how to use the hats in conversation.

Books	4	8	8	N	N	Insightful!	Val and Jeff Gee bring their extensive experience in employee training to a simple, yet effective book version of the training sessions they designed for top corporations. They offer seven critical ideas - keys - to providing outstanding customer service. Each one builds upon the premise and actions of the previous one, making these lessons sensible, precise, and natural to put into practice. The book illustrates each key with anecdotes, case histories, boxed lists, cartoons, and exercises. This creates an interactive learning experience. Nicely written in an upbeat, conversational style, it does not talk down to the reader or take the tone of a cold, authoritarian \\"employee manual.\\" Neither is it condescending by being overly simplified in thought or tone.

Andrew Burstein's book reveals an obscure but important thread in U.S. cultural history. His discussion of the \\"Man of Feeling\\" and the culture of sensibility provides important background for understanding the American Revolutionary period. Since documents such as the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States often are read out of context (if they are read at all), Burstein helps you understand what they meant to their contemporaries. Burstein is almost too thorough in surveying 18th and 19th century literature for examples, and the book is slow going at times. But he also tries to show how these ideas persist in America's self-image. His contemporary analysis is skimpy, though - such as his attempt to explain Hollywood screenwriting conventions in terms of sentimental democracy. However, we [...] recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand some of the subtleties behind the events of early American history.	2001-05-07

Well, if you were, this is how you would invest. Michael F. Lane draws on the advice of top money managers and financial planners to help readers in five key areas: 1) wealth planning, 2) wealth accumulation, 3) wealth without tax, 4) wealth transfer and 5) wealth protection and preservation. The book is aimed at the individual investor with a relative lack of experience in the financial marketplace. The broad overview includes basics of planning your portfolio, E-trading, making investments more tax efficient (for U.S. investors) and estate planning. This solid guide emphasizes fundamentals, although sometimes the discussion becomes repetitious. And, when different advisers give contradictory advice, the diversity of opinion can seem confusing. Lane might have done more summarizing and synthesizing, but we [...] recommend his solid book as a generally good guide for prospective and new investors who want a reason to sing.	2001-05-07

Mayer presents a series of success principles, time management techniques, and networking guidelines for becoming more successful. The book is easy-to-read and targeted to the individual in any type of business. A basic flaw of the book is the lack of originality in both ideas and presentation. Indeed, there are many well-worn platitudes about success and most of the time-management material will sound quite obvious. The workbook-type questions also have a familiar ring. Nonetheless, we [...] recommend the book to managers and executives who want to brush up on their time management skills.	2001-05-07

James A. Belasco and Jerre Stead use the metaphor of the mythological phoenix to underline the need for a leader to embrace change. They suggest using the phoenix to create a new vision for yourself and your company. Their \\"phoenix principles\\" include personal renewal, recognizing your connection with others and promoting their successes, committing to learning and to taking \\"ownership\\" of your life and your company. While the book is easy-to-read, and uses a nifty new metaphor, the ideas are a familiar restatement of Principles of Marketing, Management, and Organizational Behavior 101. We [...] recommend this book to those who haven't taken the basic course lately, or to those whose spirit needs a little old-style renewal dressed in fancy feathers. If you have employees whose focus is flagging, give them a flight on the phoenix.	2001-05-07

Evan Matthew Dudik says businesses do not select their strategies based on scientific thinking, but on anecdotal evidence. This trend has contributed to the explosion of new and changing ideas about what businesses should do. The resulting churn of activity is reflected in the many different approaches that books and consultants advocate. Dudik calls for a return to building and testing theories scientifically, arguing that no one-size-fits-all business strategy exists. Instead, managers should create and test hypotheses to determine an effective approach. Dudik also suggests applying effective warfare strategies and tactics to business. Overall, this is a fairly innovative, refreshing take on developing strategies, although presumably market research is set up to do some of this testing. Paradoxically, Dudik's battlefield analogy seems like one more use of anecdotal evidence to bolster a theory. Generally, however, we[...] recommend this thoughtful, helpful book, noting that its primary strength lies in explaining the use of scientific methodology to test business presumptions.	2001-05-07

It's definitely the most brilliantly written.

Like a 21st century physicist, George Soros is looking for the universal theory, the theory of everything. In Soros on Soros, he tries to express his vision of that theory, that one formula that will link his insights into markets, group dynamics and the historic and political evolution of mankind. While he never succeeds, you'll get a full education in Soros-think as you watch him lurch through a series of anecdotes, observations and philosophic lunges. Soros is an investor and self-proclaimed failed-philosopher, not a wordsmith. The power of this book lies in its ideas, not its art. He has learned from his role as the world's most powerful investor that mere thoughts - whether correct or incorrect - can move markets, motivate people to action and alter the course of history. For that reason, we [...] recommend this book to all investors, executives and students. After a series of financial defeats since 1998, Soros might not be what Soros was, but his ideas and beliefs still sway markets and shade international policy in a manner that few people on the planet can match.	2001-05-07

The best proof of Benjamin Mark Cole's premise - that brokerage houses have sold out common investors to curry favor with huge corporate interests - is the ease with which he accumulates examples of analysts hyping stocks that later went bust. Can the combination of self-interest, analyst hype, and subsequent stock price implosion somehow be coincidental? Or is it time to start calling a duck a duck (or, for that matter, a quack a quack)? Cole's indictment of Wall Street's most efficient salesmen comes just in time for investors looking for a culprit in the overnight evaporation of billions of dollars in retirement funds. Of course, analysts can't be blamed for the stock-market downturn, but their behavior during the run up deserves the close scrutiny it receives here. We [...] recommend this book to any investor who suspects that the true talent of the talking heads they see on CNBC might really be turning your money into theirs.	2001-05-02

Why does technology often fail to deliver promised benefits? The editors of this book propose a novel answer: More often than not, technology failings are not failures in technology at all, but are instead the result of botched interactions among individuals within organizations. Therefore, why not recruit social scientists to analyze information technology problems? That's exactly what the editors did, to our simultaneous benefit and great distress. The benefit: The book whittles down more than 150 published reports into the eight sections presented here. Each section provides an innovative look at the complex relationship between the technological and the social. And now the distress: This is a heavy read, thickly and academically written. We can't recall ever reading a business primer that requires you to have some familiarity with the likes of Foucault and Derrida plus a vague grasp of the Deconstructionist movement. We recommend this book to a selective audience that is curious about groundbreaking academic research in technology, and is up for a serious challenge of comprehension.	2001-05-02

Mike Vance (who worked closely with Walt Disney, one of the world's greatest innovators) and Diane Deacon clearly know their stuff when it comes to raising the bar, thinking outside the box and other somewhat clich&eacute;d approaches to business and personal performance. But, paradoxically, their book fails to raise its own bar. The writing is simplistic, lacks personality and reads like a formulaic presentation absent nuance, wit, intellect or style. Nonetheless, the book's content is worthy of your attention, especially if you're stuck in a rut, fearful of innovating or locked into a corporate climate that discourages creativity. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book's message to those who need a reminder that unless they innovate and ratchet up their achievement level, they will stagnate.

When an author such as entrepreneur Mary Hessler-Key shares her byline with a feline, you know what kind of book you've got. Yes, Hessler-Key has written a cute book, but it does have some sound advice, inspired - she says - by her cats. She noticed that Sheba and Jasper possessed qualities that every entrepreneur could use, and then captured their lessons, which are appealingly illustrated here. Before you write this off as a little ball of fluff, look at the thought-provoking questions that accompany her cat-inspired tips. You can read the book in no time and devote as much effort as you want to the intriguing questions, which will tell you more about yourself than you might think.

Although it was just published in 1998, Customers.com quickly attained the status of an Internet business classic. Of course, that title might be a bit dubious now that the book has outlived many of the companies that tried to put its strategies into practice. But despite your view on the viability of e-businesses, there's no denying the innovation and thoroughness of Patricia B. Seybold's work. Don't be misled by her breezy style; this is an authoritative and informative book. Seybold gets right to the heart of the links between business and technology. Using plenty of examples from major corporations, she suggests eight major strategies for harnessing the power of technology, especially the Internet, to advance your business. Since the book's initial publication, many other authors have espoused these e-tenets, but we [...] advise you to read the original - Seybold probably said it first, and probably said it best.

Barbara A. Gutek and Theresa Welsh believe that companies can improve their relationships with customers if they find the approach that best fits their business. The authors emphasize the difference between real relationships - ongoing, personal contacts between a customer and an individual service provider - and mere encounters - where the customer's relationship is with the company and a random variety of service employees. Many companies confuse the two, trying to turn encounters into relationships, and ending up with pseudo-relationships that alienate customers. Instead, realistically determine what you offer customers and what customers want, and then adjust your systems or policies accordingly. This excellent book provides executives and business owners with an insightful analytical framework for understanding customer relationships. While clear and well organized, it is sometimes repetitious - perhaps to be sure we all get the idea - but we [...] recommend it highly for the soundness of its concepts, if not the economy of its prose.	2001-04-27

Aaker illustrates how such powerful brands connect with customers. Unfortunately, Aaker doesn't show you how to build up your name or how to make the most of your ad dollars. But he does provide compelling, insider case studies, going back to the launch of Procter &amp; Gamble's Ivory soap in 1881. Aaker sets three goals and just about achieves them: 1) Show managers how brand equity provides value, 2) Showcase examples of good and bad marketing and 3) Discuss how to manage brand equity. But, while Aaker explains brand equity by listing its components, the correlation between the parts and the whole is not clear - even with the ever-present flow chart. Regardless, being as well-known as IBM would make you tingle, and if you are looking for interesting historical perspective more than practical managerial advice, we [...] recommend this book, particularly to advertising and marketing executives.	2001-04-27

Although a paranoid, childish and somewhat sniveling Bill Gates is the undoubted antagonist in author Ken Auletta's gripping account of the U.S. government's escalating war against Microsoft, it's tough to find the good guys. By detailing the legal maneuverings of Microsoft's competitors, which in large part spurred the government to action, Auletta pierces some of the innocent-victim personas adopted by the likes of Sun CEO Scott McNealy and others. But the author's treatment of Gates and his Microsoft colleagues is merciless, and in this honest portrait Auletta illustrates how the company's own arrogance brought on its legal woes. News junkies may find the broad outlines of the case familiar, but Auletta uses his readable style to delve into the major personalities and their motivations. We [...] like the way he makes even legal, technological details interesting to the general reader and fascinating to fans of corporate war stories.

Gerstner broke company tradition, fired employees who believed they had a sinecure, slashed a decade-old bureaucracy, and switched IBM's focus from products to solutions.

Given the writing style and the focus on the family and kids, the book seems to be primarily directed toward women who are just starting their businesses or who hold entry-level jobs. Spurge's book will seem too basic to those who were not financially born yesterday. Many of the suggestions will seem obvious or repetitive of other manuals, like career-planning books such as What Color is Your Parachute. However, if you are newly hatched and blinking wide-eyed at the bright world of financial self-sufficiency, we[...] have just the book for you.	2001-04-24

Drew Field wrote this book in 1997 to encourage entrepreneurs to bypass Wall Street and float their shares directly to individual investors. In hindsight, we can see that almost everything that Field predicted in the book was wrong, but it is precisely due to the enormity of his mistakes that this book is relevant in the year 2000. Field's premise was that brokers were ignoring equity issuance and individual investors in favor of big-ticket, M&amp;A-style transactions and institutional deals like securitizations. This shift had created an imbalance in which struggling entrepreneurs were cut off from the capital that they needed to get their businesses off the ground. Of course, what happed in reality was exactly the opposite: A boom in venture capital and the stratospheric rise of the IPO market created an equity bubble of epic proportions, and many start-ups that should never have made it past the garage door raised hundreds of millions of dollars. All of this brings us to the present day, when an IPO backlash has dashed the funding hopes of many public wannabes. To the founders of these companies, we [...] ask: Direct Public Offering, anyone?	2001-04-23

It turns out that when you become savvy about other people, or \\"people smart,\\" you become smarter about yourself, as well. That's the hidden practical message in Mel Silberman and Freda Hansburg's intelligent new book. They bring their considerable expertise and hands-on experience to bear in these lessons on building interpersonal skills. Simply laid out, yet well-written and concise, the book walks you through the sets of skills you need to master.

Communicating effectively is essential in the business world. It is the first step in the path toward leadership. While other business books discuss leadership as a whole, this one focuses in on one of the most basic - and often overlooked - prerequisites to leadership: excellent communication skills. While most of the suggestions presented in Powerful Conversations seem like simple common sense, the book does get you to focus on critical points that you probably take for granted, like building trust, preparing in advance for potentially touchy conversations and actually listening to what other people say. In addition, it offers some helpful conversational strategies and pointers for determining when your meeting is heading south. We [...] recommend this book to executives in leadership positions, who will be reminded to brush up on their conversational style and delivery, and to business people and students looking to talk their way to the top.	2001-04-23

Debra Koontz Traverso presents a compilation of tips telling the entrepreneur or owner of a small business how to compete with established companies as well as other start-ups. Traverso includes a few personal examples, although this is mostly a how-to guidebook. Much of the advice may seem familiar to those who have read similar books or attended small business workshops, but Traverso does manage to throw in a few pointers that make you stop and think. For example: Stand up while you talk on the phone - it will increase your energy level. (Try it: It really works!) In addition, the book offers guidance on creating the right image, partnering with outsiders and family members, making the most out of mundane daily activities and marketing on a limited budget. Top executives may want to skim this to learn how start-ups and small businesses are striving to compete with them, but we [...] recommend this book primarily to entrepreneurs and small business owners who don't want to stay small forever.	2001-04-23

To meet increasingly demanding organizational goals, human resource departments must shift from traditional training methods (i.e. what employees learn) to performance consulting (i.e. what employees must do to achieve those goals). Authors Dana Gaines Robinson and James C. Robinson, who consult in this field, present this intriguing assertion in a rather abstract and wordy book. Thus, this is a better volume for serious study than for casual perusal.<br />The book gives you in-depth research and information on the complicated process of transforming your training operation to performance consulting. The book contains numerous graphs, guides and checklists, as well as a helpful resource section listing Human Resources associations and workshops. We [...] recommend this book to those involved in human resources, particularly training specialists, training coordinators, instructional systems designers, consultants, and career and organizational developers, as well as managers and media specialists.	2001-04-23

Reinventing Yourself is a difficult book to review. Taken as a whole, it fails to deliver, falling into many of the comfortable platitudes (\\"Own the human sprit\\") and meaningless generalities (\\"You can tap into your spirit at any time\\") that plague the self-help universe. But author Steve Chandler manages to surprise you again and again with insightful passages that make you think twice about self-improvement concepts that you've probably glossed over hundreds of times in the past. He does this in part by weaving in contemporary and compelling examples ranging from Janis Joplin concerts (OK, maybe not contemporary) to a Matt Lauer interview with Tiger Woods' father. Quotes from figures as diverse as Thomas Jefferson and Carlos Castaneda also add some heft to what would otherwise seem flimsy assertions. In short, we [...] recommend Reinventing Yourself as a book that manages to rise above its genre, and even, somehow, itself.	2001-04-23

It is filled with flow charts, graphs, and other visuals that will appeal to anyone who wants thorough strategies that can improve training programs.

This book is directed to those who want to unburden and redefine their lives. Authors Richard J. Leider and David A.

They present their suggestions for the metaphorical \\"unpacking and repacking\\" of life's excess \\"baggage\\" in an easy-to-read, sensitive, and even humorous way. Suggestions and exercises encourage you to reexamine what is truly important. Though sometimes redundant, they provide encouraging, thought-provoking material. Reading this book may cause you to have a mid-life crisis \\"on purpose\\" and begin to live like Thoreau, \\"deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life.\\" We [...] recommend this book for those who want to simplify their lives and reassess their priorities.	2001-04-23

If you were designing the curriculum for a class called Introduction to Performance Evaluation, this book would be your text. If, on the other hand, you're in the market for some original ideas and groundbreaking employee-evaluation strategies, this may not be the book for you. Karen McKirchy uses simple language in her guided tour of performance-appraisal basics. If you're an experienced supervisor, you may find the whole thing just a tad too simplistic. But for less seasoned managers, this book is a treasure trove of tips that will make evaluating the performance of your direct reports much more productive, easier and less painfull.

Imagine how effective your marketing would be if you had individual relationships with all of your customers and each had agreed to receive your company's advertising, either because they want the information or because they've been tempted by an incentive. Author Seth Godin makes this connection real, with the help of technology and he says you can do it, too. Godin argues that individualized \\"permission marketing\\" can break through the increasing clutter of traditional advertising, which he dubs \\"interruption marketing.\\" The Internet is ideally suited to building this one-to-one relationship, he says. His engaging book provides a powerful case for this approach to marketing, which begins with getting the customer's consent to receive frequent messages. Godin combines a historical overview and a discussion of advertising's principles with a description of hands-on methods. We [...] recommend his highly accessible book to marketing executives in any industry and especially to managers of Internet-dependent businesses.	2001-04-23

All books that promise to teach you how to manage your time and your tasks more efficiently must be judged by one simple measure: Do they offer techniques that you actually can implement into your life? In the case of Powerful Planning Skills, the answer is an unqualified yes. Although the slim book at first looks simplistic, don't be deceived. Peter Capezio has written a nuts-and-bolts guide that essentially is a straightforward, interactive workbook. The text zeros in on strategic and personal planning styles, while also offering information to help you understand why your past efforts to become the world's best planner might have gone astray. Like most books on time management, this one includes much that you've heard before, but if you're looking to walk away with few new planning tricks, we [...] recommend this book to you.	2001-04-23

Dr. Deborah Bright describes an eight-step program for gaining more control over your life, both every day and in the long term. She discusses becoming more aware of your level of control, and assuming more responsibility for your own direction. She advocates being a \\"pro-achiever,\\" with a positive \\"take control\\" attitude. Although the book's strength resides in stories drawn from personal interviews, the basic principles are very familiar in success and self-help literature. Dr. Bright coins some new phrases, but her advice is not new. However, the self-help audience always seems to welcome a new look at these ideas, restated and repackaged in different ways.

There's more to communications than words, and according to Colleen McKenna you'll have to master a diverse set of self-expression skills if you want to succeed in business. In her book, McKenna covers diverse topics ranging from speaking, writing and listening, to asserting yourself, solving problems and dealing with put-downs. The impressive breadth of the book is also its greatest weakness, in that with so much ground to cover, McKenna is in no position to delve deeply into any one point. As a result, the chapters are lacking in detail. However, each section does provide a wonderful introduction to issues like the problems of communicating with members of the opposite sex and the best ways to prepare for a public speaking engagement. We [...] recommend this book to professionals interested in getting a well-rounded sample of several communications disciplines before plunging into more in-depth research.	2001-04-23

While some of his more than 80 \\"Mobius rules\\" for investing may seem simplistic and clich&eacute;d, Mobius backs up his snappy, one-sentence rules with coherent instructions. The book has a friendly, conversational tone. His adventures visiting less-developed countries where he wants to invest are richly detailed. They offer a real glimpse into how business is conducted in markets such as Russia, Brazil, and Hong Kong.

Over the last decade we have seen many self-serving autobiographies and memoirs, but Henry Kaufman's On Money and Markets certainly is not one of them. Kaufman is an investment banker, but he is also a scholar and a gentleman. These memoirs capture the mettle of the man from his start in the banking business, through his years at Salomon Brothers and eventually to his own consulting business. The period covered, from pre-world War II to the end of the 20th century, is the most dynamic time in the history of the financial markets. It is Kaufman's insights into these revolutionary years on Wall Street that make this a gripping tale.

From Galileo to the Wright Brothers, mankind's most significant scientific discoveries have come from thinkers who challenged the assumptions of the day, often earning the scorn - or worse - of their contemporaries. Esteemed futurist Willis Harman reminds us of this fact early and often in the second edition of Global Mind Change, which is enhanced by a foreword by acclaimed author, Hazel Henderson, but otherwise maintains the original's insights and flaws. In terms of insight, Harman speaks eloquently about the changes in human perspective that accompanied - and he says ultimately caused - such radical shifts as the fall of the Roman Empire and the demise of slavery in the United States. He extends this analysis to modern scientific thought, which he identifies as a societal foundation currently in the first stages of a paradigm shift in which many concepts now viewed as \\"New Age\\" will gain acceptance. We [...] recommend this book to any armchair futurist, but urge all readers to bear in mind one caveat: For every free thinker who upended science with brilliant insight, there have been untold thousands of quacks, madmen and charlatans.	2001-04-20

Victor Gotbaum relates his personal experiences as a negotiator for New York City's District Council 37 union to demonstrate how negotiating strategies are developed on the fly according to each unique situation. Gotbaum dismisses books that offer a single, set-in-stone formula for handling negotiations. Every negotiation is different and requires an understanding of its precise situation. This book shows negotiators how to prepare by examining specific factors that are critical to every negotiation. Gotbaum illustrates his points with personal examples, sometimes to the degree that portions of the book read like a listing of his victories rather than as advice. Novice negotiators will find valuable assistance in this book, but it is better suited for negotiators with more experience.

Author Michael Emerson - a former European Union (EU) Ambassador to Moscow and European Commission official - has created a concise, systematic analysis of the cultural background, policy issues and the political-science frameworks surrounding the emerging organization of a 21st-century Europe. This is not a book for the casual observer of European politics - but anyone with a sincere curiosity about the nuts-and-bolts construction of the integrated Europe will be fully sated. The book has the advantages and disadvantages of being densely packed with details, but the strong introduction, conclusion and index help the reader put it all together. Although the publication date - 1998 - ensures that some of this information is dated, the book might actually benefit from its pre-euro publication, in that Emerson's arguments give full optimistic credit to the potential of a unified Europe.

The writing is disjointed and unclear, severely handicapping the reader's ability to discern much of what the authors are trying to convey.

Josh Gordon clearly and effectively presents 20 different classic, difficult behaviors, including everything from \\"The Client Who Lies to You\\" to \\"The Client Who Knows It All.\\" Gordon offers useful strategies for dealing with such personalities and situations, strategies that can help you make your sale and then make a clean getaway.

If you plan to use Nobody's Business But Your Own as a reference guide to starting your own business, stop now. Don't stop reading the book, but stop whatever plans you have about setting out on your own. Enroll in some classes. Talk with an entrepreneur or two. But to rely on this book for advice would mean falling back on lessons that most people should have absorbed simply from living to adulthood. This is not to say that the book doesn't offer general pointers about starting a business - it does. But even the least business-savvy readers will find the guidelines presented here much too simplistic to serve as any foundation for business strategy creation. However, if you enjoy hearing the real-life stories of successful entrepreneurs, by all means read this book. The true-life anecdotes that close each chapter are colorful and entertaining, and we [...] recommend this book to anyone interested in reading well-written tales of entrepreneurial accomplishment.	2001-04-19

Bill Lessard and Steve Baldwin's engaging and ironic book discusses the lives lead by workers in the Internet economy. The fictitious accounts introduce people toiling at all levels of employment in the Internet economy. The picture isn't pretty. Because it is driven by intense greed, the Internet economy is hard - if not downright brutish - on its employees. You cannot understand why employees work under these conditions, but clearly these circumstances are designed to exploit a bubble in the capitalistic structure. Executives and managers may not like the clear anti-management tone of this book, but may still find it a worthwhile read. Employees, of course, will love this book. We [...] recommend it to anyone who wants a different perspective on the Internet economy.	2001-04-19

In the pages of their new book, Ellen Schwartz and Suzanne Stoddard relate this quote from Paul Hawken's, The Ecology of Commerce: \\"There is no polite way to say that business is destroying the world.\\" While Hawken was talking specifically about the physical Earth, Schwartz and Stoddard are not so limited in their condemnation. Business is destroying the world and everything in it: democracy, living wages, healthcare, the nutritional value of food and even our sanity. We'll put it simply: If you agree with that mindset, you'll love this book. If you have any doubts that corporations constitute an evil empire, you won't. Nevertheless, we [...] recommend that dedicated professionals read this double-barreled critique of the corporate world, just to know how the other side sees you.	2001-04-19

Amir Hartman and John Sifonis present a series of principles and techniques to help you compete in the age of E-commerce. This levelheaded book is directed toward CEOs and top executives who are serious about conducting Internet business. The authors emphasize the four pillars of net readiness: leadership, governance, competencies and technology. They tell you how to strategize through deft administration, using the proper controls, knowledge and technical skills. The book presents examples of companies that have succeeded in E-business, as well as those that have failed. The lists, charts and questions will help you determine your own net-readiness. While the book emphasizes the need for speed, it avoids the quick, \\"single-fix approach\\" of other Internet books. We [...] recommend this solid manual to E-entrepreneurs.	2001-04-19

John MacArthur, editor of Harper's Magazine, is a persistent, resourceful, and thorough reporter with an unapologetic opinion about the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). MacArthur makes no attempt to disguise his disdain for the trade pact, which he describes as a measure designed to institutionalize U.S. exploitation of Mexican workers, or for the politicians, businessmen and lobbyists who supported it. In researching this book, MacArthur interviewed many of the key national and international players who helped create NAFTA and found rare interviews with others. He illustrates the debate by presenting an analysis of NAFTA's impact on workers at a U.S factory, and on the Mexicans who replace them. Ironically, he paints such an effective portrait of the inner workings of the Mexican maquiladoras factories that U.S. business leaders reading this book might be further enticed to relocate. The finest feature of the book is its exhaustive treatment of the law-making process, and its lucid judgment of the Washington establishment. We [...] recommend this book to students of politics or international trade, business leaders interested in gaining insight into the anti-globalization movement, and to anyone trying to get a bill passed in the U.S. Congress.	2001-04-19

The outlook for selling as a career has darkened with the spread of automated and electronic transactions and product sales. How, then, can the modern salesperson succeed? By embracing a consultative sales approach, a salesperson can build one-to-one relationships with clients and become their expert resource for product information. Starting from shine-your-shoes-and-tuck-in-your-shirt basics, consultants Jeffrey Gitomer and Ron Zemke present a highly readable, detailed plan for managing every aspect of the transition from transactional to relationship-based selling. Beginning salespeople can use this book as a how-to guide for developing their careers, while seasoned professionals will gain from its straightforward instructions for developing a portfolio of long-term customers. Managers will relish the tools for cataloguing and improving their sales force's skills. For these reasons, we... recommend this book for sales professionals at every level.	2001-04-19

This first-rate study of the workings of the brain is required reading for anyone interested in how advertisers influence consumers, how mental exercise can improve both mental and physical performance or how parents can stimulate mental activity in their young children. That probably doesn't leave out many curious readers. Starting with a basic explanation of how the brain initially forms, Ian H. Robertson logically proceeds into his explanation of mind sculpting, which is nothing less than the process through which the mind is continuously evolving. His treatment of the staggeringly complex topic is surprisingly accessible, enabling you to make the intuitive leaps from biological detail to the practical manifestations of these phenomena without handholding. In short, we [...] recommend that you read this book.	2001-04-17

Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \\"I Have A Dream\\" speech was voted the most electrifying public address of the twentieth century. It takes some kind of a leader to give that kind of a speech. Donald T. Phillips presents the ideals of leadership that Martin Luther King Jr. followed in an overview of the history of the civil rights struggle. Phillips describes the techniques King used at various stages of the civil rights battle. He also shares King's comments on leadership. Many of the principles will be quite familiar: listen to learn, lead by being led, awaken direct action, encourage creativity and involve the people. However, the book is especially interesting when it demonstrates how King put these principles into practice. This well-organized, well-written book is clear, direct, and easy to read. While it is written for the general public (especially for African-Americans and those interested in civil rights), we [...] find this book interesting for all managers and executives, particularly those who like to learn the lessons of history.	2001-04-17

Mark Albion addresses \\"successful\\" businesspeople who feel as if their personal lives are not successful. He believes life is too short to work at something that has no value to you. He presents real stories from his own life and the lives of others interspersed with uplifting quotes from philosophers, poets, and celebrities. While the stories make for interesting reading, this book might be a little too \\"warm and fuzzy\\" for some readers. Albion paints a perfect world where all people work at jobs they enjoy, but he doesn't spend enough time addressing the real difficulties involved in making a major life change. The shortage of specific instruction makes this book more valuable as a tool for inspiration than as a \\"step-by-step\\" guide to changing your lifestyle. We from getAbstract recommend this book for people who are unhappy with their current jobs and considering making a career change.	2001-04-17

Why do people work hard and try to perform well? Salary, status and security are the tangible pay-offs, but the core motivators that drive people to earn these rewards are less easily identified. Author Thad Green offers several simple but practical methods to inspire employees that go beyond the standard rhetoric perfected by other motivational authors. The upshot: Employees are not motivated by what you tell them will happen, but by what they believe will actually happen. This is a subtle point that's often lost in build-trust-through-communication manuals. Using well-organized examples, anecdotes and charts, Green tells you how to cement the connection between positive performance and predictable rewards in the minds of your employees. The section offering questions that you can ask employees to unveil the source of discontent and poor performance will be an invaluable tool for any manager. Of course, some suggestions in this hands-on treatment may seem obvious (such as asking employees what they want, so you can select the motivators that will satisfy them). But otherwise, we [...] recommend this solid book on a subject at the heart of many employer-employee relationships.	2001-04-17

Managing By Values uses the same simple, direct story format used in The One Minute Manager and many other Ken Blanchard books. This makes the book easy to follow as it moves from one concept to the next. This book does a good job of presenting the Managing By Values system as an idea that makes sense for a company's bottom line. It's great to have a work force that enjoys their jobs, but those jobs won't last long if a company doesn't remain profitable. Managing By Values shows that you don't have to sacrifice profit to increase worker satisfaction and that you don't have to sacrifice worker satisfaction to increase profit. The MBV process shows that increased worker satisfaction leads to increased profit. This book is written for CEOs and people in senior leadership positions.	2001-04-17

Phillips has written a solid and engaging book. It has been hailed by critics and leaders in business, sports, and every other arena as a common sense masterpiece of historical and character analysis. The book is divided into key lessons, each representing an aspect of President Abraham Lincoln's leadership style, as revealed through his words and actions. A beautifully written intimate history, the book shows Lincoln in action. The discussion reveals clearly how any leader can apply Lincoln's timeless principles about communication, character, endeavor, and people.

This book is a delightful result of Frederick Newell's recent indoctrination in marketing through the World Wide Web. Newell is an internationally acclaimed professional and part-time academic who specializes in database marketing. He admits in his preface that he's a bit of a \\"geezer\\" - because his 1997 book, The New Rules of Marketing, lacked a Web component, which undermined its newness. In an effort to rectify that, he reconciles the impressive database-mining and customer relationship concepts from his earlier book with today's rapidly changing cyber-marketing theories and practices. Newell clearly is excited by what he has belatedly learned about the Web's potential, and provides on-target case studies to support his points. We [...] recommend this book to all marketers - especially to those in retail. Those who are new to Web business will find it particularly useful.	2001-04-17

The authors show you how to guide your business through the present while simultaneously preparing for and implementing changes for the future. This well-balanced book, which focuses as much on vision, intuitive processes and thinking as it does on nuts-and-bolts strategy, is a valuable guide for working and leading in the twenty-first century.

Instead of launching into long-winded sermons about discovering your \\"true\\" identity, author Jim Cairo poses a few simple questions that set the reader off on an interesting path of introspection. By forcing you to get involved with the book by answering these questions yourself, Cairo is using the principles that he writes about.  The exercises he suggests will start building momentum that you can carry right over into your own personal goals. The book falters only in the sections on motivation and change, where Cairo lapses into generic sloganeering about learning from mistakes and embracing change. Regardless, we [...] recommend this book to anyone who feels that they could use a second wind, from a high-school student struggling to remain motivated, to a 55-year-old CEO looking for fresh challenges.	2001-04-17

Al Ries and Jack Trout's book marches to a military drumbeat, as you might guess from the dedication to Karl von Clausewitz, \\"one of the greatest marketing strategists the world has ever known.\\" Advice abounds for the testosterone-impaired, including football references and quotations from Gen. Patton. It offers an incisive, if militaristic, strategic marketing perspective. At one point the authors feel the need to clarify: \\"We don't mean [to advise] undermining leaders by dynamiting their plants or interdicting their rail centers. That's a physical way of looking at marketing warfare.\\" This book proves that the \\"us-against-them\\" mindset thrives, even in this era of joint ventures. If you believe Bill Gates succeeded because he was a nice young man, this book probably isn't for you. Otherwise, snap to attention, soldier, for a few lessons in the art of marketing warfare.

Two young bankers have written a revealing book about investment banking. John Rolfe and Peter Troob, both graduates of top ranked universities and business schools, joined Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette (DLJ) in the1990s. They were drawn to DLJ by the opportunity to make a great deal of money. They earn and tell, with lively stories from the thirty months or so that they spent plying their trade. These stories are presented as representative of the entire investment banking industry. The writers' in-the-trenches anecdotes make the book entertaining and valuable.

Nicholas' thorough breakdown of market-neutral investing reveals some common threads and some striking differences between the most common strategies. Most of these strategies, some of which are based on newly developed financial instruments, are not available to average investors or even to many mutual fund managers. Instead, they serve as tools for money managers at the world's largest institutions. Nicholas uses mostly non-technical language and defines all important terms in a glossary, so that even a lay reader can understand. He also keeps math to a minimum. As a result, his book makes the seemingly dry realm of hedge fund investment techniques interesting and accessible while delving deeply into each strategy's approach to risk and reward. We [...] recommend this book to money managers, finance professionals and investors considering a hedge fund investment. But in light of the role that these strategies played in the collapse of former world-beater, Long-Term Capital Management, any student or professional would benefit from gaining at least a cursory notion of how they work - or don't work.	2001-04-17

Norman Flynn summarizes many arguments and viewpoints about Asia's 1997-1998 financial crisis. Flynn, who thoroughly documents his information with examples, charts and graphs, lays out the key pre-crisis weaknesses in the Asian economies. Then, he examines ways that \\"expressive\\" personal relationships, especially among the &eacute;lites, define much of Asia's economic and political activity. He examines shifts in society, as globalization and supranational institutions (read IMF) move power from governments and &eacute;lites to the markets. Flynn leans away from drawing conclusions - he prefers to present various points of view - but when he does state a conclusive opinion, he is persuasive. The book is packed with useful information, despite being short, very dense, and rather academic. We [...] recommend this excellent book to anyone with a serious interest in investing or doing business in Asia.	2001-04-17

In any corporate culture, the goal is paradoxical: you want to fit in and stand out, at the same time. Based on her experience in working with business leaders as a coach, trainer, and consultant, Benton offers a variety of techniques that emphasize personal presentation and communication skills. While the book will appeal primarily to managers, these skills are useful to anyone who wants to get ahead. Benton combines a lively writing style with effective examples. The book includes useful summaries at the end of each chapter and a brief appendix.

The authors express their dissatisfaction with the results of reforms in the last decade. This is an important book for individuals who want another perspective on the rush to implement western financial policies globally.

Many mergers, acquisitions and alliances fail due to lack of preparation before, lack of care during, or lack of focus after the deal. Joining Forces is a sober, to-the-point manual directed at business leaders who want to provoke successful combinations, as well as managers and employees who have to deal with the burdens, both mental and physical, of combinations. For the past decade, corporate America has embraced M&amp;A - often with mixed results - and the consolidation pace seems to be accelerating. But too few people inside and outside of the companies involved understand what the combination process means or how it should be handled. Organizations must be willing to focus on the psychological impacts of a combination on their employees. Joining Forces provides a rough sketch of how this can be accomplished - minus any unnecessary strategic details or legalese. We [...] recommend this book to executives, managers and employees at every level - all of whom probably will have to face the realities of corporate consolidation some day.	2001-04-16

Wheatley explains the need to get rid of our old out-dated mechanistic models and adapt our organizations to prosper in the future. Our accepted analytical world view, based on using logical analysis and relying numbers to chart progress, should be replaced, Wheatley says. She makes a compelling case and urges organizations to become more effective by becoming more human and natural. We [...] recommend this pivotal book to leaders at all levels.	2001-04-16

He emphasizes the need to truly empower and support workers. He underscores the importance of making the team adaptable to the work itself, rather than clinging to a particular structure. Fisher combines principles with examples and how-to tips that you can apply in your own organization. He provides good summaries of each chapter's highlights. We [...] recommend this well-organized, clearly written book. While some of its contents are similar to recent books on creating teams, empowering employees and using a better management style, it is an excellent recap and a good guide for anyone new to team-building methods.	2001-04-16

Finally, a book that honestly identifies and analyzes that prolific workplace species - the jerk. Organized by situation and topic, Jerks at Work presents the answers to at least 200 jerk-related questions from real-life readers that were originally published in author Ken Lloyd's syndicated On the Job column. The book is psychologically sound, excruciatingly direct, extremely funny and, above all, actually helpful. Lloyd does a splendid job of covering all the bases and every kind of jerk, from the boardroom to the mailroom. We [...] highly recommend this book to everyone, because every company has at least one jerk.	2001-04-16

Pearl shows you how to give your children financial roots and wings. By roots, she means good financial information, values, and ethics. By wings, she means encouraging kids to be confident, independent financial managers. While Jayne Pearl's information is thorough, some of it is specific to U.S. taxation laws and economic structures, which makes the book less useful to an international audience. We... recommend this book to parents who are concerned about their children's financial well being, and to those who need a refresher on good spending habits.	2001-04-16

In this day of extreme sports and extreme fashions, Philip R. Nulman introduces you to extreme customer service, and it is every bit as exciting as ski jumping, but without the danger. With many lively and inspiring examples - all of them useful, not just present to take up space - Nulman uses his insight and expertise to show how extreme service and the \\"no problem\\" philosophy can win customers and keep them. His entertaining book cites cases from many industries, and offers plenty of practical, usable strategies.

Diana Rowland has written the classic guide to Japanese business etiquette and to the impact of Japanese culture on business and social interaction. Extremely thorough and fascinating, this guide covers all the traditions you need to understand to do business with the Japanese, in Japan or around the world. A good read even if you are just culturally curious, the book includes Japanese office layouts, diagrams showing where business guests should sit around the dinner table, and information on interpreting gestures at business meetings. Rowland covers the business and social roles of women and the difference between the real truth and the public truth. The book's final 50 pages provide a wide range of helpful, general resources, including important phone numbers and a glossary. We from getAbstract recommend this book to anyone doing business with the Japanese, anyone who plans to visit Japan for business or pleasure, and anyone who's just curious.	2001-04-16

The death of the New Economy has been greatly exaggerated. That's the message at the heart of Sandra Vandermerwe's new book. While the heady valuations of the late `90s are history, the fundamental changes that technology inspired during that time are here to stay. With that in mind, Vandermerwe presents analyses of tools that business leaders need to survive into the 21st century. The most insightful of these is a breakdown of customer feedback loops and how they can be harnessed to lock in business. The book can't avoid many of the shortcomings that pervade most New Economy literature, like the tendency to advise readers to remake their businesses in anticipation of future customer needs - without commenting on how exactly that can be achieved. Nevertheless, if you're a manager who suspects that the innovations of the last decade might still play a key role in the growth of business, we [...] recommend this book to you.	2001-04-16

Members of the Arbinger Institute have written an important book that has the potential to change the way you think, behave, and live your life, both personally and professionally. This book simply and effectively addresses a core problem in human nature: self-deception. Presented as a series of conversations between two businessmen, one acting as a mentor to the other, the book walks you through the kinds of events that put you \\"in the box\\" of self-deception. Then, the book explains how you can get out of the box and, just as importantly, explains how to avoid getting stuck in the box in the first place. The authors believe that self-deception is at the root of all conflict and lack of productivity. For that reason, we at ... recommend this book to all who are concerned about human motivation.	2001-04-16

Thomas presents a model for using intrinsic motivation in the workplace to assure a more committed, self-managed workforce. He advocates leading for meaningfulness, choice, competence, and progress. He emphasizes the need to use this approach to give employees the greater independence and decision-making authority they need as bureaucratic management models break down. While many of these themes are presented in other books on leadership, motivation, training and worker empowerment, Thomas pulls them together in a well-organized, clearly written presentation that gives readers clear directions. The succinct style of writing is easy to understand, even though it is directed toward the serious reader. We [...] recommend this book to executives, managers, trainers and management consultants, as well as to employees, who will find helpful ideas for exercising greater self-management.	2001-04-16

Robert Slater's book is an inside account of General Electric's history since Jack Welch became Chief Executive Officer in 1981. Under Welch's direction, GE made great strides in the economic community, both domestically and internationally. Welch is considered to be the toughest boss and the most admired manager in the United States.<br />Although this is a company biography, it also contains hands-on advice that will serve any company well. It teaches companies how to restructure and how to make their employees more enthusiastic. It offers advice on how to change management and gives many examples of specific ways to help a business become a leader in its field. This well-written, well-organized book is easy to read and very entertaining. Chief Executive Officers who want to take their companies to a higher level should study it. Today's business leaders can learn a lot from the lessons of Jack Welch. We [...] recommend this book to all managers.	2001-04-16

Authors Richard L. Hughes, Robert C. Ginnett, and Gordon J. Curphy explore every aspect of leadership and smoothly weave research conclusions into the narrative. Examples abound, from Colin Powell to Walt Disney. The authors are all psychologists who specialize in leadership issues. They have written conversationally and intelligently, using plenty of sidebar material (even famous cartoons) to bring their reporting to life.

Wess Roberts draws on the life experiences of the leader of the Mongol hordes to craft imaginative monologues on leadership - an attribute as valuable today as when Attila united the Huns in 415 AD. The advice is general. Its effectiveness probably depends on how well you apply it, although the idea of an historic icon of barbaric vengeance counseling us in cultural sensitivity seems a bit of a stretch. While the treatment is certainly colorful, you might worry about ways some modern-day chieftains could misuse Roberts' principles to justify their own Visigoth approach to management. We [...] recommend this book to those looking for new and interesting ways to approach the perpetual management issues of team-building, inspiring loyalty, setting goals, and achieving objectives.	2001-04-16

Barry Oshry maintains that we all live in systems that inevitably shape our understanding of the world and our relationship to it. If you haven't noticed a system encircling you, look again at your socioeconomic group, which governs you in far more ways than you suspect. To teach power, leadership, and systems, Oshry runs an experiential program in which participants totally immerse themselves in an \\"assigned\\" system, usually by living and working in a particular socioeconomic realm (as in \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\\" or a pauper). He has taught this \\"Power Lab\\" for thirty years. In this book, Oshry looks at human systems and at lessons from the Power Lab experiences. His insights are casually written, but well crafted. We [...] recommend this fascinating, insightful book to anyone interested in power, leadership, human systems, and sociology.	2001-04-16

This book falls squarely into the apocalyptic tradition of business literature. It preaches the end of the world, and exhorts readers to repent and prepare for a new world unlike anything they have known. Burton-Jones has absorbed, organized and presented a mass of data to support his message. The data themselves are worth the price of the book, because they provide ample raw material from which to draw one's own conclusions about the validity of the author's thesis. He has trademarked certain key phrases in the book, and the frequent appearance of the superscript \\"TM\\" is a helpful reminder to the reader to remember that this book is at least in part a sales pitch for a consultancy practice. But it is nonetheless important to read this book because while Burton-Jones may be wrong about some things, he is clearly right that a big global economic change is underway, and he sets forth in clear, if colorless, prose a reasonably plausible explanation of what it is and why it is happening. We [...] recommend the book to owners, managers, individuals, students, teachers, and policy-makers.	2001-04-16

Stayer have written an insightful book, the title of which derives from the authors&#8217; vision of traditional companies as a milling buffalo herds. The book&#8217;s central metaphor follows from this vision &#8212; Modern leaders must transform their companies from buffalo herds to flocks of geese, in which each bird takes a turn at the head of the V. Their straightforward prose is peppered with real-world examples, and Belasco and Stayer display a refreshing willingness to reveal their own past leadership shortcomings in explaining the concepts that they propose. Many of these concepts boil down to a simple, and hardly original axiom: Empower your employees. But by presenting these ideas in a down-to-earth style that&#8217;s illustrated by entertaining anecdotes, the book brings life to advice that otherwise might seem clich&eacute;. We recommend this book to professionals new to management, and to more experienced executives looking for an accessible introduction to the rationale, theory and practice of employee empowerment.	2001-04-13

This visually stunning, insightful and clever book was published to coincide with a major exhibition of the same name at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England. The exhibit's curator, Jane Pavitt, is also the book's editor. She has selected essays on branding and its impact on consumers and culture that take a challenging look at the phenomenon of international consumerism and how it came to be. Because of the wonderful illustrations, including photos of products, advertisements and retail outlets spanning the entire 20th century, this richly detailed book has an impact second only to seeing the exhibition in person. So we [...] say buy a ticket to Great Britain, or read this informative, well-written and often irreverent set of essays by critics, historians, scholars, designers and business experts. If seeing is believing, this innovative exhibit packed between hard covers is an innovative way to see - and truly understand - the power of branding.	2001-04-12

Emanuel Rosen discovered the power of buzz as marketing VP for Niles Software when it produced EndNote, a research tool for tracking references and compiling bibliographies. Niles received its first EndNote order from someone in New Jersey who heard about it before it was advertised, when only a few people knew it existed. EndNote sold more than 200,000 copies, but most customers heard about it from friends or colleagues, not from ads or retailers. Rosen describes how this word of mouth develops and how you can create favorable buzz for your product. He emphasizes the role of multiple personal networks in creating buzz. Then, he describes the need to reach network hubs - individuals at the center of these networks - to create everyday grassroots buzz as part of your marketing mix. The lively style of this authoritative book makes it engaging. We at ... presume that it will generate extremely positive buzz throughout many different networks.	2001-04-12

If you're the type of reader who loves to devour an entire book on a rainy day, you'd better wait for a Noah-size deluge before tackling Minds, Machines, and the Multiverse. Wet or dry, you will marvel at author Julian Brown's encyclopedic knowledge. He uses charts, graphs and the occasional equation to try to make the inscrutable plain. However, unless reversibility, the Fredkin Gate and the von Neumann machine mean something to you, the essence of Brown's narrative may elude you, beyond rough translation. He explains the possibility that the notion of alternative universes can be used to create a quantum computer that would be far more powerful than any computer heretofore. Brown persistently reveals possibilities that seem like dreams. We [...] recommend his book to those who strive for news heights of techie theory or who think of physics as a hobby. Though fascinating, it may leave mere mortals feeling uncertain and somewhat overwhelmed.	2001-04-12

Sport is an overused metaphor for business, but Ron Wolf, Executive Vice President and General Manager of the U.S. National Football League's Green Bay Packers, surpasses the majority of management experts with his common-sense organizational wisdom. Recounting his turnaround of a languishing football franchise into a Super Bowl winner, Wolf (along with co-author Paul Attner) shows how he used the very principals he illustrates with his compelling sports analogies. While your organization may not compete on a stage as public as the NFL, you can use the same strategies. If these tactics can help the small-market Packers compete with teams from Chicago, New York and Los Angeles, they can certainly help your firm compete as well. We [...] especially recommend Wolf's \\"stepping stone\\" strategy of incremental improvement, which seems to us the equivalent of building a solid running game while your opponents lob Hail Marys.	2001-04-12

Before you open your mouth again, open this book. Author Richard Dowis issues a call to oratory greatness in the form of a personal memoir and a professional manual. Citing great contemporary and historical speeches, the book exemplifies some of Dowis' best advice and is more comprehensive than the title indicates. It is a communications guide, ranging from workaday necessities, such as correct word usage, to the \\"secrets of the pros,\\" incorporating ideas from acknowledged masters. Writing and delivering outstanding speeches is still a pathway to advancement, because good speechwriters and speakers are always in short supply, but this advice reaches beyond speeches and applies to every form of written and oral communication.

If you're looking for someone to tell you to quit that hum-drum job and go find your true self, look elsewhere. William and Rosemary Salmon have written a book for the moderately alienated masses who have lost their enthusiasm for a job that once sparked their imaginations. Like a tune-up for your car, routine career maintenance can improve your performance. The tools the authors use are communication, relationships and continuous self-improvement. While these habits certainly are worthy, they are not particularly groundbreaking. Readers hoping for a complete career-engine overhaul won't find it here. But if what you need is some routine servicing to get the cylinders firing again, we at ... recommend this book to you.	2001-04-12

Shortly after a briefing by author Robert Shiller, Alan Greenspan warned the country about the \\"irrational exuberance\\" pushing stock prices excessively high. The year was 1996 and, in hindsight, it's clear that the bull was just beginning to run. Anyone who heeded that warning would have passed up some of history's most impressive gains. Yet, if history is any guide, stock prices could be in for a 10 or 20 year decline, falling back below the bull market's gains.  But Shiller isn't teaching market timing; he's debunking some cherished investing axioms, such as, the belief that stocks are the best long-term investment. He discredits financial reportage, limns to the psychological and emotional factors that make markets behave irrationally and proves that nothing is new about \\"new economy\\" prattle. The book is a very effective vaccination against the costly virus of credulity. We [...] suggest this book for every investor's shelf - dog-eared and worn from frequent re-reading.	2001-04-11

Charles Merrill is an authentic American genius and today's capital markets bear his distinctive stamp in many ways, as Edwin J. Perkins' book proves in fascinating detail. While the book works as a business history and as a professional portrait, it is less successful as a biography because Perkins deliberately chose to focus on Merrill's professional life. By keeping Merrill's personal life very much in the background, Perkins declines to bring Merrill's personality to life. We learn about his career, but we do not seem to get to know the man himself. Happily, Merrill's achievements and business innovations are well worth examining. His commitment to service, integrity and the good of the common customer - even when that angered the elite customer - made him richer than most of the aristocrats who fought against him. We [...] recommend this worthy portrayal of a riveting role model to entrepreneurs, finance professionals and any business history buff.	2001-04-11

If you're just beginning your career or if you're stalled and wondering why you're not progressing up the ladder, you will find David E. Rye's basic book quite useful. His credo: Use self-promotion to attain professional promotion. Don't be misled by the gimmicky title. This is not a list of 1,00l ways to land that promotion. Instead, Rye builds his book around seven strategies that let everyone know you are management material. We [...] like one thing in particular - at pivotal points in each chapter, Rye recommends books that will take you further into the particular subject that chapter covers. This is a great idea, and more business books should refer onward this way.

Scott's short, scholarly book makes a compelling case for the future growth of regional economies and explains the key role they are likely to play in shaping future global political and economic development. Though written in dense, academic language, the book makes its points clearly and supports them with research, theory and statistics. Scott's guidelines for `regional directorates' reflect many experiments that are already under way around the world, and seeks to capture the best features of each. If his basic idea is correct, then a conscious effort to build regional institutions should speed economic development and reduce world economic stresses. This book is heavy reading, but it is concise and to the point. We [...] recommend it to executives in multinational corporations, entrepreneurs thinking about where to locate, urban planners, civic leaders and government officials - in short, anyone who wants to promote or profit from regional economic development.	2001-04-11

She's an intelligent, competent and well-intentioned person, so she can't figure out why Marty, her terminally put-upon employee resents her, why her husband Bill ignores her, or why conversations with her teenage son Todd always turn into shouting matches. Through a series of enlightening interactions, Gloria shows readers how seemingly hopeless relationships can be resurrected when communications improve. Author Ray DiZazzo uses hypothetical examples to illustrate his tips for clear communications. His narrative won't win any literary awards, but it is surprisingly effective at teaching readers how to communicate better. We [...] recommend his book to all managers, because your job hinges in large part on communicating effectively. Now is that perfectly clear?	2001-04-11

This simple but effective book is written for a general audience with interest in managerial, supervisory and leadership concepts. The book is structured as a dictionary of terms relating to leadership. While some readers may like the A-B-C division of information, others may find the book somewhat disjointed, as the format forces you to skip around from idea to idea. But then, as author James O'Toole points out, readers are invited to seek the nuggets that appeal to them, letter by letter. The connective tissue that O'Toole lays between the entries is ambition, which he says is the single pre-requisite to leadership and the one common characteristic that all great leaders share. We [...] recommend this accessible summary of basic leadership principles, although hardcore readers of leadership literature might be better off elsewhere.	2001-04-11

How can citizens of a society that exalts freedom consent to spend the majority of their lives laboring within organizations that are hierarchical, slow-moving and dictatorial? Gifford and Elizabeth Pinchot raised that question in their heralded 1993 book and provided the following answer: Not willingly and not for long. The Pinchots were among the first management scholars to predict the demise of the military-style command structure, along with its inherent secrecy and Machiavellian political sniping. Although a slew of books devoted to the same theme have been published since, none have done a better job at explaining the potential of informed and engaged employees who don't fear their bosses too much to take decisive action. We [...] strongly recommend this book, which brims with meticulous case histories showing how teams, employee-owned companies and internal free-market competition have transformed organizations. (In fact, the Pinchots coined the term \\"intraprenuership\\" to describe this process.)  While you might not be convinced that a company run by consensus can ever compete with one run by The Prince, this book gives you hope that it can.	2001-04-11

Friedman and Jeffrey H. Greenhaus conducted extensive research with 861 alumni of the business schools at Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania, both in Philadelphia. Their research yielded revealing results about the struggle of professionals to manage work and family commitments. However, Friedman and Greenhaus present these results in such overwhelming statistical detail that the average reader is in danger of being swamped. This is especially the case when the data proves principals that most people already grasp through common sense and experience. That said, we ... recognize that the authors have done working Joes and Janes a great service by aggregating numbers to back up the notion that it's getting tougher to balance family and career. As such, this is an important book for anyone in a position to set workplace policy.	2001-04-10

Gifford Pinchot and Ron Pellman describe a hands-on plan of action for moving from an idea's creation to its implementation in a company setting. They focus on the support an idea needs from an intrapreneur, who runs with the idea, whether he/she originated it or not. This individual is much like an executive producer who shepherds a film through the stages of development necessary for production. These stages include developing an intrapreneurial team to work on the project and getting sponsors throughout the organization to support it. Organizational leaders should act as \\"climate makers\\" to create a climate that supports innovation.<br />This well-written, well-organized book combines some basic principles about what makes innovation work with examples of companies that have effectively developed new ideas. It provides guidelines for what to do. The basic principles of innovation may sound familiar to anyone already involved in idea creation and development. However, this handbook provides a useful guide or reminder summarizing these basic principles and showing how to put them to work in any organization.	2001-04-06

Chock full of practical \\"do's and don'ts,\\" the book includes plenty of basic information about each country, including history, air travel, telephone, currency, holidays, language, religion, time zones and weather. To fit so much into only 200 pages, the author presents only the most important highlights and writes in a concise, authoritative, yet upbeat style. We [...] recommend this book to those doing business in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, New Zealand, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, and to those doing business elsewhere with men and women from these countries.

International Business Etiquette is an informative mix of fact and opinion about doing business in Europe. With each chapter devoted to one country, the factual sections provide data on airports, currency, weather and other general travel topics. The far more entertaining opinion sections provide a subjective overview of local customs and manners relevant to conducting business within each country's borders. Taken as a whole, the chapters provide a good preview of what business travelers can expect once they set down across the pond. While we [...] recommend this book to any professional with a European trip on the calendar, International Business Etiquette also will provide an enjoyable diversion for any curious readers, who are bound to pick up some useful tips and interesting cocktail conversation.	2001-04-06

Ruth Beckford brings a lifetime of experience and accumulated wisdom to this book of affirmations and short essays aimed at \\"women in the second half of life.\\" Topics, which touch on professional and personal issues, include empowerment, health, romance and inner peace. Although this book contains the same philosophies found in virtually every other self-help or inspirational book, its focus on how these thoughts apply to women at midlife and beyond sets it apart. We [...] recommend this book to those women - at least to the ones who, with their booming careers, adolescent or adult kids, aging parents, active spouses and an occasional night at the theater - still have time to read. Just one criticism, though: These lovely aphorisms have a slight whiff of retirement about them, a faint fragrance that makes us wonder a bit if the author fully understands that 50 isn't quite as old as it used to be.	2001-04-04

It's a shame that some readers might overlook this book as just another entry into the super-saturated and rarely enlightening field of creativity. Using quotes and examples drawn from the origins of well known - and even life-altering - ideas, creations and inventions, Jack Foster has crafted an educational, entertaining and inspirational book. He gets right to the point, makes you laugh and never descends to the level of psychobabble. He is aided and abetted by illustrator Larry Corby.

The 1990s may well be remembered as the decade of employee empowerment (at least in management theory circles), but very few companies ever put their money where their mouths were when it came to dismantling the old \\"command-and-control\\" structures. Thomas O. Davenport makes a fresh case for empowerment by placing the argument in the context of the current tight labor market, and presenting scarce knowledge workers as investors of human capital. These human capital investors should be valued, nurtured and rewarded by companies in much the same way that financial investors are cared for. Although many of the conclusions that result from this novel theory mirror those of earlier works in employee empowerment, we [...] strongly recommend this book for its original take on the changing nature of the employer/employee relationship.	2001-04-04

John Guaspari's instructive and amusing fable about \\"Quality\\" has been a favorite in the business world since it was first published in 1985. As it points out what to do and what not to do in the pursuit of quality and market share, the book illustrates the ups and downs of Punctuation, Inc., the mythical company founded by the inventor of punctuation. This thought-provoking and entertaining little book takes only an hour or two to read, but the author intends for its message to stick with you for a lifetime.

Berry takes an in-depth look at how service can sustain the success of a business in this detailed, footnoted exploration that includes plenty of interviews and examples from the business world. Written authoritatively, yet conversationally, this book outshines similar works because of its thoroughness.

Let's get one thing out of the way: This is not a book about how to conduct last-minute meetings. It is a book about organizing conferences, conventions and other off-site gatherings that involve extensive planning - and preferably not at the last minute. That said, it's a useful book. Fern Dickey provides exactly the kinds of hands-on details that a virgin conference organizer would need, from online resources to relevant organizations, contact information, and sample charts that you can use for record keeping, budgeting and planning. There's nothing groundbreaking here, and there are no secret tactics revealed. Instead, Dickey has produced a thorough working reference that we [...] recommend to anyone new to the dizzying world of conference planning.	2001-04-02

Fields' grandson, Ronald Fields, draws on the comic's biography, movie plots and sayings to illustrate key business principles. He covers such topics as leadership, creativity and innovation, managing change, effective teamwork, delegation, budgeting, office politics and communication. Many of the ideas for business success are familiar - but the link with W.F. Fields makes them novel and entertaining. Appropriately, the book is written in a breezy style that makes it enjoyable to read, and Fields includes a summary of key principles at the end of each chapter. We at ... particularly like the collection of W.C. Fields' humorous sayings at the end of the book. Even though some ideas and, for shame, even some sentences are repeated, the book has broad appeal for anyone who likes business and loves to laugh.

New Age meets the New Economy in this book by British author Nicola Phillips, who shows her cyber-stripes with catchy Internet lingo, and graphics - including underlining, arrows and buttons - that give the book pages the look of Web pages. Whether you find this faux-functionality refreshing or distracting, it truly is original and unique. It's more difficult to say the same about the book's content, which is somewhat unfocused, a bit repetitive and often familiar. Nevertheless, we [...] found it interesting to read this very British approach to the Yankee-dominated self-help genre, spiced up with a jazzy high-tech angle on the most low-tech of all subjects: personal growth.	2001-04-02

Alan Weiss's clarion call for corporate excellence may remind you of your parents' stern guidance in your youth. You weren't sure you wanted to listen to their traditional viewpoints, but you knew they were right. Weiss cites today's watered-down sense of social accountability as the bad seed that has spoiled corporate standards. He insists that constantly lowering standards is not the way to achieve lasting excellence. He warns that executives need to exercise common sense rather than chase every management fad they encounter or succumb to high-priced consultants. Similarly, he warns that executives who surround themselves with sycophants will get carried away with their own egos. At times, Weiss seems to get a bit carried away himself, regaling how he browbeat the service rep when his bottled water delivery went to the wrong address. But we [...] recommend this book as beneficial to executives - and even to consultants - as a refreshing throwback to days before the advent of kinder, gentler management.	2001-04-02

Thanks. You might even already know that you have to check reference materials at the library - another handy nugget of advice. But if your background is in technical expertise, not in word crafting, and you find yourself responsible for actually writing things - a prospect as enticing to you as root canal - then this book is for you. It organizes ideas concisely and simply (Almost too simply: Any sixth grader could use it).

This extremely practical, highly focused book goes through the hands-on details of preparing a presentation or speech. Some of the instructions seem self-evident, but only because author Joan Detz is extremely thorough and recognizes that it is easy to forget these \\"obvious\\" tips under pressure. She provides a vast amount of practical information, far more than anyone could absorb at once, but her tips are worth reading again and again. She also includes good self-assessment forms and questionnaires. Many of these venerable public-speaking concepts date back to the Sermon on the Mount, but Detz adds her own spin by emphasizing that the focus should be on the speaker, not on slides or props (downplay the loaves and fishes). The book's power resides in its completeness; Detz seems to have thought of everything, and that is reassuring.

Author Robin Bloor makes it pretty clear: Either get your business involved with the Internet or prepare for your enterprise to die. Bloor's credentials are fairly impressive. He turned his business, Bloor Research, into a Web business that actually makes a profit, or so it says on the jacket blurb. Bloor is pretty straightforward about the book's focus: mass media communications history, the current Internet and the World Wide Web's future potential. This in-depth read (good and gripping, though the writer's constant use of the @ symbol can be annoying) takes us from Guttenberg all the way to a future filled with smartcards, micropayments and data privacy. The most interesting element is Bloor's speculation on how future media might affect future political systems - because as the information society gives us more data about political happenings, we might want more control over our governments.

Lucky for all of us, Andrew Frothingham's latest book on public speaking manages to integrate both objectives into one clear, concise and funny book. He splits the book into two parts: \\"About Speaking\\" and \\"Gems You Can Use.\\" The first part presents the author's wisdom on effective speech making. He cites rules, pointers and strategies to build your toolkit for designing and delivering great speeches. The second part of the book is composed of well-known quotes grouped into logical speech topic areas such as education, ethics and marriage. Taken together, the two parts of this book form an educational and enjoyable read. Virtually any speaker will find valuable tips and useful quotes for a future presentation.

Stress and anxiety are natural parts of the human experience and can actually improve performance in challenging times. But for those of us with more than our fair share of tension,  C. Eugene Walker has written a helpful book. Walker draws on theories from many psychologists, psychiatrists and other researchers in analyzing the origins of our stress. More importantly, he also provides techniques for overcoming and reducing tension - including more than 40 exercises that will help you calm down. While his basic principles will sound familiar to those who know self-help and personal-development literature, Walker does a good job of combining and organizing these points. We [...] recommend this book to a general audience, but also to top managers and executives who deal with stressed-out employees or feel the pressure mounting themselves.	2001-03-30

Most of us developed our management skills, or lack thereof, in the same way: through trial and error. But Morey Stettner's new book will give anyone freshly promoted to the ranks of management a valuable head start by spelling out practical steps that new managers can take to be effective. For all of you old-timers, reading this book will induce a near constant mental stream of \\"I wish someone had told me that when I was starting out.\\" For example, Stettner's first step, writing out a basic plan of how you want to manage your subordinates, might at first seem a bit naïve to veterans. But consider this point: How much time did you spend thinking about the techniques you would use in managing people before taking over your first managerial assignment? The probable answer is not much. In a clear voice laced with illustrative examples, Stettner covers the critical skills managers rely on every day: speaking, listening, criticizing and disciplining.

After all, the consultants' first piece of advice is that you need to hire them. That caveat aside, you will find this a well-conceived view of the practical mechanics of setting up a good outsourcing program. The text can be redundant, telling you many times over that you need to agree on measures to define a project's success. However, even though authors James Essinger and Charles L. Gay don't dodge all the pitfalls, they do hand you the common-sense fundamentals you need to safely navigate the trendy world of outsourcing.

Offering plenty of inside information and real-life corporate examples, the authors explore their ideas without resorting to fluff or to the dry, dull prose that often fills such books. Given their experience helping corporations choose CEOs and other executives, the authors know what they're talking about and understand the tricky issues involved in putting any advice into practice. Their book delivers what it promises, and given that it can be repetitive, it delivers on some of those promises two or three times (but we're quibbling, some of those lessons do bear repeating).

Ralph W, Estes' powerful work is widely considered one of the most important books written on American corporations and their vast power, and he has nothing kind to say. Compelling and clearly written, his book shines a bright light into some very dark, creepy corners. And although he overstates, over-generalizes and tends to blame corporations for every evil in society, there's no debating that the concept of stakeholder accountability that Estes sets forth has moved to center-stage.

Are you ready to learn from the somewhat mythical, sometimes notorious and often misunderstood inside traders? H. Nejat Seyhun has compressed a gargantuan amount of information - 21 year's worth of reported insider trades, more than one million transactions - into a manual that debunks and reconfigures the wild world of insider trading. Since inside traders are bound by strict laws, their prowess comes from proximity to the action. As a farmer can predict the next big storm by watching his cattle, sophisticated traders can predict the next market windfall by watching the insiders. This isn't a late-night page-turner; after all, Seyhun is a noted academic expert. Yet flashier verbal energy might have sacrificed the book's most valuable quality: precision. This book (the opposite of the Investing for Illiterates-type) takes its readers and itself seriously - If you are serious about your portfolio, we [...] recommend that you put yourself through Seyhun's course.

He discusses how they shape the way we view the corporation as an entity and how we act. His analysis involves a mix of philosophy, history, sociology, anthropology, biology and organizational examples. He moves from industrial-age notions of the organization as a machine, to biological analogies about the organization as an organism. Other metaphors - the organization as a brain, as social reality, as the source of cultural difference and as an arena for power struggles - shape what occurs within corporations. While this book is not an easy read, it illuminates the dynamics of organizational life. We [...] recommend this book to executives, and to readers intrigued by serious societal expositions.	2001-03-26

Ackerman has written a deeply felt and poetically-crafted book that explores eight universal laws relating to identity and leadership. He uses examples from his personal life as well as from his many interactions with business clients to illustrate each of the laws of identity. These laws reflect the values and understandings that govern the productivity and personality of organizations. We [...] recommend this book to anyone interested in leadership philosophy or personal growth.	2001-03-26

Essays compiled by editors Andrew Hurrell and Ngaire Woods examine globalization's current inequalities and prospects for future justice and injustice. Each selection looks at a different aspect of these issues, with contributors primarily reviewing history, analyzing each topic, and avoiding hard prescriptions. Where they do offer proposals, the ideas are carefully reasoned, modest, and practical. Many chapters' concepts overlap, emphasizing the interconnections among these issues. The writing varies from straightforward to academic, but the book is readable, avoids jargon, and argues clearly. Copious endnotes help the reader find more information. We [...] recommend this book to those interested in international economic and trade policy, economic and social justice, international policies, and the new global economy's changing power structures.	2001-03-26

The mantra has been repeated so often that it's become a clich&eacute;: Worker loyalty has disappeared, making every job temporary. Author Kate Wendleton repeats the obvious facts about the increasingly transient work force, but goes beyond the apparent as she supplies inventive ways to approach your career decisions. Her most intriguing suggestion is that you should use a \\"Seven Stories Approach\\" to develop your \\"Forty-Year Vision.\\" The stories help you discover what you're really passionate about so you can build a long-term vision to guide you meaningfully through your career. While the book is repetitious at times, it offers useful examples of job hunters who used Wendleton's tactics to improve their careers. We [...] recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a fresh approach to career change, and to human resource professionals who want to know how applicants are (or should be) thinking.	2001-03-26

Reiter envision a trip down your supply chain like an effortless sail on calm seas. Your organization can reach this placid efficiency, they explain, by forming partnerships with suppliers and others in your business network. But the authors don't ask you to take their word; instead they present detailed case studies of companies that have implemented supply-chain optimization strategies and reaped prodigious benefits. The book's only flaw is its style. It is densely written and often weighed down by prose as murky as a rural delivery system and twice as difficult to penetrate. But we [...] recommend that business owners, corporate managers, executives and logisticians of all levels take the time required to patiently excavate the practical and pragmatic information that lies within.	2001-03-26

How the rich got that way is an interesting enough topic. But an interesting topic does not necessarily make an intriguing book. Author Steve Mariotti profiles 20 well-known 20th-century entrepreneurs. You will easily recognize the names Bezos, Branson, Burrell, Kroc, Roddick, Walton, Ford and Winfrey. However, the author presents little new information about them. His profiles are short; three to four pages, and take the tone of corporate press releases. The book works best as a compendium of capitalist success stories, and we [...] recommend it as a student's primer in entrepreneurial studies. Since the author shares cover credit with the charitable program he launched to help low-income teen entrepreneurs, that might be just the audience that the author had in mind.	2001-03-26

This is a very interesting book for anyone who wonders why he or she is unhappy at work or how to make the workplace more human. The book is based on the \\"Seven Principles of Inner Excellence.\\" Each principle is stated at the outset of a chapter and then explained through storytelling, using both personal stories and classics. You will recognize the stories told by the author, but their application in a business context has new value.<br />Some readers might have difficulty appreciating the concepts raised in this book, although it is written in a very simple, direct style. As the author acknowledges, these spiritual concepts may be foreign to most business people. Still, you may enjoy getting to understand them. In fact, the messages in this book tend to grow on readers after a few days. We [...] recommend this book to middle level managers who wish to consider these humanistic principles for themselves and their employees, and to owners of small to medium-sized businesses who want to introduce a spiritual element into their business practices.	2001-03-26

Swanson for writing clearly, interestingly and compellingly on the subject of creating effective programs to improve workplace performance. He champions approaching this task with up-front analysis based on systems theory. Since he criticizes ordinary management for not understanding this problem and for not knowing the methods that can be used to resolve it, we [...] recommend this book not only to Human Resources professionals, but also to managers and executives in all industries.

Erika Brown profiles 16 computer and Internet industry leaders in this informative and entertaining book. A senior reporter for Forbes, Brown brings a journalist's insight to each profile and seeks to extract the ideas and strategies that made each of these over-achievers successful. She packs plenty of information into chunks that seem a bit short for a book, but are at least longer than today's standard magazine profiles. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of her profiles is the way many of them reveal the dynamics between two powerful leaders at companies like Microsoft and Intel. We [...] recommend this book as a brief introduction to the men and women whom history will record as the titans of turn-of-the-century technology.	2001-03-23

While the market is flooded with books on how to pitch, sell, wrangle and close a deal, this book rises well above most of them. Author Roger Dawson takes salespeople step by step through the economic and psychological aspects of successful negotiating. Expertly and conversationally written, and strategically structured, this book actually delivers what its title promises: plenty of secrets about power negotiating. View your job in sales as a chess game you can control because you know the rules, from the opening gambit to the power plays in the middle, to the all-important close. If you've read Dawson's Secrets of Power Negotiating, you'll find a good bit of repetition here, but even when he cites the same gambits, he discusses using them to make sales. You only need to read one of the two books, but we [...] say make it this one if you're in sales. Learn these gambits, so you can say, \\"Checkmate.\\"	2001-03-23

Author Edwin Black presents a compelling account of how IBM got its start in the early days of computing by providing the calculations that enabled the Nazis to identify and process Jews and other groups that were targeted for imprisonment and elimination. Black's detailed, heavily documented  (note the 75 pages of end notes) saga draws on thousands of historic papers, as well as interviews conducted with the help of more than 100 volunteer researchers. Black asserts that IBM's technology helped make the Holocaust possible and that IBM's Thomas Watson was a Nazi sympathizer who saw his deal with the Nazis as good business. This fascinating book puts IBM's history of conformist culture in a new light, although it reveals a story IBM undoubtedly would rather leave untold. We [...] recommend this fine work of historical reporting to general readers and academics, as well as executives and managers. You'll be enthralled and outraged.	2001-03-23

Author Simon Anholt, an international advertising consultant, says that the dangers of globalization can be just as formidable as the opportunities - if you fail to research the culture of your new markets. We've all heard the marketing legends of companies that embarrassed themselves by launching products into foreign markets without checking the translation of their brand names. Anholt retells several of these tales to illustrate the perils that await global firms that don't take culture into account. Meshing advertising and marketing strategy, he presents a systemic approach to cross-border product expansion. We [...] recommend this book not only for its insightful, culturally adaptive marketing methodology, but also for the genuinely entertaining examples that might just make you laugh out loud.	2001-03-23

Trade professional Jeffrey Edmund Curry provides a solid introduction to the principles of worldwide marketing. This book, with its simple definitions of basic marketing terms, will be most appreciated by lower-level employees at companies with newly expanded, global horizons. Newcomers to international business will find information on a wide range of key topics: understanding the role of governments, developing products for the foreign market, doing market research, preparing for market entry, developing distribution, advertising and promotion, making your initial contacts, staffing the new market, evaluating performance and creating a marketing plan and market audit.

Spendolini forgoes the usual generalities of management theory in favor of a how-to practicality. The first edition of his book helped to establish the concept of benchmarking in the mainstream of organizational practice. For those of you who don't know, benchmarking is a continuous-improvement strategy that seeks to improve products, services or operations by comparing them with the best practices of industry competitors and other companies nationally and worldwide. Spendolini offers a five-step model that can be applied by any company. He also provides a helpful, step-by-step guide to applying the process, though he does get a little repetitive as he describes the model and details each step. But we [...] nevertheless recommend this book to managers and executives as perhaps the best benchmarking primer on the shelf.	2001-03-23

Eric Uhlfelder's book could be titled \\"Europe 101: An Introduction for Americans.\\" European readers will not gain much by reading this work, which is filled with the very basic basics of Europe's politics, economies and companies. But for Americans looking to diversify their newly constructed stock portfolios, it is a valuable resource, profiling the EU and the economic strengths and weaknesses of EU and non-EU countries. The book also profiles key companies, such as Nokia, SAP, Adecco and others, and discusses which individual stocks and mutual funds you should acquire. We [...] recommend this interesting primer to Yankee readers, who might be surprised to learn how fast Ireland is growing, how much Austria's fling with the far right cost the country and how a French utility firm is positioned to take over the world.	2001-03-22

Because this is a dense read, you won't be surprised to learn that the author, Daniel E. O'Leary, is a Ph.D. If you don't have a conversational grasp of acronyms - including, but not limited to ERP, LAN, WAN, SMEs BOPSE, MAPs, SAP and BAAN - then you'll have to decode as you read. If you're actually interested in using the business resource known as \\"Enterprise Resource Planning,\\" or ERP, your company should be grossing some $200 million a year, because ERP costs about $15 million to implement. While O'Leary makes a very compelling case in favor of ERP, citing integration of information infrastructure, real-time data, value creation and other wonderful attributes, this is a very expensive and risky resource to pursue. Companies such as Microsoft and Cisco had a hard time implementing it and even they have to worry about cost. We [...] warn that this is serious tech for Big Money companies.

If you're looking for a philosophical, out-of-the-mainstream approach to restructuring your company, author Danah Zohar offers it. She presents an exhaustive, if at times repetitive, case for replacing inflexible, old-line companies with more agile, quantum organizations. Problematically, Zohar devotes too many words to theory and not enough to practical steps for restructuring, and her book is light on examples of companies that have successfully used quantum theory to reorganize. Still, her underlying case is strong. Anyone stuck in a staid bureaucracy would prefer a company where assumptions are actively questioned. To her credit, Zohar offers a starting point for the difficult task of streamlining stodgy organizations. We [...] recommend her ideas to any manager seeking an unusual and thoughtful look at corporate restructuring.	2001-03-22

David Stauffer's impressive new book seeks to explain why Cisco is one of the world's most important companies. At the heart of the book - and perhaps the company - is the management style of Cisco CEO John Chambers, who once worked for IBM and Wang. The book illustrates how Chambers noted the problems at both of his former employers and resolved that they would never show up at Cisco. The author also covers Cisco's famed acquisition strategy, and explains how the company targets employees, rather than profits, in its acquisition sights. Although the author seems enamored with the company, it's tough to argue with his main points, especially when he cites other companies, such as Oracle and Microsoft, that have replicated Cisco strategies. We [...] recommend this definitive and entertaining book as an insightful look into a pivotal new-economy company, and the strategies that got it to where it is today.	2001-03-22

Take a week off from work and read this book! Rarely is a massive biography a pleasure to read. Usually, even the most critically acclaimed biographies are long on tedious detail and short on page-turning storytelling and exquisite style. Vincent Curcio's biography of automotive pioneer Walter Chrysler is the exception to all these norms. Fascinating, impeccably written and completely engrossing, this sweeping tale is more than just a biography. True to its title, it is also a panoramic view of Walter Chrysler's times. Don't be put off by the length, even though index and all, it is 699 pages long. Even if you don't think you're interested in the automotive industry, read this book anyway.  We [...]  join the ranks of critics and industry insiders who've praised it and promises you will not be able to put it down.	2001-03-22

Jeffrey Dyer, an accomplished scholar and management teacher, has developed a cogent and sophisticated theory of extended enterprise management based on a wealth of empirical data from the history of Toyota in Japan and from his six-year study of Chrysler Corp. before its merger with Daimler-Benz. Beyond being a detailed and rigorous case study of the automobile manufacturing industry, Dyer's book presents an extremely valuable model for vertical integration. His model can be applied to other complex product industries, though he is honest about the limits of its applicability. This book provides a clear, effective blueprint for achieving value-chain collaboration. We [...] recommend it to consultants, executives in complex product industries and leaders in firms that supply components or materials. If you always suspected you were part of a greater whole, now you can be sure.	2001-03-22

Michael Craig, a securities attorney, describes the basis for success or failure in 50 big money business deals. He examines the strategy, risks and personality dynamics involved. Craig highlights 10 rules for success he gleaned by observing patterns in these deals, rules you can apply to your own business transactions. This well-crafted book groups several deals to illustrate each rule, although many of the deals reflect several principles. At the end of each story, the author recaps the lesson at hand and explains what went right or wrong. While executives, company owners, and those who do deals for them will find this book especially valuable, we at getAbstract also recommend it to general readers, who will enjoy reading these inside accounts of well-publicized deals.	2001-03-21

Murray's book delves into the well-worn themes of globalization and digitization, but manages to differentiate itself from the rest of the New Economy flotilla by offering up specific, practical suggestions on how consumers and business owners can cope. Many of Murray's major points have been presented more effectively in other books, such as Tom Friedman's The Lexus and the Olive Tree. That said, his advice on health care, education and career advancement in the New Economy is useful and easy to understand. So we at getAbstract recommend this book less for its broad overview of the Internet Economy and more for its common-sense wisdom for daily life in a dotcom world. (One caveat: as a result of the recent technology slump, some of Murray's analysis is already somewhat dated.)	2001-03-21

Glassman and Kevin A. Hassett argue that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will go up to 36,000 over the next few years, since stocks are currently undervalued. However, as more investors recognize this undervaluation, it will be harder and harder for you to make big profits on stocks. Thus, they exhort, invest now. The collapse of the tech bubble and the subsequent equity market sell-off put these thoughts in a new perspective, but Glassman and Hassett maintain that although some price corrections are inevitable, stocks will rise strongly in the long term. Apart from their theories about stock valuations and Dow increases, they also offer solid investment tips from the familiar conservative canon: diversify and hold for the duration. We at getAbstract recommend this book to a general audience of investors - as both a serious analysis of stock market trends and a reminder of more optimistic times.	2001-03-21

This effective little tale introduces readers to \\"Fish!\\" - the authors' prescription for boosting employee morale and productivity. The fish-tossing, joke-cracking camaraderie of the market serves as the workplace ideal in this book, which is easy to read but carries a lasting punch. We at getAbstract recommend this book to executives, change agents, managers, staff members, and students. Whether you are trapped in a bad working environment or trying to improve a mediocre one, this book will inspire you to get up and change your surroundings. Fish! will be one of the most influential books you read all year.	2001-03-21

Keith Checkley believes in a simple premise: Cash flow is the heart of business. It is also the heart of his new book, a sequel to 1995's Cash is King. Using a detailed and exhaustive discussion of the cash-flow cycle as his springboard, Checkley leaps into the depths of business strategy, product development and restructurings. Just when it's all getting a bit too deep, he surfaces with penetrating case studies from companies like Dell. We at getAbstract recommend this book to financial and non-financial pros alike, all of whom will benefit from its succinct definitions of finance terms and its clear explanation of critical mathematic formulas. While many business and management books suffer from a lack of hard fact and applicability, Checkley gives you the numbers, or more importantly, he gives you the knowledge you need to crunch your own.	2001-03-21

As the book jacket states, \\"There are plenty of books out there that show you how to climb the corporate ladder by applying the good old-fashioned virtues of honesty, integrity, loyalty and hard work. This book isn't one of those.\\" In fact, this manual isn't for the faint of heart. It contains some of the nastiest, dirtiest tricks around for getting ahead, including how to punish your subordinates, take your supervisor's job and spread vicious rumors. Although the battle imagery can be grating, what the author writes is (unfortunately) usually true. Those climbing the corporate ladder will benefit from his advice. Those already at the top apparently already know everything in this book. Still, it's entertaining and easy to read - perfect for lunchtime. We at getAbstract recommend this book for corporate climbers willing to do what it takes.	2001-03-21

Intelligently and clearly written, it is by no means light reading, and wasn't intended to be. Rosensweig covers each corner of the globe, putting such issues as population, development and economic status in perspective. He expertly guides you through complex historical and financial issues and information, and manages to connect all the dots. We at getAbstract recommend this serious book to executives, managers and other thoughtful participants who are interested in present and future global commerce. \\"Serious\\" is the approach here, no dilettantes allowed.	2001-03-21

We at getAbstract recommend this thoughtful analysis, which is written in a lively style to have broad appeal not only to executives and managers, but also to the general public and to academics studying popular culture. And if you want to know why there are klieg lights at the supermarket and clowns in the department store, here's your answer.	2001-03-21

Job seekers and job holders alike tend to think they're National Football League free-agents when it comes to getting and keeping jobs in this low unemployment era. Thus, corporations can find it very tempting to act like football teams - throw money at recruits, throw money at employees with wanderlust - and then throw up their hands when people leave. No need for all that, say authors Jim Harris and Joan Brannick. Finding and keeping great employees isn't about winning the bidding, it's about getting to the source of employee alienation and rebuilding connections among people, their jobs, their lives and your company. We at getAbstract recommend this book to employees, especially unhappy ones, and to human resources professionals of all stripes, from recruiters to compensation analysts to development specialists, and even football coaches.	2001-03-21

The eighth edition of this extremely thorough, classic stock market primer has been completely revised. Louis Engel wrote it more than forty years ago, and in this eighth edition, Henry R. Hecht up-dates it for contemporary readers. This critically acclaimed book provides a ground-level explanation of every aspect of the stock market and investing, while also offering savvy investment principles. It provides an introductory base covering terms and a broad picture of stock investing, and then builds a solid package of information. The book is clearly organized, as befits a traditional reference in the field. As the author says, \\"This is a book about how to make your money earn more money for you by investing it. It is not a book about how to make a fortune...\\" We at getAbstract recommend this book as a standard for anyone interested in making investments, and anyone intrigued by the investment industry.	2001-03-20

He presents every step in the sales process and offers advice about every obstacle that you are likely to encounter. While his impressive credentials and experience qualify him to speak and write about successful sales techniques, these strategies, as presented in this book, may backfire when used on today's savvy consumers. Nearly every one of the author's suggestions involves obvious sales one-liners, maneuvers, and psychological tricks that today's marketing-saturated consumer is either immune to or would see right through in an instant. Although written in great detail with plenty of useful examples, this book serves best as an adjunct to other reading material on the subject. We at getAbstract recommend this book to anyone who has to sell a product or service and wants basic information.	2001-03-20

Robert tell you why men are super-salespeople on Mars but idiots on Venus. This challenging and important topic - selling to the opposite gender - is, in itself, a pretty tough sell. The danger is that it inherently involves working with gender generalities and variabilities, and we have all been properly conditioned against that. The authors are a couple of experienced veterans who sometimes seem to lapse into stereotypes. Anyone who has been in the sales trenches would have to agree they are on to something, however, particularly when their advice is specific. In fact, many of the common-sense pointers presented in these pages would be applicable in relationships both professional and personal. As such, we at getAbstract recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve his or her rapport with the opposite sex - for business or otherwise.	2001-03-20

Coyle offers basic advice for people pondering retirement. The book outlines straightforward strategies for saving and investing, and urges investors to start early and to put as much as they can into 401(k) plans and IRAs. So much for the obvious. Coyle also offers specific and useful guidelines for buying mutual funds and allocating assets. He realistically presents issues you may face in retirement, such as the emotional difficulties involved in leaving a career and having enough money to support your lifestyle (so buy a bond instead of that snazzy watch). Some of the book's basic advice will seem redundant to sophisticated investors, but the more detailed information will intrigue even them. We at getAbstract recommend this book for anyone looking for guidance about saving and investing for retirement. [getAbstract note: The investment advice here - tax laws, stock markets, and what not - is extremely U.S.-oriented, although the lifestyle information is broadly applicable.]	2001-03-20

To learn how to cure conflicts or head them off before they become major conflagrations, spend a little time with author Peg Pickering. Her brief but compelling guide to conflict resolution is a must read for every employee from the mailroom gang to the CEO. She offers practical, usable methods for understanding, diffusing and resolving conflicts ranging from minor annoyances to major blow-outs. Strongly and honestly written, the book is devoid of fluff and goes right to the point without pages and pages of psychobabble. We at getAbstract recommend this book to everyone who has to deal with anyone else.	2001-03-20

Nobody wants to need Stephen Mitchell Sack's new book, but everyone should. Anyone can be fired, anytime. Sack was sacked, unfairly, from his first job out of law school. It must have ticked him off, because he's become the adviser of the pink-slipped population. His book explains when to call a lawyer if you're fired and gives an overview of U.S. laws protecting employees from discrimination and unfair dismissal. Despite the necessary legal lingo, the author keeps it readable. He warns you to prepare for dismissal before it ever happens and shows that simple record keeping can boost your severance package. From sample letters to a list of relevant government agencies, this is one handy manual for the let-go, downsized, or dismissed. However, its utility is limited to those working under U.S. laws. We at getAbstract recommend this book to employers and employees, regardless of whether you think you need it. You do.	2001-03-20

Dust off those liberal arts degrees before opening this challenging treatise on knowledge management, written by a trio of academics who call themselves \\"constructionists,\\" quote Sartre and speak passionately of \\"post-modernism.\\" Their work explains how to gain initiative and constructive input from workers by modifying traditional command structures - a grounded approach that is much more realistic than the revolutionary conversions called for by other experts. Managers who balk at the thought of granting autonomy or increased access to their employees may well be converted away from their hierarchical dogma here. We at getAbstract particularly recommend the lively knowledge-creation case histories and the wonderful section explaining how companies can create valid, imaginative futures. (What if IBM had imagined a world in which software was more important than mainframes?)	2001-03-20

Reluctant attorney, Stewart Levine, provides a rational framework to justify spending his life avoiding conflict and confrontation. Even in the business world, he takes a pass on legal action and other logical ways of fighting back in a conflict. Instead, when opinions differ and arguments flourish, he seeks a higher course of reconciliation and collaboration. His seven-step resolution process saves time and money, launders egos, and advances clarity. Although each chapter is summed up almost too tidily in a final paragraph, or even a final sentence, Levine does not stint. In each chapter, he shares real world examples from his life and career. We at getAbstract recommend this book to anyone who wants to rationalize a business deal based solely on trust, to anyone searching for a deal-making scenario where lawyers are not invited, and to people who are looking for the words to express their desire to just get along.	2001-03-20

How long has it been since you came across a book that you want to read twice? This book, with its eye-catching cover featuring the title as an embossed leather patch on the backside of a pair of blue jeans, is that kind of book. Authors Richard D. Czerniawski and Michael W. Maloney created this organized guide for marketing professionals and wrote it in a way that lets every reader learn. You are always told what you are about to learn, you're tested on that knowledge and then you are given real-life examples that reinforce the lesson. The authors debunk \\"established\\" methods, which they find condescending to marketing professionals. They believe that most marketers are tactically strong, but need to learn more about the strategic requirements of creating brand loyalty. We at getAbstract strongly recommend this book to senior managers, marketers, academics and - if you want to be savvy, too - consumers.	2001-03-20

While this book is meant to serve as an introduction to the complex world of hedge funds, hedge fund managers and hedge fund investors (in short, the hedge fund dynamic), it is decidedly not of the For Dummies family that currently dominates the do-it-yourself investment section of the book store. This is a highly sophisticated look at what has become one of the most exciting sectors of the investment world. If you have some knowledge of finance and its terminology, and you want to know what a hedge fund is, what kinds of strategies most hedge fund managers use and whether or not you'd want to or be able to invest in hedge funds, we ... recommend this highly specific book to you. On the other hand, if you just want to gain some insights into the investment world, you'd be better off picking up the financial section of the newspaper. Hedge funds are serious and so is Joseph G. Nicholas' book. (... note: Despite the 1999 copyright date, the book makes no reference to Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that collapsed in 1998, nearly bringing about a global financial crisis.)	2001-03-20

Whether you're working a room at a cocktail party, a fund-raiser, a special event, or a reunion, or just standing in line at the grocery store, Susan RoAne has plenty of tips to help you lose your jitters and enjoy yourself. Stressing the business and social benefits of making lively conversation and having the ability to \\"work the room,\\" this book covers every stage of an event, from planning how you'll deal with it, to whether you should send a thank-you note afterwards. Written in a lively style, this book is a quick read that includes just enough anecdotes, and plenty of no-nonsense, though not subtle, tips. We at getAbstract recommend it to everyone who ever has to go anywhere, and wants to know how to make the most of it.	2001-03-20

Benton discusses how chief executive officers succeed. She bases her information on interviews with hundreds of major corporations' CEOs and with well-known leaders and public figures. The experiences of so many CEOs make the book fascinating. Readers will be intrigued by the many success stories. Benton also extrapolates and explains the key principles behind the success of these executives. The book is an excellent, well-written guide that includes some well-known success principles and some that may be less well-known. The short, snappy, easy-to-read style is accessible. A helpful summary at the end of each chapter captures the major principles covered. We at getAbstract recommend this book to those on the way up in management, those interested in getting into management, and those who wish to apply these principles of success in their own careers.	2001-03-20

Jeff Slutsky brings his expertise as the head of his own marketing and consulting firm to the basics of getting clients and keeping them. He provides plenty of insider secrets. Written in a straight-forward manner with little fluff, this book includes the psychology of pitching a new client and keeping an old client happy. It covers things you can do to make a prospective client say \\"yes.\\" These are valuable insights when clients are your bread and butter. The book offers just enough anecdotes to illustrate some key points. We at getAbstract recommend this book to anyone who works with clients and wants to be even better at it, and have more of them.	2001-03-20

This book is about using and encouraging intense teams at work. Jean Lipman-Blumen and Harold J. Leavitt make it clear that hot groups are not a new management phenomenon. They have existed since the beginning of time. The ability of hot groups to respond to problems quickly with innovative solutions will make them an essential component of organizations in the future. Many of the techniques mentioned in this book can be used without instituting major changes in your organization. While the book offers many organizational case studies as evidence of the effectiveness of hot groups, it lacks hard numerical data showing the bottom-line results organizations get when they support hot groups. Despite that, we at getAbstract recommend this book to managers and leaders who want to introduce or use hot groups or are already using groups in their organization.	2001-03-20

While the ideas are not generally new, they are effective. The book concisely presents many tools for supervisors. You don't need to sort through jargon - just turn to the thorough, step-by-step lists and scan them for quick reference. The simple and easy-to-follow techniques provide all of a supervisor's essential tools. Experienced supervisors can use this book to refine their skills and improve any weak areas, while neophytes can use it to supplement their knowledge as they gain experience. We at getAbstract recommend this book to supervisors at all levels and to employees hoping to be promoted to supervisory roles. If you keep this straightforward guide in your top desk drawer and refer to it regularly, you can sound like an expert anytime.	2001-03-20

You can figure out who you are - and more importantly, who the people you lead are - if you have a little patience with Roger R. Pearman. The author carefully applies the Myers-Briggs personality type system to explain leadership styles. He asserts that if you understand how people behave, one personality type at a time, you can lead them more effectively. You can use this system to understand how your employees (and you) think, and to spot strengths and weaknesses. Pearman's examples, lists and charts show how to identify different personality types and how to apply this understanding in different situations. We at getAbstract recommend this excellent book as particularly helpful to those who are familiar with the Myers-Briggs system and to those who like taking an analytical approach to human behavior. (If you are less analytical, don't get testy while trying to sort out the 16 personality types - The trip is worthwhile.)	2001-03-20

Don Tapscott has compiled information about today's youth and what they will mean to the future of the economy and society. He interviewed children extensively and he found that the new generation bases its thinking on technology. Its ideas of work and play are very different from those in the past.<br />The book is an easy read, written in a way that draws you into the world of today's youth. Common misconceptions about kids are tossed away in favor of information about the realities of this generation. Companies that wish to compete in the new millennium are urged to throw off the past and embrace the new generation and its ideas. Tapscott describes the Net Generation in a very good light - almost too good to be true. The book is well written and interesting. It can help any organization prepare for the future. We at getAbstract recommend the book to executives who deal with strategic issues or manage technology intensive companies.	2001-03-20

Klinvex present a guide to creating a more effective hiring process. They cover each step, from defining the job to hiring the best person. The book provides techniques for attracting the right employees through advertising and promotion. It also covers effective use of applications, interviews, testing, and background checks. This book is clear, well-organized, and easy-to-read. While some of the suggestions may be obvious to those who are experienced at hiring, they are presented in a careful, step-by-step way. We at getAbstract recommend this book to those involved in the hiring process in larger companies, from company owners and top managers to human resource professionals. Small business owners who wish to use more sophisticated hiring techniques may also find it useful.	2001-03-20

She looks at a variety of financial formulas that can help you unearth good deals. This is a useful primer for investors, since it offers clear explanations of financial ratios. The book includes plenty of specific examples of ways to apply formulas to a company's financial statements. She clearly describes the contents of SEC documents and offers helpful advice about when to sell a stock. We at getAbstract recommend this book for beginner to intermediate investors, for those unfamiliar with \\"value investing,\\" and for those interested in basic portfolio planning. This book focuses on the United States stock market and may be less useful in other countries.	2001-03-20

Bond presents a guide for people who want to become home-based consultants. His manual covers every aspect of freelance consulting, from finding, landing, and keeping clients, to maintaining records and understanding the marketplace. This common-sense book is part narrative and part workbook, including questionnaires and fill-in list forms. It is detailed, but if you have any experience as a solo practitioner, the elementary basic business practices outlined may cover material you already know. We at getAbstract recommend this book as a primer for anyone who wants to become a consultant working from a home-office and to those who are already doing exactly that and would like a few more tips about how to make a better living at it.	2001-03-20

Dale Carnegie compiles time tested wisdom in this book of principles on how to avoid worrying about problems you can't affect. Carnegie outlines some basic principles to help you stop worrying. He draws from common sense, from people who have achieved peace and happiness, and from the sayings of philosophers, business leaders and others. Although Carnegie wrote his book in the 1940's and some of his examples may seem dated, his basic principles are timeless - in fact, ahead of his time. He presents them in an easy-to-read, personal way. He draws on his own and other people's experiences to show a number of techniques for letting go of worries and becoming more productive. We at getAbstract recommend this self-development classic to everyone.	2001-03-20

Author Masaaki Imai argues that companies can become more profitable by constantly looking for efficiencies, instead of seeking huge leaps, as is the Western custom. The Japanese philosophy of kaizen says businesses must mercilessly cut waste by eliminating anything that's even remotely inefficient. These strategies will lead to more profitable companies and better employee morale. Imai makes compelling arguments, and supports them with a number of case studies and real world examples that show kaizen in action. We at getAbstract recommend this book to managers, particularly executives of manufacturing companies.	2001-03-20

Robert Buderi has produced a work of impressive detail - a thoroughly documented account of the workings of the world's leading research labs. The book carefully follows the financial swings of the R&amp;D effort, and closely examines the increasing pressure on researchers to turn a quick buck. The history of this critical economic component is probably unknown to most readers, and Buderi tells an engrossing tale. The book's one inescapable shortcoming, however, is the fact that Buderi finishes his story without a mention of the vast innovation currently sprouting from sources far afield of the Fortune 500. In addition, little mention is made of what makes some research efforts flourish while others fade. Nevertheless, we at getAbstract highly recommend Engines of Tomorrow as a book that rises beyond a simple corporate history to a study in human innovation.	2001-03-19

Remember the old Broadway song, \\"You gotta have a dream, or how you gonna have a dream come true?\\" This is the executive version. Author Leslie L. Kossoff maintains that executives must have - and must clearly and enthusiastically articulate - a dream of what a company can be in order to get everyone else in the company excited, aligned and active. As an executive (or as a climber of that ladder), you may find this a pretty reasonable introduction to leadership, though it could also sound fairly simplistic. Kossoff offers a few non-specific examples, either citing news stories or alluding to individual executives, but primarily she tells us how she thinks successful executives should behave. Like the content, the book's tone also is a little reminiscent of a show tune -not too challenging and enjoyable to hum - but its attitude is sincere. We at getAbstract recommend this refresher as a philosophical pep talk that reminds executives how their approach to their jobs affects the realization of their dreams.	2001-03-19

Unless you own the company and all your children are born executives, creating an executive team is a deliberate strategic process. To put you on that path, Robert W. Barner offers a comprehensive guidebook for creating an optimum executive team. He examines ways to look at the competencies your firm needs, evaluate current leadership, recruit, build leadership skills, and prepare for succession and other issues. Support materials include a mix of charts, checklists, examples and rating forms. The book, a fairly authoritative, well-organized, in-depth exploration of the topic, is clearly, though somewhat dryly, written. Given the topic, we at getAbstract recommend it primarily to those involved in executive development and search techniques, including senior-level human resource personnel, organizational development managers and search consultants. It may be particularly enlightening for board members who find themselves involved in executive recruitment.	2001-03-19

If you want to know how to get into the latest hot IPO, you probably can't. But don't let that dissuade you from reading Robert Natale's book, in which the Bear Stearns money manager argues that the quickest way to get rich is by investing in small cap stocks. Despite his enthusiasm, Natale is no wide-eyed cheerleader for the small cap market. He acknowledges that these are risky investments that are susceptible to devastating downturns and wealth-sapping manipulation. It's not the sort of argument one would expect from a small-cap guru, but Natale makes a convincing case. He also provides a solid primer for beginner investors, as well as guidelines and mathematic formulas that will help any individual investor evaluate small stock and IPO investments. We at getAbstract recommend this book to anyone interested in boosting the returns on a personal portfolio.	2001-03-19

Janelle Barlow and Dianna Maul go a step beyond most consultants (those who write business books to drum up customers). Instead, they offer a wealth of scholarly research and sources in their in-depth, colorfully written book, which successfully tackles the enormous role that emotions play in business and customer behavior. They explain and document it, and provide practical applications. We at getAbstract recommend this important book to all business people, whether they offer a product or a service, from CEOs through every level of staff.	2001-03-19

Weisbord and Sandra Janoff describe a three-day program to help organizations develop a future plan. Their conference is designed to unite groups of people from different areas of an organization so they can create a program together that they all support. Typically, the conference includes 50 to 70 people who review the past, explore the present environment, create future scenarios, identify common ground and make action plans. The program encourages dialogue and working together as peers.<br />Future Search suggests how you might organize this program yourself, from setting up the agenda to planning the logistics. Because the book is a specific, practical guide for a particular type of conference, it will primarily interest those leaders and managers who want to put on such a program. We at getAbstract recommend Future Search as a good hands-on tool for companies, non-profits, government agencies or other organizations that want to hold a future planning conference.	2001-03-19

Chris Argyris says that management advice - the content of countless seminars by management consultants and human resource professionals - rests upon a discrepancy. The goal of a more democratic workplace with empowered, internally-driven workers contradicts the actual actions executives take to produce this result. Argyris contends that much leadership, decision-making, corporate change and management advice lacks critical thinking. He urges executives to seek specific, testable, actionable advice. Role-playing and numerous examples show how advice givers may fail to understand the nature of the problems they're addressing. This book is valuable in helping managers identify flawed advice and understand why so many management initiatives fail. However, the author's own recommendations suffer from the same lack of testability. It just may not be possible to test for the effects of specific advice in complex situations. Still, this is an important book because it urges executives to think critically about the guidance they are given. We at getAbstract recommend this book to managers and to those who advise them.	2001-03-19

Sunstein's book is a serious piece of scholarship about very engaging legal and social issues concerning economics and law. The book derives both strengths and weaknesses from its beginnings as a series of lectures presented from 1990 to 1995. Each chapter presents a thoughtful thesis, but not all chapters link together in a clearly understandable manner. However, a reader who is prepared to put in the required effort, will gain a wealth of thought-provoking material. We at getAbstract recommend this book to anyone who misses pure intellectual challenge. Lawyers, policy makers, and economists are most likely to appreciate it.	2001-03-19

You may have regarded Queen Elizabeth I of England in many ways - as a ruler, as a dramatic historical figure, as the prototype of a powerful woman, but have you ever thought of her as a corporate manager? Alan Axelrod has. He explains how the Virgin Queen exemplified principles of good business leadership during her reign from 1558 to 1603. He shows how these ideals helped her survive to become queen and how she used them to transform England from a tumultuous country to a powerful empire. Lessons from her rule can show any CEO a few things about leadership in perilous times. The book's combination of management principles with the drama of Elizabethan history makes for compelling reading. One critical note - the book skips around historically, which muddies the sequence of events. Otherwise, we at getAbstract recommend this excellent mix of enjoyable historical reading with powerful reminders about the fundamental principles of effective leadership.	2001-03-19

Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen unfold the evolution of human intelligence from the beginnings of time. Their basic theory is that inorganic matter combined with carbon and became self-organizing, providing the basis for life. Over millions of years, this matter interacted with the environment and gained intelligence. Physical and intelligent matter co-evolved and eventually became human. While the book presents an intriguing, novel and reasonably well-argued scientific position about evolution, many readers may find it tough going, in that it offers exhaustive detail about the processes involved. The authors extensively discuss game theory, mathematical probability, chemistry, physics, DNA and natural selection. In addition, they include some speculative breaks - in the form of conversations about these ideas with an imaginary alien - that are hard to follow. Skip them. We at getAbstract recommend this book to scientifically inclined readers with a grounding in science, math and physical anthropology, who will relish the depth of information the authors provide.	2001-03-19

James Buchan has written an enthralling book about the history and impact of money. He treats money as an evolving concept from early Greek writings to symbolic references in art. He considers the ability of money to speak for human desire, including its role in the primary needs to wage war and to make love. The book's style shifts from detailed historical review to literary criticism, so it is not always an easy read, but it is always fascinating. We at getAbstract recommend this book to executives who want to learn more about money's intrinsic power. Read it to learn how money shapes your world in ways you may not have considered.	2001-03-19

It's tough to pick up a magazine or turn on the television these days without someone telling you that you must turn your company into an e-company in order to survive. But once you get past these exhortations to \\"embrace change,\\" it's surprisingly hard to find any practical advice on how to integrate e-commerce into your company's business plan. Therein lies the value of Faisal Hoque's e-Enterprise, which disposes of generalities and plunges headlong into an explanation of online business models, applications, architecture and tools. For the technologically challenged, this book will go down like castor oil. But if you are running a business - any business - Hoque's exhaustive blueprint to creating a true e-business will be exactly the right medicine. For that reason, we at getAbstract.com implore executives and managers to bite the techie bullet and read this book, which also will satisfy even the hardest-core geeks with its encyclopedic guide to the components that constitute the building blocks of the e-Enterprise.	2001-03-19

Lengel present a new model of leadership. They contrast fusion leadership with traditional fission leadership that is based upon dividing the workplace into roles and tasks based on position and function. The book draws on many of the new ideas in management and leadership based on notions of chaos, change, creativity, intuition, personal empowerment, dialogue, future search and other principles. It mixes new science, spirituality and New Age thinking. While some readers may view these ideas as a welcome change from the traditional, rational approach to management, others may find them overly mushy and touchy-feely. However, within the growing genre of soft-leadership style books, it is well-written and well organized. We at getAbstract recommend this book to executives interested in non-traditional leadership approaches.	2001-03-19

Which came first, you'll wonder after reading this book, the future or Futurize Your Enterprise? There's nothing cryptic about the message here: Thanks to the Internet and e-mail, the little people who buy your products and services are talking to each other, and in so doing, they're becoming powerful. If you're not ready to put the customer first and get rid of your Old World habits, your business will never succeed. Futurize Your Enterprise is a patient introduction to this new era, a wonderfully workable framework for forging ahead into the Brave New World of e-commerce. David Siegel's valuable prognostications rise out of a refreshing blend of common sense and potent intelligence. Managers, get your hands on this book - it predicts your doom and your salvation. Study it and you'll end up on the right side. We at getAbstract also suggest that students and investors read this book, which will leave you pondering whether it's predicting the future, or dictating it word-for-word.	2001-03-19

To survive in today's business environment, it's not enough to just keep improving - you have to do it faster than the other guy does. Brian L. Joiner provides valuable direction in how to get better faster. This approach transcends goal-based management by focusing on the needs of the customer. Only then do apparent contradictions between customer service and cost-cutting become manageable again. The author admits that the teachings of management guru W. Edwards Deming heavily influences his advice. We at getAbstract recommend this very helpful work to managers searching for a more enlightened, more effective approach. It will be particularly useful for those who need a strong rationale to do what they already think is right.	2001-03-19

Are you sick of the condescending tone of most Internet instruction books? Well, Jonathan Ezor has written the book for you. It focuses specifically on managing the risks involved in bringing your company online. Ezor uses Internet jargon, but he defines terms quickly and clearly. He doesn't sugarcoat the risks of the journey into cyberspace. Despite the risks, he shows that the effort is worthwhile because of the Internet's incredible potential for your company. We at getAbstract recommend this book to those who are bringing their companies online, and to those considering this step.	2001-03-16

This is a thoroughly engaging book about the world of financial speculation. Edward Chancellor discusses the origins of financial markets from the time of the Roman Empire through the modern Internet bubble. The book offers great insights about stock exchanges, outbreaks of speculation mania, and the fraud and greed that accompany any human endeavor. He presents in-depth reviews of many well-known \\"speculative manias\\" and several of the lesser-known ones. We at getAbstract recommend this book to anyone who wants a thoughtful treatment of a subject that touches all our lives.	2001-03-16

Yale University adjunct professor David F. DeRosa argues that markets are smarter than government ministries. Therefore, he contends, economic development should be left to the free market, since tighter regulations will only distort development. His detailed analysis of economic conditions focuses on factors leading to several crises, including the decline of the Mexican and Japanese economies in the 1990s and the Southeast Asian collapse of 1997. The subject is complicated and interesting, and the writing is often technical and sometimes complex. We at getAbstract call this book to the attention of scholars, executives and managers who have a serious interest in fiscal policy. And we do mean serious.	2001-03-16

You can improve your company's performance by increasing creativity and fostering employee innovation. Most creative acts are unexpected. Therein lies your company's creative potential. A company is creative when its employees do something new and possibly useful without being directly shown or taught. Creativity can and should happen in every organization, including companies with highly standardized procedures. While creativity is intangible, you can see the results of it in your company's improvements and innovations.<br />The first five chapters provide an overview of creativity, outlining the six essential elements that creativity requires. In the following chapters, the authors detail the six elements, provide several case studies to illustrate their points and show how to achieve each aspect of creativity. This is a useful book for any executive  who wants his or her company, and the people in it, to realize their full creative potential. We at getAbstract recommend this book to managers and executives in any industry.	2001-03-16

Curt Weeden tells corporations that social investing through charitable contributions can help society, and can be good business. Then he explains why, and how. This detailed guide explains ways to get the most out of each philanthropic investment, benefiting the non-profit organization and the company's reputation, employee motivation and bottom line. Weeden provides only a few examples of companies that have engaged in corporate social investing, but the introductions by Paul Newman and Peter Lynch are more hands-on because both are active in philanthropy. The book focuses on instructions for setting up your firm's social investing system. Suggestions cover choosing a non-profit recipient, figuring tax benefits, and other nuts-and-bolts issues. The book is oriented to CEOs and top corporate managers, though we at getAbstract also recommend it to academics, stockholders and fundraisers. If you are considering social investing, this is a good guide. And if you're not, it'll explain why you should. (Note: Tax matters discussed are	2001-03-16

Bell combines the practical with the heartfelt in a top-notch guide to creating a partnership with customers. He focuses on the elements of abundance, trust, dreams, truth, balance, and grace. The book uses intelligent and creative case histories and anecdotes to illustrate these essential components and, therefore, rises above the level of the basic how-to. The author pays close attention to intangible, human relationship concerns. The book is written well in an intimate, yet highly informative style. It weaves stories throughout each chapter. Although we at getAbstract recommend this book for people who deal directly with customers and people who supervise, manage, or lead others in a service-oriented business, the author correctly points out that the book's methods also can enhance anyone's professional and personal relationships.	2001-03-16

Their environmental passion is heartfelt, but the authors of Eco-Efficiency: The Business Link to Sustainable Development are no tree huggers. Livio D. DeSimone is chairman and chief executive officer of 3M and Frank Popoff is chairman of Dow Chemical. The co-authors' status as corporate titans lends credibility to their positions. The planet's fragile ecology is in danger of being destroyed by its inhabitants and large corporations bear much of the responsibility for saving the environment, they write. This isn't a screed, though. Rather, it's a reasoned guide to making your company more profitable and more environmentally friendly at the same time. The \\"eco\\" in their favorite buzzword, eco-efficiency, refers to both economics and the ecology. By examining their processes, companies can reduce waste that's costly financially and ecologically, they argue. Due to its measured, balanced analysis of the relationship between business and the environment, we at getAbstract strongly recommend this book to all executives and students, especially those who have a real concern for the environment, but find themselves frustrated at the strident tone of many environmentalists.	2001-03-16

In her latest respected work, futurist Hazel Henderson calls for a win-win world founded on cooperation, not domination. She provides a rich, fascinating, detailed, and thoroughly researched and cited look at the waning days of our current dysfunctional global paradigm. Then she looks ahead for a peek at the possible future of a new, healthier paradigm. Though it was justly well-reviewed, this book is not light reading. It is written in conversational language, but it has a scholarly depth and reach. It is a book to study, not flip through. Henderson calls for a complete redesign of every societal system imaginable - from economic and political to social and ethical - all with an eye toward sustaining a global economy and a more humane world view. We at getAbstract highly recommend this book to readers interested in economic, global, environmental, social, political, and ethical issues.	2001-03-16

Many rules and regulations govern pension plans. The technicalities are complicated and change constantly. People can make irrevocable errors doing something as simple as moving assets from one plan to another. Margaret A. Malaspina cuts through retirement plan red tape and explains the jargon. She shows you how to get to your money after you have worked hard to save it. This book demystifies your options and clarifies the consequences of your choices. The author makes reading about taxes relatively painless. We at getAbstract recommend this book to anyone planning retirement, switching retirement plans, or withdrawing retirement funds. However, because of its discussion of United States tax law, it is not useful to those in other countries.	2001-03-16

Morley take a fascinating trip into the future, the not-too distant future, by exploring what manufacturing and product delivery to consumers will look like in the year 2020. By discussing past and current advances, the authors articulately present convincing arguments for their ideas with great zest. Don't worry, you won't find impenetrable technological prose here, quite the contrary. Instead, you'll find visions of point-of-consumption manufacturing, small work groups made up of people who live near their job sites and biotechnology that enables customized creation of replacement body parts. Gene Bylinsky of Fortune magazine calls this well-received volume, \\"a beautifully written, insightful and important new book... your best guide to success\\" in the 21st century. We at getAbstract recommend this book to forward-looking managers who understand that, even in the complex future, the main rule will be: Keep it simple.	2001-03-16

The waning support among citizens for democratic institutions and their political leaders has been well documented in the United States in recent years. Now, academics analyzing global support for democracy have uncovered similar trends in other democracies. Mistrust of politicians, it seems, is becoming one of the universal values of the global village, according to this compilation edited by Pippa Norris. The book draws data from the World Value Survey, a unique, comprehensive survey of citizens of the world's democracies. By definition, democracies are made up of diverse interest groups, each clamoring for itself - so, is skepticism really a surprise, or unhealthy? More important, is it an indication that perhaps democracies are not as stable as you might hope? We at getAbstract recommend this book to those with an interest -  be it philosophical or commercial - in the growth and health of global democracies, and also note its specific interest to students of political science.	2001-03-16

According to Stephen and Donna Leeb, technological advances are slowing while global economies are pressured to maintain growth. These factors will combine to create an inflationary environment. Inflation will change investors' strategies. The authors suggest investing in oil stocks, small-cap companies, and a few select large-cap companies. They are intriguing contrarians. They assert that Internet companies are a poor investment, because they believe the Internet won't achieve its promised increase in productivity and efficiency. They warn that overpopulation will create environmental disasters, which investors should prepare for by how they invest. We at getAbstract recommend this thought-provoking advice to investors, though not as their sole source of guidance.	2001-03-16

The consultants he selected for this book represent the major stock investing approaches as growth, value or momentum investors. The interview format lets them speak for themselves. He briefly introduces the book with a primer on basic investment terms and principles, and a summary of major themes. We at getAbstract find the range of views shown very helpful, but note that the book suffers from overwriting and a lack of focus and editing. Some tightening would help highlight the main points in the long interviews. The introduction and conclusion are long and general, and a clearer, more detailed summary would be very welcome. Yet, the book offers a lot of information for the average serious investor, much of it straight from the mouths of some very important horses.	2001-03-16

Robert Pino uses the model of success in the martial art of aikido to show how corporations today can succeed. Aikido believes in winning without fighting and in gaining a victory over yourself. In business, that means concentrating on building your own strengths, rather than trying to launch an aggressive attack. You deflect attacks against you by neutralizing your competitor and taking over his power and energy. Pino discusses ways aikido's philosophy applies to the business world and gives examples of how major companies have used this approach. This interesting, original book suffers from two writing faults: occasional long, difficult-to-read sentences and repetition of the same ideas. Nonetheless, we at getAbstract recommend this book to those seeking new strategies for strengthening their organizations in a competitive marketplace.	2001-03-16

Ray Johnson analyzes the thought processes used by successful CEOs and breaks them down into a simple, step-by-step formula anyone can practice. Focusing on the fundamentals, this book is an excellent overview for any manager eyeing advancement, and can help average managers become extraordinary managers. Use it to help you identify the simple decisions that underlie the complex particulars of any given business situation. The organization of the book makes it easy to find information relating to specific disciplines, yet it flows smoothly if you want to read it cover to cover. This is not an academic book, but a practical one, which the author developed based upon 25 years of lessons learned while managing diverse public and private companies with annual revenues ranging from $5 million to $500 million. We at getAbstract recommend this book to managers at any level, especially those who are working hard toward a promotion.	2001-03-16

But when the words in question come from the pen of Microsoft's chairman, businesspeople and technophiles the world over rush to read them in search of whatever enlightening morsels might be hidden within. Indeed, the strength of this book, which sometimes reads like a Windows operating manual, is not in the grace of its prose. Rather, its value lies in the glimpse it gives of the world through the eyes of one of its richest and most influential men. As Gates sees it, the migration of data to the electronic state from paper was the seminal event of our age, and his book gives his take on its implications - hardly an irrelevant picture coming from the head of the world's dominant software company. We at getAbstract recommend this book to any executive charged with developing a digital strategy.	2001-03-16

The authors do an excellent job of providing comic relief at regular intervals, some of which works. The active, participatory style of this book makes it more engaging than other books in the motivational genre. Much of this vitality comes from the impressive amount of research that went into it. The authors reference well over one hundred books, magazines, and newspaper articles, bringing readers a lively cross-section of ideas. The book's simple failing: Few of these ideas are new. Nevertheless, we at getAbstract recommend Change Your Attitude as an entertaining book that covers all of the motivational standards.	2001-03-16

Karl Albrecht wrote this book for executives who want to implement a formal system for collecting strategic data. The book appears to present a scientific method, but it actually provides a collection of subjective tools or scans. An executive needs these scans to track the forces that shape business. This collection of subjective tools makes the book valuable. If you follow the author's system, you will be aware of or anticipate most events that have a potential impact on your business. The book is written in a very straightforward, direct style. The author uses contemporary examples to amplify his message.

Tony Alessandra focuses on how to build your charisma by analyzing the seven elements that comprise it: your \\"silent message,\\" speaking ability, listening skills, persuasive talent, use of time and space, adaptability, and vision. He provides a short quiz you can complete at the beginning of each chapter to identify easily which areas of your charisma need work. Allessandra believes that you don't have to be born with charisma, that anyone can increase his or her level of charisma. He demystifies it in this clearly focused, very readable book. Alessandra probably could write complete books on each of charisma's seven keys. In fact, the section on adaptability is essentially a summary of a book he co-authored, The Platinum Rule. But instead of seven volumes, here is one well-edited book packed full of content. We at getAbstract recommend this book to people who want to improve their charisma, or to understand the tangible aspects of this intangible quality.	2001-03-16

This thorough, detailed book focuses on the misunderstood aspects of merger and acquisition management. Timothy J. Galpin and Mark Herndon clearly have vast experience and draw on case studies to illustrate their suggestions. They provide sample surveys and integration flow charts to guide hands-on planning, and offer practical advice that you can apply in real-world situations. Not all of these ideas are new, nor do the authors claim them to be. Instead, they apply the most relevant ideas from management and psychology to M&amp;A. The authors hammer home an extremely consistent message: You must communicate. They present their ideas clearly, even though the book is often wordy and uses a lot of passive voice (alas, business prose). Nonetheless, this is actually a very dense book and the authors are careful not to waste the reader's time. This is essential reading for virgin M&amp;A managers, and we at getAbstract think that even experienced acquirers may find much to learn.	2001-03-15

Focusing on early Six Sigma advocates like GE and Allied Signal, the book provides a thorough account of the benefits and costs attached to Six Sigma and a practical guide to the many steps involved in its implementation. The authors offer little in the way of criticism, but that's hardly surprising, since the two men are top officers at Six Sigma Academy Inc. But what they lack in objectivity, they more than make up for in knowledge and experience, which show through as they describe how GE turned a $500 million Six Sigma investment into $750 million in savings. We at getAbstract recommend this book to any manager concerned with efficiency. And if you're not, you should be.	2001-03-15

Should we care about management consultants? And do they care about us enough to change the way they do business? For answers, turn to this well-researched, opinionated book by Ron A. Carucci and Toby J. Tetenbaum. The authors combine extensive survey data with their personal viewpoints to prove that management consulting needs serious repair. They present their model of the value-creating consultant as the solution. While some consultants may roll their eyes at the goal of forming an equal partnership with their clients, the book is on point about what is right and wrong with the profession. The authors explain the ways any consultant can use a value-creating model to improve client relationships. We at getAbstract recommend this excellent book to management consultants or anyone who needs to hire a management consultant. Executives, students and business owners will also find it thought-provoking, particularly if you think consulting is in your future.	2001-03-15

If you ever wondered how Bill Gates, Warren Buffet or even John D. Rockefeller got so rich, rest assured it took hard work and restless individualism. Martin S. Fridson profiles self-made billionaires and describes the principles and strategies they used to achieve their wealth. The profiles illustrate how these billionaires succeeded. Fridson identifies nine fundamental strategies, which become the basis for each of his chapters. His ideas may sound familiar - as may some of the stories he cites, such as the rise of Rockefeller and Bill Gates. However, Fridson combines these ideas and images compellingly, highlighting the major strategies and providing vivid portraits. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book to general readers, as well as executives, company owners and anyone who feels driven to get very, very rich.	2001-03-15

Chinese tech firm is an oxymoron, right? Not at all, according to this intriguing work by the late professor Qiwen Lu. This book, fascinating at times, offers an in-depth look at four successful Chinese tech enterprises. Taking each of the four as a case study, Lu thoroughly illustrates the challenges facing a bureaucracy attempting to break into a fast-changing industry. In spite of its good points, Lu's book isn't perfect. The text is laden with jargon, and at times it's difficult to understand exactly how these enterprises are organized. Still, there's plenty to like about this book. We at getAbstract recommend it to anyone interested in emerging economies, technology or international trade, or to anyone willing to have their expectations overturned.	2001-03-15

As demonstrated by the bankruptcies of Britain's Barings Bank and Orange County, Calif., any organization that dabbles in derivatives investments needs sophisticated risk-assessment tools like \\"Value at Risk.\\" The concept of VAR is simple - this single number shows just how much an institution's investment portfolio stands to lose. But calculating VAR is anything but simple, as author Phillippe Jorion's complex formulas and dense prose illustrate. Jorion does an admirable job of explaining exactly why Barings went broke, but his book is not for the uninitiated. Without skipping a beat, Jorion throws around impenetrable phrases like \\"generalized autoregressive heteroskedastic model.\\" Nevertheless, we at getAbstract recommend this necessarily complex book to money managers who need to gauge the downside of sophisticated derivative investments; the rest of us can simply peruse its intriguing sagas of financial disaster, take an aspirin and lie down.	2001-03-15

Fred DeLuca, the co-founder of the Subway submarine sandwich chain, describes his own experience and that of 21 other entrepreneurs who turned small businesses into big companies. He cites 15 success principles, using interesting \\"How I did it\\" stories from entrepreneurs to illustrate different axioms. While the book is an enjoyable read, the principles are familiar standards. The examples are easy-to-read accounts that describe how entrepreneurs try this and that, and finally find something that works. But, these are not really lessons you can apply, particularly given the broad nature of the guidelines they illustrate. That does not detract from getAbstract's recommendation of this interesting book, perhaps not as a step-by-step business manual, but as a fine set of stories about how a few small business owners made it to the top.	2001-03-15

Cusumano and David B. Yoffie have written a play-by-play of the competition between Netscape and Microsoft in an enormously detailed book that became an instant classic. Adding to the insider scoop, the authors take the opportunity to show readers how they can apply the \\"lessons\\" from this historic corporate battle to their own businesses in the context of today's fast-paced world, which runs on \\"Internet time.\\" Critically acclaimed, the book is filled with facts, figures, insights and strategies, and manages to do it all without drowning in tedium. We at getAbstract highly recommend this book to people in all business. It's exceptionally well written and flows like a good adventure saga, which it is. (getAbstract note: Despite its commendable Judo tactics, Netscape in late 1998 was acquired by America Online Inc. in a deal that was roundly viewed as a final victory for Microsoft in the browser war.)	2001-03-14

Globalization has become such an overused buzzword that it has become nearly devoid of meaning. Here, author Jay R. Galbraith injects new precision into the concept: Going international means plenty of hard work and painstaking attention to detail. Because every company's strategy, market and competitive advantage is unique, it's impossible to define one single, perfect, organizational structure for an international business, but Galbraith provides some fascinating alternatives to consider. Although Galbraith's book is jargon-filled and dense, it is full of useful, illustrative examples. He manages to reduce international business to its simplest form: A company develops an edge, and then tries to take it abroad. This involves many challenges, which Galbraith describes in rich detail. So if your company is multinational - or wants to be - we at getAbstract recommend this book to you. It is tailor-made for executives who are involved in international business - or who hope to expand their global reach.	2001-03-14

Chris and Reina Komisarjevsky illustrate effective management techniques using examples based on their toughest leadership experience: raising nine children. They delineate the skills that help children learn how to set goals, share objectives, communicate more effectively, and get along. Each chapter begins with a story about an experience with one of their children, such as buying ice cream or playing sandlot baseball. The stories illustrate management principles and guidelines. These precepts are very familiar, though linking them to child rearing is novel. Thus, the book serves as a nice, short recap of commonly known management and leadership principles, though we at getAbstract suspect that its treatment of the subject matter will probably be of more interest to managers who are parents as well.	2001-03-14

Greenleaf was widely revered for his profound impact on leadership theory during the last three decades of the 20th century. Eight of his most compelling essays on servant-leadership (a term he coined) are published here in book form for the first time. These essays testify to Greenleaf's legacy and to his important role in the philosophies of leadership and service. Issues of spirit, vision and wholeness are woven through many of these essays, which address individual and institutional leadership in all areas, including government, business, religion, education and philanthropy. We at getAbstract highly recommend this eloquent book to those contemplating or holding leadership positions.	2001-03-14

Schonberger, author of the critically acclaimed book, Japanese Manufacturing Techniques, which revolutionized American manufacturing theory and practices, now examines how world-class manufacturing techniques can be implemented by American corporations. This 1986 classic remains valuable, since manufacturing changes do not happen overnight, and plenty of companies are far from world-class in their approach to efficiency and productivity. Schonberger writes clearly, authoritatively and often amusingly, covering every element of world-class manufacturing in detail. We at getAbstract recommend this book for everyone involved in the manufacturing process, not just mangers and executives, but all employees who seek a context and a future for their work.	2001-03-14

Malone goes behind the myths about Apple Computers to present an in-depth history from Apple's start-up in 1976 to its decline through 1998. He emphasizes that the personalities of Apple founders, Steven Jobs and Steven Wozniak (or Woz), marked Apple's corporate culture with a kind of insaneness that made it great even as it contributed to the company's difficulties. He presents the two Stevens as deeply flawed individuals - one the creative, socially inept, technical genius, the other the narcissistic, untrustworthy tyrant. In places, Malone risks introducing distortions into the story in the interest of drama, especially when he imagines what Woz or Jobs might have been thinking or why they may have taken certain actions. Otherwise, we at getAbstract say sit down in your easy chair with this novelistic business history. Even those who are familiar with the broad outlines of the Apple story will find it fascinating.	2001-03-14

Lewis, an expert on cross-cultural and language training who has tutored clients from Swedish corporate executives to the Japanese Imperial Family, discusses the need to consider cross-cultural differences in managing any company in today's global world. He suggests a broad model you can use to characterize different national characteristics as linear-active, multi-active, and reactive. These traits shape attitudes toward time, leadership, team building, and affect a range of organizational behaviors. Lewis includes brief national profiles you can refer to when doing business away from home. This in-depth book covers common patterns in different cultures, and offers many examples of how different groups act under different situations. We at getAbstract recommend this book to top executives, managers and anyone who works in a multicultural business environment, as well as to general readers with a yen for informed people watching.	2001-03-14

Stimson Lectures Series)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A Good Read!	This slender, surprisingly thorough volume provides an insider's view of four region's storm-tossed financial crises (Latin America, '82, Mexico '94, Asia, '98 and Russia '98). Author Alexandre Lamfalussy, a key figure at the Bank for International Settlements during some of these crises, discusses the history of these events and the problems confronting crisis managers at the time. He lays out the critical background facts of each crisis and draws clear commonalties and contrasts among them. He also offers thoughtful, reasonable prescriptions for avoiding, minimizing and managing future crises. Then, he points out some little-discussed aspects of globalization in the developed world, which contributed to the crises. Though Lamfalussy's style is dense and somewhat academic, his content is worth the work. We at getAbstract recommend this book as valuable reading (and a financial lifejacket) for anyone doing business or investing in an emerging market, for corporate executives working abroad and for public policy makers worldwide.	2001-03-14

Aaker and Erich Joachimsthaler flex their marketing muscles in this exhaustive treatise on global brand creation. But although the authors clearly know an enormous amount about building the perfect branding campaign, their book suffers from a patina of academia that makes it read like a textbook. The book has a multitude of marketing insights to offer and it cites plenty of real-life business examples, so we at getAbstract think you'll gain much by sticking with it if you are in marketing or public relations. But the next time the authors expound on their methods for making products memorable, accessible and likeable, we hope they spare a tender thought for their own worthy book.	2001-03-13

Rarely does a book live up to the glowing blurbs on its front and back covers. This one does. James A. Autry, former president of Meredith Corp.'s Magazine Group (home of Better Homes &amp; Gardens, among others) has written a searingly honest, heartfelt, often amusing autobiography with plenty of insights into the business of journalism, business in general, corporate culture and what it takes to be a manager and a leader. Between chapters, Autry includes many of his poems (he's had two poetry books published). Many chapters include management advice from the wisdom that he's accumulated. His counsel rises above most of what you read in popular management and how-to books, and his writing style is lively, as one would expect from a former journalist and editor. We at getAbstract recommend this book to readers in all business areas and to anyone who wants an inside glimpse of the magazine industry, or of the real workings of high-level management.	2001-03-13

The second half of the 20th century was marked by the ebb and flow of government influence over national and international economies. Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw characterize the balance between government and private marketplace clout as a battle for the commanding heights of the economy. They trace this fight back to the years after World War II, where they discover that capitalism had been widely discredited and governments were basking in the glow of wartime victory. With descriptions of the catalytic people and events that moved markets and policy, Yergin and Stanislaw have turned an essentially academic topic into a readable book, which is as much about economics as it is about history. As engaging as the stories are, don't assume you're in for a light read. Many business books today have plenty of sizzle, but not much steak. We at getAbstract recommend that you sink your teeth into this big, juicy T-bone of a book, a rare treat for intellectual readers searching for economic adventure and substantive history.	2001-03-13

Jim Clark offers an adventurous account of the birth and volatile life of Netscape Communications Corp., the company that produced the Web browser that helped make the Internet a household tool. If the rags-to-riches dot-com start-up story has become clich&eacute;, bear in mind that when Netscape Navigator arrived on the market, the Internet was still largely the semi-private domain of a few academic oddballs. Due to the seminal role that Netscape played in turning the Internet into the omnipresent force that it is today, Clark's book does indeed represent an important first draft of history. The key phrase, of course, is first draft. If nothing else, Clark is a salesman and a promoter, and his goal here is to promote Netscape's version of history - a particularly important goal at a time when the U.S. courts are weighing the fate of the company's arch nemesis, Microsoft. Nevertheless, future historians will use this book in cobbling together the true tale of the Internet's origins, as well as the genesis of the stock mania of the late 1990s. We at getAbstract recommend this dramatic, and sometimes even suspenseful book, to all professionals, whose future decisions concerning the Internet will benefit from the de-mythologizing effect of historic perspective.	2001-03-09

Kathy Kristof has written the ideal manual for anyone mystified by the world of finance. Her clear, fact-filled book completely dispenses with the condescending tone and soothing jabber of most books in the how-to-invest genre. In their place, Kristof has compiled an enlightening compendium of elementary investment wisdom, lucid explanations of financial terms and instruments, and educational walk-thrus of stock-valuation techniques. Simply put: If you are not investing, you must read this book. Whether it's fear, ignorance or inertia that's keeping you out of the markets, Investing 101 will inspire you to put your money to work by revealing, in easy-to-understand language, exactly how it all really works. We at getAbstract recommend this book as required reading for any beginner investors, or to anyone who feels intimidated by a lack of financial knowledge.	2001-03-09

Beale offer readings, case studies and structured activities for developing individual and organizational diversity skills. The readings often focus on specific groups, but the underlying ideas can easily be extended to others. By focusing on the economic benefits of diversity management, the authors make a persuasive case that these ideas are strategically relevant, especially for companies that are trying to compete in the global economy. Some of the ideas are complex and take some real study, but they are presented clearly and concisely. The book offers little original research, but that is not the authors' goal. They mean to unite existing research and to put those ideas into action - a task that they perform very well. We at getAbstract recommend this book to human resource professionals, managers who must handle diverse workforces (especially executives who work outside their home country) and anyone struggling with diversity in the workplace.	2001-03-09

Tom Wolfe, an eloquent, if sometimes pessimistic, writer who deeply understands modern culture, wrote this massive, classic tale of greed, ambition and power. He casts the story of financier Sherman McCoy in the financial world of Wall Street, but includes the racial, political and economic issues of New York City in the early 1980s. Even 13 years after its publication date, this is still a gripping read. You can use this book as the starting point for reading about business culture from a fictionalized perspective. Or, you can combine it with Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker and The New New Thing, for insight from fact and fiction into the major episodes of greed and economic boom in the past 20 years. This undeclared trilogy examines the desire - not confined to Americans, though the books are U.S.-based - to achieve wealth at any cost. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book, all by itself, as a seminal volume in business fiction.	2001-03-09

Lewis uses the experiences of four major companies - Motorola, Philips Consumer Electronics Company, Marks &amp; Spencer and Chrysler - to show the benefits of creating an alliance with your suppliers. The book, which is thorough and complete, if a bit long-winded, explains the benefits of such customer-supplier alliances, shows how to get started if you want to form a partnership and spells out how to maintain the relationship. The obligatory tables and figures are conveniently listed right after the table of contents. If you are in a huge rush, you can skip the book and just read the tables, because you will probably get a condensed version of the same information. But we at getAbstract think you'll enjoy reading how these four companies fumbled through the awkward initial stages of customer-supplier alliances and then emerged into trend-setting, money-making success.	2001-03-06

Gerald Greenwald presents a personal account of his experiences as an executive at the Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and United Airlines and describes the lessons he learned along the way. He recounts some of the most interesting tales of corporate life in the United States, from the near collapse of Chrysler to airline labor conflicts, and uses these accounts to illuminate the failures and successes of different management styles. He discusses leadership lessons on how to motivate employees, inspire teamwork and improve communication. He writes, with the help of senior Chicago Tribune writer, Charles Madigan, in an engaging personal style that makes this an interesting read. Though we at getAbstract caution that some of Greenwald's lessons will be familiar, his congenial, thoughtful approach makes them excellent reminders of what works and what doesn't.	2001-03-06

Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson contend that some 50 million people, one-quarter of the population, in the United States belong to the same group - the \\"Cultural Creatives\\" - and share similar progressive, 1960s-rooted values, including environmentalism, social justice and women's equality. However, they say, these folks (two-thirds of them are women) are unaware of each other as members of the same cohort. They suggest that this group is prioritizing the search for meaning and authenticity over the quest for success. We at getAbstract wonder if the professors are oversimplifying a smidgen when they use their interviews and research to divide the U.S. population into three sets - \\"Cultural Creatives,\\" \\"Moderns\\" and \\"Traditionals\\". Could this be a bit sweeping, given the country's increasingly diverse population? Still, understanding sociological patterns helps you understand behavior and buying patterns, so as a businessperson you might find that any insight into how people are thinking is relevant - including this one.	2001-03-06

With literary assistance from journalist Scott Huler, Continental Airlines CEO Gordon Bethune describes how he transformed the near-bankrupt airline into one of the best companies in the industry. He describes the massive changes he made to improve the product, changing a low-cost, unreliable airline to a top competitor that emphasizes customer service. The transformations he brought about by exerting strong leadership reshaped financial controls and employee-supplier-creditor relationships. The book is a fascinating read, written in a straightforward, this-is-how-it-was style, typified by Bethune's characterization of the company he took over as a... \\"lousy\\" airline with terrible service. Sometimes he gets a little repetitious in summarizing the action at each new step in the transformation, but that's just a minor complaint about an otherwise excellent book.....	2001-03-05

Using enormous detail and plenty of case studies, John L. Nesheim presents a step-by-step plan for starting a new high tech company. Given the abundance of insider insights, his guidebook could be a critical part of your training if you are contemplating such a venture. (Although in light of the current atmosphere for new tech ventures, you might want to reconsider altogether.) But after reading this book, you'll at least know what you're getting yourself into before you make that first call to your newly acquired corporate attorney. Nesheim designed his book, also, to be informative for venture capitalists and corporate development managers who work with new ventures. Nesheim backs up his authoritative tone with plenty of facts and figures (updated in this year 2000 second edition) So, if that pregnant gleam in your eye relates to a bouncing, baby tech firm, we at getAbstract.com recommend this book as an essential part of your planning process, with the caveat that times have changed for start ups since this book went to press.	2001-03-02

If you own stock in SAP, perhaps the world's premier producer of the enterprise software that integrates such business functions as finance, distribution and human resources, this year's been a wild ride. But despite this patch of management problems, earnings pressure and roller-coaster stock price fluctuations, SAP remains one of the largest and most firmly entrenched software companies in the world. Gerd Meissner attributes much of this success to the corporate culture established at SAP's birth by its five German founders, and in more than 200 compelling pages, he proves his point by piercing the veil of this innovative and secretive organization. Meissner traces the history of the company back to its origins in the early 1970s, keeping his finger always on the thread of characteristics that set SAP apart from its competitors - for better or for worse. We at getAbstract.com strongly recommend this book both as a gripping biography of an industry giant and as an incisive study in employee empowerment, business alliances and corporate innovation. In other words, in reading this book, not only will you learn something about this thriving software company, you'll probably learn something about your own company as well.	2001-03-02

Tichy make the case that no company, even a very large corporation, should think of itself as a mature company or as part of a mature industry. If you look at the market broadly and take your customer's perspective, you will always find room for growth. First, look at your customers' changing needs and think of how your company can expand beyond its current market. Then, expand that approach throughout the company. The basic message may sound familiar, but Charan and Tichy bring a strong how-to approach to their directions for implementing it in your company.

Pierpont Morgan's life and times as a preeminent financier during the expansion of the American economy in the late 1800s and early 1900s. She details the deals he engaged in to raise capital in Europe, help the railroads overcome bankruptcy, and provide bonds and loans to clients. She also details his role in working with other financial leaders and government officials to stabilize markets and - at a time when the U.S. had no national bank - to set up many of the corporate and financial structures we now take for granted. We at getAbstract.com were particularly interested in Strouse's descriptions of the political, economic, and social history of each period as a backdrop for Morgan's life. Morgan comes alive in her descriptions of his family life, travels, and art collection. This excellent, comprehensive biography will intrigue executives, managers, historians and anyone who appreciates war stories about a master dealmaker.	2001-03-02

Author Gary Rivlin presents an in-depth, if not completely objective, look at Bill Gates' hard-nosed take-no-prisoners approach to battle. He follows Gates' campaign to create a software empire and annotates the enemies he made along the way. The book reads like a novel as Rivlin traces Gates' beginnings in Washington, where he first became fascinated by computers. Early on, Gates strategically manipulated everyone, even his partners, so that he was in charge and got the best of the deal. Rivlin cuts away some of the myths about Gates being a skilled program developer; from the beginning Gates was first and foremost a businessman with dreams of mastery. We...recommend this excellent, engaging book that will have broad appeal. As you follow the drama of Gates' behind-the-scenes maneuverings, stay alert for the business strategy lessons along the way.	2001-03-01

McQuown provides a hands-on guide to setting up your own corporation, using several different U.S. corporate formats, including an S Corporation, C Corporation and a limited liability company (LLC). After briefly describing the pros and cons of different approaches, she focuses on the basic steps to take, including samples of filled-in tax forms, guides to creating a business plan, information on getting loans and helpful resources, complete with Web addresses. This excellent basic guide is primarily directed toward the entrepreneur starting a business, or to independent contractors or professionals earning at least $50,000 a year. We at ... admire the specificity and utility of this information, but notes that it may not be relevant to executives, except those with separate side businesses, or to entrepreneurs outside the U.S., since the self-incorporation regulations discussed apply only in the United States.	2001-03-01

Our lives have speeded up, a phenomena that affects both individuals and society according to author James Gleick. He describes examples of speed's impact in chapters that read like separate essays on different aspects of life. He covers the acceleration in machines, in books, in advertising, in attention span and so on. Ironically, his book is written in a very leisurely, reflective, pop-sociology or pop-history style that takes its time in exploring different historical developments leading to the speed up of life today. This is an observation, not a criticism, since we at getAbstract.com find that his book provides an engaging, compelling look at these changes in society. While many of these changes - such as the explosion of new technologies over the last ten years - will seem very familiar, Gleick's broad view of these developments offers executives, managers and general readers a new context for understanding them, if you can slow down long enough to read it.	2001-02-28

Author Lisa Endlich begins her saga about Goldman Sachs, one of the world's premier investment banks, with its unexpectedly modest roots and leads readers through an enlightening history of the firm, enhanced by her sharp eye for telling details. For instance, she describes partner Bob Rubin's tattered briefcase to illustrate the understatement favored at the firm. Yet Endlich, a former Goldman Sachs trader, isn't the clear-eyed observer that a journalist might be. She doesn't shy away from the difficult parts of Goldman Sachs' history, but she does sacrifice a bit of credibility by expecting her readers to swallow the firm's \\"client-always-comes-first\\" party line. And who ever heard of an ego-less banker? At Goldman no less! Despite Endlich's obvious adoration of the firm, we at getAbstract.com strongly recommend this book for its penetrating glimpse into the largely sequestered world of Wall Street investment banking. (getAbstract note: This book's narrative leaves off just prior to Goldman's 1999 initial public offering.)	2001-02-28

Books	5	2	3	N	N	Packed With Knowledge!	Tom Peters strikes again, with this segment of his trilogy on the changing nature of work. This is required reading for anyone who wants to know why there is no security in the workplace anymore and who would like to know what to do - right now - about this new precariousness. Peters takes the reader through 50 distinct yet imminently interrelated thoughts about work as it truly exists in the era of globalization, technology, computers and the Internet. He maintains that only those white-collar workers who brand and \\"Inc.\\" themselves will survive the changes that he anticipates in the next 15 years. As Tom himself says, the revolution has started, it is time to get on board. Given that call to arms, we at getAbstract.com recommend this book to everyone, executives, managers, employees, students and retirees. It is a seminal book on the future of work and workers.	2001-02-28

This riveting page-turner reads like a financial thriller and is all the more compelling for being true. Author Roger Lowenstein has a knack for establishing character quickly and capturing the way that ego, hubris and Wall Street's herd mentality came together to create a crisis that threatened a global financial meltdown unseen since the Great Depression, or perhaps never seen at all. At a time when markets have assumed an unprecedented stature, this is a powerful cautionary tale for financial professionals and those who idolize them. Lowenstein's clear analysis shows that little has changed since the heyday of Long-Term Capital Management. In other words, brace yourself, because the conditions that made this crisis possible still exist. We at getAbstract.com put this book on the required reading list for investors, money managers, bankers and policymakers who are pondering the proper extent of regulation and financial oversight.	2001-02-26

Stross, a business history teacher, describes how Benchmark's team of six venture capitalists made their decisions and provided recruitment and management support to some billion-dollar Internet start-ups. Written like a novel, this saga focuses on two of Benchmark's star investments: eBay and Webvan. Stross did some heavy lifting in the reporting department, including extensive interviewing and sitting in on meetings and conversations. He combines general observations about venture capital practices with dialogue from decision-making meetings. The book is best when it focuses on a few of the selected companies that Benchmark backed, since sometimes the detail and dialogue become too vague. We at getAbstract.com think general readers might like this narrative even more than executives and managers, who might find it a little casual, disjointed and diffuse if they are looking for specific insights about venture capital decisions. Oh, and one more thing: Since the book's publication, Webvan stock, which debuted at $34 per share, has plummeted to less than 50 cents per share. Ouch!	2001-02-26

You read the manifestos, the prophecies and the change-or-die ultimatums. Now read the postmortem. George Colombo begins his dissection of the dotcom corpse by stating the now obvious: Many Internet companies didn't offer viable business plans, the Internet stock boom was mostly hysteria, and the average Internet start-up had no clue how to acquire or serve customers. But picking through the carnage, he identifies elements of the dotcom business model that are worth salvaging. In clear, spare prose he explains how businesses can blend brick-and-mortar operations with electronic innovations like permission marketing and mass customization to capture long-term customers - the key to success in a market of hyper-informed and fickle consumers. We at getAbstract.com strongly recommend this book to any and all professionals, especially those left wondering what's to become of their vaunted Web strategies in the post-dotcom era.	2001-02-23

Champion sailor Peter Isler (with help from business writer Peter Economy) shows how victory in sailing's America's Cup race demonstrates lessons that can be applied to success in business. The same practices that contribute to winning the sailing race also lead to business triumphs. Isler distills the principles of good sailing into seven key rules. These fairly familiar rules include making a total commitment, creating a strong team effort, being ready to change, leveraging every opportunity to your advantage, expecting the unexpected, pushing the limits and having the right inner attitude. However, the parallels between sailing and business make the book especially interesting, as do Isler's compelling examples from his sailing experiences. He also includes apt quotes from other sailors with business backgrounds. We at getAbstract.com (who are bravely resisting the urge to make ocean-going puns here) recommend this book not only to top executives, but also to general business readers, especially those who like sailing. Ahoy.	2001-02-23

When British explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton was busy saving his crew after a shipwreck in the Antarctic in 1914, you would guess that he wasn't thinking much about teaching leadership lessons. But author Dennis N.T. Perkins uses Shackleton's expedition to show how the leadership principles the explorer exercised can be applied to your work. He even adds modern case studies as illustration. This excellent book is at its best when it describes Shackleton's courageous rescue. He led his men to safety through a frozen wilderness by focusing on the ultimate goal of survival, setting a personal example, overcoming conflict, minimizing status differences, stressing teamwork and applying other essential leadership qualities. Though the principles may sound familiar, the book provides a dramatic new view of them, and it is written in a clear, crisp style. We at getAbstract.com recommend it to all corporate explorers.	2001-02-23

It reads as if the author and her editors decided that if the majority of home office workers could not use a secret, it would not make the book. The book's only glaring problem is minor: two tips are identical (numbers 29 and 72: create a Web site). Fortunately, Kanarek followed her own advice (Tip #102 \\"Always give more than expected\\"), so readers expecting 101 secrets will not feel shortchanged...our tip is that this book is required reading for anyone working from home.	2001-02-23

The name Nordstrom is synonymous with excellent customer-service. This book highlights what the Nordstrom department store chain does differently from its competitors to ensure that customers consistently receive superior service. This inside look is fascinating reading for anyone interested in the retail industry. Front line employees will be able to use some of the Nordstrom techniques, no matter where they work. In fact, people in almost every industry can use the customer-service practices described by the authors. Anecdotal evidence of the success of these practices makes this book easy to read and very enjoyable. Readers will learn the Nordstrom story from its humble beginnings at the turn of the 20th century, as the Wallin &amp; Nordstrom shoe store, to its current status as a retail powerhouse. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book not only to anyone in the retail sector, but to anyone in customer-service. This is what good service looks like, and this is how to make money with it.	2001-02-23

Self-help books tend to be either insightful or dumb. Author Ann Marie Sabath manages to accomplish both results in the same book. At times, the book provides useful examples on topics that are truly unclear, but other times it tells you to wear your goulashes in the snow. If you are willing to shift through some incredible obviousness, then you will find enough pearls. The lists of common mistakes that start each chapter are particularly helpful. If you do nothing else, read these lists and find out if you are committing a dressing gaff. If you can honestly say that you have not or never will commit any of the mistakes on the lists then you are ready to navigate the business casual workplace confidently.	2001-02-23

This thorough, scholarly study balances broad concepts with specific details of the history of finance from the 15th through 20th centuries. Though authors Jonathan Barron Baskin and Paul J. Miranti Jr. assume that the reader has some knowledge of finance and relevant terms, they avoid mathematical models and jargon in favor of plain language. Their book is accessible and valuable to lay readers as well as trained economists, historians, students of finance and anyone coping with an emerging market. The issues they examine remain surprisingly relevant, because - as they soon make clear - the problems that historical markets once confronted are the same issues of risk and information that markets face today, particularly emerging markets. As a historical study, this book presents no particular prescriptions for success or future action. However, we at getAbstract.com recommend its explanation of why some structures succeeded and others failed, because those forces have clear implications today.	2001-02-23

Definitely designed more like a textbook than a manifesto, this volume bills itself as the only supervisory training book you'll ever need to deal with today's issues and skills. Consultants Brad Humphrey and Jeff Stokes' punctuate their book with illustrative graphs, chapter wrap-up questions and lots of notes in highlighted bold type. Their tone of voice would fit well into many classrooms as well as corporate offices. This wide-ranging book covers the basics and offers very complicated productivity analysis, worker evaluation protocols and even an initial primer on how computer applications can help your productivity. For the manager or supervisor who's just testing the deep waters of management theory, we... recommend this fairly easy first step into the deep end. The authors suggest that an organization's supervisors should all read a chapter and then deal with the questions and exercises in a discussion group. That's the supervisory skill equivalent of \\"Okay, everybody in the pool!\\"	2001-02-23

Authors Des Dearlove and Stephen Coomber present capsule biographies of 50 individuals who have played a major role in the spread of e-business. Besides providing some background on each person, these bios highlight their major contributions as individuals or through their companies. While many names and stories are familiar - Jeff Bezos, Larry Ellison, Bill Gates - others are less so, such as the developers of Google and Real Networks. The bios mix high-tech contributors, entrepreneurs and journalists covering the e-business revolution. Though the book has a brief introduction, it suffers from its alphabetical listing of the contributors, which presents the bios out of context. We at getAbstract.com say this book \\"coulda been a contender\\" if it grouped its bios in chronological order or by field, and offered introductions to local sections of that nature. Still, it's a useful encyclopedia of the selected individuals and a valuable e-resource.	2001-02-23

If The Art of War graces your shelf, this book is for you. Author Nick Skellon argues that you can apply military lessons to corporate strategy. His theories make for fascinating reading. For instance, he draws parallels between the pitched head-to-head combat of the American Civil War and Burger King's battles with McDonald's. Like the Persians harassing the larger Roman forces with raids in 359, Honda attacked Harley-Davidson in the United States in the 1960s by grabbing the clean-cut college kids that Harley avoided. Sure, Skellon stretches the analogy too far, and by the time he gets to case studies such as Wal-Mart, there's barely a hint of military jargon. Still, we at getAbstract.com recommend this intriguing look at corporate successes and failures to readers who realize that brilliant strategy is brilliant strategy, whether on the battlefield or in business.	2001-02-23

In this well-documented, well-reasoned report, he describes the breakdown in the Soviet economy. This collapse was already in the works when Gorbachev's efforts to reform the system brought it tumbling down. Gustafson weaves his account together like a journalist, as he discusses the heady rush of capitalism, entrepreneurism, political corruption and crime that moved into Russia's economic vacuum like a modern gold rush. He carefully traces recent developments in Russia's attempt to recover from its 1998 financial disaster.<br />As the book describes, no one knows what will happen in Russia. Gustafson emphasizes that Russia cannot return to its command economy. The book offers cautious optimism for future business with Russia. However, the admitted uncertainty of Russia's future may frustrate readers who seek definitive answers. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book to readers interested in social and political developments and to academics as well as to executives of companies with economic interests in Russia, or those who may want to do future business there, although - for now - it may be a particularly risky venue.	2001-02-20

Daniels is not afraid to challenge some popular management theories. He even mentions in his preface that &quot;human performance has been trivialized by many books, the popular press and management folklore. The author uses behavioral analysis as an approach to managing people. This systematic, data-focused method is concerned with measurable results, not subjective qualities like &quot;improved teamwork&quot; or &quot;better employee morale.&quot; We at getAbstract.com recommend this book for managers who are interested in initiating change in a precise controlled fashion.	2001-02-20

It's tough to pick up a magazine or turn on the television these days without someone telling you that you must turn your company into an e-company in order to survive. But once you get past these exhortations to \\"embrace change,\\" it's surprisingly hard to find any practical advice on how to integrate e-commerce into your company's business plan. Therein lies the value of Faisal Hoque's e-Enterprise, which disposes of generalities and plunges headlong into an explanation of online business models, applications, architecture and tools. For the technologically challenged, this book will go down like castor oil. But if you are running a business - any business - Hoque's exhaustive blueprint to creating a true e-business will be exactly the right medicine. For that reason, we at getAbstract.com implore executives and managers to bite the techie bullet and read this book, which also will satisfy even the hardest-core geeks with its encyclopedic guide to the components that constitute the building blocks of the e-Enterprise.	2001-02-16

Jane Applegate's book is an idea journal for the budding entrepreneur. No one business can use all these ideas, every business owner will be able to use a few of the ideas Applegate mentions. Some of her great ideas are specific to a single type of business. Other ideas sound fine, but deal with areas that are difficult for an entrepreneur to control. The book's big drawback is that it lacks an over-reaching strategy. It is a set of disconnected ideas, which makes it more useful as a brainstorming tool than as anything you would use as the basis of a business. It doesn't tell you how to create a marketing plan, but it gives you marketing ideas you can incorporate into the plan you develop.

Cairo discuss how to use action coaching to improve individual effectiveness and boost your overall organization. Their approach begins with fostering self-awareness and then uses this awareness to motivate change that the organization needs. Action coaching involves a series of steps and some specific coaching tools. While this book provides a fairly well-organized and well-written introduction to the concept, it covers familiar training and development ground. If you are a beginner in this area, the repetition of steps and processes will come in handy. Experienced trainers will find the coaching tools quite familiar and the assessment questions fairly obvious.

If you work in human resources, the manual put together by editors Richard A. Swanson and Elwood F. Holton III will probably find its way onto a shelf close by your desk, where it can be easily reached as a reference tool. The chapters of this book, which were written by different authors but have been organized into a logical whole, help span the gap between theory and practice in the human resources field. You'll likely find yourself reaching for this dense, informative book every time your start planning a survey, training program or research project. If you're not in HR, this book is more likely to find its way into cardboard box on a dusty shelf at the back of a dark closet. The content, although quite innovative and detailed, is simply too specialized for a general readership. Therefore, we  recommend this book to human resource professionals at all levels, and strongly encourage students of the discipline to study these pages before setting out in the real world of business.	2001-02-16

Author Karen Southwick reveals how a few kids from Stanford University turned Sun Microsystems into a $10 billion industry powerhouse. This incredibly detailed book revisits many of the key moments in Sun's history, leading up to the recent excitement over the Java programming language. The author shows how Scott McNealy's unique personal style played an instrumental part in Sun's direction. Despite McNealy's prominence in the book, this is really a saga about Sun Microsystems and the technology economy. While she makes some effort to provide McNealy's biography, the author is clearly more interested in the strategic corporate moves Sun made to position itself for the future. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book as essential reading for anyone in the early stages of a technology start-up, and fascinating reading for anyone even slightly interested in business.	2001-02-16

Action Learning in Action Action learning has been around since the 1930s, but it can be used to improve organizations today. Michael J. Marquardt shows how. Basically, four to eight people work together to solve a problem, reflect on what they learn as they proceed and then implement their solution. Marquardt offers a clear step-by-step process and a few case histories. His focus on the original methodology may be a little heavy, but he aims to distinguish action-learning groups from multi-problem-oriented teams and work groups. The book is well organized, but if you already know about team building, leadership development and learning organizations, you'll be walking on familiar ground. That's why we at getAbstract.com recommend this book either to those who are so immersed in group learning that they find new nuance in everything in the field, or to those who are fresh to the subject, who will benefit particularly from the helpful charts, lists and illustrations.	2001-02-16

Books on corporate outsourcing generally reflect one of two themes: Outsourcing is either the ultimate answer to all your strategic worries or it's the ultimate evil. Maurice F. Greaver II leaves little doubt about which camp he belongs to in his boosterish review of the outsourcing process. The fact that the author is an unabashed outsourcing proponent takes nothing away from this comprehensive overview of an important business trend. Greaver achieves a feat that most strategists-turned-writers do not even strive for: He quickly disposes of the why and gets right to the how. Outsourcing can be a complex, controversial and sometimes painful practice. This book will tell you how to approach it, how to implement it, and how to proceed once it's in place. The book does have a couple of shortcomings: It's heavy with jargon and it doesn't provide enough detail about how managers should address employees dissatisfaction, which is arguably the biggest hurdle an outsourcing company must clear. Despite these weaknesses, the book is an impressive work, which we at getAbstract.com recommend to executives, managers, employees and students.	2001-02-16

This cheerful and snappy little book offers a host of helpful suggestions for using your time and talents. You will appreciate Alan Axelrod and Jim Holtje's humor, practicality, and common sense. Their advice - which applies to people at all organizational levels - ranges from planning timely and productive meetings to using the telephone wisely. They also discuss voice-mail etiquette, the best way to start your day, travel tips, and how to improve your reading speed and skills. You will benefit from the suggestions for managing your personal time, too. Supervisors can use this book to help their employees manage time more skillfully. The book is short and to the point, and happily devoid of verbosity. We at getAbstract.com recommend it as a text that will help you save time, calm frustrations, increase efficiency, multiply successes, impress others, and please yourself.	2001-02-16

This beautiful work appeals to the part of you that is creative and artistic, the part that is always searching for new ways to look at the world. The book begins with a poem. The themes that follow - play, organization, self, emergence - each spin from the poem. The authors, Margaret J. Wheatley and Myron Kellner-Rogers, weave in their bold, thought-provoking views on how life seeks to organize and diversify itself out of chaos. They explore scientific concepts by Charles Darwin, Carl Sagan and other scientists, interspersing quotes from mystics and philosophers. This is an excellent book, the kind you might keep on your desk to share or on your night stand for inspiration. The loose, circular writing elegantly expresses both philosophical and scientific ideas about organization. It is soulful without being too wishy-washy. ... .	2001-02-16

Keshavan Nair emphasizes the need for leadership based on a fundamental moral standard, as taught and lived by Mohandus Gandhi. The Indian leader embodied a moral life centered on truth, non-violence and service to others. Nair argues that business leaders today need to follow these basic principles. He stresses that these principles - and the practices based upon them - make good business sense in the long run, as well as being crucial to the survival of society. The text combines Gandhi's experiences with Nair's exhortations on how to apply these principles in the workplace. However, Nair provides few examples of contemporary leaders who practice these principles. Thus, the book occasionally comes across as somewhat preachy, wishful, overly idealistic and out of touch with the everyday realities of business. Yet, we at getAbstract.com recommend it in the face of those realities as a counterbalance, as well as a good quick read that encourages thought.	2001-02-16

John Guaspari uses a murder mystery - Who killed the consultant? - to set up his explanation of the value effect and its power. While value effect adherents at a corporate retreat are busy devising strategies to serve customers by employing the fundamentals of human nature, the consultant gets whacked. But who did it? The guilty party is someone from the corporate department that is most threatened by the use of the value effect. Do we have a human resources murderer or a marketing manslayer? Trying to figure out the mystery adds some fun to this business saga, which we at getAbstract.com recommend while applauding the author's originality in creating a corporate thriller. His book is a cut above the usual \\"next big thing\\" pomposity, even if the main CVC concepts described within will sound distressingly familiar to readers of management theory. (By the way, if you don't care about who done it, but are curious about CVC, the value effect itself is skillfully summarized in a concluding memo.)	2001-02-16

While there's certainly no shortage of hype about the Internet, there is a scarcity of clear, effective information about how companies are executing successful Web strategies. If you're confused about how to carve a niche on the Internet, or if you're overwhelmed by the complexity of the dauntingly dubbed \\"e-commerce initiative,\\" An IBM Guide to Doing Business on the Internet offers a helpful starting point. With concrete examples and clear language, author Kendra R. Bonnett takes readers through a link-by-link plan for launching an effective Web site. She dutifully defines jargon and appropriately focuses on customer needs. As a result, this book won't appeal to hard-core geeks, but it does have plenty to offer readers whose Internet knowledge is at the novice or intermediate level. We at getAbstract.com recommend An IBM Guide to Doing Business on the Internet to executives who, when it comes to the Internet, just don't quite get it - but want to.	2001-02-16

Brian Tracy provides a clearly structured, easy-to-use manual for salespeople. He writes in a very common-sense style, objectively describing what works in sales, and what doesn't. Tracy makes it easy for you to recognize faults in your selling strategies, but doesn't leave you feeling like you are personally to blame. While Tracy admits that it's possible to succeed without changing some of the faults he identifies, he makes it clear that with correction, any salesperson will become even more successful. He offers excellent, specific, concrete actions you can take to improve your sales ability. We ... recommend this book to novice salespeople as well as to experts who want a refresher. Novices will be able to plan a career sales strategy, while veterans still will learn one or two things that could put them over the top. This is a perfect book for sales managers to buy for members of their sales force.	2001-02-16

Don't be put off by this book's daunting terminology. Beneath the author's unrestrained use of labels like universalism, particularism, individualism, communitarianism, specificity and diffuseness, lies an insightful analysis of cultural differences. After defining various nationalities under a host of polysyllabic headings, authors Charles M. Hampden-Turner and Fons Trompenaars illustrate the differences between them using engaging and easy-to-understand scenarios and stories from popular culture. The end goal of each of these sections is to explain to international business managers how cultural dilemmas can be reconciled.	2001-02-16

This fascinating book balances thorough academic scholarship (every reference is detailed, in the manner of scientific texts) with practical information for entrepreneurs and investors. The subject matter is among the most critical areas facing the \\"New Economy.\\" Understanding and finding equity investors is vital as more and more people are challenged to take charge of their own fate and become entrepreneurs. This book bills itself as the first serious examination of the \\"business angel\\" capital market, and so it fills a critical need. Its suggestions are presented in plain, emphatic language and both investors and entrepreneurs should find it straightforward - though not necessarily easy - to implement them. The authors even manage to slip in some appropriate humor along the way. Their preface says this book should be read by anyone who is considering starting a firm, considering investing in a firm, seeking investors in a firm or considering an IPO for a firm.	2001-02-16

Training professionals are shifting their focus from teaching to improving the performance of individuals and organizations. Dana Gaines Robinson and James C. Robinson have compiled a series of articles by members of the Association for Training and Development that approach this trend from varying angles. The common theme is identified at the start: Trainers are becoming performance consultants, working with companies to improve business performance, learning and work environments. After presenting this foundation, the book traces it through organizational partnering, performance change, large and small departmental organization, and employee alignment. The book serves up a feast of charts, examples, lists, chapter highlights and a profile on each author. It is written for the instructional designer, organizational development consultant, training manager, performance consultant and other specialists. Thus, non-trainers will find it jargon-laden and inaccessible. The multiple authors generate some overlap, but otherwise we  recommend this exploration of training's new focus - the bottom line of performance - to everyone in the field.	2001-02-16

Drawing this blueprint to the digital economy required the combined labors of three editors (Don Tapscott, Alex Lowry and David Ticoll) and various expert authors drawn from academia, research and corporate leadership. The 20 essays that make up the book focus on industrial transformation, new rules for competing in the e-age, the computer-based network model and changes in government structure and policy in a networked world. The high-level authors contribute thoughtful articles, though some ideas overlap and some thick spots of techie language and academic theorizing emerge along the way. More problematic, since the e-commerce environment changes so quickly, the book has a slight air of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Its discussion of emerging trends freezes in flight and becomes a kind of fluid history of a particular time in e-business' evolution. Still, we recommend this book - for the fascinating movement it captures - to the general reader interested in business- and information-age topics and to top managers.	2001-02-16

How did the modern United States get so rich? Robert Sobel presents an overview of American history from the end of World War II to the present, focusing on the economic, social, and technological developments that built wealth in America. The book is an engaging read, especially for anyone who grew up in the early '40s or '50s. Sobel, a professor of business history, wrestles a mass of historical data to the ground, though he sometimes daunts the reader with long, complex sentences or over-ambitious clumps of information. The book unfolds thematically, sometimes skipping about chronologically, so you might wish for charts or graphics that clarify time frames and supplementary material. You'll get over that, as you become absorbed in this otherwise excellent, thoughtful book, which getAbstract.com recommends for its skillful weaving of familiar historical facts and insightful analysis.	2001-02-16

Jerry B. Harvey, a professor of management science, offers a series of essays on various management topics, such as backstabbing, betrayal, deception and work environments. To make his points, he uses a kind of discursive, reflective approach that includes a mix of stories, fables, metaphors and considerations of language usage. Some might find his approach a refreshing narrative, complete with the feel of discovery you'd get from reading someone's diary. Others may find that the essays ramble and repeat themselves. We at getAbstract.com agree more with the first line of thinking. However, we do post the cautionary note that - although Harvey raises some generally unmentioned, intriguing issues in the politics of management - he does need to be more concise. In other words, perhaps he could have used that knife in his back to trim his prose a little.	2001-02-16

Technological advances and the development of innovative financial instruments have given finance pros the ability to measure and control risks that in past generations were impossible even to isolate and identify. The limits and dangers of this new capacity have already been displayed in several financial crises in the late 1990s, in which highly touted risk management tools fell short of expectations, costing the firms that relied on them billions of dollars. Against this backdrop, James T. Gleason's lucid dissection of the evolution and potential of risk management is an invaluable resource. Gleason lays out how current risk management practice came to be, identifies types of risk and the tools that are being used to control them, and lays out a framework for implementing global risk management strategies. Though much of the writing presupposes a basic knowledge of finance, we at getAbstract.com recommend Risk to experts, who will benefit from the book's historic perspective, and lay people, who will be enlightened to one of the most important concepts of the 21st century economy.	2001-02-16

Owen Harrison is no longer just the man who wrote the book on Open Space Technology &#8212; He&#8217;s now the man who wrote the books. Expanding Our Now is Harrison&#8217;s second crack at explaining the organizational theory he developed after watching a celebration in an African village. Basically the theory boils down to this: A group will organize itself to solve a specific problem if you sit everyone in a circle and get out of the way. The nuts-and-bolts of this process were described in Harrison&#8217;s earlier, Open Space Technology: A User&#8217;s Guide. This time around, the author gives us a bit more history and theory. Your reaction to this book will depend to a large extent on how ready you are to accept OST as a concept and how open to new management techniques you are in general. But even if you&#8217;re not in the market for newly minted organizational theories, we at getAbstract.com recommend that you read this book, if only to absorb some of its innovative suggestions about how to get the most out of that bane of corporate life &#8212; the meeting.	2001-02-16

The biggest management secret is that managers know who is not producing and they know what isn't working, and they don't do anything about it. And why not? John H. Zenger argues that shameless managers know productivity is lagging. Every day, says he, managers deliberately overlook people and conditions that limit productivity. While he scolds such oversight, he also offers a cure. Managers must wake up and attend to reversing unproductive trends in their work places. By eliminating bureaucracy, streamlining processes, and giving employees the skills to do excellent work, managers can incite a productivity revolution. This sure-handed, action-oriented guide provides direct suggestions and ready-to-use tools. True to its word - that bigger is not better - this short book will help managers transform their work environments into places where things get done and quickly. If you want to work in, or manage, a place like that, we recommend this book to you.	2001-02-16

In light of the recent declines in tech stocks, you must give author Karen Southwick credit - for the most part she's profiled companies that are still around, although they've taken some hits. Southwick synthesizes her observations of Silicon Valley over the last decade or so. She takes a broad and sustained look at the practices of such companies as Ascend, Audodesk, Ciena, Cisco, Crossworlds, Net Noir, Open Market, Peoplesoft, Yahoo and others. Using an anecdotal, feature-story style, Southwick dissects these firms, covering CEOs' personal histories, corporate funding and corporate culture - down to dress code and wilderness team-building exercises. Some stories aren't new (insiders know Yahoo's culture is wacky) and there are some small inaccuracies (i.e. you could challenge Crossworlds CEO Katrina Garnett's argument that turnover is still a massive problem). Nonetheless, whether you're an insider or just an observer seeking an overview of Silicon Valley and its players, we at getAbstract.com recommend this accessible, reader-friendly compilation.	2001-02-16

Imagine how effective your marketing would be if you had individual relationships with all of your customers and each had agreed to receive your company's advertising, either because they want the information or because they've been tempted by an incentive. Author Seth Godin makes this connection real, with the help of technology and he says you can do it, too. Godin argues that individualized \\"permission marketing\\" can break through the increasing clutter of traditional advertising, which he dubs \\"interruption marketing.\\" The Internet is ideally suited to building this one-to-one relationship, he says. His engaging book provides a powerful case for this approach to marketing, which begins with getting the customer's consent to receive frequent messages. Godin combines a historical overview and a discussion of advertising's principles with a description of hands-on methods. We at getAbstract.com recommend his highly accessible book to marketing executives in any industry and especially to managers of Internet-dependent businesses.	2001-02-16

Robert W. Bly's helpful, amusing and slim volume is jam-packed with wisdom and plenty of tips to help you organize, manage your time better, cure procrastination and increase your productivity. While some of his advice is plain old common-sense information that you've probably already heard, it may well bear repeating. Just one look around your office may show you how many people have heard some of this counsel before but are still hopelessly disorganized time wasters. Bly includes pertinent data from surveys of leaders and working stiffs who feel overwhelmed by information, too many demands on their time and the constant struggle to fit 25 hours of work and real life into a 24-hour day. He also sprinkles witty and instructive quotes throughout the book, which we at getAbstract.com recommend to anyone who'd like to have a little extra time left over (and that's everyone).	2001-02-16

Discerning right from wrong can present difficult choices, but author David A. Shapiro tries to cut through the ethical fog to clarify your moral decisions. His thought-provoking, conversational guide to moral choices offers multiple insights. While he acknowledges how difficult ethical decisions can be, he also clearly sets down many ways to understand them and make them, whether they involve personal or professional considerations. The book is readable, not self-righteous or preachy. It simply shines a light on the processes involved in selecting your actions from across a broad right-to-wrong spectrum, and gives a number of real-life examples.

This book is exactly what it says it is: A list of questions designed to make your interviews with prospective job candidates more effective in weeding out the pretenders and uncovering that dream hire. There's not a lot of strategic content here, but this book is rich in tactical detail. For example, most of author Ron Fry's theoretical advice amounts to two points: probe for specifics and keep the applicant talking. The repetition of this self-evident advice is the book's biggest flaw. But in the end, such shortcomings are irrelevant, because the book's real value is in its list of interview questions, with accompanying comments on what answers you should be looking for. It seems impossible that you could read this book and not stumble over one question that makes you smile and tuck it away to spring later on some unsuspecting interviewee.

Roger von Oech uses a combination of explanation, puzzles, and irreverent artwork in his treatise on creative thinking. People who consider themselves creative will instantly take to this book. People who don't feel they are creative may be a little intimidated by the format of the book, but if they can buckle down and force themselves to give it a chance, they stand to gain the most from the book.

Dee Hock interweaves his experiences growing up and founding VISA with his thoughts about how to address the decline of community and of modern institutions. He perceives a general breakdown in the social order, fueled by an overemphasis on monetary values and greed, and perpetuated by institutions committed to old methods derived from ideas about machines and structure rooted in the Industrial Revolution. Now, businesses need a more dynamic, flexible organizational structure based on a clear sense of &quot;purpose&quot;. This purpose should be rooted in contributing to the community. It must be based on ethical principles and values. This process involves developing &quot;chaordic organizations,&quot; those which balance chaos and order. Hock uses examples from his life and from the development of VISA to show how this process works.<br />This is an excellent, thoughtful book. Hock's fascinating story about founding VISA provides a good context for his meditations about the modern need to develop more chaordic, flexible organizations. At times though, his writing can become somewhat ponderous and wordy, particularly when he tries to express fairly complex or abstract ideas.	2001-02-16

Despite the breathless headlines about the latest billion-dollar merger, most mergers don't work. In fact, more than half of all mergers fail, derailed by a common set of pitfalls. Companies merge without considering how they'll integrate after the deal; they don't communicate properly with their employees, and executives don't make decisions quickly enough to placate frightened workers. The executives who navigate mergers effectively are those who communicate well, deal with ambiguity and make decisions in times of instability. Author Price Pritchett offers an easily digested primer on the hazards of mergers, and lists hints for avoiding common problems. The authors provide plenty of concrete examples showing how such companies as Sony, Wells Fargo and the Chicago Sun-Times suffered from the dilemmas that accompany mergers.

This book describes the application and growth, in U.S. corporations, of multi-source employee assessment. This is a review of the strengths and weaknesses of the &iexcl;°360¢ª Feedback&iexcl;± program created by the authors, Mark R. Edwards and Ann J. Ewen. Their book gives you enough information to evaluate multi-source employee assessments. However, if you are reading it because you expect to be able to implement a 360¢ª feedback process without hiring the authors, you will be disappointed. It seems to be written from the consultant's perspective, which is selling consulting services. This limitation should not discourage you from reading this book, if you have a genuine interest in implementing multi-source employee assessment or if it is something your company may need. While the book is not for the causal reader, it is important for anyone in a Fortune 1000 company who functions as a change agent. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book to any manager who might be interested in implementing such an employee review process.	2001-02-16

Author Rupert Eales-White emphasizes the importance of using active listening, focusing on a particular subject, and asking good open-ended questions to get productive results from interviews and conversations. He mixes a few examples with specific how-to principles outlining ways to structure effective conversations. This generally solid book has the feel of a textbook. Some readers may find it too structured or basic, since the author breaks down conversations into sentences with some detail. The book's approach may be more appropriate in organizational cultures where people prefer a focused style of questioning. Those who prefer a more informal, casual conversational style may find his approach less suitable. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book to human resource professionals, to those facing critical interviews, and to those who wish to think strategically about their conversational, information-gathering, or persuasive skills.	2001-02-16

Create a product. Find someone to buy it. That's a pattern that's been pretty consistent since the beginning of civilization. But popular technology guru Jesse Berst says that the Internet has reversed this eternal sequence of commerce. The new logic: Build an audience and then find something to sell to it. That concept is at the core of The Magnet Effect, a brief, hands-on guide to Internet business and marketing. The book illuminates the strategies and tools that have come to define the Internet play, intelligently making a case as to why companies like Amazon.com are worth their multi-billion-dollar valuations even as they are hemorrhaging cash. Berst combines a broad, strategic overview and direct how-to advice in an effective manner that allows us at getAbstract.com to recommend this book to both e-commerce veterans and Internet neophytes.	2001-02-16

When happiness is a function of Nasdaq direction, the concepts of peace and serenity don't get much play. But Paula Peisner Coxe offers a quickie guidebook to inner tranquility. You won't learn anything new here; Coxe's wisdom is the off-the-shelf variety. Each of the book's brief chapters focuses on one way to achieve peace, like forgiving, accepting and loving. These notions don't seem very original, but perhaps Coxe deserves the benefit of the doubt: Millions of Buddhists achieve a sense of well being from writings that are centuries old, and you don't hear them complaining about too many clich&eacute;s. In fact, Coxe does present her advice in a manner that is both soothing and compelling, and suggests several interesting stress-relieving exercises. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book to readers who welcome a dose of spirituality, faith and God, particularly those who come to the book with a pre-existing New Age bent. But if you last felt a sense of overwhelming contentment while watching CNBC, this book may not be quite down-to-earth enough for you.	2001-02-15

The book, which is framed as a manifesto for change in the world of corporate reporting, is written in un-accountant-like language bordering on the subversive. It's main message: Traditional corporate reporting practices are inadequate and downright dangerous in the New Economy. They are inadequate because they don't capture the non-financial measures and intangible assets that now drive value. They are dangerous because they force investors to rely too heavily on short-term financial results, thereby contributing to unprecedented volatility in global equity markets. The authors' remedy? Disclosure of more and better information. This new model is presented in such detail that executives could use it as a blueprint in building new corporate reporting regimens. But you needn't be a corporate leader to appreciate the far-reaching implications of this book, which we at getAbstract.com recommend to all professionals as a - yes - compelling analysis of the current practice and evolving future of corporate reporting and its standards, pivotal benchmarks in the global economy.	2001-02-15

The universal goal is to combine career and financial success with personal happiness, but if that were easy, everyone would be prosperous and blissful. Well, maybe not everyone, but certainly you, says author Marian Thomas, who maintains that you can achieve all this and more by changing your attitude. In this concise book, the author discusses attitude as it relates to personal and business success. In her spin on the Norman Vincent Peal classic, The Power of Positive Thinking, Thomas offers workplace examples and tips. The book is an excellent primer for readers who want a quick introduction to positive thinking and attitude. Readers who want more depth may need to consult secondary sources, but they will still find value here. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book to employees, students and managers, as well as to anyone who'd like a most positive outlook (and maybe some of that money and bliss).	2001-02-15

Bellman provides strategies that support personnel can use to bring about positive change in their organizations. A comprehensive table of contents allows you to go directly to the area of the book that most interests you. In fact, the author designed the book to be read in pieces and many topics stand on their own in manageable chunks. This alone makes the book a useful tool for people who are interested in \\"leading from the middle.\\" The informal writing style and the many useful lists make these ideas accessible to readers who lack formal business training, and thus are likelier to work in support roles. Bellman believes that instead of complaining about your lack of power, you should build your power and get things done. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book to anyone who isn't CEO (yet).	2001-02-12
