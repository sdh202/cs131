731986:US	50720905	R2I9BZ6MMN3ORN	0553493396	568701756	Falling Apart (Sweet Valley High Senior Year No. 23)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Book 23 in the SVH: Senior Year Series	Although Conner McDermott now has total freedom and a father who buys him alcohol, he still isn't happy. It's not until he ends up in the hospital due to alcohol poisoning that he \\"see the light\\" and returns home, agreeing to enter rehab. But first he breaks up with Elizabeth Wakefield, which allows the inevitable to happen: Liz and Evan Plummer hook up.<br />Meanwhile, Melissa Fox and Will Simmons are back in the plot loop again, though there's not much to tell. Will's still at home moping after his big football injury that lost him everything-his football position, scholarship, and girlfriend, who is now falling for Will's replacement and Maria Slater's ex: Ken Matthews.<br />Overall, I thought \\"Falling Apart\\" was a lukewarm book. There were some interesting moments, as I've mentioned above, but nothing earth-shattering. Even Conner and Liz's break up wasn't that big of a deal; it was long overdue, in my opinion. Worth mentioning, though, is Andy Marsden's humorous list on page 165 in regard to the homecoming dance that even he attends.	2004-03-25

Their paths later cross when John attempts to communicate with them by putting a hit out on his wife's lover, a known pedophile.<br />I really got into \\"Talking to Strange Men\\" at the beginning, but my interest petered out about a third of the way through when nothing really explosive had happened so far--it's just John pining for his wife and Mungo going about his everyday life at school and home. My interest was piqued again, though, by the end when one of the \\"mini-Mafia\\" agents is assigned to tail the above-mentioned pedophile. Despite the book being slow-paced and burdened with too many underage spies and their seemingly meaningless assignments, I'd still recommend \\"Talking to Strange Men\\" to mystery readers who're into British psychological suspense, mainly existing Ruth Rendell fans.	2004-03-24

It picks up right where the previous book, \\"The It Guy,\\" left off: with Conner McDermott's intervention. His reaction (summed up perfectly in his beginning journal entry: \\"What. The. Hell.\\") is to run away, hightailing it up the California coast to Red Bluff to find his estranged father, who is a compatible match with him: he's lazy, brooding, and an alcoholic. I feared it'd take another couple books for Conner to find his dad, confront him, etc., but thankfully this subplot wasn't as long-drawn-out as some others in this series.<br />Romance-wise, the following happens: Elizabeth Wakefield does a little \\"unintentional\\" flirting with Conner's best friend, Evan Plummer, while he's away. And Jade Wu has done the unthinkable: she's fallen for Jeremy Aames, despite priding herself on being a player. Jeremy, on the other hand, is treading a little more carefully, especially after she cheated on him.<br />\\"So Not Me\\" really shows how self-absorbed a lot of these characters are, especially in regard to Andy Marsden's sexuality crisis. After an indifferent response to his coming out, he finally gets some decent support from--of all people--his ex-girlfriend, Six Hanson. By the end, things are looking better for him for a change.	2004-03-18

The ending to &quot;Asylum&quot;--or, rather, Rebecca's lamebrained excuses for her abductor--was aggravating. But still, compared to Stephen King's prior six-part serial series, I prefer The Blackstone Chronicles much more, mainly because this series is more suspenseful and horror-filled than &quot;The Green Mile.&quot;<br />Though all six installments are sold separately--&quot;An Eye for an Eye: The Doll&quot; (#1), &quot;Twist of Fate: The Locket&quot; (#2), &quot;Ashes to Ashes: The Dragon's Flame&quot; (#3), &quot;In the Shadow of Evil: The Handkerchief&quot; (#4), &quot;Day of Reckoning: The Stereoscope&quot; (#5), and this one: &quot;Asylum&quot; (#6)--I'd recommend just buying the all-in-one novel; it's easier to read and less expensive that way.	2004-03-17

In \\"The Boyfriend,\\" Joanna Collier wants to break up with her current boyfriend, Dex, in order to date someone new: Shep Forrest. But she doesn't get the chance to do so before Dex accidentally falls off a cliff to his death. Then six weeks later, she starts receiving phone calls and visits from her \\"dead\\" boyfriend. Was his death just a misunderstanding--or is he really back from the grave as a zombie?<br />Like most of Stine's books, \\"The Boyfriend\\" is a quick read and can be finished off in only a few hours; but, unfortunately, it's also formulaic and episodic. There aren't too many surprises, either, that Stine fans can't figure out for themselves one step ahead, leaving a rather disappointing mess at the end. Nevertheless, his books do have an appeal like junk food: there's no real nutritional value to them and they probably rot young readers' brains, but they're quickly-gratifying and addictive. Worth reading if you're looking for some semi-scary mind candy.	2004-03-12

But if you're a FR fantasy fan--or just a fantasy fan, in general--then you'll probably enjoy these 14 stories:<br />1) &quot;Speaking with the Dead&quot; by Elaine Cunningham -- When a gnome is murdered, a young bard and his elven servant try to prove their caravan leader's innocence. A little slow at the beginning, and confusing, but it has its moments.<BR>2) &quot;A Walk in the Snow&quot; by Dave Gross -- Another (somewhat better) murder mystery, this one of a wizard being murdered and an innkeeper in charge of solving it.<BR>3) &quot;The Rose Window&quot; by Monte Cook -- Upon bringing a rose window into his church, a loremaster notices unearthly shadows in its panes. A captivating story, though the ending does leave you hanging a bit.<BR>4) &quot;The Club Rules&quot; by James Lowder -- A butler is accused of murder and a young explorer is assigned to prove his innocence.<BR>5) &quot;Thieves' Justice&quot; by Mary H. Herbert -- While stealing a horse, a horse thief and her friend stumble across a dead man, resulting in the friend being accused of murder. One of the best stories here.<BR>6) &quot;Ekhar Lorrent: Gnome Detective&quot; by Steven &quot;Stan!&quot; Brown -- A rhyming gnome detective with &quot;a sixth sense about murder&quot; investigates the death of a cyclops. An interesting murder plot with an unforgettable, if not slightly annoying, character.<BR>7) &quot;The Devil and Tertius Wands&quot; by Jeff Grubb -- An adventurer and his genie set out to recover a stolen family heirloom for a beautiful stranger. Another good story.<BR>8) &quot;H&quot; by Richard Lee Byers -- One by one, a band of adventurers are killed in their sleep, leaving only a blood-written letter &quot;H&quot; as a clue. Fast paced and well written.<BR>9) &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot; by Keith Francis Strohm -- A dark priest saves a captain's life, and, in return, asks for a powerful dagger.<BR>10) &quot;Whence the Song of Steel&quot; by J. Robert King -- A bodyguard is hired to protect two opera tenors from death threats.<BR>11) &quot;An Unusual Suspect&quot; by Brian M. Thomsen -- An amnesiac sets out to avenge his friend's death.<BR>12) &quot;Darkly, Through a Glass of Ale&quot; by Peter Archer -- A merchant observes the happenings in a warring city. Dull and complicated.<BR>13) &quot;Lynaelle&quot; by Thomas M. Reid -- A young sorceress is accused of killing her teacher. Jumps right into the action on the first page (the first sentence, really), but then drags a bit during the back story.<BR>14) &quot;The Grinning Ghost of Taverton Hall&quot; by Ed Greenwood -- An estate is haunted by a ghost who appears just prior to someone dying.	2004-03-11

That is, until almost a year later when a handful of actresses are murdered one by one, similar to how Erik and Tony had written. Now the two writers are called in to create a screenplay based on the Video Killer's movie-remaking murders, a la Alfred Hitchcock style (eg, \\"Frenzy,\\" \\"Rear Window,\\" etc.).<br />Despite the \\"Psycho\\"-like front cover of a naked dead girl in a bathtub, the murder scenes aren't very graphic or sexualized, which non-horror readers might appreciate. It was a fast read, though (I finished it in a couple days), but it wasn't as suspenseful as I'd hoped. The red herrings weren't very believable for one, and I guessed the killer partway through, mainly due to his/her work history and aversion to blood. The suspense near the end was kind of ruined for me, too, when his/her identity was revealed a little too soon. Still, this being my first Joanne Fluke book, I look forward to reading more by her. Along with several other horror novels published by Pocket Books in the '80s, this one was pretty enjoyable.	2004-03-04

The narrator is Chelsea Jenning, an 18-year-old Tennessean chosen for a summer intern job in New York City at Trash, one of the nation's sleaziest, hip new talk shows. Chelsea and two other female interns--Karma Kushner and Alyssa \\"Lisha\\" Bishop (an old best friend of Chelsea's from grade school)--are put in a great loft, just across the hall from three other great-looking guy interns: Nick Shaw (the guy Chelsea falls for, even though Jazz Stewart, the hostess of Trash, deems him her boy toy), Alan Van Kleef, and Sky Addison. (Note: Everybody in this book looks/sounds like some celebrity: Chelsea looks like Alicia Silverstone; Karma sounds like Fran Drescher; Lisha looks like Demi Moore; Sky looks like Keanu Reeves, etc.--hence nobody is ugly, which gives this book/series a rather superficial feel.)<br />Once on the job, Chelsea barely uses her brain or talent and has serious doubts about staying, especially when her past is threatened to be revealed on national TV: of her father going mental one day and shooting a restaurant full of people, then trying to kill her and her mother.<br />The title of this book/series does give a hint of what to expect, e.g., a hostess that almost bares it all on live TV, talk show topics like \\"Transvestite Teen Girls versus Real Teen Girls--who's sexier?\\" So, it's basically a tamer version of the Jerry Springer show for teens. The writing will appeal to young teens; it's humorous, light, and fluffy with some romance and drama thrown in for good measure. Certainly recommended to Cherie Bennett fans.	2004-02-15

Her lyrics are quite moving, in particular \\"The Girl Inside the Girl,\\" which was inspired by her older brother, Jeffrey, who killed himself three years ago after coining the expression \\"...the band only plays. It never dances,\\" hence the title of this book and her band's debut CD and single.<br />Judy spends the duration of the story struggling over her brother's untimely death and trying to find some catharsis through her music and up-and-coming fame in her rock band Wedding Night. At the same time, a love triangle develops between her and one of her band mates (Mark the Music) and Nick Praetorious, the quintessential \\"bad boy\\" rock singer they tour with. How this hot-and-cold relationship draws out and concludes is quite satisfying for any romantic. Judy, especially, is a remarkable character--she's extremely bright and independent, and like in the book, other young women will want to be her.<br />This is one of the best contemporary young adult novels I've read in awhile. It's fast paced, touching and deep, and suitable for the slightly older teen crowd due to some mature themes. In fact, the book seemed to be written from a much older character's point of view than from a 16-year-old's. At times, I couldn't connect her age and actions together, but I loved this book regardless. Recommended.	2004-02-06

When Oliver Metcalf, a newspaper editor who has feelings for Rebecca, gives her a present--an 'R'-initialed handkerchief--something horrible begins to happen in the Wagner home. The climax, not to sound morbid, is one of my favorite death endings among the six parts; and the story itself ends on quite a cliffhanger for Rebecca. It'll certainly have readers eager to read the next part: &quot;Day of Reckoning: The Stereoscope&quot; (#5).	2004-02-01

(SVH #54)	While Jessica Wakefield's steady boyfriend, A. J. Morgan, is out of state for the weekend, she falls for Christopher, a surfer she meets at the beach (she doesn't even know his last name), hence the title of this book: \\"Two-Boy Weekend.\\" Part of Jessica wants to be faithful to A. J. (uh-huh, riiight); but another part of Jess wants to revert to her old self, the one who likes to date a new guy every week. But then Christopher starts stalking her, and Jess is afraid A. J. will find out. Ah, typical Jess: never thinking about the consequences. I was never a big Jessica fan (I preferred Liz instead, who, at the end of this book, is in danger of being kidnapped--deja vu from book #13, \\"Kidnapped!\\"--because of her sister), but fans of this wayward twin should love her two-boy weekend fiasco. As for any subplots--which is typical in a SVH book that can't stretch its main plot to 150 pages or so--there aren't any; it's all about Jess and her boy-juggling drama.	2004-01-19

Then there's Lacey Dupree who blames herself for her boyfriend's (Rick Stratton) rock-climbing accident which has him in the hospital unconscious (Brittany's fault, though, from the previous book, \\"Cheating Hearts\\"). And more insecurity and jealousy emerges between Karen Jacobs--who fears her boyfriend (Ben Newhouse) still has feelings for his ex (Emily Van Patten) in NYC--and Samantha Daley--whose makeover of Kyle Kirkwood, a \\"brainy social zero,\\" might have made him a little too appealing to other girls. And these were just the major storylines.<br />Needless to say by my 3-star rating, \\"The Trouble With Love\\" wasn't one of the best RH books I've read. It was rather confusing with so many characters, and I actually had to make a list to keep all the couples straight. It's only told from the girls' p.o.v., which was a good and bad thing. Good being there were fewer characters to get involved with; but bad in that all the girls began to act and sound the same. And after finishing the book, I pretty much forgot what it was about. This certainly isn't one I'd recommend unless you're really into this series, a series that strongly mimics Francine Pascal's Sweet Valley High books more than Keene's own Nancy Drew series.	2004-01-05

The middle part of the story is bloodless, as it closely follows Jules Hartwick, president of the First National Bank of Blackstone, as he stresses over an audit, then becomes severely paranoid after finding the above-mentioned heart-shaped locket that he believes is a sign of his wife's infidelity. This is a good serial addition to the six-part Blackstone Chronicles, preceded by &quot;An Eye for an Eye: The Doll&quot; (#1) and succeeded by &quot;Ashes to Ashes: The Dragon's Flame&quot; (#3), &quot;In the Shadow of Evil: The Handkerchief&quot; (#4), &quot;Day of Reckoning: The Stereoscope&quot; (#5), and &quot;Asylum&quot; (#6). As a whole, &quot;The Blackstone Chronicles&quot; is one of my favorite John Saul books.	2004-01-01

It's told in the first person by Grace Rossi, a single mother working in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as a newly-appointed assistant to the hot chief judge, Armen Gregorian. Just hours after their one-night stand, Armen allegedly commits suicide, but Grace is reluctant to accept this, despite their relationship being just a superficial roll in the hay--or office, in this case. Instead, she spends the duration of the book tracking down his killer, with some help from Shake and Bake (one of my favorite characters), an FBI agent leading a double life as an eccentric raincoat/bonnet-wearing derelict (thus his nickname). As a mystery, &quot;Final Appeal&quot; wasn't very suspenseful (no major life-and-death scares until around the climax), but it was a fast, easy read, which reminded me of some of James Patterson's work. The dialogue was realistic, though the profanity made the characters sound like they were in a high school locker room rather than a courtroom. Still, this was a nice, fluffy legal thriller full of dry wit and humor. I look forward to reading more by Scottoline.	2003-12-30

The idea behind this story came from a Nancy Drew book Ann M. Martin read as a kid: \\"The Hidden Staircase\\" by Carolyn Keene, which is also worth reading if you're a Nancy Drew fan. In this book, Dawn believes her house is haunted by a previous owner's ghost due to the strange noises she hears at night. Plus she discovers a secret passage between the barn and her bedroom, where she finds very old objects (like a coin, button, buckle, and key) that she believes belong to the ghost. As in all the BSC books, this isn't the only storyline going on in the book. A few chapters involve various baby-sitting jobs, like at the Pike household, which holds some clues to Dawn's ghost theory. \\"The Ghost at Dawn's House\\" isn't the only ghost book of Dawn's. If you like the same material and character, then you'll probably enjoy BSC Mystery #12: \\"Dawn and the Surfer Ghost.\\"	2003-12-20

This is an uplifting anthology of 17 short-short stories (each averaging about 5 pages, which should appeal to more reluctant young readers) about various friendships developing in everyday neighborhoods, starting off with the title story:<br />1) \\"Snow Trouble\\" by H. M. Myer, about a boy who must decide between making money shoveling snow for others or cleaning his poor neighbor's sidewalk for free. There's a good lesson learned in this one (of helping those in need), with the added bonus of actually getting something in return, even though it isn't cash.<br />The other 16 stories are as follows:<br />2) \\"The Flower Garden That Grew\\" by Myrtis Bucy -- A girl's flower garden has a catching effect in her rundown neighborhood.<BR>3) \\"You'll See\\" by Rosalyn Hart Finch -- A boy creates a housewarming basket for his new neighbors. This one keeps you guessing till the very end.<BR>4) \\"Darcie Dines Out\\" by Angela B. Haight -- A girl learns to try new food when she and her father \\"dine out\\" at her neighbors'.<BR>5) \\"Basket of Friendship\\" by Pamela Schmidt Hodge -- This one is somewhat similar to \\"You'll See,\\" in that a girl makes a housewarming basket for her new neighbors.<BR>6) \\"A Thief in the Neighborhood\\" by Kathleen West -- A new boy is blamed for stealing a camera, which he didn't do. I wouldn't say what he did to prove his innocence was worth it, but at least the outcome was fair.<BR>7) \\"Peter, Peaches, and the Porch Swing\\" by Linda Schultz -- A boy writes \\"secret\\" letters to his elderly neighbor.<BR>8) \\"Blackout Banquet\\" by Beth Thompson -- A neighborhood has a blackout on Thanksgiving Day.<BR>9) \\"The Grouch of Greentree Street\\" by Mary Jane Hopkins -- An elderly grouch learns to smile when he meets a young girl.<BR>10) \\"The Gift Garden\\"by Nelda Johnson Liebig -- An anniversary gift turns into a gift for the whole neighborhood.<BR>11) \\"Underground River\\" by Jean Waldschmidt -- When his family's cattle suffer from a drought, a young boy goes in search of a solution.<BR>12) \\"Wendy's Tree\\" by Karen Cummins Pida -- A small girl sets out to climb a large tree.<BR>13) \\"Sarah's Mistake\\" by Sister Mary Murray, H. M. -- A new girl makes assumptions about her stuck-up neighbor.<BR>14) \\"The Blue Box for Sabbath\\" by Marilyn Leitner Reiss -- A Jewish boy tries to find a way of donating money to the poor, despite his family's own financial troubles.<BR>15) \\"The Soup That Made Itself\\" by Rose-Marie Provencher -- Several nosy neighbors separately help make dinner for a woman while she's away for the moment. While the story was well intentioned, it may remind readers to lock their doors while they're away.<BR>16) \\"Neighborhood Day\\" by Paul Tulien -- A holiday is created after two siblings misinterpret what their neighbor tells them.<BR>17) \\"Bobby Sniffs Around the Block\\" by Lucy Fuchs -- A boy learns about his environment by imitating his dog's habit of sniffing things.	2003-12-16

Then it goes into the techniques and three methods of soapmaking: cold-process, hand-milling, and melting (aka Jell-O method; the easiest of the three). There are even recipes for you to try, like Cinnamon Ginger, Honey Vanilla, Coconut Rosewood, etc, which just made me hungry after reading them. I guess the nice thing about soapmaking is that if you mess up, you can always eat your mistake (j/k). I haven't tried any of the recipes myself, so I can't say they'll work, especially after reading a few other reviews below. As for the shampoo section (which is also lumped here), that's reduced to just 8 pages--half of which are just photos--and doesn't go into great detail.<br />2) 'Making Scents,' which also begins with a history on fragrances, this time starting around 3500 BC. I wasn't too interested in this portion of the book, but it is a great place for beginners to start since organic perfumes are relatively easy to make, and the tools required are a lot fewer and less dangerous than for soapmaking. However, as the author mentions, don't expect to make a reproduction of Chanel No 5 or the like. There are some good perfume recipes, though, like Rose Water, Vanilla Bean Water, and Pear Nectar Perfume (none of which I've tried, but would try if I ever got around to it).<br />I received &quot;Making Soaps and Scents&quot; awhile back as a gift. What I liked most about it was the vegetable-based soapmaking recipes since I'm a vegan and didn't want to get involved with any animal products. However, I'm not very good at arts and crafts at all, and forget about getting me in the kitchen: I usually end up burning something when I do. For that reason, I've been a little wary of attempting any of these soapmaking ideas. For now, I'm happy just buying vegan soap/shampoos at the store, like Crystal (a soap), which doesn't include or experiment on animals. But for those who are into arts and crafts, then &quot;Making Soaps and Scents&quot; is certainly worth checking out. It's quite informative, with several tips and troubleshooting pages throughout the book; not to mention it's very colorful and beautifully photographed, even if the photos are mainly just of soap.	2003-12-07

If you've read and liked the Silent Night trilogy, then this collector's edition is certainly worth buying since it contains all three books (and is less expensive than buying all of them separately):<br />· \\"Silent Night\\" -- Reva Dalby, the redheaded baddie readers will love to hate, is targeted by someone who wants to seriously hurt her, while her poor cousin Pam is planning on robbing Dalby Department Store with two of her friends.<br />· \\"Silent Night 2\\" -- Reva is targeted yet again, this time by three kidnappers who want to hold her and her cousin Pam for ransom.<br />· \\"Silent Night 3\\" -- Reva takes credit for designing scarves her cousin Pam did and heads a fashion show at Dalby Department Store--only to have the models get killed one after the other.<br />Most Fear Street fans will probably enjoy this holiday Super Chiller trilogy, since it has everything that's typical with a Stine book: blood (and plenty of it), page-turning cliffhangers, plot twists, simple writing style, and short paragraphs. However, these things can also be tiresome and predictable at times. But Stine fans who are accustomed to and prefer it will enjoy this trilogy anyway.	2003-12-01

Coming home from college for the holidays with her roommate (Grace Morton), Reva Dalby is unaware of the danger that lays ahead for her yet again in this third and final book in the Silent Night trilogy. In this book, she heads a fashion show at her family's department store, after taking credit for designing some scarves her cousin Pam and Pam's friend (Willow) did themselves. But before the show can get under way, one of the models is murdered, followed by yet another (it just sucks being a model in this book), making a murderous trail straight for Reva.<br />While the previous two Silent Night books switched point of views between Reva and other characters, \\"Silent Night 3\\" zeroes in on Reva a little more, of her acting like her usual snobby self--stealing boyfriends and stabbing people in the back, so to speak. Out of the three books, this is my least favorite. It's not as suspenseful as the others until around the end; and even then, there are too many unbelievable plot twists to make \\"Silent Night 3\\" very enjoyable. You can probably skip this one and not feel guilty about it.	2003-12-01

As a way to get money and revenge for being fired at Dalby's Department Store, Paul \\"Pres\\" Nichols, his girlfriend (Diane Morris), and older brother (Danny) plan on holding the owner's daughter (Reva Dalby) for ransom--except everything that could go wrong does, like kidnapping the wrong girl: Reva's poor cousin, Pam Dalby, one of the few characters who makes a reappearance from the previous book. Almost all the other characters in here are new. Like in the first \\"Silent Night,\\" Reva isn't in the forefront of this sequel very much (a lot of time is spent on the kidnappers), though she is still as cruel as ever, apparently not learning her lesson from a year ago.<br />If you liked this book, then you'll probably enjoy the other two: \\"Silent Night\\" and \\"Silent Night 3.\\"	2003-11-30

Reva Dalby is a mean-spirited high school senior who has more enemies than friends--1) an ex-boyfriend who can't take a hint, 2) a resentful poor cousin who plans on robbing Reva's family's department store with two other friends, and 3) the son of a man Reva's father just fired (just to name a few)--and any number of them could be responsible for the cruel pranks that have befallen her lately, like receiving a bottle of blood as a gift and finding a pin in her lipstick the hard way. But which one of her enemies wants to harm her the most?<br />\\"Silent Night\\" is a fun holiday scare for Fear Street fans. Being the first Super Chiller in this trilogy, it introduces Reva, the redheaded baddie most readers will love to hate, though the second storyline involving Reva's poor cousin (Pam Dalby) is a lot more interesting and dangerous, filled with blackmail, robbery, a police car chase, and murder. The following two books (\\"Silent Night 2\\" and \\"Silent Night 3\\") are also worth reading if you liked this one. And if you plan on purchasing this trilogy, then I'd recommend buying the collector's edition of \\"Silent Night,\\" which contains all three books; it's a better deal than buying them separately.	2003-11-29

While &quot;A Place Apart&quot; does touch on the loss of Victoria's father--as well as the idea of her mother marrying again (which she isn't too thrilled about)--it's Victoria's friendship with Hugh that has the greater impact on her. She realizes he's not the person she thought he was, though most readers can guess this beforehand.<br />At first, the small print and long chapters in &quot;A Place Apart&quot; gave me the false impression this was going to be a slow and tedious story, but I was thankfully proven wrong. This is a wonderful, charming book and worth reading if you like well written coming-of-age stories.	2003-11-26

However, when Erin answers an ad reading &quot;Loves Music, Loves to Dance,&quot; she is later killed by the man who wrote it, a man who turns out to be a personal-ad serial killer. Darcy sets out to discover who he is by going on the same dates Erin did, but she may not live to find out when he targets her as his next victim.<br />&quot;Loves Music, Loves to Dance&quot; is a fast-paced mystery, due in part to the brief chapters. Each scene is perhaps 1-2 pages long, which I liked, but, at times, the short passages didn't flow very well together. Plus there were too many characters to keep track of--suspects and investigators--which was basically to keep the reader guessing the identity of the killer. It's not too hard to guess him, though, if you keep a sharp eye on one of the men at the beginning, but even I had my doubts halfway through. Overall, this was a good mystery. Clark fans should like this one.	2003-11-24

Another good first-time S&amp;S story/author.<BR>2) Inspired by Hercules and the Amazons, a princess petitions the Amazons for &quot;Free Passage&quot; (by Mary Catelli) to an island with a curse-breaking herb.<BR>3) &quot;The Conjuror's Light&quot; by Lisa Campos -- A conjuror is commanded by her king to find the mythical Warblade. One of the longest stories here, but a very good S&amp;S debut by Campos.<BR>4) Based on an article T. Borregaard read on historical warfare, &quot;My Sister's Song&quot; tells of a warrior's plan to stop an invading Roman squadron, without using weapons. An interesting story, but not very surprising, since their method is revealed within the first couple pages.<BR>5) &quot;The Summons&quot; by Bunnie Bessell -- A bodyguard is summoned to the Temple for another task: to kill the prince she's been protecting. One of my favorites.<BR>6) &quot;Luz&quot; by Patricia Duffy Novak -- An outcast tries to intercept a child slavery ring, and in doing so, redeems herself in the eyes of the Goddess. It's hard to understand Luz's devotion to a community that treats her so poorly, yet everything is explained by the end.<BR>7) &quot;Caelqua's Spring&quot; by Vera Nazarian -- A ghostlike water entity returns to find her brother. I'm not sure I understood this one at all.<BR>8) &quot;Deep As Rivers&quot; by Cynthia McQuillin -- A female troll stumbles upon a dying elf and seeks the help of a witch, only to suffer from what the elf suffers (a broken heart) when she falls for him.<BR>9) &quot;Weapons at War&quot; by Charles Laing -- A warrior is assisted (though reluctantly) in battle by her temperamental enchanted sword, as well as by her other talking weapons. Brief story, with a good moral.<BR>10) &quot;Hell Hath No Fury....&quot; by Lee Martindale -- A bard is summoned to perform for the demonbred baroness and learns of her parentage.<BR>11) &quot;An Exchange of Favors&quot; by Dorothy Heydt -- A young woman is asked for a favor by a god (Mercury).<BR>12) &quot;Price of the Sword&quot; by Kim Fryer -- A witch is approached by a soldier to remove a curse from her bloodthirsty sword.<BR>13) &quot;Demon Calling&quot; by ElizaBeth Gilligan -- After her mistress abandons her, a young woman seeks shelter from a dangerous stranger and finds the answer to her mistresses question: What are you?<BR>14) &quot;Nor Iron Bars a Cage&quot; by Deborah Wheeler -- A witch is imprisoned for her ability to manipulate metals.<BR>15) &quot;The Haunting of Princess Elizabeth&quot; by Carrie Vaughn -- Three ghosts protect Elizabeth I on her way to the throne as Queen of England. Enjoyable.<BR>16) &quot;Shadow Soul&quot; by Laura J. Underwood -- A mage tracks down a shadow demon in order to save the soul of a bride.<BR>17) &quot;Memories Traced in Snow&quot; by Dave Smeds -- A scholar helps her cousin find the cause of his mysteriously stolen memories.<BR>18) &quot;Valkyrie&quot; by Jenn Reese -- A Norse woman mourns the sudden loss of her son. Good twist at the end.<BR>19) A warrior-turn-slave offers to engage in a &quot;Soul Dance&quot; (by Lisa Silverthorne) to make peace between two warring tribes.<BR>20) &quot;Lady of Flame&quot; by Diana L. Paxson -- During warring times, a Norse wisewoman has visions of a burning goddess in connection with an Irish slavewoman.<BR>21) &quot;The Tears of the Moon&quot; by Cynthia Ward -- A young woman has visions of barbarians invading her village, which turn out to be true. With a bit of unrequited love thrown in, this is a great ending to this anthology.<br />Sadly, this was the last S&amp;S anthology Bradley had an active hand in before dying in 1999--though she did help prepare acouple others, with the help of Elisabeth Waters, who stepped in as editor for volumes #18-20 and will be replaced by another S&amp;S contributor (and Bradley's sister-in-law): Diana L. Paxson. If you're a fan of this feminist fantasy series, then getting this book--along with the others--is worth it. There're some really good stories in here.	2003-11-22

She's completely obsessed, and believes he thinks of her as more than his favorite student--but does he?<br />Meanwhile, Jessica Wakefield is stuck with one of her last workshop picks: electronics, which she knows absolutely nothing about. So she gets some help from her nerdy lab partner, in order to catch her friend, Lila Fowler, in a possible lie.<br />\\"Teacher Crush\\" was a pretty good SVH addition, though Olivia's desperation to find a boyfriend was kind of out of character, since she's relatively independent. But, overall, this one's worth reading if you're a SVH fan, and especially if you like Olivia.	2003-11-18

In fact, I have yet to come across a book by her (either for adults or children) that I don't like. This one is more for preteen boys (age 10 - 14), but I'd still recommend it to Blume fans, regardless of age/gender.	2003-11-16

Everyone's close-lipped when she confronts her family and friends about it, but Macey's determined to find out what happened, especially after a black acquaintance from the city is suddenly shot dead.<br />\\"Burning Up\\" is a great contemporary novel for young adults, touching on a rather sore subject for some people: racism. The writing is exceptional and interesting, as are the two main characters: Macey and her 16-year-old boyfriend/neighbor, Austin.

With a title like \\"Check It Out--and Die!,\\" young horror fans can't help but be drawn to this book, just like Charlie Stanton and his classmates, who are literally getting sucked into the books they're reading and living out certain situations in them. It all starts when a substitute librarian, Ms. Gunkel, comes to Edison Elementary School and starts a horror reading club. And Charlie and his friends, being the horror fans that they are, are more than eager to join and start reading. However, when the above happens to them, they must try and figure out a way of escaping--as well as rescue the other five missing readers--before they all turn into characters in the books. The ending to \\"Check It Out--and Die!\\" kind of leaves you hanging, but if you like R. L. Stine's Goosebumps series, then you'll probably like this Spinetinglers series as well. And going along with the writer's pseudonym, there are plenty of coffins. Recommended to readers age 8 - 12.	2003-11-12

However, after repeated escapes--and spending much of his time out of the picture in this book--Kinsey Millhone, the 32-year-old no-nonsense private investigator, is hired by his father to investigate Jean's death and hopefully prove Bailey's innocence.<br />&quot;'F' is for Fugitive&quot; is yet another enjoyable Kinsey Millhone mystery with lots of quirky characters, particularly Bailey Fowler's family, who own the motel near where Jean was killed. It's also Kinsey's temporary residence while her apartment is being rebuilt after the happenings in the previous book (&quot;'E' is for Evidence&quot;). &quot;'F' is for Fugitive&quot; is relatively fast paced and has a more rounded ending than in some of Grafton's other books. And, as usual, I enjoyed Kinsey's sarcastic humor and refreshing first person narrative. Worth reading if you're into this alphabet mystery series.	2003-11-11

Can her male friend (Sheck) from NY, who's coming to visit for Thanksgiving, help her make up her mind?<br />Out of the four girls in this series, Randy is my favorite, and I could empathize with her in \\"Rebel, Rebel\\" (though I'm not sure why it was titled that). While reading this book, I kept flashing on another series character: Stacey McGill from The Baby-sitters Club, who shares quite a few similarities with Randy--they're both from NYC (and miss it), they dress a little wild, both of their parents are divorced and they live with their mothers, etc. Young readers who like that series will probably like Girl Talk as well.

It's adorable. There are almost 400 color photos in it, averaging about 1 to 2 cats/kittens (as well as a few pals: ducklings, fish, and rabbits) per daily box. Each month comes with a cat-oriented quote, such as \\"Thousands of years ago, cats were worshipped as gods. Cats have never forgotten this.\\" There's enough room to scribble a little in each box, but it's so cute you may not want to.	2003-11-07

I just couldn't get into it. The writing was simple (which I didn't mind), somewhat educational (a plus for ignoramuses, like myself), but quite repetitive. As one reviewer mentioned before me, the word 'frowned' was constantly used.<br />The attack scenes weren't very graphic, which kind of disappointed me; but for those who are squeamish, this is probably much appreciated. There's more implied carnage (discovered appendages, etc.) rather than any in-depth descriptions of how the victims were eaten, save for a few scenes near the end. However, it was still scary fun to imagine a shark--a megalodon at that--coming inland rather than remaining out in the ocean to hunt for its prey. It reminded me why I never really enjoyed swimming as a kid--even in swimming pools.<br />A TV movie was supposed to be made of this book (to air on NBC), but it looks like that idea's been scratched. By this book alone, though, there wouldn't have been any competition against &quot;Jaws&quot; (the source of my swimming phobia).<br />Overall, this was a relatively tame thriller; and unless you're really into reading books on predatory animals (especially sharks), then I'd just skip this one.	2003-11-05

Instead, it deals with other things, like the unfavorable new junior volunteer (Christie Hale) at Mercy Hospital who keeps relying on the other J.V.s to cover for her--which almost gets Nichole terminated. Then there's Bernie O'Connor's Secret Santa at school who keeps giving her expensive gifts, as well as the Secret Santa drawing for the patients at the hospital.<br />This was a good holiday finale to a short-lived series for preteens.

This whole book felt like Ken had suddenly slipped into Will's shoes--he takes his position, could possibly win his football scholarship, and even sneaks a \\"consoling\\" hug with his girlfriend (Melissa Fox). This latter incident has Maria Slater (Ken's girlfriend) feeling extremely insecure, and why not? The reader can feel something brewing between Ken and Melissa, which might develop into more in the next book: \\"So Not Me\\" (especially after how this book ends)--not that I think they'd work out; I just like the drama, which makes this series so good.<br />Meanwhile, Elizabeth Wakefield, Tia Ramirez, Andy Marsden, Maria, Evan Plummer, Megan, and Mrs. McDermott plan an intervention concerning Conner's drinking problem. (Big cliffhanger there.) And Jessica Wakefield and Jade Wu are still fighting over Jeremy Aames--the score still being in Jade's favor.<br />\\"The It Guy\\" was a good SVHSY book, particularly if you're a Ken fan, since he's more in the spotlight. The two short children's stories by Elizabeth (p 74-8) and Conner (p 140-5) were a nice touch as well, illustrating how each feels their relationship is going, though how they react to their problems is not surprising at all: Liz being the comforter, and Conner being the loner. It'd be nice to see some kind of resolve between these two--good or bad, I don't care; just as long as it's soon.	2003-10-29

I had to flip back through it before I started to remember what it was all about.<br />It starts off in Canaan, New Jersey, where MaryAnne Carpenter lives with her two kids: 13-year-old Alison and 10-year-old Logan--but quickly moves on to Sugarloaf, Idaho, where MaryAnne's 13-year-old godchild (Joey Wilkenson) is suddenly orphaned when his parents die in separate, but suspicious, accidents. Being the godmother, MaryAnne is deemed his guardian, though it's the mysterious man living in the woods with a wolf that the title is referring to, a man Joey unknowingly has a lot in common with.<br />Shortly after MaryAnne and her two kids arrive on the Wilkenson's ranch, several brutal attacks occur which lead everyone to believe a wild animal is loose nearby--though MaryAnne begins to suspect something else from her moody young charge.<br />I'm a sucker for werewolf books, so I enjoyed &quot;Guardian.&quot; The biogenetic twist on the mutations was a refreshing take, but a lot of the other twists weren't too surprising. The ending is left open for a possible sequel; but, so far, one hasn't been put out, though I prefer it just the way it is. If you're a Saul fan, then you'll probably enjoy this one.	2003-10-28

Consequently, she becomes involved in his life when the remaining vampire hunter abducts Kerry's father and 4-year-old brother (Ian) and later kills Ethan's vampire friend (Regina Sloane). Together they spend a great deal of the book driving around in stolen cars, looking for her missing family and a lone vampire hunter whose work isn't finished yet.<br />\\"Companions of the Night\\" is a well-written, exciting book that's hard to put down. There's plenty of action and suspense, with some sparring romance between Kerry and Ethan (though I found Ethan much too manipulative and evasive to be a satisfying heartthrob), which should appeal to vampire fans of all ages.	2003-10-27

It's about a new chicana student named Rosa Jameson (though she goes by Rose to \\"Americanize\\" herself--and she even goes so far as to make up a fake past). She's excited to be invited to pledge Pi Beta Alpha, a popular SVH sorority; but she's also nervous because she fears her new friends will discriminate against her for being Mexican--and some would if they found out (like Lila Fowler, the pledge chairwoman). To further complicate things, Rose's Mexican grandmother comes to Sweet Valley for a two week visit, and Rose is a wreck trying to make sure her friends don't meet her or else they'll realize she's been lying this entire time.<br />Overall, this was a good read if you're a SVH fan. Rose learns to feel comfortable in her own skin, so to speak (though the reader can guess as much by the front cover). Along with the sorority storyline, there's a secondary one involving the fraternity Phi Epsilon, with Todd Wilkins and Bruce Patman fighting over who exactly gets to join their elite group. And then there's Jessica Wakefield, who is failing math and having relationship trouble (yet again) with her steady boyfriend, Sam Woodruff, which should continue in the next book: \\"Kidnapped By the Cult!\\"	2003-10-26

However, this book happens to be where I paused from reading Andrews' following books. Instead I went back to her old series, because I was getting a bit bored with the same plot lines. I had held out this long hoping something would change; it didn't. Stopping in the middle of this series is probably why I didn't particularly like the Landry books--or maybe it's vice versa; I don't know. But I did like the Louisiana setting. That's one thing I like about her books: the setting.<br />In &quot;All That Glitters,&quot; the main relationships between 18-year-old Ruby Dumas (the protagonist), her wealthy halfbrother/childhood sweetheart Paul Tate, her twin sister Gisselle, and her baby's father Beau Andreas come full circle to where they had begun initially in &quot;Ruby.&quot; Ruby returns to the bayou and reluctantly marries Paul in order to provide some stability for her newborn daughter, Pearl. And Gisselle and Beau elope for their own twisted reasons--Gisselle's: to get even with Ruby; Beau's: to pretend he's still with Ruby.<br />But then the men switch places yet again when Gisselle falls into a coma (thus explaining the Sleeping Beauty-like front cover), and Ruby's not-so-well hidden feelings for Beau are allowed to be played out when she pretends to be his wife/her own sister. This whole scheme was quite bizarre (why Paul agreed to this, I can't understand), though it was fun to read. Still, my opinion of Ruby certainly changed afterwards. Paul, like a lot of the lovers/relatives of the heroine, is the typical doting--more or less obsessed--male protagonist, and you almost feel sorry for him. That or you want to smack him in the head to wake some sense up in him. Though that's kind of a moot point by the end.<br />During all this romantic drama, a few more characters die, such as Daphne (no big loss there--she's just the evil stepmother),as well as a few more important characters (their deaths are rather tragic). &quot;All That Glitters&quot; is the last book told from Ruby's point of view. The following book, &quot;Hidden Jewel&quot; (#4), is passed on to her daughter, and the series wraps up with the prequel, &quot;Tarnished Gold&quot; (#5). And if you started in the middle of this series, then don't forget the first two: &quot;Ruby&quot; (#1) and &quot;Pearl in the Mist&quot; (#2).	2003-10-24

It's been more than 10 years since I've read this book, and I was lucky enough to stumble across it at a book sale the other day, seeing as how I had forgotten the author and title, and only remembered it by the front cover--of a skull shape in the blonde girl's hair.<br />The book's about 15-year-old Marjorie Loring who is invited to stay with her beautiful cousin Charlene Kensington and her husband (David) for a few weeks in Larrimore Hills, Indiana. A short time later, Charlene starts receiving anonymous letters referring to an accident involving David, in which his previous wife tragically died--and warns that Charlene will be his next victim.<br />\\"Where Evil Is\\" isn't big on action; nevertheless, it is fast paced, due in part to it only being 117 pages, which should appeal to more reluctant young readers. The ending theory about David's first wife's death is a little far-fetched; but, overall, I liked the story. Worth reading if you're into low-key suspense.	2003-10-20

Montgomery Books)	Books	4	9	9	N	N	'Sequel' to "Chronicles of Avonlea"	\\"Further Chronicles of Avonlea,\\" the 'sequel' to \\"Chronicles of Avonlea,\\" expands upon Avonlea's rich history with 15 additional short stories:<br />\\"Aunt Cynthia's Persian Cat\\" -- Two sisters cat-sit their aunt's treasured white Persian while she's away for two months--until the cat disappears and one of the girls' annoying beaus comes to the rescue. A lighthearted tale for cat lovers. >> \\"The Materializing of Cecil\\" -- An old maid tries to impress the women in her sewing circle by concocting a tale of her imaginary past lover, Cecil Fenwick, who mysteriously materializes in Avonlea a short time later. Another amusing story. >> \\"Her Father's Daughter\\" -- A young woman invites her estranged father to her wedding against her mother's wishes. I thought their first meeting was slightly inappropriate, especially with the father asking for a kiss and hugging her when the girl wasn't aware of who he was. Not to mention the ending was a tad too contrived and sappy, though the daughter did show some backbone at least. >> \\"Jane's Baby\\" -- Two elderly, estranged sisters fight over possession of an orphaned child, even resorting to kidnapping. >> \\"The Dream-Child\\" -- The ghost of a young couple's 20-month-old baby returns to haunt them. An eerie, more darker story than the rest, but very good. I liked this one especially.<br />\\"The Brother Who Failed\\" -- A family reunion is spoiled for one older man who is thought to be a failure by his Aunt Isabel, while his siblings are more successful with money and fame. >> \\"The Return of Hester\\" -- A young woman's difficult promise to her dying older sister of not marrying a certain man is revoked when her sister's ghost returns to play matchmaker. The ending was a bit abrupt. >> \\"The Little Brown Book of Miss Emily\\" -- After an unpopular old maid dies, she leaves Anne Shirley her diary in order for Anne and Diane to understand her. While Anne is mentioned in a couple other stories, it was nice to read from her perspective again, like in the Anne of Green Gables series, if only for a short bit, since the majority of the story is just diary excerpts. >> \\"Sara's Way\\" -- A young teacher's meddlesome two aunts try and push her to marry a well-to-do man against her wishes. But when his family suffers from financial trouble, she comes to his defense. >> \\"The Son of His Mother\\" -- An overly-possessive mother grows upset over her grown son's interest in another woman. This woman is obviously disturbed, and it's hard to like her, even with the story told from her point of view. Not one of the best here, and a bit too long.<br />\\"The Education of Betty\\" -- A man offers to help his childhood sweetheart, a recent widow, in raising her wild 10-year-old daughter. After some time, he begins to develop unguardian-like feelings for the girl. This story almost felt like a G-rated Edwardian version of \\"Lolita.\\" >> \\"In Her Selfless Mood\\" -- A young woman promises her dying mother that she'll care for her halfbrother. Readers will empathize with her, but question why she's so loyal to a family that dislikes her. >> \\"The Conscience Case of David Bell\\" -- A father's refusal to testify at their revivalist church makes his family feel disgraced. Not one of the best here. >> \\"Only a Common Fellow\\" -- A young bride's supposedly dead childhood sweetheart returns just in the nick of time on her wedding day. Romantics should like this one. >> \\"Tannis of the Flats\\" -- A multiracial woman's trip to Canada's Northwest ends in heartbreak when she falls for an English man who doesn't love her but another woman. There are some rather prejudiced remarks concerning Indians/Native Americans in this story, like referring to them as simple-minded \\"breeds\\" and stating that half-breeds are the worst enemy in the world--and that's just the beginning.<br />Despite this ending story (and a couple others), \\"Further Chronicles of Avonlea\\" is a suitable read for everyone. I bought this book sometime when I was 9 or 10 and have enjoyed it ever since. Though this isn't a classic collection, diehard L. M.

In \\"Slumber Party,\\" 17-year-old Lara Johnson (the protagonist) and her five girl friends (Celeste Winston, Dana Miller, Rachael Grayson, Nell Kutroff, and Mindy Casey) travel to Cedar Stream, California, for a weekend ski trip. Shortly after they arrive, strange and dangerous things start to occur: a snowman mysteriously melts; Dana goes missing, leaving unusual ski tracks in the snow--both events leading Lara to a \\"supernatural hypothesis\\"--and then Mindy's arm gets seriously burned in the fireplace. What it all leads back to is a fiery slumber party eight years ago when one of them was disfigured and her sister died. And someone wants to make sure they never forget it.<br />\\"Slumber Party\\" wasn't quite as engaging as some of Pike's later books (I think this is his first published book under this pseudonym), but it was still a fast-paced mind twister, with a little bit of romance thrown in between Lara and a 22-year-old guy (Percy Chand) she meets at the lodge. It vaguely reminded me of \\"Weekend\\" (the book published just after this one), because of its conspiratorial vacation setup; though instead of heading South, this one heads for the slopes. If you've read \\"Weekend,\\" then you may be able to uncover the mystery in \\"Slumber Party\\" a little quicker. This is certainly worth picking up if you're a Pike fan and/or like teen suspense.	2003-10-12

After reading the synopsis, I was expecting something a little smutty, possibly along the lines of an old Dean Koontz novel. I was impressed that it wasn't so superficial.<br />The book's about Rose Carpenter (a 25-year-old New York painter/part-time cocktail waitress with psychic powers) who becomes involved in a dream telepathy session with Jack Squadron (a 33-year-old married composer, who later becomes her lover), which is conducted by Dr. Reese Cindrella, a parapsychologist. During this time, two of her friends die. She witnesses it happening in her mind, of them being raped and murdered. The suspects point to the leading men in her life: Dr. Cindrella, Jack, and a mysterious third man, her stalker. But which one is it? And can she figure it out before she either goes insane or gets killed herself?<br />\\"Nocturnal\\" is a well-written, vividly gripping paranormal horror book. The identity of the killer is hard to guess. The reader will want to suspect one character, change his/her mind a second later, then continue guessing as the clues keep unraveling. The epilogue is certainly jolting and leaves several questions unanswered, namely: Was the wrong man fingered? \\"Nocturnal\\" should definitely hold the interest of any reader who's into this genre.	2003-10-09

This is the fourth and final book in The Secret Books of Paradys series (preceded by &quot;The Book of the Damned&quot; [#1], &quot;The Book of the Beast&quot; [#2], and &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot; [#3]), and it is, without a doubt, my favorite book in the group. It alternates between three various-spelled parallel cities:<br />--Paradise, where Felion and Smara (homicidal twin outcasts), travel through their uncle's space-altering ice labyrinth, in order to kill an unknown cousin for their own personal gain.<br />--Paradis, where Leocadia, a 30-year-old alcoholic, bisexual painter, is blamed for her lover's murder and is sent to an asylum by her conniving relatives. Leocadia is devilishly witty, though Felion and Smara still win out for me.<br />--Paradys, where Hilde, a 15-year-old virgin, is raped by Johanos Martin, an actor she adores. She becomes hysterical afterwards and is sent to an asylum by her parents, who can't cope. This is the least memorable of the three stories, at least it was for me, but it's still interesting enough.<br />These three well-crafted stories tie-in to one another as the book progresses, culminating in a terrific ending. Fans of this series will enjoy rereading this book over again, if not to just pick up pieces of the puzzle, which are skillfully strewn around. It's mesmerizing, and dark fantasy at its best. Highly recommended.	2003-10-07

Fast paced, but ending left wide open.<br />\\"Like a Bug on a Windshield\\" by Lawrence Block -- A truck driver fears he may have given a fellow trucker the idea to run other vehicles off the road. This one will definitely have readers looking twice at truckers. >> \\"Bless This House\\" by Christianna Brand -- An unsubtle story set in England about a young carpenter, a pregnant virgin, and the woman who lets them stay in her shed. >> \\"The Gun\\" by Ann Carol -- A brief interrogation by two detectives of a teen boy who had found a gun in a parking lot. Surprising ending. You might have to read it twice to get it, like I had to.<br />\\"Lucky Dip\\" by Liza Cody -- A homeless girl pickpockets a corpse, unaware of what she's stolen. Very good story, but the ending left me wanting more. >> \\"Death of the Right Fielder\\" by Stuart Dybek -- The title says it all: a young right fielder mysteriously dies while playing baseball.

Loose ending, but a good moral about trying--and failing--to be someone you're not.<br />\\"Kim's Game\\" by M. D. Lake -- A summer camp game teaches a girl how to solve a counselor's murder. Well written, though the motive is unanswered. >> \\"Darker than Just Before the Dawn\\" by John H. MaGowan -- A woman reads of several serial murders in an out-of-town newspaper. You almost feel sorry for the protagonist, despite her role in the story. >> \\"Late Developments\\" by Terry Mullins -- A young man witnesses a mob murder and helps to solve it.<br />\\"The Premonition\\" by Joyce Carol Oates -- A man has a premonition to visit his brother's family during Christmas. Kind of a creepy holiday story. The reader will have to read between the lines to understand what happened to the man's brother. >> \\"The Maltese Cat\\" by Sara Paretsky -- A private investigator looks for her client's runaway sister. Longest story here, but pretty good. >> Two young men play a nocturnal death-sport called \\"The Werewolf Game\\" (by Mauricio-Jose Schwarz).<br />\\"Mother Always Loved You Best\\" by Barbara Steiner -- A young woman soon realizes her dead twin sister isn't dead. Twisted story; read like a Point Thriller. >> \\"Just Lather, That's All\\" by Hernando Tellez -- When a rebel-hunter enters a revolutionaries' barbershop for a shave, the barber debates about killing him.

I really didn't know very much about the whole Arthurian legend, but I was interested in Paganism at the time, so I decided to give it a try. Even after all this time, I'm still impressed by this book. However, I wasn't about to reread it in order to write this review, because, if I remember right, it took me a couple months to finish it, seeing as how it's nearly 900 pages. But I'll try to recap as best as I can, starting with a phrase that pretty much sums up a major theme in &quot;Mists&quot;: Behind every great man stands a great woman. Or, in this case, about four great women, all of whom are relatives of King Arthur's in some way: Morgan (his half-sister &amp; lover), Viviane (his aunt), Igraine (his mother), and Guinevere (his wife). Yet the story is primarily shown through the eyes of Morgan and Guinevere, two complete opposites of each other--Morgan being the yin (dark Pagan energy), while Guinevere is the yang (light Christian energy). Out of the two, Morgan was definitely my favorite; Guinevere was just utterly annoying. Separately, these two try to sway the power and balance in Avalon via King Arthur. If you're familiar with Arthurian myth, then I don't have to explain further; but if not, it couldn't hurt you to pick up a copy--that is, unless you drop this 2-pound epic on your toes. ;)<br />Almost 20 years after it was published, &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; was made into a movie in 2001, starring some of my favorite actresses (Anjelica Huston being one of them). I haven't seen it yet, but from what I've heard, I haven't missed much. Still, I'd  recommend it if you enjoyed the book (Hint: read the book first). I'd also recommend the other two Avalon books by Bradley: &quot;Lady of Avalon&quot; and &quot;The Forest House.&quot; You don't have to be an Arthurian/fantasy buff to enjoy this book, but you do need a great deal of patience to finish it.	2003-08-29

The masculine names are in the first half; the feminine ones in the second half, both listed in alphabetical order with their origin, meaning, variant spellings, pet names, etc. However, there's no pronunciation, which makes it a little difficult if you've never heard the name before. But, overall, this is a terrific book for any type of use--from choosing names for your baby/pet/what have you (I use it as a writing tool, for creating characters) to common genealogy use.	2003-08-12

Published just before the turn of the century--when quite a few people were contemplating the Apocalypse (I wasn't one of them)--\\"Bangs & Whimpers\\" does a great job of offering 19 various scenarios about the end of the world, as summarized below:<br />\\"The Nine Billion Names of God\\" by Arthur C. Clarke -- A Tibetan monastery uses a computer to find \\"all the possible names of God\\", in order to discover His purpose. >> \\"Killing the Morrow\\" by Robert Reed -- An omnipresent voice instructs people to hatch human-like embryos in their homes--but for what purpose? >> \\"We Can Get Them for You Wholesale\\" by Neil Gaiman -- A man hires a hit man to kill his fiancee's lover, but being unable to pass up a bargain, he gets a little in over his head. Without a doubt, my favorite story here. Love the ending. >> \\"Fire Catcher\\" by Richard Kadrey -- A military assassin plays his part in the Apocalyptic third World War. >> \\"Not with a Bang\\" by Howard Fast -- One evening, a man sees the sun get snuffed out, proclaiming to \\"The Hollow Men\\" quote: \\"This is the way the world ends / not with a bang but a whimper.\\" >> \\"Lost and Found\\" by Connie Willis -- The search for a church school teacher's missing cup turns up a far more important utensil.<br />\\"The Wind and the Rain\\" by Robert Silverberg -- A group of futuristic scientists visits a destroyed Earth in order to restore it. >> \\"The Year of the Jackpot\\" by Robert A. Heinlein -- A statistician tries to prove his point that the incidents in our world occur in cycles. Feels more like a novella than a short story, but it does pick up at the end. >> \\"Expendable\\" by Philip K. Dick -- A man, unlucky enough to learn the truth about an army of ants, becomes their next prime target. Quite amusing in a surreal sort of way. >> \\"Finis\\" by Frank L. Pollack -- With the arrival of a new star in the Earth's galaxy comes the unexpected, fiery end for this world, which was a nice change of pace, since most of the authors in here rely on the freezing factor.>> \\"A Guide to Virtual Death\\" by J. G. Ballard -- A brief, 3-paged TV itinerary proves that television is one of man's most destructive tools. >> \\"Emissary from a Green and Yellow World\\" by Robert Sheckley -- An alien from a distant planet comes to the President of the U.S. with a warning--that the sun is going to nova in 150 years and all the people of Earth must prepare for escape.<br />\\"The Portable Phonograph\\" by Walter Van Tilburg Clark -- Set in a post-holocaustic winter, four men connect with the past via a portable phonograph. Very flowery writing, almost too much so. >> \\"Fermi and Frost\\" by Frederik Pohl -- A nuclear attack leaves the world scrambling for shelter. >> \\"Ultimate Construction\\" by C. C. Shackleton -- A 2-paged story in which sand covers the face of the Earth. >> \\"The Manhattan Phone Book (Abridged)\\" by John Varley -- Several paragraph-long bios of people in the Manhattan phone book, just before a bomb kills them all. Strange, morbidly humorous story. I liked it. >> \\"The Man who Walked Home\\" by James Tiptree, Jr. -- A \\"monster\\" in a crater makes his annual appearances as the world changes around him. Confusing. >> \\"Interview with a Lemming\\" by James Thurber -- The title explains it all: a scientist's 3-page conversation with a lemming. >> \\"The Last Question\\" by Isaac Asimov -- Over time, a computer is asked the same question of how to reverse entropy. An appropriate ending to this book.<br />I've never been very interested in science fiction, or end-of-the-world stuff for that matter, but I do like a few of the writers in \\"Bangs & Whimpers\\" (Neil Gaiman, for instance), so I had to give it a try. Overall, the book was pretty good. It became a little heavy and dismal at times (but what do you expect from a book about \\"the end?\\")--though there are a few humorous exceptions, like \\"We Can Get Them for You Wholesale,\\" \\"Expendable,\\" and \\"The Manhattan Phone Book (Abridged)\\" (all favorites of mine).	2003-08-09

This one takes place on a South Carolina family plantation (Sea Oaks), which is located on Devereaux Island. It's here that 40-year-old Kevin Devereaux has returned with his wife and two children (15-year-old Julie and 8-year-old Jeff), to visit his cruel, dying mother.<br />But shortly after their arrival, the grandmother dies, leaving an odd twist in her will that forces them to remain at Sea Oaks or they won't inherit anything. However, that doesn't seem to be a problem, seeing as how someone intends on making sure they cannot leave the island either way--dead or alive.<br />As one reviewer mentioned, &quot;The Unloved&quot; does have a slight V. C. Andrews/&quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; feel to it in more ways than one. For starters, Marguerite Devereaux (Kevin's older sister) has an odd similarity to the deceased author--she lives with her elderly mother, is slightly crippled and interested in ballet--not to mention two common threads seen in most V. C. Andrews books: a Southern setting and abusive home life (though none of Andrews' incest exists here; Saul exchanges that for blood and violence).<br />I did like this book--the setting was particularly descriptive--however, it was rather obvious who the killer was halfway through it, so no major surprise there. Even though it's been years since I've read this book, it's not one I'd necessarily re-read by Saul (unless I was really, really bored)--but it is one I'd recommend to horror fans.	2003-08-07

Seventeen-year-old Toni West is new to Clear River, Florida, and eager to find a summer job. So, when she answers a want ad and is hired to baby-sit an 11-year-old kid (William Southerland) for two weeks, she thinks she's got it made. Unfortunately, the exact opposite is true. After receiving several threatening crank calls and finding a dead pet in the pool, she's ready to call it quits and go home--but someone won't let her leave alive. (Hmm, I wonder who...)<br />\\"The Evil Child\\" is kind of slow, and certainly predictable. I mean, the reader already knows who the bad guy by reading the title alone. This second addition to the Baby-sitter's Nightmares series isn't as good as the first one (\\"Alone in the Dark\\" by Daniel Parker), but it is worth checking out if you like teen horror, as well as the other two: \\"Lights Outs\\" by Bernard O'Keane and \\"A Killer in the House\\" by J.

It takes place in New York City, where two 17-year-old girls--Eliza \\"Liza\\" Winthrop (the protagonist) and Annie Kenyon--meet one day in a museum and pretty much fall in love at first sight, though their relationship starts out as \\"just friends\\". But, gradually, during their museum visits and medieval improvs, it develops into more--and, not surprisingly, there's a homophobic reaction to it, particularly at Liza's school (Foster Academy).<br />Though \\"Annie on My Mind\\" is considered YA fiction, I'd recommend this book to adults as well, and not just lesbian/gay readers. I'm neither, yet I was quite moved by this story. Nancy Garden is a talented writer, and draws the reader right into Liza and Annie's world--their feelings, doubts, etc.--with such depth, it's hard not to be moved by this book. All around, this is a remarkable story worth checking out. Recommended.	2003-08-03

Plus the reader already knows what's going to happen, so it's hard to feel the same excitement she does over this \\"Southern gentleman.\\"<br />There were a few things that bothered me about this book, though the first one can't be changed--like why didn't Nancy's mother take her to a doctor a.s.a.p. in the event of a pregnancy? Topics like this one--along with loads of other useful information in regards to rape, HIV/AIDS, etc.--are included in the remaining 20 pages or so of this book. That alone makes \\"It Happened to Nancy\\" worth buying, though the story itself is very touching too.<br />Yet the biggest thing that bothered me about this book was how much of it was censored by Sparks (who also edited \\"Go Ask Alice\\")--or possibly by Nancy's parents--perhaps to \\"protect\\" younger readers from some of the mature content. Either way, it makes the story uneven and confusing at times.<br />Although the reader can guess how the book will end, that's not the real purpose of it. Instead, it's to \\"educate and enlighten adults and perhaps safeguard some young people\\" from this happening to them. This book is definitely worth having in every school library.	2003-07-28

For three weeks, 17-year-old Gretchen Childs is responsible for baby-sitting 7-year-old Adam Wollman in his parent's mansion in Madison, California. Gretchen thinks it'll be a piece of cake. That is, until she realizes 1) Adam's psychic, and 2) he's in danger.<br />A short time later her ex-boyfriend is found dead in the Wollmans' Jacuzzi--and she's the number one suspect for his murder. Now, not only are they on the run from the police, but Gretchen must protect Adam--as well as her friends--from a group of sorcerers that want to exploit Adam's gift in order to fulfill a centuries-old prophecy.<br />The majority of the book takes place in the nearby woods, which gives the book an isolated, spooky feel. The ending is kind of left up in the air for a possible sequel (though there isn't one); but young fans of occult suspense should like this first book in the Baby-sitter's Nightmares series, as well as the other three: \\"The Evil Child\\" (#2) by M.

In this book, Tia Ramirez is trying to act like the super-hero and cure him of his developing alcoholism--which is basically the same run-around from the past few books, with Tia meddling in his life and Conner acting like he has something--possibly his favorite vodka bottle?--permanently wedged sideways up his--um, hindquarters.<br />And then on to one of my favorite love triangles involving Jade Wu, Jessica Wakefield, and Jeremy Aames--and now it looks like there's a fourth \\"J\\" member: Josh Radinsky (Lila Fowler's ex). Even though Jade's currently dating Jeremy, she's also seeing Josh on the side--which is just the kind of news Jessica is eager to hear, since it might bring Jeremy back to her.<br />Although Jade isn't one of my favorite characters (she's almost the equivalent of Melissa Fox in my book), I had to laugh at her \\"Guys I'd Like to Hook Up With\\" list on page 125. I definitely couldn't blame her for putting Gavin Rossdale on there. :)<br />And speaking of the above-mentioned Miss Fox, it looks like a football scout from the University of Michigan (a school Will Simmons really wants to attend) is showing an interest in his sports ability. But since he and Melissa want to go to the same college--and Melissa is more interested in USC--there's some static between these two, which could develop into more in the following book, \\"Nothing is Forever.\\"<br />Overall, \\"It's My Life\\" is a good addition to this series. The ending was particularly good, involving some major changes with the four J's--Jade, Jeremy, Jessica, and Josh--and Conner and his party pals.	2003-07-23

On his way to school one day, 11-year-old Billy Williams is handed his death in the subway--a bomb concealed in a package. Following his death, his family (Americans living in London, England)--as well as the city--are on guard and afraid. His 16-year-old sister, Laura Williams, who becomes the main character of the book, obsesses over this terrorist act, thinking: \\"What if Billy's killer was somebody at school? Somebody right here at L.I.A. [London International Academy]?\\" And so begins her investigation into her brother's tragic death.<br />However, the book kind of detours from her quest about halfway through, when one of Laura's Moslem girl friends begs her to help her run away from her strict family. Yet \\"The Terrorist\\" is just as gripping and realistic as some of Cooney's other books, like her Janie series (which I really liked). It has a great deal of impact on everyone since it focuses on global terrorism, a topic that has been rampant in the news for a long time.<br />But aside from the serious part of the story, \\"The Terrorist\\" is a good intro to English culture--as well as other cultures--as seen through the eyes of an American family. It's a very insightful and fast-paced book (I read it in one day), though the bad guy is kind of obvious. Recommended to Cooney fans.	2003-07-22

As Nina explains, each move is harder than the one before, because she has to uproot herself from her friends, boyfriends, and school. And like before, just as Nina's getting used to her surroundings--she joins the girls' basketball team and develops a crush on a classmate (Sam Gordon)--her mother insists they move again, this time to Logan, Utah, where Nina's the new kid all over again.<br />Throughout the book, Nina is confused by her mother's unpredictable moods and whims to move. No explanation is given for why they have to travel so often, but the reader begins to suspect that they're running away from something--or someone. The tension builds slowly as Nina and her mother move to Venice, California, then Brooklyn, New York, where a startling secret is finally revealed about Nina's mother.<br />\\"Where It Stops, Nobody Knows\\" is a great book for teens, particularly girls. I could relate to Nina since I moved a lot as a kid, and readers who have as well will probably like this book, too. Yet even readers who haven't moved around a lot can still empathize with her, since the author does a great job of drawing her out. Recommended.	2003-07-15

During the summer, all three girls go to Carrie's father's cabin in Watson River, California, to celebrate Carrie's 16th birthday. Two of the girls (Carrie and Zane) have summer crushes on two guys that can't stand each other, while M.B. is left in the shadows for most of the time, which accounts for a lot of their arguments. By the end of the book, though, they reassess their friendships with each other (Zane and M.B., in particular), and for Carrie, her relationship with her dad, which isn't as strong as she had imagined it to be. Overall: \\"Sweet Sixteen\\" is a good summer romance read for teens.	2003-07-10

Popular 17-year-old Connie Lewis is friends with Mara Kreiger, an overweight reject at their New York high school--but when one of Connie's friends steals Mara's idea for a charity bake sale, Connie soon becomes a target when Mara plans to poison everyone at the event as revenge. If it's not obvious, Mara's a little off her rocker; but the reader could have guessed as much by reading the synopsis, as well as the tagline on the back cover: \\"Beware of Geeks Bearing Gifts\\" (which got a laugh out of me).<br />A bit of romance is thrown into the seemingly transparent plot, involving a Romeo and Juliet scenario between Connie and Taylor Hall, the drug addict her father forbids her to associate with. It's not very significant to the story, but it does connect with the twist at the end, when the killer is revealed--though the twist isn't very surprising. Still, \\"Pat-A-Cake, Pat-A-Cake\\" is a pretty good addition to the Nursery Crimes series, which includes two others: \\"Jack and Jill\\" and \\"There Was An Old Woman\\"--both worth checking out if you liked this one.	2003-06-28

She doesn't believe any of the deaths are suicides, but murders made to look self-inflicted. And since she was loosely involved with the first victim, Erika takes it on herself to start investigating the surge of unexplained \\"suicides.\\" What she uncovers, though, is a lot more complicated than she ever could have imagined, involving several dark secrets kept by her high school teachers and classmates.<br />\\"Dangerous Secrets\\" is a terrific, fast-paced book. It jumps right into the story from page one, and keeps the reader guessing until the very end (though the ending is kind of a letdown). Erika's a great, well-developed protagonist/amateur sleuth, and could give Nancy Drew a run for her money any day. This book is definitely worth reading if you like YA suspense/horror.	2003-06-22

Dave Barry starts it off with the first chapter (comically entitled &quot;Booger&quot;), then Les Standiford takes on the next one, followed by the 11 other mystery writers: Paul Levine, Edna Buchanan, James W. Hall, Carolina Hospital, Evelyn Mayerson, Tananarive Due, Brian Antoni, Vicki Hendricks, John Dufresne, Elmore Leonard, and Carl Hiaasen.<br />Basically, &quot;Naked Came the Manatee&quot; is about a decapitated head--Fidel Castro's, to be exact--that's found in a metal canister floating in the water. From there, about half a dozen main characters (though only two stick out in my mind a day later: a 102-year-old woman and a manatee named Booger) are either trying to solve the mystery or just trying to stay alive--or both.<br />I honestly didn't know what to expect from this book when I bought it, even though a librarian recommended it to me. The idea of collaborative writing didn't seem like a good idea, especially with so many writers battling for the helm of the story. I noticed a few authors even backtracked to cover up other author's plot holes or mistakes, even added a few unnecessary characters. The result is kind of a mess. It doesn't have very smooth chapter transitions, and felt more like a collage rather than a work of art. The Florida setting was descriptive, yet at the same time very unflattering (didn't make me want to visit, especially after reading Brian Antoni's chapter).<br />The one good thing about &quot;Naked Came the Manatee,&quot; though, is that it's short (approximately 200 pages), which makes for light reading. Still, this isn't one I'd necessarily recommend, unless you're a fan of one or more of the authors mentioned above.	2003-06-18

It involves five major \\"dark predators\\" (vampires, wraiths, mages, werewolves, and changelings) and takes place in the 'strange city' of San Francisco, California, where the majority of these stories occur. Of the 14 stories, about half are vampire-oriented, like the first one: \\"Dancing with the Devil\\" by Keith \\"Doc\\" Herber, where a vampire--in the company of his ghoul and Childe--searches for a lost soul to \\"save.\\" This one is rich in San Francisco history, but the ending is rather disappointing, mainly because the vamp doesn't get his chance to use his large collection of Spanish Inquisition torture tools that were needlessly mentioned at the beginning of the story.<br />The other thirteen stories are as follows:<br />\\"Hunter's Blues\\" by Scott Ciencin -- A werewolf/blues guitarist seeks revenge against the two assassins that killed his pack. Some musical aspects to the story. >> \\"Glimpses of Before\\" by John H. Steele -- Lots of detail about a man's life remembered after death. Depressing, a bit long-winded. >> \\"The Voice of the Hummingbird\\" by S. P. Somtow -- The longest short story here (41 pages). Like \\"Dancing with the Devil,\\" it's full of ancient history, this time about the Aztecs, in particular a mummified Aztec vampire that comes back to life and tells his story to a museum curator. >> \\"The Bye-Bye Club\\" by Ray Winninger -- An orphan boy enters a children's club that's driven by murder. Good story (nice and short), but the ending's a bit too abrupt. >> \\"The Way It Goes\\" by Thomas Kane -- When an assassin botches an assignment, he goes on the run for fear of being killed himself. My favorite Wraith story. >> A homeless young woman meets a Toreador vampire in a coffee shop and discovers he's the author of one of her favorite poetry chapbooks, entitled \\"The Scarlet Letters\\" (by Scott H. Urban). My favorite Vampire story. >> \\"Descent\\" by Sam Chupp -- A Tremere's lesbian lover is abducted and used to lure her into a pact with the Sabbat.<br />\\"Wolf Trap\\" by Richard Lee Byers -- A werewolf is hired to bust a mental patient out of an asylum, but ends up getting trapped on the grounds instead. My favorite Werewolf story. >> \\"Shards\\" by Phil Brucato -- A young werewolf is outcast from her pack, as well as dumped by her human boyfriend. Short, quick story. Not too sure about the point of it, though, if there is one. >> \\"Rootbound\\" by R. S. Martin -- An obsessed man creates the image of a woman he loves out of wood and roots. Surreal, descriptive writing. Not a lot of action though. >> \\"The Art of Dying\\" by Lawrence Watt-Evans -- A vampire attempts to Embrace a talented artist into the Toreador clan, though another vamp wants him as well. As mentioned in the story, it's like the story of Solomon and the two mothers fighting over a baby. Good ending. >> \\"The Waters of Lethe\\" by Bill Bridges -- During several sessions with a psychologist, a man with amnesia tries to piece together his past. >> \\"Power\\" by Don Bassingthwaite -- A Ventrue forensic pathologist gets involved in one too many murder cover-ups. Good finale.<br />Most of the stories in \\"Strange City\\" are relatively bloody and gruesome (no splatterpunk though), which should appeal to most horror fans, but particularly to readers who have some familiarity with one or more of the WoD games. Of course, you don't need to be an expert (I'm certainly not), but it does help. As mentioned in the intro of this book, readers who are \\"in the know\\" of storytelling games like Vampire: The Masquerade, Werewolf: The Apocalypse, and Wraith: The Oblivion will probably enjoy this \\"game fiction\\" anthology a lot more than the average horror reader.	2003-06-14

It's here, on the island of Martha's Vineyard, that Freeman falls in love with Sheila Hanrahan-Van Anda, a married woman who visits him one day with an injured eye. Right away it's love at first sight, so to speak, when Freeman, in a desperate attempt to remove the object, does so by licking her eyeball--which is either an erotic or disgusting gesture, depending on the reader.<br />From that first meeting, Freeman and Sheila have an affair that spans approximately 25 years and takes place all over the globe--from Martha's Vineyard to Paris, London, and Japan. About two-thirds of \\"A Thousand Summers\\" is a love story; the remaining third is mainly the aftermath of their relationship and how Freeman copes with it. The book is a little unbelievable in regards to their idealistic relationship. They *never* fight and are endlessly happy being together for years on end. The reader just has to accept these little quirks; otherwise, the story won't be as enjoyable.<br />Overall, \\"A Thousand Summers\\" is an easy to read, relatively fast-paced romance (no gratuitous sex scenes here). However, there's no major plot or conflict. In fact, Freeman and Sheila's affair isn't all that shocking or taboo, especially since neither one feels guilty about it, nor do their spouses really care. The ending wasn't too terribly impressive either. After more than 100 pages, the author must have realized that nothing very dramatic had happened and decided to just tack on a separate story line, which didn't have a lot--if anything--to do with their affair.

Not only that, but Artie's wife and stepson have suddenly disappeared, just at the crucial moment when someone has been trying to kill him, as well as the people he associates with because of what they know.<br />After some time, what Artie and his friends soon discover is that a centuries-old species of human (called the Old People) have been waiting all this time for Homo sapiens to exterminate themselves off the planet. But for fear of being revealed and destroyed themselves, the Old People decide to declare a covert war on Homo sapiens in order to reclaim domination of the world.<br />When I started reading \\"Waiting,\\" I checked out a few reviews at Amazon beforehand to see what others thought of it. I was only a few chapters into it, but I really liked it so far and was quite surprised by all the low reviews of it. When I picked the book back up, I kept expecting it to get worse like several reviewers had said. However, it didn't. I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end. It's not very high on action, but it is quite thought-provoking on our existence in the next century or so, as possibly the next endangered species on Earth.<br />\\"Waiting\\" reminded me a little of something Dean Koontz would write, minus any sci-fi nonsense, which I kept expecting since it was published by Tor, a sci-fi-heavy publisher. It's a well-written thriller, and if you like such novels, then you'll probably like \\"Waiting.\\"	2003-06-06

Even though the Caretaker (Neil Hurly) died in the previous book, the remaining six high school graduates--except for Alison Parker--start receiving the same kind of chain letter from someone who claims to be the Caretaker. Again, most everyone thinks it's someone playing a sick joke. But when two of them are brutally killed  because they refused to follow the Caretaker's orders, the remaining friends are in a hurry to unmask the identity of the killer before s/he has a chance to kill again. (The identity of the Caretaker is relatively easy to guess because of some of the clues and added characters.)<br />\\"The Ancient Evil\\" is more of a supernatural horror book than \\"Chain Letter,\\" involving things like the occult/Satanism, which the other book had none of. The Caretaker's instructions in this book are a lot more violent, too--like drown your puppy, burn your sister's arm, and cut off your finger. Because of these things, \\"The Ancient Evil\\" is a little better than the first, in my opinion. Plus this book answers some of the questions about the man in the desert they accidentally killed. The ending here is also more up to Pike's style than how the first \\"Chain Letter\\" ended. This is definitely a must-read if you read and enjoyed the first book in this series.	2003-06-03

Here Teddy is almost eaten by a crocodile, runs into a lion at their campsite, and even helps heal an elephant's toothache.<br />I read &quot;Teddy's Trip to Africa&quot; a lot when I was a kid, along with the following book in this series: &quot;Teddy's Birthday Party.&quot; Young elementary children should like this one, especially if they're animal lovers.	2003-05-30

Or You Will Suffer..."	\\"Chain Letter\\" is somewhat similar to Lois Duncan's \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\\" involving a hit and run, and Pike's two books: \\"Last Act\\" (relating to a high school play) and \\"Weekend\\" (similar group ending). Prior to receiving a threatening chain letter, all seven friends (Alison Parker, Fran Darey, Brenda Paxson, Kipp Coughlan, Tony Hunt, Neil Hurly, and Joan Zuchlensky) were involved in a hit and run. They buried the body of the anonymous man in the California desert, and a short time later, they began receiving instructions from someone (\\"the Caretaker\\") who knows about their past. And if they don't follow these orders--like desecrating the school mascot, purposely flunking a test, publicly embarrassing several teachers, streaking naked at school, and burning down the school--they could all end up dead.<br />Christopher Pike is, without a doubt, one of my favorite YA writers. I've been reading and re-reading his books for about 15 years now. Though his books are geared for teenagers, they're intelligent and complex enough to satisfy most adult suspense readers as well (speaking as one). The pace in \\"Chain Letter\\" isn't quite as smooth as some of his others, though, but it's still a pretty good teen thriller. Worth reading if you're a Pike fan, in addition to the sequel: \\"Chain Letter 2: The Ancient Evil.\\"	2003-05-28

In reaction to a blizzard that hits Stoneybrook, Connecticut, the seven BSC members--with the guidance of Kristy Thomas--decide to write about their separate blizzard experiences in a group article for 'The Stoneybrook News.' \\"Snowbound\\" is the result of that.<br />During the blizzard, everyone gets stranded someplace overnight--Jessi Ramsey at her ballet school; Mallory Pike and Mary Anne Spier at Mal's house, while baby-sitting the Pike kids; Stacey McGill and her mother in their car alongside a deserted road; Kristy Thomas and her boyfriend, Bart, at her house; Claudia Kishi at the Perkinses' (her baby-sitting clients); and Dawn Schafer and her mother at the airport. While most of them are without power and the use of phones, they're relatively safe compared to Stacey, who is stranded in a car with no heat and gas--and no possible way of getting help if her diabetes gets out of hand.<br />What I liked the most about \\"Snowbound\\"--as well as every other Super Special--is that the point of view changes with each new chapter. Plus the journal entries at the beginning of each chapter are a nice touch.<br />This is a great Super Special addition to the Baby-sitters Club series. BSC fans should like this one, particularly 8 to 12-year-old readers who like snow adventures set during the winter holidays. If you've already read and enjoyed \\"Snowbound,\\" then you'll probably like \\"Super Special #3: Baby-sitters' Winter Vacation\\" as well.	2003-05-26

When Lizzie Miletti's best friend's mother goes out of town for a couple of weeks, Lizzie thinks it's fantastic since Nancy Underpeace gets to stay at her place during that time. Yet just days after Nancy arrives, Lizzie starts to think it might have been a mistake when Nancy starts doing things that really get on her nerves--like going to bed and waking up early, insisting on sleeping in a pitch-black room, and spending more time with Lizzie's siblings than with her. Not only that, but Lizzie feels like she's doing all the work on their puppet show for the school fair. Even though they're best friends, will they still be after the two weeks are up?<br />Though \\"The Roommate\\" is written under the name Carrie Randall, the book is actually written by Carol Ellis, author of several other YA books, like the following Scholastic Thrillers: \\"The Stepdaughter,\\" \\"The Window,\\" and \\"The Body.\\"<br />If you enjoyed this book, then I'd recommend reading the other five Dear Diary books: \\"The Party\\" (#1), \\"The Secret\\" (#2), \\"The Dance\\" (#3), \\"The Mystery\\" (#4), and \\"The Lie\\" (#6). Recommended for 8 to 12-year-old readers.	2003-05-23

Books	5	3	3	N	N	A Fun YA Book on 'Nose-Picking'	Ok, I'll admit it: The title of this book was what made me buy it. Real mature of me, right? However, \\"Can You Teach Me to Pick My Nose?\\" doesn't have anything to do with digging for gold (well, except for one instance at the end); 'nose-picking' is a skateboarding term.<br />The book should appeal to the preteen crowd, in particular young males since the protagonist, 7th-grader Jordy Shepherd, is in the same boat as most guys--he's trying to impress a popular girl at school, Marissa Powell. And somehow he's found himself in a skateboard competition with her older brother, Steve. Unfortunately, Jordy doesn't know the first thing about skating; so, he seeks the help of an unpopular classmate--and skateboarding pro--Pamela Loseth, in order to survive the competition in one piece.<br />As the title would suggest, this book is a lot of fun. It's ideal for young people who don't want to read very much (it's only 121 pages), and especially for readers interested in skateboarding.	2003-05-21

In the hopes of improving their luck, one of Ti An's friends brings a good-luck teddy bear to their competition. However, it disappears a short time later, and soon the Pinecones start accusing each other of taking it.<br />I felt bad for Ti An concerning the way her father pressures her for perfection in this book. But at least by the end of \\"Mystery at the Meet\\" they're able to come together and solve the missing teddy bear mystery. This is a good book/series for young readers (age 8 - 12) who like gymnastics.	2003-05-19

It only covers the first five books in this series, though (\\"Interview With the Vampire\\", \\"The Vampire Lestat\\", \\"The Queen of the Damned\\", \\"The Tale of the Body Thief\\", and \\"Memnoch the Devil\\"), which may bother more die hard Vampire fans. Information on the other four books (\\"The Vampire Armand\\", \\"Merrick\\", \\"Blood and Gold\\", and \\"Blackwood Farm\\") is obviously missing since they were published after this book.<br />Just about everything's included in this mammoth 500+-paged book: maps, illustrations and photos, bits of Anne Rice information, a time line, in-depth character biographies, etc. Even the unpublished short story of \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" is included, which originated the novel one year later.<br />If you're an Anne Rice fan--and especially if you enjoyed the Vampire Chronicles--then I highly recommend this official reference guide to her popular vampire series, even though it only covers half the books in the series. (Hopefully, there will be another revised edition published soon.) But for what it does cover, \\"The Vampire Companion\\" is very thorough and worthwhile to Vampire fans. This is certainly a book worth owning, since it answers just about every question you've ever had about this series and then some.<br />Also recommended: Katherine Ramsland's \\"The Witches' Companion.\\"	2003-05-19

Mia Jorgenson is a talented, self-employed masseuse, working out of her coastal Oregon home. One day a paroled rapist (Donevan Raitt) is referred to her. From the beginning, the reader is aware of his intentions, so it's no major surprise when he starts stalking her and her clients and killing random women along the way in an attempt to build up his courage to combine \\"a little death with a big death\\" (rape and murder).<br />Though Mia's the main character in \\"Thrill Kill,\\" I felt that Donevan was the more leading character here, even though he is the bad guy. I found him much more interesting than Mia, who didn't seem to have much of a life other being pretty and rubbing her troubled clients down. In fact, some of her clients seemed to have more depth to them than she did, such as Frannie Welch, the romance writer who happened to be Donevan's first rape victim back in high school.<br />The ending to \\"Thrill Kill\\" was ok (I really didn't have an opinion about it either way); but, overall, this is a good look into the obsessive mind of a rapist-turn-murderer. The front cover's a bit goofy with the Count Dracula-like face and ape-main arms, but it's still worth reading if you like psychological suspense/horror novels.<br />Consider yourself warned, though: There's quite a bit of sex and rape/violence in here. I found it a little odd that the rape scenes were much more graphic than the sex scenes, but, then again, this is horror, not romance.	2003-05-19

Plus it's been several years since I've read this book (sometime during my high school or middle school years), which adds to the confusion.<br />Anyway, the similarities between the two books are fairly obvious, in that the protagonist, 15-year-old Cassandra \\"Cassie\\" Winslow, loses her mother in a car crash in California and is consequently sent to live with her estranged father and his new family in False Harbor, Massachusetts, a setting that gives \\"The Unwanted\\" its somewhat Puritan/witch trial charm. It's here that a triangle of psychic power is reawakened between Cassie, Eric Cavanaugh (her 16-year-old neighbor), and Miranda Sikes (the local bag lady/witch who's been haunting her dreams lately). Soon Cassie becomes aware of powers she never knew she had--powers that are dangerous enough to kill. (\\"Carrie,\\" anyone?)<br />\\"The Unwanted\\" is certainly a must-read if you're a Saul fan and/or enjoy supernatural horror. This is one of many good books by him.	2003-05-16

Some of these &quot;teachings&quot; are as follows: &quot;Sleeping is very underrated&quot; (my favorite), &quot;Stare unabashedly&quot; (my cats have this one down to an art; it's almost eerie), &quot;Flaunt your hair loss&quot;, &quot;Make the world your playground&quot;, and &quot;Recognize the toy in everything&quot; (and they do).

In \\"The Plot Thickens,\\" each author was required to incorporate the following three things into their story: a thick fog, a thick steak, and a thick book. Most are concealed cleverly and seamlessly in the story, but I still found myself looking for them like it was a Where's Waldo? game. Not surprisingly, most of the authors use a restaurant setting to integrate the steak, but at least Westlake does a little play on of words in his story.<br />Anyway, on to the following 11 short stories:<br />\\"How Far It Could Go\\" by Lawrence Block is a largely conversational story set in a restaurant, where a woman meets with a man she intends on hiring to \\"rough up\\" her ex-boyfriend over a cash settlement. I kept expecting some great twist at the end (never happened); still, not a bad story. >> \\"Foolproof\\" by Edna Buchanan -- An Egyptian mummy autopsy reveals a 1000+ year-old murder victim with the same fingerprints as a notorious gang member. Again, the ending didn't impress me, and the story seemed to jump unevenly from scene to scene. >> \\"The Man Next Door\\" by Mary Higgins Clark -- A woman's creepy next-door neighbor breaks into her house through their shared basement wall (quite ingenious, in my opinion), in order for him to abduct her and keep her a prisoner in his home. Mary, being the brains behind this whole eradicate-American-illiterarcy thing (which this book donates a percentage to), not surprisingly has the longest \\"short\\" story in here, at approximately 40 pages, but it doesn't feel that long. It has an engrossing plot, and good characterization and alternating p.o.v. One of my faves in here.<br />\\"Too Many Cooks\\" by Carol Higgins Clark -- An aspiring actress is called in to play the role of a chef in a commercial, but accidents start occurring on the set. A little predictable about the bad guy, but still good. >> \\"Revenge & Rebellion\\" by Nelson & Lauren DeMille -- A woman meets with an old college friend who's now a literary agent, in the hopes he'll accept her manuscript. Another restaurant setting; in fact, two restaurants in this one. Good story, but the suspense twist doesn't happen until the last page. >> \\"The Last Peep\\" by Janet Evanovich -- A bounty hunter and her partner-in-training search for the missing body of a Peeping Tom. Strong, unique characters. Quite funny. >> \\"Going Under\\" by Linda Fairstein -- A policewoman agrees to go undercover as a dental patient in order to catch a molesting dentist. Reading this one made me glad I never chose to go under while at the dentist's--just to be safe.<br />\\"Thick-Headed\\" by Walter Mosley -- Two men find a dead body in the trunk of a car and get involved in solving the crime. A little confusing, probably because there were so many characters--dead and alive. >> \\"Love's Cottage\\" by Nancy Pickard was told in letter form and based on an actual mass murder in 1914. Short, good ending; however, since no motive was ever given in history, it's up to the reader to speculate on it. >> \\"The Road Trip\\" by Ann Rule -- A woman is harassed and followed by two guys in a semi-truck while on a road trip. Started out slow, but got better. >> \\"Take It Away\\" by Donald E. Westlake -- A police officer and his associates are on a stakeout in order to catch an overseas art smuggler. A great finale to this anthology. I got a laugh out of the ending.<br />In summary: \\"The Plot Thickens\\" is a pretty good mystery anthology. There are some dull stories, some entertaining ones--which can be said for most short story collections--but the majority are very good. Definitely worth reading if you're a fan of one or more of the authors in here.	2003-05-15

Here the woods are full of dangers, and the adults offer no real help or protection. So when, one by one, Billy's bunk mates start disappearing, he can only assume that he'll be next.<br />\\"Welcome to Camp Nightmare\\" is a fast-paced horror story, due in part to Stine's effective end-of-chapter cliffhangers. I was a little disappointed by the ending, though, but this is still a good book for 8 - 12-year-old Goosebumps fans. It's ideal summer camp reading, but only if you like to be scared.	2003-05-14

She's 16-year-old Marissa Bruner, who was born with a limp in one of her legs. One day, she notices an attractive guy who frequents her family-owned carousel park in Salmon Creek, Oregon. It's not just his good looks that draws Marissa's attention to him, but his habit of bringing a new girlfriend with him every time. Regardless of his casual dating style, Marissa can't stop thinking about him. But, in the meantime, one of her high school classmates goes missing, adding to a recently growing list of pretty young blondes who have mysteriously vanished from the area. Not surprisingly, all signs point to the mysterious stranger. The shared point of view between Marissa and the bad guy gives a little more suspense to this story. However, the bad guy's motive--which apparently resulted from an abusive childhood--was rather cliched and skin-deep (when does a bad guy not act out because of his troubled past?), leaving the reader still wondering \\"Why did he do what he did?\\" But at least Marissa's a stand-out character. She's resourceful and--though she's not fast on her feet--she's a quick thinker, using one of her life rules in a life-or-death situation: \\"If you can't outrun 'em, outsmart 'em.\\" Young adult readers who enjoy light suspense stories (no gratuitous blood and guts here)--as well as carousels--will probably like \\"Eyes of a Stranger.\\"	2003-05-13

Conner's been getting a little help from his mother's hidden scotch supply, though. That's an odd switch, considering his mother is a \\"recovering\\" alcoholic and he, apparently, is turning into one.<br />Liz Wakefield is still completely clueless about Tia and Conner's latest make-out session (in \\"Backstabber\\"), though, so she's still talking to both of them. In my opinion, she's forgiven them way too easily.<br />The three J's--Jade, Jeremy, and Jessica--are spotlighted a little more in this book, with Jeremy Aames going out with Jade Wu (She gets a navel piercing on their date. Surprisingly, I got a little queasy reading it, even though I've pierced that area myself.), which makes Jessica Wakefield more jealous. So, in turn, Jess tries to make him jealous by flirting with random guys, with some success.<br />\\"As If I Care\\" is an ok addition to this series, primarily revolving around the Jade/Jeremy/Jess love triangle. Nobody knows about Andy Marsden being gay yet (well, that changes, though, in the last few pages. To be continued in \\"It's My Life\\", I guess.), but at least he's looking into support groups. There are also some good notes, journal entries, instant messages, e-mails, as well as a suitable, if depressing, haiku by Conner on page 139.	2003-05-13

Marion considers this one horror, but I don't. It's not very scary, just confusing. >> \\"Isabelle and the Siren\\" by Mary Catelli -- A woman with acute depression avoids the fatal song of a siren, though the townsfolk aren't as lucky. People with depression can probably relate to this one. >> \\"Dragon's Tear\\" by Sonya Fedotowsky -- An elf and her three companions travel to a dragon's cave in search of a jewel that will save her island. A good one. >> \\"A Sister's Blood\\" by Patricia B. Cirone -- Confined in a dungeon, two sisters--one a swordswoman, the other a sorceress--try to find a way out of their prison cell. >> \\"Changed\\" by Lisa Deason -- A woman visits a magician, known as the Collector, who shapeshifts her--as well as others--into half-human/half-animal creatures, then keeps them as caged circus freaks. Vaguely reminded me of Peter S. Beagle's \\"The Last Unicorn\\". >> A ruthless king demands a sorceress to help him attain \\"The Power to Change the Shape of the Land\\" in Dayle A. Dermatis' story. The ending was a bit unfinished. Not bad though. >> \\"The Frog Prince\\" by Linda J. Dunn -- A princess is forced to kiss frog after frog in a king's attempt to find his shapeshifting son. A unique twist on the same-named fable. >> \\"Honey From the Rock\\" by Dorothy J. Heydt -- A sorceress tries to heal a dying Greek goddess, Artemis.<br />\\"The Will of the Wind\\" by Christina Krueger -- A teacher ignores the regulations and traditions of her school in order to initiate one of her talented students into the Priesthood. Bittersweet ending. >> A martial arts student is asked to judge akata contest in Carol E. Leever's \\"Moonlight on Water\\". Cat & martial arts lovers should like this one. >> \\"Nine Springs\\" by Kathleen M. Massie-Ferch -- A warrior searches for a sacred spring that will heal her dying friend. Another good one. >> This poetic story deals with the reincarnation of a \\"Mistweaver\\" (by Terry McGarry). >> \\"Waking the Stone Maiden\\" by Cynthia McQuillin -- A young woman searches for the Stone Maiden. Another good one. >> \\"City of No-Sleep\\" by Vera Nazarian -- A city is transformed every night when the king falls asleep. Imaginative setting. >> \\"Daughter of the Bear\\" by Diana Paxson -- When a woman is blamed for killing a man, she calls on a Viking bear god to prove her innocence. >> \\"The Wishing Stones\\" by Lisa S. Silverthorne -- A captured sorceress plots her freedom through three little wishing stones. Nice & short. >> \\"A Fool's Game\\" by Selina Rosen -- A woman seeks the teachings of a legendary swordswoman. Good lesson on life in general.<br />\\"The Anvil of Her Pride\\" by Lawrence Schimel -- A swordsmith's profession proves to be the demise of the man she loves. >> \\"The Dancing Men of Ballyben\\" by Laura J. Underwood -- A mageborn woman attempts to rescue a young man who's been transformed into stone during the day. >> \\"Salt & Sorcery\\" by Elisabeth Waters & Michael Spence differs from the others, in that it's more of a present-day story set on a college campus. Some spellwork/magic. >> \\"Weaving Spells\\" by Lawrence Watt-Evans -- A woman searches for her missing fiancee in a wizard's castle. >> \\"Enaree: An Azkhantian Tale\\" by Deborah Wheeler -- A woman tires to break her traditional role in this desert setting. >> \\"The Day They Ran Out of Princesses\\" by Gail Sosinsky Wickman -- A servant is ennobled as a princess in order to sacrifice her to a tyrannical winged slug. (laughing) Yes, a flying slug. :) Glad we don't have those in the Northwest. >> \\"Taking Flight\\" by Susan Wolven -- A woman's sister's hawk returns with a message for her. >> Katherine L. Rogers' \\"The Vision That Appeared\\" I had to read twice, even though it was, like, 2 pages. It's about a woman who attempts an old family spell. Not a terrific ending to this book, but it'll do.<br />As with most short story anthologies, this collection has a mixture of excellent stories, mediocre ones, and ones that are easily forgotten by the next page. But what probably bugged me the most in this book was how Marion had to give her two cents in every author bio. Still, fans of fantasy should like this series, not just feminists/women readers, though it tends to attract a female audience.	2003-05-08

In this sixth and final installment in The Green Mile serialization, the true identity of the twins' killer is revealed (though I won't give that away, because it's a shocker). Plus, the killer and Percy Wetmore (the evil prison guard), at last(!), get what they deserve. And as for John Coffey: well, that was just a tear-jerker. I won't give away what happens to him either. You just have to read the series--or just this book, if you want to skip the rest.<br />In the afterword, King points out some of his anachronisms in the series, like whether or not certain radio programs were broadcast in 1932. These \\"mistakes\\" were still left in the serial novel, as far as I can tell, even though King had considered removing them. But what was removed was this afterword, as well as the foreword in book #1 (\\"The Two Dead Girls\\"); so there were a few things altered by the end.	2003-05-07

Together they share their troubles with men (i.e., Emma is emotionally involved with a married man), careers/jobs, family (two of the women are trying for children, with no luck), and just life-in-general problems.<br />At times, I got a few of the characters mixed up and had to write their names down to keep them straight, like so: Emma DeWitt, the sarcastic journalist who wants to be a novelist; Rudy Surratt-Lloyd, the dysfunctional pillhead; Lee Pavlik-Patterson, the sensible one; and Isabel Thorlefsen-Kurtz, the &quot;mother&quot; of the group. Isabel stood out the most for me, mainly because she was kind of the matriarch of the group. Plus, she had the most life-altering issues with cancer and an unfaithful husband (though Rudy's, by far, is worse). But out of all of them, I could relate to Emma the most, probably because of her sarcasm.<br />I bought &quot;The Saving Graces&quot; mainly because the front cover and synopsis reminded me a little of Judy Blume's &quot;Summer Sisters&quot; (another book I'd recommend). I especially liked how the chapters alternated between each woman's first person point of view, which gave great depth to this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it anyone interested in contemporary novels about sisterhood/friendship.	2003-05-07

Jade also seems to bringing the unruly side of him out, which may or may not be a good thing, especially when she almost gets him in trouble at work.<br />Most of the emphasis in \\"Backstabber\\" is on Conner, Tia, and Elizabeth. That's all well and good (though I'm disliking Conner more and more with each new book), but what happened to another big issue at hand: Andy Marsden's being gay, which was revealed in the previous book? That didn't go into depth at all here, just a couple journal entries by him. I'm still surprised that such a topic would be brought up in a Sweet Valley book, but it's a storyline I really look forward to watching unfold, especially since Andy's one of my favorite characters.	2003-05-02

Not only that, but parts of the movie are going to be filmed just outside of Karen's house. But Karen wants to be more than just an extra. She wants to be a movie star and Allison's friend. Can she be both?<br />I usually like the black-and-white illustrations in all of the BSLS books, which are drawn by Susan Tang, but the ones in \\"Karen's Movie Star\\" are rather sloppy compared to the earlier drawings in this series. But, overall, this was a pretty good BSLS book, even though there is some really sad news about the family cat, Boo-Boo.	2003-04-30

While Christopher Pike has been popular among older teen readers for decades, he's expanded his books to a younger audience of readers (8 - 12 year olds), in his recent series called Spooksville, which has some similarities to R. L. Stine's Goosebumps and Fear Street books.<br />In this third book in the series, four friends (Adam, Watch, Sally, and Cindy) go into the Haunted Cave in search of man's evolutionary missing link--something that's part human, part ape. However, three of them get trapped inside the cave without a way out, stuck on an endless trail of bloodthirsty trolls and bats and impending death, while the remaining friend tries to find a way to rescue them.<br />I thought \\"The Haunted Cave\\" was more of an adventure story than a horror story--and definitely not as bloody or provocative as some of Pike's older teen books; so this book is appropriate for all ages, particularly preteens. Still, I prefer his other books.	2003-04-30

Like all gamebooks, \\"The Invaders of Hark\\" isn't meant to be read from beginning to end like a normal book, though you do start there for the rules and map, before you're forwarded on to another page and adventure.<br />I was never very good at these kind of books, so it took me numerous tries before I won (thankfully, it took me less than an hour to do so). But \\"The Invaders of Hark\\" is good for young sci-fi readers who like gamebooks, particularly more patient, intent readers, because it's easy to become aggravated by some of the--at times--senseless actions/reactions of the main character and his enemies.<br />Hint: Mark the choices you make with pencil, X-ing out dead ends, so it'll be easier to get to the end. This helped me out a little bit; however, I noticed that when I did do this, I stopped paying attention to the story--not that there's much of one--because I was more interested in winning than reading. I'm not sure if that's the point of the book or not. I didn't learn very much from it.	2003-04-30

From there, the reader travels back in time to the Ice Age, colonial America, the Dark Ages--even traveling ahead in time. There is no one ending or quest to this book, so you're not in a mad dash to win. In fact, there is no \\"winning\\" in here, just 40 possible endings to certain situations--some good, some fatal.

Unfortunately, it's at the hand of Percy Wetmore, the prison guard who's been bullying Eduard from the beginning. He's the one who sabotages the execution, giving Eduard a painfully long-drawn-out death. This scene is rather gruesome and will remind readers that this is still Stephen King writing, even though The Green Mile isn't King's usual horror fare.<br />While Eduard dies, though, Mr. Jingles is \\"resurrected\\" by John Coffey, after Percy had stepped on him in the previous book, \\"Coffey's Hands.\\" Like the sudden endings in most of these books, this one has another good cliffhanger, in regards to Coffey's innocence. These sudden endings can be aggravating, but they were a very good marketing technique at the time of publishing--to keep the loyal reader addicted for the next installment, especially for the following two: \\"Night Journey\\" (#5) and \\"Coffey on the Mile\\" (#6). However, since the complete serial novel has since been published, I'd recommend getting that one instead.	2003-04-28

Yet it's not this tragedy that is the focal point of the book--it's John's otherworldly ability to cure people with his hands (like he does with Paul's urinary infection and Melinda Moores' inoperable brain tumor), as well as animals, like Mr. Jingles (Eduard's talented pet mouse), who is severely injured by a cruel prison guard, Percy Wetmore--the one character most readers will wholeheartedly agree should have been on the other side of the bars on E Block.<br />\\"The Green Mile\\" had initially been published back in '96 in chapbook form, one book coming out per month. (This was also seen with John Saul's The Blackstone Chronicles around the same time, a serialization I also liked.) This novel contains all six parts (#1: \\"The Two Dead Girls\\", #2: \\"The Mouse on the Mile\\", #3: \\"Coffey's Hands\\", #4: \\"The Bad Death of Eduard Delacroix\\", #5: \\"Night Journey\\", and #6: \\"Coffey on the Mile\\"), word-for-word, as far as I can tell, except for the foreword letter that appeared in the first chapbook, and the afterword in the last chapbook. Putting all six parts together, \\"The Green Mile\\" equals more than 500 pages, which is really nothing considering King can crank a book out twice that size. But what I'm getting at is that it's cheaper--and more convenient--to buy The Green Mile in this novel version than the individual chapbooks.<br />A few years later, the book was made into a movie, which I actually saw before reading the book.Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan's performances really stuck in my head while I was reading the book, and I'm not quite sure which I enjoyed more--the movie or the book.<br />\\"The Green Mile\\" isn't King's usual horror fare (though the \\"bad death\\" of Eduard Delacroix will appease those gore-hungry fans), but that could be said about a lot of his more recent \\"literary\\" novels. So, readers who are more comfortable with his current books should probably enjoy \\"The Green Mile\\" a little more than, say, people who are used to his \\"Carrie\\" or \\"Cujo\\" books. Still, it's undisputed that King is a master storyteller, which is obvious by this book.	2003-04-28

The mouse (Steamboat Willy, later known as Mr. Jingles) is spotlighted a little more, as well the electrocution of one of the inmates, known as The Chief. I didn't mind either topics, but I was more interested in John Coffey's story, since it had just started to unravel in the first book, \\"The Two Dead Girls\\", then was all but skipped in this one. Great cliffhanger at the end, though, which will make readers eager to read the next book and the next--\\"Coffey's Hands\\" (#3), \\"The Bad Death of Eduard Delacroix\\" (#4), \\"Night Journey\\" (#5), and \\"Coffey on the Mile\\" (#6).	2003-04-26

In this first chapter, Paul Edgecombe is shown in his current retirement home, before the book picks up where part two left off--with William \\"Wild Bill\\" Wharton arriving at Cold Mountain Penitentiary and nearly killing one of the guards. He certainly lives up to his wild name in this book.<br />Then the reader learns of John Coffey's healing gift, which he uses on Paul to cure his urinary infection. Paul later does a little investigation into John's past, though nothing new is revealed.<br />This book has a great cliffhanger, just like the previous book, though this one is a little sad. If you enjoyed \\"Coffey's Hands,\\" then you'll want to start with the first two--\\"The Two Dead Girls\\" (#1) and \\"The Mouse on the Mile\\" (#2)--and continue with the remaining three: \\"The Bad Death of Eduard Delacroix\\" (#4), \\"Night Journey\\" (#5), and \\"Coffey on the Mile\\" (#6).

However, unbeknown to Lila, Mr. Fowler plans on having the party anyway, as a way to teach her a lesson. Everybody knows about the surprise party, except for Lila.<br />Meanwhile, Mrs. Otis, their second grade teacher, intends on dying her hair bright red as a way to teach Lila, Ellen Riteman, and Jessica Wakefield a lesson about looks not being important (particularly about hair), after Mrs. Otis caught the three girls teasing Amy Sutton at the beginning of \\"Lila's April Fool.\\"<br />As shown, Lila is twice the butt of everyone's April Fools' joke. While it's nice to see her a little humbled, since she's a mean snob, I thought it was a little much. Plus the whole party secret was a bit too complicated.

Needless to say, their first issue doesn't go over well. So they decide on a new approach, by learning from grocery store tabloids--only nobody takes it seriously.

Summarized: one of King's friends recommended this style of writing to him; and since he enjoyed reading such serializations growing up, King decided to have a go at it himself--and, not surprisingly, it turned out great.<br />In this first part, the main characters are introduced: Old Sparky, the electric chair; Paul Edgecombe, the storyteller and superintendent of the E Block at Cold Mountain Penitentiary, where this book takes place, in 1932; the much-hated guard, Percy Wetmore; the other inmate, Eduard Delacroix, and his talented pet mouse, Mr. Jingles; and, of course, John Coffey, an enormous, yet simpleminded, black man sentenced to death for the rape-murder of nine-year-old twins, Cora and Kathe Detterick.<br />As a chapbook thriller should, \\"The Two Dead Girls\\" ends with the reader wanting to know more.

In this book, 17-year-old Ruby Landry/Dumas is sent to an all girls private boarding school (Greenwood) in Baton Rouge with her recently crippled twin sister, Gisselle Dumas. As usual, Ruby is mistreated by authority figures, such as the headmistress, Mrs. Ironwood, who's in cahoots with Ruby's mean-spirited stepmother, Daphne. Ruby is also regarded as her sister's keeper and punished for the things Gisselle does. While Gisselle is the spoiled, mean twin, I liked her at times more than Ruby in this book. She was outspoken and funny for the most part, though she oftentimes went overboard to get attention, like how she humiliates one of Ruby's biracial friends at a dance.<br />Ruby, once again, isn't short for romance in this book, even while at an all girls school. She meets a 30-year-old blind pianist (Louis Turbull), who is the grandson of one of the school's matriarchs. And on the side is Gisselle's ex/Ruby's current boyfriend, Beau Andreas, with martyr-like Paul Tate lurking somewhere in the background until later in this book/series.<br />Though Ruby has her peaks at Greenwood--meeting Louis, perfecting her painting, and making friends with a quadroon, Abby Tyler--she is devastated when her father dies of a heart attack, leaving her and Gisselle in the bitter hands of their stepmother. This little drama continues in the next book, &quot;All That Glitters,&quot; and wraps up in the final two: &quot;Hidden Jewel&quot; and &quot;Tarnished Gold.&quot; While the Landry series isn't my favorite, it's still one of the ghostwriter's (Andrew Niederman) better series and worth reading if you're a V. C. Andrews fan.	2003-04-22

It takes place in England, where a lot of these stories occur. This one is about a young woman who raises a litter of unknown animals (a mix between cats and dogs), only to have them grow bigger and seek human victims. By the synopsis on the back cover, I thought this book was about creatures like this; but the other five short stories involve everything from possessed pianos (\\"The Piano\\" by Diane Hoh) to houses (\\"The House That Jack Built\\" by Garry Kilworth) to train stations (\\"The Station With No Name\\" by Colin Greenland), as well as other beings like the Devil (\\"The Devil's Footprints\\" by Malcolm Rose) and a group of vengeful toys (\\"Softies\\" by Stan Nicholls).<br />With just six short stories, you would think this book would be a breeze to finish, but a lot of the stories were rather long-winded and boring, averaging some 30-odd pages each. And some of the endings were incomplete, flat-out silly even. But for young horror fans who like stories where the bad guys wins overall, then \\"The Cat-Dogs\\" is worth checking out.	2003-04-22

While &quot;The Ransom&quot; is supposed to be about Randall's kidnapping, that doesn't occur until about halfway into the book. The beginning half mainly has to do with the Kershaw's thieving servants and a gold digger named Mrs. J. Rivington Romayne who is all but climbing over Christobel's dead stepmother's body to become the next Mrs. Kershaw. I actually liked this beginning half, even though some readers may find it pointless to the overall plot.<br />It wasn't until around the midpoint that I began having difficulty finishing the book. For starters, the dialogue was slowing me down because of some of the character's accents, like this Scottish one: &quot;This world's gangin' all aglae!&quot; Then there were the occasions where the author wanted to preach at the reader instead of being a storyteller, which is her obvious intention by reading her bio--of being a &quot;messenger&quot; over a writer. So I'd just skim over these parts and move on to the bigger story.<br />While Livingston-Hill is a well-known Christian romance writer, there is no romance in this book. Yet I would hardly call it a suspense novel either. But readers who like wholesome, well-written stories that are somewhat akin to L. M. Montgomery, then I'd recommend this book.	2003-04-21

While it's not about murder per se, \\"Stuck in Neutral\\" is still a little disturbing--about a young boy with C.P. (cerebral palsy) who fears his estranged father wants to \\"end his pain\\" by euthanizing him. The book was based on Trueman's own experience as a parent to a child like Shawn, which gives the story a more realistic touch, and the reader can't help but wonder if Shawn's father and Terry Trueman share the same opinions about C.P. and euthanasia.<br />While, overall, the book was great--it's a bit of a tear-jerker, but funny and honest as well (some profanity)--I was pretty disappointed by the inconclusive ending. Still, it was a quick read (114 pages), and I was able to read it in one sitting, so I had to give it a \\"5.\\" Definitely worth reading if you're interested in C.P. or euthanasia.	2003-04-21

I don't play role-playing games--I even have an aversion to games in general (mostly video ones)--but I really love vampires, so I had to buy this book. Probably the thing I like the most about it is all of the beautiful black-and-white drawings inside. They really get the imagination juices flowing.<br />The beginning part of the book is basically an introduction to VtM, familiarizing the reader with the basic rules, its Gothic-Punk setting, vocabulary, and tips on effective storytelling. Then it goes deeper into dice rolling, character creation, and bloodlines. This latter part is my favorite in the book, describing the attributes and abilities of the seven clans of the Camarilla: Brujah, Nosferatu, Tremere, Ventrue, Gangrel, Toreador, and Malkavian. (But if you really want further insight into these clans, then I'd highly recommend any--or all--of the Clanbooks.) There is also a character sheet at the end of the book you can Xerox, as well as an example story to further help players.<br />I think I've read this thing about half a dozen times (though not usually from front to back), and it takes about that many times to thoroughly comprehend and memorize all of the above--rules, guidelines, etc.--without having to refer to the book all the time (unless you're a fast learner). If you enjoy role-playing games--or if you're like me and just like anything vampire-oriented--then I highly recommend this book. It's well worth your time and money.	2003-04-15

But Byron fans should like this one since he's cast as the main character--as a vampire, of all things--narrating his past to his single captive audience, Rebecca Carville. His existence in \\"Lord of the Dead\\" basically consists of him traveling all over Europe, which does become monotonous after awhile. Yet it's in Greece, where he's traveling with his companion Hobhouse, that he is unwillingly turned into a vampire by Vakhel Pasha. Byron also happens to be in love with the Pasha's young runaway slave, Haidee, which is part of the reason why he kills the Pasha and then escapes the rabid village with her--only to face tragedy a short time later.<br />The book started out ok, so I was a little confused by all of the low reviews; however, as I continued reading, I understood why. After the first couple chapters, the book seems to fizzle out, especially after Byron kills the Pasha for the first time (yes, he has to attempt this more than once; I guess some people don't understand the meaning of \\"immortality.\\") Then comes Byron's internal struggle with his new existence--as well as his acquaintance with other fellow vampires--which doesn't really add anything new to the vampire myth. I wondered exactly how Rebecca could sit there and listen for all 341 pages and not become bored herself. About 100 pages could have been removed from \\"Lord of the Dead\\" and it wouldn't have harmed the story a bit; in fact, it would have probably improved it.<br />And like a few reviewers before me, I did notice some similarities between Anne Rice's \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" (because of how the book's told in story form) and Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" (when Byron is brought to Vakhel Pasha's dark, mountainous castle). And like in most vampire novels, there's blood-drinking and casual sex (as expected with the notorious Byron) in this one as well, though it's relatively reserved for the most part, except for a few scenes that involve things like meat hooks, homosexuality, and incest--but none of them were very erotic or exciting, in my opinion. In summary: This isn't a book I'd necessarily recommend, unless you're a really big fan of Lord Byron and vampires.with the notorious Byron) in this one as well, though it's relatively reserved for the most part, except for a few scenes that involve things like meat hooks, homosexuality, and incest--but none of them were very erotic or exciting, in my opinion.

1163485:US	50720905	R7RCIWG82MYG	0590452568	594437753	Thirteen: 13 Tales of Horror by 13 Masters of Horror	Books	4	6	6	N	N	"13 Tales of Horror by 13 Masters of Horror"	Well, technically, there are 14 short stories, since Christopher Pike's contains two parts, set at the beginning and end of \\"Thirteen.\\" The first part (\\"Collect Call I\\") is about two girls who drive home after a party, except they get into an accident and one of them dies. Then the remaining girl starts receiving messages on her answering machine from the dead girl. The second part (\\"Collect Call II: The Black Walker\\") begins some time after the fatal accident, when the remaining girl starts dating the mysterious Bobby Walker--only to be reunited with the other dead girl. Now, I'm a big Christopher Pike fan, but I didn't think this two-part short story was his best work; in fact, these two stories are somewhat weaker compared to some of the other 12 stories shown below (if you'd rather not know what they're about, just skip the following three paragraphs and read the last paragraph--don't worry; I didn't give away the endings):<br />\\"Lucinda\\" by Lael Littke -- A 16-year-old girl and her older brother return to their hometown to investigate the six-year-old death of his girlfriend. As explained in Littke's bio at the end of this book, the location for this story was based on real events--of \\"a real town that was moved when the nearby river was damned and the valley flooded.\\" I really liked the original setting; it gives the whole story a remote, ghost town quality--and even an Atlantis feel when the town had been under water. >> \\"The Guiccioli Miniature\\" by Jay Bennett -- Set in Venice, Italy, a young college student is approached by a poor painter to buy one of his copies of the Guiccioli miniature. This 8-paged story is not your typical horror fare; it kind of sticks out because of its more \\"intelligent\\" horror and open ending. >> \\"Blood Kiss\\" by D.E. Athkins -- Elizabeth and her two girl friends fall for the new boy who everybody thinks is a vampire. This story has a lighter, more humorous mood than the rest. >> \\"A Little Taste of Death\\" by Patricia Windsor -- A 15-year-old girl reads an eerie ad in the newspaper that requests she contact someone about a 10-year-old event. This one was okay, but leaves a few questions unanswered. Restates the obvious: Never take candy from a stranger.<br />\\"The Doll\\" by Carol Ellis -- After moving in to her family's new home, 16-year-old Abby finds a doll in the attic that tries to harm Abby's friends and family. >> \\"House of Horrors\\" by J.B. Stamper -- While working as a guide at the House of Horrors, Mark is invited to an after-hours party in the wax museum. This was another good one; it vaguely reminded me of the movie \\"Waxworks,\\" though it was based on Stamper's experience at a famous wax museum in London. Readers will certainly be able to relate to Mark's claustrophobia. >> \\"Where the Deer Are\\" by Caroline B. Cooney -- Walking to school one day with her four friends, Tiffany has a premonition that Nature (which consists of the nearby deer, woods, and cliff known as Dead Kid Curve) has decided to claim one of them after 25 years. But who will it be? This one has a Nature vs. Human theme, and reminded me a little of Cooney's Losing Christina trilogy, with the paranoia, isolation, and her darker, more spare writing. Definitely one of the weirder ones. >> \\"The Spell\\" by R.L. Stine -- A young girl's boyfriend gets interested in hypnotism and uses his new talent to get even with his friends who had teased him about it. I'm not a big Stine fan, but this one was good. The ending--though left open--was effectively scary.<br />\\"Dedicated to the One I Love\\" by Diane Hoh -- One by one, three friends hear a radio dedication to them, made by their two-timing (or, in this case, three-timeing) ex-boyfriend Richie--and one by one, each girl has a tragic accident. This one gets better as you read; there's a twist halfway through it. >> \\"Hacker\\" by Sinclair Smith -- A young student becomes a serial killer's next victim when she starts receiving messages from him on her class computer. This one was ratherdisappointing because of how easy it is to guess the killer; there aren't very many characters in it. >> \\"Deathflash\\" by A. Bates -- As mentioned in Bates' bio, this one is about good vs. evil--about a young girl who fears a soul-consuming creature is after her. >> \\"The Boy Next Door\\" by Ellen Emerson White -- A young girl working in an ice cream parlor (during winter, of all times) is robbed and threatened by one of her childhood friends. This is another favorite of mine; it's very suspenseful and has a great ending.<br />As shown above, the majority of stories in \\"Thirteen\\" involve ghosts, the supernatural, curses and superstitions, vampires, murderous dolls, scary wax museums, hypnotism, and--what horror anthology wouldn't be complete without--serial killers. Some of these stories are bloody, but even notorious gore writers like R.L. Stine are able to tame it a bit. Whether or not that's a good thing depends on your taste of horror, I guess. But no matter what your level of horror is, \\"Thirteen\\" is definitely worth owning, especially if you're a fan of one or more of the authors in this book.	2003-04-10

Tony works at Foxfire Stables, where Darcy hopes her good friend, Molly Mason, will learn to ride her horse again in their riding program for the disabled. (Molly's a paraplegic.) However, shortly after Molly boards her horse there, strange things start happening--like theft, arson, and poisoning--and soon the staff at Foxfire Stables are under suspicion, specifically Tony.<br />It's rather obvious who the bad guy is; in fact, the reader will probably be able to guess him/her about halfway into the book. And as for motive, there isn't one. A couple other reasons why I gave this book a \\"4\\" instead of a \\"5\\" was because I was a little disappointed about the telepathic scenes--or lack of them. Darcy apparently has ESP; however, the only telepathy I was aware of were her nightmares, and anyone can have those.<br />Also, the romance was a bit corny and unbelievable. I didn't feel any major spark between the couples, even though the author repeatedly stated they were crazy about each other. But \\"Sunset After Midnight\\" was a quick read (I read it in one day), so I had to give it at least a \\"4\\". Fans of teen romantic suspense and of the Sunset Island books should probably like this spin-off series, even though Cherie Bennett doesn't do the writing herself--a ghostwriter (Jessica Lynn) does.	2003-04-09
1168360:US	50720905	R1DRU7S1XH5YMZ	014038958X	624308742	Pictures in the Dark (Puffin Novel)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	"Something Terrifying is Coming into Focus...."	The photogenic front cover of \\"Pictures in the Dark\\" was what caught my eye and made me buy the book. The story is just as good, about a young English boy named Charlie Willcox who befriends two misfit siblings at his school: Jennifer and Peter Luttrell. Of the two, Peter is the most bullied, not only at school (Charlie's cousin, Zoe, is among the bullies), but at home as well. The main reason why the kids harass him so much is because they believe he has supernatural powers, that he can harm other people just by giving them the \\"Evil Eye.\\" This barrage of abuse inflicted on Peter from all sides made the book a bit depressing and dark, and I will have to say, the ending didn't exactly satisfy me in regard to Peter.<br />It's difficult to label this book, because it's not exactly horror, suspense, or fantasy, even though the tagline on the front cover (\\"Something terrifying is coming into focus....\\") leads the reader to believe otherwise. It does almost have a vampire quality to it at times, i.e., when Peter bites Charlie, then Charlie seems to change; but I guess that was more of the animal behavior coming out in Peter than any supernatural means.<br />\\"Pictures in the Dark\\" might be a little too complex for younger readers, particularly the ending, so I'd probably recommend this book to more advanced teen readers. Some of the British vocabulary may be a bit troublesome, too, such as conker (horse chestnut) and torch (flashlight), just to name a few. But, overall, I thought \\"Pictures in the Dark\\" was well written, brisk, and vivid--though slightly strange. This book is certainly worth reading if you're into photography, since the protagonist (Charlie) is very much into this hobby and uses it skillfully throughout the book to relate to Peter and the otter both boys share a unique bond with.	2003-04-06

But before Pat even starts, she receives several threatening phone calls--and, later, a note--telling her not to pursue the program, and to definitely not reside in the same house she had lived in the first three years of her life. This last half of the threat is alarming to her, because very few people know about her parent's murder-suicide in that house, which is part of the reason why she had decided to stay there--so she could find out the truth about their death in private.<br />When she's not searching for clues about that, Pat is delving into Senator Jennings' background, though the woman is reluctant to open up about certain parts of her life, forcing Pat to investigate further. She eventually does get into trouble for that when she reveals too much about the senator's past--involving theft, infidelity, and murder.<br />\\"Stillwatch\\" is fairly fast-paced and an all-around good read. While partially a political mystery, it's relatively uncomplicated and free of political jargon, so the average reader can understand it. There's also a small amount of romance involving Pat and Sam Kingsley, an older congressman she had had a brief affair with a couple of years ago, but who has now become somewhat involved with the senator. I'm not much of a romance fan, but this underlying storyline was tolerable and doesn't overshadow the main story; plus I admired how Pat acted in the relationship; she wasn't the typical clingy, overly-sentimental heroine. If this book is any indication of what her others are like, then this certainly won't be my last Mary Higgins Clark book.	2003-04-05

As with every SVHSY book, the ending is just crammed with lots of drama, making you eager to read the next one as soon as possible. And \\"Three Girls...\\" certainly delivers, shock-wise. But I won't spoil the ending for you. Instead, here are the three main story lines in \\"Three Girls...\\":<br />1) Conner McDermott and Elizabeth Wakefield haven't been spending too much time together lately due to Liz's hectic schedule. There's that tension--as well as Conner's mother returning from rehab--that has him a nervous wreck. So he turns to the only person he feels he can talk to about this: Tia Ramirez. However, Liz thinks something's going on between these two, which is perceptive of her, because Tia's recent feelings for Conner have been anything but platonic, as you'll see by the end.<br />2) Ken Matthews gets more acquainted with his father's girlfriend, particularly since his dad doesn't have enough time even for her. This story line wasn't too interesting, though the ending was a little more so.<br />3) Andy Marsden's not too sure if he's cut out for a relationship with Six Hanson--or any relationship for that matter. The ending to this little dilemma will certainly have readers surprised, though I kind of suspected something a few books back. What I am surprised about is that such a topic would even be brought up in a Sweet Valley book. This is definitely not the same SV books I grew up on, which is a relief, in that this series is much more realistic.<br />Overall, \\"Three Girls and a Guy\\" is a great addition to the SVHSY series, with several good surprises at the end. Can't wait to read the next one: \\"Backstabber.\\"	2003-04-02

Most everyone in the agitated town believes a satanic cult is responsible for their deaths, so FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are called in to investigate. Yet three more teens die anyway--and all signs point to two 17-year-old cheerleaders, Terri Roberts and Margi Kleinjan, whose fates are culminating during a syzygy (an alignment of three celestial objects).<br />This book/episode has some rather funny parts, particularly regarding Mulder and Scully's out-of-character behavior--Scully acts more skeptical and moody than usual, and Mulder falls for the attractive town detective, Angela White. \\"Syzygy\\" is one of my favorite X-Files episodes, and Easton Royce (a pen name used by Neal Shusterman; his collaborator: Eric Elfman) does an excellent novelization of it. It's like \\"Carrie,\\" times two, with a cosmic twist.	2003-04-02

While \\"Second Child\\" begins with Teri, it's her half sister (Melissa Holloway) that's more of the protagonist--or at least the one the reader feels the most sympathy for. Both girls have their own secrets--Teri's being she's a killer, and Melissa's being she has an imaginary friend (D'Arcy) that's actually a ghost who resides in the attic, inhabiting Melissa's body whenever her abusive mother punishes her, which is quite often. Once Teri discovers this secret, she uses Melissa's weak mental health to her advantage, hoping to knock her out of the picture so she can have the kind of life she thinks she deserves, in Melissa's place.<br />I read \\"Second Child\\" either in middle or high school (I don't remember which), so it's appropriate for readers that young, since they can probably relate easier to the teen characters in this book. Like most of Saul's books, \\"Second Child\\" has a supernatural twist to it, linking D'Arcy to events that happened 100 years ago in Secret Cove. Horror fans should definitely like this one.	2003-03-30

This is also one of the few books where the reader is aware of the time period in which the book takes place--the early 1960s.<br />As is typical with every V. C. Andrews heroine, Ruby has tremendous artistic talent and is encouraged by her grandmother to pursue her dreams of becoming a successful painter. However, several life-altering secrets arise to detour her from doing so. For starters, Ruby finds out her boyfriend (Paul Tate) is really her half-brother. (Imagine that.) Yet that doesn't really bother either of them, because they still get hot and heavy. Forbidden fruit and all that, I guess.<br />Ruby's second surprise comes when she finds a photo of her father, Pierre Dumas, and discovers that she has a twin sister living with him somewhere in New Orleans. Shortly after Grandmere Catherine confesses all of this, she dies, leaving Ruby in the care of her despicable, alcoholic Grandpere Jack, which was an obvious mistake, because he tries to sell her just like he did with her other two illegitimate siblings. So, Ruby flees Houma and searches for her wealthy family in New Orleans during Mardi Gras, a terrifically authentic setting that horror writer Anne Rice uses quite often in her own books; and it works just fine for V. C. Andrews as well in this series.<br />It's always interesting when I shop for V. C. Andrews books, because either her books are tucked away in the romance section, or they're mislabeled as horror. I've even found them in the kids section, but those are usually the recent miniseries books. While \\"Flowers in the Attic,\\" for one, could probably be considered horror, most of her books are just dramatic family sagas, aka general fiction. There's nothing remotely scary about these books. It's more psychological, involving lurid family secrets (like rape and incest, which are hardly romance-friendly topics); that's probably why these books are branded \\"gothic horror.\\"<br />Anyway, \\"Ruby\\" pretty much follows the same paint-by-numbers storyline that has been haunting practically every latter-day series by V. C. Andrews. Yet this is still a captivating series, filled with Cajun-style superstitions and horrible family secrets. Following \\"Ruby\\" comes \\"Pearl in the Mist\\" (#2), \\"All That Glitters\\" (#3), \\"Hidden Jewel\\" (#4), and \\"Tarnished Gold\\" (#5).	2003-03-28

Andrews fan, then this trivia and quiz book is certainly a must-have. It contains a lot of information, though it only covers from &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; to &quot;Midnight Whispers&quot; (a brief summary of &quot;Darkest Hour&quot; is given though)--which is fine by me, because I thought her earliest books were her best anyway.<br />Most of &quot;The V. C. Andrews Trivia and Quiz Book&quot; is devoted to analyzing the fifteen novels with plot summaries, quizzes, and random facts for each one. There's an adequate two-page biography of V. C. Andrews, as well as a &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; interview of her near the end, and a crossword puzzle (I have yet to even attempt it).<br />The last part of the book is devoted to the &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; movie, giving a scene-by-scene description, as well as an interview with Kristy Swanson, who played Cathy Dollanganger. While this section is entertaining, it seemed that Spignesi wanted to somehow work Swanson in to the book, because the interview begins to detour from &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; and V. C. Andrews after awhile; plus he includes part of her filmography and other odd info. I did enjoy Wes Craven's attempt at writing a script for the movie, though; it would have certainly been interesting if he had had his way with it.<br />While the book as a whole is very good, there were some rather pointless and unnecessary facts thrown in, like a list of common chapter titles (wow, someone had way too much time on his hands), and the whole &quot;Leafing Through...&quot; section was pretty much worthless; it just describes mundane things, like &quot;4 of the Different Types of Clocks in Whitefern&quot; and &quot;10 Nasty Names Cindy Called Bart&quot; (these are just two of many useless lists). But, overall, this is a terrific book. Spignesi really did his homework. Highly recommended, as well as &quot;V. C. Andrews: A Critical Companion&quot; by E. D. Huntley and/or &quot;Faces of Fear&quot; by Douglas E. Winter.	2003-03-28

Here Tanaquil collects fossils that she finds in the sand. Then one day she discovers the skeleton of a unicorn, and by putting the pieces together, the unicorn somehow comes back to life, leading her and her pet peeve (yes, it's actually called a peeve--a small, catlike creature that's somewhat akin to the beasts in \\"Biting the Sun\\") on one adventure after another, ultimately reuniting her with her unknown father and sister in a faraway city.<br />The title is somewhat misleading, in that \\"Black Unicorn\\" isn't predominantly about unicorns, but more of a young woman's quest. I really loved Tanaquil's little \\"sidekick,\\" the peeve, who creates a lighthearted touch to the story, almost stealing every scene with its high-strung antics and broken English. This is an appropriate book for all ages, though ideal for young girls interested in fantasies/adventures. Plus it's short (188 pages) and easy to read. If you liked this one, then you'll probably like the following two in this series: \\"Gold Unicorn\\" and \\"Red Unicorn.\\"	2003-03-28

The spirals are practical, making it easy to use; plus the book's small enough to store just about anywhere near your computer. The primary purpose of this book is &quot;to help transcription and others produce correctly written and formatted documents,&quot; which it does do. It's also meant to be used in conjunction with &quot;Transcription Skills for Business&quot; by Linda Mallinson, Lois Meyer, and Ruth Moyer (which I also have). Yet, as this book mentions, it's not necessary to have both books, especially since this one is the more practical of the two, being geared for the office setting, while the other is mainly for transcription purposes.<br />The major topics touched upon in &quot;The Office Guide&quot; are troublesome similar-sounding words (like 'patients' and 'patience'), foreign words ('id est', or 'i.e.'), and their respective meanings, as well as some of the following topics: proofreaders' and punctuation marks; postal and address guidelines; appropriate grammar use; document formats for letters, memos, agendas, minutes, etc. (includes 12 convenient examples of what some of them should look like); and filing procedures (alphabetic, numeric, etc.). Most of this stuff seems simple enough, but it's amazing how easily it is to goof up on a lot of it. I found numerous common errors I make all the time.<br />I did want to mention that, while &quot;The Office Guide&quot; is functional, most software programs nowadays have templates, spell check, and formatting tools that make writing letters and such less of a headache. Yet for those who are stuck using something from back in the Stone Age, like WordPerfect, then this book is a lifesaver. It's also simple enough to be used in a business, English, and/or computer class setting for middle and high schoolers.	2003-03-28

It's such a pity that they're gone, though books like this one will give fans like me an opportunity to make believe that they're not.<br />&quot;The Calvin and Hobbes Lazy Sunday Book&quot; opens with Calvin's 10-page adventure as Spaceman Spiff, interplanetary explorer extraordinaire, with one mission in mind: to destroy all aliens, which in real life, are disguised as his mother and Susie. Very funny stuff. Yet Calvin's wild imagination doesn't stop there. For the rest of the colorful 100+ pages, he agitates his parents mercilessly, particularly his father; while with his mother, he aversely chokes down every disgusting meal she cooks, making some of the funniest faces while doing so. A lot of times, his expressions say more than any number of words. Take the family meal scene on page 30, where he makes a long-drawn-out attempt at tasting the green pile of gunk on his plate. Then there's a good facial example on page 104, where he's sitting, reading a book; then looks up with this absolutely wicked smile on his face. You can only imagine what he's up to--and it's definitely not safe.<br />Then come the metamorphosis strips where Calvin pretends to be every imaginable type of creature, from a loudmouthed sparrow to a hungry dinosaur to a human slinky and beyond. And, of course, there's always a worthy battle or two with monsters and bedbugs in, around, and under his bed--all in the faithful company of his favorite toy tiger, Hobbes.<br />Two of my favorites in this book involve snowmen. Yep, you guessed it: the one where Calvin creates a morbid snowman display on his parent's car--one of them appears to have been hit by the car, while the other three snowmen gawk at the maimed body (p 53). The other is where he makes a dozen or so little snowmen and then devours them all in a dinosaur frenzy (p 101).<br />No matter how times I've read this book, I can re-read it again and again, and still find something new and amusing about it. Even if you're vaguely familiar with Calvin and Hobbes, I highly recommend purchasing this book. It's a riot.	2003-03-28

Set in Santa Barbara, California, \\"Gimme a Kiss\\" switches point of views between Alice Palmer (during the police interrogation) and her friend, 17-year-old Jane Retton (during the events leading up to the present storyline), though Jane is more of the main character, or at least the one I was rooting for from the beginning. Distinctly, Jane hasn't been on good terms with the promiscuous head cheerleader (Patty Brane--middle name \\"No\\"?) at Wilcox High--and especially of late, when Patty gets a hold of Jane's diary and Xeroxes a juicy page from it, then distributes those copies around school. Jane's boyfriend (Kirk Donner) is of no help either, instigating the rumors and ruining her reputation.<br />So, as a way to get even with Patty and Kirk, Jane uses Alice's weekend yacht party as the perfect place to enact her plans for revenge, which involves her faking her own death and placing the blame on Patty and Kirk. As a few reviewers mentioned before me, this has a clear \\"Fall into Darkness\\" ring to it: staging one's own murder. I also noticed some similarities to \\"Bury Me Deep,\\" mainly because of the scuba diving, though this book doesn't go quite into as much depth about the sport as \\"Bury Me Deep\\" did (thank goodness). This book is also a bit quicker to read than either one (I read it one sitting), being only 152 pages, which comes up a little short in Pike's standards.<br />One thing I didn't quite understand about this book was the title, until I got a dozen or so pages into it. \\"Gimme a kiss\\" is a quote from Jane's fictitious diary, as well as a humorous reference to a \\"scandalous\\" secret at the end about cold sores. And speaking of the end, I think Pike may have inhaled a little nitrous oxide himself when he wrote it. It's deliriously funny, or maybe I was just punch-drunk tired from staying up half the night finishing it.<br />However, I did notice something that may or may not have been a blunder on Pike's part. In the closing scene, some type of gas is released, but there's no mention of what type it is; and since one of the characters had mentioned storing laughing gas in the tanks, I'd have to assume that's what was in them. Yet nitrous oxide is nonflammable. Oopsie.<br />As usual, Pike's wonderful wit, clever plotting, and black humor is rife in this book, creating some rather humorous scenes, like the one I mentioned above about the cold sores. \\"Gimme a Kiss\\" will certainly entertain Pike fans, young and old.	2003-03-27
1180169:US	50720905	R2X4SQTDQ569VK	0590477005	674238662	Skin Deep (Point)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Thought-Provoking, Controversial Novel; Not Just For Kids	While the synopsis on the back cover of \\"Skin Deep\\" leads the reader to believe Laurel Grady is the main character, that role is largely taken by Dan Penner, Laurel's current boyfriend and new high school senior in Boulder, Colorado. The point of view does switch between these two, giving a clear view of the opposing (Laurel) and advocating (Dan) sides of racism.<br />Dan's first glimpse into a hate group is when he watches a group of skinheads rallying at a town Halloween party. But it's not until later that he gets involved, when he witnesses them attacking a Pakistani store clerk, which earns him part of the blame for what they had done. Somewhat reluctantly--though he had shown some awed respect for them earlier--Dan joins this brotherhood as a way for him to feel male kinship and to justify the injustices he feels he's suffered, like being discriminated against because he's white, whether on his high school swim team or while job-hunting.<br />I had to admire Laurel in this book, especially when she dumped Dan after seeing how beat up he was after his \\"initiation.\\" I would have handled the situation in the same way. And, unfortunately, I do know people like Dan, so this book was a reminder of how dangerous hate groups are. It's disturbing in its realistic portrayal of skinheads--or \\"socioeconomic violent counterculture gang menace,\\" as one of Laurel's younger brothers aptly puts it. \\"Skin Deep\\" isn't preachy or one-dimensional, though some readers may draw conclusions that racism is just a one-sided action--white against black. This issue does come up briefly near the end of the book, making it quite clear that hate is hate, no matter what the race.<br />Because \\"Skin Deep\\" tackles some very relevant issues about racism and First Amendment rights, it's appropriate for all ages, not just the intended teen audience; though, as a warning, there is some strong profanity, which might not settle well with everyone. A thought-provoking and controversial book, \\"Skin Deep\\" is worthy of discussions and debates in schools and elsewhere. Highly recommended.	2003-03-27
1181036:US	50720905	R2GZKW89ZGLWIV	0385482736	164840996	Acts of Revision	Books	3	2	2	N	N	"Disorganised...but remarkably alive and original"	Reading \\"Acts of Revision\\" is a little like riding in a car with someone who hasn't quite mastered a stick shift--it moves along rather haphazardly, jumping from past to present. The story is about a 35-year-old Londoner named Gregory Lynn who plots revenge against seven of his childhood teachers. Almost everyone can relate to this aspect of the book, especially if you had a teacher or two (or more) who gave you a lot of trouble in school. However, Gregory doesn't really have any reason to seek revenge. Sure, a few of his teachers had humiliated him, but these events weren't as horrible as you'd expect (he was caught masturbating in class, had a piece of chalk thrown at him, made fun of because of his last name, etc.). He certainly went overboard when he nearly raped one of his teachers, as well as hounding the others and their families with threatening letters and visits.<br />In addition to Gregory's uncalled-for abuse, one of the things that bugged me about this book was that Bedford almost never used quotation marks when he should, making it difficult to tell if a conversation was occurring or not, especially since the book was told in the first person. It also read like a textbook at times, going into great detail about geometry, poets--lots of stuff that isn't really relevant to the story, but something that obviously remained in Gregory's head for a very long time.<br />A couple of quotes from this book aptly describe \\"Acts of Revision,\\" like a report from one of his teachers: \\"His work will become less disjointed and more interesting when he learns to organise his thoughts more carefully,\\" as well as another one, in a letter he received from a teacher: \\"somewhat disorganised and with a tendency to stray from the point, but remarkably alive and original.\\" I did like how each chapter was devoted to a certain subject, like Chapter 1 is history (Mr. Patrick), Chapter 2 is geography (Mrs. Davies-White), and so forth. So, in that regard, it was somewhat tidy. However, within each chapter, he flashes back quite often to his family and their separate deaths, a second storyline that I didn't quite understand the purpose of, other than being page-filler. Possibly to show his fragile side? Who knows.<br />This is more of a low-key psychological novel than a terrifying, bloody thriller (though there are a few violent scenes), which is what I had been expecting. So, yeah, I was a little disappointed; thus my \\"3\\" stars. Yet it does move along rather quickly for being 242 pages, and readers who are into more character-oriented English fiction should like this one.	2003-03-26

Emasculata.\\" In it, a highly infectious disease is transported from a Costa Rican rain forest to a Virginian prison, killing more than a dozen inmates in the process--except for two very dangerous convicts who have escaped. Hence FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are called in to investigate. Scully's responsible for the medical aspect of the investigation--uncovering a secret quarantine that could jeopardize her life--while Mulder is left to do the legwork--tracking down the two suspects, who are not only deadly in the physical sense of the word (they were incarcerated for murder), but they could have infected numerous people as well.<br />It's been a long time since I've seen the episode, so I can't really compare it to this novelization. I did notice, though, that the storyline is fairly similar to Stephen King's \\"The Stand,\\" so if you're into conspiracies, deadly diseases and all that, then you'll probably like \\"Quarantine.\\" However, easily-nauseated readers may want to pass this one up, since there are a few descriptive scenes involving pus-erupting boils and red-orange beetles that dwell inside them. If you're a fast reader, you can probably finish this book in about the same time it would take to watch the episode. It's a breeze to read, considering the spare writing and only 117 pages to get through. Definitely for the young X-Files crowd, but older fans should like it too.	2003-03-25
1183054:US	50720905	R3SFZ5GXPGAZNP	0590453424	724383809	Night Terrors	Books	5	1	1	N	N	"...when our dreams betray us & night terrors take hold."	\\"Night Terrors\\" is a collection of twelve short horror stories for teens--well, five short stories told by Digger (the storyteller) and seven chapters that follow his drifter existence down the Atlantic coast. The first chapter, \\"Digger's Promise,\\" is more of an introduction on how he got into the grave digger profession and received his first promotion before he ever learned to drive. This is a rather amusing tale, in a sick sort of way. Following this, an alternating pattern is set between Digger's life chapters and the stories he's heard over the years, as explained below:<br />\\"Just Say Yes\\" -- Two girls plan on stealing a biology midterm exam as one girl's way of getting the attention of a boy she likes. However, they stumble across a horrible secret of their teacher's in the process. Not too bad, but it's not the best in the bunch. The ending was just the tip of the iceberg.<br />\\"Good Night, Jon; Sleep Tight, Jon\\" -- A couple of guys plan on getting their new \\"friend\\" in trouble by involving him in a grave robbing prank, but it backfires on one of them. One of my favorite stories in here; good twist at the end. I especially liked the last sentence.<br />\\"Like Father, Like Son\\" -- A boy breaks into his father's basement office to perform a ceremony that will awaken the Egyptian mummy his archaeologist father keeps there--except he reawakens something else. Fans of Egyptian mythology should like this one since it scratches the surface of ancient rites, but it isn't tedious in a textbook sort of way.<br />\\"The Cat's-Eye\\" -- While cat-sitting for an old lady, two girls snoop around her house and find a closet full of old clothes--only the closet holds something far more fateful for one of the girls. This one has a \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" feel to it.<br />\\"Something Always Happens\\" -- Three guys are stranded in the middle of nowhere when their car dies. One of them goes for help, but he finds more than he wanted in the marshes, as do his friends. Even though the dialogue of the old woman was a little boring, if you read between the lines, you can probably guess the ending ahead of time.<br />The second to last chapter, \\"Footprints in the Snow,\\" returns to Digger's point of view, where he deals with the death of a close friend (his boss), who was killed by one of the wolves that lives nearby. Digger, once again, moves and finds himself full circle, back in his hometown. He also notices that the pack of wolves has followed him. In this chapter, he--as well as the reader--learns of his true identity, which is no big surprise really. If you take a close look at the picture on the front cover, you can probably figure it out beforehand.<br />All of the stories deal with either peer pressure, conspiracies, or pranks, which most young readers can relate to. The various locales--like empty school halls, tomblike basements, foggy cemeteries, or endless closets--create great atmosphere, as do the monsters that are involved: vampires, ghosts, mummies, witches, cannibals, and werewolves. This book is easy to read, fast-paced (I read it one sitting; it's just under 180 pages), and suspenseful without being gratuitously gory. Young horror fans should enjoy this one.	2003-03-24

(American Girl Collection)	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Fourth Kirsten Book in the American Girls Series	\\"Happy Birthday, Kirsten!\\" takes place on the Minnesota frontier in 1854, where a 9-year-old girl named Kirsten Larson lives with her Swedish immigrant family. In this book, she and her friends plan on making a quilt for their teacher, Miss Winston. However, Kirsten is much too busy with her added chores to be an active part of the group. Not only that, but she's uncertain about whether or not she'll be able to celebrate her upcoming tenth birthday (she was unable to do so the previous year), because of her mother's pregnancy. Despite Kirsten's dilemmas, the story has a happy ending for everyone, involving a new sibling, a litter of kittens, and a barn-raising party.<br />For being such a small book (59 pages), \\"Happy Birthday, Kirsten!\\" has quite a bit of historical info, mainly in the last six pages, titled \\"Growing up in 1854.\\" In addition, there are numerous bright and colorful photos and pictures on practically every page in this book, drawn by the talented Renée Graef. This is an ideal book/series for preteen girls who like historical settings. If you liked this book, then you'll probably enjoy the other Kirsten books in this American Girls series as well.	2003-03-24
1183830:US	50720905	R2CWJKIIEX6A2R	0671743996	646256296	Twin Peaks: An Access Guide to the Town	Books	3	30	37	N	N	Superfluous; Not Enough Info on the Cast/Series	&quot;Twin Peaks: Access Guide to the Town&quot; opens with a puzzling, rather humorous letter from Mayor Milford (isn't he always?), which gives the pace to the rest of this tongue-in-cheek, pseudo-guide of Twin Peaks, Washington. There is some fun stuff in here, like mini bios and mug shots of the more relevant cast members (but why did the waitress from the Great Northern get such a large bio?), town maps, and even the jukebox selections at the Double R Diner, plus some recipes for any Twin Peaker's diet: cherry pie, coffee, and doughnuts.<br />However, this book is absolutely brimming with useless facts, like an excerpt from Andrew Packard's will, a ten-page section on Packard Sawmill (oh, thrills), Washington State history, first explorers, Native American tribes, flora, fauna, geology, weather, and a bizarre advertisement for Tim and Tom's Taxi-dermy (one part blind taxi driver; one part taxidermist). Even if you condensed the more important stuff, it would never reach the current 112 pages, but less than 1/4 of that, if that much.<br />I wouldn't consider this book necessary reading, even if you are a Twin Peaks fan; but if you love to collect Twin Peaks stuff (like I do), then you might consider buying this book. Even so, Twin Peaks fans looking for info on the series will more than likely be disappointed, because this book reads more like a boring tourist guide or junior high history textbook than a TV tie-in. I'd recommend checking out &quot;Welcome to Twin Peaks: A Complete Guide to Who's Who and What's What&quot; and/or &quot;Twin Peaks: Behind the Scenes&quot; instead.	2003-03-23

Not only that, but she's still not over Will Simmons, which makes for a few uncomfortable scenes. In my opinion, she should take Evan's advice and stay single for awhile, sort things out, which, by the title, I thought she'd be doing in this book. Next one then?<br />A plus to \\"On My Own\\" is that Ken Matthews is more in the spotlight, though not exactly on good terms. Apparently he's having problems with his dad, who has been avoiding him because of his demanding job and new girlfriend.<br />Then there's the question that's been lurking in the back of my mind for the past couple of books: Where's Jeremy? He and Ken are the few halfway decent guys in this series and deserve a little more recognition than what they're getting. Well, Angel too, especially since he seems to have fallen off the face of the earth as well. At least Andy Marsden (the comic relief and one of my favorite characters in this series) has considerable time spent on him, mainly dealing with his anxiety and confusion over Six Hansen, the perky sophomore he's asked out on a couple of dates. Good ending between these two, by the way.<br />Overall, this is a good addition to the SVHSY series. Jessica and Ken fans should like this one especially since there's more character development of each one.	2003-03-22

Even after all this time, this is still my favorite book by Neil Gaiman. I even lent it to my sister beforehand, and she finished it off in one day, which was an amazing feat since it took me considerably longer to finish (and I'm usually a faster reader), and she's relatively picky about what she reads. (She gives this book high marks too.)<br />Now on to the plot. (Skip the next two paragraphs if you'd rather not know what this book is about. Don't worry; I've tried to keep all spoilers as to how it ends out.)<br />&quot;Neverwhere,&quot; which is Gaiman's first solo novel (he's co-written a few others, like &quot;Good Omens&quot; with Terry Pratchett, a novel that has considerable similarities to this one), is about Richard Mayhew, a Londoner who saves a wounded young woman (Door) who has somehow stumbled into London Above (the world we live in). She is from London Below, an underground world that has barely changed for hundreds of years.<br />After their meeting, Richard's identity is unexplainably lost--or rather, he becomes somewhat of a ghost. Therefore he must enter London Below and find a way to get his life back, by joining up with Door and her traveling companions--her bodyguard: the infamous Hunter, and the shady marquis de Carabas--who are in an avenging quest to find out who murdered Door's family. Along the way, Richard encounters a colony of subterranean rat-speakers, visits a &quot;moving&quot; market, boards a subway train containing a medieval court, and even has the pleasure of meeting a real live angel (&quot;Good Omens&quot; all over again).<br />&quot;Neverwhere&quot; is a delightfully witty and humorous dark fantasy, though not dark or somber enough to be considered a horror novel, in my opinion. What makes this book so hard to put down--besides the wit and humor--is its fastpace (even though it is 370 pages) and the strikingly well-developed characters, like the protagonist (Richard), who is my favorite in here, though the two assassins are a high second. This is definitely a must-read if you're into fantasies. Like Stephen King's &quot;It&quot;, this book will have you glancing down sewer drains while you're walking and wondering what's below your feet.	2003-03-21

While Ned Nickerson (Nancy Drew's boyfriend) is usually in the background for most of this series, he's more involved in Nancy's 27th case, \\"Most Likely to Die,\\" playing the jealous boyfriend when an old flame of Nancy's shows up at an unofficial River Heights High School reunion. Wendy Harriman, the mean-spirited cheerleader type, is the hostess of this get-together; she's also the first victim of someone who wants revenge. Several other classmates are threatened and harmed, including Nancy. So, it's up to her and her sidekicks--Bess Marvin, George Fayne, and now Ned--to find out who it is. While some of the end-of-chapter cliffhangers were pretty lame, \\"Most Likely to Die\\" was, overall, a very good addition to this series, and fans of this series should like it. Plus it was nice to see Nancy back in her hometown for a change.	2003-03-17

The book does start off that way, following these three runaways on their way to their aunt's house. There they discover that their aunt has been killed--staked through the heart by a possible vampire hunter who wants to punish them for breaking the laws of the Night World, which all vampires, werewolves, and witches must abide by in this series. In an attempt to cover their tracks, the sisters bury the old woman in their backyard, but Mary-Lynnette sees them doing this--and again, later on, in the company of her younger brother, Mark, when they transfer the body into the woods.<br />To make a long story short, Mary-Lynnette and Mark are befriended by these vampires in a blood-tie ceremony and promise to help find the killer running loose in Briar Creek. Like all of L. J. Smith's books, there's an added bit of romance to the paranormal/horror base of the story, for both Mary-Lynnette and Mark. (They meet their respective soulmates: Ash and Jade.) Even though I haven't read any of the other books in this series and can't compare this one to the others, I really liked \\"Daughters of Darkness.\\" It was fast-paced, well-written, and ideal for teens who are into paranormal romances.	2003-03-15

(\\"Dark Dance\\" was another, a book I liked a lot better than this one.) It's about a man named Daniel Vehmund who comes into possession of a powerful diamond that metamorphosizes him into a werewolf during the full moon. It also leads him back to England where his life is intertwined with that of a young country woman's, Laura Wheelwright.<br />By anyone else, \\"Heart-Beast\\" could very well have turned into a \\"cheap thrills\\" werewolf story--not that that's a bad thing; I've read some really good lupine slashers--but coming from Tanith Lee, you know the plot's going to be well thought out and twisted. \\"Heart-Beast\\" is all that, but the book does drag in more than a few places. Although it's not worthy of a \\"5\\" (I had a hard time remembering the story; albeit I was in high school when I read it, I read several other Lee books then too, and most of them were memorable and worthy of five stars), it's not too terrible to deserve a \\"3\\" or lower.<br />In summary: good for Tanith Lee fans, but it's not one of her finest horror novels.	2003-03-15

It was also the first of three other Super Star books that spotlighted certain Sweet Valley characters, like Todd Wilkins, Olivia Davidson, and Bruce Patman.<br />In this one, Lila grows resentful over her father's new girlfriend, Joan Borden, and her 15-year-old daughter, Jacqueline. Lila thinks they're both gold diggers--which they are--but everyone--her father and friends included--seem oblivious to this. But not only are Joan and Jacqueline not what they appear to be, but Lila's new boyfriend (Evan Armstrong, a car racer she stole from his longtime girlfriend--with the help of Bruce Patman) has a surprise of his own for Lila, which involves Jacqueline.<br />As I mentioned before, Lila is certainly cold-hearted, but that's what I liked about her in this book. She was ruthless and punished anyone who took advantage of her, not that she would admit that they had, of course.<br />I did notice a minor goof in this book, though. Did anyone else notice that Jacqueline borrows Lila's car--but the girl is only 15 years old?	2003-03-10

There are bits of facts and history, but it doesn't really go into depth. Sure, you'll probably learn a few things (I did, anyway), but don't expect a complete how-to guide here.<br />The book is organized into four parts, as explained below:<br />\\"Creative Cats\\" -- This six-page section spotlights famous tabby cats, whether in folklore (Puss in Boots) or aviation history (\\"Jazz, the only animal aboard the first airship to fly the Atlantic\\") or even film (Stephen King's \\"Cats Eye\\").<br />\\"Gallery of Cats\\" -- The longest chapter in here (at approximately 18 pages), \\"Gallery of Cats\\" is just that--a photo gallery of cats. All types are shown here--Chocolate Tabby Angora, Exotic Shorthair, Maine Coon, Chocolate Lynx-point, Blue Classic Tabby Persian, and Non-Pedigree (the typical household tabby)--and each breed is given a double-page spread, pointing out each one's origins, \\"cateristics\\"/quirks, you name it. While I really enjoyed this section, I didn't quite understand why other breeds were added, since this is a book on tabbies. Still, a great visually-beautiful chapter.<br />\\"Me and My Cat\\" -- This is a really fun part of the book. Here you're given a two-page \\"Purr-sonal History\\" for your cat where you can document his/her features, favorite things, and \\"firsts,\\" as in the first time s/he opened his/her eyes, gave you a \\"mouse-gift,\\" etc. While a cutesy idea for doting owners, there really isn't enough room to go into detail, and it's only just for one cat. Also in this section, cat-naming tips are given, along with 13 possible names and their meanings. But my favorite part would have to be the cat horoscopes.<br />\\"Practical Cat\\" -- This is where all the facts are given, starting with what to look for when choosinga kitten (nothing on adult cats, though, but the same rules apply), understanding \\"cat chat,\\" creating cuisine treats (which I found absolutely revolting, being a vegan, but there are snack options like cantaloupe and other veggies/fruits, which some of my cats prefer over meat), grooming and health, and a final A-Z care guide. A lot of this stuff is just common sense (like cat-proofing your house as you would if you had a child there), but for some readers, it may be something new.<br />It goes without saying that \\"The Little Tabby Cat Book\\" is ideal for cat lovers, but it's especially perfect for tabby lovers. Worth buying if you are such a person.	2003-03-09

It's owned by Lillian Booth's family, which consists of her parents, her religious older sister (Emily), and her sickly younger sister (Eugenia--which, Cutler fans will notice, was Dawn Longchamp's proper first name).<br />Lillian, who is better known as simply Grandmother Cutler in this series, has about the same life as most other V. C. Andrews heroines. Her innocence is lost over the years when 1) she discovers a shocking family secret: that her parents aren't really her parents, 2) two people close to her die (Eugenia and her first boyfriend, Niles Thompson), and 3) she's raped by her uncle, resulting in an unwanted pregnancy. ... <br />Probably my favorite part in \\"Darkest Hour,\\" though it is rather morbid, is when Lillian's young boyfriend dies after sneaking out of her bedroom window one night, and he's found \\"the next morning, crumpled beside the house, his neck broken from the fall.\\" This was an interesting twist to the book since most boyfriends live until the very end. His death is just one of many things that make Lillian believe her older sister--that she is, in fact, evil; that everything she does turns to pot (to put it in Amazon.com-friendly terms). While her self-esteem plummets, Lillian creates a shell around herself to resist any more pain, turning her into the hard woman that she is later renowned for in this series.<br />Although I wasn't really into the Cutler family series (I enjoyed the Dollanganger and Casteel ones a lot more), \\"Darkest Hour\\" is one the remaining few books that still seems to resemble an original V. C. Andrews plot. After this series, most of the others are just copycats of the same old incestuous story line.	2003-03-08

Stine, for example, who has contributed a lot to this line of teen thrillers), \\"Be Mine\\" barely makes it into either category. The front cover is certainly misleading with a knife stabbing a cherry-flavored piece of chocolate, since there's no real bloodshed or violence in the story (though the protagonist does get some bad rope burns), which makes \\"Be Mine\\" ideal for those who are just starting to get into suspense books. It's also an unusual addition to this imprint because of its length. Typically Scholastic Thrillers are just under 200 pages, but this one is 245 pages long, which might be a turn-off to those who aren't willing to read an additional 50 pages.<br />The book revolves around 18-year-old Bethany Anderson, a senior in Delaware, who has a secret admirer that has been leaving her red heart stickers and roses in her locker and at her home, as well as calling her in the middle of the night. Who he is is impossible to figure out, despite his occasional first-person narratives, but \\"Be Mine\\" is still a great young adult book. It has plenty of humor, courtesy of Bethany's sex-crazed boyfriend (Starling is definitely my favorite character in here, though Bethany is just as likable and intelligent), and will certainly appeal to teen readers who like low-key suspense, but aren't into all the gore that typically goes along with it.	2003-03-07

However, there is quite a gap from when she lived in Stoneybrook to the point when she returned to NYC; so don't expect a very complete autobiography--it just covers the years that she was in NYC, prior to the Baby-sitters Club series starting. Still, fans of this series--and especially of Stacey--should like \\"Stacey's Book.\\"	2003-03-06

Her death marks one of many tragedies that taints the Craig and Von Vechten names, two families that have, for generations, made a fortune together; but eventually greed, infidelity, and murder ruin their bond. Bader Von Vechten's marriage to Katherine Craig had appeared to bridge the gap between the two families, but it's soon destroyed when Bader has sex with a 15-year-old boy, Lee Kimbel, while engaged to Katherine. This affair sounds like it would be graphic and shocking, right? But it's really quite tame and nonexistent, with brief implied sex rather than any gratuitous homoerotic passages.<br />The pacing in \\"Dancing on Glass\\" is oftentimes slow and weighed down with details and character stories, which is a plus and minus--the plus being Chehak's writing style is good, but there's very little dialogue or action, except for the tragic outcome in the last few pages of the second part. It's also hard to follow at times--it changes narrative constantly, moves erratically over a 25-year time frame, and has too many characters, most of whom aren't very interesting or likable, such as Mudd Kimbel, who had a considerable amount of pages devoted to her, but she doesn't have any major role in this book, except as Lee's mother.<br />Yet, at the same time, Chehak's flowing prose draws you right into the story, regardless of the book's flaws. So, if you like small-town drama, then you might like \\"Dancing on Glass,\\" though you'll have to wade through several pages before you actually get to the dirt.	2003-03-06

As if that weren't frightening enough, Marcus believes he may have killed his girlfriend, Jules, in a bizarre fit in the woods.<br />Leaving this mystery unanswered for the moment (hopefully it'll be resolved in one of the following two books: \\"Dark Prince\\" and \\"Blood War\\"), he, his mother, and his \\"familiar\\" (Chuck, a bluetick hound) move to Blackwater, where he meets a coven of Celtic witches who know more about him than he knows about himself. But what's even eerier--and what could possibly send him over the edge--is that one of his female classmates looks exactly like Jules.<br />While told in the first person, which you would think would make the story more revealing, I found \\"Witch Boy\\" rather confusing, mainly because of Moon's surreal, complicated writing style. While it's a nice change of pace from most teen fiction (the profanity was definitely unexpected), I think this book/trilogy is better suited for more advanced teen readers (or even adults) who are into fantasy and Celtic mythology. The cliffhanger at the end of \\"Witch Boy\\" will certainly make fans want to read the next two books.	2003-03-06
1205498:US	50720905	R395FW5CDXB8S8	0064408019	597037727	The Black Book: Diary of a Teenage Stud, Vol. IV: Faster, Faster, Faster	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Fourth and Last Book in The Black Book Series	For some reason, I always have a knack for buying books out of order, like I did with this one. But when I found \\"Faster, Faster, Faster\\" the other day in a used bookstore, I had to buy it, remembering it was one of the titles Amazon.com had recommended to me. (Amazon.com rarely lets me down.) Now, after just finishing this book, I'll certainly be looking for the other three.<br />Anyway, Volume IV takes place in Pompano Beach, Florida, where eleventh-grader Jonah Black currently lives with his sexually liberal mother and scary-but-genius sister, Honey. This book/series is set up to read like a diary with date logs instead of chapters, but, as I've mentioned in other reviews about teen diaries, it's obvious this book/series isn't a real one. For starters, it's too coherent. Conversations and details are written in-depth, which would be nearly impossible to do if you were really writing in a diary. But the first-person viewpoint does create a closeness to Jonah, and the use of AOL chats and e-mails are a nice touch, which most young computer-savvy readers will like.<br />About halfway into the book, Jonah and Honey make a road trip to Pennsylvania to visit their father and his new wife, plus check out dorm rooms at Harvard for Honey. Jonah uses the trip as the perfect opportunity to visit his old school and \\"save\\" Sophie O'Brien from herself, an institutionalized girl friend who has been plaguing his mind for a long time. It's no real surprise that he's attracted to her; he's a little out there himself, which is obvious right from the first chapter, where he's daydreaming about her while taking the SATs.<br />Jonah is just your typical spaced-out, horny teenage boy, which should probably appeal to the same crowd. I, however, didn't care much for Jonah, probably because 1) I'm not in this age or gender group, and 2) Jonah and his friends reminded me a lot of the guys I knew back in high school, as well as a few that I know now--and, no, they rarely mature past puberty(though Jonah does mature somewhat by the end of this book).<br />Despite these character flaws I complain about, they are what make this book/series work. It's realistic, truthful, and quite refreshing from most of the other teen books out there. The ending is fairly good as well (Jonah finally discovers who Northgirl999 is), but it does leave you hanging a bit, especially since this is the last book in the series.	2003-03-05

Ten years ago in Halkirk, Minnesota, five gifted college students (Jo Granville, Ryan Locke, Larry Kirby, Neal Gowar, and Kendra Bennet) were involved in a psychic experiment, masterminded by Professor Wakely and the FBI, to \\"build the profile of a serial killer.\\" Now that imaginary killer (known as Joshua Valentine) has somehow become real and is eager to kill again--unless these five friends can stop him.<br />While \\"Bloody Valentine\\" is just over 400 pages, it's relatively fast-paced and suspenseful (though a lot of time is spent channeling Joshua), thanks to George's easy-to-read, terse writing. To be honest, I didn't know what to expect from this book when I first picked it up. By the title and cover alone (blood in the title and on the cover, seeping out of a woman's eyes like tears, mirrored in a descending knife blade), I expected a run-of-the-mill slasher, especially coming from Zebra, not that I'm knocking them. In fact, I support any publisher that still prints horror. It's just hard to find anything original published after the '80s. (\\"Bloody Valentine\\" was published in January 1994.)<br />Anyway, after a couple chapters into it, I couldn't put the book down. I was certainly impressed. \\"Bloody Valentine\\" is one of the few exceptionally-written supernatural horror novels that I've read in a long time. It's well worth your time and money if you're into this genre.	2003-03-04

With the help of her two friends (Bess Marvin and George Fayne), Nancy Drew is on her way to Los Angeles to investigate \\"three cases of extortion and arson involving Napoleonic relics\\"--a mini portrait, a manuscript, and a gown appropriately referred to as the Flame. However, Nancy and her two sidekicks barely leave the airport before their lives are threatened when someone plants a bomb in Nancy's purse--and that's just the beginning.<br />Despite the cliffhangers at the end of the chapters and the relatively fast pace, \\"Playing With Fire\\" wasn't a very suspenseful or interesting book; but I suppose if you're a Nancy Drew fan and history buff, then you might like this 26th case. There are the usual shameful plugs of other cases from The Nancy Drew Files, like the previous one in \\"Rich and Dangerous\\" and #13: \\"Wings of Fear,\\" as well as the customary case overview at the beginning of the book, which is useful since there are so many characters; it's hard to determine who's a suspect and who's not until the last few chapters--but possibly earlier on if you can differentiate between the characters.	2003-02-25

For their new Media class project at Middlefield Academy, Andy McBain, David Reese, and Miles Taylor plan on producing their own TV news program called SNN (School News Network). The three girls--Holiday Friedman, Nikki Watson, and Molloy Simpson--plan on publishing their own newspaper: 'The Middlefield News and World Report'. And Mark \\"the Shark\\" Stark is on his own with a radio talk show: WJAW. At first, things look promising for most of the seven freshman; but things start to go downhill for all of them when competition and jealousy get in the way of their friendship with one another. Will any of them still be on talking terms by the end of the semester?<br />Although I never watched Running the Halls when it aired back in the '90s, I thought \\"Media Madness\\" was really pretty good. It had plenty of humor and some romance; plus it was easy to read and sparely written, ideal for those who aren't into reading a lot--it's only 144 pages, too. But one of the things that bugged me was the character point of view, which seemed to fly all over the place. Not only that, but a couple of the characters were really rather superficial and one-dimensional, namely the popular couple, Andy and Holiday, though the head cheerleader was certainly the worst, personality-wise. But I'm sure fans of this series will be able to overlook these tiny flaws. Overall, it's worth reading if you're a Running the Halls fan.	2003-02-25

Jessica gets dumped in the second chapter by Will Simmons for his ex, Melissa Fox (big surprise there--not); but Jess doesn't waste any time rebounding with one of Conner McDermott's sarcastic friends (Evan Plummer), though she starts to have her doubts about Evan, not that I blame her--he was pretty rude. Besides, we already have one mismatched couple--Liz and Conner--we don't really need another, in my opinion. And Andy, in an attempt to find his niche, joins the SVH Outdoors Club, only to have a perky sophomore named Six Hanson fall head over heels for him. How he feels about Six, though, is still unclear.<br />Now back to Tia: At the end of \\"All About Love\\" (the previous book), Tia had cheated on her college boyfriend (Angel Desmond) with Trent Maynor, which was quite ironic, since she had been the one fearing Angel would cheat on her first with some busty coed. Anyway, Tia feels guilty about it--but not enough to stop seeing Trent. Tsk tsk, Tia.<br />\\"Split Decision\\" isn't one of my favorite SVHSY books, probably because I'm not much of a Tia fan, but it was interesting to see how things worked out between her, Trent, and Angel. Worth reading if you're into teen love triangles and especially if you're a SVHSY fan.	2003-02-25

It's also one of those books I had to read a second time to like, basically because my first impression was one of disappointment. I had thought \\"Strange Angels\\" was about--what else?--angels or some other type of supernatural entity, going by the synopsis on the back cover. However, I must have misinterpreted it, because the book isn't supernatural at all. It's about a photographer named Grant who becomes obsessed with his girlfriend's client, a mental patient named Robin, after he sees some of his drawings. Grant's interest in him has its repercussions, though, especially when he isolates Robin from his doctors and family in attempt to understand him better.<br />Koja's schizophrenic writing style perfectly suits the chaotic madness in both Grant and Robin's minds, making the story come more alive. Unfortunately, the ending is rather predictable and somewhat misleading. Mental disorders aren't as contagious as catching something like the flu, which makes me guess Grant wasn't all there to begin with. So, if you're into low-key, psychological horror, then you might like \\"Strange Angels.\\"	2003-02-25

While Scotty Singleton's longtime girlfriend is away on a one-week European vacation, he goes out on a secret date with Shannon Smith, a classmate at Glenview High. Afterwards, out of guilt and disinterest, he breaks his \\"relationship\\" off with Shannon. However, she refuses to accept it and uses violence to get his attention--first by killing his pet snake (unfortunately, this isn't the last pet to die), then by breaking his hand, and finally by setting his car on fire. Now, although Shannon is supposed to be scary, I thought she was flat-out annoying--pestering him with nonstop phone calls and referring to him as \\"baby\\" all the time, though Scotty is just as guilty of overusing his favorite word \\"bogus.\\"<br />As is Stine's typical writing style, \\"The Girlfriend\\" is meagerly written and fast-paced (a good combination when trying to get the book over with), but his tiring use of cliffhangers at the end of chapters hits a few snags when the succeeding chapters don't resume with the same scene, but jump forward in time or into a dream. This makes the story rather uneven in places. I will give him credit, though, for the somewhat dark twist regarding the fight Scotty and Shannon have at the end of the book. Unfortunately, he ruins it with a disappointing return-from-the-dead ending.<br />Stine fans will probably like this book, but other readers looking for a book about \\"obsessed exes\\" might want to look elsewhere.	2003-01-25

While Winnie doesn't have a problem with the Garbers being black, several of her neighbors do since the area had always been occupied by white residents. So out of loyalty to her new friends, Winnie sets out to crusade against the racism in her neighborhood.<br />Although \\"Iggie's House\\" isn't my favorite Judy Blume book (though I doubt I'll ever give her less than 5 stars on any book), she's great at tackling social problems, such as racism in this book, showing how children typically see things in just black and white, so to speak. Though prejudices aren't as easily overcome as shown here, \\"Iggie's House\\" is still a great learning tool for preteens.	2003-01-24

The narrative alternates between the first-person (the protagonist: Lindsay) and the second-person (her friends and the killer). The book is set up in four parts, as explained below:<br />Book One--A newlywed couple is murdered on their honeymoon, and Inspector Lindsay Boxer of the San Francisco Police Department is assigned to the case, along with a new partner: Chris Raleigh, who becomes Lindsay's love interest.<br />Book Two--Another two newlywed couples are killed. Lindsay organizes a women's murder club to help her solve the three murders, consisting of her best friend (Claire Washburn, a medical examiner) and recently-made friend (Cindy Thomas, a newspaper reporter). How these latter two women become friends is a bit unbelievable--Cindy finds Lindsay crying in the bathroom, and Lindsay just decides to befriend this random reporter. I would have expected more caution from Lindsay, but there it is. Also in this second part, a suspect is fingered--prominent novelist, Nicholas Jenks.<br />Book Three--Jill Bernhardt, the assistant district attorney, is added to the \\"club,\\" and the investigation gets into full swing. Book Four, of course, reveals the true identity of the killer--which I won't give away. Even though I wasn't able to guess the killer, I did suspicion something about him/her during the first murder investigation (despite the name of the killer that's given), mainly because of the type of sexual deviance performed on the bride. (A clue.) Nevertheless, the ending is certainly surprising; I wasn't expecting it. This is my first Patterson book (though I have seen a couple of his movies), and if his others are as suspenseful and quick as this one, then I'll probably continue reading his mysteries.	2003-01-23

This discovery leads him into the company of dark alchemists, the Guild of Mask Makers--and ultimately into the arms of Eurydiche, a woman whose mask is her actual face--a well-woven twist to the authentic Carnival atmosphere.<br />Although it's been a long time since I've read this book (I had to browse through it again to remember most of the story in order to write this review), I do recall &quot;Faces&quot; was rather slow-paced, particularly in the beginning half, and not as exciting or intriguing as Lee's Paradys series, which this series appears to imitate. Based on this book alone, I doubt I'll like her new Venus series. There are three additional books to it--&quot;Saint Fire,&quot; &quot;A Bed of Earth,&quot; and &quot;Venus Preserved&quot;--but I'll probably stick with her Paradys series instead, one I'd recommend over this series.	2003-01-23

After that knight-in-shining-armor scene, it appears that Conner is half-man enough to get involved with Liz once again, where before he was too commitment-phobic to even speak to her, for fear of being tied down to one person.<br />Will Simmons and Jessica Wakefield are obviously having some problems in this book. For starters, Will repeatedly compares Jessica to his long-term ex-girlfriend, Melissa Fox; and Jessica thinks Will is being too possessive and pushy for her taste--plus she's not entirely over her ex either. Things get worse, though, when they decide to double date with Conner and Elizabeth, and one of them walks out during the meal.<br />Personally, I've never cared for Will. He's obviously not over Melissa, and I still can't excuse his previous spineless behavior concerning the rumors about Jessica.<br />Meanwhile, Andy Marsden, the joke-cracking slacker (one of my favorite characters in this book), is trying to get \\"serious\\" (if you can ever call him that) about raising his GPA and SAT scores for college--but fails miserably. It's amusing how easily he's distracted, like when he finds his old Game Boy hiding on the floor of his closet.<br />Overall, \\"All About Love\\" is another great addition to the SVH Senior Year series, though the title is a little misleading if you're expecting an in-depth explanation on love or expect everyone to be happy with who they're currently with--and that just won't happen, because where would the fun be in that? The unknown ghostwriter (Francine Pascal is just the creator of this series, not the actual writer) continues to generate enjoyably fast-paced stories that are barely printed fast enough for her(?) hungry fans, who can usually devour one or more of them a day. The chat room conversations, short stories, and journal entries certainly make this series more hip and popular than other teen romance series out there.	2003-01-21

If you can get through this first chapter, then you can probably make it through the rest of the book.<br />Thirty-eight-year-old Detective Larry Foggia is assigned to the case because of his unconventional methods of solving crimes. His investigation leads him into the occult--seances, talking hands, shrinking people, and the like. But as he delves deeper into the supernatural, his life and soul--including those of his family--become greatly at risk of being taken by Belial.<br />Generally, I don't like reading books that have extremely long chapters (this one averages about 37 pages a chapter), but once I started \\"Master of Lies\\" I couldn't put it down, probably because of the graphic first chapter. The beginning half of the book is enthralling, but as the story progresses, it began to get a little absurd, i.e., magically-shrinking women; so I had to give it a 4-star rating instead of a 5. However, I'd still recommend this book to Masterton fans, as well as Dean Koontz fans who are into the supernatural horror genre.	2003-01-20

Billy's given three simple rules to abide by: don't expose it to sunlight (or else it will die), don't get it wet (or else it will multiply into more Mogwai--or Gremlins, depending on its current stage), and never feed it after midnight (or else it will metamorphosize into a killer Gremlin).<br />While I love the movie, I wasn't too pleased with this loose novelization of the film. The author seemed to want to write his own version of \\"Gremlins\\"; he barely stuck to the script--dropping, adding, and altering several scenes along the way. This is evident right from the beginning with the prologue--a quick but unimportant explanation of the Mogwai's origin as alien beings on the planet Enz. (Since when?)<br />The one good thing about this book, though, is the dozen or so color photos taken from the movie. The cute black-and-white illustrations of Gizmo and Spike at the beginning of each chapter are also a nice touch.<br />The intended audience for this book is apparently preteens, though it's appropriate for all ages.

Ben Oliver, a new student at Sweet Valley High, has become Steven Wakefield's newest enemy after he replaces Steven as starting center on their JV basketball team, forcing Steven to play guard. Then Steven loses the freshman class election as treasurer to Ben by one vote--which was made by Steven's own girlfriend. But the worst part is that Ben is dating Steven's sixth-grade sister, Jessica. While Jessica finds Ben boring and annoying after awhile, she continues seeing him as a way to bug her older brother, as well as gain the admiration and envy from her close friends (the Unicorns) for dating a high school guy. Steven, in return, plots to get Jessica back by dating Veronica Brooks, Jess's arch rival.<br />As these two overreact and plot revenge against each other, I began to wonder if maybe Steven's number one enemy wasn't Ben, but Jessica. I mean, these two never seem to get along, and not just in this book. Yet \\"Steven's Enemy\\" has a relatively happy ending, particularly for both pair of enemies (Ben and Veronica), who find their perfect match.<br />During her siblings' complicated little battle, Liz Wakefield tries not to get caught in the middle of it, which is usually what happens. Instead, she's busy playing detective with Amy Sutton, trying to figure out why Amy's parents are fighting. While Liz does find some upsetting clues, this story line isn't resolved by the end of \\"Steven's Enemy.\\" It continues with the next book: \\"Amy's Secret Sister,\\" in which part of the secret is revealed in the title.	2003-01-14

Everything goes wrong, though, once Chris takes the two Anderson kids (Brad and Sarah) and their friend (Daryl Coopersmith) into the city so she can pick up her best friend (Brenda Pidgjocki), who just ran away from home. Yet before they can find Brenda, one accident after another befalls them--their tire blows out on the freeway, they're towed by a scary-looking car mechanic with a hook for a hand, followed by being rescued by a car thief, chased by crooks, and involved in a gang war. But the night is still young, and they have yet to find Brenda and get home in one piece before their parents find out.<br />This is the next best thing to watching the movie, particularly if you don't have a VCR/DVD player handy. I read this book a lot when I was in middle school, though I watched the movie even more. This is a good novelization of one of the cheesiest comedy flicks from the '80s. The only drawback is that are no pictures of the movie inside, just one group shot on the back cover. Also, some of the profanity was altered, like Brad's favorite \\"h\\" name for Thor, Sarah's fair-haired superhero, possibly because of the younger readers who might read this book. Still, this book is worth owning if you're really into the \\"Adventures in Babysitting\\" movie.	2003-01-12

Most of the book is devoted to just one-liners (not the entire song), with the lyric on one side of the page and the song title, band/artist, and bits of trivia on the opposite side. Some of the sections in the book feature one-hit wonders (like Kajagoogoo {&quot;Too Shy&quot;} and Toni Basil {&quot;Mickey&quot;}), actors-turned-singers (like Patrick Swayze {&quot;She's Like the Wind&quot; in 'Dirty Dancing'} and Rick Springfield), as well as bits of movie, TV, and celebrity trivia, but only if it pertains to a certain '80s song. There are also lots of black-and-white photos (pretty much on every page) of singers/performers/actors, like Debbie (Deborah now) Gibson, Michael and Janet Jackson, Mr. T, Weird Al, and the Brat Pack, just to name a few.<br />Despite some of the catty remarks and photo alterations (see Mary Lou Retton and Lionel Richie), this book will certainly make you laugh and reminisce if you're a child of the '80s. It's hard to digest all of the info in this book in one sitting (flipping back and forth between the lyrics and answers does lose its appeal after awhile), but halfway into it, you'll be dusting off your old CDs/cassettes/vinyls and playing them while reading this book. The only gripe I have is that there's no index or table of contents to find certain pages quicker; other than that, &quot;Who Can It Be Now?&quot; is a fun and nostalgic trip back to the '80s. Worth reading if you're an '80s fanatic like I am.	2003-01-04

When 10-year-old Christina Rose and her family (her father and twin brother, Danny) move to North Klondike, California, from New York, she wasn't expecting to move into a haunted house--or have her mother's ghost follow them. So, being a somewhat eccentric child (she claims to have Ghost Radar), Christina starts a ghost club called Ghost Hunters I.N.K. (In North Klondike) and sets out to uncover the truth about the unexplained events in her new house, with the help of her neighbors: Roberto Wing, his psychic mother, and Professor Imogen Barrymore, a parapsychologist.<br />\\"The Very Real Ghost Book of Christina Rose\\" is a great book for preteens who are into the paranormal. It doesn't rely heavily on overused ideas about ghosts, such as white sheets, moaning noises, or murderous spirits. Instead, Christina documents \\"real\\" ghost stories, as told from her friends and family--with black and white illustrations--to make the book seem more believable.	2003-01-03

During her six-month stay in France, Phoebe falls in love with Ben Reuben (a rich artist friend of Marlys' who lets Phoebe board with him), and she exposes some shocking secrets along the way.<br />It's been years since I've read this book (sometime during my junior or senior year of high school), but this is still one of my favorite books. Phoebe's first person narrative and wit is wickedly amusing and honest. If you like adult books by Judy Blume, then you might like &quot;The Book of Phoebe.&quot; Highly recommended.	2003-01-02

As Susan Walker, a journalist for 'The Playa Linda Register,' investigates the unexplained occurrences around town (with the help of her boyfriend, Matt Reiley), she begins to fear something evil is at hand.<br />Her suspicions are heightened when she accompanies her friend (Lacey Robinson) to a faith healer (Brother Justin), who \\"cures\\" Lacey's mother of ovarian cancer, though the woman dies a short time later. As Susan helplessly watches her best friend being \\"led astray\\" by the occult--visiting seances and trance channellers--and as Susan receives threatening phone calls, Susan fears her assignment may cost her her life--not to mention the lives of those around her.<br />The beginning of \\"Shadow People\\" was promising, but with the numerous misconceptions that witchcraft/Wicca and Satanism are the same religion, the rest of the book became quite irksome, and it took me a lot longer to finish this book than I thought it would. Christians who like horror/mystery novels might like \\"Shadow People,\\" though, since it's mostly told from a Christian perspective, but for those who aren't, it probably won't hold your interest for very long.	2002-12-30

While second-grader Elizabeth Wakefield is home sick with a stomachache, Jessica Wakefield pretends to be her twin sister for fun. However, when Todd Wilkins invites her to play a small part in a TV movie that's being filmed at his house (thinking that she's Liz), Jessica is conflicted about whether or not she should tell Liz--or just take the part for herself since she really wants to be on TV.<br />Whether or not Jessica learns her lesson by the end of the story is never really crucial to any Sweet Valley book--including this one--since Jessica always acts the same--selfish and underhanded--by the next book. Still, for those of you who are Jessica fans, you might like this 16th addition to the Sweet Valley Kids series. Recommended for readers age 5 - 8.	2002-12-28

Shortly after moving to Los Angeles from New York with her husband (Ben), 27-year-old Kate Davis meets a seductive man named Justin in her acting class, who she has a short but horrifying affair with. After that one night, Kate is made into a vampire against her will and then ultimately abandoned.<br />After spending a couple years aimlessly roaming L.A.'s streets and befriending an elderly woman (Lil) who is later killed by a werewolf (Henry), Kate takes a gambling hiatus in Las Vegas, where her love for music is renewed. She then returns to Los Angeles to become a musician, by targeting and then snuffing out a band's (The Uninvited) bass player and taking his place.<br />Despite the band's growing success, Kate can't ignore her quarterly blood lust or her weakening humanity. There is also the added danger of being discovered, whether by the detective who is still investigating the previous bass player's death or by her paranoid band mate (Charly). And then there's Drew, the lead singer of The Uninvited, who Kate has fallen hopelessly in love with. But can she suppress her need to kill while she's with him--or will Drew just be another one of her victims?<br />\\"The Making of a Monster\\" isn't one of my absolute favorite vampire novels, nor is it as erotic or scary as I had expected, considering the suggestive front cover and the tagline; but it's a relatively quick read and quite enthralling. Gail Petersen's previous experience as a musician/songwriter in the alternative rock band, The Catholic Girls, comes into play a lot in this book (after all, this book was inspired by a vampire song she had written), as well as her strict Catholic upbringing. Both elements give Kate's own musical and religious struggle a bit more credibility. This book is certainly worth a try if you're a vampire lover. Also recommended: Anne Rice's \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" (vampire musician).	2002-12-27

When 17-year-old Miranda Peterson wins a magazine contest--along with two other girls: Kelly McCormick and Jo Brown--she's absolutely ecstatic. This is her big chance to meet Byron Slater, a popular actor who's allowing three young women to reside at his California estate for one week; and one lucky contest winner gets a part in his upcoming movie. However, when several near-death \\"accidents\\" befall Miranda and Byron--such as being poisoned, almost drowned, and nearly driven off a cliff--Miranda begins to have her doubts about staying with Byron, even though he's been incredibly attentive towards her, and even discloses an awful secret--that someone has been threatening him, possibly an obsessed fan.<br />There are a few parts in \\"Starstruck\\" that are a bit far-fetched; for example: Byron's immediate attraction to Miranda. I'm not saying Miranda couldn't attract someone like him, but it was very unlikely; and, besides, Miranda is a minor--something Byron should have kept in mind if he were so worried about bad press. I also didn't understand why Byron would invite her to stay in his house instead of the guesthouse with the other two girls--as well as why he would confide his fears to her about a dangerous stalker--when Miranda could possibly have been that person? Obviously she's not since she's the protagonist, but Byron's decision-making skills--among other things--seemed a little off to begin with. I won't give too much away, but at least one good thing about \\"Starstruck\\" is that Miranda hooks up with the guy I thought she should have done so with at the beginning of the book.	2002-12-27

I really enjoy Eve Bunting's books, and \\"Someone is Hiding on Alcatraz Island\\" is no exception. It's told in the first person by 14-year-old Danny Sullivan, who avoids four bullies from school (the Outlaws) by hiding out on Alcatraz Island while on a tour of the landmark prison. However, the Outlaws have the same idea, and soon Danny is involved in a nightly cat-and-mouse game through the abandoned building with a young park ranger, Biddy. But will either one of them leave the island alive?<br />This a very fast-paced book and only 136 pages, which should appeal to more lax preteen readers. The setting is perfect, and the history of Alcatraz is significant in foreshadowing the latter events of this book.	2002-12-25

First up, Brittany dislikes all of the attention her college boyfriend (Jack) is showing her family, because she's ashamed of them. Brittany tries everything she can to keep Jack and her family apart, though she has some difficulty keeping her young lovesick sister at bay.<br />And in fitting with the title of this book, it seems that Robin Fisher has gone too far with her steady boyfriend (Calvin) and fears she may be pregnant, which puts strain on their relationship since Robin won't tell him what's wrong. And Brittany, being the sneaky gossip that she is, finds out about Robin's secret (though she's not certain if it's Robin who is pregnant or one of her friends) and spreads it around River Heights High.<br />I thought this was a somewhat risque topic, considering it's written under Carolyn Keene's name. The situation was handled quite well, though, especially with some help from Robin's loyal friends, who not only accompany her to the ob-gyn clinic, but take some of the heat off her when the rumors start going around school. Overall, this is a good addition to the River Heights series.	2002-12-22

Shortly after it, her parents (Dawn and Jimmy) tragically die in a house fire that destroys part of Cutler's Cove Hotel. Christie and her 12-year-old brother (Jefferson) are then \\"adopted\\" by Uncle Philip and his family; but after Uncle Philip rapes her, Christie runs away with Jefferson to New York City, in the hopes her real father (Michael Sutton) will be a better-suited guardian--which he's not.<br />Gavin Longchamp (Christie's forbidden love and \\"stepuncle\\") then enters the picture, joining Christie and Jefferson in a trip to The Meadows that's similar to the one Dawn made in \\"Secrets of the Morning,\\" except Christie isn't pregnant--well, not yet anyway, but after what happens between her and Gavin at the old Virginia plantation, it shouldn't take too long before she is.<br />I rarely, if ever, like the third generation of heroines in V. C. Andrews books (like Annie Stonewall in \\"Gates of Paradise\\"), and Christie Longchamp is no exception. She's spoiled, immature, and weak. Giving this book a \\"4\\" rating is rather generous on my part, but since it's been eons since I've read this book--and I don't remember my initial reaction to it--I decided to give \\"Midnight Whispers\\" a \\"4.\\" Thankfully, this is the only book told from Christie's p.o.v.; \\"Darkest Hour,\\" the next and last book in this series, follows the life of Grandmother Cutler.	2002-12-18

This year Lizzie wants to be more popular. To do this, she starts hanging around Samantha Howard, a girl both Lizzie and her best friend hate--or, at least, someone Lizzie used to hate. But as Samantha starts helping Lizzie fit in, by first redecorating her bedroom into a garish New Wave style and then persuading her to have a slumber party, Lizzie can't help but suspect that there's a hidden reason for Samantha's sudden niceness. But what's even worse is that Lizzie could possibly lose her best friend because of it.<br />Like a lot of books written in diary form, \\"The Party\\" doesn't really read like a diary. For starters, people rarely remember full conversations hours/days after they've happened, enough to write them down word for word in their diary. Still, Lizzie's first-person narrative makes \\"The Party\\" appealing to 8 to 12-year-old girls, especially ones who are faced with the same social problems of preadolescence, i.e., popularity and friendships.	2002-12-17

But who keeps sending him these letters? And what exactly do they want from him?<br />Like a lot of Pike's books, \\"Master of Murder\\" has plenty of surprising plot twists, true-to-life characters who do some pretty crazy things in the name of love, as well as a one-year-old murder that comes back to haunt everyone. This is a very engrossing and fast-paced book, and if you're a diehard Pike fan, you'll more than likely wonder how much of this book is autobiographical, since Christopher Pike (real name: Kevin McFadden) is such a private writer, just like Marvin.<br />_____<BR>*(The synopsis inaccurately states Marvin is 18 years old; he's really 17.)<BR>**(Another error: Marvin's teen thriller series is called \\"The Mystery at Silver Spring\\" in the synopsis; it's really \\"The Mystery of Silver Lake\\".)	2002-12-11

A few people--namely Brody's family--don't believe he's guilty of Zoe's death, but that isn't evidence enough to release him from prison. So, out of loyalty to Jake and his family, Cici attempts to uncover the one-year-old summer murder mystery, but after some amateur sleuthing, Cici fearfully realizes that the killer may be someone very close to her, possibly someone in her own family.<br />In addition to the hint of danger in Cici's life, there's an added bit of romance between Cici and Jake as she tries to get him to treat her more like an adult, possibly even as a girlfriend, instead of the young brat he remembers from summers past. Overall, I thought \\"Twisted Summer\\" was a very good juvenile mystery. The ending wasn't too terribly surprising, but this is still a great summer read for preteen girls.	2002-12-07

But all of that changes when Mrs. Bridgeport's homely, lifeless niece (Wilma) comes to visit for a couple weeks and has a contagious effect on everyone. At first, you want to feel sorry for Wilma, but after a while of her lethargy, even the reader feels dulled by her. The one good thing about this book, though, is that it's short (128 pages). Yet it still took me a bit longer than I had expected to finish it. The ending isn't very satisfying either, but at least it's not too predictable.<br />This certainly isn't a book I'd recommend, but if you like short, quiet horror with more atmosphere (fog, dark rooms, nocturnal noises, a broken grandfather clock that only functions at night) than blood and violence, then you might like &quot;When Midnight Comes...&quot; by Carol Beach York.	2002-12-02

While there, Elizabeth stumbles into a magical realm as she searches for her missing sister in Fairy Tale Land, starting with King Abelard's Castle. In this medieval kingdom, Liz befriends and helps Princess Charity, whose family has been captured by the evil King Nestor, who also captured Jessica. He later passes Jess off, though, to the Queen of Drudgery and her sorceress ally, Grisolda; both of whom keep her as a slave.<br />Liz follows her sister's trail, meeting various talking animals (Allegra, a mouse; and Sidney the sea serpent), visiting an underwater Atlantis, and even running into popular Sweet Valley rock star, Johnny Buck. Yet this fantasy adventure wouldn't be complete without a few other literary/fairy tale characters thrown in, like Tom Sawyer, Rapunzel, Thumbelina, Hansel and Gretel, Peter Pan, and even the white rabbit from \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" (which this book mimics somewhat in the \\"tripping\\", out-of-body sense).<br />\\"The Class Trip\\" (the first Super Edition in the Sweet Valley Twins series) is one of my favorite guilty pleasures from childhood. Even my younger sister, who doesn't like Sweet Valley books at all, reread this one just as many times as I did when were kids. Ideal for preteen girls and SV fans.	2002-12-01

Although \\"Baby-sitter's Nightmare Part II\\" is a sequel, the previous characters don't reappear in this story, nor is the setting the same. Instead, it takes place in Silverdale, New Mexico, where a killer has decided to target eight female baby-sitters as his/her victims. After several attempts on the 16-year-old protagonist's life (and the murder of her best friend, Amy Holland), Karin Conner begins to suspect the killer is someone she knows very well, possibly one of her close friends.<br />The killer's motive (which is given away completely in the synopsis on the back cover) is a tad bit silly, I thought, and the tagline (\\"All baby-sitters must die.\\") got a slight snicker out of me. But, thankfully, this book doesn't repeat the same storyline as the first, since a lot of other juvenile suspense series do this, with the main character and killer doing the same things over and over, when you would think both would have learned something by about the second or third book.<br />It's not necessary to read both books to understand either one, since \\"Baby-sitter's Nightmare\\" and this book have separate plots, but if you like young adult thrillers, then I'd recommend reading both, though I prefer the first book over this one.	2002-11-30

Once released from the hospital, Joanna returns to her home where David died, hoping her memories will give her a clue as to who his killer was. But with the remembering comes the painful memories of her childhood (being sexually abused by her three older brothers), as well as the awful realization that one of her two childhood friends--Charlotte Dean, who is also her neighbor and possibly David's ex-lover; and Michael Lamb, who is now her fiancee--may be the killer.<br />Overall, I thought \\"I'll Love You Till I Die\\" was a great romantic mystery, though it was slightly confusing and disorderly at the end. One good thing is that I was wrong about the killer. It's somewhat difficult to figure him/her out, even after reading the book and reflecting on the clues.	2002-11-25

(Ha! Who hasn't noticed? :) All of her daydreaming is commented on by some of her teachers and her parents in \\"Bad Girl\\", due to her missing Oracle meetings and her dropping grades. For most teenagers, bad grades and skipping classes are typical, but Liz isn't like her irresponsible peers, so her erratic behavior is noticed a lot more than if, say, her twin sister Jessica were doing it. Anyway, to make a long story short, Liz gets in trouble with her parents because of this and is grounded. But will she abide by their rules--or continue being her un-Liz-like self by rebelling at the end of \\"Bad Girl\\"? (It's surprising the book ends the way it does in regard to Conner and Liz, meaning Liz was starting to turn into Conner's mom, which I thought would have repulsed him rather than turning him on. I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens between these two in the next book, \\"All About Love\\".)<br />And speaking of Conner, he and Gary (his ex-stepfather) are obviously still going at it. And, to no surprise, Gary breaks Megan's heart by announcing that he has a fiancee (a much younger woman) and wants to move her in to the house (which, if Gary hadn't noticed, isn't even his house; he's just \\"baby-sitting\\" Conner and Megan while their mother is in rehab). Megan, of course, is devastated by this announcement, because she thought her father and mother would eventually get back together. Clearly, they won't be any time soon, so Meg runs away, unable to cope with her unstable family life.<br />On a slightly lighter note, Ken Matthews is trying to switch his \\"good buddy\\" relationship with Maria Slater into something more romantic by inviting her out on covert dates. Maria, however, doesn't realize that's what he's doing until the last half of \\"Bad Girl\\", where their friendship appears to be on the rocks. You'll just have toread this book to see what eventually happens. All I'll give you in a way of a clue is a quote from Liz's diary: \\"Finally! Finally, finally, finally! Finally!\\"	2002-11-19

Shortly after Dinah's announcement, Kendra and her younger sister (Lauren) move to Graham's atmospheric mansion hidden away in downtown Manhattan--quite the gothic setting smack in urban New York City, and just a stone's throw from their old apartment building.<br />Here Kendra encounters the entity that has been haunting her recently: Revell, a handsome, charismatic man who wants to manipulate her unknown telepathic powers. Apparently, she has been marked as Revell's since infancy with a birthmark on her hand. However, as Kendra gets to know Revell better and uncovers some of her new family's secrets, she realizes Revell's motives are entirely sinister. But if she doesn't assist him, her family and friends will be in danger, though accidents start to happen to them anyway (including murder), partly the result of Kendra's out-of-control telepathy and partly Revell's doing.<br />In a way, this book reminded me of a similar teen thriller: \\"Dream Date\\" by Sinclair Smith, which also involves a seductive entity that haunts a young woman. Worth looking into if you like young adult supernatural horror stories. And if you enjoyed \\"The Temptation\\", then don't miss the following two books in the Midnight Series trilogy: \\"The Thrill\\" (#2) and \\"The Fury\\" (#3).	2002-11-18

While there, Kate is pushed to her limit by Tommy Langwald (aka \\"Fangwald\\", the instructor and owner of the estate), who not only gives Kate a hard time (though he is just as hard on some of his other students), but uses his crop on her horse, Night Owl, at one point in the story. This final action causes Kate to reconsider whether or not she wants to remain at Langwald's, despite her longtime dream of being an Olympic equesterian.<br />In addition to her problems with Langwald, Kate has to deal with Trevor Williams, one of her classmates who has a crush on her. Kate feels something for him in return, but she also has a boyfriend back in Connecticut. Will Kate remain loyal to Pete (her boyfriend), or will her newfound feelings for Trevor override that relationship?<br />The one part of the book I began to have my doubts about was concerning Casey O'Connell, another of Langwald's students, who begins to develop an eating disorder halfway into the book. While this story line could have turned into a poor example for young girls by showing that starvation is the only way to make you happier and more likable, the author thankfully avoided this mistake by creating a more acceptable resolve to Casey's overindulgence.<br />Overall, I thought \\"Kate's Challenge\\" was a great book for preteen girls. This series is also ideal for horse lovers. There's a glossary in the back of the book (which is customary in all Blue Ribbon books) with equestrian terminology, something I'd recommend more novice readers peruse beforehand if you're unfamiliar with horses; otherwise, you might find yourself flipping back and forth through the book.	2002-11-17

As the hours and days pass with no sign of rescue, Jessie begins to contemplate which will find her first: death or madness?<br />I had started this book a couple years ago, then set it aside because it was rather dull. Luckily, I had left off just prior to Jessie's \\"ingenious\\" plot to escape her bonds and was able to finish the remaining 100 pages or so in a day and a half. As warning, though, don't eat while you're reading this part. I made that mistake and was a bit nauseated afterwards and found myself absentmindedly massaging my own right hand.<br />At times, \\"Gerald's Game\\" is quite gruesome and descriptive (particularly the climax)--as only King can do it--but it's also rather boring. I thought it would have made a better short story, rather than a 445-paged book. There's not a whole lot of action, mostly just Jessie's internal struggle with her past. From any other writer, I probably wouldn't have rated this story as high, but I really enjoy King's writing, and Jessie's creative ideas for freedom made this book a bit redeemable. It certainly makes the reader wonder what s/he would have done in the same situation and might even make them think twice about bondage games.<br />In summary: this is not the best Stephen King horror novel I've read so far, and I would only recommend this book to diehard King fans, particularly those who enjoyed \\"Dolores Claiborne\\", since there some similarities between the two books: incest, women's issues, interweaving characters, and the solar eclipse of 1963.	2002-11-12

After somebody poisons his tea with digitoxin, Peaches believes her father is the next target of a con artist who swindles elderly people out of their money and then conceals their murder as a suicide. The suspects range from her young cousin's current and past boyfriends to a few of her father's round-the-clock nurses. With the help of Ted Holleran, Peaches' 64-year-old husband/sidekick, and a few other characters from the previous book (\\"Who Killed What's-Her-Name?\\")--such as \\"Mustache\\" (aka Lieutenant John Wilson) who helped solve the previous murder case--, Peaches hopes to uncover the serial killer's identity before s/he has a chance to kill again.<br />Overall, I thought \\"Remember the Alibi\\" was quite good, except for the continuous mention of Peaches' memory book, the one she's in the process of writing: \\"How to Survive Without a Memory\\". That slowed the book's pace a bit, though some of the memory tricks were interesting. Still, I thought Peaches was a wonderful female detective--witty, resourceful, and intelligent--even though she was a bit forgetful. I'd certainly recommend this book/series to anyone who likes mysteries solved by quirky, older amateur sleuths.	2002-11-11

L. Stine book I ever read. Strangely, I never read any of his books when I was a kid. I suppose even then I couldn't tolerate them. They were too simplistic to the point of \\"dumbing down\\" the reader. But being the horror fan that I am, I decided to buy some of his books in bulk (all at clearance price, thank god) a year or so ago and began reading them.<br />It only took me about a day to read \\"The Stepsister,\\" which is the typical reading time of a Stine book. That's at least one nice thing about his books--they're quick. Unfortunately, they also read like they've been written in a day. There's very little detail, almost no character development, repetitive actions and story lines, etc. Because of this, I'm surprised his books are so popular. You would think most younger readers would tire of the same cookie-cutter stories. Granted, there are a couple books I like by Stine (namely The Fear Street Saga trilogy), but \\"The Stepsister\\" is not one of them.<br />The book, in summary, is about 16-year-old Emily Casey who begins to have her doubts about her new stepsister's (Jessie Wallner) sanity when she finds out about her \\"serious emotional problems\\" via Emily's older sister, Nancy. Soon Jessie's annoying habit of \\"borrowing\\" Emily's clothes and deleting her social studies homework on the computer don't seem as important as having a psychotic killer in the house.<br />Yet it's not until somebody puts peroxide in Emily's shampoo (wouldn't she have smelled the chemical beforehand?) and kills her dog that Emily begins to strongly suspicion Jessie. The final indication comes after Emily reads her stepsister's diary and discovers Jessie had been involved in a fatal accident. Did Jessie really kill her best friend? Or had it just been an accident? And would the same thing happen to Emily?<br />To be fair, \\"The Stepsister\\" does have a somewhat surprising ending--that is, if you make assumptions about the characters based on the title alone. However, as I mentioned before, the book reads like a cutout of Stine's other Fear Street books, and, once again, the killer's motive is absolutely ludicrous. But for those who did enjoy this book, then you might like the sequel as well.	2002-11-10

Magdala agrees, but at the same time, she can't help but wonder what exactly his intentions are.<br />Although I love Tanith Lee's writing, &quot;Electric Forest&quot; isn't my favorite book by her. Granted, it is short (approximately 150 pages), but the technical jargon in the pre-screening and post-screening chapters baffled me. These two beginning and ending sections weren't really necessary to the story, in my opinion, and only seemed to muddle the plot. Still, I would recommend this book to sci fi fans, for a quick read.	2002-11-06

After giving an oral report on whales, Linda Fischer (one of the more overweight students in Jill Brenner's fifth-grade class) earns the nickname \\"Blubber\\" and is constantly picked on by her classmates. The routine name-calling and bullying gradually escalate to violence, but by the end of the book, the roles of Linda and Jill (the protagonist) are unexpectedly reversed, and Jill soon finds herself ostracized by her peers and teased just as relentlessly as Linda had been.<br />Although Blubber isn't my favorite Judy Blume book, I'd still recommend it to 9 to 12-year-olds girls. It illustrates how heartless and cruel children can be, especially when they thoughtlessly give in to peer pressure like Jill did. Most people can relate to this story, whether they were the one being bullied in school or someone who just witnessed it. However, like many of Blume's books, \\"Blubber\\" is somewhat plotless, and there's very little resolve by the end. Still, I thought this book was realistic and a fine example of how picking on someone can backfire.	2002-10-31

However, Aunt Lily and her son, Cousin Dinky, live four houses away, which is quite a distance for Tinies (little creatures--approximately 4 - 6 inches tall--that vaguely resemble elves with tails). Nevertheless, Cousin Dinky pilots his mother in his glider plane to the Littles' residence, even though it's in the middle of the night and snowing. However, during the trip, Aunt Lily falls out of the plane and is captured by the reclusive Ground Tinies. A search party is formed to locate Aunt Lily, with the added help of a cat and skunk, who remarkably don't make a meal out of the Littles. But will they find her in time?<br />This was one of my favorite books (and cartoon series) when I was a kid. It was given to me by my grandmother when I was about eight-years-old. Not only are the black-and-white illustrations terrific, but the Littles are extremely resourceful and imaginative in this story, using most things people throw away as tools, decorations, etc. My only two complaints are that the book has a rather abrupt ending (or perhaps there's a page missing from my book; I have had it for about 15 years), and that it's a bit ...., though younger readers may not pick up on this. Still, \\"The Littles to the Rescue\\" is a fun adventure story for children age 7 - 10. Highly recommended.	2002-10-27

Seventeen-year-old Brenda Morgan hates her cousin, Halley Benson, because she's a manipulative boyfriend-stealer. So, out of spite, Brenda and her two friends (Traci Warner and Dina Smithers) work Halley into their writing assignment for class, using her as the murder victim. At first, it was a joke to knockoff Halley, but as \\"Halloween Night\\" progresses and Halley pushes all of Brenda's buttons, Brenda decides to make the story real by killing her cousin during her Halloween costume party (which, by the way, doesn't even commence until the final 20 pages). Meanwhile, Brenda starts receiving threatening messages, but who are they from? And what exactly is in store for her on Halloween night?<br />I had considered giving this book a \\"3\\" because it was short (185 pages), but the ending was just abysmal, not to mention the rest of the book, which was slow and pointless. As usual, Stine relies too heavily on teen angst and a bunch of cliched gimmicks he uses so often they've become predictable (cliffhangers at the end of every chapter, invariable methods of attack and response, and \\"unlikely\\" suspects--who are really quite obvious if you're familiar with Stine's writing). Unless you're a Stine fan, I'd skip this [bad], overly dramatic attempt at teen horror. But if you did like it, then you might like the sequel as well.	2002-10-26

Unexplainably, she finds herself falling for him, even though she already has a steady boyfriend. Not long after they start dating, McKenzie starts having psychic visions about Michael that reveal his secret identity--he's a vampire. Even though the reader already knows this from the beginning (the title's a dead giveaway), McKenzie and her best friend, Lilith Caine, repeatedly question who he really is. Besides being somewhat patronizing to the reader, \\"The Vampire's Kiss\\" is also a bit musty concerning the vampire myth (i.e., nocturnal activity, some blood drinking, though the book is more atmospheric than violent). This isn't the best vampire story I've read, but fans of this series will probably like it. Plus it's short and fast-paced (144 pages), which will appeal to preteens who like paranormal horror but don't want to read very much.	2002-10-25

In the last story (\\"Broken Angel\\"), Conner's alcoholic mom was in an accident and received a DWI. Now, as part of her punishment from the judge, she's forced to go to a rehab clinic in Minnesota for one month, leaving Conner and Megan in the care of Gary, Conner's former stepfather and Megan's biological father. That situation has its ups and downs. For starters, Megan's thrilled her father's back in her life after all these years, but Conner doesn't trust him an inch and constantly argues with the guy. But that's Conner's typical charm. He's never one to actually trust or get along with other people.<br />As for the Wakefield twins and their family, they're moving out of the Fowler's mansion. (Yay! I thought it was a little too weird having the Fowlers and Wakefields living together.) Their house was finally rebuilt after the destructive earthquake that demolished several homes and buildings in the finalized Sweet Valley High series. Jessica is still confused over her feelings for Will Simmons--and occasionally for Jeremy Aames, who seems to have dropped out of the picture entirely. And Liz is still mooning over Conner like a lovesick cow. No change there. (Yawn.)<br />Meanwhile, Angel Desmond is looking for a way to financially make it at Stanford University. He's applying for a Resident Assistant position there, which is the only way he can attend the college. Besides that bit of pressure, there's the possibility he may have to leave earlier if he is accepted, which puts a strain on his relationship with Tia, who doesn't really want him to go. She's afraid he'll leave her for a college woman, so she considers losing her virginity to him (which, in my opinion, is one of the worst possible reasons to have sex). I was actually very surprised to find out Angel and Tia weren't sexually active; after all, they've been together for months (or is it years? I don't remember.) Anyway, most guys wouldn't last a month or two, let alone a year or more. I guess I had just assumed they were already doing not, but I guess not.<br />\\"Take Me On\\" is one of the many compulsively-readable books in this series. Conner, apparently, has more family skeletons in his closet by the phone call he overhears of Gary's and the legal documents he finds in his mother's bedroom; Jess is falling in love all over again--but with the wrong guy (imo); and Angel is on his way to becoming a Stanford freshman. I can't wait to start the next book in this series: \\"Bad Girl\\".	2002-10-23

The book begins shortly thereafter, before Christmastime, with Sara and her family having just moved across town and into a house with a troubled past. Here 11-year-old Shelley Graves' spirit awakens to haunt her family and manipulate young Sara to do her bidding, which includes seeking revenge against their abusive, alcoholic parents and comatose grandmother. The plans against Jane and Elliot Graves I could understand (after all, they were horrible, worthless parents), but the mental torture done to the old woman was uncalled for. I'm still not sure why Shelley/Sara wanted to hurt her.<br />Domestic violence, incest, and child abuse do come into play a lot in this novel, which is obvious by the dedication and opening quote alone: \\"For the children of violence and abuse, the survivors and especially those who did not . . . Sorrow's song for you\\" and \\"Every child has the right to protection and . . . to a life free from violence, exploitation, and abuse\\", from The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Children in 1989. However, very little seems to be done throughout the book to save Sara; she is a constant punching bag by her hotheaded father, and her tragic ending is no major surprise. So, don't expect a lot of vindication by the end of this book.<br />At first, I thought \\"Dark Lullaby\\" was interesting--or at least the idea for it was, but then I'm a sucker for pretty much any kind of horror story, especially ones where the heroine shares my first name--; however, this book really dragged nearly from the beginning. It took me a couple of months to get halfway through it, and then another few to pick it up again and finish it. For the most part, it was uneventful, tedious, and not very scary at all. There's not much meat to it either, and I've pretty much forgotten most of what happened just a few days after reading it. In summary: I wouldn't recommend this novel unless you're really into supernatural horror novels.	2002-10-21

As is typical in this genre, these animals are once again the monsters who must be destroyed, this time by a military team and about a handful of stereotypical gun-toting men: Klin (a renowned fisherman on Hayman Island), Professor Clifford Davenport (who apparently had a run-in with these crabs four years ago in the previous book, \\"Night of the Crabs\\"), Shannon (the chief shark-patrol officer on the island), and Harvey Logan (an egotistical professional hunter intent on keeping one of the crabs as a trophy). I don't think I have to tell you what happens to a lot of these crab by the end, but don't assume they become extinct. After all, there are four additional books in this series: \\"Origin of the Crabs\\", \\"Crabs on the Rampage\\", \\"Crabs' Moon\\", and \\"The Human Sacrifice\\".<br />By the title alone, I expected \\"Killer Crabs\\" to be extremely cheesy, like a lot of other horror novels published in the 70s and 80s that involved some type of killer creature. However, it wasn't as trashy as I had expected. Sure, there's plenty of graphic violence and sex (especially some nasty dismembering scenes), but it's all essential to the plot and really quite entertaining and suspenseful once you get into it, especially near the end when three of the main characters are stranded on the crab's spawning ground with no way off the island.<br />Another plus to \\"Killer Crabs\\" is that it's very short--just under 170 pages. Even though this book/series is definitely geared toward guys, female fans of horror (speaking as one) should probably enjoy it as well. My only complaint is about some of the main characters, such as Klin (an unsympathetic loner who is also a borderline racist) and Caroline du Brunner (an extremely promiscuous con artist). Still, \\"Killer Crabs\\" is a lot of fun and ideal for horror fans.	2002-10-10

But now, almost a year later, these four young adults are being threatened by someone who knows it was them who killed young David Gregg. Now that person is seeking revenge, targeting each one for death.<br />Although the 1997 movie adaptation of \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" is quite bloody, don't except the same from the book. There is very little violence in the book. And even the time setting is different (it takes place in the 1970s, during the Vietnam War). In some aspects, the movie is better, especially if you're just looking for a good scare. But if you're looking for a fair teen mystery, then you might like the book instead.<br />Even though I saw the movie first, there were still parts in the book that were suspenseful. For starters, the killer is different in both versions--the movie and book. However, after watching the movie, the reader will have a better idea of who s/he is in the book, whereas the reader who hasn't watched the movie will be a lot more surprised. His/her identity is hidden very well until the very end.<br />At times, \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" (the book) was very good and fast-paced, but the characters were entirely unsympathetic. I wasn't attached to them at all and figured if they shared the same fate as some of the characters in the movie, then that was fine by me. I also didn't find the writing all that great. It was rather dry and mechanical. But if you're a Lois Duncan fan, then you might like this book. Or if you're curious about the book that was loosely adapted into a movie, then it's worth a try.	2002-10-09

Even though George Stark began as a fictitious disguise, he has gradually become very real, turning into a cold-blooded killer and leaving a trail of blood and guts in his wake as he tracks down Thad and his family in Castle Rock, Maine. And as the death rate goes up, so does the suspicion surrounding Thad as being the one who committed these murders (after all, both men have the same fingerprints, and George isn't even acknowledged as being real yet) and very little seems to separate Thad and his family from being George's next victims.<br />\\"The Dark Half\\" is a relatively fast-paced horror story. I was able to finish it within a week and a half, unlike some King books I've read that take me a good month or more to finish, i.e., \\"It\\" (and I'm still working on \\"The Stand\\"). The similarities between Thad's situation and King's own writing career (his disclosure of writing as Richard Bachman) makes \\"The Dark Half\\" a great deal more eerie. After reading this book, I'd recommend watching the 1993 movie starring Timothy Hutton. I saw it beforehand, but it didn't ruin the suspense for me. The book and movie are somewhat the same plotwise.	2002-10-07

Instead, Michael procrastinates for the entire school year before starting his investigation again on graduation day. That was probably the least convincing thing about \\"The Graduation\\". Michael always seemed like a highly intelligent and motivated guy, but for reasons all his own he decided to take a break from Alice's mysterious death.<br />Following their graduation ceremony at Tabb High, the main dozen or so characters in this trilogy have a chance to say their final farewells to each other, as well as celebrate like idiots on their senior cruise trip to Catalina aboard the Haven, which should have been christened the Titanic (hint, hint). Here the truth of what really happened that night at the party will be revealed. Unfortunately, the identity of the killer wasn't a big surprise to me. In fact, it was kind of disappointing since s/he had been acting suspiciously from the get go. But at least most of the romantic relationships end on a good note for a change, especially pertaining to the two main characters (Michael and Jessica).<br />Although Final Friends isn't my favorite series by Christopher Pike, it's still worth reading if you like teen murder mysteries--and especially if you have the time and patience to tackle this long-winded trilogy. If not, you might try some of Pike's other single mysteries, such as \\"Fall into Darkness\\", \\"Die Softly\\", or \\"Last Act\\", just to name a few.	2002-10-05

Now she and her mother are leaving New York City for Langley, Texas, so her mother can remarry. Katie instantly dislikes rural life (she was born a \\"city girl\\"), and she uses the red notebook her friendly old neighbor (Mrs. Leitstein) from NYC gave her to express her feelings of being different (she's Jewish, as well as the new kid at school), being ignored by her mother for her stepfather, and then finding out her mother is expecting a baby.<br />Although \\"The Private Notebook of Katie Roberts, Age 11\\" occurs in the late 1940s, it seemed more contemporary than a period piece. In fact, if WWII or Joe DiMaggio hadn't been mentioned, I would have thought this was a present-day story, especially since some of the illustrations don't appear six-decades old.<br />Still, this is an ideal book for younger readers (9 - 12), particularly girls, who don't like to read very much. It's full of illustrations on practically every page and contains short, simple journal entries. It's also just 75 pages.<br />Also recommended: \\"Love You, Soldier\\" (first book in this series) and \\"The Great Green Notebook of Katie Roberts, Who Just Turned 12 on Monday\\" (book #3).	2002-10-02

Yet his unsettled past won't allow them to pursue a relationship at once. For starters, his ex-wife (Eleni Mavrakis) has mysteriously vanished, and Zach is the number one suspect. Not only that, but he's thought to have killed her. Although his memory of their last meeting is muddled (he had been drugged and then hit over the head), Zach knows he's innocent, and he's determined to prove it.<br />During their investigation, Abby falls for Zach even more (the feelings are mutual), though her attraction to him had begun long before this mishap. (She had tended to him at the beginning of \\"In Her Lover's Eyes\\" when he had arrived at the hospital she worked at. This beginning part was a little rough, though, namely with the 10-day time lapse at the hospital.) Yet their romance is put on hold again because someone doesn't want them interfering in Eleni's disappearance, hence the harassing phone calls in the middle of the night, the fire set in Zach's garage, and the reckless tailgater who tries to run them off the road. By the end of \\"In Her Lover's Eyes\\", Abby and Zach both needed helmets after receiving so many blows to the head. I got a headache just from thinking about it.<br />In summary: I thought this was a somewhat predictable mystery (most readers will be able to guess the truth behind Eleni's disappearance before the end), but for those who like a bit of romantic thrills set in beautiful British Columbia, then \\"In Her Lover's Eyes\\" is worth a go.	2002-09-29

Albeit the characters are interesting (i.e., my favorite: Bubba, the audacious, raunchy sex fiend, who is just as hilarious as ever, especially when he spikes a Pepsi with the cocaine a narc had used to try and set up Nick, as well as when he makes a sex contract with Sara), not all of them seemed necessary. On more than one occasion, I confused a few of the characters with each other, i.e., Sara and Polly, and Bill and Russ. Probably just shows how much my mind wanders while I'm reading, though.<br />Anyway, with the mass introduction of characters in the previous book, I should have realized \\"The Party\\" was setting the pace for the following two books, displaying everyday high school life foremost and hinting at a bit of suspense and mystery that never shows itself until the final dozen or so pages, which is what happens in this book with the crowning of the homecoming queen, who is the next intended victim.<br />Although \\"The Dance\\" is a pretty good book (great writing, especially the dialogue), I thought this story line would have been better as a single book, not three. Thus, I would only recommend this trilogy to diehard Christopher Pike fans with a long attention span. Other readers may not have the patience for this long-drawn-out teen murder mystery.	2002-09-25

This story has an alternate ending. 2.) \\"The Walk\\" - two men walking down the same road at night fear each other. 3.) \\"What Do You Come For?\\" - a lonely old woman wishes for company. 4.) \\"Me Tie Dough-ty Walker!\\" - a boy and his singing dog spend the night in a haunted house. (I really didn't understand this one.) 5.) A poem about \\"A Man Who Live in Leeds\\". \\"Some say this rhyme doesn't mean anything\\"--and they're right. 6.) \\"Old Woman All Skin and Bone\\" - a song with music notes about an old woman, a preacher, and the topic of death. 7.) \\"The Thing\\" - two friends are approached by a skeleton being, which results in one of their deaths a short time later. 8.) \\"Cold As Clay\\" - a farmer tries to keep his daughter away from her boyfriend, yet they can't be separated, even by death. This has a good creepy ending and is one of my favorite stories in this book. 9.) \\"The White Wolf\\" - a prosperous wolf hunter searches for an elusive white wolf. 10.) \\"The Haunted House\\" - a preacher tries to put a young woman's ghost to rest by seeking her killer. 11.) \\"The Guests\\" - a husband and wife spend the night in a house that doesn't exist. 12.) \\"The Hearse Song\\" - a [upset] song (with music notes) about the process of decomposition (\\"the worms crawl in, the worms crawl out\\"). 13.) \\"The Girl Who Stood On a Grave\\" - as a bet, a young girl must find a grave to stand on and then place a knife in the earth--only she never leaves the graveyard. 14.) \\"A New Horse\\" - a witch turns a farm hand into a horse, except her spell backfires on her in the end. 15.) \\"Alligators\\" - a woman fears her husband and two sons are turning into alligators. 16.) \\"Room For One More\\" - a man is approached by a stranger who drives a hearse. 17.) \\"The Wendigo\\" - a hunter and his Indian guide travel into the woods, but only one survives the fatal trip. 18.) \\"The Dead Man's Brains\\" - this one is not a story, so much as an idea for Halloween: use various ingredients (such as a peeled tomato and grapes, cooked spaghetti noodles, etc.) to represent a dead man's body parts. 19.) \\"May I Carry Your Basket?\\" - a young boy offers to carry an old woman's basket, unaware of what's inside. 20.) \\"The Hook\\" - a popular tale of a prison escapee with a hook for a hand and a young couple out on a date. 21.) \\"The White Satin Evening Gown\\" - a young woman attends her last formal dance when she rents a beautiful dress with a deadly past. 22.) \\"High Beams\\" - another popular story; this one is about a young woman who is tailgated by an erratic driver. 23.) \\"The Babysitter\\" - a baby-sitter receives several anonymous phone calls from a killer in the upstairs room of the house. 24.) \\"The Viper\\" - similar to the previous story, a widow receives a few phone calls from a man with a speech impediment. 25.) \\"The Attic\\" - a man searches for his dog in the attic of his house. 26.) \\"The Slithery-Dee\\" - a short poem about a sea creature that eats everyone but \\"me\\". 27.) \\"Aaron Kelly's Bones\\" - a dead man returns from the grave, ruining his wife's chance at marrying again. 28.) \\"Wait till Martin Comes\\" - a man seeks shelter in a house that is occupied by a couple of suspicious cats. 29.) \\"The Ghost With the Bloody Fingers\\" - a funny finale about a musician, a ghost, and some much-needed Band-Aids.<br />There's not a lot of conflict or plot in some of these stories, but most of them serve their purpose: to [upset] out and scare kids (age 9 and up). Although the stories alone aren't entirely terrifying, the creepy, dripping illustrations by Stephen Gammell do the trick. \\"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\\" is ideal to be told in a group, but these stories are fine to be read alone, but preferably in the dark. Also recommended: \\"More Scary Stories to tell in the Dark\\" and \\"Scary Stories 3: More Tales to Chill Your Bones\\" by the same author.	2002-09-23

While 15-year-old Molly Witherspoon's mother is away on business in Japan for three months, Molly and her four sisters (Lizzie, Emma, Ralph, and Clementine) are left to run the house on their own, with the occasional supervision from their absentminded father. During this time, Molly is busy working on her Today's Family class presentation. She intends to film her siblings in their everyday lives, hoping to shed some light on her misunderstood family, especially since one of her sisters (Emma, the eccentric 16-year-old who is interested in the occult) is the laughingstock at their high school. In addition to that, Molly has accepted a bet with Candy Carlisle (her arch rival since the second grade), that whomever gets a lower grade on their class presentation has to publicly praise the other's work. Yet this last matter isn't entirely wrapped up by the end of the book. (...)<br />On occasion, the Witherspoon family is chaotic and weird, but, surprisingly, Molly and her four sisters get along very well. They're like the mirror image of the March sisters in Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\". In that respect, they are quite unusual. Still, \\"Molly and the Great American Family\\" is a heartwarming story of family/sister bonds, and their ability to solve everyday problems together is exemplary. This is a decent book for preteen and older girls, especially ones that can relate to the Witherspoon household.	2002-09-22

There are, on average, 11 pages per month to write on, containing a quote on each page from various Judy Blume books, such as \\"Tiger Eyes\\", \\"Forever...\\", and \\"Deenie\\". There are also a couple dozen black-and-white photographs of young adults, all of which is meant to inspire the writer. By the end, there are a few pages for you to reminisce on how you've grown/matured over the year and what you expect to accomplish in the next year. There is also a place for addresses, phone numbers, important dates, and even a calendar, but only for the years 1986-8 (in the 1985 British version published by Piccolo).<br />(...)<br />Even though I don't intend to use this book as a diary, it's still great to have if you're a diehard Judy Blume fan (which I am). Another good book that benefits children (as well as parents) is her nonfiction book, \\"Letters to Judy: What Kids Wish They Could Tell You\\", which I highly recommend.	2002-09-22

(The master is on the left; the beginner is on the right.) Although the bear drawings are cute and unique, I found some of the positions slightly more confusing and inaccurate by using the illustrations rather than human subjects. It was hard to tell what goes where (especially on the Triangle and Sitting Twist exercises), but at least there's a descriptive paragraph on every other page that tries to clarify the yoga position.<br />There's also additional information in this tiny book (which, by the way, is easy to take with you almost anywhere), such as a recommended reading list, a brief intro to yoga (including the Sanskrit names of each exercise), hints and advice, and some useful addresses and telephone numbers for finding a yoga class (though they may be out of date by now).<br />&quot;Yoga for Bears&quot; was given to me by my sister a couple years ago when she had gotten over her yoga craze. Although I've only used it once or twice (I'm not really into yoga), I'd still recommend this book to beginners, particularly ones who love bears; after all, these furry creatures detail the entire book. However, I'd still follow the bit of advice on page 14 if you're serious about approaching yoga properly: &quot;find a good teacher and go to a regular class.&quot; You may run the risk of injuring yourself by practicing alone.	2002-09-22

(What is wrong with that guy's father?) Now Angel isn't even sure he can go to Stanford, no matter how hard he works at his other job at the Riot.<br />Meanwhile, Jeremy Aames breaks up with Jessica Wakefield, thinking it best for them to spend some time apart, especially after he caught Jess on what looked like a date with Will Simmons in the previous book, \\"The One That Got Away\\". It's now left up to Jessica to figure out who she wants to be with--Jeremy or Will. And it doesn't look like it'll be an easy decision for her either, especially after reading her \\"Jeremy vs. Will\\" comparison list on page 60 and 61--and especially after what happens in the last few pages of this book during the cheerleader-football team \\"kidnapping\\".<br />And speaking of writing samples, there are two humorous bits in \\"Broken Angel\\": 1) on page 122, the morning announcement Maria Slater has to read to the school about showing school spirit the \\"responsible and mature\\" way, and 2) on page 133-6, Andy Marsden's slacker essay for the Oracle on school spirit. There are additional notes and journal entries (which is standard in every SVH Senior Year book), including some e-mails passed between Maria and Ken, who, surprisingly, have not yet gotten together, if they ever will. But at least Ken's still determined to get back on the football team, the one thing (besides the memory of his dead girlfriend) that brings him a great deal of happiness.	2002-09-20

(Besides, the entire back cover and several inside pages are just devoted to reviews, leaving no room for a synopsis.) Even though it's been a long time since I've read this book, I still love it. Anna Quindlen is an absolute master (or is it mistress?) at writing. She creates such a touching and unforgettable story about a 24-year-old New Yorker (Ellen Gulden) who returns home to unknowingly take care of her 46-year-old mother who is dying of cancer. The relationships Ellen has with her family are quite captivating (particularly the one she has with her mother) and, at times, even mysterious, which is the case with her father, a man Ellen is always trying to impress.<br />Categorically, \\"One True Thing\\" is mainstream literature, but there's an undercurrent of mystery and suspense regarding the events of her mother's sudden death, leading the reader to believe someone in the family was involved in euthanasia--or possibly murder. The ending will certainly surprise you.<br />I highly recommend this book. The 1998 movie that was made, however, is not nearly as good as the book, even though it had some great actresses and actors (Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger, William Hurt, and Tom Everett Scott). In my opinion, the movie didn't capture Quindlen's storytelling, nor did it do the book any justice. So, in summary: definitely read the book, but rent the movie afterwards only if you're a fan of one of the actors or actresses.	2002-09-19

While Heidi recovers in the pediatric ward, Cindy gets acquainted with some of the other young patients and even volunteers in an upcoming variety show with two others girls: Tina Wu, a lupus patient at HH, and Veronica Langley, the new girl at Hope Middle School who Cindy is jealous of. Cindy believes Veronica \\"stole\\" Cindy's best friend, Trevor Wayne, away from her (a guy Cindy would rather have as a boyfriend), but, as the three girls get to know each other better, Cindy realizes she may have jumped to conclusions about Veronica and finds herself possibly wanting to be friends.<br />Although everything seems to be headed in an upbeat direction, the events in \\"Get Well Soon, Little Sister\\" suddenly turn tragic when one of the younger cancer patients unexpectedly dies, causing Cindy to struggle with her own memories of death and loss when her mother had died of throat cancer four years ago. This is a realistic and touching book, and most girls age 8 to 12 who are interested in hospital settings will really enjoy this series.	2002-09-18

Martin's popular The Baby-sitters Club series) contains quite a bit of useful information for the young baby-sitter just starting out. The first 28 pages list numerous ideas and pointers on how to successfully care for children, including several ways to entertain them with games, jokes, suggested reading material, and even a few recipes. There is also advice on how to deal with emergencies (everything from nightmares to injuries), as well as tips on how to get them to go to bed on time. Probably the best recommendation is to create a \\"kid kit\\" to bring with you, an idea that was used frequently in the BSC series. Your kit can include toys, games, crayons, musical instruments--you name it. Kids love new things to play with, and it'll probably entertain them for hours, depending on what you bring. You may want to vary your kit, though, on repeat visits.<br />The last half of \\"The Baby-sitters Club Notebook\\" is intended to be used as a record book/diary for you to place all the important information for each client, such as their names, address, telephone numbers, etc. If you baby-sit a lot, then you may need a second journal.<br />This is a great resource for young baby-sitters, especially for fans of the BSC series. Even if you've been baby-sitting for awhile, this is still a great refresher on how to do it right. Ideal for preteens.	2002-09-17

The estate was left in her name when her grandfather's will was read in the previous book, revealing that he was, in fact, her biological father.<br />Yet Dawn isn't the only one to be lied to about her birth. Clara Sue, Dawn's younger sister, soon discovers another secret kept by both girl's mother: that Randolph Cutler isn't Clara Sue's father either; Bronson Alcott is. In fact, just two months after Randolph dies (which happens during Dawn and Jimmy's honeymoon), Dawn's mother and Bronson intend to marry. All of this is quite a shock, especially for Clara Sue, and she takes it out on Dawn one day by attacking her and causing her to miscarry.<br />Despite the constant barrage of problems from her dysfunctional family, Dawn tries to take more control of her life and create a new, more stable environment for herself by, first, tracking down her newborn baby, Christie, who had been stolen and adopted shortly after being born in secret at the Meadows. Next Dawn marries Jimmy, who has remained loyal and devoted to her ever since they were children, even after both of her ill-fated relationships with Philip Cutler (her half-brother, who is still obsessed with her) and Michael Sutton (her vocal instructor, who pays her a visit later on). Yet I wouldn't consider Dawn's marrying Jimmy the most \\"normal\\" decision she's ever made. It's still slightly incestuous, even though Jimmy is a great guy.<br />Additional past characters revisit Dawn (and a few more die) over the course of years this book covers, such as her estranged \\"father\\" (Daddy Longchamp, the one who had \\"kidnapped\\" her) and his new family. Even Fern Longchamp (Dawn baby \\"sister\\") makes an unforgettable appearance at the end. Sadly, \\"Twilight's Child\\" is the last book told from Dawn's viewpoint, for tragedy strikes again in the following book, \\"Midnight Whispers\\", which is the story of Dawn's 16-year-old daughter, Christie Longchamp. The Cutler family series concludes with the fifth installment, \\"Darkest Hour\\".	2002-09-15

In the meantime, she's visited by an unusual stalker who expertly breaks into her Queens apartment at night. Oddly, he never hurts her, only wants to talk with her, all the while hidden in the dark behind a ski mask. His identity is never revealed until the final chapter, though. It's a bit of a wait, but I'd advise you not to read the ending beforehand like I did.<br />Later on, Johanna meets a handsome man, Matthew Lang, a 45-year-old psychological suspense novelist, while checking out one of his books in a local bookstore. From there, they have an ideal relationship with plenty of love and sex to appeal to any romance fan. Shortly after, he invites her to his Maine chalet during the wintertime to be his inspiration, his mythical Muse. However, once they arrive, he becomes a totally different person, turning into this brooding, eccentric alcoholic who must have his privacy at all costs.<br />This is about where the book starts to lose its edge. Scenes are played over again in the cabin: she becomes suspicious and confronts him, he gets defensive and angry, they later make up (which, curiously, never leads to sex), and the trend repeats itself a few pages later.<br />The climax, as well, is a bit disappointing, skipping through about a half dozen weak plot twists, until finally settling with a pretty good warped ending. But probably the biggest fault with this novel is how easy it is to identify the killer nearly from the beginning. Don't read the synopsis on the back cover if you can help it, because it reveals more than it should.<br />Despite all that, I still thought \\"Muse\\" was pretty good. I really enjoyed Cecilione's writing style, even though the book was a bit on the lengthy side (480 pages). But it's worth a try if you're into psychological suspense novels.	2002-09-05

However, on the way back home, they accidentally hit and kill a man crossing the street. The foursome try and keep it a secret, but too many odd things start to happen shortly after: the corpse of the man they killed is reported missing from the morgue, the four young teens start receiving threatening phone calls from the deceased man (Brandt Tinkers), as well as other signs to indicate the man isn't dead after all--or is he? Could this whole stunt really just be a sick joke?<br />\\"Hit and Run\\" loosely follows the path of Lois Duncan's \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\", except there's not as much bloodshed in this book as compared to the movie (which is surprising, since this is a Stine book), except for another hit-and-run targeting Winks. As is typical with any R. L. Stine book, the writing's spare and short, and there's a cliffhanger at the end of every chapter. The identity of the killer is pretty easy to guess as well (at least it was for me), and I'm sure most readers familiar with Stine's work will guess him/her nearly from the beginning. There is some morbid, juvenile humor (i.e., at the beginning with the human eye prank and at the end when they're playing around with a stiff), but I think the intended audience will probably enjoy it rather than be disgusted.	2002-09-03

But who is he? Her burly new carpenter, Matthias Quinn? Her old college professor, Dr. Hadley Alcorn? Or her family's young attorney, Ian Renfrow? The identity of Charlotte's secret admirer is pretty obvious, especially since the author gives his name away in the foreword note of this book, but \\"Secrets of the Heart\\" is still a sweet,[and]gratifying, story.<br />In the second tale, \\"Two Hearts\\", Pansy Kingsmith, a plump, sensible Wisconsinite, still has feelings for her ex, Jesse Angelini (who also happens to be her next-door neighbor), even though he dumped her after three dates. She visits a love potion shop in the hopes of magically seducing Jesse--but, instead, she accidentally attracts his twin brother, Peter. Pansy is a more realistic heroine, even though she is, at times, very desperate--and a Peeping Tom to boot.<br />The third and last story, \\"Heart's Desire\\", is set on a Caribbean cruise ship. Here Angie \\"Angelique\\" Dubonnet, a vacationing nursery-school teacher from Michigan, hopes to grab the attention of a handsome, mysterious stranger (Nikolas Dorian) by masquerading as a rich tourist with one mission in mind: to have \\"five days and nights of hot, fabulous sex\\" with this Greek millionaire. \\"Heart's Desire\\" is definitely an \\"erotic valentine voyage\\", even though the ending is kind of left up in the air for anything to happen.<br />\\"Black Velvet Valentines\\" is the third book in Ms. Alexander's Black Velvet Temptations series. The previous two books are \\"Black Velvet\\" (#689) and \\"A Touch of Black Velvet\\" (#704). If you like hot romance with a touch of humor, then you'll probably enjoy this Harlequin Temptation/Blaze addition.	2002-09-02

This setup is contrived by a serial killer, Frank Bollinger (aka the Butcher), who is after a clairvoyant ex-mountaineer, Graham Harris, and his live-in girlfriend, Connie Davis. For the duration of the night, these two must try and escape the Butcher's strategic deathtrap before he finds them first.<br />Granted, &quot;The Face of Fear&quot; isn't as complex and serious as some of Koontz's more recent novels, but this is still a fun read for suspense fans. You might even want to watch the TV movie that was made in the early 90s if you enjoyed this book.	2002-09-01

He rarely gets to play because of his size, and his teammates aren't very sympathetic towards him. But in the last important game of the season, he's called in as a replacement, in which he finally gets to use his small size to his advantage.<br />Just like how Harold used other short baseball players in the Baseball Hall of Fame as role models, other young readers (age 4 - 8) can read this story and find encouragement in its lesson: that size doesn't matter; it's how you play the game that counts.	2002-08-27

While she's in New York, she's visited by various family members, some she'd rather not have around (such as her two siblings, Philip and Clara Sue), and some she can't seem to live without (Jimmy Longchamp). Even so, Dawn's tie to Jimmy doesn't remain very strong when she meets Michael Sutton, her handsome singing instructor. Michael becomes Dawn's first real lover, which results in her getting pregnant, only Michael wants nothing to do with the child and abandons them for London.<br />Helpless and confused, Dawn allows Grandmother Cutler to take charge of her life. Dawn is therefore sent to The Meadows, a dilapidated, old family plantation in Virginia, to have her baby in secret, under the \\"care\\" of her grandmother's two sisters (Miss Emily, a bible-thumping, religious freak, and Charlotte, a simple-minded old woman). Yet again, Dawn is victimized by her family, forced to work like a mule, even during her late months of pregnancy, and forced to endure constant verbal and emotional abuse. This last section of the book was a little offbeat, which is why I gave \\"Secrets of the Morning\\" a \\"4\\" instead of a \\"5\\". The Cutler family series isn't my favorite V. C. Andrews series either, but \\"Secrets of the Morning\\" is a pretty good follow-up to \\"Dawn\\". The remaining three books in this series are \\"Twilight's Child\\" (#3), \\"Midnight Whispers\\" (#4), and \\"Darkest Hour\\" (#5).	2002-08-24

Christensen, \\"Islands in the Sky\\" by Tanith Lee is the first book in this children's fantasy series created by Mr. Christensen. Other notable fantasy writers have also collaborated, including Terri Windling and Ellen Steiber (#2: \\"The Raven Queen\\"), Sherwood Smith (#3: \\"Journey to Otherwhere\\"), Will Shetterly (#4: \\"Thor's Hammer\\"), and Mary Frances Zambreno (#5: \\"Fire Bird\\"). All of these books are worth reading if you enjoy children's fantasy fiction.<br />In \\"Islands of the Sky\\", 10-year-old orphaned Hope Glover has grown up a scullery maid in 19th century London, until she's magically taken away by a kite caught in a tree. Unknowingly, her master's spoiled son, Apollo Rivers, also tags along. Hope soon enters the world of the Basset, a flying ship occupied by dwarves and gremlins, and befriends the kind first mate, Sebastian, as well was an inept genie she finds in the sea. In this magical world full of mythical Greek creatures, she aides in the war against the cruel centaurs who intend to enslave all the wingless horses, animals the centaurs believe are far inferior to them since they only have one quality while the centaurs have two (being part human and horse). And while Hope assists Pegasus and his fellow winged and wingless horses, Apollo soon falls to the side of the enemies and is consequently imprisoned by Klatter in Centaur City.<br />\\"Islands in the Sky\\" is a wonderful story. Older Tanith Lee fans will love it, as will young fantasy/adventure readers. Recommended for children age 9 - 12, but suitable for adults as well.	2002-08-18

The two editors (Joel Myerson and Daniel Shealy) briefly talk about Louisa's literary accomplishments in the afterward of this book, remarking on what a rare find &quot;The Inheritance&quot; is, as well as it being a steppingstone in her writing career. It is notable since it is her first novel, but I wouldn't consider it her best work. However, I've only read one other book by Miss Alcott: &quot;A Long Fatal Love Chase&quot;. That one I liked much better, because it was more adventurous and suspenseful than &quot;The Inheritance&quot;, even though it still followed the same romantic path.<br />This sentimental 19th century romance novel is set in the rich English countryside. It follows the Hamilton family (the stoical mother: Lady Hamilton; the obedient son: Arthur; the naive 16-year-old daughter: Amy; and the envious cousin: Lady Ida) and Lord Percy, a friend of Arthur's, as they all fawn over beautiful Edith Avelon, an orphaned Italian young woman who had been brought to England from Italy when she was ten. Ever since, Edith has been a playmate and governess for Amy, but recently she's become the love interest of Lord Percy, to Lady Ida's dismay. Already devoted to the Hamiltons, Edith will soon learn of a secret that will further bind her to the family.<br />Probably the most unappealing thing about this book is Edith. She's so nauseatingly good, she seems unreal; she could have been a nun. She's extremely loyal to everybody, even her enemies (Lady Ida, for instance); she's kindhearted toward the sick and elderly; she's a beautiful singer; she's incredibly attractive, self-denying, gentle, pure... Gag. The one good feature about this book, though, is its brevity; it's just under200 pages. It's worth a try if you're a Louisa May Alcott fan or really into 19th century romantic literature.	2002-08-14

At the beginning of the school year at Cresswell High, 10th-grader Lisa Enright and her boyfriend (Skip Masters) join the debating team--she as the recording secretary, and he as the replacement for one of the debate members. Not long after joining, though, Skip is murdered during a hazing prank. With the help of one of the group's leading speakers (Donna Forsi), Lisa tries to uncover the truth about her boyfriend's death.<br />\\"Resolved: You're Dead\\" isn't the best book I've read by Nicholas Adams, but at least it's short (153 pages). About three-fourths of the way into the book, though, the identity of the killer is revealed, leaving very little suspense after that. Most readers will be able to guess the ending, too. But if you like Nicholas Adams and/or the Horror High series, then you might like this book. R. L. Stine fans will probably like Horror High, as well.	2002-08-11

The Fabulous Five, along with some extra help from their friends, hope to raise $375 in the next two weeks, before Christmas Eve, when 15 older cats and dogs will be euthanized, because there's not enough room at the local animal shelter for them. But will Melanie Edwards and her friends raise enough money in time? And if so, can they find homes for all of the cats and dogs? Because, otherwise, the shelter won't allow the animals to be released.<br />I liked the moral of this story since I love animals and have rescued a few from the pound. Other young readers (9 - 12) will probably enjoy \\"The Christmas Countdown\\" as well, especially if they're animal lovers. This is one of the better books in this series.	2002-08-10

First up: Jessica, who discovered her secret admirer was Will Simmons in the previous book (#8: \\"Maria Who?\\"), has decided not to tell her boyfriend (Jeremy Aames) anything about it yet, which causes problems later on when he does find out via Melissa Fox. (Melissa definitely lives up to her last name again in this book; she's extremely sneaky and manipulative. I can't wait to see what else she's up to in the following stories.)<br />Next up: Ken appears to be finally coming out of his shell (caused by the death of his girlfriend, Olivia, in the big Sweet Valley earthquake awhile back). The reason for his attitude change? Maria Slater. Looks like these two will be pairing off pretty soon--that is, if Ken can completely get over Olivia first.<br />And lastly: Poor--and I use the word intentionally--Angel is developing a bad betting habit at the horse track. His whole college career could be riding on his careless spending.<br />\\"The One That Got Away\\" pretty much ends on a bum note for everyone. Hopefully, a few of the characters will find some hope and resolve in the next book: #10, \\"Broken Angel\\".	2002-08-09

Soon after their arrival, a deadly swarm of insects is released upon the town by a local lunatic (Carl Henderson). These bugs travel among living things (animals, humans), feeding and multiplying inside their host until it dies. Then the swarm moves on, repeating the process.<br />Although the killer insect theme definitely falls into the horror genre, I wouldn't really group &quot;The Homing&quot; with those other cheesy, one-dimensional stories about bloodthirsty vermin that, without any apparent reason, start attacking humans. John Saul writes a little more intelligently than that. &quot;The Homing&quot; is more horror-ish than his other books, though, but it's still worth a try if you're a Saul fan--that is, if you don't mind the creepy crawlies that come with it.	2002-08-07

Like the Shakespearean play the title of this book is cited from, there is a forbidden love that blossoms against the Gothic Toronto setting. The Juliet character is an 11th-century vampire named Bianka, born into darkness by two different makers, one is Toreador and the other Brujah. She's come to Toronto with her pet raven (Ravena)--to the Box, to be more exact, a small section in the city where a stubborn group of Camarilla are confined by the Sabbat, a ruthless bunch of bloodsuckers. Bianka's purpose is to help free the imprisoned Kindred from the Sabbat's hold, but her mission is conflicted when she falls for the enemy (Lot).<br />While having some knowledge about The Masquerade storytelling game is useful, it's not really necessary. There are some terms that may be confusing, but a lot of it is self-explanatory, and most people shouldn't have any trouble reading this book. It happens to be one of my all-time favorite vampire novels, and I highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in vampire fiction. Pretty much anything published by White Wolf is worth checking out as well.	2002-08-06

The book starts on a Wednesday and edges slowly toward Saturday, the day in which the world will end. It's up to two angels--well, one angel (Aziraphale, who is also a part-time book dealer) and one demon (Crowley, \\"who did not so much Fall as Saunter Vaguely Downwards\\")--to try and sway the 11-year-old Antichrist (Adam Young) to one respective side--either Heaven's or Hell's.<br />There are so many characters and mini plots in this book, it's hard to get attached to just one, but my favorite would have to be Witchfinder Sergeant Shadwell. He was an absolute kook and, at times, very funny. The rest of the book is amusing and entertaining at parts, but it wasn't as funny as I had expected. Probably the two humorous bits that do come to mind are the author biographies and the caveat on one of the first few pages: \\"Kids! Bringing about Armageddon can be dangerous. Do not attempt it in your own home.\\"<br />\\"Good Omens\\" was also, in my opinion, too long and verbose and could have had 100 pages or so removed and still have served its purpose. This isn't a book I'd necessarily recommend, but if you're an avid fan of one or both of the writers, then you might like this sci fi spoof on the Apocalypse. And for those who did enjoy the book, you'll be happy to know \\"Good Omens\\" is being made into a movie sometime next year.	2002-08-05

To do this, Victoria begs her parents to allow her to work as a mother's helper during the summer on Fire Island in New York, the same vacation spot as Jim. Imagine that. :) However, Victoria never expected Jim's beautiful girlfriend, Gloria Donovan, to show up with him, or to have Jim's good friend Barry to fall for her instead, or to be stuck with two very spoiled demon spawns, who's mother hardly pays Victoria anything.<br />In addition to the laughs, this book is very realistic by involving such things as drug use, nudity (the scene where Victoria enters a nude beach for the first time is priceless--\\"wow, look at all those penises!\\"), profanity, etc., matters that are rarely placed in teen fiction, even though they're commonplace things in most kids' lives. In that sense, this book kind of reminded me of Judy Blume's writing (another good writer to check out).<br />I thought the ending was great as well, and I highly recommend \\"My First Love...\\" to preteen and older girls, especially Francine Pascal fans who want to read how she really writes.	2002-08-03

Freedman and her Jewish family (consisting of her parents; grandmother, Ma Fanny; and brother, Douglas) move to Miami Beach, Florida, from New Jersey because of her older brother's poor health. Here Sally's imagination runs wild--she believes one of her neighbors, Mr. Zavodsky, is really Adolf Hitler in disguise. She even creates numerous short stories in her head, including one where she confronts Hitler himself, as well as one in which she saves a distant relative named Lila from a grim fate in Dachau.<br />Being separated from her father, who she calls Doey-Bird, also makes it more difficult for Sally to adjust in Florida. Yet he tries to make time for her, even though he remains in New Jersey to work. Eventually, Sally does make friends with a few of her classmates and even fantasizes about dating her own \\"Latin lover\\", Peter Hornstein, who is in her class.<br />\\"Starring Sally J. Freedman As Herself\\" was one of the first books I ever read by Judy Blume, sometime in middle school I believe. It also happens to be one of my favorites by her. I reread this one constantly, so much that I had to purchase a second copy to replace my first. Highly recommended and ideal for girls 9 to 12-years-old.	2002-08-03

C. Andrews' third series (the Cutler family series). A lot of her stories deal with the rags-to-riches theme, and in \\"Dawn\\", the leading 14-year-old character (Dawn Longchamp) learns that her current impoverished family (which consists of an older brother, Jimmy, a baby sister, Fern, and parents) is not really her own. Dawn is really the daughter of a wealthy family in Richmond, Virginia, who own and operate a prestigious hotel on the coast named Cutler's Cove Hotel. As if that weren't shocking enough, Dawn soon discovers that two of her classmates (Clara Sue and Philip) at Emerson Peabody School are really her siblings--and Philip also happens to be Dawn's boyfriend. The chances of that actually happening are about a million to one, but the taboo of incest is in all of V. C. Andrews' books, whether it's plausible or not.<br />Following the revealed secrets, comes the emotional, psychological, and sexual abuse. Dawn is returned to her \\"rightful\\" family, and she is immediately disliked by her sister Clara Sue, as well as her matriarchal grandmother. Philip, on the other hand, refuses to allow their relation to get in the way of his scoring with her. In the background are Dawn's biological parents, both of whom are pretty delinquent and submit under Grandmother Cutler's command. The only security Dawn has comes from her other \\"brother\\" Jimmy, who later expresses his years of restrained feelings for her, which she reciprocates. (Jeez, if it's not one brother, it's the next.)<br />Even though this book (and series) is pretty good, it's not the most original storyline in the world, nor is Dawn Longchamp-Cutler the greatest heroine I've ever read in a V. C. Andrews book. The ghostwriter (Andrew Neiderman) relies too much on the redundant family drama Ms. Andrews outlined before she died; you can pretty much deduce the surprises laying ahead for the character. Nevertheless, I stillfind myself drawn to these books. No matter how bad your family life may be (speaking within reason), you can always read a V. C. Andrews book and say, \\"I'm glad I'm not in her shoes.\\"<br />After \\"Dawn\\" comes \\"Secrets of the Morning\\", \\"Twilight's Child\\", \\"Midnight Whispers\\", and \\"Darkest Hour\\". Recommended for V. C. Andrews fans.	2002-07-30

(Sweet Valley High Senior Year No. 8)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	8th Book in the SVH: Senior Year Series	Following the dramatic Elizabeth-Conner scene in the previous book (#7: \\"Boy Meets Girl\\"), Elizabeth Wakefield is back at the Fowler's mansion after discovering Conner McDermott's mother is an alcoholic, and Conner refuses to discuss it with anyone--especially Liz. Not everything is sour for Liz, though, in this book. Maria Slater makes the first bold move of patching things up with her concerning the boy trouble they had over Conner. It's great to finally see these two friends again.<br />And speaking of Maria, she's asked to star in the school play, \\"Courting Priscilla\\", alongside Jessica Wakefield and Tia Ramirez. However, Maria's stardom is starting to go to her head, and her two new friends may not have enough patience to put up with it, not that I blame them.<br />There is some added excitement in this eighth book. It looks like Jessica has a secret admirer who's been giving her expensive gifts and poetry--and it's not her boyfriend, Jeremy Aames. (Hint: The mystery man has been interested in Jessica before. But watch out for the red herring.)<br />Another notable mention: Angel Desmond, Tia's longtime older boyfriend, makes his \\"main character\\" debut in \\"Maria Who?\\". He's recently taken a second job as a bartender at the local hangout (the Riot) to Tia Ramirez's dismay, because not only does it keep him from her, but Angel's boss is extremely strict and won't allow him to converse with any of his friends while he's working. Besides his hectic schedule, the biggest problem I saw was Tia's unnecessary pressure on Angel. I mean, why does she expect him to pay for everything? Why doesn't she get a part-time job and help out with their dates, especially with their big anniversary coming up?<br />Aside from that, \\"Maria Who?\\" was pretty good, although it didn't really spotlight the \\"Nina issue\\" like the synopsis on the back cover described.<br />Changing the subject: If you like SVH: Senior Year books, then there's another teen romance series you might want to check out: Love Stories. I haven't read any of them yet, but I've heard they're pretty good.	2002-07-27

After waking up from years of dormancy, Stacy is still unclear about the events, but she's determined to identify the killer, despite the harassing phone calls and a nocturnal prowler outside her home. But will she be able to recognize the killer before he decides to return and finish what he'd started?<br />Because \\"The Other Side of Dark\\" had received so many awards and positive reviews (including the Edgar Allan Poe Award), I had expected this book to be topnotch. However, it wasn't as exciting or suspenseful as I had hoped. For starters, the entire book was told in the present tense, which sort of threw me. And for being only 185 pages long, it wasn't very fast-paced. In fact, it took me about a week to finish this one.

It begins on Laura Palmer's 12th birthday and documents most of the important events in her short life, up to a few days before her murder and the disappearance of this diary. Although \\"The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer\\" is very provocative (after all, how many young girls have 40 lovers before they turn 15, are constantly abused by an unknown entity named BOB, and also struggle with a cocaine addiction?), I wasn't entirely shocked. I had watched the series first, as well as the movie (\\"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me\\"), before reading this book (which I highly recommend other readers do as well; otherwise, you might be a little lost), so I pretty much knew what to expect from Laura. However, I never did feel any closer to her after reading her diary, probably because there were giant time lapses between entries, and the book didn't even read like a diary at times. Still, I highly recommend this book to \\"Twin Peaks\\" fans who are interested in Laura Palmer's past. And even if you've never watched the series, you might want to give this one a try and \\"discover the nightmare version of daddy's little girl\\". After reading this, you'll definitely want to watch the series and movie again. You might even catch some clues you didn't see before.	2002-07-14

All this drama finally cumulates on the night of Polly and Alice McCoy's party, when one of their peers commits suicide--or, at least, it appears to have been self-inflicted. The unsolved homicide/suicide mystery continues with the following two books: \\"The Dance\\" (#2) and \\"The Graduation\\" (#3).<br />\\"The Party\\" does stretch for quite a bit without any major action, just character development and backstories. In fact, the suicidal party scene doesn't even occur until the last 60 pages of the book, and then quickly speeds by. I'm aware this is a trilogy, so the pace will be a bit slower, but it was a tad boring. Well, maybe not entirely boring, but I just expected more to happen than first dates and football games.<br />On a good note, though, Pike's writing style is just as great as ever--funny and dramatic at parts (Bubba is definitely the comedy relief here. He's a bit crude, but still very amusing.)--, but this book is not as scary or suspenseful as some of his other books (\\"Fall into Darkness\\" is one that comes to mind). I still intend to read the other two books in this trilogy, though. Recommended to Pike fans, as well as teen mystery readers.	2002-07-08

He sends Copper to unwilling, mean relatives who in turn pass her on to other reluctant relatives. Eventually, Copper ends up with her odd Aunt Maggie Jones who practices witchcraft and teaches Copper how to be honest and take control of her life by first confronting her own nightmares.<br />This was a very enjoyable and fast-paced book. The ending was a little elusive, hanging with the question of what Copper would do in a certain situation, but overall it was terrific. Highly recommended to preteen girls who can relate to Copper's situation of being alone and unwanted by family, yet finding strength from them as well.	2002-07-06

For starters, Jeremy Aames finally asks Jessica Wakefield out on a few dates after their first kiss in the previous book. However, their dates never seem to go as planned, and they both begin to have their doubts about whether or not they should continue seeing each other. Plus, there's that added tension with Will Simmons showing up on one of their nights out. His appearance would seem harmless (after all, Jess swears she's over him), but if you read on, you'll see why it's not.<br />Next up is Melissa Fox, who is hospitalized after trying to kill herself in book #6, right after Will Simmons broke up with her. Most everybody feels guilty about this incident, especially Jess and Will, yet that's not stopping either one of them from thinking about each other. Could there still be some possible chemistry between these two? (I hope not. Jess seems happy enough with Jeremy, without Will ruining things.)<br />And lastly: Maria Slater had caught Elizabeth Wakefield and Conner McDermott kissing, and now she's not speaking to either one of them, mostly Liz though. And not surprisingly, Conner is now avoiding Liz, too, so she can \\"work things out\\" with Maria. More like so he can leave the \\"relationship\\" quietly.<br />There were some really good lists, journal entries, and assignments in \\"Boy Meets Girl\\", in particular Liz's freestyle writing assignment about the meaning of love and Maria's \\"Why Books Are Better Than People\\" list (my favorite). This is probably one of the better books I've read so far in this series. Jessica is finally back to her old self, worrying about boys and appearances, plus being more assertive, which was the biggest character trait missing in the previous six SVHSY books. \\"Boy Meets Girl\\" is worth reading if you finally want to see Melissa get her comeuppance and Jessica land on her two feet again.

Eight Hoover High seniors (Shani Tucker, one of the main characters; Park Jacomini, another protagonist; Kerry Ladd, Angie Houston, Sol Celaya, Lena Carlton, Bert Billings, and Flynn Powers) all make plans to travel down the California coast to Mexico and spend the weekend in Lena and her sister's large family vacation home. Residing in the mansion is Robin Carlton, once an active teenager and their close friend, but now a shut-in. She is slowly dying from permanent kidney damage that resulted from her \\"accidentally\\" ingesting a large amount of insecticide at a party one year ago. And, to this day, someone hasn't forgotten the incident, because soon all nine teens are stranded in the house when their transportation is destroyed in an explosion--which kills one of the teen's inside the van--and the phone lines are cut.<br />Everyone seems to have a secret about that night at the party, including Flynn (aka Michael Ryan Richardson), who wasn't even there but has shady motives for tagging along with the group in Mexico. For me, it was pretty easy to guess Flynn's real identity, but I won't give anything away. It's worth finding out on your own. One drawback to the book (in my opinion) was the shaman's story about Snake, Eagle, Dove, and Raven, which was a bit unnecessary and silly, though it did foreshadow events scheduled to happen later on in the book.<br />Although \\"Weekend\\" isn't my favorite Pike book, it is one of the more memorable books I've read by him, particularly because of the Mexican setting (\\"Don't drink the water!\\") and the beginning scene where Lena is trimming cacti in a bikini, of all things. It's definitely worth reading if you're into Scholastic YA Thrillers, and especially if you're a Christopher Pike fan.	2002-07-02

Recently, 17-year-old Alice Fleming's hometown (Anslow, Colorado) has been the target of numerous, random burglaries--and soon Alice becomes the leading suspect when the victims are identified as baby-sitting clients of hers. Things become even worse for her, though, when Alice's baby-sitting replacement (Nancy Ettinger) is murdered during a break-in. Now, not only is Alice thought to be a thief and liar, but also a killer. Alice knows she's innocent, but what can she do to convince everyone else otherwise? And can she do it before the burglar decides to visit her next?<br />\\"Baby-sitter's Nightmare\\" was a pretty good young adult thriller, even though I thought some of the suspicion went a bit overboard. I mean, I can see how maybe her friends or the detective would doubt Alice, but her parents--that was slightly unbelievable. Most parents will defend their children, guilty of a crime or not. Anyway, if you liked this book, then don't miss the sequel: \\"Baby-sitter's Nightmare II\\", which follows another teen's baby-sitting terror. Recommended for girls age 12 and up.	2002-06-29

Instead, it follows the various love problems brewing among the other Chatham Island teens. For starters, Zoey Passmore was found making out with Aaron Mendel in \\"Nina Shapes Up\\" (#10) while she was still dating Lucas Cabral (major déjà vu here; remember her cheating on Jake McRoyan at the beginning of this series in \\"Zoey Fools Around\\"?). Next is Aisha Gray and Christopher Shupe. He's recently proposed to Aisha and has been pressuring her to give him a yes or no answer before he ships out in January. (He's in the army.) Personally, I don't think they should marry, but we'll see.<br />And, although Benjamin had been debating for the past couple of books whether or not to proceed with the experimental laser surgery that may or may not restore his sight, the actual operation doesn't start until the end of this book. Major disappointment! From what I assumed from the synopsis on the back of this book, it should have occurred within the first dozen or so pages. Perhaps the result of his operation will be in the succeeding book, \\"Claire Can't Lose\\" (#12). I hope. (fingers crossed)<br />So, overall, this was a pretty good book (thus my 5/5 rating). However, I was a little bummed Benjamin was rarely the star of this book. I would think something as important as regaining one's sight would entail a few more pages or chapters than what was allotted. Still, \\"Ben Takes a Chance\\" is worth reading if you're into the Making Out series.	2002-06-24

In \\"'D' is for Deadbeat\\", she's approached by Alvin Limardo (real name: John Daggett) who wants her to locate a 15-year-old boy named Tony Gahan and deliver a $25,000 check to him. Although she's wary of John, she proceeds with the case, only to have his $400 retainer check bounce--and his corpse wash up on the California shore a short time later.<br />After his death, John's estranged, successful daughter Barbara Daggett requests Kinsey to pursue the situation. Both women don't believe his death was an accident, especially now that Kinsey has learned more about his past--that he had just been released from prison for doing a few months' time for vehicular manslaughter, which killed the above-mentioned teen's family. Now Kinsey must sort through a handful of possible suspects who were all too happy Daggett passed away, including one of his wives (Lovella Daggett) and one of Tony Gahan's guardians (Ramona Westfall).<br />I thought \\"'D' is for Deadbeat\\" was a really good mystery, even though I had guessed the killer about halfway into it. I doubt most people will guess him/her right away, though; it is a bit of an unexpected twist.<br />Like a lot of Grafton's books, there's always a sudden, wild ending, and this one is no exception. So, if you're a Sue Grafton fan, then I'd certainly recommend this book.	2002-06-21

He's perplexed by her moodiness, and, when she suddenly disappears, Michael becomes obsessed with her and his various memories of her.<br />Seven years later, as a law student, Michael is reunited with Hanna; however, not on the best terms. She is on trial with a handful of other SS female guards, all of whom are being tried as war criminals in conjunction with the Nazi concentration camp atrocities during WWII. Although Michael is numb after seeing her again, he is troubled by his present dilemma to try and free her from a life sentence, or allow her to seal her own fate.<br />Once I began \\"The Reader\\", I couldn't put it down and finished it in one day. It was very captivating and well written. The translation from German to English was great, and I'm very pleased this book made it over to the States. If you enjoy brief May-December romantic literature, then I highly recommend \\"The Reader\\". It's a wonderful work of fiction. Also recommended: \\"The Lover\\" by Marguerite Duras.	2002-06-18

Jessica, for one, wants to join the snobby Unicorn Club, but Elizabeth doesn't. Liz thinks they're very superficial and mean (which they are), and her opinion of them proves right when they invite her to join, but only if she agrees to play a trick on Lois Waller, an overweight classmate. Liz would rather be a part of 'The Sweet Valley Sixers' (a new middle school newspaper) than be a member of the Unicorns, yet she doesn't want to mess up her twin sister's chance of joining either. How can Elizabeth be loyal to Jessica, yet also be true to herself at the same time? Will she go ahead with the prank or drop out of the club entirely?	2002-06-17

Unless Cassie wants her good friend Diana Meade to find out she's been fooling around with her boyfriend, Cassie must submit to Faye's diabolical scheme to become the leader of the coven, as well as her plan to uncover the dark powers of the crystal skull Adam finds on a remote island. When Faye and Cassie secretly use the skull in a private ceremony, they release something evil upon the small New England town--something that may be responsible for at least three deaths, possibly more by the end of the book.<br />After \\"The Captive\\", this series wraps up with the following book: \\"The Power\\" (#3), a must-read if you've finished the first two books--\\"The Initiation\\" (#1) and \\"The Captive\\" (#2). If you enjoy slightly romantic, occult teen thrillers, then I highly recommend you read The Secret Circle trilogy; you won't be disappointed. Anything else by L. J.

Not long after they arrive, strange things start to happen: Brandt's cat is killed by a flying spear (just curious--why do all pets have to die horribly in Stine's books?), someone or something is moving around at night in the attic, and Brandt finds Cally Frasier's diary, which is mysteriously still being written in.<br />Apart from the terror at home, Brandt is becoming very popular with the girls at Shadyside High, in particular with Abbie Ayler, Jinny Thompson, and Meg Morris. However, the ghost of Cally Frasier intends to harm everyone Brandt is close to, including the above-mentioned girls. What can Brandt do to protect everybody, including himself, from Cally's pent-up rage? (By the way, since when did Cally get so angry? Maybe it's because she's now part of the evil in the house, but it just seems so out of character. In the first book, she was rather nice.)<br />Like the first book in this trilogy, \\"The Second Horror\\" is just as bad, and I don't mean \\"bad\\" as in \\"good\\". The ending is unbearably awful, and the plot is just plain silly. So, unless you're a really loyal R. L. Stine fan, I'd skip this trilogy (\\"The First Horror\\", \\"The Second Horror\\", and \\"The Third Horror\\").	2002-06-11

Here the young housemaid is kept a slave in both literal and sexual terms by the owner's son Rupert, who enjoys involving Annie in his sadomasochist, drug-induced fantasies. As the story progresses, the house and all its surroundings gradually begin to transform into the landscape of India, a place that holds special significance to the inhabitants of the house.<br />Although \\"Elephantasm\\" isn't my favorite Tanith Lee book, I'd still recommend it if you're a fan of her horror/dark fantasy novels or just want to try something new. It's quite similar to a lot of her other books (\\"Heart-Beast\\" is one book that comes to mind), with the seemingly helpless heroine, the exotic atmosphere and surreal storyline.	2002-06-10

The only witness is recently widowed, 8½-months-pregnant Annie Sandusky, who spots a man running from the scene disguised as Santa Claus. Only moments after the incident, Paul's 30-year-old estranged son (Jake) mysteriously shows up at the ranch. He, along with his twin brother Nick and a handful of other loyal friends and neighbors, gather together to solve Paul's death and the many threats, poisonings, burglaries, and arsons that follow. During all the turmoil, the leading Tewa native (Jake) and the ever-so-womanly leading lady (Annie) somehow muster enough time and hormones to romp in the hay and pretty much act like giddy teenagers to satisfy any romance-hungry reader.<br />However, the main thing that didn't really seem believable in this book was Paul's clause in his will--that Annie, Jake, and Nick all live at Black Raven Ranch for one year before anyone could receive their inheritance. It was planned too perfectly for the two lovebirds (Annie and Jake) and wasn't really necessary in the plot.<br />Still, if you enjoy romantic intrigues, particularly involving interracial (Native American and Anglo) couples, then you'll more than likely enjoy this Harlequin Intrigue addition.	2002-06-08

They are continuously playing a cat-and-mouse game with their abusive father by packing up and moving whenever he leaves for work overseas; yet he always tracks them down when he returns to the States, and the cycle of abuse resumes from there.<br />When things finally get out of hand, Ben's mother considers it best if he and his older brother Ray go to a special school for troubled teens so his parents can \\"work things out\\". Although relationships in this family aren't too strong, this arrangement severs quite a few ties, particularly between Ben and his autistic younger brother Philip, who later faces a grim fate at the end of this book. Although Philip was pretty much a shadow throughout this book, he was one of my favorite characters. Another favorite was Julie Williams, one of a handful of oddly-placed characters that run in and out of Ben's life. She was abandoned by her father at a young age and consequently ended up at the school Ben's attending. Ever since she's been physically chasing men that resemble her father, yet she can never seem to catch up to them.<br />I thought this book gave a captivating, realistic look at domestic violence. However, even though it's apparently geared for young adults, I don't consider this book appropriate for most kids. For starters, the writing is a little hard to comprehend; even I had some difficulty following the plot--it switches back and forth sporadically between the past and present, making it quite confusing at times. Also, the content might be a little too disturbing or graphic for younger or more sensitive readers since it involves some physical and sexual abuse.<br />I did like that there weren't any chapters, just intervals. It was relatively easy to speed through that way. I was also surprised this book was written 30 years ago. It doesn't seem outdated at all. Sadly, though,the topic of child abuse will always be relevant, so I doubt this one will be placed on the shelf and forgotten.<br />Recommended for adults or more advanced teenage readers.	2002-06-07

That's why her four friends nominate her to run as president in the seventh grade class election; they're certain she'll be a shoe-in with her \\"connections\\". Christie is somewhat reluctant, though, but she doesn't want to disappoint anyone either. So, with the help of Jon Smith (the quiet seventh-grader Christie's been tutoring in math), Christie sets out to find a happy medium by creating a mystery candidate to run against her and prissy Melissa McConnell (part of The Fantastic Foursome, The Fabulous Five's arch rivals) in the upcoming class election.<br />I thought \\"The Popularity Trap\\" was a pretty good children's book... if you're into the Fab Five series, you'll probably like this third installment.

Instead, it's the prequel to the Casteel series. In it, 12-year-old Leigh VanVoreen (Annie's grandmother) tells her traumatic story of family secrets and abuse via the diary her father gives her on her 12th birthday, the same one Annie finds upstairs in Jillian's abandoned bedroom.<br />In \\"Leigh's Book\\", her first major shock occurs when her mother (Jillian) divorces Cleave (who Leigh had always considered her real father, but he's not) and remarries Tony Tatterton, a very young, rich proprietor of Tatterton Toys. Like many of the mothers portrayed in V. C. Andrews' books, Jillian is a very superficial, devious, self-centered woman. Probably one of the most treacherous things she does is manipulate her young daughter to be a \\"distraction\\" for Tony so he won't persist Jillian for sex, which Jillian believes drains her of her beauty.<br />Leigh and Tony's time spent together is hardly innocent, though, especially when Tony persuades Leigh to pose nude for him for his upcoming lifelike doll creation. Despite the sexual abuse from her stepfather, I think the worst betrayal is when Leigh confesses to Jillian what Tony's been doing to her--and her mother doesn't believe her. From there, Leigh is pretty much on her own and responsible for some major life-altering decisions no teenager should have to make. I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt a great deal of sympathy for Leigh considering everything she went through.<br />\\"Web of Dreams\\" makes a great conclusion to this series. After reading \\"Gates of Paradise\\", I was expecting \\"Web of Dreams\\" to be just as bad or even worse as its predecessor, but thankfully I was wrong. This is a terrific book and sheds some much-needed light on a very dysfunctional family and their secrets. \\"Web of Dreams\\" is definitely a not-to-missed V. C. Andrews book. And if you enjoyed this one, then don't miss the previous four books in this series: \\"Heaven\\" (#1), \\"Dark Angel\\" (#2), \\"Fallen Hearts\\" (#3), and \\"Gates of Paradise\\" (#4).	2002-06-01

My grandmother gave it to me when I was 9-years-old, and I read it so often after that, I would make tabulations on my bookmark of how many times I had read it per day.<br />Not only did I become a bookworm, but part of my love for animals came from this book. I mean, its hard not to get attached to Wilbur, the runt pig 8-year-old Fern Arable \\"save[s] from an untimely death\\", or Charlotte A. Cavatica, the clever, imaginative gray spider who fools everybody into believing Wilbur is a special pig by spinning flattering words about him in her web so hes not butchered, or even Templeton, the sarcastic, self-centered rat who is somewhat of a help later on.<br />One year after it was published, \\"Charlottes Web\\" was named a Newbery Honor book. During the 70s, it won the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal and was later made into a movie. Although its been several years since Ive seen the cartoon, I do remember that I really enjoyed it. Not more than the book, of course, but its worth checking out if you liked this story.<br />Recommended for readers age 8+.	2002-05-31

Eight years ago, Mariah Sullivan and her boss were accused of sexually molesting several of their day-care students. Shortly after the rumors started, one of their pupils (Dotty Orel) went missing, then was found murdered. Although Mariah was innocent of both molestation and murder charges, her boss was found guilty of child pornography and sentenced to prison. However, Dotty's killer was never found.<br />Now, eight years later in a new town, Mariah has started her own child day-care center called Tot Lot, far away from the old rumors and accusations. As the Tot Lot nears its one-year anniversary, it unexpectedly becomes the target of various grave threats: a child effigy is hung from the tree in the Tot Lot yard with a note (\\"Will this be your kid?\\") attached to it, someone breaks into the day care and leaves another message (\\"It's all going to happen again\\") in clay, and then someone writes \\"Tot Lot Kids Are Abused\\" on the window. But the most shocking event is when Mariah receives a child's shoe in the mail that belonged to the late Dotty Orel. Mariah then realizes her present tormentor is the same person who had murdered Dotty nearly a decade ago. And now Mariah must try and solve the identity of her stalker before s/he strikes again, because that person has already threatened to kill another child--perhaps Mariah's own 7-year-old daughter, Clarisse.<br />\\"Child's Cry\\" started out pretty good, but it was somewhat of a chore to finish. Usually I can read a 300-paged book in a few days, but this one took me a couple of weeks. There really wasn't a lot of action or suspense, and the identity of the stalker/killer was no big surprise; I had suspected them from the beginning. This isn't a book I'd recommend, but if you're really into suspense/mystery stories involving children exploitation, then you might like it. Otherwise, save your money.	2002-05-27

Three Hollander High seniors (Linnie, Ming, and Jackson) decide to get even with a bunch of their classmates who they consider cheaters and liars by publicly humiliating them in a secret prank called the Dead Game. At first, their hit list only contains two people--the transfer twins (Austin and Adler)--, but as the trio gets swept away in the thrill of the game, six more students are added to the list: Brenda, Karl DeBerg, John Stalley, Price, Rafe Gibbons, and Julie Clay.<br />Linnie, Ming, and Jackson's plans seem to be running smoothly--that is, until Rafe Gibbons accidentally ends up in intensive care and Brenda falls down a flight of stairs to her death. The threesome then decide to stop playing the Dead Game before anyone else gets hurt. However, the game doesn't end for them there. Following the accidents, the remaining people on their hit list mysteriously get their payback. But if Linnie, Ming, and Jackson didn't do it, then who did? And if someone else is involved, are they next on the hit list?<br />I thought \\"The Dead Game\\" was a pretty good, fast-paced teen thriller. The game idea for revenge was quite clever and original, although I was a little bummed about the identity of the killer. Still, worth reading if you enjoy Point Thrillers. Recommended for readers age 12 and up.	2002-05-22

However, the two characters are completely separate beings. While Lasher had been a devious, evil Taltos spirit that haunted the Mayfair family for generations, Ash is a more even-tempered, kinder flesh-and-blood Taltos that lives in Manhattan as a very rich doll-making entrepreneur. (Between the two, I still prefer Lasher because he was so wicked. ;)<br />For centuries, Ash has been alone, never encountering another of his kind, until news from his good friend, Samuel (one of the Little People in Donnelaith), has Ash traveling overseas to London in the hopes of finding another Taltos. While abroad, Ash roots out the corruption in the Talamasca and kills those who are guilty. Aaron Lightner's murder in this book is among the many occurrences that prove the Talamasca's fall. Because he was so loyal to the Mayfair family, despite his obligations to the Order, it was sad to see Aaron go.<br />During Ash's search, one of the Talamasca members (Stuart Gordon) claims to have a real Taltos and entices Ash to meet her (Tessa) for his own selfish reasons. However, Tessa is barren and cannot carry on the Taltos line; yet Ash is still hopeful in finding a mate. His persistence pays off when he eventually meets Rowan and Michael, who are attempting to avenge Aaron's death. Through their meeting, Ash unknowingly makes a connection with another Taltos, one that isn't born yet. Remember Mona from \\"Lasher\\"? Well, she has a big surprise for everyone: she's pregnant with a Taltos (Morrigan). But will Ash find her in time, or will Morrigan be murdered like Lasher and Emaleth, destroying Ash's chances of ever finding a mate and continuing the Taltos line?<br />Although \\"Taltos\\" detours from the Mayfair family, it's still a pretty good addition to this trilogy. It expands on the Taltos mythology and gives the reader more insight on this species than what Lasher could previously offer. However, I missed Lasher, the Mayfair witches, and New Orleans. The Taltos history is all well and good for background information, but I prefer the witchcraft, demons, and drama in \\"The Witching Hour\\". That's why I gave \\"Taltos\\" a 4 instead of a 5. If you've read the previous two books (\\"The Witching Hour\\" and \\"Lasher\\") and enjoyed them, then I'd recommend this book; otherwise, skip it.	2002-05-18

When he gets a gig at the House of Java (where Elizabeth Wakefield works part-time), Conner's good friend Tia Ramirez considers it her duty to help out by secretly promoting his gig, knowing full well he doesn't want all the attention, but believing it's in his best interest.<br />In the meantime, before his Friday night gig, Conner decides to break up with his current fling, Maria Slater, because he's starting to get irritated with her. And although Maria and Elizabeth are good friends, Elizabeth can't help but be excited that's he free again. But will she proceed with her feelings--or has she learned enough about Conner by how cruelly he broke up with Maria that all previous feelings she had for him have vanished?<br />And speaking of being dumped, poor Jessica Wakefield loses two of her supposed best friends (Lila Fowler and Amy Sutton) to Melissa Fox, the insecure basket case whose been spreading false rumors about Jessica ever since she found out that Jess and her boyfriend, Will Simmons, had been seeing each other behind her back. Jessica is later literally dumped on her butt during a cheerleading routine when her above mentioned ex-friends were supposed to catch her in a risky cheer. Things really don't look good for Jessica at all in this series, and her new attitude is a little too out-of-character. The Jessica from the old SVH books wouldn't have allowed Melissa to ruin her reputation this way; the old Jessica would have had a lot more backbone and told Melissa when and where to get off. So what happened?	2002-05-15

After being overseas for most of her life because her father is in the military, 14-year-old Cassandra &quot;Cassie&quot; Mason is finally returning to the U.S. to finish her remaining three years of high school in Arlington, Virginia, without interruption. Two months into the school year, Cassie meets another new student, Helen Holsinger, who soon becomes her best friend. However, Cassie's parents disapprove of Helen and believe she's a bad influence on Cassie when Cassie's grades start to drop, she starts avoiding old friends (like nerdy Susan Carpenter) that Helen doesn't like, and she skips school and makes rude outbursts during class. Cassie refuses to listen to her parents, though, and continues seeing Helen. But could her parents be right--could Helen just be a bad influence on her and getting her into more trouble than their friendship is worth?<br />I thought &quot;Real Friends&quot; was a pretty good book about adolescent friendships. However, I was a little confused about Cassie's real last name. In the synopsis it's Mason, but in other parts of the book she's called Winn. I suppose it's not very important, but that's the one thing that bugged me about this book--the inconsistencies.<br />Recommended for 12+ year-old girls.	2002-05-13

Hannah Deaton--along with 29 other Parker High students and 2 chaperoning teachers--is expecting the August train tour from Chicago to San Francisco to be a lot of fun. However, there's just one distraction--a coffin is being transported in the baggage compartment of the train, and inside is the body of Frederick Roger Drummond, aka Frog, the late troublemaker at Parker High who recently died in a fiery automobile accident.<br />Shortly after departure, some students are mysteriously attacked, including Hannah who is knocked unconscious and placed in Frog's empty coffin. But where was Frog's body if not in the coffin? Accordingly, Hannah starts to believe Frog isn't dead, that he's instead seeking revenge on Hannah and her friends for being so mean to him last year.<br />I thought \\"The Train\\" was an all right book, but it's not my favorite; it's more of a 4 or 4 1/2-rating than a 5. The train setting was great though since I love trains, and the book vaguely reminded me of the cheesy 1980 horror flick starring Jamie Lee Curtis called \\"Terror Train\\". However, some scenes were somewhat drawn-out, like the one with Hannah locked in the coffin; and sometimes the characters were thinking far too slowly for the reader or reacted too predictably. Still, if you're into Point horror books and like Diane Hoh, then you'll probably like \\"The Train\\". For readers age 12 and up.	2002-05-12

The first one, \\"Daisy's Valentine\\", is about a man named Joey who falls for his coworker, Daisy. \\"Daisy's Valentine\\" sets the pattern for most of Gaitskill's stories, all of which typically leave the reader a little confused and frustrated about the unresolved situations and abrupt endings in this book.<br />\\"A Romantic Weekend\\" is anything but. It starts as a planned S&M weekend between two somewhat strangers. However, it becomes a big disappointment for both parties when they realize that neither had the same fantasy, that they're ultimately incompatible.<br />\\"Something Nice\\", about a 59-year-old married man who falls for one of the prostitutes he meets at a brothel, is another pointless story with no major conflict or plot to satisfy me.<br />The remaining six short stories are as follows: \\"An Affair, Edited\\" -- a successful man reminisces about an old flame when he sees her a few times on the street; \\"Connection\\" -- two women become friends through a mutual ex-lover (In \\"Connection\\", the main character, Susan, reflects on how human relationships are \\"intense, inexplicable, and ultimately incomplete\\", which perfectly describes this book.); \\"Trying To Be\\" -- a prostitute becomes \\"friends\\" with one of her lawyer clients; \\"Secretary\\" -- a young secretary is sexually harassed by her lawyer boss (this one was later made into a movie that aired at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year and will be released in limited areas this September); \\"Other Factors\\" -- after being invited to a party, a woman recalls various relationships she's had with the other partygoers; and \\"Heaven\\" -- a middle-aged woman reminisces about her family and children. \\"Heaven\\" is probably one of the few decent stories in this book. By this time, I was used to Gaitskill's writing style and welcomed the randomness of it. Great ending to the book, by the way.<br />In a fewof the stories, however, it was hard to connect with the characters; they were generally either drug addicts or prostitutes--just scum of the Earth. However, I thought Gaitskill's writing was very good. I didn't like how the stories just dropped or seemed to go nowhere, but her style made the book worth reading. I'll probably never re-read this one, but I doubt I'll forget it entirely.	2002-05-12

Eighteen-year-old Melanie Martin is new to Careville, Iowa, and feels out of place at her new high school. All of that changes though when she is encouraged to tryout for a part in the school play (Final Chance) by the director, Susan Trels, and lands one of the leading roles. Part of her reason for joining though was because of Marc Hall, the brooding ex-football player she has a crush on and who seems to like her as well.<br />At first, everything seems to be working out for Melanie--that is, until opening night when one of the cast members is shot and killed on-stage, and Melanie becomes the prime suspect. For the remaining half of the book, Melanie tries to find out who the real killer is, as well as trying to find a link to an accident that happened almost one year ago involving several of the drama students. Because if she doesn't find out soon, she'll be tried--and more than likely convicted--as an adult for first-degree murder.<br />As with a lot of the Christopher Pike books I've read, I didn't want to set this book aside for anything, not even for sleep. \\"Last Act\\" was very engrossing and complex, and it was hard to guess the villain until close to the end because of the back story with Clyde. Another reason why I liked this book so much was because of Jeramie, the eccentric photographer/actor who mostly spoke in riddles. I absolutely fell in love with him from the beginning; he was just flat-out weird and had a wonderfully dry sense of humor that was rarely acknowledged.<br />In my opinion, \\"Last Act\\" is one Mr. Pike's best books and should definitely be read if you're a Pike fan or into teen mysteries.	2002-05-03

Like many of V. C. Andrews' heroines, Annie has one forbidden love--her half-brother, Luke Casteel, Jr--, who she misses terribly when she is sent to her grandfather's mansion (Farthinggale Manor) in Boston to recuperate. While she's there, Annie is not only mistreated by her nurse (Mrs. Broadfield), but by her delusional grandfather, Tony Tatterton, who mistakes her for Heaven and Leigh quite often. Because she's isolated from most of her family, Annie has no one to really turn to, except a mysterious older man who calls himself Timothy Brothers and lives in the cottage nearby.<br />\\"Gates of Paradise\\" is the only disappointing book in this series; the other four books--\\"Heaven\\" (#1), \\"Dark Angel\\" (#2), \\"Fallen Hearts\\" (#3), and \\"Web of Dreams\\" (#5)--are all terrific. I had a hard time liking Annie's character; she was too whiny and weak and nothing like her mother, Heaven, who was quite a fighter. Plus, the plot was a little dull with Annie confined to her room or her wheelchair. There weren't a lot of new secrets revealed either; most of them had been uncovered in the previous three books. So, what exactly was the point of this book?<br />Despite \\"Gates of Paradise\\", the Casteel series is still one of my favorite series by V. C. Andrews. And if you want to find out how all of this confusion and incest began, then don't miss the fifth and final book: \\"Web of Dreams\\".	2002-05-01

Following his brother's death, Tito and his family are forced to leave their home when the same gangbangers return to vandalize and tag their house. One of Tito's friends insists he should seek revenge for his brother's death and gives Tito a gun. But will Tito use it and give in to peer pressure just like his older brother did--or will he try to rise above the bloodshed and set things straight?<br />\\"Drive-By\\" is a simply-written, short book (only 85 pages) and ideal for young readers (age 10+) who don't like to read very much. Although it's quite sad--despite the somewhat pleasant ending--, there's certainly a lesson to be learned about dealing with gangs and peer pressure. If you liked this book, then you might like \\"Party Girl\\" by the same author; it also deals with drive-by shootings and gangs, but it's intended for slightly older readers (12+).	2002-04-30

Not only is he very private and aloof, but he lives in and owns a museum devoted to horror characters (Dracula, Frankenstein, etc.) called Dungeon of Horrors. Her new lodgings definitely take some time getting used to, especially after Darcy finds a decapitated rat in her bed and bats in her bedroom. Although both incidents frighten her, Darcy isn't prepared for the recent vampire-like murders occurring in Westonport--or the unnerving feeling that she's being stalked by the killer.<br />I thought \\"Vampire\\" was an okay teen horror book. It wasn't the best vampire story I've ever read--in fact, for being a vampire story, it didn't have a lot of vampire action involving fangs and all that--, but it's still pretty good, considering this is the first Richie Tankersley Cusick book I've read so far. The two things that disappointed me, though, were the identity of the killer and the unresolved issue of whether or not s/he was in fact a vampire or if s/he was just delusional. Still, fans of horror/vampires and Miss Cusick will probably enjoy this one. For readers age 12 and up.	2002-04-29

Following their arrival, a lot of accidents occur: a tree branch nearly falls on Cally, a window slams on Kody's (Cally's twin sister) hands, their father accidentally stabs himself, Kody falls off a ladder, and Cubby (the family's new puppy) is missing, yet they can still hear his barking and howls in the house. Plus, someone or something has been knocking on Cally's bedroom door late at night. Kody insists the house is haunted or cursed--and she just may be right when a local teen tells them about their house's history. Thirty years ago, when it was being built, several burial plots were found where the foundation would be poured. Instead of ceasing work, they continued with the job, which resulted in a mysterious massacre of the family that moved in. Thus the evil curse of 99 Fear Street. Will the Frasier family follow the previous owners' fate--or will they escape in time to save their lives?<br />I had started this series because I had heard it was supposed to be pretty good; however, I thought it was quite disappointing. (This can be said for most of the R. L. Stine books I've read.) For starters, the horror scenes in this book are almost comical; they're just flat-out ridiculous sometimes and not very scary at all. Sure they're bloody in parts, but each character pretty much reacts in the same manner by saying \\"Nooo!\\", \\"Owww!\\", or some other nonsense expression we obviously know they'd say when attacked or hurt. Plus the way each chapter ends with a cliff-hanger is so predictable and tedious. A little variation, please! Bad things don't need to happen in every chapter.<br />Although the Fear Street books are geared for preteens, I don't think most young adult readers will be as frightened by these books as, say, elementary children (10 years and younger). So, I'd probably only recommend these books to younger readers. If you enjoyed \\"The First Horror\\" though, then you might like the following two books in this series: \\"The Second Horror\\" and \\"The Third Horror\\". Otherwise, try the Fear Street Saga. That trilogy is much better than this one.	2002-04-28

They both realize they're now \\"roommates\\" when Liz stumbles upon a half-naked Conner in her bathroom. (Liz had accepted Megan Sandborn's invitation to move in with her family; however, she didn't know beforehand that Megan and Conner were half-siblings and living in the same house.) This really complicates things for Liz and Conner, because they've both become infatuated with each other ever since the beginning of the school year, but neither one is willing to admit it. So, when Maria Slater (Liz's close friend) falls head over heels in love with Conner, Liz has no apparent reason to stop her; after all, Maria still thinks Liz hates Conner's guts. And what makes it worse for Liz is that Conner returns Maria's feelings wholeheartedly, when Liz had been certain he still felt something for her.<br />On a lighter note, Liz makes some new friends with Conner's group (Tia Ramirez, Angel Desmond, and Andy Marsden), which is an opportunity for Liz to shed her old image. Although Tia mentions to her boyfriend (Angel) that Liz doesn't seem like a blonde bimbo (Conner's previous opinion of Liz), I'd have to disagree. Liz uses Valley girl slang (\\"like\\", \\"whatever\\", \\"omigod\\") quite often and gossips a lot about clothes, other people, etc. What happened to the good ole practical Elizabeth Wakefield? This ditsy behavior I would have expected from Jessica, but not from Liz.<br />And speaking of Jessica: she's now the social reject of the two, because she got involved with a taken guy, Will Simmons. Now his girlfriend (Melissa Fox) is ruining Jessica's reputation by spreading rumors about her, writing \\"Jessica Wakefield is a slut\\" on the blackboard, and sabotaging Jessica's cheerleading routine. Really, I think Melissa is spending way too much time and energy on the wrong person. What about Will? He's the one who cheated on her. Jessica's entirely innocent.<br />That dilemma is probably the most aggravating thing about this book/series. Well, that and some of the names of these books in this series, starting off with \\"Say It To My Face\\". I know the intended target for SVH Senior Year is teenage girls, but do they have to try so hard to be \\"hip\\" by naming their books \\"As If I Care\\" and \\"So Not Me\\"? I keep expecting the next book to be called \\"Like, Omigod, Whatever\\".<br />Still, I think this is a great series and slightly better than the old Sweet Valley High books. True, there aren't a lot of the old faces from SVH, but the writing is much more compelling. Worth checking out if you're 12+ years-old and enjoy teen drama/romance books.	2002-04-27

Shortly thereafter, they start noticing little things around the house: lights coming on by themselves, doors opening on their own, and cold drafts coming from Lee Ann's bedroom. At first, Carrie and Lee Ann jokingly blame it on `the ghost', thinking the incidents are nothing more than typical problems associated with any old house.<br />However, about 100 pages into it, the book takes an unexpected supernatural twist. Although they had facetiously mentioned a ghost beforehand, I was surprised this was how the book was going. I had thought Secret Friend was about a `dirty ole man' who was stalking Carrie's 14-year-old daughter, not a real-life ghost. At least that's what I had assumed from the synopsis on the back of the book.<br />Anyway, the theories about what's happening in their house range from burglars to poltergeists to telekinesis to mental problems--you name it--, including the occult and witchcraft. With the help of Carrie's new friends (Frank Meredith, Lee Ann's high school guidance counselor and Carrie's new love interest; Barbara Burnett, their neighbor; and Marge Copeland, a psychic), Carrie hopes to discover the real threat before her daughter is tortured any more than she already has been. (As warning: there is some sexual content involving pedophilia, so if you're not comfortable with this, you might not want to read this book.)<br />By the halfway mark, I was beginning to grow bored and disgruntled with this book. For starters, the turn in the plot was unexpected and not very believable. Plus, I thought the book moved very slowly, making those 320 pages seem endless. It wasn't very scary either, and the last page of the book was too abrupt, making me immediately think, That was it? So, unless you're really into supernatural/occult books, I'd skip this one. It's not worth your time or money.	2002-04-22

For Tabitha, it's hardly a reason to be alarmed; after all, her mother, being a somewhat inept witch, has disappeared on several other occasions. Unfortunately, this clumsy trait has been passed on to a disinclined Tabitha, who would like nothing better than to be rid of her supernatural \\"gift\\".<br />Nevertheless, during her parents' absence, Tabitha is given a magical amulet, which was used by her mother in a previous time-travel adventure, \\"Breath of Magic\\". While scrutinizing the gem under a microscope, Tabitha somehow awakens its dormant time-traveling ability, and she--along with her cat, Lucy--are transported back in time to 1254, to the northern part of England. (Why she ended up overseas instead of in New York I'll never understand, but I suppose it's not really important.)<br />Upon her arrival, Tabitha meets 24-year-old Sir Colin of Ravenshaw, the seventh laird of Castle Raven in Scotland. He's currently on the run from Roger Basil Henry Joseph Maximillian, Baron Brisbane (Brisbane, for short), Colin's arch rival in this book. Colin has just returned from the Crusades in Egypt and has discovered that Brisbane invaded his land and killed his family while he was gone. Within 24 hours, Tabitha and Colin are \\"captured by a sadistic madman (Brisbane), thrown into a rat-infested dungeon, and threatened with decapitation.\\" With the help of Tabitha's reluctant witchery, she aides in their escape to Colin's homeland in Scotland, where Colin reunites with Sir Arjon Flenoy (a flirtatious Norman knight who is one of his good friends), as well as reuniting with his loyal citizens, such as timid Jenny (a young girl who was brutally raped by soldiers and has remained mute and afraid ever since), Magwyn (Jenny's strong-minded mother), Chauncey (Colin's obedient young servant), and Auld Nana (Colin's warmly protective, broad-bodied \\"nanny\\").<br />Throughout their life-threatening adventures, Tabitha and Colin inevitably fall in love, despite their sarcastic remarks thrown back and forth. Yet neither are willing to allow a more intimate relationship to develop, not until a pivotal point in the book when Tabitha admits she's a witch. Her confession is more than her typical faux pas; after all, this is the Middle Ages--where witches are burned at the stake. Oops, slight blunder on her part. ;)<br />Being the devout Christian that he is (having traveled to the Middle East to be a part of the Holy Crusade), will Colin save Tabitha from her fiery fate? Or will he submit to his religion and forgo his developing feelings for Tabitha?<br />From the first few paragraphs I read in this book, I knew I would enjoy \\"Touch of Enchantment\\"; by the end, I was totally bewitched (pun intended). I thought it was a wonderfully romantic time-travel fantasy and most romance fans will love it--and even some non-romance fans will as well (speaking as one). Thankfully, there were no abysmal attempts at medieval speech, only the one scene where Tabitha tries to communicate with her capturers by saying: \\"Forsooth, kind sir, methinks it most fortuitous thou hast stumbled upon this damsel in distress.\\" Their reply: \\"What'd she say?\\" \\"Hell if I know.\\" (A sample of the type of humor in this book.)<br />Although I haven't read the first book in this series, \\"Breath of Magic\\", I'm certainly going to make it a priority since \\"Touch of Enchantment\\" was so good. I really enjoyed Terea Medeiros's lighthearted, humorous take on romance novels, especially since I'm not much of a romantic, but I do like to laugh. :)<br />Highly recommended to romance fans, as well as other curious readers who enjoy time-travel fantasies set in medieval Britain.	2002-04-20

Separated from her younger sister (Mona), Ristyn is sent to her grandmother's in the Thousand Islands for the summer. (For some reason, Ristyn's mother thought it appropriate for everyone to grieve apart. I never understood this, but I hardly thought about it while I was reading, only when her mother or sister were mentioned.) Here Ristyn becomes friends with a few of the local teens--Paul \\"Buddy\\" DePasquale (who is a total creep), DeWit King (aka Mr. King or \\"Dimwit\\" by Buddy), the Lemont twins (Eric and Alan), and Heather Wax (Ristyn's homely neighbor). Although Ristyn is having a wonderful time so far attending boat-burning parties and learning how to water-ski with very little adult supervision, everything brightens when her popular older cousin (Shawn Lee Johns) shows up unannounced. She's had a crush on her eccentric cousin for several years, and during his stay, she learns the actual meaning of \\"kissing cousins\\". Besides being a distraction for everyone on the island, Shawn Lee also helps Ristyn collect the 100 butterflies she's been assigned to catch by her freshman biology teacher for that fall--thus the title of this book. (By the way, I thought Shawn Lee's method of collecting them was very creative and humane.)<br />I read this book years ago when I was a kid and had a very difficult time later on trying to find a copy to purchase. (Luckily, I did find one. :) It's really too bad this book is out of print, because it's a fantastic coming-of-age story. It's carefree and funny, and makes you remember exactly what summer was like when you were young. If you like such books, then you'll probably enjoy \\"100 Butterflies\\". It's remained one of my favorite books for over 10 years, and I periodically return to it to peruse a chapter or two. Highly recommended for readers age 10+ (about the age I was when I read it).	2002-04-15

It takes place in Boulder, Colorado, where two 40-something-year-old friends, Margo and B.B. (aka Francine Eloise Brady), deal with the aftermath of their divorces, while at the same time trying to raise teenagers, find decent men to date, and better their professional careers. However, neither one expected Margo to fall for B.B.'s ex-husband, Andrew Broder, who also happens to be Margo's current next-door neighbor. Needless to say, there's some friction between the three friends regarding this new love triangle, and one of these individuals suffers a complete nervous breakdown and has to be hospitalized.<br />The results consequently affect their two daughters: Sara (B.B.'s 12-year-old daughter), who becomes a nervous wreck because of her mother's emotional abuse, and Michelle (Margo's hostile 16-year-old daughter), who gets involved with one of her mother's ex-lovers. (Obviously, boyfriend/husband swamping doesn't end with just the parents.) Even though he was a little older than Michelle, I was still shocked and thought the mother should have been more forceful in separating them.<br />Overall, I thought \\"Smart Women\\" was a terrific book. Most of the characters were easy to empathize with, and the writing was superb. I had read many of Judy Blume's earlier children's books (like \\"Starring Sally J. Freedman As Herself\\", \\"Tiger Eyes\\", and \\"Just As Long As We're Together\\"), but I hadn't known Judy was such a talented adult writer as well. Now that I'm older and have somewhat outgrown her younger books, I wish she would write more adult contemporary novels, like \\"Wifey\\" and \\"Summer Sisters\\". Judy Blume is a fantastic writer--and still one of my favorites. I highly recommend this book, along with all of her others--adult and juvenile.	2002-04-13

The police consider it an accident, but Tess Landers believes differently. She was there at the Boardwalk just before The Devil's Elbow roller coaster detached from its rail and fell dozens of feet below, and she distinctly remembers seeing someone suspicious running away from the ride as it crashed. But nobody else believes her--not her friends, not the police--only the person responsible for causing the accident. And now that person is stalking Tess, leaving unsubtle hints of what will eventually happen to her because of what she knows, or at least suspects.<br />The book alternates between the first-person viewpoint of the unknown killer and the third-person account of Tess. The stranger is clearly obsessed with an old diary s/he finds in his/her family's attic. In it, a past secret is revealed involving several of Santa Luisa's most influential board members of the Boardwalk. This secret (which is predictable and not very shocking) is the main reason why the stranger has decided to kill at least eight of his/her peers.<br />I thought \\"Funhouse\\" was, for the most part, a pretty exciting Point Thriller, but it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. First of all, I was able to guess the killer within the first couple of chapters because of the character's descriptions and their living situations. (Keep those two clues in mind if you want to deduce the killer.) Also, I thought the motive of the killer was a little weak. In my opinion, s/he needed a better reason to go mental than by discovering his/her parents were liars. Honestly, I didn't think they did anything very wrong.<br />If you're a Diane Hoh fan, then you might enjoy \\"Funhouse\\", but you're not really missing much if you decide not to read it. Recommended for teens who enjoy horror.	2002-04-11

While he's busy with an annual Interpol convention, Nancy is getting acquainted with her rich older neighbor, Sarah Amberly, who shares the penthouse floor with them in the Plaza Hotel. For the short time that she knows Sarah, Nancy is worried about the old woman's health. And she has good reason to be, because shortly after they meet, Sarah dies in her suite from an overdose of her heart medicine. At first, Sarah's death is considered a suicide, but when her expensive jewelry collection disappears shortly after her death, the hotel detective (Joe Ritter) considers it murder--and Nancy Drew the main suspect since she was in the suite when Sarah died. Well, of course Nancy didn't kill Sarah Amberly, so she--along with the help of her two friends, Bess Marvin and George Fayne, who drop in for a short visit--decide to uncover this mystery themselves. Here's their list of possible suspects: Maximilian, the mysterious waiter who offers Nancy bits of gossip about Sarah's odd family, yet ominously warns her not to interfere so much; Alison Kale, Sarah's poor, mentally unstable younger sister who may be crazy enough to kill her sibling out of jealousy and rage; Jack Kale, Sarah's nephew who has a major problem with gambling and stealing and may have killed his aunt for the money; Pieter van Druten, Sarah's rich fiancé who may have an ulterior reason for marrying her; and Madame Rosa, Sarah's tarot card reader who foretells of death, possibly as a way to frighten the old woman to death.<br />\\"Rich and Dangerous\\" was a decent enough Nancy Drew mystery, but I thought the whole secret double-identity of the killer was a little too ridiculous and complicated. Still, this book is worth reading if you're a big fan of The Nancy Drew Files series.	2002-04-10

Here the four young children meet a few interesting characters: Tumnus the Faun, a half-goat/half-man that befriends Lucy when she's lost; the Beaver family who help the children elude the White Witch and her dangerous allies; and, lastly, the White Witch herself, who has laid claim over Narnia with her year-round winter spell and her self-proclaimed title: \\"Queen of Narnia\\". She is also the one who lures Edmund to her side with endless supplies of Turkish Delight and subtle hints of him becoming King.<br />During their adventures, the four children ultimately meet Aslan, the rightful king of Narnia who has returned, at last, to reclaim his land from the evil queen. Together they--along with the help of several other mystical beings--aim to defeat the White Witch and return Narnia to its original state and ownership.<br />After reading \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", you'll definitely want to read the following books in this series: \\"Prince Caspian\\" (#2), \\"The Voyage of the 'Dawn Treader'\\" (#3), \\"The Silver Chair\\" (#4), \\"The Horse and His Boy\\" (#5), \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" (#6), and \\"The Last Battle\\" (#7). Although \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is geared for children age 8 to 12, I consider it appropriate for all ages and encourage everyone to read it.<br />I received the entire Narnia collection from one of my aunts when I was a kid, either for my birthday or some other holiday--I don't remember. Anyway, this book/series has been one of my all-time favorites ever since. It's a wonderful fantasy meant for children, but will inspire adults as well. Highly recommended. It also makes a wonderful gift. ;)<br />There are some Christian undertones in this book, such as the terms \\"Daughter of Eve\\" and \\"Son of Adam\\" for humans in Narnia, as well as Aslan's sacrifice for Edmund; however, I don't really regard The Chronicles of Narnia as a religious series. You can expect a wholesome story, but not to worry--it isn't preachy or overly self-righteous.<br />Several years after it was published, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" was made into a TV series in the late 60s, which I never saw because I wasn't born yet. Plus it only aired in the UK. About ten years later, in 1979 (the year I was born), a cartoon movie was made, but I didn't see that one either. The only movie I vaguely recall watching was the 1988 movie starring Richard Dempsey, Sophie Cook, Jonathan R. Scott, and Sophie Wilcox. I remember that even then I wasn't too impressed with it, not as much as I was with the book.<br />So, for those who love children's fantasies, or are just C. S. Lewis fans, then I highly recommend this book and series. It's well worth your time.	2002-04-09

With the help of her close friend, Chiku Williams, Sharon hopes to uncover the meaning of her dreams and find a way to finally put an end to them. However, unbeknown to Sharon, her parents have been keeping a dark secret about her birth and a murder that happened 17 years ago, both of which are important links to her torturous nightmares.<br />\\"I. O. U.\\" is a great supernatural thriller ideal for teens who enjoy scary books about nightmares, demons, and curses. The only letdown is how quickly the bad guy is to identify (which seems to be a faulty pattern in a few of Nicholas Adams's books). Other than that, \\"I. O. U.\\" is a fun and easy book to read. Additional dream-related teen thrillers you might like: \\"Dream Date\\" by Sinclair Smith (nightmares), \\"Sweet Dreams\\" by Kate Daniel (sleepwalking).	2002-04-08

For years, she has used her clairvoyance to help solve these types of murders otherwise considered \\"dead ends\\" by the police. While currently working in Los Angeles regarding a serial killer who has killed seven times so far, Mary begins to believe the tormentor from her past has returned to finally kill her. Mary must force herself to remember exactly what happened when she was a child, because by identifying her attacker, she'll also be able to discover the horrible connection between the recent brutal killings and her troubled past.<br />I thought \\"The Vision\\" was a little disappointing and predictable, mainly because I had already guessed the bad guy about halfway into it, but this book is short and ideal if you're just starting to read anything by Dean Koontz--it's just over 200 pages (hardcover edition; the paperback edition is 300+ pages) and relatively quick and easy to read. There is some offensive material, but nothing too horribly graphic that will make you retch.	2002-04-07

In \\"Double Love\\", the first book in the Sweet Valley High series, 16-year-old Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield are in competition with each other over Todd Wilkins, one of SVH's best-looking basketball players. Jessica, being the go-getter that she is, quickly makes her move and appears successful in winning him over. Yet Liz can't help but suspect Todd is more interested in her than Jessica by all the attention he shows her.<br />However, any interest Todd may have had in her quickly vanishes when rumors of Elizabeth's scandalous date with high school dropout Rick Andover spreads around school. The rumor, however, is just that--a rumor. Elizabeth had never been out with Rick, nor would she ever do so. But there is one person Liz knows of who would accept his offer--her sister. Apparently, Jessica had been escorted home by the police after their disastrous date and had given them Elizabeth's name instead of her own. Both girls try to clear up Liz's reputation--one twin being a little less convincing than the other--, but most of the students at SVH don't believe either girl. What will happen to Elizabeth now that her reputation has been ruined? And, most importantly, how will this affect her chances with Todd?<br />In the meantime, there are a handful of other pettier conflicts developing, such as a possible affair between the twin's father and the new lawyer in his firm (Marianna West); a strange secret their older brother Steven is keeping over a girl; another hidden secret by Liz's best friend Enid Rollins; and a status battle between the Patmans and Fowlers over ownership of the high school football field. Most of these stories are resolved by the end of \\"Double Love\\", but some continue in the next book, \\"Secrets\\".<br />\\"Double Love\\" is not to be missed if you're a Sweet Valley High fan, because this is where it all began, nearly 20 years ago.	2002-04-04

This small community seems immune to crime occurring elsewhere in the world, particularly murder. However, when a pregnant 15-year-old girl (Tara Breckenridge) is found dead--stabbed to death, wrapped in a carpet and discarded in a Dumpster--, the entire island is shocked and eager to seek justice.<br />The woman leading the investigation is 28-year-old Detective Ginger Earley. Her partner is 45-year-old Chief of Police Ruben Martinez, who later becomes Ginger's love interest. Their exploration of suspects and clues lasts for nearly five months, resulting in frequent criticism and forewarnings of losing their jobs. With this added pressure and very few leads, they settle on the most likely suspect: Mr. Jerry Frankel, Tara's 35-year-old high school history teacher. As soon as his identity is revealed, Mr. Frankel and his family are constantly harassed. His being Jewish also brings the worst out in people--and, gradually, a common display of racial and religious hatred emerges throughout the town, creating a very shocking and sad ending.<br />I thought \\"An Isolated Incident\\" was a relatively good mystery and social commentary on intolerance. Most of the characters were described well, although occasionally a little too in-depth. The Puget Sound locale was also perfect, but then I'm biased since I live here. :) However, after reading nearly 500 pages, I thought there were too many unresolved issues in the book. I had to re-read the last couple pages to fully understand the how's and why's of Tara Breckenridge's murder. Although I had suspected the killer from the beginning (clue: his reputation was at stake), I expected more to be revealed about the murder than what was shown at the end. It was quite a let down. But if you like somewhat unsolved cases, then you'll probably like \\"An Isolated Incident\\". I thought, for the most part, it was a very good mystery. The ending was disappointing but realistic; after all, not all murder mysteries are completely solved.	2002-04-03

By then it'll be summer and school will be out--and the principal and his wife will leave Maine for good to pursue another school--and other victims. However, for the couple, 18 days is just enough time for them to drive Christina crazy by strategically placing lighted candles in the house and matchboxes in her belongings. Mr. and Mrs. Shevvington hope by doing this Christina will be provoked enough to become an arsonist and have a nervous breakdown so they can finally prove she's a danger to herself and others.<br />In the meantime, Christina befriends Val Armstrong, the older sister of one of her classmates (Robbie). Val was one of the Shevvingtons previous victims and consequently ended up in a mental institution--until she later escapes and seeks shelter with Christina. However, it's all Christina can do to hide Val and protect herself from the Shevvingtons. In the end will she, too, eventually go crazy like all the others before her?<br />\\"The Fire\\" is the third and--mercifully--the final book in this trilogy, preceded by \\"The Fog\\" (#1) and \\"The Snow\\" (#2). Why this storyline was stretched into three books instead of just one is beyond me. In my opinion, these books are totally absurd and unconvincing, particularly how the Shevvingtons are supposed to have all this evil power over the students and adults. I still didn't understand entirely why the Shevvingtons chose young women as victims or what their purpose was besides just being \\"evil\\", but I don't intend on re-reading this trilogy to find out either. I'm content with being confused. The ending was one of few highlights to this trilogy, though; that's mainly why I gave \\"The Fire\\" three stars instead of a two. Still, I'd only recommend this series to avid Caroline B. Cooney fans. I doubt others will be as interested.	2002-03-27

In it, she briefly explains what she's accomplished in the two-year gap since \\"Dark Angel\\" ended. Heaven is now a teacher back in her hometown, Winnerrow, and she's also engaged to her childhood sweetheart, Logan Stonewall. She asks her father to accompany her to the wedding, but he declines her invitation. (Her real father, Tony Tatterton, doesn't attend either, but Heaven didn't want him there anyway.)<br />After their marriage, Heaven and Logan visit Tony and Jillian Tatterton in Boston before they begin their honeymoon in Virginia Beach. Obviously, this--or any--visit to Farthinggale Manor isn't without its troubles. First off, Jillian has reverted to the past, confusing Leigh (her dead daughter) with Heaven (her granddaughter). She makes quite a spectacle of herself, dressing and looking like a half-crazed clown and insinuating Heaven had seduced her second husband (Tony). Tony, as well, mistakes Heaven for his stepdaughter at times, including one horrible scene later on when he tries to rape Heaven.<br />During their visit, Logan is lured by Tony's power and money and eagerly accepts a job as vice-president of marketing at Tatterton Toys. Heaven is reluctant and suspicious of Tony's \\"help\\", although she allows it all to happen.<br />After their extravagant wedding reception Tony created for them, Heaven and Logan return to Winnerrow where they prepare for the construction of a new Tatterton Toys factory. The couple make several trips back and forth between Boston and Winnerrow, but the most important events are when Heaven realizes her long-lost love, Troy Tatterton, did not die in \\"Dark Angel\\" (in fact, he's very much alive and still in love with Heaven); and when Fanny (Heaven's younger jealous sister) seduces Logan and becomes pregnant by him. Fanny then insists Heaven and Logan support her financially so she can take care of her baby (Luke Jr). Heaven, also, becomes pregnant (with Annie) around the same time Fanny does. However, after being with both Troy and Logan, Heaven doesn't know exactly who the biological father of her child is. This family drama/mystery continues with the next book: \\"Gates of Paradise\\".<br />Previous to \\"Fallen Hearts\\" is \\"Heaven\\" (#1) and \\"Dark Angel\\" (#2). After this book, there are two others: \\"Gates of Paradise\\" (#4) and \\"Web of Dreams\\" (#5). Out of all of V. C. Andrews' series, this one--the Casteel series--is still my favorite. Highly recommended to all V. C. Andrews fans.	2002-03-26

The book alternates between the present and past events leading up to several teen murders. In an investigative phone call between Sergeant Fitzsimmons and Herb Trasker (the 18-year-old male protagonist), Herb explains how he became involved in the murder of a popular cheerleader and various other high school students.<br />Friday:<BR>It began as an immature plan to \\"get even\\" with the cheerleader squad by photographing them while they showered in the locker rooms after practice. Shortly after the scheduled photo shoot, the head cheerleader (Lisa Barnscull) dies in a fiery auto crash at the bottom of a cliff. Herb doesn't think much of the connection between these two events until he's developing the film--and he recognizes two people in the background (one being Sammie Smith, one of his closest friends, hiding in the shadows; the other is Alexa Close, the sweet cheerleader Herb has a crush on, who is creeping up on Lisa with a baseball bat). After this discovery, the next 24 hours are a complete blur for Herb. He trails one suspect after another during a nonstop sleepless night, knowing that if he isn't too careful with the information he has, he could be the next murder victim.<br />When I began \\"Die Softly\\", I wasn't really into it, mainly because the dream in the prologue seemed pointless and a bit too long. But once Herb began describing the events of what happened to Sergeant Fitzsimmons, the book quickly became more interesting. One bit of advice, though: no matter how tempting it is, do not read the last page/sentence of this book ahead of time. I did and it completely ruined the suspense for me. Other than that, if you're into teen horror/suspense, then this is a good book to try. It's really fast-paced and twisted (particularly the ending), everything typical of a good Pike book.	2002-03-25

Yes, let the drama begin. ;)<br />On the Passmore's side, Zoey's father invites his 19-year-old love child (Lara McAvoy) to dinner--and doesn't tell his wife or two kids she's coming until that day. When Lara does arrive (this is Zoey's first time meeting her), her parents ask her to move in for the time being since she's nearly homeless. Zoey is definitely against her parents' decision. From what she assessed of her new half-sister, Lara is a complete loser, mentally dulled by drugs and alcohol and a strong magnet for scuzzy men like her last convict boyfriend. However, there is one person who is absolutely thrilled about Lara's move: Jake McRoyan, Zoey's ex-boyfriend and possibly Lara's new boyfriend. (Has anyone else noticed how \\"incestuous\\" relationships are on this island? I guess there are so many boyfriends/girlfriends you can go through before you start dating each other's siblings.)<br />Meanwhile, Claire and Nina Geiger get to meet their father's new girlfriend (Sarah Mendel)--and her gorgeous 17-year-old son, Aaron. Needless to say, both girls are utterly transfixed by him (along with just about every other girl on the island), but Claire is more so than Nina, since Nina already has a terrific boyfriend (Benjamin Passmore). After that dinner, Claire is bound and determined to get Aaron, even though he's obviously not very interested in her but, instead, attracted to Zoey, although she, too, has a boyfriend (Lucas Cabral), who's a total slug next to Aaron. My guess: the slug eventually gets the boot--and good riddance!<br />\\"Zoey Plays Games\\" is the ninth book in the Making Out series. If you like teen drama/romance, then I highly recommend this series. It's not too cheesy for readers who aren't particularly prone to read such books either; in fact, this series is quite witty and humorous. And if you like Zoey's character, then don't miss any of the other Zoey-oriented books: Zoey Fools Around (#1), What Zoey Saw (#6), Don't Tell Zoey (#13), Zoey Speaks Out (#18), Always Loving Zoey (#22), Now Zoey's Alone (#24), Zoey's Broken Heart (#26), and Zoey Comes Home (#28).	2002-03-24

Although Kim Delaney's uncle is investigating the crime, Kim can't help but worry the kidnapper/murderer will strike again, especially ever since her mother gave birth to a baby girl (Daphne). Kim feels extremely protective of her baby sister. So, when her mother hires a nanny (Barbara Chancellor) to help out while she's at work, Kim is naturally wary and disapproving of the woman. And Miss Chancellor's strict, unpersonable manner doesn't help improve Kim's opinion of her either.<br />(...)<br />I didn't really like the last few pages of the book--they were too rushed and too much happened all at once--, but \\"The Last Lullaby\\" is decent enough reading for most teens who like suspense/horror.	2002-03-21

Seventeen-year-old Melanie Jacobs is new to Clifton, Massachusetts, and looking for part-time summer work besides just baby-sitting. When she answers a newspaper ad to read to an invalid for an hour a day, Melanie expects the person to be an elderly person; instead, it's a young girl her age. Lisa Randolph was paralyzed in a fall shortly before Melanie arrived in town. It's a sad outcome for such a young, popular person, but Melanie soon learns there's more to it than just a tragic accident. While reading \\"Jane Eyre\\" to Lisa, Melanie notices Lisa motions with her hand at certain parts in the book. This, Melanie realizes, is Lisa's way of communicating with her without anyone else finding out. But what secret does Lisa want to tell Melanie and no else? And why has Melanie been threatened lately not to pursue the incident? What exactly happened to Lisa when she fell? Was it just an accident--or did Lisa find out too much herself?<br />\\"The Body\\" is another great teen suspense thriller by Carol Ellis. Fast-paced and easy to read, it'll definitely appeal to teens who enjoy Scholastic's Thriller books.	2002-03-21

Everyone else believes he ran away--including his mother--, but Rae and her friend, Anthony Fascinelli, seriously doubt hes run away, especially not after the psychic clues Rae picks up while reading other peoples fingerprints. These clues take Rae, Anthony, and Yana Savari (another one of Raes pals) on an overnight trip to New Orleans, Louisiana, where they hope to find Jesses abusive, estranged father, the man they believe may have stolen Jesse. However, when their lead doesnt produce Jesse, the threesome is forced to start over, this time interviewing new witnesses with conflicting memories of what happened to Jesse that day. Among the five stories that are given, which one can Rae rely on? Because this time its not just her own life at stake--Jesse might die if she doesnt find him in time.<br />\\"Haunted\\" is the first book Ive read so far in this series. I was quite impressed with this book and hope the others are just as good. Fingerprints is definitely a not-to-be-missed series if you like paranormal teen thrillers.	2002-03-19

It's a real ego boost for him, and he starts to develop a small crush on his teacher. Not a very complicated one though, but you get the hint he's starting for feel something for her.<br />Damon's girlfriend (Jessica Wakefield), however, doesn't feel like he's showing enough interest in her, because he hardly ever includes her in his everyday life, i.e., the developing problem at home with his mother's new boyfriend (Ben). Jessica doesn't realize yet that Damon isn't the type to express his thoughts or feelings freely. So, she interprets his silence as his way of blowing her off. Will Jessica, in turn, split up with him for her hot new science partner, Chris Grassi, who is far more interested in her than Damon appears to be?<br />Meanwhile, Lacey Frells suddenly dumps her older high school boyfriend (Gel), and it looks like she may hook up with Richard Griggs, the most conceited boy in school. Honestly, I think these two are perfect for each other; they're both complete snots.<br />This is the first Sweet Valley Junior High book I've read so far. Unlike most other Sweet Valley books, this book/series is written in the first-person, which does create a bit more \\"closeness\\" between the reader and character, more so than in, say, the Sweet Valley Twins series (an older version of the middle-school years featuring the Wakefield twins, which was also written by the same author, Jamie Suzanne, although I doubt most younger readers will remember these books). Like the SVH: Senior Year series, there are also random journal entries and notes in here, which makes this book/series all the more enjoyable. Recommended for 8 to 12-years-old.	2002-03-18

Now, in 1991, Juliet's ghost appears to another 15-year-old girl, Megan Logan. In just a few weeks Megan will be celebrating her own Sweet Sixteen birthday, but, in the meantime, Juliet pleads for Megan to trade places with her for just one week. At first, Megan is reluctant and scared, but she eventually gives in after hearing Juliet's sad story of dying so young.<br />Once Juliet makes the physical transition into Megan's body, she doesn't waste any time taking over Megan's life--first, by giving herself a sexier makeover and then by seducing Megan's semi-boyfriend (Justin Carr). In time, Juliet's true colors begin to show when she starts acting rude and inconsiderate towards Megan's family and best friend (Hilary Bench).<br />Yet Megan has bigger problems to worry about, such as the recent unexplained accidents befalling her friends and family. Each one ultimately leads back to Megan, and Megan begins to fear she may be the next victim. If she is, what will happen to her soul if she dies while Juliet still inhabits her body? Will she return to life once Juliet leaves--or will she remain a ghost forever?<br />\\"The Accident\\" was the first book I ever read by Diane Hoh, sometime back in my middle school days. After re-reading it ten years later, I can see why I enjoyed it so much. There's plenty of otherworldly suspense in this book, plus it has a terrific ending. If you enjoy supernatural teen thrillers, then you'll probably enjoy \\"The Accident\\".	2002-03-15

Following her is a man that threatens Christine with her life if she ever tells anyone what she saw. And to make sure she doesnt betray him, he stalks her for over a period of 30 years--until one horrible night when Christine returns home from work and finds her husband decapitated and her two young children missing.<br />With the help of her two childhood friends (Eda Crispin, now a New York cop, and Lucille Brigham, a popular mystery writer), Christine desperately searches for her children, while flashing back on her own childhood and the hidden clues that reveal haunting similarities between the murder/child abduction incident three decades ago and Christines present situation.<br />I bought \\"There He Keeps Them Very Well\\" mainly because of the V. C. Andrews-ish front cover, plus the synopsis on the back didnt sound too bad. Once I began casually flipping through the pages, I couldnt stop reading. I finished the entire book in two days; it was that good. If you like fast-paced, twisted-ending mysteries, then youll definitely enjoy this one. Highly recommended.	2002-03-13

In preparation for the upcoming school parade, each student draws a pumpkin and then votes on the best one. That picture is then added to the school-wide contest, where the final winning drawing determines which class is chosen to lead the Halloween school parade. The picture Mrs. Otis's students choose to represent their class is drawn by Todd Wilkins, and it looks exactly like Elizabeth, gap-toothed grin and all. (Elizabeth just lost her front baby tooth.)<br />Meanwhile, the twins (Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield) are arguing over who will get to wear the princess costume on Halloween, while the other twin is left with the witch costume, which neither twin really wants to wear. Jessica insists she should be the princess this year since she has all her teeth and \\"princesses should have perfect smiles\\". However, Jessica's logic fails her when she also loses her front tooth before Halloween. Now who will get to wear the princess costume? And which grade will get to lead the Sweet Valley Elementary School parade? Find out in \\"Sweet Valley Trick or Treat\\". Recommended for 5 to 8-year-old girls.	2002-03-12

However, Angelica has a surprise of her own--she is just as eager to get rid of them as he is. She later reveals to Simon that she, too, is involved in the occult and wishes to manifest her \\"power through evil\\". Clearly, these two are a match made in hell, perfect for each other.<br />Twenty years pass and Simon and Angelica Fear now live in Shadyside Village. They have five children and are extremely wealthy. It seems as though Simon has finally fled his family curse. That is, until one horrible afternoon when two of his daughters are brutally murdered in a twisted turn of events. Thereafter, the Fear couple shut themselves in and refuse to ever leave their mansion.<br />It's not until 35 years later, in 1900, that the final climax to the Fear-Goode saga occurs when Daniel Fear (the grandson of the above couple) falls in love with Nora Goode, a descendent of the Fear's mortal enemies. Nora is the one responsible for starting this trilogy in the hopes that the centuries-old battle between the Fears and Goodes would finally come to an end. And it does, but not exactly as she had hoped.<br />\\"The Burning\\" is the third and final book in The Fear Street Saga, preceded by \\"The Betrayal\\" (#1) and \\"The Secret\\" (#2). This is a must-read for those of you who have already read the previous two books. Highly recommended for Fear Street fans.	2002-03-11

In it, three young high school freshmen (Bernadette \\"Bernie\\" O'Connor, Shelley Jansen, and Nichole Peters) share their problems at work and at home. To begin with, Nichole wants to play matchmaker for Shelley's recently divorced father. Shelley isn't too thrilled about Nichole's approach, but she helps out anyway, hoping she might have better luck with a stepmother than she did with her absent, alcoholic mother.<br />In the meantime, while working as Junior Volunteers at Mercy Hospital, the three girls learn to cope with depressed cancer patients (like Mrs. Olivia Harris, Bernie's new friend), picky world-class chefs (Thomas Forsythe, Shelley's idol), as well overcoming stage fright (Nichole's dilemma) when invited to star in a friend's recruitment video (\\"Meet Mercy\\") designed for future volunteers at the hospital. And to assist in the project is Franco Torelli, a famous director.<br />The one complaint I do have about this book is the title--\\"Don't Tell Mrs. Harris\\". I'm not sure why it concentrated on the situation with Mrs. Harris when the problem barely took up 20 of the 135 pages. Younger readers probably won't mind this as much though.<br />This book/series will most likely appeal to 8 to 12-year-old girls who enjoy stories about hospitals and social situations. Other books in this series: \\"Crisis!\\" (#1), \\"The Best Medicine\\" (#2), and \\"Dr. Cute\\" (#4). Also recommended: Cherie Bennett's Hope Hospital series.	2002-03-10

Levy - A pale woman with a rare skin condition becomes a living work-in-progress for a struggling writer. A little unsettling, yet beautiful. 2.\\"Ice Dreams\\" by Elizabeth Massie and Robert Petitt - A perverse \\"family tradition\\" of ice-cold sex leads to the murder of several young women. This was a pretty good thriller/mystery, except for the child abuse. The ending was great though. 3.\\"Wasting\\" by Lauren Fitzgerald - An at-home tutor helplessly watches as her 14-year-old student succumbs to anorexia nervosa. Psychologically disturbing, but not scary. 4.\\"Backseat Dreams and Nightmares\\" by K. K. Ormond - A 13-year-old girl is raped and killed in the backseat of a car. Completely unnecessary trash. 5.\\"The Stick Woman\\" by Edward Lee - For years, a woman is held captive by her husband in the basement of their home. Without a doubt, the most sickening, memorable story in this book. 6.\\"Soul of the Beast Surrendered\\" by Wayne Edwards - The drawings of a young boy come to life and seek his help. Good ending. 7.\\"October Gethsemane\\" by Sean Doolittle - An artist creates his masterpiece by painting with his own blood. Good ending, especially the pleading review for more of his work by an art critic. 8.\\"Scars\\" by Lucy Taylor - Set in Africa, a man is sexually tormented and manipulated by a demon to kill. 9.\\"ystery orm\\" by Brian McNaughton - A college student receives a mysterious letter concerning his dreams. 10.\\"Tears Seven Times Salt\\" by Caitlin R. Kiernan - A young woman travels into the underground tunnels of New York in search of her heritage. Confusing, bizarre. I didn't understand the point of this one. 11.\\"One-Eyed Jack\\" by S. Darnbrook Colson - The stakes in a game of poker escalate to sexual favors. I didn't think this story belonged here at all. It wasn't remotely scary. Just another excuse for more gratuitous sex, I guess. 12.\\"Elena\\" by Steve Rasnic Tem - A woman's various sexual exploits with men and women. Again, not scary at all. 13.\\"Family Album\\" by Adam-Troy Castro - A father witnesses his son's brutal death by looking at the photo album his serial killer made. Too short even for a short story--3 pages--, but probably not one I'd enjoy even if it were lengthened. 14.\\"Having Eyes, See Ye Not?\\" by Sue Storm - Imitating Jesus' death, a young woman crucifies herself. Confusing, another baffler. 15.\\"Sisters in Death\\" by D. F. Lewis - Three sisters share the same bed and die young. Very short. I didn't understand this one at all. Not going to try either, even though it's only 2 pages. 16.\\"Window of Opportunity\\" by Roman Ranieri - A young man seeks payback on his bully. Pretty good 4-paged story, but not exactly horror. 17.\\"Envy\\" by Christa Faust - An s/m routine between two lesbians. Pornographic, not scary. 18.\\"The Man of Her Dreams\\" by Alan M. Clark - For years, a young woman is haunted by her dead abusive stepbrother. 19.\\"For the Curiosity of Rats\\" by Jeffrey Osier - After the death of their young daughter, a married couple tries to cope with their loss. 20.\\"The Stranger Who Sits Beside Me\\" by Yvonne Navarro - The woman who sits next to him on the commuter train slowly replaces his wife. A puzzler. 21.\\"In Pieces\\" by Deidra Cox - A woman seeks a new victim for her kidnapper. 22.\\"Voices Lost and Clouded\\" by David B. Silva - An older man is haunted by the accusatory questions of his mother. 23.\\"If Memory Serves\\" by Jack Ketchum - A woman with a multiple personality disorder retells her horrific, Satanic upbringing. Good ending. 24.\\"The Tears of Isis\\" by James S. Dorr - A woman is forced to remember her incestuous relationship with her brother when she starts seeing apparitions of a crying woman. Deals with Egyptian mythology. 25.\\"Stick Around, It Gets Worse\\" by Brian Hodge - A man comes to terms with the purpose of his life after his wife dies. 26.\\"Voices in the Black Night\\" by Larry Tritten - A trip to the library changes a man's life when he meets another man who can hear the books speaking. 27.\\"Stealing the Sisyphus Stone\\" by Roberta Lannes - A pedophile seeks treatment via virtual reality. 28.\\"The Nightmare Network\\" by Thomas Ligotti - A multinational corporation creates chaos among its employees. Confusing, boring, a bunch of long-winded gibberish. 29.\\"Fiends by Torchlight\\" by Wayne Allen Sallee - The \\"Oklahoma City Bomber\\" shares his conspiracy theories. 30.\\"...And Thou Hast Given Them Blood to Drink (and They Are Drunken with the Blood of Saints and with the Blood of Martyrs...)\\" by T. Winter-Damon and Randy Chandler - A lengthy biblical explanation of how the world is going to hell.<br />(...) I began this book at full-speed last November until I read Edward Lee's \\"The Stick Woman\\", and then I set the book aside for two months before slowly continuing with the others. If you've already read the above story, then you'll understand my shock. It was hard to digest such a brutal, appalling story--and what was even worse to imagine was that this sort of activity actually happens in our society. \\"The Stick Woman\\" left me completely desensitized, and it certainly reconfirmed my underlying belief that there is \\"no end to the absolute evil of men\\". (p 63)<br />In summary, this book was a complete gore fest with pretty much every author trying to outdo the other with the most traumatic, disgusting childhoods and fantasies. The majority of them are very disturbing and graphic. There are a few good stories in here though (i.e., \\"Skin Writers\\", \\"Ice Dreams\\"), but the rest are just polluted with extreme sex and violence. I would strongly discourage most people from reading this book. If you're used to reading about snuff and such, then proceed; otherwise, skip this one and preserve your sanity. In my opinion, somebody needs to stick a warning sticker or an NC-17 rating on this book.	2002-03-09

Darkness, I\\"<br />\\"Darkness, I\\" is the third continuing story of the Scarabae. The child murderess, Ruth, has been killed and now her mother, Rachaela, is pregnant with another daughter, Anna, named for one of the Scarabae women Ruth had killed in Dark Dance. Anna is similar to her dead older sister--she, too, ages quickly and is just as bright and intelligent as Ruth, yet her temperament is not as violent.<br />And as before, with her first pregnancy, Rachaela is extremely detached from her child, growing jealous every day of Anna's kinship with Althene, Rachaela's longtime lover and \\"father\\" of Anna. Rachaela knows the Scarabae are very incestuous, and she believes she'll be overlooked by Althene for her daughter.<br />This everyday Scarabae family drama ends, however, when Anna is kidnapped, along with several other children, and brought to an ice pyramid as \\"guests\\" for Cain, an outcast vampire of the Scarabae family. Althene, as well as Malach (who is seeking the reincarnated Ruth), search for Anna, while, in the meantime, she is gradually transformed into Cain's child bride, Ankhet.<br />Until I read \\"Darkness, I\\", I thought this series was perfect. However, \\"Darkness, I\\" makes a drastic change to the storyline, one that's not very consistent or expected after reading the previous two books. Maybe if Cain or the Egyptian vampire myths had been mentioned before, I wouldn't have had such a hard time accepting this plot.<br />Despite my slight disappointment in \\"Darkness, I\\", I would love to see another sequel published, especially considering how this book ended. But I hope it's more like \\"Dark Dance\\" (#1) or \\"Personal Darkness\\" (#2). \\"Darkness, I\\" is a fair effort to the Blood Opera Sequence, but it's not a very good conclusion to this series.	2002-03-06

In it, Aubrey is left with only 200 pounds and a final farewell from his father--that Aubrey \\"make something of his useless life\\". Needless to say, Aubrey and his father never got along prior to his death--and, by the looks of things, even after his death.<br />In an attempt to communicate with his father's angry ghost, Aubrey attends a seance hosted by Ronald Cockcroft, an upper-class psychic who later becomes Aubrey's mortal enemy near the end of the book. After this meeting, Aubrey makes a special acquaintance with his friend's manservant (Michael Hornchurch) and a well-known clairvoyant (Binnie Griswold, aka Madame La Zonga), who both help reawaken Aubrey's dormant psychic abilities. Soon Aubrey finds himself talking with the dead (including one irksome soul who doesn't believe he's dead), traveling outside of his physical body (to watch the chorus girls undress, among other devious things), and levitating carpets, etc. Eventually, all these new skills will be put to the test when Aubrey challenges Cockcroft to a psychic duel to exorcise a troublesome ghost. This \\"Duel of the Mediums\\" could either make Aubrey the \\"Prince of Psychics\\"--or it could make him go crazy and die in the process.<br />\\"Strong Spirits\\" is the second book in the Aubrey series, the first being \\"The Devil You Say\\". (I'm not sure if this is a continuing series or just books loosely-based on certain characters since this is the first book I've read by Elisa DeCarlo.) Aubrey was definitely a likable character, even though he's a bit dimwitted, spoiled, and headstrong. Still his mischievous behavior made the story very fun. The writing was great as well, filled with authentic 1920s English slang. So, if you're looking for a lighthearted, paranormal fantasy set in the late 1920s (I doubt there are many of these), then you should definitely read \\"Strong Spirits\\". It'll definitely appeal to people who don't like to read very much either--it's only 151 pages.	2002-03-04

For starters, the most complicated one occurs between Will Simmons and Melissa Fox. When he breaks up with her, she basically falls apart under the stress of what other people will think of her--and worse, that Jessica Wakefield will swoop in on her ex now that he's a \\"free man\\". However, Melissa couldn't be further from the truth, especially since Jessica has made it perfectly clear to Will she doesn't want anything to do with him.<br />Will isn't the only guy to fall on Jessica's bad side, though. There's also Jeremy Aames, who Jessica believes has been avoiding her since the humiliating party scene in \\"If You Only Knew\\" (#5). She doesn't know, however, that Jeremy's recent absence is the result of his father's heart attack. Their lack of communication--and Jess's wild imagination--blows everything out of proportion.<br />And then there's the matter of the most mismatched couple ever--Conner McDermott and Elizabeth Wakefield. I must say, at the beginning of this series, I found their love/hate squabbles pretty amusing, but now that Conner's true nature has emerged, I seriously doubt these two will ever have a workable future. I mean, while he and Liz are still playing tonsil-hockey (with no strings attached, of course), Liz is trying to keep it a secret from his ex, Maria Slater (even though Maria's starting to suspect something), but Conner seemed intent on having Maria catch them. Whether he wanted to make her jealous or not, I don't know, but this book really shed some light on the \\"real\\" Conner. Apparently, he has no regard for other people's feelings. Liz had better get some sense into that fuzzy blonde head of hers before Conner seriously takes her for a ride and she ends up losing Maria for good as a friend. Sexy or not, Conner is not worth it (which just so happens to be his own motto on every girl he's been with, including Liz).<br />\\"Your Basic Nightmare\\" is the sixth book in the SweetValley High: Senior Year series. Worth checking out if you're into teen romances and enjoy Sweet Valley books.	2002-03-03

It takes place in another world where Roland, the gunslinger, pursues The Man in Black across dry, dangerous terrain, entering town after town and stumbling across various characters who will ultimately lead him to a mortal battle with The Man in Black.<br />This series/book isn't like King's typical horror fare (i.e., &quot;Cujo&quot; or &quot;Carrie&quot;); it has more of a western/sci-fi feel to it. That's probably why I didn't like it as much. But if you're into this type of genre, then you'll more than likely enjoy the Dark Tower series--&quot;The Gunslinger&quot; (#1), &quot;The Drawing of the Three&quot; (#2), &quot;The Waste Lands&quot; (#3), and &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot; (#4).	2002-03-02

One of My Favorites	In &quot;The Silver Metal Lover&quot;, 16-year-old Jane narrates the first time she falls in love with a robot named S.I.L.V.E.R., which stands for Silver Ionized Locomotive Verisimulated Electronic Robot. At first, Jane is horrified and frightened by this machine that looks so much like a human being; she can't seem to comprehend that something so human-like could only be a bundle of wires and springs--and that something so alien could arouse her so much.<br />Eventually, Jane does revert to her initial attraction to him, which makes her want to find a way to &quot;own&quot; him, even if that means giving up all her possessions, money, and status to become a social pariah, just as long as she can be with him forever.<br />This is a very touching and captivating book. And it's kind of ironic that I consider it to be one of my favorite books, since I generally don't like romance or sci fi books. But I do love Tanith Lee's writing style, and that's why I decided to read it. So, if you're like me and tend to avoid most romantic/futuristic novels, then you should definitely try this one. You just might change your mind about such books.<br />Finally, it looks like a sequel is in the works--&quot;Metallic Love&quot;--and will hopefully be out soon. I can't wait to find out if it's as good--or even better--than the first.	2002-02-28

It still takes place in Deer Lake, Minnesota, but the female protagonist has changed. Instead of Agent Megan O'Malley leading the investigation into the abduction of 8-year-old Josh Kirkwood, it's now up to 35-year-old Ellen North, the prosecuting attorney, to prove Dr. Garrett Wright guilty of kidnapping. Because Dr. Wright is such an influential member of the community, Ellen is faced with some fierce opposition from his colleagues and supporters (like the Space Cowboys), but especially from Wright's defense attorney, Anthony Costello (Ellen's old-time flame who has a malicious way of practicing law).<br />Now although Josh has mysteriously been returned to his family without being physically harmed (emotionally and psychologically he's a mess), the young boy refuses to speak for fear of all the evil things the Taker could do to him and his family. Without Josh's assistance, Dr. Wright just might walk free. However, he might just be proved innocent anyways when--while still in custody--another 8-year-old boy is kidnapped from a neighboring town. Ellen begins to speculate that Dr. Wright might have an accomplice who is trying to divert attention from Wright by committing various crimes he obviously couldn't have committed. But when Ellen goes after Wright's closest friends, she gains a high-rising number of enemies, all of whom could be suspects in the kidnappings and would like nothing more than to stop Ellen's investigation for good.<br />\\"Guilty As Sin\\" began with a strangely out-of-place prologue that left me a little baffled. It wasn't until I was nearing the end of the book that I realized it had been taken from an attack scene between the kidnapper and Ellen. In my opinion, the excerpt should have been kept at the end of the book where the event actually occurred, not as a senseless hook. I'm sure I wasn't the only one confused by it.<br />As usual, my main complaint with any Tami Hoag book is the budding romance between the leading lady and the dark, brooding hunk she's pitted against. Well, in this case, Ellen has two men to juggle, but one (Jay Butler Brooks, a Southern bestselling crime novelist) takes precedence over the other (Anthony). In my opinion, the entire relationship between Ellen and Jay should have been removed, or at least edited. There had already been one troublesome relationship before with Megan and Mitch in \\"Night Sins\\", so why follow the same formula with similar-acting characters who are only varied by their occupations? (Megan was a tough-minded BCA agent; Ellen is a tough-minded attorney; Mitch is a relentless police chief; Jay is a relentless writer. In the end, they all shed their emotional armor, inhibitions, and clothes in the heat of passion. It's all very predictable and boring.)<br />Don't get me wrong; this book isn't all that bad. The action and drama--plus the final climax--were all great and shocking. However, I thought it was much too long, complex, and occasionally too romantic to be a mystery. Plus, was it really necessary to stretch the plot into a second book? If given a major editing overhaul, the entire story could have fit into one medium-sized book instead of two behemoths and made plenty of readers far more happier. I mean, who really wants to read 1145 pages about a kidnapping? I know I already did, but I would have preferred reading about half of that.<br />Still if you've finished \\"Night Sins\\" and want to find out how this case ends, then you should definitely read \\"Guilty As Sin\\". It's worth reading 605 more pages to find out who abducted Josh Kirkwood. (...)	2002-02-28

She had hoped this would be a great opportunity to earn extra money for college, as well as get a great tan and relax. However, when she meets her young next-door neighbor, Cleve Davidson, and he starts asking her nosy questions about her job, her \\"aunt\\", etc., she realizes she doesn't have a good answer for alot of his questions, nor does she know exactly what's going on either. When she confronts Mrs. Nelson (her employer) about the persistent phone calls and her other dubious activities, Becky is shocked by what's really going on: Mrs. Nelson had recently escaped with her son from an abusive husband back in California. She had hoped to be able to hide away on Sebastian Island for awhile, but now Mrs. Nelson is afraid her husband has found them and wants his family back for good. But what will he do once he finds them? And what can Becky do to help protect Mrs. Nelson and Devon if he wants more than just custody of Devon? What if he wants to phsycially harm--possibly murder--all three of them?<br />\\"Mother's Helper\\" is a great, fast-paced teen thriller with several surprising twists and turns at the end.

Nevertheless, Maria aims to win him back no matter what.<br />Meanwhile, Jeremy Aames is still infatuated with Jessica Wakefield, but she's trying to brush him off. That's not going to stop Jeremy from trying though, even though he's swamped with school activities, sports, and a part-time job that will hopefully improve his family's financial situation.<br />\\"If You Only Knew\\" is the fifth book in the Sweet Valley High: Senior Year series. This is another great addition to the teen romance drama that's been building since the beginning of the school year.

Both Kristy and Stacey are also looking forward to the Friday dance, but the girls' fantasies are sidetracked when they believe a local jewel thief (the Phantom Caller) has picked Stoneybrook as his next target. His trademark is to make anonymous phone calls before breaking into the house. So, when the girls start receiving call hang-ups while baby-sitting, they're afraid the Phantom Caller might strike anytime while they're alone.<br />\\"Claudia and the Phantom Phone Calls\\" isn't a very scary mystery, but considering it's for 8 to 12-year-olds, it's a pretty good BSC book.

Everyone thinks she either jumped or accidentally fell, but Shari knows she was pushed, even though she doesn't have a clue as to who would have done such a thing. While her spirit is still earthbound, Shari seeks out her killer with the help of a fellow dead high school student, Peter Nichols (the same one the group communicated with while using a Ouija board). To uncover the truth, Shari enters the dreams of her friends and brother, as well as following them around, in the hopes of finding some minute clue that will help explain her death. What she discovers is far more bizarre and twisted than she ever could have imagined. All the while, she's constantly being chased by a haunting black replica of the Grim Reaper (The Shadow), who wants to possess her soul.<br />I absolutely loved this book as a kid. Still do, actually. It was the first book I ever read by Christopher Pike, and that was eons ago, back in fifth grade ('89). \\"Remember Me\\" does have two sequels--\\"Remember Me 2: The Return\\" and \\"Remember Me 3: The Last Story\\"--, but I certainly wouldn't recommend them over this one. I began \\"The Return\\" over a year ago and am still dreading having to finish it. It was that bad.<br />Whether you're a Pike fan or not, I highly recommend this paranormal teen thriller. It's absolutely incredible--one of Pike's best books yet.	2002-02-17

Unfortunately, very few of the women he impregnates live for very long, including Gifford, Edith, Mandy, Lindsay, Clytee, and Alicia Mayfair. They all die shortly after sex, resulting from uterine hemorrhaging. The only woman, so far, who can carry a Taltos to full term is Rowan Mayfair, who is the thirteenth witch and also Lasher's birth mother. At the beginning of this book, Rowan is pregnant with Emaleth, Lasher's soon-to-be mate. During her entire pregnancy, Rowan is hidden away in various European locales (such as Berlin, Paris, and Geneva) so that no one--particularly her family--will be able to find them. The couple do eventually return to the States, where Rowan gives birth to Emaleth, and Lasher pursues the above mentioned Mayfair women.<br />Meanwhile, Michael Curry (Rowan's husband) and the other Mayfairs are teaming up with Aaron Lightner and Yuri Stefano (two ex-members of the Talamasca) to protect the women in the Mayfair family from Lasher's devious scheme, as well as attempting to find Rowan--alive, hopefully. However, working against them are two Talamasca replacements, Erich Stolov and Clement Norgen, who will do everything they can to capture Lasher alive, even if that means killing anyone in their way.<br />A few new members of the Mayfair clan make appearances in \\"Lasher\\", such as Mona, the redheaded 13-year-old nymphomaniac who seduces Michael and becomes pregnant by him; her drunken parents (Alicia--the same one mentioned above who dies because of Lasher--and Patrick) and her wise, quiet great-grandmother (Ancient Evelyn).<br />\\"Lasher\\" begins where the last book (\\"The Witching Hour\\") left off. This book is almost half the size of the first, mainly because there's no lengthy family history to sort through. Well, there is Lasher's biographical speech at the end of the book, but that only takes up about 100 pages, not hundreds like in \\"The Witching Hour\\".<br />If you enjoyed \\"The Witching Hour\\", you'll love this sequel. And don't miss \\"Taltos\\" either, the third and final book in this series. All three of these books are must-reads for Anne Rice fans.	2002-02-14

While the majority of the books in this series are written from Cathy Dollanganger's perspective, it is now the Grandmother's turn to relate her own life history. Even though I didn't feel a lot of sympathy for Olivia Winfield (the Grandmother), at least it was easier to understand where she was coming from.<br />The book begins sometime in the early 1900s in New London, Connecticut, where a plain 24-year-old Olivia Winfield meets a<BR>handsome, rich gentleman named Malcolm Neal Foxworth. Olivia is bewildered yet excited when he proposes to her and, after the wedding, brings her to Foxworth Hall in Virginia. Here the story begins to unfold. We soon learn Olivia's real purpose as Malcolm's wife is to be a &quot;breeder&quot; and give him sons, which she does--two of them, Mal and Joel. And later on, the secret of Corrine and Christopher's birth parents is revealed. In previous books, they were considered half-uncle and niece, but they're really half-siblings. (Long story.) So, when they begin to fall in love, it's no wonder Olivia and Malcolm panic. Corrine and Christopher, however, ignore their warnings and later elope. The rest is history.<br />Obviously, there's some incest in this book. If this bothers you, you might not enjoy &quot;Garden of Shadows&quot; (or any other V. C. Andrews book, for that matter). But for the rest of you, I'd certainly recommend this one, especially to Dollanganger fans. It finally completes the series and answers all those dark questions that have been building since &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;.	2002-02-12

First it was the animal keeper at the game farm, and then the high school student, Chrissie Kelly, followed by the hunter who was on its trail. But for two teenagers--Cory Darnell and Holly Parker--these killings mean more than just the random, thoughtless attacks of a cougar. For Cory, its physical proof of the unaccountable bloody visions that have been plaguing him lately. He cant remember where hes been or what hes done when he blacks out at night, but he remembers the hunt and the kill of all three people vividly. Is he, indeed, responsible for killing his girlfriend and the other two people--or is there something far more sinister happening in Branton? The one person who knows the answer to this is Holly, the lone teen investigator who is out to prove that the cougar is just a cover up for a much larger, smarter creature--a werewolf. But first she must find out who the werewolf is, because after only three deaths, the creature is hardly satiated, and more people are likely to die unless Holly can find and kill it before then.<br />The ending of \\"Santa Claws\\" was definitely exciting, even though I had guessed the secret of the werewolf beforehand. Still its well worth reading if youre a fan of horror and, especially, of werewolves. As warning, there is some violence, but its tolerable if youre used to blood and guts and youre older than twelve. The ending did leave a possibility for a sequel, which I would love to see happen. I really enjoyed this book and think a second book would be just as good.<br />The only thing that bothered me, though, was the front cover and the title of this book--both greatly misrepresented the story. Theres very little to do with Christmas except the mention of holiday caroling and decorations at the end of the book, plus the snow. And the creature on the front cover could have been anything, but hardly looked like a wolf of any kind, least of all a werewolf. If I had known \\"Santa Claws\\" was about werewolves, I probably would have started it a lot sooner.	2002-02-07

The Mercandy mansion in Sweet Valley, California, has always been considered haunted. The old woman who lives there is thought to be an evil witch who keeps her husband locked away in the attic.<br />Then one day, a young girl arrives at the house from Pennsylvania. She's Nora Mercandy, an orphan and the granddaughter of the elderly couple.<br />Everybody's curious about this new girl, especially the Wakefield twins: Elizabeth and Jessica. Unfortunately, almost everybody at Sweet Valley Middle School believes Nora is a witch just like her grandmother, and she's ostracized by her peers from the first day of school. Elizabeth, however, being more sympathetic and kind, offers to be Nora's tour guide around the school. Jessica, on the other hand, along with her friends in the Unicorn Club, do everything they can to make Nora feel unwelcome.<br />To begin with, Lila Fowler places a bet with Nora during a tennis match which Nora wins. When Nora accepts her prize (Lila's expensive pen), Lila reports the item missing, resulting in a trip to the principal's office for \\"Nora the Theif\\". <br />Lila strikes again during a math exam when she switches her failing test paper with Nora's. Nora, who generally excels at math, is astonished to find her \\"D\\" score two days later. However, she doesn't do anything about it, even though she recognizes Lila's handwriting on her paper. I'm not sure which I found more irritating: Lila's cheating or Nora's submissiveness.<br />Finally, the Unicorns invite Nora to Lila's Halloween party as a chance to vandalize Nora's home with toilet paper and trash. I'm still not certain why Nora took the bait, but she did. The result, however, is not all bad. Despite the vicious tricks put on by the Unicorns, Nora comes out on top in the end.<br />\\"The Haunted House\\", the third book in the Sweet Valley Twins series, is a great book for 8 to 12-year-old girls. If you enjoyed this book, I highly recommend you read the other books in this series, as well as anyother book by Francine Pascal.	2002-02-07

It sounds pretty complicated, but Elizabeth and Jessica pick up on it within minutes--even featherbrained Jessica.<br />Elizabeth and Jessica promise to keep it a secret with their father as a fun game, but their loyalty is tried when the girls' best friends (Amy Sutton and Lila Fowler) demand to know their secret or else. The reaction to the twins' secrecy is a little over dramatic and immature, but then again this is middle school.<br />Lila even refuses to invite the twins to a big star-studded party unless they tell her everything. Jessica, of course, is the first to break her promise. Soon everybody at Sweet Valley Middle School starts talking \\"Ithig\\", mainly as a way to confuse their new teacher Ms. McDonald.<br />\\"Keeping Secrets\\" certainly isn't the best Sweet Valley Twins book I've read so far, but if you're into secret languages, you might like this one.	2002-02-07

Playing opposite The Unicorn Club is the Eight Times Eight Club (eight other middle school girls), their arch rivals. Whichever team loses will have to sing \\"Puff the Magic Dragon\\" in front of the entire school, not to mention being completely humiliated on national TV.<br />While the Unicorns are busy trying to remember each other's hobbies and such, they're also preoccupied with earning $300, to pay back their principal for destroying his last toupee. By working together, the girls are hopefully making a bond that will survive the tricky questions of the upcoming show. But if they do lose, will they have what it takes to remain friends--or will they become bitter enemies instead?<br />This series reminded me a lot of The Baby-sitters Club series by Ann M. Martin and the Taffy Sinclair series by Betsy Haynes. Both series are geared towards more younger readers (8 to 12-year-old girls) and deal with cliques/clubs and female competition over popularity, boys, etc. I was never much of a Unicorn fan when I was reading the Sweet Valley Twins series years ago, and I'm not much of one now. The girls are much too superficial and selfish, and even though Elizabeth tries to clear up their reputation in this book, they still come through as snobs. (By the way--since this is Elizabeth's story--, why is she in the club? Last time I remember, she disliked Lila and the Unicorns. Conflicting storylines.)<br />I can't say that this new series is such a great idea. Unless you're an avid Unicorn fan--or just love to read anything by Francine Pascal--, I'd recommend sticking to the Sweet Valley Twins series instead.	2002-02-06

There aren't any neighbors nearby, just an old deserted house next door that's been abandoned for years. That is, she thought it was deserted until she starts seeing lights come on in the house. Then one night she meets her new neighbor (Julian Dax) who jokingly attacks her while she's taking out the garbage. Scaring people is just one of the few things Julian loves do. He also enjoys manipulating people, and since Randy is already head over heels for him, she becomes his newest puppet. Anything he says, Randy does, such as pulling cruel pranks on her history teacher and several of her classmates--from arranging a fake tarantula in her teacher's desk to forging a love letter to staging a skating accident by pouring oil down a hill. Julian insists by doing these things, it will make her feel \\"alive\\" and \\"on the edge\\".<br />Soon Randy feels like she has no control over what she does. On one hand, she's reluctant to commit the crimes for fear of being<BR>caught and reprimanded; on the other, she's afraid of what Julian might do if she doesn't follow through. The book started to get very exciting towards the end when Randy couldn't tell if Julian was real or just a figment of her imagination. Even her best friend, Alice, thought Randy was starting to crack. That was probably the best part of the book. The ending was minimally satisfying with the discovery of Julian's hideout (...), but the book as a whole wasn't spectacular. It's still fun to read though if you like young adult thrillers.	2002-02-04

Patty meets her first German while helping out in her family's general store. The POWs are brought into the store for hats, and Patty dutifully--and out of curiousity--approaches the only dark-haired, English-speaking soldier in the group: Frederick Anton Reiker. He is much older than Patty (22-years-old), but he treats her like an equal. From that first meeting, Patty's opinions of Germans greatly changes, and she can't help but be captivated by him.<br />So, when she sees him running near her house, having just escaped the prison camp, Patty insists that he stay in her family's deserted garage for as long as he needs to, which is only for a few days. I had expected Patty and Anton's relationship to last a little longer (and I'm certain Patty wished the same thing), but it only takes up about one-third of the book. The remaining two-thirds is Patty's account of her torturous life, of being beaten and then ignored by her hot-tempered father, criticized constantly by her beautiful mother, and other everyday miseries involving her narrow-minded neighbors.<br />This book is quite depressing but realistic. I often wondered how--and if--Patty would ever survive her life, but I suppose that is the point of this story: to find hope despite the obstacles. Patty discovered that by befriending Anton, and he had enough of an impact on her to last the rest of her life.<br />My sister recommended this book to me years ago, and I finally got around to reading it just recently. I'm not sure why I didn't start it sooner, because it was very good. I would certainly recommend it to others (age 12 and up). The only complaint I have about the book (which is quite petty, really) is the book cover. Anton's description in the book doesn't match his appearance on the front cover. He supposedly has black hair, not dirty blonde hair. Maybe it was to exaggerate the blonde-hair-blue-eyed German stereotype. Who knows.<br />Anyway, following the book, in 1978, a TV movie was made of Summer of My German Soldier (which I haven't seen, so I can't<BR>comment on it) and a sequel was written, called Morning Is a Long Time Coming (which I haven't read yet either, but intend to).	2002-02-04

Since one of Dolly's fears is of heights, Mr. and Mrs. Shevvington insist she overcome it by taking skiing lessons. But Christina knows firsthand they don't want to help Dolly. If anything, they want to destroy her mind like they did to Anya in the previous book, The Fog. And it's up to Christina to protect her friend and disrupt the Shevvingtons' plan.<br />My opinion of the first book (The Fog) wasn't so great, and neither is my opinion of this book, but at least in The Snow, Christina discovers the identity of the rubber man on the beach, as well as the secret in the cellar. The girls--especially Christina--are constantly being tortured psychologically and pitted against one another, just like in the first book. There seems to be no hope or any apparent possibility of being saved, which I found way too depressing and irritating.<br />The one good thing I can say about this book is that it's very quick and easy to read. (I finished it in one day.) Cooney's writing is still pretty good, but I can't say that I liked the story at all. So, unless you're already a fan, I'd skip this trilogy: The Fog, The Snow, and The Fire. Caroline B. Cooney can do--and has done--much better than this.	2002-02-04

By memorizing and practicing beforehand, they hope their experience will pay off during the kissing games at Karen's party, especially since the two boys (Mark Ritchie and Danny DePuzo) they have crushes on will be there. However, the one complication they face is the new girl Karen reluctantly invites to the party, Star Sumner, the beautiful seventh grader who lives nearby. Both Karen and Janet think she'll be too much of a distraction for either girl to get anywhere with Mark and Danny, but it still won't stop them from trying.<br />The funniest part in the book is when Karen gets a straw stuck up her nose while she's out with Mark and their friends--and then later, absentmindedly, she drinks out of the same straw. This is just one of the few comical scenes in the book. It's really quick and fun to read (under 100 pages), and if you can relate to the girls' kissing dilemma, then you'll more than likely enjoy &quot;Karen Kepplewhite Is the World's Best Kisser&quot;. Recommended for preteen girls.	2002-02-03

While struggling with her emotions over Connan and his just-as-difficult daughter, Martha must also try and uncover the mysterious death of his wife before she, too, faces the same fate Alice did.<br />\\"Mistress of Mellyn\\" was the first book I ever read by Victoria Holt, and it also happens to be the first book Eleanor Alice Burford Hibbert wrote under this pseudonym over 40 years ago. It was given to me by one of my aunts when I was about 11 and is still one of my favorites, even though I'm not necessarily a romance fan. But if you are--or even if you're just a reluctant gothic romance reader like I am--, then you'll more than likely enjoy this one. There's nothing offensive or racy in it, so it's appropriate for all ages, yet it's still very suspenseful. Highly recommended.	2002-02-01

Farthinggale Manor has now become her new home, the same place where her long-since-dead teenage mother lived and fled from in fear. It is now Heaven's turn to discover the sordid secrets this family has hidden for almost 20 years.<br />But first, Heaven is lured to give up her freedom to Tony in return for all the opportunities his money can buy, including an education at an exclusive private school for girls called Winterhaven. His money can't buy the student's opinion of her, however, and, once again, Heaven feels like an outsider. The girls are extremely cruel to Heaven and, in one incident, they slip laxatives in her drink at a party. The prank backfires on one of the girls when Heaven dares her to slide down the laundry shoot--and into a pile of... well, human excrement, to put it nicely, courtesy of Heaven. Very gross, I know, but I couldn't help but laugh.<br />Anyway, on the romantic side of \\"Dark Angel\\", Heaven meets Tony's younger brother, Troy, who later becomes Heaven's longtime, brooding lover. (Troy is, so far, the sexiest male character Andrews has ever come up with. I absolutely love Troy.) Heaven does meet up with Cal Dennison once in this book, but not as a romantic gesture. There's obviously no chemistry between those two, but Cal seems to think so and tries to rape her. And, as for Logan Stonewall, Heaven tries to rekindle their childhood romance (this is before she gets involved with Troy), but he's still hurt and angry by her relationship with Cal and pushes her away.<br />Now, although Heaven promised Tony she would exclude her family from her life completely, she does try to contact her four siblings: Fanny who, of course, has gotten herself into trouble by giving birth to the reverend's child in return for $10,000, but she later changes her mind and insists Heaven doeverything she can to return her baby; Keith and Our Jane are terrified of Heaven because they think she's trying to take them back to the Willies; and Tom has joined the circus with their father and seems content enough.<br />By the end of this book, several secrets are unearthed (including the truth of Heaven's biological father), some relationships are rebuilt (Logan and Heaven; Our Jane, Keith, and Heaven) and others are destroyed, and death and madness follow suit for several characters.<br />\\"Dark Angel\\" is the second book in the Casteel series, preceded by \\"Heaven\\" and succeeded by \\"Fallen Hearts\\", \\"Gates of Paradise\\", and \\"Web of Dreams\\". I highly recommend reading all five books in this series. In my opinion, this is the best series V. C. Andrews has created so far. A must-have for all V. C. Andrews fans.	2002-01-24

That is, until she feels the cold presence on the landing upstairs and learns about the house's history. Apparently, there was a mass murder in the house ten years ago; a man killed his wife, three sons, and the family dog--and he was never found. If the freedom of a madman isn't scary enough, the strange, cold presence in her house is enough to scare Kathy stiff. She believes the Winstons' ghosts are listening, waiting... but for what, Kathy doesn't know.<br />What exactly happened on the landing in Kathy's house? And who are the two new strangers in the Colbys' life--the derelict man her mother has hired as a gardener, the scuzzy guy who gives Kathy the creeps; and the curious young boy her 7-year-old brother Timothy has befriended who nobody else can see?<br />\\"The Listeners\\" is a pretty good supernatural teen book. I read it in one sitting without any difficulty. It's very fast-paced and just under 200 pages, ideal for kids. However, the identity of Philip was so obvious to me I doubt other readers will be fooled either, but maybe younger readers will still be surprised at the end. Recommended for children 12 and up.	2002-01-23

And neither is camping out with the strict Mr. Porter in a rustic, secluded cabin near Deep Creek Lake, a place haunted by an old Indian legend. But for most of these students, acing their SATs is crucial for their futures.<br />However, one person has a far more sinister plan for this group--one that results in the mysterious drowning of Brian and the disappearance of their teacher. Is the killer lurking somewhere in the woods, waiting for his/her next victim--or is it someone they all know and suspect: Chris, the steroid-addicted hothead; Angel, the Marilyn Manson ...; Isabel, the new girl who carries a hunting knife; Nathan, the creep who will do anything for money, possibly even kill--or could it be someone even closer to Brian?<br />\\"Crash Course\\" was the first book I ever read by Nicole Davidson and is still my favorite. If you like teen thrillers, then you'll more than likely enjoy this one as much as I did. Highly recommended. Ages 12+	2002-01-22

For the five Sweet Valley High graduates (Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield, Todd Wilkins, Enid Rollins, and Winston Egbert), college is a whole new world filled with endless possibilities. But for Elizabeth, it means disappointment and abandonment. First, her twin sister, Jessica, moves out of their dorm to become roommates with a rich, popular sophomore (Isabella Ricci), who is basically a replacement for Lila Fowler, Jessicas high school friend. Then Elizabeths boyfriend, Todd, starts pressuring her to put out or else. And to top it off, her best friend, Enid (aka Alexandra), doesnt want anything to do with her because of her new image.<br />Then theres Winston, whos stuck in an all-female dorm because of a computer mistake that has him listed as Winnie instead of Winston. For most guys, this would be a dream come true, but for Winston, its a total embarrassment and a major problem since hes trying to impress the Sigmas (a fraternity), and he cant do that with a dorm full of girls calling him Winnie and basically humiliating him.<br />During the whole process of registration and moving in, more than a few students develop mad crushes on each other. Jessica, for one, stirs things up by dating a black student (Danny Wyatt) who has one too many enemies; and then she falls for another guy (Michael McAlley) who she meets by crashing into the back of his sports car. Next to fall in love is Enid/Alexandra, who ends up \\"sleeping\\" with the guy shes just met. And then theres Elizabeth, who is secretly being watched by an admirer.<br />\\"College Girls\\" is the first book in yet another Sweet Valley series: Sweet Valley University. About a handful of the old Sweet Valley crew make appearances, such as Bruce Patman, Steve (the twins older brother), and Lisa Fowler, but it looks like this series will mainly spotlight Elizabeth, Jessica, Enid, Todd, and Winston.

They intend to run a massive experiment on some of the town's troublemakers--Reba Tucker (a high school teacher), Heather Fredericks (a high school student), and Frank Arnold (a refinery worker), just to name a few. Their goal is to \\"realign the minds of the nation's youth\\" by injecting them with pseudo-flu shots that contain mind-controlling transformers. And it's up to three people (Jed Arnold, Judith Sheffield, and Peter Langston) to stop them before they infect the whole town.<br />Although the synopsis on the back of this book pinpoints teenagers as the main victims, there a lot of adults who also receive the shots, primarily ones who work at Borrego Oil and are seen as future problems. So, if you're expecting a teen-oriented book, this is not what you're looking for.<br />\\"Sleepwalk\\" kind of reminded me of Dean Koontz's \\"Midnight\\" in the sense they both took me several months to read, and their plots and book covers resemble each other--a sociopath tries to change the world by experimenting on a small town, and there's a silhouette of a bird on both covers. In my opinion, neither book is worth reading again, even though I'm fans of both Saul and Koontz. This book is excruciatingly slow for about 300 of the 449 pages. The ending does improve, but it's not worth wading through all those pages to get to it. So, unless you're already a fan, I'd skip this one. It's not one of Saul's best.	2002-01-20

By the 6th grade, Leigh is a regular fan. In his letters, Leigh describes his confusion at home over his parent's divorce and being friendless and picked on at his new school. After receiving some tips about writing from Mr. Henshaw, Leigh soon begins his own diary and learns how cathartic writing can be for him. He even wins a writing contest and meets &quot;a real live author&quot; who congratulates him and encourages him to keep writing.<br />It's no wonder &quot;Dear Mr. Henshaw&quot; won the Newbery Award in 1984. Although an entire book devoted to fan letters and diary entries might not excite some younger readers, Mrs. Cleary somehow makes this book very appealing and relative to children. There are also several illustrations done by Paul O. Zelinksy for those who enjoy drawings and not just writing. I remember reading &quot;Dear Mr. Henshaw&quot; when I was a kid and would highly recommend it to other children around seven and up.	2002-01-19

In it, the remaining senior class is haunted and tormented by an evil spirit summoned by one of their own classmates, Josie Maxwell. It's up to her to find a way to reverse the Doom Spell so she and her friends can graduate Shadyside High alive.<br />Meanwhile, Clark Dickson (aka Count Clarkula) shows his true nature as a vampire and seeks blood from the sci-fi nerd, Matty Winger, and the rich Fear descendent, Trisha Conrad. I'm not sure why a vampire had to be added to the plot (although I'm all for vampire stories) when the evil spirit seemed like enough of a threat. I guess I should probably read the other 11 books to find out, especially since--as usual--I've begun a series out of order, starting with the last book first. I wasn't completely lost, however. The yearbook pics at the beginning of the book were useful, but a little distracting. I kept flipping back every so often to find out who each character was, which really wasted a lot of my time while reading the book.<br />Overall, this is your typical Fear Street book. Most teen fans will probably enjoy it, but I thought it was a little too cheesy, even for kids. I mean, a spirit that won't let you graduate high school? Come on. Someone's really getting desperate for material. And it's always a bad sign when a horror book makes you laugh instead of cringe. So, maybe &quot;Graduation Day&quot; will scare younger readers, but I think I've finally outgrown the Fear Street books, even just for fun reading.<br />Recommended for Fear Street fans (age 12+)	2002-01-17

Here a bright, slightly crippled 8-year-old boy (Bentley Ellicott) has been chosen before birth to combat the evil in this world, like so many heroes before him. With him are two friends who will help prepare him for his destiny--Slally Drake, a 7-year-old &quot;mute&quot; girl who is Bentley's rememberer (a person who passes on history to weaken Prince Ombra's power on Earth), and Dr. Dietrich Kreistein, an old German psychologist who teaches Bentley through myths and stories how to defeat Prince Ombra. Out of all the characters in this book, Dr. Kreistein has to be my favorite.<br />As one reviewer on the back of this book wisely put it, Prince Ombra is &quot;a combination of Tolkien and Stephen King&quot;. Although I've never read anything by Tolkien, there is a sense of fantasy and magic in this story. As for King, this book reminded me of Needful Things with the intertwining of small-town life. So, if you're a fan of either writer, then I highly recommend this book. It's a very interesting look at the continuous struggle between good and evil--and the overwhelming power of hope.	2002-01-16

And she's right. During her first day there, she sees a little boy in a sailor suit standing on the pier--and then the next minute he disappears. This is just the first of many appearances the ghost makes, and it's up to Christina to find out why he's still hanging around the old house.<br />When I was younger, this was one of my favorite books, but after rereading it, I was a little disappointed. I had remembered &quot;Christina's Ghost&quot; being a scary ghost story, but it's more of a murder mystery than a horror story. In it, Christina must try to solve a 30-year-old double homicide over some stolen, valuable stamps so the young boy's soul can be put to rest. Not very exciting compared to an evil haunted house, but I don't think younger readers will really mind. Recommended for 9 to 12-year-olds.	2002-01-15

It takes place in the kingdom of Delain where an old king (Roland) rules with his meek wife, Sasha, and two sons (Peter and Thomas). Lurking in the background is the king's evil magician, Flagg, who has been plotting the collapse of this family for years. First to die is Sasha, while giving birth to Thomas. King Roland and Peter succumb within days of each other--Roland dying of poison, and Peter arrested for his death and imprisoned in the top of a tower for the rest of his life. Finally, Flagg has his opportunity to rule vicariously through the youngest son Thomas. However, he never anticipated Peter to come up with such an ingenius plan to stop him, all the while confined to his cell.<br />This is one of the first books I ever read by Stephen King, during my I-won't-read-anything-but-Stephen-King period when I was about 11 or 12. If you're reluctant to read anything by King for whatever reason (either he's too gratuitous or verbose, etc.), at least try \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\". I don't read very many fantasy books, but this is one of the best that I have read. King does such a wonderful job of storytelling that it's hard to put it aside even for sleep. And for those of you who hate reading long books, this one is just under 400 pages (which is unusual for King), with some beautiful illustrations by David Palladini.<br />Out of all King's books, this is still my favorite. I highly recommend it to everyone, not just King fans.	2002-01-13

Now she is preparing to go mainland and attend junior high with the other three island teenagers--14-year-old Michael Jaye and his 15-year-old brother, Benjamin, and beautiful 17-year-old Anya Rothrock. Although Christina is aware of the prejudice mainlanders have for poor, white trash islanders, that's not going to stop her from trying to make new friends, do well in school, and possibly have a boyfriend. That is, until she meets her guardians--Mr. and Mrs. Shevvington--, who also work at Christina's school as the principal and her English teacher. Not only are they sadistic and manipulative, Christina is certain they're trying to play mind games with fragile Anya by fixating on her fear of the ocean. What can Christina do to help her friend? And what will she do next when they decide to focus on Christina instead?<br />I had started this series years ago when I was in middle school, but, even then, I couldn't finish one book. I decided to try them now--more than ten years later--mainly out of curiosity. I wanted to see if I reacted to them the same way.<br />Well, all I can is that I wanted to like &quot;The Fog&quot;; I even got myself psyched up for it. But it just didn't happen. I was expecting a tightly written suspense/horror story, but there's hardly anything fear-inducing in this book. The older teen (Anya Rothrock) who is supposed to be psychologically damaged by the evil principal and his wife was already bonkers to begin with. So no suspense there when her sanity starts to slip. And how or why this couple preys on young women is never thoroughly explained. Maybe--hopefully--that will be discovered in the following two books.<br />The one thing I did like in &quot;The Fog&quot; was the main character, Christina Romney. She was strong and made of &quot;granite&quot;, as she put it--and she would have to be to survive the Shevvingtons.<br />If you're a Caroline B. Cooney fan or a Point horror fan, you might enjoy this trilogy: &quot;The Fog&quot; (#1), &quot;The Snow&quot; (#2), and &quot;The Fire&quot; (#3). However, I'm both and I was still disappointed in this book. I'm hoping the other two books are an improvement over this one.	2002-01-11

Sixteen-year-old Jenny Fowler has just moved to Rimrock with her parents, but she's soon on her own when her parents leave town for a couple weeks on business. In the meantime, Jenny has no problem making new friends and is invited on a scavenger hunt with a few other high school students. However, the event turns near-fatal when one of the teens falls off a cliff and ends up in a coma. Jenny can't believe it was accident, although everyone claims it was; she clearly remembers hearing an argument followed by a scream. Yet when she admits to hearing something, her friends are either skeptical or suspicious. She doesn't know which is worse: not having anyone believe her, or having everyone believe she pushed the girl off the ledge?<br />The incident is then complicated when Jenny starts receiving anonymous phone calls from a secret admirer, while at the same time, being harassed by someone else who wants her dead. Will she ever discover who either stranger is before the threats escalate to murder?<br />If you're a fan of Point thrillers, then you should definitely read this one.

It begins shortly after 12-year-old Ruth has slaughtered and burned several of their family members. She is now free to roam London, searching for an elusive woman nobody remembers (Mrs. Watt, Ruth's nanny) and murdering those who invite her into their home. (Remember, readers: never welcome a vampire into your home unless you intend to have your blood sucked. ;)<br />The Scarabae soon hear about Ruth's heedless killings on the news, and they realize she must be stopped for good. Malach takes the responsibility of locating Ruth, and upon finding her, keeps her as a prisoner until he decides to release her--if he ever chooses to do so.<br />Meanwhile, Rachaela has been seduced by another Scarabae: a beautiful young woman named Althene who has a lot more in common with Rachaela's late father/lover (Adamus) than she realizes. This whole situation is quite shocking, and I should warn you now: if you're offended by incest and/or cross-dressing, then maybe this book isn't for you. But if you could care less or are even more interested, then I highly recommend this book and series--\\"Personal Darkness\\" being the second installment, \\"Dark Dance\\" the first and \\"Darkness, I\\" the third.<br />\\"Personal Darkness\\" was the first book I ever read by Tanith Lee (after being hooked by her writing in a short story, \\"Bite-Me-Not\\", in \\"The Penguin Book of Vampire Stories\\" edited by Alan Ryan) and is still my favorite book in this trilogy. I loved the seemingly randomness of this story, and, of course, I loved the subtle vampire presence. This is definitely a must-read for all gothic vampire-lovers. You'll love it!	2002-01-07

Randy tries to convince her there's nothing going on, but Jana runs away before he can finish--and almost gets hit by a speeding car. Randy quickly saves her by pushing her out of the way, but by doing so, he is hit by the car instead.<br />The two teens are then rushed to the hospital where Randy remains in a coma and Jana recovers from a concussion and a few minor bruises. During her short stay, Jana befriends a young girl (Lisa &quot;the brat&quot; Pratt) who has also been in a car accident. Lisa is enough of a distraction for Jana to forget her own problems; yet Jana still worries Randy may die before she has a chance to make up with him.<br />As best as I can remember, this was one of my favorite Fab Five books among the handful that I did read. It's a little soapy now that I look back on it, but other young girls (around 9-12) will probably like it as much as I did.	2002-01-06

He's a talented computer games writer with a mad crush on Becky, a record store clerk who already has a boyfriend (Ray). While hanging out at Becky's workplace, Mark meets Vincent, a fellow computer games enthusiast, and his live-in girlfriend, Kara. Both are surprisingly interested in Mark's life, especially concerning his relationship (or lack thereof) with Becky. Kara believes Mark should break Becky and Ray up, but he doesn't think he has a right to. So, Kara decides to run interference herself.<br />The plot for the first half of the book reads kind of like a silly teenage drama, but when a sixth character (Frederick) joins the circle, the story begins to get very complicated and weird. (...) I, for one, didn't understand what was going on most of the time, and I won't pretend that I understand it now. I just wanted to get it over with. Very little seemed to happen at the beginning of this book, and then the rest was just an overload of space travel, world annihilation, and just about everything else that bores me. I swear, if little green men had come popping out of a UFO I would have been beating myself senseless with this book.<br />So, as you can tell, my opinion of &quot;See You Later&quot; wasn't so great. And to top it off, I hate sci fi topics, if you hadn't noticed that already. This book certainly wasn't meant for me. Nevertheless, I still consider myself a Christopher Pike fan--of his horror stuff, anyway-- and would only recommend &quot;See You Later&quot; to other die-hard Pike fans or people who are really into science fiction. Otherwise, skip this one and try something else, like &quot;Remember Me&quot; (one of my favorites).	2002-01-05

Most of his peers don't make it easy for him, especially Jake McRoyan, Wade's younger brother. He still blames Lucas for killing his brother (although it wasn't intentional), and he expects his other friends to feel the same way. And everyone does--except Zoey Passmore (Jake's girlfriend), who can't help but feel sorry for Lucas, while at the same time developing a mad crush on him.<br />I just started this series (either called Boyfriends and Girlfriends or Making Out, depending on which edition you're reading) and am fairly impressed with the first book so far. The whole Lucas-Zoey-Jake love triangle wasn't too terribly exciting--I mean, you pretty much know Zoey is going to fall for Lucas from the first chapter--, but, at least, it wasn't too cheesy either. The best part of the book, I thought, was the back story of the fatal car wreck. I wished that had been the main plot--there were enough details and twists to make this into a great teen thriller--, but I guess that's not the type of book/series this is. Too bad.<br />I did enjoy the occasional maps, journal entries, and lists from each character. And, at the end of &quot;Zoey Fools Around&quot;, there's a short multiple choice quiz to test your long or short-term love IQ. I scored pretty poorly. Better luck next time, right?. :)<br />Recommended for 12+ year-old girls.

Series	Along with two of her new friends (Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Bridges and Carolyn &quot;Carrie&quot; Alden), eighteen-year-old Emma Cresswell has been hired as an au pair on Sunset Island, a tiny island off the coast of Maine where the rich and famous like to vacation. Emma is excited about her new job, and not just because its her first one. This her big chance to create a &quot;normal&quot; life for herself. Having been born into wealth, Emma would never have to work a day in her life, but she doesnt feel comfortable with that kind of lifestyle anymore. By coming to Sunset Island, she hopes she can shed her ice princess image and become a typical middle-class girl. Yet thats easier said than done. Her secret barely survives a week when one event after another threatens to expose her--a girl on the island (Lorell Courtland) recognizes Emma as part of the &quot;in&quot; crowd, and then, her mothers promiscuous artist boyfriend (Austin Payne) shows up at the island unannounced. How long before Emmas big secret is exposed? And if her friends and boyfriend (Kurt Ackerman) find out, will they still be supportive--or will they turn their backs on her?<br />&quot;Sunset Island&quot; is the first book in this series, followed by a couple dozen other Sunset... books, including a spin-off series called Club Sunset Island. If youre a fan of Francine Pascals Sweet Valley High series, then youll probably enjoy this series. In my opinion, theyre a little better than SVH. Recommended for 12+ year-old girls.	2002-01-01

There's not enough in this story to really make a 400-page novel--but it's still very good. Maybe the best part of it is that I can boast about reading a Dean Koontz book in one day. I mean, it's 150 pages. Most anyone can do the same.<br />The basic idea of the book is a computer with a God complex holds a young woman (Susan Harris) captive in her own home by controlling her computer system that runs throughout her house. He then plans to use Susan as a \\"host\\" so he can be born into human form. The whole idea is disturbing and mesmerizing. Perhaps that's why I liked \\"Demon Seed\\" so much.<br />After being made into a movie in 1977 (which I haven't seen, but plan to), \\"Demon Seed\\" was revised into the current edition you're looking at right now. I never read the original version, but in the afterwards of this book, Dean Koontz claimed it was so bad that it caused him to \\"develop the squint-eyed look of Clint Eastwood\\" from wincing so much. Well, I can't say the book is that bad now--although it's still not one of his best books. But if you're a Koontz fan, then you should definitely give this one a try.	2002-01-01
1715462:US	50720905	RPN8RMETBWYLY	0345384466	470794658	The Witching Hour (Lives of Mayfair Witches)	Books	5	6	8	N	N	The First Book in the Lives of the Mayfair Witches Trilogy	&quot;The Witching Hour&quot; begins in New Orleans, Louisiana, at the First Street mansion in the Garden District. Here the twelfth Mayfair witch, Deirdre, remains in a catatonic state until her death shortly into the book. Her adult daughter, Rowan (the thirteenth and most powerful witch), never knew she was adopted until she is notified of Deirdre's death and invited to the funeral. Accompanied by her soon-to-be-husband (Michael Curry), Rowan enters the chaotic world of the Mayfairs, which is haunted by a very powerful entity: Lasher.<br />About one-third of the book is a case file of the Mayfair family kept by the Talamasca (a secret organization investigating paranormal activity). The file is given to Rowan by Aaron Lightner (a Talamasca agent) in the hopes she would resist Lasher's devious plan to become human. This section of the book is quite detail-oriented and lengthy (and some readers may find it unnecessary), but I absolutely loved it. It covers over three centuries of the Mayfair witches' lives--from the invocation of Lasher in Scotland to the witch burnings shortly after; from the migration to New Orleans to the creation of the First Street house. (FYI: the Mayfair mansion on First Street was mirrored after Anne Rice's own home.) Each witch is described so clearly and thoroughly in the book, you'll certainly grow attached to one or more of the characters. My favorites were Mary Beth, Stella, and Rowan.<br />In total, this book reaches over 1000 pages--quite a feat for any reader, especially if this is your first Anne Rice book. It was my first, and I've been addicted to this series ever since. I highly recommend reading it. One warning though: there is quite a bit of incest. So, if you're offended by this, you might try something else by Rice, like The Vampire Chronicles.<br />&quot;The Witching Hour&quot; is the beginning novel in the Lives of the Mayfair Witches trilogy (my favorite series by Anne Rice). It's followed by &quot;Lasher&quot; and &quot;Taltos&quot;.<br />If you enjoyed the Mayfair series, then I would recommend Tanith Lee's Blood Opera Sequence series: &quot;Dark Dance&quot;, &quot;Personal Darkness&quot;, and &quot;Darkness, I&quot;. Basically, it's about a small family of incestuous vampires. So, if you're a fan of Anne Rice's vampires and witches, you might like these books.	2001-12-30
1718602:US	50720905	R1060F78SLGLOL	0440223016	691063546	A Long Fatal Love Chase	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Melodramatic, But Still Worth Reading	The title of this book clearly states the plot: an 18-year-old young woman (Rosamond Vivian) is stalked for several years by her 35-year-old ex-lover (Phillip Tempest). The story begins on a tiny island in an unknown region (England, possibly), travels halfway through Europe--from Italy to France, to name a few places--, then comes full-circle back to England(?) for the dramatic ending (which was a little disappointing, I thought). On more than one occasion, I found myself snickering at how cheesy the book was, but for an &quot;old classic&quot;, it was pretty entertaining and shocking, especially with the type of conflict not usually seen in Alcott's work, such as bigamy, divorce, and murder--all committed by Phillip with the help of his evil servant (Baptiste), including the murder of Phillip's own son, Lito.<br />The book was written in August and September of 1866 and mirrored a lot of the places Alcott saw while visiting Europe in 1865. Unfortunately, &quot;A Long Fatal Love Chase&quot; was not published until over a century later, rejected for being &quot;too long and too sensational&quot;--which, in truth, it is. The editor, Kent Bicknell, took the chore of deciphering Alcott's messy handwriting and finished the book for print in the late 1990s, leaving as much of the original story intact. Overall, it turned out pretty well. I would highly recommend this book to Louisa May Alcott fans or fans of historical, romantic fiction.	2001-12-27

She taught herself to read and speak before she was four-years-old--all without the help of her lazy, ignorant parents or older brother, Michael--and goes on to develop telekinetic abilities. Her teacher, Miss Jennifer Honey, is impressed with Matilda's accomplishments, and with further tutoring, she helps the young girl master her spectacular gift. This gift later becomes useful when Matilda decides to save Crunchem Hall Primary School from the sadistic Headmistress, Miss Agatha Trunchbull, and free her favorite teacher (Miss Honey) from poverty.<br />Like all of Roald Dahl's books, this was a breeze and delight to read, filled with lots of mature humor and fun games. The book was made into a movie in 1996, and although I never saw it, I'd encourage anyone who plans to watch it to read the book first. Generally, Dahl's books outshine the movie version. Highly recommended for 8 to 12+ year-olds.	2001-12-27

Series	Jim Qwilleran has just been hired as an art writer for the Daily Fluxion, a position he's unqualified for and reluctant to take. His first assignment is to interview Cal Halapay, a successful commercial artist who has no interest in answering any of Jim's questions. The only time Cal reacts is when he voices his contempt for George Bonifield Mountclemens III, the art critic for the same newspaper Jim works for. As Jim continues learning about art and befriending artists and gallery owners, he discovers Cal isn't the only one who hates George; several other people (mostly artists) consider the heartless critic better off dead. Yet when Jim meets the man, he's charmed by George's sophistication--not to mention his characteristic Siamese cat, Kao K'o-Kung (aka Koko)--and agrees to rent the bottom apartment to George's Victorian home. However,  the art recluse harbors one too many secrets, ones that will lead to murder, including his own. With the help of Koko, Jim tries to uncover the link between George's death and the two other murders in the art community.<br />Although this is a pretty good book, I was a little disappointed that Koko didn't show up earlier. I suppose since this is the first book in The Cat Who... series, the author didn't want to rush character introductions, but I hope Koko's more in the spotlight in the following books. Still, this is a great series for animal and mystery lovers.	2001-12-25

Valdier killed the parents of the household and made two of the three children into vampires: Dillon and Xander Adler. Out of guilt, the Old Celt and his family &quot;adopted&quot; the children and moved far away from Valdier. They came to Pennsylvania where the story begins.<br />Tucker Burton is the 12-year-old protagonist in &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;. He's captivated by the Irish Gypsies that have come to work on his family's farm. The day that he sees shy, timid Lilly, Tucker follows her and the Kellums home, which happens to be in the Scavengers' Woods, a very dangerous and eerie place. He then witnesses something that is completely unbelievable--the Kellums produce two coffins that are inhabited by twin vampires, Dillon and Xander. One of them (Xander) is nearing his vampire state, while the other (Dillon) struggles to delay the inevitable. With the help of Tucker, the Kellums plan to protect the twin vampire brothers from ever being discovered by humans, or worse--Valdier.<br />&quot;Blood Brothers&quot; is one of the few vampire books for kids that is really exciting to read whether you're a child or not. Many of the vampire myths are the same in the book--sunshine will burn a vampire's skin, they sleep in coffins during the day, etc.--, but Jill Morgan adds some interesting twists, such as a time lapse between being bitten by a vampire and finally entering vampiredom, and the ability to shapeshift into a wolf or vanish into air.<br />Since I really enjoy vampire stories, I can't help but praise this book. The reading level is for 8 to 12-year-olds, but I would still encourage older readers who share my interest to pick this one up. It's well worth your time.	2001-12-22
1724060:US	50720905	RDERY5CDZUVJC	0375700528	400024285	The Lover	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Spare, Free-Floating	\\"The Lover\\" is a brief account of a poor 15½-year-old French girl's mismatched relationship with a wealthy older Chinese man. The story takes place in Southeast Asia during the 1930s. The two lovers meet on a ferry boat crossing the Mekong River. He offers to drive her to her boarding school in Saigon; she accepts; and their troubled affair follows shortly after, pitted with social obstacles over race, class, and age.<br />The book is very sparely written with just over 100 pages and virtually no dialogue. The story jumps around quite a bit too. On one page, the young narrator will be describing the future of her family; in the next, she will be reminiscing over her Chinese lover. Her writing style is best suited for readers who like short, free-floating stories.<br />I read \\"The Lover\\" in my sophomore year of high school, and it's still one of my favorite books. I saw the movie several years later, and that too has become one of my favorites. I highly recommend watching it after reading the book. It's absolutely beautiful.	2001-12-21
1725611:US	50720905	R1262WYFJIVPKE	0821748785	338601104	Witch Hunt	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Time-Travel Back to the Witch Trials	Taking place in June of 1963, &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; is about the mysterious past of an old Massachusetts home Abbey Harmon and her family have inherited. Apparently, the young woman (Felicity Crane) who lived there in the late 1600s was tried and killed as a witch. Felicity's boyfriend, Zachariah Wellbourne, knew of her powers, especially of the hidden closet in her house that allowed her to travel forward in time. That is how he is able to appear in 1963. But now he's stuck in the 20th century and unable to stop the fate that awaits Felicity--unless Abbey will help him.<br />There are no ghosts in &quot;Witch Hunt&quot;, rather the past comes back to haunt Abbey via time travel instead of through supernatural means, a much more interesting method than if the author had settled for a typical story about a wronged witch. Another different point in the book is the way it's written: entirely in the present tense. I can't say that I really liked that since I'm used to past-tense writing. It was too distracting, but this is still a pretty good teen book.	2001-12-20

While Tim is very excited about opening night, Nikki can barely hide her stage fright. Brittany Tate, a reporter for the &quot;Record&quot; (their high school newspaper), picks up on their different reactions to the play and exaggerates on Tim's friendship with a fellow drama student, Lara Bennett, in the hopes that Tim and Nikki will break up and he'll then fall for Britanny.<br />When she's not destroying other people's relationships, Brittany is secretly working as a waitress in a disgusting restaurant so she can earn enough money to pay her dues at the country club. Surprisingly, another classmate is also working at the same place: Jeremy Pratt, a rich snob who's gone into debt because of his new high-maintenance girlfriend Kim Bishop, Brittany's close friend.<br />Although River Heights is written under Carolyn Keene's name, don't expect much suspense in this series. All it shares with Nancy Drew is her next-door neighbor, Nikki Masters, and her hometown locale, River Heights. These books are better suited for fans of Francine Pascal's Sweet Valley High series than fans of Nancy Drew.	2001-12-16

She believes the old woman is an evil witch who flies around on her broom at night and casts spells on everyone. During her weekend stay with her father, Karen vows to expose the witch, even though she's forbidden to spy on the neighbors, especially Morbidda. Of course, Karen doesn't obey rules, which consequently allows her to overhear Morbidda discussing an upcoming witch meeting with her black cat, Midnight. With the help of her best friend (Hannie Papadakis), Karen sets out to sabotage the meeting and save Stoneybrook from a coven of witches.<br />&quot;Karen's Witch&quot; is the first book in the Baby-sitters Little Sister series, a spin-off of The Baby-sitters Club series. These books are geared more for younger readers (age 7 - 9) and follows one imaginative little girl, Karen Brewer, Kristy Thomas's younger stepsister.	2001-12-10

Victoria \\"Vix\\" Leonard, a 24-year-old Harvard graduate, receives a surprising call from her estranged best friend, Caitlin Somers: Caitlin is getting married at the end of July, and she wants Vix to be the Maid of Honor. Furthermore, she's engaged to Bru, Vix's old boyfriend. Despite the shock, Vix agrees to be there.<br />Then the story flashes back to 1977-1980, when these two girls became \\"summer sisters\\". Vix was an awkward, shy sixth-grader when Caitlin chose her out of all the other students and invited her to Martha's Vineyard for the summer. During those three years, Vix matures tremendously, and with the start of puberty, most of her experiences are sexual--either with Caitlin or her first boyfriend, Bru. If you hadn't guessed, Vix and Caitlin's friendship borders on the lesbian side. I mean, how many best friends count each other's pubic hairs? (Please don't reply; I don't really want to know. :)<br />The book continues on through the 80s and 90s like that, feeling like one long summer vacation. (If you had one, you'll most likely reflect on your own summer fling(s).) While Vix is the main character in the book, several other characters share their opinions in a few brief chapters, such as my two favorites: Lamb, Caitlin's endearing hippie father, and Sharkey, Caitlin's introverted older brother.<br />So far, this is Judy Blume's longest book, reaching almost 400 pages, but it's hardly wordy. She always has a knack for writing concise stories that expand and stick in your mind. This is mainly why I love reading anything by Judy Blume. She is an absolutely talented storyteller.<br />Now, although \\"Summer Sisters\\" is a fantastic book, it's not one of my favorites. I guess I had a hard time feeling anything for Vix's friend, Caitlin. On one hand, she did get Vix out of her shell, but on the other... well, she was just a terrible friend. She was too competitive and jealous, and Vix deserved better. So, when Caitlin departs (for lack of a better term) in the end, I was very relieved. It was an appropriate ending for a much-hated character.<br />Despite that, I would still recommend this book. \\"Summer Sisters\\" was definitely refreshing, and made me wish Judy Blume would write more \\"adult\\" novels like this or her other two, \\"Smart Women\\" and \\"Wifey\\".	2001-12-08

That last task proves to be the hardest of all because, although they're twins, neither Elizabeth or Jessica have a clue what the other wants. Jessica buys her sister a blue velvet bow because it looks great on herself, and Elizabeth gets Jess a toy car because it's what she would like to receive herself.

And, luckily, her wish comes true in &quot;Runaway Hamster&quot;.<br />Unlike her twin, Jessica can't stand the &quot;ugly rat&quot;. She refuses to help in any way, but her mother insists the hamster is half Jessica's responsibility. Reluctantly, Jessica takes care of the pet, but she is soon distracted by her older brother, and Tinkerbell escapes the unattended cage, quickly vanishing somewhere in the Wakefield's home.<br />As a replacement for Tinkerbell, Elizabeth and Jessica buy another hamster, Thumbelina. But the twins can't help but wonder what happened to their first class pet.<br />This was one of my favorite SVK books growing up because I had a hamster who ran away as well. Unfortunately, I never found her, but at least this book has a happier ending.<br />If you like hamsters (and you're about 5 to 8-years-old), you'll probably like this second book in the Sweet Valley Kids series.	2001-12-03

He's very popular, good-looking, and is now going steady with the beautiful senior, Leah Pennington. But all that changes when Duncan &quot;Doomed&quot; Stein, a gangly, homely loner, moves to Cayuta, New York. At first, he doesn't seem a threat to anyone, least of all Alan. But that's before he publishes his own newspaper, &quot;Remote&quot;, and attracts all the &quot;lonely hearts&quot; at the high school with the anonymous dating ads. Soon everyone at Cayuta High is no longer interested in going steady with each other, but trying to find a more meaningful alternative to love. Alan and Leah, being the ideal couple, seem immune to this fad, until Alan reads the the love letter Doomed has given Leah. Then nothing makes sense to Alan anymore. Besides losing his girlfriend to the biggest dork in school, he has to struggle with the sudden reappearance of his deadbeat father, the crush he has on Doomed's beautiful mother, and the secret affair she has with Alan's football coach.<br />Although this book is geared more towards teens, it might be a little too deep for some younger readers. At least, when I was that age, I wasn't puzzling over the mysteries of love. But if you like teen stories that are more intellectual than most, then you might give this one a try.	2001-12-02

Her main assignment in 'A' is for Alibi is to discover who killed Laurence Fife, an influential divorce lawyer with firsthand experience in wrecking marriages. His last wife, Nikki Fife, was found guilty eight years ago of slipping oleander in his antihistamine pills. Now free, Nikki contacts Kinsey and asks her to find the real killer.<br />The suspects range from Laurence's close friend and associate (and Kinsey's new lover), Charlie Scorsoni, to his &quot;bitter&quot; first wife Gwen. But whoever the killer is, Laurence wasn't the last victim. Four days after he died, a young accountant (Libby Glass) was found dead in her bathroom, apparently drugged with the same poison. Yet Libby's death was never connected to Laurence's, although it was rumored they were intimately involved.<br />Another woman is later killed during Kinsey's investigation, leading Kinsey to conclude she might be next. How close can Kinsey get to uncovering the truth without risking her own life?<br />'A' is for Alibi is the first book I've read so far by Sue Grafton, and it certainly won't be my last. Kinsey is definitely a likable character--rough and smart--, and the plot is entertaining enough for any mystery buff.

Andrews. It begins in the Willies, a mountain range in West Virginia. This is where Heaven Leigh Casteel has grown up in poverty for the past ten years, along with her four siblings (Tom, Fanny, Keith, and Our Jane), father and stepmother (Luke and Sarah), and grandparents. All nine family members share a pitiful cabin high above the small town of Winnerrow.<br />One night, Heaven's grandmother takes her to the grave site of her real mother (Leigh VanVoreen, aka &quot;Angel&quot;), who had died shortly after giving birth to her. Leigh has always remained a mystery to Heaven (in fact, Heaven never knew she had a different mother other than Sarah), until her grandmother gives her Leigh's suitcase, which is filled with expensive items from her mother's previous life in Boston.<br />After that revelation, Heaven vows to never confess her birth right to anyone, especially her siblings, who she wants to keep protected. She has a pretty good relationship with all of them, except for her younger sister, Fanny, who has always been a thorn in her side. Fanny's extremely jealous of her half-sister and basically makes Heaven's life hell. She even tries repeatedly to come between Heaven and her new boyfriend, Logan Stonewall (the son of a well-to-do pharmacist), but without any success.<br />Even though their life is pretty pathetic so far, Heaven and her siblings receive one shock after another when their grandmother dies, and then Sarah (their stepmother) runs away after giving birth to a stillborn baby, which she believes was the result of Luke's infidelity. The biggest blow of all comes shortly after Sarah leaves, around Christmas time. Luke surprises everyone with an unthinkable Christmas present that will supposedly benefit the entire family: he intends to sell all five of his children for $500 a piece. Keith and Our Jane are the first to be &quot;adopted&quot;. Fanny is next, taken in by Reverend Wayland Wise and his wife; then Tom, to a demanding farmer; and finally, Heaven, sold to an ex-lover of her father's (Kitty Dennison) and her submissive husband (Calhoun). Yet Cal is hardly a decent father. He would rather be Heaven's first lover than a role model. And Kitty isn't innocent of abuse either. She degrades Heaven with chemical baths and even turns her into a present-day Cinderella.<br />As expected in all of V. C. Andrews' books, Heaven's life is full of trauma and secrets. But her story certainly doesn't end here. It continues with &quot;Dark Angel&quot; and &quot;Fallen Hearts&quot;, then &quot;Gates of Paradise&quot; and &quot;Web of Dreams&quot;, the two separate stories of her daughter (Annie) and her mother (Leigh). I highly recommend this book, as well as the four other books in the Casteel series.	2001-11-26

She tries to coax him out of his tree house with a snake, but he recognizes her as a witch by her gloves and purple-tinted eyes and refuses to leave.<br />The second time he meets a witch (actually, several witches), he isn't so lucky. This happens when he and his grandmother go to the Hotel Magnificent in Bournemouth so his grandmother can recover from pneumonia. The hotel they stay in is also the meeting place of several other English witches who are masquerading as members of the RSPCC (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Children). Leading the convention is the Grand High Witch, the most evil and powerful witch alive.<br />The young boy accidentally overhears the entire meeting of the witches and their terrible plan to exterminate all the children in the world by poisoning their candy. He even witnesses their mouse-transforming experiment on a young boy named Bruno Jenkins. And before the meeting ends, he's discovered and changed into a mouse as well.<br />Although they're hopelessly small to physically stop the witches, they aim to outwit them with the help of the boy's grandmother--and a stolen bottle of Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-Maker.<br />This was the first book by Roald Dahl I ever read and is still my favorite. I remember reading it dozens of times when I was a kid; it was that good. I highly recommend it to all 8 to 12-year-olds.<br />I saw the movie several years later and thought it was all right, but not as good as the book. The movie's ending was too happy-ever-after, not that the book's ending was any better though. (It felt like there should be a sequel.) Nevertheless, I would still recommend the movie--right after you read the book, of course.	2001-11-25

Her current list is a two-columned page of everything she hates and loves. Some things can change sporadically from one column to the next--like her parents, babies (especially the one her parents are expecting; the same one she's nicknamed One-Ball Reilly), her name, her friends, and Washburn Cummings (the troublemaker she has a crush on)--, but others (like liver) remain the same: in the hate category.<br />This is a great book for 9 to 12-year-old girls. If you liked this one, don't miss any of the other Anastasia books: Anastasia Again!; Anastasia at Your Service; Anastasia Has the Answers; Anastasia on Her Own; Anastasia's Chosen Career; Anastasia, Ask Your Analyst; Anastasia at This Address; and Anastasia, Absolutely.	2001-11-24

Janie Johnson (aka Jennie Spring) is now a junior in high school (still in Connecticut), and Reeve Shields, her boyfriend, is a freshman at Hills College in Boston, Massachusetts. He's also the main character in this book.<br />The book starts out on Reeve's first day of hosting a one-hour talk program on the college campus radio, WSCK. He's extremely nervous and has no material to speak of--until he flashes on his girlfriend's traumatic past. For an hour, Reeve retells Janie's discovery of the missing children's ad on the side of the milk carton, realizing it was a picture of herself, and that she had been kidnapped over twelve years ago. From then on, Reeve has an immediate and devoted audience. They want to know everything that happened to Janie, but how far will Reeve go to maintain his popularity and status?<br />Meanwhile, Jodie Spring (Janie's biological older sister) is planning a weekend trip to Boston to scout-out potential colleges. She invites Janie and Brian (one of their younger twin brothers) along for the ride, but all three get more than they bargained for when they tune in to Reeve's secretive radio show. Needless to say, they're all shocked and horrified by what he's done. How could he do this to them, especially Janie? More importantly, how can they forgive him for exposing their family's secret so publicly? And what about that mysterious caller who claimed to be Hannah Javensen, Janie's kidnapper?<br />Just as gripping as the previous two books in this series (&quot;The Face on the Milk Carton&quot; and &quot;Whatever Happened to Janie?&quot;), &quot;The Voice on the Radio&quot; definitely doesn't disappoint. It leaves you wanting more, and, thankfully, there is another book after this one: &quot;What Janie Found&quot;. This series could go on and on forever, and I would still be reading every book too. They're very addictive.<br />While this series is geared toward teen girls, I would still recommend it to anyone interested. It's well worth your time if you like true-to-life stories.	2001-11-23

Sara Louise &quot;Wheeze&quot; Bradshaw is the young teen who narrates the story. She's forever feeling inferior next to her beautiful, talented twin sister, Caroline. And she's conflicted by her &quot;sinful&quot; feelings for the 70+ year-old stranger, Hiram &quot;the Captain&quot; Wallace, who's returned to his hometown half a century later. Without anyone to confide in (even her one and only friend, McCall &quot;Call&quot; Purnell, doesn't understand her), Louise feels as isolated as the island she lives on. Her fate seems to be filled with misery and loneliness compared to her sister's, especially after her religious grandmother spitefully recites a passage from the Bible: &quot;Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated&quot;. (Jacob and Esau were twins like Louise and Caroline--and like Esau, Louise was the least favorite twin.)<br />I had a hard time starting this book. The beginning was a little rough, but once I started it, I couldn't put it down. I read half the book in one sitting, until I reached the part where Louise, Cal, and the Captain were preparing to drown more than a dozen cats--which were pets, by the way, not just strays. I was totally turned off by this, but when I read further, the cats were spared and adopted by various families on the island. (Ironically, a storm later wiped a lot of them out.)<br />The book won the Newbery Medal in 1981 and was later made into a TV movie in 1989. I never saw the movie, but I would definitely recommend this book to 13+ year-old girls who can relate to Louise and/or love the East Coast, particularly the Chesapeake Bay area.	2001-11-20

It pretty much illustrates life in Four Bee, the domed city where the nameless protagonist and her circle of Jang (teenage) friends live. (She might have a name, but I don't recall ever seeing it.) Here you can assume any gender or body just by \\"suiciding\\". Nothing's taboo in Four Bee--well, almost nothing. Murder, for one, is against the rules--and if it's forbidden, then this daring Jang will certainly find a way of committing it (...).<br />There are a few other no-no's besides murder in Four Bee. For starters, you can only kill yourself so many times before you're put on \\"probation\\". (Poor Hergal.) Just like in our own society today, teenage pregnancy, casual sex, and even May/December romances are frowned upon. After awhile, Four Bee doesn't seem like such a hedonistic place; it feels more like a prison or a bubbled cage.<br />If you like Tanith Lee's writing style (and especially her sci fi novels), then I would recommend this book. But I wouldn't recommend the sequel, \\"Drinking Sapphire Wine\\"; it's not as good as this one.<br />You can find these two novellas (\\"Don't Bite the Sun\\" and \\"Drinking Sapphire Wine\\") in one complete edition: \\"Biting the Sun\\".	2001-11-20

I think this sequel really put a damper on the whole storyline. That's mainly why I gave it a 2 / 5 score.<br />I would certainly recommend the first book (&quot;Don't Bite the Sun&quot;) over this one. But if you liked this book, then I would recommend the combined edition of these two novellas: &quot;Biting the Sun&quot;.<br />If you're looking for a really good sci fi novel, though, then I would highly recommend &quot;The Silver Metal Lover&quot; by the same author, which is one of the best books I have ever read.	2001-11-20

The story begins in 1900 with the Fear mansion burning to the ground, killing everyone inside. Nora Goode is the only survivor, but she witnesses a horrible image through the window of the house--a young woman is tied to a stake and burned alive.<br />The book quickly flashes back to 1692 in Wickham Village, Massachusetts Colony, where the latter young woman lives with her family. She is 16-year-old Susannah Goode, and she's in love with Edward Fier. However, his family forbids him to marry a poor girl like Susannah. To prevent them from eloping, Edward's father accuses Susannah of witchcraft, along with her mother.<br />Yet before their death sentences are carried out, they're given one last glimmer of hope. Edward's uncle promises to arrange for their release if Susannah's father will pay for their freedom. Of course he does, but when the next day arrives, his daughter and wife are still burned. Apparently, the Fiers had fled the town that night after robbing everybody in it. Vowing to avenge his family's death, he invokes the Evil One (ironically, he was the one practicing black magic, not his daughter and wife) and sets out to create a vendetta between the Goodes and Fiers.<br />I highly recommend this book to Fear Street fans. Once you've read &quot;The Betrayal&quot;, you'll definitely want to finish this saga out with &quot;The Secret&quot; and &quot;The Burning&quot;.	2001-11-17

Stella Raphael is the straying spouse, married to a fairly successful forensic psychiatrist, Max Raphael. She meets her soon-to-be lover, Edgar Stark, when she moves with her husband and 10-year-old son (Charlie) to a nearby mental hospital, where her husband has accepted a job as deputy superintendent. Edgar is hired to reconstruct the Raphael's run-down conservatory, but finds more interest in seducing the doctor's wife instead. What follows is a tangled web of madness and murder that will hook you until the very last page.<br />I read &quot;Asylum&quot; during my senior year in high school, and it's still one of my favorite \\"obsession\\" books. I highly recommend it if you like psychological, erotic novels. The only complaint I have about this book is the viewpoint of Dr. Cleave. He wasn't a very necessary character. Other than that, I thought this book was great. I also recommend &quot;Damage&quot; by Josephine Hart if you like sexual obsession. (...)	2001-11-15

For starters, he sounds like a total nerd from his letter--he loves math and foreign languages and doesn't waste his time on entertainment since he's always studying. Plus, he's a little odd-looking with his bald, misshapen head and big ears.<br />Yet when the family picks him up from the airport, he doesn't look anything like his picture; he's much more attractive. He also isn't interested in any of the subjects he mentioned before in his letter. In fact, he's terrible in school, loves to smoke and watch TV, and can barely speak English well. He's also extremely superstitious.<br />When Dominic, Julie's 11-year-old brother, builds a spirit house for Bia (the exchange student's nickname), a lot of weird things start to happen. And they all lead back to Bia. What horrible secret is he hiding, and why has Julie's luck turned bad ever since he's arrived?<br />&quot;The Spirit House&quot; is a pretty good book for teens. It's very short (134 pages), which will probably appeal to more lax readers. As for the supernatural element in the book, it wasn't very suspenseful. The story is more about superstitions than evidence of any evil spirit. The cryptic ending is also ok, but not very satisfying. However, if you're 12+ years-old and like supernatural mysteries, you'll probably really like this one.	2001-11-14

But Mark's completely addicted and starts up again, mainly as a way to meet girls.<br />Unfortunately, someone else also has the same idea as Mark, except the mystery caller kidnaps the girls he meets. With the help of his new girlfriend (Janine, who he met on the party line), Mark sets out to trap the kidnapper by using Janine as bait. Although risky, the plan works as expected--but maybe a little too well, because now Janine's the next possible victim.<br />The beginning of &quot;Party Line&quot; is pretty slow and boring with Mark struggling to meet girls and, once successful, trying to balance two relationships at the same time--one with Janine and another with a classmate, Marcy. However, by the end, the pace definitely picks up and makes the earlier monotony somewhat forgivable. Another plus: the identity of the kidnapper is well-hidden until the last chapter. You probably won't be able to guess him beforehand; I certainly couldn't.<br />Although written years before Internet chat rooms became popular, &quot;Party Line&quot; pretty much captures the same games and danger associated with anonymous dating. Worth reading if you like teen thrillers.	2001-11-13

The story begins in 1957 when William &quot;Stuttering Bill&quot; Denbrough's younger brother, George, is killed by a clown in a rain gutter. His death is the first of many that will plague Derry for generations, but it's the one that will haunt Bill forever.<br />More than twenty-five years later, the pattern is being repeated--children are disappearing and occasionally found dead, brutally murdered--and one concerned citizen (Mike Hanlon) vows to put an end to it. He's responsible for contacting his six childhood friends (Bill Denbrough, Stanley Uris, Richard Tozier, Ben Hanscom, Eddie Kaspbrak, and Beverly Marsh-Rogan) and reminding them of the promise they had made together as children--to destroy IT if it were to reawaken. And it has.<br />Although the story is set in 1985, all seven friends continuously flashback on their childhood before/while/after confronting IT. The memory segments take up a great deal of the book, but I'm glad they weren't removed. Anyhow, Stephen King and brevity have never gone hand-in-hand.<br />If you're willing to read 1,000+ pages, then I highly recommend this book. It's well worth your time. But if not, I'd recommend the TV movie instead; that is, if you don't mind watching a three-hour movie. Either way, you'll be spending a considerable amount of time being scared.<br />My choice was the book. I read &quot;It&quot; back in middle school ('90 or '91), but I wouldn't necessarily encourage younger (or more sensitive) readers to try this one unless you're already familiar with Stephen King or horror novels. There is plenty of gore, profanity, and sex--everything typical of King--that might offend some people. So, consider yourself warned.	2001-11-12

The unicorn is soon released, however, by Schmendrick the Magician, Mommy Fortuna's hapless assistant. Together they continue the journey until they meet their third companion, Molly Grue.<br />The threesome then approach Hagsgate, the pitiful town owned by King Haggard--who lives a short distance farther in his cliff-side castle with his adopted son, Prince Lir. But before they have a chance to enter the castle, they're attacked by the Red Bull, who has come to collect the last unicorn. In an unexpected turn of events, Schmendrick transforms the trapped unicorn into a beautiful young woman (Lady Amalthea). The sudden change fools the Red Bull and protects her for the time being--just until they can search the castle for the other missing unicorns.<br />&quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; is one of my all-time favorite books. I saw the animated movie first when I was very young--shortly after it was released in 1982-- and later decided to read the book when I was about 9 or 10. Although the book is fantastic, I though the movie's ending was much better than the book's. There are a few other things I prefer in the movie, but I still really love the book. I highly recommend both to anyone who loves unicorns.	2001-11-11

It's on this first flight that she accidentally reunites with her ex-husband (Seth Brody), who just happens to be the pilot. There's some definite tension and unresolved issues between the two--after all, she had left him three years ago because of his career change and the risks involved with it--, but there's also a glimmer of reconciliation.<br />However, before they have a chance to talk, the small airplane malfunctions and crashes into the snowy mountains below. Miraculously, almost all of the other eight passengers survive, except for one FBI agent who was chaperoning a serial killer on the trip. Now the killer has escaped into the woods, and the rest are just trying to stave off hunger, wounds, and the cold.<br />This is the first Harlequin book I have ever read, and being somewhat cautious of sappy romance novels, I had my doubts about starting this one. However, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. The romance wasn't excessive and mushy, plus the ending had a great twist. I do have a few complaints though. For starters, I was pretty disappointed when Elizabeth and Seth sneak off for a make-out session just mere seconds after being shot at by the serial killer. I mean, how did they know the killer wouldn't return and finish the job? Final flaw: after about the third death (and, believe me, there are more than three deaths), the rest were just anticlimactic page-fillers. I probably would have rated this book lower if the ending hadn't improved.<br />So, final thought: romance/suspense fans should definitely love this one. As for me, I was fairly impressed, but I haven't become a romance addict because of it.	2001-11-09

And the count and countess certainly have no limits to how far they will go sexually. Homophobics beware.<br />I read &quot;The Kiss&quot; way back in high school ('96 or '97), and it's still one of my absolute favorites. If you like vampires, sex, and the 1930s, then I highly recommend you read this book. You won't be disappointed.

First, Kristy has to organize the members: Mary Anne Spier, her best friend; Claudia Kishi, a fellow classmate at Stoneybrook Middle School; and Claudia's new friend, Stacey McGill. Second, they advertise in the local newspaper and distribute fliers. Now all they have to do is wait for the calls.<br />On their first meeting day, all four baby-sitters miraculously receive jobs for the week. Stacey baby-sits for Kristy's younger brother, David Michael, and falls for Kristy's older brother, Sam. Kristy unknowingly takes a job for two Saint Bernards, Buffy and Pinky. Mary Anne saves Kristy from the dreaded job of baby-sitting her soon-to-be stepbrother and sister, Andrew and Karen. And Claudia, unfortunately, gets the worst job of all: baby-sitting four rambunctious kids when she had been told it would be only one (mellow) child.<br />Despite the uncertain outcomes of their jobs, everybody in the club considers Kristy's idea a success. They're making plenty of money and doing what they do best: baby-sit.<br />This is a great series for 8 to 12-year-old girls.	2001-11-06

For starters, the new teacher at Bellmont High School (in Brooklyn, New York) pretty much steals her heart on the first day of class. He's brilliant and attractive and shares a lot of the same ideas Brogan has about society and the world. Too bad he's grown more interested in Rosanna Dakis (the beautiful, popular senior in their class) to notice Brogan even exists.<br />At home, it's not much better. Her parents--who she refers to by their first names, Nan and Buster, not \\"Mom\\" and \\"Dad\\"--are on the verge of a divorce. They're constantly fighting; Nan feels stifled and Buster is looking for a mistress, a secret he shamelessly tells his daughter. And, of course, Brogan is caught in the middle, feeling completely helpless and angry.<br />Between home and school, Brogan tries to find some balance in her life. The biggest help of all is from Gracie Pevsner, an older woman she meets while volunteering at the senior citizens center. Gracie inspires Brogan to be proactive and overcome her own ineptness and misery.<br />&quot;Let Me Tell You Everything&quot; is a great book for teenage girls who are struggling with their own identities as feminists.	2001-11-04

I think this last half of the book really put a damper on the whole story. That's mainly why I gave &quot;Biting the Sun&quot; a 3 / 5 score.<br />Perhaps if there were more to her quest than just teenage angst, I would have been won over by &quot;Biting the Sun&quot;. However, I thought the whole plot was pointless and slow, and almost as bad as &quot;Heroine of the World&quot;. The only other sci fi book I've read so far by Tanith Lee is &quot;The Silver Metal Lover&quot;, which is by far a better book than these two combined.

He was attractive, mysterious, and every girl's dream at Jefferson High--especially Tara Braxton's, Julie's friend and beauty queen at the school.<br />Yet Quinn is completely uninterested in Tara. He wants Julie, and nobody will keep him from her either. That becomes perfectly clear at Tara's party when Quinn violently attacks two guys who had been harassing Julie. He claims he was only protecting her, but his jealousy and temper flare out of control time and time again. Soon there's not a minute that goes by that Quinn isn't either questioning Julie's loyalty or threatening any passerby that's male.<br />Then three seemingly unrelated deaths point directly to Quinn as a suspect. The first is the fatal \\"accident\\" of a fellow classmate who knew too much about Quinn's past. The second is a drug-related murder of the two boys at Tara's party.<br />But there's something even worse that haunts Quinn: the death of Alison Barry, the young girl he had killed four years ago--the girl who looks exactly like Julie. Now how far will Quinn go to recapture that same relationship, to keep Julie with him forever?	2001-11-02

She doesn't get very far, however, before she starts feeling guilty about abandoning Bill and Dwayne. Eventually, she returns to their camp with food (they were likely to starve without it) and regains her place as \\"captain\\" of the group.<br />It doesn't take long, though, before Bill starts up again, creating problems between Jeanette and Dwayne, then threatening her without Dwayne's protection (although the \\"boyjock\\" isn't much help when he is around). (Like she didn't see it coming.) But when Bill tries to kill her while they're both hanging off a cliff, Jeanette surprises me by doing what she should have done before: she fights back--and kills Bill Hicks.<br />Moments later Jeanette and Dwayne clear the cliff and stumble across Neil and Samma. Both are alive, but Neil's leg is badly<BR>injured from the flood that separated the group. When they question Bill's absence, Jeanette tries to explain what had happened. Samma, of course, doesn't believe her story at all, but at least Neil does. And that's all that matters to Jeanette. Well, that and trying to get rescued. :)<br />This book is just as exciting as the first, and I highly recommend reading it if you've already read \\"Swept Away\\". There is some semi-graphic violence/hunting (one being a rabbit and the second a bear) that might disgust some readers. The worst, I thought, was the rabbit, basically because I had just gotten a pet rabbit a few days prior to starting this book. Very gross.<br />Despite that--and Jeanette's annoying habit of quoting classic poetry and stories--, there weren't a lot of drawbacks to this book. (...) There's still a lot of witty humor and suspense that makes the story move along pretty fast. Don't miss reading this series if you like Christopher Pike or R. L. Stine.	2001-10-31

Among the group is Geoffrey Chaucer, a famous English poet and an employee of King Richard II. Although Geoffrey isn't a fictitious character, the mystery he sets out to uncover is. It was never proven he was a detective, but his interests in occult practices--such as astrology and Tarot card reading--certainly are relevant, proving to be just as useful as the clues he finds.<br />The mystery begins when a young gypsy woman (Sophia) is found stabbed in the heart while asleep in her bed. The initial suspect is Jack the summoner, who vanishes shortly after Sophia's death. However, there are others who are just as liable to be the killer: Sir Richard de Burgoyne, who strongly discouraged his son Simon from associating with Sophia; the jealous friar Sophia had flirted with; even Geoffrey himself. After all, it was his Tarot card that was found next to Sophia's body.<br />Out of desperation to clear his name, Geoffrey contacts a good friend of his: John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster. With his help--as well as that from a few other pilgrims--,they begin to unravel Sophia's mysterious past and her connection to the Church, discovering an evil brotherhood that will do anything to preserve the sanctity of the Roman Catholic Church.<br />Even though I'm not familiar with the Middle Ages, I thoroughly enjoyed this timeless tale of corrupt clergy and the unconventional methods of profiling Sophia's killer. Not to missed if you like medieval mysteries.	2001-10-29

Books	5	2	2	N	N	Incredible Sequel To The Face on the Milk Carton	&quot;Whatever Happened to Janie?&quot; begins with Jodie Spring (Janie Johnson's biological sister) getting ready for Janie's arrival. At first, I thought the story was going to be told from Jodie's point of view, and I was on the verge of setting this book aside. I didn't think Jodie would be the best choice for a protagonist; I wanted Janie back. But by the second chapter, I realized the book would be alternating between the other characters in the book, not just one. This is definitely a change from &quot;The Face on the Milk Carton&quot; where it was only Janie telling the story, and I think this way is much more effective; now everybody can voice their opinion, even if they don't verbalize it to each other.<br />Once Janie arrives at the Spring's home, she immediately feels homesick. She can't get used to calling the Springs her family, or responding to her birth name: Jennie Spring. Everything they do, how they live, etc.--all of it's alien to her. And she certainly doesn't hold back her feelings, even if it hurts them. It's almost as though Janie wants to hurt them, to make them pay for separating her from her parents.<br />Obviously, there's a lot of resentment between Janie and her two siblings, Stephen and Jodie. From the start, Stephen isn't very accepting, and with his temper, it doesn't look like Janie and he will ever be friends. Jodie, on the other hand, wanted another sister. After all, she was the only girl among three other brothers (Stephen and the twins, Brendan and Brian). But Janie's resistance ruins Jodie's hope of having the perfect relationship with her sister.<br />I don't think one person is left unscarred in this book. If it's not from the transition of a new family member, it's the reopening of old wounds by the FBI who want to find Janie's kidnapper, Hannah Javensen.<br />Despite Janie's harsh decision in the end, I thought it was the right one, although it hurt the Springs tremendously. The whole ordeal was well-written, and if you like true-to-life events, then I highly recommend the Janie series: &quot;The Face on the Milk Carton&quot;, &quot;Whatever Happened to Janie?&quot;, &quot;The Voice on the Radio&quot;, and &quot;What Janie Found&quot;.	2001-10-26

Montgomery	At the beginning of &quot;Emily of New Moon&quot;, Emily Byrd Starr is orphaned when her father dies from a long-drawn-out heart problem that resulted from his wife's death five years ago. Consequently, Emily is sent to live with her mother's family: the Murrays (Aunt Elizabeth, Aunt Laura, and Cousin Jimmy) from Blair Water on New Moon Farm (in Prince Edward Island, Canada). The head of the family, Aunt Elizabeth, remains Emily's biggest obstacle to overcome. She refuses Emily to wear bangs, associate with certain friends, or trespass in Lofty John's orchard. But the worst rule is that Emily is not allowed to read or write fiction, including poetry. Emily, of course, gets away with the other three things (not without consequences, of course), but when Aunt Elizabeth reads her journal, especially the bit about herself, Emily is certain her aunt will send her away for good.<br />Emily's other two relatives are much more agreeable though, particularly Cousin Jimmy who understands her need to create stories. He, too, loves poetry and strongly encourages her to continue writing, which, Emily believes, is her lot in life.<br />In addition, she makes friends with three neighbors (Teddy, Perry, and Ilse), but her friendship with Ilse is the strongest. Despite their hot-and-cold relationship, Emily is fiercely loyal to her best friend. So, when Emily hears a rumor from two of her gossipy aunts about the scandalous disappearance of Ilse's mother, Emily vows to uncover the truth, even while she's deliriously ill with measles.<br />This is a great book for 11+ year-old girls, as are all of L. M. Montgomery's novels. If you liked Emily of New Moon, I highly recommend reading the other two books in the Emily series: &quot;Emily Climbs&quot; and &quot;Emily's Quest&quot;.	2001-10-26

When Corrine died fifteen years earlier (in &quot;If There Be Thorns&quot;), she left the mansion to her oldest son Chris, but only until Bart (her favorite grandson) turned twenty-five; then Foxworth Hall would belong to Bart.<br />So, Cathy and Chris leave their home in California and timidly return to the house that held them prisoner for over three years when they were children. They're met at the door by an old man who claims to be Joel Foxworth, their long-lost uncle. He soon becomes Bart's mentor in the same manner that John Amos was all those years ago, using biblical threats of hell and damnation to manipulate him.<br />Now with seven people living together in Foxworth Hall (Cathy and Chris, Jory and Melodie, Bart, Cindy, and Joel), there is plenty of drama. For starters, Bart plays an evil part in his brother's (Jory) dancing accident that leaves him handicapped for life. Jory's wife and childhood sweetheart (Melodie) turns to Bart for support and, instead, ends up in his bed. She later abandons Jory completely after giving birth to their twin children, because she's too shallow to remain with a crippled husband.<br />Many more rifts are made within the family (alot of them with Joel's help), but one that grows wider is the relationship between Cindy and Bart. If you thought Bart's jealousy in &quot;If There Be Thorns&quot; was bad, wait until you read &quot;Seeds of Yesterday&quot;. Now Cindy has a chance to retaliate against her vicious brother that she didn't have when she was younger.<br />Although this book is an improvement after &quot;If There Be Thorns&quot;, it doesn't have the same spark as the first two Dollanganger books: &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; and &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot;. Cathy and Chris are no more than shadowy figures in the story, easily forgotten in the mess of their children's lives. Even though &quot;Seeds of Yesterday&quot; returns to Cathy's point of view, the book still felt like it belonged to Bart since he was the one creating all the chaos.<br />In short, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book unless you're already into the Dollanganger series or a big V. C. Andrews fan. In my opinion, this is yet another disjointed story trying (and failing) to outshine &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; and &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot;. The series mercifully ends with &quot;Garden of Shadows&quot;.	2001-10-24

They stop in at an odds-and-ends store called World of Stuff where Marshall finds a snow globe for his mother.<br />Later that night, while the two boys are getting ready for bed, Marshall makes an offhand wish for it to snow in Eerie like it does in the snow globe. The next morning, Marshall and Simon awake to a snow storm--and an 80-year-old curse that repeats the same day (December 24, 1917) over and over again. Only Marshall and Simon are aware of the repeated pattern and immediately search out the root of the curse, which originates at a mysterious house that looks exactly like the one in the snow globe.<br />&quot;Have Yourself An Eerie Little Christmas&quot; is the fifth book in the Eerie Indiana series, which is based on the same-named TV show (&quot;Eerie, Indiana&quot;) that aired back in the early 90s. If you liked the show, you'll probably enjoy the books as well. If you've never heard of this series before (book or TV), I'd highly recommend you watch the reruns and read the books, especially if you'd like a junior approach to The X-Files.	2001-10-23

Along the way, they pick up another cyclist: Courtney Thomas, whose father hopes the group's exemplary behavior will rub off on his troubled daughter. (Did he honestly think a month on a bicycle instead of a motorcycle would change her for the better?)<br />As you can tell, Courtney is pretty much the problem child on the trip, wedging enough space between Elizabeth and Todd so she can slither her way into Todd's arms. Jessica is the last to be won over by Courtney's sudden attitude change. Even Jessica's best friend Lila falls for the new girl's sugar-and-spice routine. It seems like anyone the twins are close to, Courtney steals them away.<br />Besides Courtney, there are numerous other problems: Lila discovers Ms. Dalton, her father's new girlfriend, has a secret past, and Lila threatens to expose her unless she does Lila's bidding; Ms. Dalton also struggles with her feelings for her ex, Mr. Collins; Annie and Roger are constantly teased by Bruce, and their relationship unravels because of it; Jessica falls for a guy who barely pays her any attention, which I thought she deserved after the way she treats Barry, the chubby klutz who's in love with her.<br />&quot;Perfect Summer&quot; isn't the best Sweet Valley High book I've read so far, mainly because I couldn't figure out why Jessica and Lila would want to ride a bike for a month and get all sweaty. Also, the whole Courtney fiasco was pretty lame. Why didn't she just run away with her Harley-riding boyfriend instead of obeying her father?<br />This is the first Super Edition in the Sweet Valley High series. &quot;Special Christmas&quot;, &quot;Spring Break&quot;, &quot;Malibu Summer&quot;, &quot;Winter Carnival&quot;, &quot;Spring Fever&quot;, &quot;Falling For Lucas&quot;, and &quot;Jessica Takes Manhattan&quot; follow.	2001-10-22

To fit in, he plans his birthday party with his first best friend, Jeremy Muniz, and invites four other classmates: Brendan, Chris, Steven, and Doug.<br />However, moments before his guests start to arrive, Drak's eccentric aunt and uncle pull up in a hearse with their three obnoxious, spastic children--Vincent, Ella, and Margaret Chompulas.

How will Drak save his friends from being the Chompulas' next meal without ruining his own birthday party?<br />&quot;Drak's Slumber Party&quot; is great for 7 to 10-year-old boys who like vampires but don't necessarily want to read very much (it's only 54 pages with a few illustrations).

Their meeting lasts only a few minutes, but Cassie finds herself unexplainably drawn to him, as though &quot;they were connected by a silver cord&quot;. Once he leaves, Cassie is sure they'll never see each other again. But then news of her sick grandmother drags Cassie and her mother away from their home in Reseda, California, to New Salem, Massachusetts--Adam's hometown.<br />But before Cassie can reunite with him, she meets a dangerous pack of girls (Faye, Deborah, and Suzan) who belong to an exclusive club of about nine other New Salem teenagers. One of the members (Diana) befriends Cassie and gradually tells her about The Club. Although there are a few decent members, Cassie still feels uneasy around them, especially when Kori (a cousin of one of the members) is killed before her initiation into the coven. And now, The Club wants Cassie to take her place. If she joins, will she share the same fate as Kori?<br />&quot;The Initiation&quot; is the first volume in The Secret Circle trilogy, followed by &quot;The Captive&quot; (#2) and &quot;The Power&quot; (#3). Both are worth reading if you liked &quot;The Initiation&quot;.<br />This trilogy is perfect for young adult readers who love suspenseful occult fiction. If you're looking for similar books about witchcraft, I'd recommend the following novels: &quot;Wither&quot; by J. G.

Until now.<br />The story is pretty lively and fast-paced, plus the chapters are short, which is always nice for me since I break after chapters. However, the book is wasted with sex. Not just a little hanky-panky every 25 pages or so, but explicit affairs practically every other chapter (there are 75 chapters; you do the math). It really did the book a disservice, I thought, although some people (mostly men) will probably wholeheartedly disagree. The pursuit of a killer was what propelled me to finish this book, not counting the notches on Kelly's garter belt (if and when she wore one).<br />&quot;Hell's Belle&quot; definitely had potential to be a great suspense novel, even among all the sexually depraved nonsense. However, I'd only recommend this book to readers who love sleaze over police work.	2001-10-18

Ron would be one of the judges at the talent show, and Sheila doesn't want to miss the opportunity to impress him. So, she begins brainstorming for her big night and decides she'll tell jokes since she has a great sense of humor.<br />Talent Night soon approaches, and despite the usual nervousness, Sheila is confident about getting Ron to notice her, if not about winning the talent show. However, one quirky part of the talent show is the gong that's brought on stage. The judges hit the gong if the person on stage has no talent (which I thought was a pretty cruel idea). And, as you might have guessed, Sheila gets &quot;gonged&quot;. If that weren't humiliating enough, guess who was the judge who hit the gong? None other than Ron Lawson.<br />Sheila, of course, is devastated after that night and swears to never set foot back on the stage ever again. She spends weeks feeling sorry for herself, even avoiding her best friend Ellen Berret. ...<br />Sheila Jenkins is an interesting, believable character. Even though I never had the same embarrassing experiences she did, I could still sympathize with her, as will most people who read &quot;What's So Funny About 9th Grade?&quot;<br />Although this book is about kids in the ninth grade, it would probably be more suitable for younger readers in the fifth or sixth grade.

Many students from both schools are less than enthusiastic about this arrangement, particularly Conner McDermott, an El Carro senior. He thinks everything (and everyone) at Sweet Valley is fake and shallow, especially the \\"Barbie twins\\": Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield. Since he has a creative writing class with Elizabeth, Conner sinks his barbs into her the most, and soon the two of them are constant enemies. Yet neither wants to admit their animosity might simply be a mask of their attraction.<br />Jessica, on the other hand, has fewer problems snagging a man: Will Simmons, El Carro's all-star quarterback. Although he's already taken by Melissa Fox (Jess's cheerleading competition), Will continues to see Jessica, but not for long once his girlfriend finds out. Then she's out for blood--Jessica's.<br />&quot;Can't Stay Away&quot; is the first book in yet another Sweet Valley spin-off: SVH: Senior Year. It's also the first book I've read in this new series--and, I must say, I'm impressed. Although I've enjoyed Sweet Valley Twins/High/Kids (after all, I grew up on those books), I think this series will probably surpass Francine Pascal's earlier Sweet Valleys. The writing is an improvement, especially with the interspersed \\"journal entries\\". It definitely makes the story more engaging.<br />For those who are unfamiliar with Sweet Valley and just started Senior Year, I'd strongly recommend reading anything in the Sweet Valley High series. It might help clarify who the leading characters are and their relationships to each other. It's not absolutely necessary, though; some of the back stories are touched on briefly in this book, i.e., Todd and Elizabeth, Ken and Olivia, Lila and her snotty clique.	2001-10-17

From there, three more people are later killed: Lindsey Gannon (a family acquaintance of the Lowells), Sam Jordan (Robin's ex-boyfriend), and Judy Korman (Robin's employee at the Rosewood House).<br />Detective Dex Wilmer leads the investigation of who murdered the above people and wants to kill Robin next. First of all, there's Hollis Caldwell (Robin's fiancee) who has been following Robin, breaking into her work and house (which gets him a restraining order), and has been without alibis on several occasions. Then there's Taylor Noland (Robin's best friend), who has been just as elusive about her whereabouts as Hollis. Taylor also shares another common bond with Hollis (besides having an affair with him): she's in love with Robin--enough to keep her away from Hollis, perhaps forever.<br />The only thing I didn't really like about the book was how everyone seemed to be attracted to each other. For instance, Robin loves Hollis, Taylor loves Robin, Dex loves Robin... You get the idea. Even though a couple of the relationships are relevant to the plot (Robin and Hollis; Taylor and Hollis), some seemed to be thrown in just for spice (Taylor and Robin; Dex and Robin).<br />Also, even though the sex scenes weren't too excessive or graphic (which would have ruined the book, in my opinion), some of them seemed inappropriate, i.e., when Robin and Hollis have sex just after her parents are buried.<br />Overall, I really liked &quot;Cage of Shadows&quot;. It's pretty easy to read, and the ending has a great twist.	2001-10-17

When Jeanette and Neil's long-lost childhood friend (Bill Hicks) calls out of the blue, Jeanette automatically invites him along, despite her sudden uneasiness while talking with him. He just doesn't seem like his old self; he lies about his past and blatantly admits to dissecting the school's mascot. Although Jeanette seems like a level-headed girl, she should have made some excuse to uninvite the weirdo. But I suppose if she had, there wouldn't have been any real suspense later on.<br />So, besides the new addition, their week adventure seems to go as planned--until that night, when they're startled by someone lurking in the bushes outside their campsite. It turns out to be Dwayne Cors, the dumb jock who's in love with Jeanette and considers it his duty to protect her from Neil and Bill.<br />The next day, the group is faced with yet another obstacle; however, this one is much more serious. When they reroute their trip at the last minute, it leads them directly in the path of a flash flood which separates everyone and possibly kills Neil and Samma. (The two are never found.) Jeanette reunites with Bill, although she would rather be on her own. She can't help but suspect her old friend is a sociopath who killed his last girlfriend--and wants her to be the next victim. ...<br />&quot;Swept Away&quot; begins a little slow, but once Jeanette, Bill, Neil, and Samma start their hike around page 50, the book picks up the pace. Jeanette is a great leading character, with Neil as my second favorite. I was a little disappointed when he vanished in the flood, but, hopefully, he'll reappear in &quot;Swept Away: The Mountain&quot; or &quot;Swept Away: The Pit&quot;, the two succeeding books in this series.<br />Two character complaints: Bill is a little too psychotic; it's almost unbelievable. I know he's supposed tobe evil and all, but he switches between madness and coolness too often. Then there's Jeanette, who doesn't react as quickly as I thought she needed to. There were several times when she had the opportunity to flee or attack but did neither.<br />Overall, despite the grim atmosphere, the book is pretty funny, particularly at the beginning. I would recommend &quot;Swept Away&quot; ao anyone who likes Christopher Pike or R. L. Stine books or is a Dafydd ab Hugh fan.	2001-10-15

And, most importantly, who can Lindsay trust?<br />The French art setting is perfect for this book, complete with a budding Paris romance and a few near-death experiences. So, for those who love romantic mysteries, Impressionist art, and Paris, France, I would strongly recommend you find a copy of &quot;Portrait of Victorine&quot; and read it.	2001-10-12

It was assigned in my tenth grade English class, but I doubt I read it, because when the TV movie aired in 1997 (only a couple years after my class), I didn't have a clue what it was about. So, after watching the movie, I decided to &quot;reread&quot; the book.<br />The plot is somewhat the same: a group of high school kids plan to abduct their English teacher as revenge for his unfair treatment of his students. Their plan hits a snag when Mr. Griffin suddenly dies on them before they can release him. Now they face the possibility of murder charges unless they all can cover their tracks and swear to secrecy.<br />While the movie focuses on Susan McConnell as the lead character, the book randomly switches between her and the other four (five in the movie) characters (Mark Kinney, David Ruggles, Betsy Cline, and Jeff Garrett), never really settling on anyone as the &quot;good guy&quot;. The &quot;bad guy&quot; is obvious though--Mark Kinney--, but even he is too psychotic, killing anyone who gets in his way, including David's invalid grandmother. Susan, who I expected to be the practical mind in the group, was just plain weak and annoying. Even David was pretty unredeemable after drugging his own grandmother so he could have a solid alibi.<br />If you hadn't guessed, the only good thing that came out of this book was the movie, which I highly recommend over the book. The idea for &quot;Killing Mr. Griffin&quot; was pretty interesting, especially if you're a high school student with a teacher like Mr. Griffin, but the writing wasn't the best. None of the characters were worth getting to know, plus some of the events were unbelievable, i.e., how Susan and David were recruited--it was too easy to convince them to help.<br />The book isn't very engaging, but if you're a Lois Duncan fan, you might like this one. Otherwise, I'd skip it.	2001-10-10

As a result, she starts sleepwalking again. Her aunt and uncle are concerned about her, worried that her midnight strolls might mean something more, maybe that Jan's a little &quot;unstable&quot;.<br />Although Jan knows she's not crazy, she starts feeling like she is when a series of fires ruin her hometown, and the number one suspect is herself. After all, she had been found sleepwalking outside one burning building and had been seen trespassing at a another burned house. She's also been suffering from memory loss and blackouts. Could all of this mean she's really the one who's been setting fires in her neighborhood? Do the recent arsons have any link to her parent's death--and, if so, did she kill them? Is she capable of killing again?<br />Scared and confused, Jan sets out to find out what's really been happening to her at night and who's responsible for killing her parents if she's not the one who did it.<br />&quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; is a great young adult thriller for girls. Some parts are a little predictable, but it's still pretty exciting.<br />If you like scary stories about sleep disturbances, you might also like &quot;Dream Date&quot; by Sinclair Smith (nightmares).	2001-10-09

She's spent countless hours at the public pool with her two friends, trying to get hunky lifeguard Blaise Paradise to notice her. To her surprise, he does--right after she sneezes on him. Despite that incident, he asks her out to a Fourth of July party. How can she be so lucky? Is he honestly interested in her, or is he just using her?<br />Louise is also debating on whether or not she should skip a grade and go right on to high school next fall. She's smart enough, plus she would be at the same school as Blaise, but she would also be leaving her best friend behind. Could her friendship with Becky survive if Louise decides to enter high school without her?<br />Her summer dilemmas are soon trivialized, though, when her feisty 60-something grandmother (the woman Louise was named after) is brought up from Florida to live out her last days with family. She's dying from lung cancer and probably won't live out the summer. Still she's determined to be around for fall when the leaves begin to change colors. That is her last wish. But will she make it?<br />&quot;Till the Leaves Change&quot; is a touching book for 8 to 12-year-olds about coping with the death of a loved one. It's only 122 pages, so most young readers shouldn't have any trouble finishing this one, especially if you can relate to Louise and her family.	2001-10-09

Heath, however, isn't too pleased with this last aspect of Katie's metamorphosis. He wants her all to himself and will do anything to keep it that way, even if it means killing Katie's new boyfriend.<br />Heath's darker side quickly emerges, as well as his real reason for being so interested in Katie: he wants to steal all of her energy so he can regain some form back in the real world. To do this, Heath controls Katie's mind and body during her sleep, leaving her drained and weak while awake.<br />Despite her condition, Katie refuses to give in. She knows she has to destroy him, but how do you kill something that's not real?<br />&quot;Dream Date&quot; won't turn you into an insomniac like Katie, but you'll still be a little spooked if you're the intended audience: 12+ year-old girls who love creepy teen thrillers.<br />I also recommend &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; by Kate Daniel (sleepwalking).	2001-10-05

The two young boys think they have a pretty normal family: a beautiful, talented mother (Cathy); an equally attractive stepfather (Chris); and a loyal maid (Emma). It all seems too perfect until Jory witnesses a disturbing scene between his mother and &quot;stepfather&quot; in their attic. Afterwards, he realizes his parents have been lying a lot about their pasts--yet he doesn't know the entire truth: that Cathy and Chris are really siblings, not just husband and wife. Jory's questions remain unanswered until the house next door is bought and a woman who dresses in black moves in with her butler.<br />The woman-in-black is Corrine, and she's accompanied by John Amos, her father's faithful, evil butler. Bart is the first to become attached to the odd couple. He receives more attention and love from them, he believes, than from his own family, who no longer consider him the baby when they adopt Cindy, a two-year-old orphan. To make matters worse, John gives Bart Malcolm Foxworth's journal, thus beginning Bart's &quot;change&quot;. Bart takes Malcolm's word as gospel and soon begins mimicking the Grandfather's behavior and thoughts, which really disturbs Cathy and Chris the most.<br />To uncover Bart's strange behavior, the family has to confront Corrine and John, thus reopening old wounds and exposing many family secrets. In the end, Bart becomes warped like the Grandfather, and Corrine and John face the fate they had eluded back at Foxworth Hall in &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot;.<br />This is definitely not one of my favorite V. C. Andrews books. The change in protagonists really threw me, and the way Corrine reappeared in Cathy and Chris's life wasn't very believable. How could Cathy and Chris not know it was their mother living next door to them? I wouldn't recommend reading this book unless you're really into the Dollanganger series or V. C. Andrews books.<br />&quot;If There Be Thorns&quot; is the third book in the Dollanganger series, preceded by &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; and &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; and succeeded by &quot;Seeds of Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Garden of Shadows&quot;.	2001-09-26

She had been an FBI agent five years ago, but that career ended when she had an affair with Special Agent John Quinn, who is now back in her life to help track down a serial killer.<br />The sparks between the two don't rekindle until about halfway into the book, which was a relief and disappointment. It was nice to be able to read a couple hundred pages without the predictable Tami Hoag romance getting in the way. When the inevitable does happen, I kept wondering why--after five years of no contact--would they want to hook up again? They do try to forget about their pasts together, but it's a pretty [poor] attempt.<br />At the beginning of \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", the Cremator (aka Smokey Joe) has just killed his third victim, who might possibly be the daughter of billionaire Peter Bondurant. The only person who saw the killer was Angie DiMarco, a foul-mouthed, homeless teenager, who is the only key witness in the investigation and Kate's new responsibility. To say the least, Kate is reluctant to get involved with a minor, particularly this kid. However, when Angie vanishes from a safe house, Kate fears her young witness may be the Cremator's fourth victim.<br />The beginning of \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" is a little slow and tedious with the introduction of the crime and characters, but by the middle it definitely picks up the pace. The ending, however, is a little disappointing. Or rather, the killer is disappointing--and pathetic. S/he's not what I expected or imagined the Cremator to be like. At least you won't be able to guess who s/he is until close to the end.<br />Overall, \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" is the most exciting book by Tami Hoag I've read so far. (\\"Night Sins\\" is almost a match, but it's not as gruesome as this one. \\"Dark Paradise\\" doesn't even come close in the scare department.) \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" is also pretty humorous. The jokes can be crude (depending on your comfort level), but they're a welcome after some of the serious scenes.<br />Dislikes: Too many characters and details. The result: almost 600 pages, a record for Tami Hoag. Generally, her books average 500 pages.<br />Offensive material: explicit language, sex, incest, murder, self-mutalation... Well, just about everything. If you're easily offended or squeamish, try something else by Tami Hoag, like \\"Dark Paradise\\".<br />For those you enjoyed \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", you should continue with the follow-up novel, \\"Dust to Dust\\".	2001-09-26

Rafi just moved to the school and has already earned the nickname &quot;Cyclops&quot; because of the swollen eye he came to school with one day. From the beginning, Hannah doesn't really like Rafi, basically because most of the other students don't like him--he's too quiet, dyslexic, and always looks like he's been in a fight. Hannah's mother, however, insists he come over for dinner sometime. And after that one night, Hannah learns a lot more about him than she wanted to when he asks her, &quot;Does your father ever lock you in the basement?&quot; and &quot;Have they ever put you in a clothes dryer?&quot;<br />Yet it's not until Hannah overhears her parents discussing Rafi's injuries that she realizes where his bruises and broken bones come from--his stepfather. Then Hannah stops at nothing to prove he's being abused, even sneaking over to his house at night and witnessing it happen.<br />The targetted audience is 8 to 12-year-olds, but everyone can benefit from the moral of the story--protect one another. It's a great story about Hannah's bravery and determination to save Rafi and takes on the very delicate issue of child abuse.<br />Even though this book is set for younger readers, I thought it would have made a much better young adult novel if Hannah and Rafi had been developed more and an extra 100 or so pages added. Otherwise, I thought the story was interesting enough and suitable for everyone.	2001-09-26

He's turned into a coachman one night and given the name Robert so a young scullery maid (Amadea) can attend a prince's ball in style. He was given just that one night as a man, but it was enough to convince him he must remain human.<br />So, after the spell was broken, Robert went in search of the &quot;godmother&quot; to have her change him back. He doesn't find her until a very pivotal scene when Amadea is condemned as a witch for speaking to animals (Robert) and invoking demons (the &quot;godmother&quot;), and she and her husband (the prince) are killed by a mob in public. It's one of my favorite parts of the book and puts an interesting, realistic twist on the traditional Cinderella story.<br />Robert does get transformed back into human form, but he's tormented by his growing hatred for man and seeks revenge for Amadea's death by organizing an army of rats like the Pied Piper.<br />The story has no sex or graphic blood and gore, but I don't consider it a kid's book. I would recommend &quot;The Coachman Rat&quot; to anyone who likes darker fantasy / fairy tale stories with animal characters, particularly rats. It's very entertaining and will make you think afterwards. The ending is also appropriate considering the rat's stigma during the Middle Ages.	2001-09-26

He got the name &quot;Bunnicula&quot; because he's obviously a bunny and they found him at a Dracula movie. Everybody loves him except Chester the cat, whose jealousy grows to suspicion when he notices the cute little baby rabbit has fangs instead of normal incisors.<br />Harold the dog doesn't believe his friend's theory about Bunnicula being a vampire bunny. However, when Chester claims to have seen Bunnicula sneaking out of the kitchen late one night and then a drained white tomato is found in the kitchen the following morning, Harold can't help but believe Chester is right.<br />Following the incident, several more white vegetables are found, and because the Monroes don't suspect their newest pet is responsible for sucking the life out of their food, Chester takes it on himself to rid the house of Bunnicula. He tries several times by decorating the house with garlic and driving a &quot;steak&quot; through the sleeping bunny's heart, but in the end, the Monroes think Chester is just jealous of the new bunny. Consequently, he's sent to a cat psychiatrist to resolve his sibling rivalry, leaving the mystery of Bunnicula open and unanswered.<br />&quot;Bunnicula&quot; is a great book for kids 8 - 12, especially for those who love cats, dogs, or rabbits. If you liked this book, I would also recommend the other books involving Harold, Chester, and Bunnicula: The Celery Stalks at Midnight, Howliday Inn, Return to Howliday Inn, Nighty-Nightmare, Bunnicula Escapes! and Bunnicula Strikes Again!<br />For fans of animal-oriented children's books, try &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; by E.

It's about a twelve-year-old girl named Bryn Cameron who moves from Circleville, Ohio, to Kenmore, Ontario, Canada, with her father. Bryn's mother has died recently and her father and her are coming to live with her mother's sister (Aunt Pearl) and her aunt's fourteen-year-old mentally handicapped daughter (Winnie) on their farm.<br />Bryn's new family takes some getting used to. She soon learns how nonexistent her mother's relationship had been with her sister: Aunt Pearl didn't know Julia (Bryn's mother) had died, or that Julia had a daughter. Even though her aunt welcomes them in to her home, she doesn't show a lot of interest in them at first and has some difficulty in showing affection. But Bryn knows Aunt Pearl isn't a cold woman; she's witnessed how compassionate her aunt can be when she's around Winnie.<br />Making friends in the small town soon becomes another obstacle, especially with her cousin tagging along (who some have nicknamed &quot;Snake Girl&quot; because of her slanted eyes). Despite their rudeness and jokes, Bryn still hangs out with the local kids (Cecil, Rita, Ed, Rachel, Virginia), and even saves one of them from drowning in the Castor River.<br />By the end of the book, Bryn is able to cope better with her mother's death, Rita (the bully), and her aunt and cousin. However, her father still seems to be a little distant. The only chance she has of understanding his loss of his wife is by reading the letters he still writes to Julia.<br />&quot;The Falcon's Wing&quot; is one of my favorite young adult books. The main characters are believable and I could sympathize with Bryn. The reading level is for ages 9 - 13, but I would recommend this book to anyone interested. Another book I would recommend is &quot;The Summer of the Swans&quot; by Betsy Byars (mentally handicapped family member).	2001-09-26

I bought  it because of the attractive, moody front cover, plus the synopsis on the back didn't sound too bad. Basically, it said Marilee Jennings, an ex-court reporter, left California for New Eden, Montana, to visit her friend (Lucy MacAdam) and remained to uncover the truth of her friend's death. But you wouldn't have guessed that was the plot after reading the book. However, before I start criticizing, let me introduce the main characters.<br />Marilee is the protagonist in &quot;Dark Paradise&quot;; J. D. Rafferty is the rugged cowboy who had shared the late Lucy MacAdam's bed before jumping to Marilee's. It's a common formula Tami Hoag uses in her books: outwardly strong leading lady falls for tough, macho guy. Although I'm not much into romance novels, I'm sure a lot of Hoag's fans enjoy her books for this common thread.<br />Then there's J. D.'s brother Will who's constantly having problems with monogamy, which compels his wife to associate with the Hollywood crowd that has invaded Montana. Among this group is Evan Bryce, a well-to-do man who's interested in Lucy's land and has one unusual relationship with his female cousin (who I kept expecting to be a man because of the repeated references to her manly looks). There are several other nonexistent characters--such as J. D.'s crazy uncle who is a suspect in Lucy's death--, but most of them are easily forgotten and insignificant in the end.<br />&quot;Dark Paradise&quot; is more of a romance book than a mystery. It's almost pointless to try and guess the killer because there's hardly any real suspense. Also, Lucy barely seems important to the story since she's rarely brought up. Several times I forgot why Marilee was remaining in Montana (besides J. D., of course). However, it is well-written and pretty entertaining.<br />Only attempt this book if you like Tami Hoag's romantic suspense and verbosity (500+ pages). If you're looking for a good scare, you might try her other mystery books (Night Sins, Ashes to Ashes).	2001-09-26

After all, the review on the front cover said it was \\"The Most Terrifying Novel of Sensuous Evil Since Anne Rice's Interview With the Vampire\\". (I hadn't finished Interview yet, but I figured if they could compare the two books, it must be worth reading.) Unfortunately, this is one of the worst vampire books I've ever read.<br />It begins in 1955 with a prostitute being murdered by Charles Austra, brother to Stephen Austra. Both are vampires, but neither is very much alike. While Charles enjoys the darker, seedier aspects of life, Stephen is an artist and all-around good guy. He's also in love with his handicapped neighbor, Helen Wells. Her uncle, Dick, is the police officer investigating Charles's murders, and because the two brothers look so much alike, Dick thinks Stephen is the killer.<br />The book was confusing at times, but that may have been my own fault. I was already losing interest a few chapters into it. Even though it's not long (approximately 372 pages), it seemed to drag on forever.<br />I would only recommend this book to die-hard vampire fans who will read anything with blood and fangs in it. Otherwise, don't waste your time. Try Anne Rice's Interview With the Vampire instead.<br />If you've already read this book and enjoyed it, you might like the other two books in the trilogy: Blood Alone and Blood Rites.	2001-09-26

In fact, when she defeats their hair-cutting ambush in the girls' bathroom, Danielle, Brooke, and Tiffany are certain Helga's luck is otherworldly. &quot;She's a ghost,&quot; Danielle states. &quot;The ghost of Charity Chase.&quot;<br />With this discovery, the three girls decide there's no other choice but to get rid of &quot;Charity&quot; once and for all. However, it's not easy for them since they've begun to age rapidly, a curse they believe &quot;Charity&quot; has bestowed on them as revenge.<br />&quot;A Fate Totally Worse Than Death&quot; is a fun and witty book to read, and the ending will probably surprise you. (At least I was surprised.) I would recommend this book to anyone who likes parodies or just wants to kill a few hours with a good teen horror book.<br />The book was supposed to be made into a movie last year, but from what I heard, it's not going to happen. So, it might still be done, but I wouldn't hold my breath.	2001-09-26

They were Rebecca Cole, Sarah Hutchins, and Elizabeth Wither (the leader of the coven and the creator of the Windale Curse).<br />Now, in October of 1999, three different women will become the victims of that curse: Abby MacNeil, a sad 8-year-old girl who discovers the witches' grave sites while playing in the woods; Karen Glazer, a pregnant 38-year-old professor at Danfield College who fears her unborn child is not entirely human; and Wendy Ward, the young college student who unknowingly beckons the attention of Wither and her two companions while performing a magical ceremony.<br />As Halloween draws closer, on the 300-year-old anniversary of the Windale Witches' hanging, Wither, Rebecca, and Sarah prey upon the tiny town after their 100-year slumber. (They awake every 100 years in October to feast and terrorize the people of Windale.) Ultimately, the three witches plan to overtake Abby, Karen, and Wendy as hosts, to perpetuate another 300 years of horror in new bodies.<br />&quot;Wither&quot; is a really good horror novel and doesn't rely on extreme gore to excite the reader. Although it is pretty long (438 pages), the book moves along rather quickly once you begin reading it. However, the ending is a little disappointing and rushed. Also, the book wasn't very clear about what kind of monsters the witches had become. A nice touch to the book, though, is the realistic portrayal of witchcraft (Wicca). So, for those who are practicing witches and enjoy horror novels, you'll probably really like this one.<br />&quot;Wither&quot; was supposed to be made into a movie, but I haven't heard anything about it yet.<br />If you enjoy suspensful witch lore, you might like some of the following books: &quot;Cat Magic&quot; by Whitley Strieber; &quot;The Witching Hour&quot;, &quot;Lasher&quot;, and &quot;Taltos&quot;--all by Anne Rice; The Secret Circle trilogy by L.

Sharon McKay has been accused of killing her best friend, Ann Rice, but Sharon knows she's innocent. Ann had apparently died from a fall from a cliff, but there's no real proof of this because her body was never found. So, it's up to Sharon's attorney, Johnny Richmond, to prove that she didn't push Ann off the cliff, rather Ann jumped to her death.<br />The book switches between the present (the trial) and the past (just before, and up to, Ann's death). The reader soon learns Ann harbored a strong hatred for her best friend Sharon. She blamed Sharon for breaking her brother's (Jerry Rice) heart, which ultimately lead to his suicide one year ago. However, nobody knows about Ann's pent-up anger--least of all Sharon--, except for Ann's boyfriend, Paul Lear. He's the only one Ann confides in about her need for revenge.<br />The plan is simple: invite a group of unsuspecting friends on a camping trip as witnesses, get Sharon alone with Ann, then when the opportunity is right, fake her own death by dropping over the side of the cliff with a safety harness on. (All the equipment had been strategically placed beforehand.) She would then maneuver down the side of the rock and run away to safety. Sharon would obviously be the number one suspect since she was the last person with Ann, and, more than likely, Sharon would be found guilty and put behind bars. It seemed perfect enough--until Ann discovered the real cause of her brother's death. But by then it's too late.<br />&quot;Fall into Darkness&quot; has a great twist in the end. This is one of Christopher Pike's better books. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes teen suspense and/or Christopher Pike books.<br />&quot;Fall into Darkness&quot; was later made into a TV movie in 1996, starring Tatyana Ali, Jonathan Brandis, Charlotte Ross, and Paul Scherrer. Christopher Pike was one the producers of the film. .... Unfortunately, I never saw it, but I'm hoping it was as good as the book.	2001-09-26

Nobody is sure what happened to him, but everyone expects the worst because it's not typical for Charlie to have run off alone.<br />Sara feels responsible for losing her brother since she's the closest to him. Aunt Willie also blames herself because she had promised Sara and Charlie's dead mother she would protect him--and now he's gone.<br />Soon a search party gathers and everyone begins to look for the missing ten-year-old.<br />Even though &quot;The Summer of the Swans&quot; is primarily about the search for Charlie, Sara's family life begins to open up and we discover the different relationships she has with her simple younger brother Charlie, her overbearing aunt Willie, her older sister Wanda, and her remote father.<br />The recommended age group for this book is 8 - 12, but I would recommend it to anyone who has a mentally handicapped family member or can somehow relate with the story. It's easy reading and moves along rather quickly--the chapters are short and there are a few illustrations by Ted CoConis.<br />&quot;The Summer of the Swans&quot; won the Newbery Award in 1971. The book was later made into a TV movie in 1974 (aka &quot;Sara's Summer of the Swans&quot;), which I never saw because it was made before I was born.<br />I also recommend reading &quot;The Falcon's Wing&quot; by Dawna Lisa Buchanan (mentally handicapped family member).	2001-09-26
1828002:US	50720905	R17W8X5FJYHJH8	0345370597	441585150	Nightwing	Books	3	13	21	N	N	Where Were The Bats?	&quot;Nightwing&quot; didn't particularly spark my interest when I picked it up a few months ago at a book sale. But after reading &quot;Vespers&quot; by Jeff Rovin, I wanted to continue reading anything scary about bats. Finally, I decided to give it a try after seeing Stephen King's review on the front cover: &quot;I consider it to be one of the best horror novels in the last twenty years.&quot;<br />From the beginning, &quot;Nightwing&quot; doesn't appear like a horror book. We meet Youngman Duran, a Tewa Pueblo deputy, conversing with an old Hopi priest, his uncle, who predicts death and a new beginning for the Hopi people. Youngman doesn't pay much attention to the datura-addicted elder; he finds his prophecies almost comical.<br />Next Youngman is called to a ranch where three horses have been skinned and left to suffer and die. Nobody knows how it happened. Then the same thing later happens to Youngman's Hopi uncle previously mentioned, Abner Tasupi.<br />While Youngman is preparing the old man's body for burial, a stranger (Hayden Paine) intrudes and attempts to perform an autopsy on Abner. Paine is a bat specialist and has come up from Mexico to conduct a medical survey. Although Paine and Youngman don't get along at first, they later team up with Youngman's lover, Anne Dillon, to destroy the disease-spreading vampire bats.<br />The bats, however, play a very small part in this book. I wouldn't even consider it a horror book since the rough Southwest Indian lifestyle overshadows the bats. Furthermore, I'm not sure why the synopsis on the back cover focuses on a deadly mass of bloodthirsty bats when they only dominate a few scenes. I suppose it was the only way to lure anyone into reading this book.<br />There are some gruesome parts in Nightwing, but the worst ones I can remember are done by humans to animals. For example, a dog is suffocated in a bag instead of quarantined for the plague; a rabbit is slowly drained of blood for a sacrifice. The bat attacksdidn't bother me (I expected them), but I was disgusted by the gratuitous animal torture.<br />The only reason why I gave this book three stars instead of two or one (which it deserved) is because it was written pretty well and there were a few times when it got exciting. Still, it was a waste of my time and I wouldn't recommend this book. It seemed pretty long too for a 210-paged book. That was probably because the chapters were on average 20 pages and paragraphs could run up to a page or more in length.<br />However, someone must have loved &quot;Nightwing&quot; because it was made into a movie in 1979. I never saw it and I doubt I will.<br />I do regret reading this book for the sake of bat horror. If you're looking for a good scare, read &quot;Vespers&quot; by Jeff Rovin, which is by far a better horror book than &quot;Nightwing&quot;.	2001-09-26
1828058:US	50720905	RXX042K6WHMSQ	0671729411	173166968	Flowers in the Attic (Dollanganger)	Books	5	47	64	N	N	Incredible Debut; One of a Kind	Flowers in the Attic is about four children (Chris, Cathy, Cory, Carrie) who are locked away in their grandparent's northern room and attic to secure their mother's (Corrine) chance at inheriting her dying father's fortune. You see, her father's will states Corrine must not have had any children from her first marriage (which recently ended when Corrine's husband died in a car accident, leaving them penniless and heartbroken), or she would be disinherited. The reason for the grandfather's disdain of Corrine's marriage: Corrine had eloped with her half-uncle (who is actually not her half-uncle; read Garden of Shadows and you'll find out who he really is). Now, the grandparents are highly religious people and they believe any children that would result from that marriage would surely be deformed and evil. Therefore, Corrine creates a plan to hide her children &quot;safely&quot; away in her parent's enormous mansion (Foxworth Hall)--with the help of the grandmother--and sets out to win back her father's love and acceptance and, in short, his money.<br />The book is told from the point of view of Cathy Dollanganger, who is probably one of my favorite heroines in all of V. C. Andrews' books. She is a strong, smart 12-year-old whose main focus is to become a world-famous ballerina. Her older brother Chris is more intellectual and eventually wants to become a doctor. They are tolerant, at first, of being kept in a room with no sun or friends, but the days soon begin to drag on and still no word of their grandfather's death. Yet they hold on for their mother and try to rationalize their sacrifice of freedom for those millions of dollars.<br />Before long, the abuse starts: the grandmother's cruel punishments begin with whippings and escalates to starvation. The children have nobody to turn to since they've been alienated from the world and even their mother has grown more absent from their lives, too busy traveling all over Europe and flirting with a man who will eventuallybecome her second husband. So, they turn to each other instead for solace, which soon becomes complicated when Chris and Cathy hit puberty and start experiencing unsettling yearnings for each other. This attraction is obvious to the grandmother and gives her more reason to punish the grandchildren she believes are the spawn of Satan.<br />By the end of the book, one of the Dollanganger children dies from food poisoning and the remaining three promise to somehow escape Foxworth Hall. Also, the mystery of who poisoned the children's food is discovered--and it's not who you would immediately assume.<br />Flowers in the Attic is V. C. Andrews' first and most popular book. It's also the first in the Dollanganger series; Petals on the Wind, If There Be Thorns, Seeds of Yesterday, and Garden of Shadows follow.<br />The book was later made into a movie in 1987 and starred Kristy Swanson, Louise Fletcher, Victoria Tennant, and Jeb Stuart Adams. V. C. Andrews even had a small cameo as the window washer/maid. The movie isn't exactly like the book (which is true for most movie adaptations), but it's still one of my favorite movies. I strongly recommend anyone who read the book to see the movie, if not to at least say you have seen and read both. If you saw the movie without reading Flowers in the Attic, you'll probably like the book much better. There are more things that are revealed in the book that were excluded from the movie, like several intimate moments between Cathy and Chris, which weren't included for obvious reasons. Plus, the ending of the movie is very different from the book. It would have been nice if it had ended appropriately so a possible sequel could have been made.<br />In short, I loved Flowers in the Attic and I would recommend it to anyone who can read. There are certain topics, such as incest and child abuse, which might be offensive to more sensitive readers, but for those that it doesn't offend: definitely find a copy of this book and read it.	2001-09-26

She's going to meet her two friends (Mandy Bart and Michele Kala) in Maui, who have already started their vacation a couple days earlier.<br />Jean is expecting to have a great time there, but she doesn't even leave the airplane before her vacation is changed for the worse. The young man (Mike Clyde) sitting next to her suddenly has a seizure and dies. Although she only got to know him briefly, Jean is very affected by his death.<br />She tries to forget about the incident once she arrives on the island. Her two friends try to help by introducing her to two scuba diving instructors, Johnny and Dave. The five of them make plans to go scuba diving, which is a great distraction for Jean. She's quick to pick up on the sport, and it becomes a necessary skill for her throughout the book. She also falls for Johnny, even though she had promised Mandy she wouldn't interfere since Mandy had set her eyes on him first.<br />Even though she is able to suppress the horror on the plane for awhile, Jean begins having nightmares, and one in particular remains predominant. She's swimming in the ocean with Mike. He leads her to a cave, exactly like the one he had described to her on the plane, and shows her a human skull with a bullet hole in it. Jean knows Mike is trying to tell her something, but she doesn't know what.<br />Then, on another scuba diving trip with her friends, Jean insists they swim out to a vacant cove. For reasons unknown, she's drawn to this spot. It becomes even more eerie when Jean finds a cave and skull just like the one Mike had shown her in her dream.<br />This supernatural mystery links two separate deaths: the death of Mike and a fellow scuba diver of Dave and Johnny's, Ringo. At first, neither seem related at all. After all, Mike had died on the plane and Dave and Johnny's friend had died a year ago. However, Jean reveals that Mike had, in fact, died a month ago--notdays ago--at the exact spot where she found the cave and skull. His ghost is what keeps hanging around, haunting her dreams and almost driving her crazy. But it's the only way for him to show her the clues that will uncover and solve his death, as well as Ringo's.<br />I had a hard time getting into this book. Mike's death at the beginning seemed pointless, and I wasn't really sure how the book was going to develop. Then, halfway through it, the book began to pick up the pace and I was able to put the pieces of the plot together. I wasn't too surprised, though, when I found out who the bad guy was. In fact, you'll probably be able to guess him/her close to the end; it's really obvious.<br />The book as a whole wasn't too terribly bad, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this one. Unless you love Christopher Pike books, I'd take the advice of the title and dig a bottomless pit and toss this one in.	2001-09-26

She's being sent away to her Aunt Madelyn's in Palm Beach so her parents can save their dwindling marriage. Andrea isn't too thrilled about the arrangement, to say the least, but she's cooperative. She doesn't like her aunt very much, who reminds her of \\"the wicked queen in Disney's Snow White\\" with her designer clothes, black hair, and thin frame. Her aunt is also a maniac about collecting valuable art, and one in particular: a Peruvian artifact which belongs to a close friend of hers, Judge Justin Arlington-Hughes.<br />Not long after Andrea arrives in Palm Beach, she's brought to an island in the Little Bahama Banks with her aunt to see this artifact. Andrea is upset because she knows the gem belongs to the Peruvian government, not smuggled overseas and sold to the highest bidder. However, nobody wants to listen to a self-righteous 17-year-old, and she's quickly snubbed by her aunt and the other three artifact-enthusiasts on the trip.<br />At the island, everyone gets the chance to see the incredible jewel in an after-dinner exhibition by candlelight. However, within seconds, the show turns fatal when the judge is electrocuted while plugging in a worn lamp that appears to have been tampered with. And to top everything off, the jewel is missing. Yet they have no way of contacting authorities because there is no phone or way off the island. So, they are trapped together with a killer and thief until the return boat arrives to save them. But that's several days away, and in the meantime, another guest is killed.<br />Because nobody suspects Andrea, she's able to explore the island on her own and try to find an escape. What she finds, though, is a stranger (Pete Michaels) wandering the island. His boat was damaged, so he decided to anchor it in a nearby cove and look for help ashore. Although she is wary of him, Pete's her only hope of escaping the island. But can she trust him?<br />As a mystery, I would have given this book three stars. There weren't a lot of scares for me, but at least I didn't figure out the culprit until the end. So, even though I wouldn't say it's the best mystery I've ever read, it's certainly a good young adult book, and anyone who likes mysteries, islands, and young female sleuths will probably like it.	2001-09-26

I certainly didn't when I bought &quot;Sins of a Shaker Summer&quot; at a book sale several months ago. I was just looking for a new mystery to read, and I really didn't pay too much attention to the description on the back cover. It was on sale; what more can I say? :)<br />For those who don't know, a Shaker is a member of a sect, like the Quakers, that began in the 1700s. The name \\"Shaker\\" referred to their spirit-inspired trembling, which you'll witness in the book. Today, their communities are almost nonexistent, but some Shaker villages have been restored for public view, particularly in the Northeast.<br />&quot;Sins of a Shaker Summer&quot; takes place in North Homage, Kentucky, during the 1930s when the Believer population was still existing. Sister Rose Callahan is the eldress of the village and the leading sleuth in this series. She's helped by a young friend of hers, Gennie Malone, who had once been part of the community but now lives \\"out in the world\\".<br />The mystery begins when two young girls are found ill after they ingested several poisonous plants on accident. Rose immediately suspects the four new Believers who have transferred from another Shaker village in New York. All of them have some knowledge of herbal medicine, but one individual remains a strong suspect: Patience McCormick. However, when Rose finds Patience dead with a wound to the back of her head, she realizes she was mistaken and that the killer will do anything to keep his/her secrets hidden.<br />&quot;Sins of a Shaker Summer&quot; is a charming historical mystery. There's nothing offensive in this book, so it's appropriate for all ages. If you've already read this third installment in the Sister Rose Callahan series, I would encourage you to read the other four books: Death of a Winter Shaker (#1), A Deadly Shaker Spring (#2), A Simple Shaker Murder (#4), and Killing Gifts (#5).<br />It's not necessary to know anything about Shakers before you approach this book. Their lifestyle is gradually explained throughout the book without it reading like a history textbook. Although the lifestyle didn't appeal to me, some readers will probably love their simple way of life.<br />While I was reading &quot;Sins of a Shaker Summer&quot;, I kept thinking about the movie Witness starring Harrison Ford. It's the only film I'm aware of that involves another similar group: the Amish. I would recommend this movie if you like the Shaker / Amish theme, but only if you don't mind the extra sex and violence, which &quot;Sins of a Shaker Summer&quot; has none of.	2001-09-26

She's a dreamer, but mostly she's a procrastinator, always putting off her duties until later.<br />One day she gets lost in the woods and finds a unicorn with his horn stuck in a tree branch. Morgan, the unicorn, asks if she'll help him break free. The princess, however, would rather go play than help Morgan this minute. But she promises to return later.<br />Once she grows bored of playing, the princess returns and cuts the branch away for Morgan. Together they roam the meadow, Morgan having since forgiven the princess for her belated rescue. However, the princess doesn't watch her step while they are playing and falls into a pond. From the safety of a lily pad, she calls for Morgan to help her. Morgan replies he will--eventually.<br />The princess realizes her mistake earlier and heartfully apologizes to Morgan. Convinced, Morgan rescues the princess from the pond. And ever since, they've been best friends.<br />I would recommend this book to young children, but I'm sure most adults will enjoy it just as much. Robin James is the talented illustrator of &quot;Morgan and Me&quot; and many other Stephen Cosgrove books. I highly recommend you read all of Cosgrove's books if you liked this one.	2001-09-26

Three years ago, her mother and stepfather died in a car accident, and now, after spending some time at a private school, she's come to live with her aunt and uncle. Her real father was a world traveler who's been missing for thirteen years, but still remains her biggest inspiration.<br />One day, Betsy is invited to sit-in on a meeting of the school's drama club, Spotlighters. Before she knows it, she's involved in the upcoming play \\"The Madwoman of Chaillot\\" and two other plays later that year. Her decision to join the club mainly had to do with Nick Gretschkin, the attractive senior who's also in Spotlighters. Unfortunately, he's already involved with another fellow drama member (Stackie Delahay), but that's not going to stop Betsy from trying.<br />During the remaining year of high school, Betsy is overwhelmed with her feelings of \\"being distressed with Harry, happy with Jan, angry with Stackie, annoyed by Pierrot\\" --(all fellow actors)-- \\"inspired by Bar\\" --(her drama teacher)-- \\"communicating with Aunt Val and Uncle Win, and baffled, frustrated, agonizingly in love with, and worried about Nick.\\"<br />Since being bitten by the acting bug, Betsy has made plans, like her friends, to pursue acting after high school. Even though she's lucky and is accepted at London Academy of Dramatic Art, most of her friends are rejected and left completely clueless about their futures in theater. To further the upset, one of Betsy's friends has been diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease and expects a long battle with the radiation treatment.<br />\\"Break a Leg, Betsy Maybe!\\" is a pretty good book about a young woman who is troubled by her double-identity (no, not a split personality). Part of her remains as Betsy Maybe, a nervous, insecure girl who breaks out in hives when anxious, but part of her wants to be Cythera Wilkersen, her alter ego. Cythera was the name her missing father gave her, so Betsy has a certain attachment to it. \\"Cythera\\" is everything she's not but wants to be: an adventurer like her father, beautiful, strong, confident. Yet, Betsy realizes she can't compete with the unrealistic expectation and, instead, learns to grow comfortable with herself.<br />There are a few more complaints I do have about this book though. One, Betsy seemed too self-assured around Nick for someone who breaks out in hives sporadically. And Nick didn't seem too interested in her anyway, or, at least, I never picked up on a \\"vibe\\" between them. Two, Betsy rarely speaks about her dead mother and stepfather. I began to wonder if she was even affected by their death. She seemed more impacted by her father's disappearance and living up to his christening than being orphaned. Perhaps the author didn't want to be too depressing, but I thought a few reminiscent scenes of her mother and stepfather would have been appropriate. Otherwise, why even mention Betsy being orphaned?<br />Still, I would recommend this book to anyone 12 and up who enjoys school plays and drama clubs. For younger readers, you might like \\"What's So Funny About 9th Grade?\\" by Catherine Clark, since it's also about school plays.	2001-09-26

For as long as she can remember, Audrina has always lived in the shadow of her dead older sister, also named Audrina. In fact, Audrina was named after her sister so she might gain her \\"gifts\\". The pressure is so intense on the seven-year-old that she feels like she'll never be able to be as perfect as the First Audrina.<br />Because Audrina is expected to be like her sister, she has no real memories of her own. Her sense of time is also out of whack; days, even weeks, can go by and she doesn't remember what's happened. She's also kept from school and from having any friends because her parents insist she's too fragile.<br />The mystery of her older sister's death is also a nagging reminder of what happens to girls who disobey the rules and visit the woods anyway. (The First Audrina had been raped and killed there.) Nevertheless, Audrina decides to go one day, and she meets a boy her age named Arden Lowe who will eventually become her husband and her key to her own past.<br />&quot;My Sweet Audrina&quot; is the only V. C. Andrews book that doesn't belong to a series and is quite successful on its own. I would have given it five stars, but the ending was much too disappointing. How could Audrina demean herself by staying with Arden after what he'd been involved in? (I can't elaborate without giving away the plot.)<br />Besides that, this is one of V. C. Andrews' best books, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes psychological suspense or is already a V. C. Andrews fan.	2001-09-26

The Furry Eyefulls are obsessed with watching beautiful things in their forest, so much that they can't sleep and soon grow extremely grouchy and short-tempered with each other. Kartusch helps them relax by telling them to close their eyes and listen to the beautiful sounds in the forest. Soon enough, the Furry Eyefulls begin to nod off and mercifully fall asleep.<br />The moral of the story:<br />&quot;You may see all that is around you but you may feel nothing at all.<BR>So try and close your eyes so tight and listen to the night time fall.&quot;<br />&quot;Kartusch&quot; is a great children's book and beautifully illustrated by Robin James.

However, their travels are cut short because of Carrie's poor health. They are assisted by a mute woman (Henrietta Beech) who takes them to her boss, Dr. Paul Sheffield, their soon-to-be guardian.<br />The three children have a new chance at a &quot;normal&quot; childhood. They attend school, and Cathy and Chris even begin pursuing their personal goals: Cathy joins a ballet school; Chris later enters medical school.<br />At her ballet practices, Cathy meets Julian Marquet, the son of her instructor. He is attracted to Cathy and pursues her until she agrees to marry him. All the while, Cathy is torn between these three men: her older brother Chris who never abandoned his love for her since they left Foxworth Hall; her much older guardian Paul who becomes her first lover; and Julian, her abusive new husband, who she married out of desperation rather than love. One of them fathers her first son Jory.<br />Carrie, on the other hand, doesn't have as much success as her older siblings. She's constantly teased by her classmates because of her short size and large head, which makes her become more withdrawn and miserable. Then one last encounter with her mother leaves Carrie on the brink of suicide.<br />Throughout the book, Cathy strikes out at Corrine, trying to ruin her mother's life any way she can. At the height of her revenge, Cathy steals her mother's husband away from her, becomes pregnant by him with her second son (Bart Jr), and publicly announces her imprisonment in Foxworth Hall.<br />&quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; is the second book in the Dollanganger series, preceded by &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; and followed by &quot;If There Be Thorns&quot;, &quot;Seeds of Yesterday&quot;, and &quot;Garden of Shadows&quot;.<br />This was the first V. C. Andrews book I ever read and is still my favorite. If no other Dollanganger books had followed this one, I would have been satisfied with the series. As far as I'm concerned, &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; and &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; are the only two books worth reading in the Dollanganger series. Although the other three all have their significance to the Foxworth-Dollanganger storyline, I was only interested in the lives of Cathy, Chris, and Carrie; no other characters captured my interest very much. <br />Also, for being a sequel, &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; is very successful and true. The effects of their imprisonment in the attic are life-long scars: Carrie's dwarfism; Chris's desire for Cathy; Cathy's bitterness. If you've read &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;, &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; is a must-read. It's the aftermath of the children's stay in the attic and how they choose to forget or remember what happened.	2001-09-26

So, when the two boys and their father return home with a young deer one day, she puts the Magic Finger on the entire family. The Magic Finger is like the evil eye, except the results from her spell are much more amusing.<br />The curse doesn't occur immediately. The Greggs still have enough  time to go out again that day and shoot some ducks. After their hunt, they go home with their twenty birds--sixteen are dead, but four continue to follow them home in the air. Although the Greggs try to shoot these four pests, they can never manage to hit them.<br />When the family is getting ready for bed that night, something outrageous begins to happen--they're turning into birds. Furthermore, the four ducks who had followed them home have grown as large as humans with arms instead of wings. In the sudden turn of events, the Greggs lose their house to the wild ducks and must survive on their own by building a nest for shelter, searching for edible food, and avoiding predators--especially ones with guns.<br />The Magic Finger is a wonderful book for 8 to 12-years-old and is short enough (approximately 64 pages with plenty of illustrations) to keep anyone's attention. I really liked the moral of the story, probably since I am a vegan and against hunting. The book isn't preachy, but there's certainly something to learn when the roles of human and animal are reversed.	2001-09-26

The Kith and Kin are fascinated by the stone, but neither the Kith or Kin want to share it with the other. They fight and squabble over possession of it. All the while, Trafalgar True witnesses their fighting and grows sad because of it.<br />Then Trafalgar True realizes what he must do: he must return the Sunstone to the sun. So, he begins his rise into the sky when the Kith and Kin find their Sunstone gone. At first they accuse the other of stealing it, but one of them notices Trafalgar flying in  the sky with the stone in his grasp. Obviously, they know no one could fly to the sun and survive, so they gather in a circle and call for Trafalgar to return. As soon as he does, the Kith and Kin decide it was pointless to fight over the Sunstone; instead, they would share it.<br />The moral:<br />&quot;So, when it comes to sharing<BR>With Kith and Kin or you,<BR>Remember what you're sharing<BR>Is the love of Trafalgar True.&quot;<br />Both adults and children will love this book.

After all, this is where she's grown up with her best friend Denise Prendes. But Angela's father wants more for her. He knows his daughter is a bright student and wants to succeed at college, but she certainly won't get the help she needs at her current high school. So he arranges for an interview for her at Mt. Pleasant School, a rich New Hampshire private school that offers scholarships to underprivileged teens like Angela.<br />Angela, at first, refuses to attend a high school with snobs. She wants to remain with her friends in New York, not trying to pretend she belongs where she doesn't. But she eventually realizes this is her only chance to get a better education and do something more meaningful with her life than what lay ahead for her in New York City.<br />Once she arrives at Mt. Pleasant School, Angela remains distant from the other students, feeling like a complete outcast when she compares their lifestyle to hers. Her stay at the school doesn't appear promising at first, especially when she fights with her roommate (Gabriella Fuentes Cameron) on her first day. However, the two girls later patch up their differences and become good friends.<br />Angela's outlook further improves when she meets Andy Bean, a local gas attendant who works a few blocks away from her new school. She meets him while stopping by to fuel up Gabriella's Porsche, which he believes is hers. Angela makes no attempt to say otherwise, a mistake that will later ruin their relationship based on Andy's superficial interest in her.<br />&quot;The Double Life of Angela Jones&quot; is a great book for preteens, tackling issues such as social prejudice between rich and poor classes. Even Angela isn't free from being judgmental, but one of the hardest lessons for her to learn from is when her supposed best friend in New York (Denise) shuns her because of her new, &quot;rich&quot; lifestyle.	2001-09-25

A father and son are mysteriously ambushed in a parking lot next to the woods where the swarm seems to have emerged. Dr. Nancy Joyce, a 29-year-old zoologist, is the prime investigator to determine why these typically docile bats attacked. She's later joined by Detective Robert Gentry, a 33-year-old NYPD veteran and charge of the Accident Investigations Squad.<br />Several more bat attacks occur, each growing more violent, and all making a line towards New York City. However, some of the attacks don't seem to have been done by small bats, but a much bigger animal, possibly an abnormally large bat.<br />Their investigation leads them to a radiation specialist who had unknowingly transported a pregnant bat in his luggage on his way back from Russia. The bat (which immediately escaped upon arrival in the U.S. and later died after giving birth) had been exposed to radiation which would explain why her children would be so enormous. The biggest concern now is how many of her offspring are alive.<br />As the story progresses, Dr. Joyce and Detective Gentry pinpoint the two offspring--one female and one male, each protected by thousands of small bats. Apparently, the female is already pregnant and expecting to give birth soon. With the help of New York's best defenses, they set out to destroy these two bats before they have a chance to breed and further prey on humans.<br />&quot;Vespers&quot; is bloody in some parts, so if you're squeamish, I wouldn't recommend reading this one. Otherwise, fans of horror or bats (even though they don't necessarily win in the end) should pick this one up. It's well-written, fast-paced, and all-around entertaining. It's no wonder this book was considered to be made into a movie; it almost felt like I was watching a movie when I was reading it.<br />If you're still hungry for more bat fiction, you might like &quot;Nightwing&quot; by Martin Cruz Smith.	2001-09-25

They meet at a mutual friend's New Year's Eve party. Initially, Kath isn't too impressed with him, but as the night wears on, she finds herself growing more and more attracted to him. Then he shows up the next day and admits he's interested in her.<br />From there, everything's pretty obvious, so I'm not going to prattle on about details and events. They spend countless hours together, going skiing, making out, etc. The sex scenes are explicit (but not trashy) and sometimes funny. You'll understand what I mean when you meet Ralph.<br />Then comes the dreaded summertime when Katherine and Michael are separated by jobs. This is when their relationship is on the line: Does Katherine cheat on Michael or not? Answer: You'll just have to read &quot;Forever&quot; and find out for yourself.<br />When I picked this book up recently, I was surprised to see it was written back in the 70s. Even though it's a 'dinosaur' of a book, the material is pretty much up-to-date about teenage pregnancy and sex. The one thing that's changed over the years is AIDS, which Judy Blume briefly talks about at the beginning of this book. Otherwise, this book will probably be passed on for generations, and the issues will probably still be the same.<br />One complaint: Nobody in this book seemed to have any major hang-ups about sex or birth control. Kath's family and friends were eager and open to talk about sex; Kath's grandmother even gave her birth control advice. Now, I don't know of anyone who could be so lucky, so in that respect &quot;Forever&quot; failed to be realistic.<br />Even though &quot;Forever&quot; is not my favorite Judy Blume book, it's definitely worth reading. If you're pretty comfortable about sex, you'll probably enjoy this book. If not, you'll probably cringe and either burn it or secretly continue reading it.<br />Three years after it was published, &quot;Forever&quot; was made into a TV movie. I wasn't born yet to see it, but from what I heard, I didn't miss much.	2001-09-25

She separates herself from most of the other girls in her class because she thinks they're too weak and silly. Yet she's still friends with two girls, Suzy Kletzel and Darlene Mason, even though she doesn't share their excitement over boys. To Linda, boys are just sports pals, nothing more.<br />Throughout the book, Linda constantly has problems fitting in. She wants to be liked by her two friends (even if they are girls), but she doesn't want her feelings to show for fear bullies like Marvin Haven will tease her.<br />Then when Linda receives a mysterious Valentine poem, she realizes she's starting to have very strange feelings for boys. She even fantasizes about kissing one--yuck! Of course, Linda would never admit this to anyone.<br />So when she's invited to a coed birthday party and the main event is \\"Spin the Bottle\\", Linda quickly hides her insecurity by refusing to participate, which allows the boys to escape as well. All the other girls at the party blame Linda for ruining their chances at being kissed, even her two close friends. Once again, Linda is ostracized by her peers.<br />Linda eventually does learn how to fit in, though not necessarily by giving up on her tomboy nature.<br />&quot;2 Young 2 Go 4 Boys&quot; is a great book for 8 to 12-year-old tomboys, especially ones who are struggling with \\"sissy\\" emotions and their first crush. Even if you don't fit into this category, this is still a good book to read.<br />If you liked this book (and especially Linda Berman), you might like the other books about Linda: Want to Trade Two Brothers for a Cat?, We Hate Everything But Boys, Is There Life After Boys?, We Love Only Older Boys, My Heart Belongs to That Boy, All For the Love of That Boy, Dedicated to That Boy I Love, and Loving Two Is Hard To Do.	2001-09-25
1829118:US	50720905	R1ZPBZX9MVB8L9	055356451X	636592968	Night Sins (Deer Lake)	Books	4	1	4	N	N	Chilly Romantic Thriller	&quot;Night Sins&quot; is about a young boy (Josh Kirkwood) who's been abducted while waiting for his mother to pick him up from hockey practice. It's primarily left up to the two main characters to find out who did it: Megan O'Malley and Mitchell Holt.<br />If you've read any of Tami Hoag's books, you'll know these two characters are destined for attraction before they even meet. Megan is an unmarried field agent for the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension with a large chip on her shoulder, due in part from the gender barrier she's trying to cross in her profession. Mitch is the chief of police of Deer Lake who still grieves for his murdered wife and son, yet still holds on for his young daughter.<br />Other memorable characters are Josh's parents (Hannah Garrison and Paul Kirkwood), whose marriage comes undone under the strain of this ordeal. It's easy to pity Hannah who portrays the grieving mother, and even easier to despise Paul, the self-centered father. A lot of people assume Paul is the kidnapper. Still, others are positive Olie Swain (a known child molester who works at the hockey rink where Josh played) is the pervert responsible. However, only one of these suspects is relatively linked to the abductor, while the other commits suicide with a glass eye (yes, a human eye). Pretty original way to go, I thought.<br />Although I wasn't able to presume a motive, I guessed the kidnapper by page 186. I was excited to finish the book and see if I was right, but I was also a little disappointed. I like to be surprised at the end of a book and there wasn't much for me to be worked up about when my guess was correct. I'm not saying &quot;Night Sins&quot; is predictable, but if you've heard about or read books about kidnapping, you'll know the kidnapper is almost always someone close to the family.<br />As with most of Tami Hoag's books, &quot;Night Sins&quot; is full of details and characters. Sometimes this is a nice change of pace if you're bored with one-dimensional mysteries, but on more than one occasion I was overloaded with characters and descriptions, making it a little difficult to focus on the plot.<br />One more complaint: In one of the sex scenes with Mitch and Megan, Megan is wearing silk underwear, which doesn't seem appropriate considering the below zero temperatures. If this was to show Megan's hidden sexuality, I thought it was poorly conceived and made Megan seem less credible. Even though it's not as sexy as silk, Megan should have been layered in long johns.<br />I would recommend this book to Tami Hoag fans and people who enjoy suspense with a bit of romance. If you've already read &quot;Night Sins&quot; and want to find out how the case ends, continue with &quot;Guilty As Sin&quot;. Otherwise, you'll be left with a lot of unanswered questions.<br />&quot;Night Sins&quot; was later made into a movie in 1997, starring Valerie Bertinelli and Harry Hamlin. I didn't see it, so I'm not sure how good or bad it was.	2001-09-25
1829188:US	50720905	R1XVTMQSKUH4NA	0449911888	470782123	Damage	Books	5	50	57	N	N	Gloomy, Erotic	&quot;Damage&quot; was another book I bought on a whim because it was on sale. I didn't have a clue about the plot since there wasn't a synopsis on the back and most of the reviews inside were pretty vague.<br />To begin with, &quot;Damage&quot; is a pretty small book (218 pages) with short chapters and spare writing. Most people will be able to read it in one day if you have nothing else to do.<br />The book is told in the first person by Stephen Fleming who is a middle-aged politician in British parliament. He leads a very safe, boring life with his beautiful wife Ingrid and two adult children, Martyn and Sally. Everything changes though when he meets his son's new girlfriend, Anna Barton, at a party. His attraction to her is immediate and overpowering. Their affair begins after a few family get-togethers when Anna calls out of the blue and they make arrangements to meet at her place.<br />From the beginning, you know the relationship won't go any further than the bedroom (if they make it that far), but you get swept away anyways in Stephen's loss of control and growing obsession. Anna seems to remain a mystery, however, even after she confesses the strange death of her brother, who had killed himself years ago because he couldn't have her.<br />The ending, of course, is tragic and depressing when Stephen and Anna's affair is discovered. The darkness of the book might be a little too much for some, but if you like gloomy, erotic novels, I highly recommend you read &quot;Damage&quot;.<br />Obviously, there are some sex scenes in the book, but they're not raunchy or overly descriptive. The movie scenes, however, are much more graphic than the book's, especially if you see the unrated version of &quot;Damage&quot;. So, if you're highly offended by incest and adultery, you probably should just skip this one.<br />&quot;Damage&quot; was made into a movie in 1992 (aka &quot;Fatale&quot;), starring Jeremy Irons as Stephen Fleming (who I thought was perfect for the part,especially if you've seen him in &quot;Lolita&quot;) and Juliette Binoche as Anna Barton. Although the movie follows the same structure of the book, I still didn't think the movie was that good, despite the several other great actors and actresses (Rupert Graves, Miranda Richardson). I can't pinpoint what I didn't like about it; I just didn't care for it. I certainly wouldn't recommend the movie unless you're really into the book or a fan of one of the above actors or actresses. Stick to the book instead.	2001-09-25

Janie would have been only three-years-old at the time when she disappeared at a New Jersey shopping mall, possibly stolen by one or both of her parents. The thought seems unimaginable; after all, her parents are the kindest, most perfect people Janie knows. But Janie is almost certain she had to have been kidnapped when she starts having daymares, random memories from her past, of being lead away at the mall by a sweet woman who could have been her mother.<br />For quite a while, Janie keeps her discovery to herself, stressing over the possibility of being kidnapped and wanting to deny it could have ever happened. Then she discovers another secret in the attic--a child's dress, the exact one she was wearing in the missing children's picture, along with a trunk full of another child's belongings. Now Janie has all the evidence she needs; she's positive her parents are horrible people who stole her from her real family. She confronts them, demanding to know why there aren't any baby pictures of herself, where her birth certificate is, and whose trunk is in the attic.<br />Janie's parents reluctantly explain everything. First of all, Janie isn't their child; she's their granddaughter. Janie's mother, Hannah, had run away at sixteen to join the Hare Krishna. When she decided to return for awhile, Hannah brought her daughter back with her and asked her parents to take care of Janie. Janie's new guardians were afraid Hannah's cult would want to take Janie back, so they moved across the country to Connecticut.<br />Almost all of Janie's questions were answered, except she can't ignore the memories of another past family. Were her parents telling the truth, or was she indeed kidnapped, possibly by her 'parent's' brainwashed daughter Hannah?<br />Although I liked &quot;The Face on the Milk Carton&quot;, I was a little confused at times about Janie's theory of what could have happened to her when she was a child. Perhaps the author wanted the reader to be just as confused and lost as Janie so we'd want to find out how this story ends (and it ends abruptly) in &quot;Whatever Happened to Janie?&quot;<br />This is a really great book for all ages, a little confusing, but gripping. You might also like &quot;Sharing Susan&quot; by Eve Bunting (babies switched at birth).<br />&quot;The Face on the Milk Carton&quot; was made into a TV movie a couple years later in 1995, starring Kellie Martin as Janie. I never saw it, but maybe it'll rerun again.	2001-09-25

Andy's leaving her isn't too startling; he's always had a fear of commitment--leaving Meg several times at the altar; panicking over job promotions before finally quitting to become a bookstore owner.<br />Now Meg has the sole responsibility of remodeling and selling their two homes. To make matters worse, an old flame from Meg's college years reenters her life as a buyer for her house. She struggles between falling for her ex-lover who has done a positive 180 personality-wise or remaining true to her deadbeat husband. Tough decision, huh?<br />I highly recommend &quot;Love and Houses&quot;, especially if you're like me and tend to avoid syrupy fiction about marriage disasters. It could have turned into a woe-is-me, depressing book, but it was surprisingly funny and lighthearted. It's well worth finding a copy and owning. You'll definitely want to reread this one.	2001-09-25

Her mother died four years ago (a woman Rachaela didn't mourn) and, many years earlier, her father had abandoned them. Otherwise, she has no family, no friends.<br />Then she is contacted repeatedly by messengers: her father's family want to meet with her, to make amends for his abandoning her all those years ago. Obviously, Rachaela is apprehensive, but when she is mysteriously fired and notified of a future building eviction, she has nowhere else to turn but to these strangers.<br />The House, simply named, is home to the Scarabae (pronounced Scarraby), a group of a dozen or so eccentric family members, including her father Adamus. As her mother had explained to her as a child, the Scarabae are unusual, &quot;darkly ominous&quot; people, which Rachaels discovers is all too true. She also learns their invitation had a more deviant purpose: to mate father with daughter. However, nobody expected the outcome to be so fatal.<br />Dark Dance is the first of three books in the Blood Opera Sequence; &quot;Personal Darkness&quot; and &quot;Darkness, I&quot; follow. This series is so far my favorite Tanith Lee series, as well as my favorite all-time vampire series. It's not as bloody as most present-day vampire books (in fact, there's very little gore; it's more gothic than violent), but if you're a big vampire fan (which I am), I would recommend you read all three books.<br />As fair warning, there are some sex scenes between father and daughter that might offend some readers.<br />If you've already read the Blood Opera Sequence, you might like Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles or Lives of the Mayfair Witches. Both series are somewhat alike to Tanith Lee's tale of the Scarabae, that is, if Anne Rice had merged her vampire world with her witch world.<br />I also recommend reading &quot;The Kiss&quot; by Kathryn Reines if you like vampires.	2001-09-25

The moment they leave Philadelphia, Colin insists they're being followed by a van. At first it's a game for Alex and Colin, a way to pass time and get to know each other. But when the van continues to follow them out of state, they soon realize it's not just a coincidence--the man is chasing them, waiting for his chance to attack.<br />The man is George Leland, a delusional psycho who carries on conversations with his imaginary ex-girlfriend Courtney, who he believes still loves him. George decides he must get rid of the competition before they reach California so he can have Courtney to himself.<br />&quot;Shattered&quot; is a great thriller about a crazy, jealous ex-boyfriend who stalks his ex's new husband and baby brother on a cross-country drive. This is one of Dean Koontz's earlier books and wasn't even published under his original name until 1985. The pen name he had used was K. R. Dwyer.<br />&quot;Shattered&quot; isn't like his other high-tech / supernatural suspense novels, which was a relief. I'm more of a fan of Dean Koontz's pseudonym books, like &quot;Face of Fear&quot;, which are simple--yet exciting--action novels.	2001-09-25

He has no plans of drawing attention to himself right away, but that plan quickly evaporates when a senior, Carl Riemer, befriends him and encourages him to run for class president. From the beginning Carl is in charge and you can almost see the strings he attaches to Bob.<br />Although Bob loses the election, it doesn't discourage him from joining the tennis team or playing in the school band. He soon falls for Sarah Ott, who at the time is dating a jock (Eric Lombard) and &quot;just wants to be friends&quot; with Bob. Sarah's best friend Renee Webb, however, is interested in Bob. He returns the feelings half-heartedly, but uses her mostly as a link to Sarah.<br />&quot;Coming About&quot; mainly focus on Bob and Carl's friendship, if you can call it that. A lot of the time Bob is trying to avoid Carl, and who can blame him? Carl has a strange obsession with Admiral Horatio Nelson and war. He's also a chronic liar, but makes a one-lie policy with Bob; he will only lie once to Bob, which I thought was the lie, but it's not. I won't reveal what it is though, in case you want to find out for yourself.<br />More strange behavior: Once Carl weasels himself into the Royle home, he begins calling Bob's mother &quot;Mom&quot;, which I thought was a little bit weird, especially when nobody corrects him. I suppose Carl's &quot;adopting&quot; Ms. Royle was his way of feeling close to an adult since his own home life is so messed up.<br />It took awhile for me to warm up to this book because it skips around quite a bit. However, it's a fast read (short chapters, lots of dialogue, and only 185 pages) and an overall good book.<br />The intended audience is 13 to 15-year-old boys (which I'm not), but I still really liked it and would recommend &quot;Coming About&quot; to anyone who likes reading about teen life, particularly if you have an eccentric friend like Carl.	2001-09-25

One death in particular brings Tessa Lockland to Moonlight Cove: the death of her sister, Janice Capshaw. Although Janice's death had been labeled as a suicide, Tessa just can't believe her sister could have killed herself.<br />Sam Booker is another newcomer to Moonlight Cove. He's an undercover FBI agent sent to the coastal Californian town to investigate the other mysterious deaths similar to Janice Capshaw's. Tessa and Sam later hook up about halfway through the book when they're both being chased by bloodthirsty creatures that could possibly pass as werewolves. (At first that's what I thought this book was about: werewolves preying on a little West Coast town. Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple.)<br />Sam and Tessa finally take refuge at a wheelchair-bound veteran's house (Harry Talbot) with his guide dog Moose. Chrissie Foster is the fourth and last addition to the group. She's an 11-year-old who barely escaped being eaten by her parents who had succumbed to their monstrous forms.<br />These creatures that are running amok in Moonlight Cove are a genetic experiment created by Thomas Shaddock. He sets out to transform the entire community by injecting everyone with a microscopic computer chip that alters their body chemistry, thus enabling them to regress into any kind of beast, insect, or machine they want. Needless to say, the experiment goes haywire when the New People (the term for the &quot;converted&quot; people) remain in their altered states and start killing for primal sport.<br />This book took me several months to read mainly because I don't like sci-fi / biotechnology stories, even if Dean Koontz writes them. A few chapters into &quot;Midnight&quot; I knew I'd be giving this book a poor rating, but I decided it deserved at least three stars since it was well-written, although painfully long and slow. Unless you're really a big Dean Koontz fan or into biological thrillers, I'd avoid this one.Koontz fan or into biological thrillers, I'd avoid this one.	2001-09-25

Martin), everybody in the BSC had a chance to share their fun and excitement in New York. This is definitely a must-read for BSC fans, especially those who love the Big Apple.	2001-09-25

They're generally very open with her, but their sudden secrecy has Susan upset and panicked. She suspects her parents are either getting a divorce or have lost their jobs and they have to move. However, Susan doesn't realize it's much worse.<br />Her parents sit her down one evening and lay it all out. Susan was switched with another baby girl at the hospital when she was born, and now Susan's real parents, the Stobbels, want a chance to prove if she's their daughter or not.<br />The Stobbels' had discovered Marlene Stobbel wasn't their own daughter when they were rejected as donors after Marlene was hit by a truck and went into a coma. She eventually died. Afterwards, the Stobbels contacted the hospital where Marlene and Susan were born at and got in touch with the Morettis.<br />Susan, naturally, doesn't want a new family (two new parents and a four-year-old brother). She's afraid they want to take her away from her parents forever, but her parents assure her nothing that  drastic will happen, although they don't know that for sure.<br />Everything depends upon the results of the blood tests, which confirm Susan is the Stobbel's daughter. As a result, they want to meet Susan before eventually taking custody of her. Her parents are agreeable to the meeting--after all, there's nothing they can do otherwise--, but Susan is scared and resists it. She tries to be as difficult and callous as possible so the Stobbels won't want her. She even shaves off her eyebrows to hide any resemblance she has with her real father. (They both have a hairless line through their right eyebrow.) This doesn't seem to change their mind about wanting her, and Susan realizes she can't go on forever resisting her new family.<br />&quot;Sharing Susan&quot; is a great book for preteens. If you like books about mistaken families, youmight also like &quot;The Face on the Milk Carton&quot; by Caroline B. Cooney (kidnapping).	2001-09-25
1829711:US	50720905	R39ALS60U21HE5	0312853505	967602189	The Count of Eleven	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Predictable, Tedious	Jack Orchard lives in New Brighton, England, with his wife (Julia) and 12-year-old daughter (Laura). He's a fairly successful video store owner (Fine Films), but considers himself foremost a loving and attentive husband and father. He would do anything to protect them and make them happy--and does just about everything.<br />At the beginning of \\"The Count of Eleven\\", Jack's luck starts to run out when a series of misfortunes occur one after the other: his uninsured store burns down, his credit card is stolen and charged to its limit, and now he's losing his house. Nothing could be worse. So when he receives a chain letter promising him good luck if he sends out thirteen duplicated letters, Jack's superstitious nature overtakes him and he immediately follows through with it. All the while, he follows an obsessive routine of counting numbers. Anything that equals eleven he considers lucky.<br />However, when his luck doesn't turn around, Jack can only conclude that it's not himself who's to blame, but the recipients. They must not have continued the cycle by sending out their thirteen letters. So, Jack visits every person he had sent letters to. Those who admittedly refuse to continue the foolish chain are killed with a blowtorch, Jack's weapon of choice. Or rather, I should say, the Count's weapon of choice since Jack's alter ego is the guy in charge most of the time.<br />On and on these visits go, until the pursuits became predictable and tedious, taking up a good third of the book which would have been better if they had been omitted or at least shortened.<br />\\"The Count of Eleven\\" wasn't too terrible, but it wasn't what I expected either. It's not scary or a full-fledged horror novel. I thought the front cover was a little misleading with the blood coming out of an envelope since there was no real bloodshed, just a couple attacks with a blowtorch that were more humorous than anything else. But the ending at least was decent enough, so I figured it deserved threestars instead of a two.<br />I would only recommend this book to Ramsey Campbell fans and people who like soft English horror that is more character-oriented than violent.	2001-09-25
