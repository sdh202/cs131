Abler, who also contributes an introduction and notes.  The primary text is a first-person account by a Seneca Indian chief who fought during the American Revolution, and delivered his story orally to another Indian who committed it to writing.  In addition to providing an overall introduction for the book, editor Abler also has written individual introductions for each section of the Blacksnake narrative.  This supplemental material helps place Blacksnake's words in context.<br /><br />Abler discusses in detail the background and history of the Blacksnake manuscript.  He notes that this text \\"provides a rare Indian view of warfare and of diplomacy in a period when the Six Nations of the Iroquois still played a prominent and significant role in the development of North America\\" (p. 8).  Abler discusses Blacksnake's family, his names, his people's culture, the Iroquois Confederacy as a political entity, and relations among the British, the revolutionary colonists, and Native Americans.  It's a fascinating backdrop for Blacksnake's own story.<br /><br />Blacksnake's own words show conflict within the Indian community, relations with white people, and the role of Indian women.  He describes combat involving firearms, tomahawks, knives, and the \\"war whoop.\\"  Also covered in the book is the religious vision and career of Blacksnake's uncle, the prophet Handsome Lake.  Appendices to the primary text include an intriguing series of communications between George Washington and Seneca leaders.<br /><br />Abler notes that the Blacksnake/Williams text is written in \\"somewhat individualistic English\\"; I imagine many contemporary readers will find the text quite difficult, and will be thankful for Abler's clearly written supplementary text.  The text is also enhanced by a wealth of visual materials, including maps, a daguerreotype of the elderly Blacksnake, reproductions of historic illustrations of other Indian leaders, photographs of historic wampum belts, and more.  Also worthy of note is the extensive bibliography.  This is a fascinating book, but I found it to be tragic and sad; it seems to me that in the main text and supplemental materials we can see the decline of the Iroquois Confederacy from a true military and political force to a marginalized people.  Despite this downbeat aspect, the book is a real tribute to Blacksnake, Handsome Lake, and other remarkable Indian leaders.  Overall, Abler has assembled a valuable contribution to both Native American studies and United States military history.

The book also includes a biographical essay on the poet (pages 155-59).  The essay notes that she was born in Poland in 1923 and received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1996.  The essay also describes the challenges she faced as a writer under the communist regime that ruled Poland for decades.  Also featured in the book are reproductions of whimsical collages created by Szymborska.<br /><br />This is a rich and varied collection of poems.  I was particularly struck by the author's wit, humor, and often biting satire.  At times her work is graced by touches of the surreal or fantastic.  Her voice can be both compassionate towards, and sharply critical of, humanity.  Overall the book demonstrates her skill at using a variety of writerly techniques: direct address, personification, parallel structures, historical allusion, dialogue, and paradox.  In her poetry she draws on the language of mathematics and other disciplines.<br /><br />I found some of the most striking poems in the collection to be the following.  \\"Commemoration\\": written in the form a charmingly iconoclastic prayer.  \\"A Man's Household\\": a gentle and humorous satire of a man devoted to fix-it-yourself projects.  \\"Starvation Camp at Jaslo\\": a cutting meditation on injustice and suffering that employs biting, grim satire.  \\"The Turn of the Century\\": uses personification as a technique to look back critically at the 20th century (\\"Its years are numbered,/ its step unsteady\\").  \\"Torture\\": employs particularly powerful language as she looks at the title phenomenon.<br /><br />Also worthy of note--\\"Water\\": finds a globe-encompassing revelation in a single drop of water.  \\"A Word on Statistics\\": a cleverly structured, witty satire that leads to a real kicker of an ending.  \\"Pi\\": a poem about the mathematical concept of the title.  \\"Miracle Fair\\": a witty and wonderful piece that reminds me of the style and spirit of Pablo Neruda's great work \\"The Book of Questions.\\"  \\"Poetry Reading\\": pokes gentle fun at the poetic vocation.<br /><br />The book as a whole is clearly the work of a skilled and confident master craftsperson who has a real passion to share her vision.  Hers is a complex and compelling voice, at times grimly serious, at times playful and childlike.  A number of her poems seem to invite the reader to partake of a dramatically altered, even magical perspective--a fresh and even radical new way of looking at the world around us.  Her poems on violence and human suffering have a political edge and moral power that remind me of the work of Audre Lorde.  And some of her poetry reminds me of Buddhist or Taoist thought--specifically, of teachings on emptiness and nonstriving.  At her most luminous, Szymborska strikes me as firmly in the great tradition of poet-prophets exemplified by Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Langston Hughes, and other great voices.ful piece that reminds me of the style and spirit of Pablo Neruda's great work \\"The Book of Questions.\\"  \\"Poetry Reading\\": pokes gentle fun at the poetic vocation.<br /><br />The book as a whole is clearly the work of a skilled and confident master craftsperson who has a real passion to share her vision.

I found the book to be a fascinating, illuminating, well-written, and surprisingly sober account of a most remarkable life journey.  Merritt describes how he came from a fundamentalist Christian background, served in the United States Marine Corps, came to grips with his identity as a gay man, appeared in gay pornographic films, and descended into a nightmare of sexual promiscuity and illegal drug use.<br /><br />Merritt offers windows into a variety of communities and subcultures.  Particularly interesting is Merritt's account of his attendance at Bob Jones Elementary School, Bob Jones Academy, and Bob Jones University--all bastions of extreme Christian fundamentalism.  The author's account of his journey through the gay porn industry gives an interesting view of some of the personalities and practical issues involved in the business.  Also noteworthy is his account of his time at law school and the beginning of his post-Marine Corps legal career.<br /><br />But it is Merritt's often gripping account of life as a closeted gay Marine that I found to be the most impactful aspect of this memoir.  Merritt's USMC career spans from the mid-1980s to the latter 1990s, a time of significant challenge and change for America's military forces.  Merritt gives insight into the realities of gay Marine life before and after codification of the controversial \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" policy.  He writes about gay Marines' paranoia and survival tactics, as well as the presence of an underground gay military network.  Merritt's career includes shipboard service in the Persian Gulf, command time, and a tour as a Marine general's aide; particularly interesting is his colorful portrait of the general for whom he worked.  His account of his efforts to challenge the military's policy on gays through the media is also worthy of note.<br /><br />Supplementing the text are numerous photographs covering the author's time at the Bob Jones schools, in the Marine Corps, in the gay porn business, and after leaving military service.  Merritt's Bob Jones background and connections are persistent presences throughout the memoir.  Overall, I found the book to be a consistently interesting account of bouncing back and forth between cultural extremes.  It's also a story about the universal experiences of searching for love, happiness, belonging, and a sense of identity.  Merritt's story raises interesting questions about the media's role in the gays-in-the-military issue, and about the search for gay military role models and icons.  Overall, this is a compelling Marine memoir and, in particular, a serious addition to the growing body of books dealing with the gays-in-the-military issue.y of note.<br /><br />Supplementing the text are numerous photographs covering the author's time at the Bob Jones schools, in the Marine Corps, in the gay porn business, and after leaving military service.

The copyright page notes that an earlier edition of the book was published under the title \\"African Rhapsody: Short Stories from the Contemporary African Experience\\" in 1994.  The stories take up 369 pages of text, making for an average length of about 11 pages each; the longest story, Charles Mungoshi's \\"The Brother,\\" is only 26 pages long.  An illuminating foreword by Chinua Achebe gives some literary and historic context for the short story genre in Africa.<br /><br />This is a rich, diverse collection.  There are several selections by women writers.  The editor has included both stories written in English and stories translated into English.  The writers represent many African nations: Sudan, Mozambique, South Africa, Benin, Nigeria, Morocco, Ethiopia, and more.  Among the many topics covered by the stories are economics, the supernatural, family ties across generations, sex, addiction, the role of domestic workers, language, race relations, marriage, capital punishment, AIDS, education, and war.  I was particularly intrigued by the stories showing the role of Islam in African lives.<br /><br />There are many noteworthy selections in this anthology.  \\"The Prophetess,\\" by Njabulo S. Ndebele, is about a boy on a mission to acquire holy water from the title character.  \\"It Was Easter Sunday the Day I Went to Netreg,\\" by Sindiwe Magona, shows three generations of women in an African family as they confront a serious family crisis.  \\"Hot Days, Long Nights,\\" by Nnadozie F. Inyama, offers intriguing glimpses of both the marketplace and the nightlife of the city of Akassa.  \\"Her Three Days,\\" by Sembene Ousmane, is a disturbing look at the wife of a polygamist.<br /><br />\\"The Three-Piece Suit,\\" by Ali Deb, is a compact but biting satire of conspicuous consumerism.  \\"The Wicked Tongue,\\" by Mohammed Moulessehoul, is a parable-like tale of justice; this story is also noteworthy for its Islamic setting.  \\"God of Meme,\\" by Ndeley Mokoso, looks at the conflict between a crocodile cult and local officials.  \\"Africa Kills Her Sun,\\" by Ken Saro-Wiwa, is written in the form of a letter from a death-row inmate.  In \\"The Waldiba Story,\\" by Hama Tuma, a monk tells his story to a doctor serving with guerrilla forces.  But my favorite story in the collection is \\"The Museum,\\" by Leila Aboulela, which looks at the experiences of a Sudanese woman studying abroad in Scotland; this is a wonderful, vividly written piece that left me wanting to continue following the characters.<br /><br />My only complaint about the anthology involves the editor's \\"Introduction to the Second Edition\\" (pages xi-xii).  She ruins a number of the stories by revealing the endings--in my opinion, this is one of the worst offenses an anthology editor can commit.  So I recommend that readers refrain from reading this introduction until after they have read all the stories.  Overall, this is a powerful and rewarding collection which I highly recommend for classroom use, for reading groups, and for individual readers.justice; this story is also noteworthy for its Islamic setting.  \\"God of Meme,\\" by Ndeley Mokoso, looks at the conflict between a crocodile cult and local officials.  \\"Africa Kills Her Sun,\\" by Ken Saro-Wiwa, is written in the form of a letter from a death-row inmate.

In the book's opening chapter, Linn vividly sketches out the complex environment faced by the U.S. Army as it began its occupation of the Philippines after Spain's defeat.  Linn discusses the different sociopolitical factions in Philippine society, the ethnic divisions, the revolutionary Katipunan society, religious rebel groups, and bandit gangs.  He also begins to create his picture of the structure of the guerrilla forces faced by the U.S. troops.<br /><br />As the book progresses, Linn looks at the shape of both the insurgency and U.S. counterinsurgency activity in different parts of the Philippines.  He covers many important topics: the insurgent infrastructure that supported the anti-U.S. guerrillas, the impact of terrain on U.S. operations, how disease affected U.S. troops, the use of terrorism by insurgent forces, the U.S. Army's use of native Filipino auxiliary forces, and American efforts in the areas of civil government and public works.  He emphasizes the role of military intelligence in the conflict, and offers intriguing analysis of the leadership on both sides of the war.  Along the way he introduces us to some truly remarkable personalities, both Filipino and American.<br /><br />Linn's book is meticulously documented.  The main text (pages 1-170) is followed by extensive endnotes (171-234) and a substantial bibliography (235-47).  The bibliography cites a rich diversity of source material, including manuscript collections, letters, diaries, veterans' questionnaires, books, dissertations, and government publications.  The text is further enhanced by an index, six illuminating maps, and eight pages of black-and-white photographs depicting people on both sides of the conflict.  The book is written in a clear, logical manner; Linn emphasizes facts and incorporates quotes from primary sources into his text.  He successfully maintains a tone of scholarly impartiality, even when discussing potentially sensational and controversial material.<br /><br />In his preface, Linn notes that it is the \\"diversity, both in the Filipino resistance and the American response, that makes the Philippine War so fascinating.\\"  As I read this masterful work of history, I was struck, over and over again, by what I saw as parallels between the Philippine War and the contemporary Iraq War.  Indeed, I consider this book essential reading for those who wish to learn more about issues in military occupation, insurgency, and guerrilla warfare.successfully maintains a tone of scholarly impartiality, even when discussing potentially sensational and controversial material.<br /><br />In his preface, Linn notes that it is the \\"diversity, both in the Filipino resistance and the American response, that makes the Philippine War so fascinating.\\"  As I read this masterful work of history, I was struck, over and over again, by what I saw as parallels between the Philippine War and the contemporary Iraq War.

The book features a foreword by Margarethe Cammermeyer (who tells her own story of being a lesbian in the U.S. Army in the book \\"Serving in Silence\\").  An \\"About the Author\\" paragraph at the start of the book identifies Shawver as a clinical psychologist who has worked as a psychotherapist for 20 years.  This paragraph also notes, \\"She served as an expert in the Canadian review of their ban on homosexuals in the military and was influential in the lifting of that ban in October 1992.\\"<br /><br />The main text of the book is divided into nine chapters, as follows:<br /><br />1.  \\"Why the Military Would Ban Homosexuals\\"<br /><br />2.  \\"The Question of Heterosexual Modesty\\"<br /><br />3.  \\"Nakedness and the Etiquette of Disregard\\"<br /><br />4.  \\"Why Some People Dislike Gays\\"<br /><br />5.  \\"The Problem with Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\"<br /><br />6.  \\"How Many Homosexuals Are There Really?\\"<br /><br />7.  \\"How Would Homosexuals Affect Morale?\\"<br /><br />8.  \\"Stories of Real People Hurt by the Ban\\"<br /><br />9.  \\"How It Would Work in Our Post Cold War Military\\"<br /><br />Shawver states her position in her preface: \\"I have become increasingly confident that it is time for the United States to drop our military ban against homosexuals.\\"  Shawver has clearly been diligent in documenting the facts that support her argument.  The main text is followed by extensive endnotes (pages 155-214), many of which incorporate substantial quotes.  These endnotes are followed by a lengthy bibliography (pages 215-249).  The book also includes separate subject and name indexes.<br /><br />The book is full of interesting material and compelling arguments.  Shawver devotes substantial space to the concern that problems would result from gay and straight troops sharing shower facilities.  She looks at parallels to other nudity situations in order to defuse the issue.  She also relates and analyzes some true stories of gay people who have served in the military, and whom she has interviewed; she details her interview process in the endnotes.<br /><br />Shawver takes a hard look at the process by which suspected homosexuals are investigated.  Among the most interesting material in the book are a fictionalized example of an interrogation session, and a true story of a wily gay military man who managed to outwit his interrogators.  Shawver also discusses the experiences of a woman, herself gay, who worked for the Naval Investigative Service and was responsible for interrogating others suspected of homosexuality--truly an ironic situation.<br /><br />Despite much strong material and many valid arguments, the book is severely hurt by Shawver's shortsighted and excessive intellectual investment in her vision of a post-Cold War \\"New World Order.\\"  With a copyright date of 1995, the book predates the horrors of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  So Shawver's claim that we \\"are freed from the urgency of a threatening enemy\\" (p. 152) makes the book sound like a relic from an era that is past.  Her argument is that this new era of relative peace and security offers an opportunity to \\"redesign\\" the military.  Shawver is correct in noting that the post-Cold War military needs to be more capable of humanitarian interventions (she specifically mentions the Somalia intervention of the early 1990s) and other nontraditional missions, but her conflation of this issue with the gays-in-the-military issues is awkward and uses faulty logic.<br /><br />Early in the book Shawver claims, \\"We can count on the fact that our military will be primarily concerned in this new world with a peacemaking role\\" (p. 13).  Obviously, the 21st century U.S. military still needs to be capable of engaging and destroying enemy forces.  Shawver's over-reliance on the short-lived \\"New World Order\\" ultimately weakens the overall book and detracts from the many valid arguments and compelling stories she presents.  Despite the book's flaws, however, I strongly recommend it to any individual making a serious study of the gays-in-the-military issue.iance on the short-lived \\"New World Order\\" ultimately weakens the overall book and detracts from the many valid arguments and compelling stories she presents.

Haney, is a gripping book written by one of the organization's founding members.  Haney retired from the U.S. Army as a Command Sergeant Major with over 20 years service.  Early in the book Haney introduces the reader to Delta Force founder Colonel Charlie Beckwith, who had a vision of \\"a compact, highly skilled, and versatile unit able to undertake and execute difficult and unusual 'special' missions.\\"<br /><br />Haney describes in detail how, starting from Colonel Beckwith's vision, Delta Force was created from scratch.  An early section of the book describes the torturous tests used on candidates for the newly forming unit.  He also reveals the elements that Delta Force's creators drew upon as they shaped the emerging organization.  Fundamentally modeled on the British Special Air Service commando organization, the new force drew its research and training from many sources: Secret Service snipers, Delta Airlines, the Department of Energy's Nuclear Emergency Search Teams, a veteran CIA agent, and more, including convicted criminals who provided insights into breaching and demolitions.  We get to see how each ingredient is added into the potent mix.  This glimpse into Delta Force's \\"DNA\\" is absolutely fascinating.  Equally gripping is Haney's account of the actual training received by selectees for the new unit; the training includes a detailed espionage exercise that reads like something out of a suspense novel.<br /><br />A high point in the book is the official \\"birth\\" of the new Delta Force as \\"a fully grown and reasoning predator, armed with fangs and claws and intelligence, able to run and to fight.\\"  Haney takes the reader beyond this milestone and into many missions undertaken by himself and other Delta Force operators: the botched attempt to rescue American hostages from Iran, an anti-sniper mission in Beirut, a seagoing countersmuggling operation off the coast of Central America, and more.  Particularly interesting is Haney's account of the U.S. invasion of Grenada during the Reagan years; this section of the book includes a particularly powerful description of a combat helicopter assault.<br /><br />I have read many military memoirs and historical accounts, and this book stands out in a number of ways.  Its exploration of the building of a brand new unit from ground up is striking and important.  Also significant is the glimpse Haney offers us into what he calls \\"Mr. Reagan's secret wars in Central America,\\" which the author further notes \\"were always merciless affairs.\\"  The book is very well written; Haney particularly shines in the mode of storyteller.  He is equally skilled at describing colorful, heroic personalities and intense scenes of violence and destruction.  Haney includes a post-9/11 postscript in which he offers words of encouragement to the reader.  I highly recommend this book to those who love military nonfiction.America, and more.

This 70-page volume contains four poems: the title poem (pages 1 to 17), \\"Watersteps\\" (19 to 37), \\"Poem on Death\\" (39 to 48), and \\"Meeting\\" (49 to 70).  The back cover identifies the author as \\"one of Europe's most revered poets.\\"  This is a monolingual volume, with only the English versions given; I must say that even though I can't read Danish, I wish the editors had presented a bilingual edition so that readers could at least see what the Danish versions of the poems look like.<br /><br />I must admit--I found this book very hard to connect with on my first reading, but I stuck with Christensen and began to get more out of the book upon repeated readings of the poems.  The back cover features a quote from Eliot Weinberger, who describes Christensen as \\"a formalist who makes her own rules, then turns the game around with another rule.\\"  Indeed, I found Christensen's polished use of varied forms to be the most striking aspect of this volume.  Each of the four poems has a precise structure that is totally distinct from those of the other poems in the book.<br /><br />The title poem is described on the back cover as a sonnet cycle.  Although the English versions don't have a discernable rhyme scheme, each division of the poem does have a precise 14-line structure.  The overall cycle is masterfully designed, and the full unity and complexity of its structure is powerfully revealed with the final section.  It's a real triumph of form.  The poem seems to envision butterflies as a complex and multifaceted metaphor.  The language is often strikingly beautiful, and often has great visual appeal.  The next poem, \\"Watersteps,\\" blends suspense and surrealism as it takes the reader to the fountains of Rome.  It is structured as a sort of staccato prose poem, and has an odd, unsettling rhythm.  The language in \\"Watersteps\\" is precise and matter-of-fact, drawing from the language of history and architecture; it's a stunning contrast with the lush, sweeping language of the previous poem.<br /><br />\\"Poem on Death\\" is divided into dozens of short, haiku-like stanzas.  This poem is not just about death, but also about writing, writer's block, and words themselves.  The final poem, \\"Meeting,\\" is written in a sort of prose-poem form that reminds me of Allen Ginsberg's classic \\"Howl.\\"  \\"Meeting\\" contains some striking and disturbing imagery.  At points in the poem Christensen seems to be deconstructing the use and nature of words themselves.  Overall, I did not find this book wholly satisfying.  I found the final two poems in particular just too obscure.  Still, there is much in this volume that is appealing and thought-provoking.

The novel follows his experiences with a band of guerrilla fighters as he undertakes a mission to blow up a strategic bridge.  The whole novel, except for some flashbacks and reminiscences of various characters, covers just a few days.<br /><br />Although the novel focuses on a small number of characters in a fairly compressed time period, Hemingway attains a real epic feel with this book.  The novel is fairly lengthy (471 pages in the 2003 Scribner edition), but I found it to be a swift read--indeed, often difficult to put down.  There is much that is noteworthy about this novel.  It offers a compelling perspective on war from the viewpoint of guerrilla forces, rather than conventional forces (interested readers might want to check out Mao Tse-Tung's \\"On Guerrilla Warfare\\" for some theoretical and historical perspective).  The novel also deals with the phenomenon of ideologically committed foreign forces in Spain's Fascist-versus-Republican conflict.<br /><br />Hemingway deals with the issues of love and sex in a combat zone, as well as with the roles of women in a guerrilla force.  Other significant issues include loyalty, leadership, communications, military hardware, the impact of weather and terrain, and the connection between guerrilla and conventional forces.  Particularly interesting is Hemingway's portrait of Robert Jordan as a technically and tactically skilled guerrilla fighter, and as a leader of guerrilla fighters.  Thus the book should interest not just lovers of literature, but also serious military professionals and students of the history of warfare.<br /><br />Hemingway offers a grim and graphic look at the brutality of 20th century warfare.  War is not glamorized or sanitized, and atrocities are described in unflinching detail.  The characters explore the ethics of killing in war.  As the story progresses, Hemingway skillfully peels back the layers of Jordan and other characters to reveal their psychological wounds.  But the book is not all about pain and violence.  In the midst of war Hemingway finds the joy and beauty that keep his characters going.  He also incorporates storytelling as a powerful motif in the book; his characters share stories with each other, recall missing untold stories, or resist a story too hard to bear.  In Hemingway's world storytelling is as essential a human activity as eating, fighting, and lovemaking.<br /><br />Hemingway's writing appeals to all the senses as he creates some vivid scenes.  He demonstrates his mastery of the art of fiction; he continually makes interesting choices and creates some really striking and beautiful passages.  \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is an exceptionally haunting work of literature; I consider this rich and rewarding text to be an essential volume in the canon of war fiction.  For intriguing companion texts that also deal with the Spanish Civil War, I recommend \\"Spain's Cause Was Mine: A Memoir of an American Medic in the Spanish Civil War,\\" by Hank Rubin, and \\"The Confessions of Senora Francesca Navarro and Other Stories,\\" by Natalie L.

Starting with the S.S. _Mayaguez_ incident off the coast of Cambodia in 1975, Huchthausen tells the story of many missions: the failed 1980 attempt to rescue hostages in Iran, intervention in Lebanon in the 1980s, the 1983 Grenada invasion, the 1986 attack on Libya, activities in the Persian Gulf in the late 1980s, intervention in Panama in 1989, Operation Desert Shield (1990-91) and the 1991 Gulf War, the 1991 relief effort on behalf of the Kurds of northern Iraq, actions in Somalia in the early 1990s, intervention in Bosnia in the 1990s, and the 1999 Kosovo campaign.<br /><br />The book is full of good features: logical organization, more than a dozen clear and informative maps, several pages of black-and-white photographs, a comprehensive nine-page bibliography, and an index.  Huchthausen's prose style is clear and to-the-point.  A paragraph about the author notes that he is a retired U.S. Navy captain, and that he served as an analyst of the Soviet navy, a submarine expert, and a naval attache.  In his introduction Huchthausen notes that the phrase \\"splendid little war\\" was used in 1898, by a U.S. ambassador, to describe the Spanish-American War (incidentally, Theodore Roosevelt's classic memoir of that war, \\"The Rough Riders,\\" would make a great companion text for this book).  Huchthausen notes the irony of his book's title: \\"The U.S. military encounters from 1975 to 1999 were neither splendid nor small.\\"<br /><br />Huchthausen offers gripping descriptions of the unfolding events, both political and military, of each \\"little war.\\"  He gives historical backgrounds for the conflicts and also provides interesting analyses of the U.S. actions.  Significant recurring themes include relations between the press and the military, the combination of assets from different branches of the U.S. military, and the use of unconventional forces such as Navy SEALs and the Army's Delta Force.  We get glimpses of some fascinating personalities: U.S. Admiral William J. Crowe, Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, Somali warlord Muhammad Farah Aideed, Grenadian Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, and more.  In an afterword (to the 2004 edition), Huchthausen reflects on more recent U.S. wars in Afghanistan (since 2001) and Iraq (since 2003).<br /><br />Yes, one can only fit so much information into the relatively short space allotted to each \\"little war,\\" and at times I felt that the book didn't give a full enough story.  Still, as a general overview of this era the book is very useful, and the excellent bibliography offers interested readers plenty more places to go if he or she wants to learn more.  For additional companion texts that cover some of the same material from other valuable perspectives, I recommend \\"Warrior Soul: The Memoir of a Navy SEAL,\\" by Chuck Pfarrer, and \\"Inside Delta Force,\\" by Eric Haney.  Overall, I consider \\"America's Splendid Little Wars\\" a well-written and valuable book--in particular, essential reading for contemporary military professionals.branches of the U.S. military, and the use of unconventional forces such as Navy SEALs and the Army's Delta Force.

Walker's technique for compiling this book was to interview the featured women and turn the transcripts of the interviews into chapters.  One chapter is drawn from a dual interview of two of the women, and another chapter consists of a letter written by a woman whom Walker did not get to interview.  The book is full of black-and-white photographs that further document the women's service in Vietnam.  Also noteworthy is the stirring foreword by entertainer Martha Raye, who briefly discusses her own experiences in Vietnam.<br /><br />Most of the women featured were Army nurses, but the book also includes women who served as WACs, Red Cross personnel, a civilian flight attendant, a USO worker, and more.  There are some significant recurring themes that connect a number of chapters: the experience of being under hostile fire; men, women, sex, and dating in the war zone; encounters with the Vietnamese people; fun and recreation in Vietnam; challenges the women faced in doing their jobs in a war zone; and personal and psychological problems some of the women faced after returning home from Vietnam.  Also, two of the women discuss possible Agent Orange-connected health problems faced by children they had after serving.<br /><br />There are some extremely graphic and disturbing accounts by some of the nurses as they recall the horrific injuries suffered by their patients, as well as their own struggles to deliver compassionate care in the combat zone environment.  There are many other noteworthy memories, some heartbreaking, some funny.  Army nurse Pat Johnson describes painting the barracks \\"red-and-white striped with pink polka dots.\\"  Entertainer Bobbi Jo Pettit recalls touring Vietnam as part of an all-girl band called \\"The Pretty Kittens.\\"  Navy nurse Maureen Walsh delivers a vivid account of an enemy rocket attack at Da Nang.<br /><br />The voices of these women strike many tones: feisty, introspective, proud, caring.  I was especially moved by the memories of post-war reunions and experiences at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.  I consider this book to be an absolutely essential complement to the many fine works, both fiction and nonfiction, written by male Vietnam veterans.  Recommended as a companion text: Wallace Terry's \\"Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans,\\" which is similar in both format and impact to this book.my rocket attack at Da Nang.<br /><br />The voices of these women strike many tones: feisty, introspective, proud, caring.

100018:US	51987970	RRW3XK8AB4E0K	1570627398	300373847	The Pocket Rumi Reader (Shambhala Pocket Classics)	Books	5	16	16	N	N	A mystical yet earthy poetic voice	\\"The Pocket Rumi Reader, \\" edited by Kabir Helminski, collects poetry written by Mevlana Jalaludin Rumi, described in the book's introduction as \\"a thirteenth-century Islamic saint.\\"  The poetry is divided up into three sections: rubaiyat (a form of lyric poetry), ghazels (another poetic form), and selections from Rumi's \\"Mathnawi\\" (a collection of couplets).  The translations (from Persian) are by Helminski and others.<br /><br />Rumi's great theme throughout this book is the relationship between humankind and the divine.  The poetry is full of rich imagery and marvelous turns of phrase; many of the poems have a parable-like quality.  The book is very much rooted in Islamic tradition; along the way Rumi mentions Muhammad, sufis, dervishes, the Quran, and Quranic figures such as Jesus and Mary.  But the book also attains a universal quality; Rumi's insights and observations strike me as particularly relevant to Christians and Jews, and at times his voice even reminds me of the Taoist, Buddhist, or Greek Stoic traditions.<br /><br />Rumi effectively draws on the tangible phenomena of the world in his poetic imagery: an oyster shell, apples, iron, grapes, a reed flute, and buttermilk are among the things the reader encounters.  At his best he invites us to view such down-to-earth things with a fresh new perspective.  Some of the individual poems that struck me the most are as follows.  \\"This Marriage\\": a beautiful wedding blessing.  \\"Intellect is a Shackle\\": conveys a potent spiritual lesson.  \\"To Clutch at Madness\\": a celebration of the unconventional path, this poem reminded me of some of Emily Dickinson's work.  \\"Consider\\" includes the insight, \\"Because of a fractured leg,/ God bestows a wing.\\"  \\"Boil Nicely Now\\" is a delightful yet powerful piece that draws a mystical lesson from a housewife's cooking of chickpeas.  In this poem particularly, Rumi skillfully carries out a metaphor to a truly stunning conclusion.<br /><br />This book shows Rumi to be a master of poetic language.  I was especially intrigued with his use of dialogue in certain poems.  Many poems deal with the state of being on a spiritual quest.  Indeed, Rumi seems to be pointing the way towards a deeper spirituality and humility that transcend religious legalism and conventionalism.  I recommend this book to spiritual seekers of any (or no) theological orientation, and also to anyone who loves poetry that can transcend time and culture as it speaks to us with an invigorating freshness.etic language.

121328:US	51987970	R1OAOC2N3QIA0P	0872861872	150285025	Roman Poems (City Lights Pocket Poets Series) (Italian Edition)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A passionate and politically charged voice from Italy	\\"Roman Poems,\\" by Pier Paolo Pasolini, is a bilingual edition with Italian and English versions of the poems on facing pages.  The translations are by Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Francesca Valente.  The book includes a preface by Alberto Moravia, who describes Pasolini as \\"a civil poet,\\" by which Moravia means \\"a poet who sees his native land in a way that the powerful of the country do not and cannot see it.\\"  There are a number of recurring themes and motifs in this book: the urban environment, poverty, politics, the life of a poet.  Many of the poems have a strong autobiographical or confessional flavor; a number of them deal with death.<br /><br />Another thing that struck me about these poems was that many of them evoke a gritty, down-and-dirty sense of life.  Pasolini's words evoke a world of \\"sweaty delivery boys,\\" \\"the sticky smell of coal,\\" \\"ancient whores,\\" and \\"alleys choked with darkness and garbage.\\"  Much of the book is very rooted in specific places; Pasolini cites such geographic names as the Viale Marconi, Trastevere Station, the fields of Aniene, Piazza Bologna, and the Garibaldi Bridge.  Pasolini creates a particularly powerful and mesmerizing portrait of the city.  He takes the reader from \\"the bourgeois quarter\\" to \\"a poor people's house at the city's far edge,\\" and vividly appeals to the senses as he describes what he encounters on the journey.<br /><br />Some of the poems that appealed to me the most are as follows.  \\"The Privilege of Thinking\\" offers the speaker's thoughts and observations while on a train ride; the poem is very down-to-earth, yet also has a transcendent quality.  \\"Sex, Consolation for Misery\\" is a darkly prophetic vision of a \\"new world\\" being born; the poem offers a paradoxical message and hallucinatory imagery.  \\"I Work All Day. . .\\" combines a playful touch with a political edge as the speaker reflects on his role as a poet.  \\"But It Was a Naked and Swarming Italy\\" offers a vivid and passionate portrait of a young poet living in poverty in Italy in the 1950s and 1960s.  But my favorite piece in the collection is \\"Toward  the Caracalla Baths,\\" which combines deliciously rich and evocative language with an effective parallel structure as the poet describes a diverse group of characters heading towards the title baths.<br /><br />The back cover of the book notes that Pasolini was born in 1922 in Bologna, and was murdered in 1975 near Rome.  I found this book very hard to get into on my first reading.  But as I re-read the poems, Pasolini's language and vision began to really come alive for me; he may be one of those poets whose work rewards patience and attentiveness.

Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of the Future, Volume XX,\\" edited by Algis Budrys, collects 15 tales from the Writers of the Future contest for 2003.  The collection is illustrated by winners of the Illustrators of the Future International Illustration Program.  Interspersed among the stories are essays on writing, art, and science fiction by L. Ron Hubbard, Robert A. Heinlein, Robert Silverberg, Vincent di Fate, and Kevin J. Anderson.  The stories fall into the genres of science fiction and fantasy.  The selections that impressed me the most are as follows.<br /><br />\\"Monkey See, Monkey Deduce,\\" by Jonathan Laden: a powerful story about an experiment in scientifically enhanced intelligence.  This story gripped me from its great opening line: \\"He screamed from all his mouths, then covered all his ears.\\"  \\"Bottomless,\\" by Luc Reid: follows a hero in his travels through a world that exists along the edges of a seemingly bottomless pit, lit by a \\"Sun Thread\\" suspended in the center of the pit and running its length.  It's a richly imagined world, with compellingly rendered geography and culture.  \\"In Memory,\\" by Eric James Stone: about a brilliant mathematician whose consciousness is duplicated and projected into a supercomputer.  This is a powerful, disturbing story that deals with memory, time, and family ties.<br /><br />Other standouts: \\"The Weapons of the Lord Are Not Carnal,\\" by Andrew Tisbert: follows a cyborg whose spiritual quest takes him to a friary on Mars.  \\"SunRunners,\\" by Matthew Champine: an exciting adventure that imagines Earth's moon as a sort of wild west frontier.  \\"Last Days of the Mahdi,\\" by Tom Pendergrass: Set in Egypt, this suspense tale involves genetically engineered spies.  It's a vividly written story that draws on Islamic culture and prophecy.  Among the essays, I particularly enjoyed Kevin J. Anderson's \\"False Summits,\\" which uses mountain climbing as a metaphor for a writing career.  Overall, I found this to be a fine anthology.  The collection as a whole features truly compelling themes and characters and takes the reader to some truly fantastic places.  I especially recommend this collection to those who love science fiction.collection as a whole features truly compelling themes and characters and takes the reader to some truly fantastic places.

Much of the novel revolves around Captain Yossarian, a bombardier in the squadron.  Heller has crafted an outrageous satire of the military.  He mercilessly mocks many aspects of the military: rank structure, chain of command, protocol, the military justice system, the chaplaincy, the military medical establishment, and more.  Heller's squadron and its higher headquarters form a world of cowardice, opportunism, and scheming; particularly biting is his portrait of jealousy, vanity, and self-serving ambition among the senior officers.<br /><br />The book is filled with many absurd images and zany situations, as well as with characters who have such names as Major Major, Colonel Korn, and Lieutenant Scheisskopf.  Heller's prose is a delight; the pages crackle and pop with clever wordplay and witty lines.  The book made me laugh out loud.  But the wacky comedy and merry prose style are wedded to a dark vision; the book is full of graphic violence and Kafkaesque nightmarishness.  There are also some vividly rendered scenes of aerial combat.  It's quite a remarkable blend.<br /><br />The story follows Yossarian and his comrades in combat, while being treated in the hospital, during down time on their base, and on their recreational excursions into war-torn Italy.  We see the relationships among the squadron members, as well as their dalliances with the women they meet during their tour.  And we also learn the meaning of Catch-22, a bureacratic clause that controls the destinies of these military men.  Yossarian is a compelling antihero, and \\"Catch-22\\" is a richly ironic work of satire.  The book has endured for decades, and is, in my judgment, more relevant than ever in the \\"global war on terror\\" era..	2005-08-02

Dickson, is a science fiction novel set in a future wherein humanity has spread out to inhabit many different planets in several star systems.  The different branches of humanity have evolved into a diverse group of different cultures.  One of these branches of humanity is the Dorsai, a formidable warrior race.  This novel follows the life and career of Donal Graeme, one of the Dorsai.<br /><br />The 1993 TOR edition includes an introduction by David Drake, who notes that \\"Dorsai!\\" and Robert Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers\\" were both first published in 1959, and together form \\"the standard against which the subgenre of military SF must be judged.\\"  \\"Dorsai!\\" is certainly an enjoyable and well-written space adventure.  Dickson effectively structures the story; we follow Donal as he rises up the military ranks from Senior Cadet to higher levels of responsibility.  Dickson fills the book with fascinating details about Donal's world.  It's particularly intriguing to get glimpses of the divergent human cultures and of the conflicts that exist among them.<br /><br />Along the way the book addresses many significant themes, such as military tactics, the role of religion in a military organization, and leadership.  At its best, \\"Dorsai!\\" goes beyond being just a solid adventure novel and can be genuinely moving and thought-provoking.  Recommended companion text: Joe Haldeman's \\"The Forever War,\\" another gem of military science fiction.	2005-07-24

Altogether the collection is over 500 pages long.  Some of the most striking selections in the book are as follows.<br /><br />\\"The Keys to December\\": A group of bioengineered intelligent beings seek to re-shape a planet in order to suit their unique needs, but the massive project has some unintended--and ethically challenging--consequences.  \\"Devil Car\\": In a future where cars have artificial intelligence, a human and his heavily armored vehicle embark on a mission to hunt down a killer rogue car.  \\"This Moment of the Storm\\" takes place in a human colony on the planet Tierra del Cygnus, a world of monstrous beasts and dangerous weather.  This story's main character is almost 600 years old, but has spent most of his life \\"sleeping\\" during long interstellar space voyages.  In the quirky \\"A Museum Piece,\\" an unappreciated artist decides to live in a museum, posing as a statue--thus becoming a living work of art.  \\"Divine Madness\\" is a stunning tale about a man suffering from a condition in which time seems to be moving backwards.  And the book's title story tells of a quest to catch a gigantic sea monster on the planet Venus.<br /><br />Zelazny has crafted some remarkable gems in this collection. These stories, while clearly in the great tradition of science fiction, often have the flavors of myth, fantasy, and folklore.  Zelazny's prose is truly a sumptuous banquet; his style is extremely literate and learned, with a crisp, clean elegance.  He weaves many cultural references into his writing; along the way he cites Dante, \\"Aida,\\" Dylan Thomas, Miniver Cheevy, the Iliad, Poe, Havelock Ellis, Vishnu, Rimbaud, and more.  Such references strike me as an integral and intriguing part of Zelazny's style.<br /><br />Zelazny succeeds in marrying strong science fiction concepts and settings to some really \\"down-to-earth\\" emotions and situations.  He creates well drawn characters, and is skilled at fashioning alternate worlds and cultures.  The stories touch on many powerful and resonant themes: love, loss, religion, crime, the passage of time, man's relationship to technology, the desire for a home, etc.  Lovers of serious literary science fiction should not miss this fine collection by a truly gifted prose stylist.tions and situations.

The back cover notes that infantryman Murphy \\"was the most decorated American soldier during World War II\\"; among the many decorations he received was the Medal of Honor.  The 2002 Owl Books edition features a brief foreword by Tom Brokaw, who declares, \\"In all of the research I've done on World War II combat veterans I cannot recall another story that involves so much up close and personal fighting.\\"<br /><br />The book's many vivid and detailed scenes of combat are impressive.  Murphy offers lots of information about military gear and tactics: camouflage, the mechanics of a river crossing, the way a mortar shell explodes, how one calls in artillery support, etc.  It's like a textbook of combat knowledge is blended into the text, making the book a compelling resource for military professionals.  The battle scenes are not romanticized or glamorized; rather, they are presented in a matter-of-fact, disciplined style that I found powerfully effective.<br /><br />Murphy details the many hardships and risks that WW2 infantry troops faced in the European campaign.  These ranged from the annoying to the deadly: fleas, water deprivation, malaria, trenchfoot, frostbite, sniper fire, landmines, separation from family, and combat-induced mental disorder.  Murphy is explicit in his portrayal of the horror of war.  He shows bodies ravaged by injuries, lives snuffed out, minds broken.  He does not spare the reader from \\"the smell of singed hair and burnt flesh.\\"  At times the book's grim tone and harsh representation of brutality has an almost antiwar flavor reminiscent of Dalton Trumbo's unforgettable novel \\"Johnny Got His Gun.\\"<br /><br />Murphy writes with respect and affection for the troops who shared the burden of war with him.  The book is full of soldier conversations, including playful insults and humor.  Murphy includes not only accounts of these troops in combat, but also anecdotes of soldiers during interludes of rest and play.  Another interesting aspect of the book is how it shows Murphy moving up the ranks and functioning as a leader in combat.  This is a powerful book that reads more like a novel than a memoir.

The back cover notes that Prevert's \\"Paroles\\" was first published in 1946; Ferlinghetti states that many of these poems \\"grew out of World War II and the Occupation in France.\\"<br /><br />I noticed some recurring themes and motifs in this volume.  Prevert is very concerned with human pain and suffering; also, there are many references and allusions to war.  There is a real iconoclastic streak running through this book.  Although many of the poems have a surreal, whimsical quality, much of this poetry is also firmly anchored in tangible realities: an orange, a raincoat, a cigarette, \\"the faint sound / of a hardboiled egg cracked on a tin counter.\\"  Some of the poems have an almost haiku-like quality, saying much with an economy of words.<br /><br />There were a number of poems that I found particularly striking.  \\"Song\\" had a joyful, transcendent quality.  \\"Inventory\\" had an experimental flavor that reminded me somewhat of Gertrude Stein's work.  \\"I've Seen Some of Them\\" is like a Whitmanesque litany, but with a darker, cryptic, and tragic tone.  \\"Picasso's Magic Lantern\\" uses words in odd and startling combinations; this poem eptomizes the role of the poet as a sort of prophet who evokes an altered state of consciousness through his creative process.  Prevert's voice in \\"Paroles,\\" although sometimes dark, is overall compassionate and even tender.  He seems to be intent on capturing the contradictions, absurdities, beauty, and despair of the early 20th century in his poetry.	2005-07-16

Twining, is a memoir by a U.S. Marine Corps officer who served on the headquarters staff of the First Marine Division during World War II.  The book is edited by Neil G. Carey and features a foreword by Lieut. Gen. Victor H. Krulak, USMC (retired).  Gen. Twining tells of the the Marines' stay in New Zealand in preparation for battle, the amphibious assault on the island of Guadalcanal, combat on the island, and the aftermath of his time on Guadalcanal.<br /><br />This is a fascinating account of the massive effort to transform this island into what Twining calls \\"an unsinkable aircraft carrier.\\"  He offers a comprehensive and compelling look at how all the various individuals and organizations contributed to this epic effort, among them Marine aviators, Navy Seabees, the Army Air Corps, Navajo code talkers, native workers, U.S. Coast Guard personnel, Army National Guard troops, and more.  He tells about American relations and encounters with British, Australian, and New Zealander personnel.<br /><br />Twining writes about the diseases, deprivation, and harsh conditions faced by the heroic personnel at Guadalcanal.  But it's not all grim and serious.  He offers colorful portraits of the people he served with and includes funny anecdotes--the book actually made me laugh out loud.  Gen. Twining skilfully weaves interesting technical details about military tactics and gear into the compelling human story. Whether writing about techniques used to cool machine guns in the heat of battle or the merits of different boat loading techniques in an amphibious assault, Twining always offers some fascinating insights into the practical realities of war.<br /><br />But what really makes this book remarkable, and even fun, is Twining's tone.  Yes, he is a serious military professional, with respect and affection for the many remarkable men with whom he served.  But his voice is also often quite feisty and cutting.  He doesn't hold back when criticizing many instances of military stupidity and short-sightedness.  At times his writing even has a blisteringly satiric edge.  \\"No Bended Knee\\" is a spirited and superbly written addition to the glorious canon of American military memoirs.n't hold back when criticizing many instances of military stupidity and short-sightedness.

Exum gets into detail about his military education and training.  He discusses his time in ROTC, and also takes the reader through the phases of Army Ranger school.  He also covers his stateside duty at Fort Drum, New York.<br /><br />The book shifts into a more intense mode when Exum recalls the infamous 9/11 attacks, after which his unit was mobilized for wartime duty.  He discusses his unit's activities in Kuwait.  After taking the reader in detail through his missions in Afghanistan, Exum describes his return to the U.S. after the war, and the changes that occurred in his life.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.  Exum's straightforward, down-to-earth writing style is nicely complemented by some thoughtful literary and cultural references throughout the book.  His accounts of military training and wartime service are interesting, especially his accounts of encounters with the press.  The book strikes me as a well-rounded account; he deals with the excitement and soldierly bonding of wartime, as well as its tedium and annoyances.  He creates warm and entertaining portraits of the soldiers he served with.  He presents a compelling view of Afghanistan: a \\"Wild West\\"-type environment of rugged natural beauty.  Exum also offers his musings about the relationship between war and spirituality.<br /><br />\\"This Man's Army\\" struck me as grimly ironic in light of ongoing operations in Iraq.  Exum notes how at one point he felt the Afghan campaign was \\"the greatest war ever,\\" \\"an adventure,\\" a \\"big game [. . .] against an overmatched opponent.\\"  Of course, Iraq has proven to be a much more difficult and deadly theater.  Overall, I found this book to be a thoughtful and informative look at contemporary training and warfighting in the U.S. Army.

Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer, collects 20 stories into a 500 page anthology.  The stories range in length from 6 to 71 pages.  Some of the highlights are as follows.<br /><br />\\"Amnesty,\\" by Octavia E. Butler: looks at relations between humans and a radically different intelligent species of communal life forms that have invaded Earth.  This story deals with issues of power, control, language, and communication; it is as penetrating and thought-provoking as Butler's other great works.  \\"Birth Days,\\" by Geoff Ryman: explores human reproduction, homosexuality, and biological research and experimentation.  \\"Ej-Es,\\" by Nancy Kress: a very moving story about a team investigating a seemingly failed human colony; the story addresses themes of disease, communication, cultural difference, and the human brain.  \\"Rogue Farm,\\" by Charles Stross: a funny tale about a farming couple defending their property against a mutant creature; this story is full of bizarre dialogue and images.  \\"In Fading Suns and Dying Moons,\\" by John Varley: an entomologist is enlisted to discover the meaning behind an invasion of the Earth by weird, butterfly-collecting aliens.  This story refers to and cleverly builds on the ideas in the science fiction classic \\"Flatland.\\"<br /><br />Also worthy of note--\\"The Day We Went Though the Transition,\\" by Ricard de la Casa and Pedro Jorge Romero: a time travel story with a Spanish setting.  This story also deals with terrorism.  \\"A Night on the Barbary Coast,\\" by Kage Baker: a colorful, highly entertaining tale about a pair of time-traveling cyborgs--who also happen to be father and daughter--on an adventure in 19th century San Francisco.  \\"The Madwoman of Shuttlefield,\\" by Allen M. Steele: a story of life in a human colony on a distant planet.  This is a full-bodied, richly evocative tale that covers many aspects of life in the colony--food, architecture, government, etc.  Steele creates memorable characters and powerfully drawn human relationships.<br /><br />But my favorite piece in the anthology is the brilliant \\"Coyote at the End of History,\\" by Michael Swanwick.  This cluster of five short fable-like tales, reminiscent of Native American animal trickster tales, tells about Coyote and his relations with the \\"Star People.\\"  Sort of like folk tales from a distant future, these Coyote tales are ironic, deliciously funny, and surprisingly poignant.  Overall, \\"Year's Best SF 9\\" is a wonderfully diverse and mind-expanding anthology.  This is the kind of book that reminds me why I fell in love with the science fiction genre in the first place.

The book has a copyright date of 1956.  The 1961 Signet paperback edition includes Dr. Dooley's 1961 obituary and a foreword by Admiral Arleigh Burke.<br /><br />In this book Dooley covers his service on board the U.S.S. _Montague_, his work at a refugee camp on the outskirts of the city of Haiphong, and his ties to a Vietnamese orphanage.  Overall it's a vivid, interesting narrative that includes many striking details.  Particularly fascinating are Dooley's details about the complex effort involved in building and sustaining the refugee camp.  He covers such practical issues as latrine facilities, and also addresses the challenge of overcoming cultural and linguistic barriers.  His insights still seem timely as U.S. forces engage in humanitarian and \\"nation building\\" operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Another strong section is his colorful description of the bazaar at Haiphong.<br /><br />The book does have problematic aspects.  At times his language seems forced and melodramatic.  Too often the text reads like overt anti-Communist propaganda, rather than a straightforward accounting of the facts.  Dooley tries too hard to tug at the readers' heartstrings.  Still, a real sense of his affection and respect for the Vietnamese people seems to shine through, and I found sections of the book, especially those dealing with the Vietnamese children, to be quite moving.<br /><br />I recommend that readers of this book also read the relevant sections of Randy Shilts' monumental work of military history, \\"Conduct Unbecoming.\\"  Shilts devotes three chapters to the tragic saga of Tom Dooley.  Particularly disturbing are Shilts' accusations that Dooley's accounts of Communist atrocities in \\"Deliver Us\\" were \\"unsubstantiated allegations,\\" \\"arguably fiction.\\"  Shilts also discusses the troubling and scandalous circumstances regarding Dooley's discharge from the Navy.<br /><br />The 1961 edition of \\"Deliver Us\\" is a compelling historical artifact; the front cover blurb declares that the late Dr. Dooley \\"became a living legend to the world.\\"  Also worthy of note are Admiral Burke's strong words of praise for the young doctor in the book's foreword.  Tom Dooley was a fascinating, larger-than-life character, and this flawed but fascinating memoir is, in my judgment, an important primary text of Cold War literature.ted allegations,\\" \\"arguably fiction.\\"  Shilts also discusses the troubling and scandalous circumstances regarding Dooley's discharge from the Navy.<br /><br />The 1961 edition of \\"Deliver Us\\" is a compelling historical artifact; the front cover blurb declares that the late Dr. Dooley \\"became a living legend to the world.\\"  Also worthy of note are Admiral Burke's strong words of praise for the young doctor in the book's foreword.

Through biblical citations, quotes from other authors, and his own words, Lucado exhorts the people of the United States to turn back to God--the Christian deity, to be specific.  The back cover notes that this is the \\"Official 2005 National Day of Prayer Theme Book.\\"<br /><br />It's an eye-catching presentation, with a blend of different typefaces, red and black ink, different font sizes, and photographs.  But the book left a bad taste in my mouth.  Lucado seems to be using the mantle of prophetic exhortation as an excuse for pushing a right-wing political agenda.  He seems intent on furthering an ugly and divisive culture war.  And in doing so in this book, he uses intellectually lazy and dishonest tactics.  In particular, he fills the book with invalid generalizations and unsupported accusations.<br /><br />Consider Lucado's inflammatory claim, \\"God's definition of the family has come under question. . . even ridicule.\\"  He doesn't back up the statement with any facts.  Who is ridiculing the family, and how? Or are these Lucado's code words for a political agenda?  Lucado also presents an odd perspective on prayer, making it sound almost like some sort of primitive magic.  His view on the Bible is also simplistic and ignorant of the wide range of biblical interpretation within the Christian world.<br /><br />Lucado shamelessly exploits fears of the Bible being banned from public schools and courtrooms, while ignoring the fact that Americans probably enjoy more religious freedom than any other people on the earth.  Indeed, Lucado seems to care little for the First Amendment.  Lucado's vision for the U.S. is focused only on conservative Christians, and ignores Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Native American religionists, neo-Pagans, and the other peoples of faith who make up the complex tapestry of American religious life.  Furthermore, Lucado depicts an unpleasantly selfish God.  Although Lucado may have had good intentions when he wrote this book, it comes across, to me at least, as angry, hateful, paranoid, and religiously chauvinistic.  This is the type of book that divides people in ugly ways.rthermore, Lucado depicts an unpleasantly selfish God.

This book collects four short novels in the genre of military fiction.  The first piece is \\"Cyberknights,\\" by Harold Coyle.  This tale looks into the work of a unit of U.S. Army computer specialists who wage war on the electronic frontier.  Although the Internet is their vehicle, their warfare has real world consequences.  Coyle creates an intriguing portrait of a unique military unit with its own jargon, protocols, and evolving culture; he raises potent issues of leadership and ethics in an Army facing profound technological and cultural change.<br /><br />The second short novel is \\"There Is No War in Melnica,\\" by Ralph Peters.  This tale follows the mission of a two-person U.S. Army team investigating wartime atrocities in the Balkans.  In straightforward but powerful prose, Peters creates a graphically violent and bloody tale.  It is a devastating look at how war and ethnic hatred warp and degrade human beings.  Through his characters Peters raises the incisive question: How should the Unted States respond to global acts of genocide?  It's a gripping, suspenseful, and even heartbreaking story.<br /><br />Third in the collection is \\"Cav,\\" by James Cobb.  This tale, set in the year 2021, follows the exploits of an Army unit in combat with hostile Algerian forces in Africa.  The story goes into detail about the unit's high-tech weaponry and vehicles, and also explores the personalities of the team.  The unit includes both men and women, and is diverse along both ethnic and religious lines.<br /><br />The fourth and final short novel is \\"Flight of _Endeavor_,\\" by R.J. Pineiro.  When the International Space Station is seized by a mutinous crew member with a deadly agenda, the space shuttle _Endeavor_ is sent with an emergency response team that has orders to retake the station.  The story's protagonist is a female former Marine aviator who now serves as an astronaut and shuttle commander.  This is an action packed, high-tech thriller that offers an interesting look at a woman in command.  Overall, \\"Combat 3\\" is a very entertaining and thought-provoking gathering of tales; it's an outstanding addition to the military fiction genre.n action packed, high-tech thriller that offers an interesting look at a woman in command.

Humphrey, a captain in the U.S. Army Reserve who was forced to resign her commission for being gay, explains the origin of this book in her preface.  The book is a collection of oral histories of lesbian and gay male veterans whose service spans from World War II to the final years of the Cold War era.  The veterans in this book are a diverse group: women and men; Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps; active duty, National Guard, and Reserve; officer and enlisted; and of various ethnic backgrounds.  They represent a wide range of military jobs: WW2 infantryman, Navy electronics officer, Army court reporter in Vietnam, combat medic, drill sergeant, pilot, recruiter, and more.  Besides Humphrey, a total of 42 veterans are featured; some use pseudonyms.<br /><br />Each featured veteran tells his or her story in the first person.  This is a fascinating collection of voices.  Some recurring themes include gay \\"networking\\" within the military and the impact of the AIDS crisis.  But I found the most striking recurring theme to be the surveillance, harrassment, intimidation, coercion, and even imprisonment of gay servicemembers.  Some of these stories are truly disturbing.  Many of the veterans talk about the devastating psychological consequences of such experiences.  On the other hand, a number of the vets talk about the positive aspects of their service.<br /><br />For those with some knowledge of the perennially controversial \\"gays-in-the-military\\" issue, some of the featured veterans may be familiar: Vernon \\"Copy\\" Berg, Leonard Matlovich, Joseph Steffan, Perry Watkins, etc.  There are some really noteworthy stories contained in this book.  Johnnie Phelps recalls an extraordinary encounter with General Eisenhower when she served as a WAC motor sergeant during WW2.  Air Force veteran Ruth Hughes recalls her experience as an African-American woman in uniform in the segregated South.  Miriam Ben-Shalom recalls a career that includes service in both the Israeli Army and the U.S. Army.  An equally remarkable career is that of J.W. \\"Skip\\" Godsey, a combat veteran of Vietnam who served in both the Navy and the Army.  One veteran known as \\"Janice\\" recalls her career as an Army nurse, which culminated in her retirement as a full colonel.<br /><br />This book is a fascinating and valuable contribution to American military history.  Some of the achievements of these men and women are truly remarkable.  Their voices are moving and thought-provoking.  With a 1990 copyright date, however, the book is clearly in need of a sequel.experience as an African-American woman in uniform in the segregated South.

The story is told in a series of letters from Kurt to his loved ones.  Through Kurt's letters, the reader follows him from his family home in Louisiana to training at Camp Lejeune and to the war zone in Vietnam.<br /><br />Kurt's Vietnam service includes time at both a hospital and with a front-line unit, as well as duty with a special unit designed to work with local Vietnamese militia and civilians.  These diverse experiences result in a rich and complex set of encounters with both U.S. military personnel and Vietnamese people.  The story offers a fascinating look at the various levels of the U.S. military presence in Vietnam.<br /><br />This is a big, bawdy, outrageous novel that reeks with the smells of sex and violence.  Kurt himself is a fascinating and very \\"politically incorrect\\" character.  He is certainly no noble poster boy for gays in the military.  On the contrary, he is lusty and sexually aggressive--just the type of amoral predator that inspires antigay fear.  He also has a nasty racist streak that comes out in the form of many foul slurs and slams.  Kurt's language is richly spiced with many cultural references, both \\"high\\" and \\"pop\\"--this, combined with his frequent Wildean comments, gives the book a remarkable flavor.<br /><br />Through his protagonist, Nelson delves into the psychology of both military homophobia and military homoeroticism.  It's an unflinching and sometimes graphic look at male-on-male sexuality in a wartime environment.  The sex in the book is at times a site of abuse, dishonesty, and conflict.  Nelson also rubs the reader's face mercilessly in the horror of war, with graphic accounts of nightmarish deaths and disfiguring injuries.  The book also gives often revolting details on such medical procedures as changing a colostomy bag.<br /><br />\\"Boy\\" attains a genuine epic sweep without losing an intimate human focus.  In its relentless satiric and comic vision, together with the outsider perspective of its protagonist, the book reminds me somewhat of Ralph Ellison's classic \\"Invisible Man.\\" Indeed, as a gay military man Kurt is a different sort of \\"invisible man.\\"  Furthermore, the level of detail in the book gives it a feel of authenticity comparable to that of some of the gripping Vietnam War memoirs I have read.

Phillips, is a gripping nonfiction tale of the Vietnam War.  The \\"about the author\\" section inside the book's back cover notes that Phillips served in the U.S. Marine Corps and is himself a Vietnam veteran.  Phillips' sources for this book include interviews with a number of the participants in the battle.  Retired general William C. Westmoreland contributed the book's foreword.  The book's poetic title is an allusion to one of the United States military's highest decorations for valor in combat.<br /><br />Lang Vei was a Green Beret outpost that was the object of a major attack in 1968.  Phillips strikes a very effective balance of technical details and human elements as he tells the story.  The book is full of intense combat scenes.  The straightforward, fact-driven style is well matched to the subject matter.  Intriguingly, Phillips notes where there are disagreements or ambiguities among his sources, thus reminding us of the difficulty in capturing history on the printed page.<br /><br />The book is full of revealing details about weapons, vehicles, and tactics.  Phillips looks carefully at the complex interlocking aspects of 20th century warfare, including human intelligence, air support, illumination, communications, first aid, and leadership.  He vividly captures the \\"Murphy's Law\\" aspect of combat, whereby weapons malfunction and other things go unexpectedly wrong.  Particularly fascinating is the human complexity of the battlespace in this account; the story involves not only U.S. military from different branches, but also Laotian and ethnic Vietnamese forces, as well as different tribal peoples of Vietnam.<br /><br />Phillips weaves the personal stories of a number of the battle participants into the overall story.  He also goes into detail about the long odyssey faced by the mother of a soldier who was declared MIA in the battle.  The text is further enhanced by several pages of photographs and other illustrations, as well as by a bibliography and index.  Written with intelligence and compassion, \\"Night of the Silver Stars\\" is a fitting tribute to the remarkable heroism shown by the warriors of Lang Vei.s and other illustrations, as well as by a bibliography and index.

Books	4	11	11	N	N	The comedian next door	\\"The Funny Thing Is. . .,\\" by Ellen DeGeneres, is a collection of short comic essays by the popular comedian and television star.  The humor in the book is largely grounded in the annoyances and absurdities of everyday life.  There are many moments when, as I chuckled at the joke, I also thought, \\"Yes!  She's so right!\\"  Whether mocking power bars, CD packaging, or self-flushing toilets, she effectively skewers these phenomena of the modern condition.  Along the way she also makes some gentle but humorous jabs at other celebrities.<br /><br />I found some of the most entertaining parts of the book to be about the book itself--how and why she wrote it, the process of picking a title, etc.  Some standout essays include her series of solutions to everyday problems (like zoning out in the middle of a conversation) and a delightful account of her meeting with God.  Along the way Ellen even reveals the secret behind the crop circle phenomenon.<br /><br />Ellen's humor in this book is good natured and mild mannered.  Even when she touches on the current hot political topic of same-sex marriage, she goes for some gentle absurdist humor rather than in-your-face sass.  Ellen's voice is like that of a funny next door neighbor who keeps you chuckling as you share a cup of coffee--or maybe a glass of scotch.  Although not every joke strikes the target, overall it's an enjoyable and entertaining book by one of show business's most likeable personalities.	2005-06-16

McCaffrey.  The book is Number 6 in the War and the Southwest Series.  Spanning the years 1845 to 1848, these letters tell of Laidley's journey through Mexico as an ordnance officer in the U.S. Army.  These letters combine with McCaffrey's illuminating commentary to tell a fascinating story.<br /><br />Laidley and McCaffrey cover many topics: concern about disease, battlefield medicine, the impact of guerilla activity on the U.S. campaign, the importance of mail to the troops, the challenge in getting volunteer troops to reenlist, cultural sensitivity issues involving U.S. troop contact with Mexican civilians, and conflict among senior U.S. military officers.  Laidley describes the reality of 19th century combat; he notes that \\"the horrors of war one can not understand until you have seen it.\\"  Particularly interesting are Laidley's observations on the Mexican land and people; he writes about climate, religion, architecture, agriculture, food, and language.<br /><br />One thing I found quite striking about the book was how relevant many of McCaffrey's and Laidley's topics are to the U.S. operations that are going on in Iraq and Afghanistan at the time I write this review.  Laidley's observations are full of interesting details.  His voice is at times quite feisty, and his style is consistently very readable.  Overall, this book offers a remarkable look at the U.S.-Mexican War.	2005-06-10

McGowan covers many parts of his life and career: his childhood in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of New York City, his youthful struggle to come to grips with his sexual identity, his service as an artillery officer, his duty in Germany at the end of the Cold War era, his combat tour in the first Gulf War against Iraq, duty at Fort Bragg, and his life after the army.<br /><br />Throughout the book McGowan charts his own search for love and sexual fulfillment in the shadow of the U.S. military's policy of discharging openly gay personnel.  Particularly noteworthy are his account of a relationship with another soldier, and his description of the military reaction to the start of the Clinton presidency.  McGowan vividly describes the impact the military's homosexuality policies have on gay soldiers; he shows how he was often forced to live a double life of lies and evasion.  He also recalls the hounding of other soldiers suspected of being gay.<br /><br />McGowan also reflects on Army tradition and esprit-de-corps, and gives insight into the experience of combat.  The book also touches on the same-sex marriage controversy; as the book jacket notes, he and his partner were married in a ceremony in New Paltz, New York in 2004.  The book contains some vivid and well-written sections.  Particularly moving is his account of his warm and loving relationship with the grandparents who raised him.  \\"Major Conflict\\" is a compelling story that effectively explores the timely gays-in-the-military issue.	2005-06-10

The book is a Billy Graham Library Selection.  It's 75 pages long, and divided into 15 short chapters.<br /><br />Laurie covers a number of topics: teamwork in evangelization, how to get people's attention, the importance of tact, the value of memorizing Scripture verses, sharing one's own testimony of faith, etc.  The chapters have titles such as \\"Patience and More Patience,\\" \\"The Cornerstones of the Gospel,\\" and \\"A Decision Deferred Is No Decision.\\"  Laurie enlivens the text with some personal stories about his own experiences.  Along the way he quotes Alexander McClaren and D.L. Moody.  Laurie's admiration for C.H. Spurgeon is evident, as he quotes him a number of times.<br /><br />Overall, it's a straightforward and easy-to-read book.  But it has its questionable points.  Particularly troubling are the passages in the book exploring why some people are resistant to evangelization.  For example, he raises some of the hard questions skeptics ask, such as \\"How can a God of love send people to hell?\\"  But I found Laurie's responses to be weak.<br /><br />Laurie also adopts a very judgmental and negative view towards those who don't accept his version of Christianity, saying that many \\"hide behind excuses\\" or \\"just don't want to change\\"; his simplistic analysis ignores the fact that there are millions of people who simply are honestly not convinced by Christian Fundamentalist rhetoric.  He also ignores the fact that there are millions of Jews, Buddhists, secular humanists, and adherents of other belief systems who are as committed to their faith as he is, and may in fact have gone through a challenging \\"change\\" to reach their current stage in their faith journeys.  Thus some of Laurie's counsel seems more prone to reinforce barriers than to foster meaningful dialogues.  Despite these weak points, however, I would recommend this book to Christian Fundamentalists who are interested in evangelism.s book to Christian Fundamentalists who are interested in evangelism.	2005-06-03

He served as an infantryman in the Vietnam War from January 1968 to January 1969.  TeCube fills this book with many details about the daily life of an infantryman in a war zone: being in a firefight, undertaking a combat air assault, walking point, etc.  He discusses the weapons they used.  The story is told in a straightforward style that is considerate of the general reader.  For example, the author stops to define or explain such military terms and acronyms as \\"MOS,\\" \\"tracer round,\\" and \\"concertina wire.\\"<br /><br />TeCube does not flinch from describing the horrors and loss of war.  But he balances out the narrative by discussing some of the humorous and friendly activities of the troops.  He discusses the encounters, both positive and negative, he and other troops had with Vietnamese civilians.  Along the way he offers many observations on the plants and animals he observed in Vietnam.<br /><br />An important theme of the book is how TeCube's Native American heritage and identity provided him with an anchor in this dangerous, challenging environment.  Particularly interesting are his accounts of how both other U.S. troops and Vietnamese people reacted to his Indian appearance.  TeCube discusses his ethnic identity and its impact on his combat tour in a matter-of-fact way.  Another important thread that winds through the book involves leadership and soldiering skill; we see TeCube move up the ranks as he gains experience in combat.  Overall, this is an interesting memoir that brings a valuable perspective to the rich canon of Vietnam War literature.	2005-06-03

Villarreal says this about the book: \\"This is a documentary of Hispanic boys from my home state of Arizona who served as pilots and aircrew in our armed forces during the war.\\"  The book contains entries on seventy-seven \\"flyboys\\" from both the Army and Naval air services.  The book is structured like a reference work; the seventy-seven entries are alphabetically organized and follow a standard format.  Each entry includes the man's name, rank, hometown, combat decorations, and other material.<br /><br />The flyboys include pilots, gunners, navigators, flight engineers, radio operators, and those in other jobs.  Both enlisted men and officers are included.  The book contains reproductions of many materials from the era covered.  There are photographs of newspaper articles from the _Phoenix Gazette_, _Tempe Daily News_, _Arizona Republic_, and other newspapers, as well as reproductions of such historic documents as a commendatory letter to a flyboy from the governor of Arizona.  Although some of these reproduced documents are difficult to read, overall they are a great feature.  The book is also full of photographs showing the flyboys and the crews they served with; many photos show the men together with the aircraft of their era.<br /><br />Villareal notes that his primary sources of information were wartime newspapers.  His footnotes give further insights into his research methods.  Included in the entries are some remarkable stories of courage and survival.  Quite a number of the flyboys survived time as POWs.  Villareal also tells of many of the men's lives after the war; there are some noteworthy accounts of achievement in both military and civilian careers.  It's clear that this book was a labor of love for the author.  This is both a valuable reference work and a moving tribute to this group of World War II veterans.	2005-06-01

In their introduction the co-editors note that this anthology contains \\"the most significant portions of the court record from a case known as _Joseph C. Steffan_ v. _Richard Cheney, Secretary of Defense_.\\"  They also note that Steffan was forced to resign from the United States Naval Academy after confirming that he was homosexual; the litigation began in 1988.<br /><br />Some of the documents included in this book are truly fascinating.  A memorandum in support of summary judgment for Steffan reproduces some outrageous quotes opposing racial integration and equality in the naval services in the 1940s.  Scholar John Boswell contributes an illuminating affidavit analyzing the history and use of the epithet \\"homo\\"; this piece is a response to the judge using this epithet in reference to Steffan.  Robert Rankin, a professor of psychiatry with 21 years of Navy service, offers testimony demonstrating \\"that gay men and women have served in the United States armed services throughout their history and in every armed conflict with distinction and in substantial numbers.\\"  Another interesting affidavit documents other nations' inclusive policies towards gays in the military.  Of particular importance is Judge Oliver Gasch's 1991 opinion.<br /><br />Along the way the contributors cite a number of relevant studies, as well as a number of similar cases: _ben-Shalom_, _Dronenburg_, _Watkins_, etc.  The pieces cover many issues pertaining either directly or indirectly to Steffan's case: the issue of homosexual orientation being \\"separate and distinct from homosexual conduct\\"; the use of \\"aversion shock treatment\\" in attempts to change sexual orientation; democracy and the concept of the \\"tyranny of the majority\\"; anti-gay violence; the relevance of sodomy laws; etc.  Some of the most interesting passages look at parallels between treatment of gays and treatment of other distinct groups; for example, a case debating whether the military can prohibit the wearing of yarmulkes is mentioned.<br /><br />This book incorporates a dense body of facts and citations.  At times the language may strike some readers as mind-numbingly technical.  But at its most striking the contributions touch deeply on the human issues at the core of this case.  _Steffan_ is certainly an important case, and this book is an extremely valuable window into it.

It contains the work of thirty-four poets, mainly ranging from the 18th to 20th centuries.  For the most part each poet is represented by a single short poem or excerpt, although some are represented by two or three pieces.  The poems are presented in bilingual format, with the German and English versions on facing pages; this makes the book especially useful for those who are learning, or brushing up on, German.  A note on the copyright page indicates that this book \\"is an unabridged and updated republication of the work originally published under the title _Invitation to German Poetry_\\" in 1959.<br /><br />This is a diverse and enjoyable collection which shows how, in the hands of a skilled craftsman, the German language can be an instrument of great power and amazing beauty.  The poems cover many topics and are varied in tone.  Some of the poets whose work is represented include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Rainer Maria Rilke, Hermann Hesse, and Bertolt Brecht.  For each poet there is a picture and a short biographical note; I found this supplemental material to be very informative.<br /><br />Some of my favorite pieces in this collection are as follows.  Heinrich Heine's \\"Ich wollte, meine Lieder\\" (\\"I Wish That All My Songs\\"): a delightfully witty and funny variation on the love poem.  Viktor von Scheffel's \\"Altassyrish\\" (\\"Old Assyrian\\"): a humorous story-poem about a drunkard in an ancient tavern; it has the delicious flavor of a drinking song.  Detlev von Liliencron's \\"Die Musik kommt\\" (\\"The Music's Coming\\"): uses wonderfully rich language to evoke the sights and sounds of a military marching band.  Christian Morgenstern's \\"Der Werwolf\\" (\\"The Werewolf\\"): a funny and clever satire of German grammar.  Erich Kastner's \\"Die Entwicklung der Menschheit\\" (\\"The Development of Mankind\\"): a witty satire of humankind, full of funny lines and written with a remarkable, scientific-sounding vocabulary.<br /><br />Also worthy of note is Franz Werfel's Whitmanesque \\"An den Leser\\" (\\"To the Reader\\"), with its sweeping embrace of humanity.  But my favorite of all is Stefan George's \\"Du schlank und rein wie eine flamme\\" (\\"You Slim and Pure Just Like a Flame\\"): a passionate, exquisitely constructed, and hauntingly beautiful love poem.

The book looks at many aspects of Leonard Matlovich's life: his background as the son of an Air Force sergeant; his combat duty in Vietnam, where he was severely wounded; his relationship with the Mormon church; his post-Vietnam Air Force duties as a drug and alcohol counselor and race relations instructor; his legal battle with the Air Force after he decided to challenge the policy on homosexuality; his life as a public figure after his case got media attention; his work as a businessman after leaving the Air Force; his political life as a conservative but pro-gay rights Republican; and his final years as an AIDS activist.  I found Hippler's look at Matlovich's relationship with his parents to be particularly moving.<br /><br />Matlovich is a well-balanced book; Hippler looks frankly at the choices Matlovich made.  The book covers Matlovich's failures and disappointments as well as his successes.  Throughout the book Hippler includes extensive quotes from Matlovich himself.  There are also many quotes from important people in Matlovich's life and times, among them lifelong friend Michael Bedwell, ACLU lawyer David Addlestone, journalist Randy Shilts, and Metropolitan Community Church founder Troy Perry.  This blend of voices is balanced quite well and complemented by Hippler's own narrative voice.<br /><br />The book also includes an epilogue that discusses subsequent court cases that challenged the ban on gays serving openly in the military; the specific cases are those of Navy petty officer Dennis Beller, Navy petty officer James Dronenburg, Army Reserve soldier Miriam ben-Shalom, and Army soldier Perry Watkins.  There is also a gallery of photographs showing Matlovich through the many chapters of his life.  This is a very informative and well-written book.  In the end Matlovich emerges as a true hero: a man of courage, conviction, compassion, and personal integrity.  And his words show him further to be a man who had hope and faith in humanity.  \\"Matlovich\\" is a fitting tribute to a remarkable man; it's essential reading for anyone interested in the ongoing \\"gays in the military\\" debate.n the end Matlovich emerges as a true hero: a man of courage, conviction, compassion, and personal integrity.

The book starts with Steffan's boyhood in rural Minnesota.  The author covers a number of topics as his story unfolds: the trials of \\"Plebe (i.e. freshman) Year,\\" his rise up the ranks to a key leadership position among the midshipmen, his coming to grips with his own sexual orientation, the harrowing discharge process, and his legal fight.<br /><br />Steffan creates a vivid portrait of life at the Naval Academy, a truly remarkable institution.  He looks at the traditions and language of the Academy, as well as at the process by which the Academy molds leaders.  Another important theme of the book is Steffan's overcoming of his own internalized homophobia; he goes through a process of reeducating himself on the topic of homosexuality.  The book also touches on events that were relevant to Steffan's situation: the \\"outing\\" of a high ranking Pentagon official, as well as the start of the Gulf War.<br /><br />This is a well-written and very interesting memoir.  Steffan's authorial voice is down-to-earth and reasonable.  There are some really memorable sections to the book, such as his account of a submarine training cruise.  A critical theme of the book is, as the title indicates, personal honor.  Steffan pays tribute to some of the other military personnel who have challenged the U. S. military's policy of excluding gay people: Leonard Matlovich, Perry Watkins, Margarethe Cammermeyer, and others.  \\"Honor Bound\\" is both a fine military memoir and an important \\"coming out\\" story.  As companion texts I recommend James Webb's \\"A Sense of Honor\\" (a powerful novel, set during the Vietnam War, about midshipman at the Naval Academy) and Margarethe Cammermeyer's \\"Serving in Silence\\" (another memoir of a gay person who challenged the military).on who challenged the military).	2005-05-25

He ultimately found healing and hope in Buddhism and became a monk.  This book recounts his spiritual, geographic, and emotional journeys.<br /><br />Thomas writes about his military basic training, his combat time in Vietnam, and the serious personal problems he had afterwards.  He writes how his life changed dramatically after he met Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk.  Thomas tells how he came to be ordained as a Buddhist monk.  He also writes of his global travels, of a remarkable walking pilgrimage he took across the United States, and of his relationship with his son.<br /><br />Along the way Thomas discusses teachings and practices that helped transform his life: meditation, the importance of community, the key concept of \\"mindfulness.\\"  He also discusses his commitment to nonviolence.  Thomas' writing style is simple and clear, and often quite eloquent and moving.  He notes, \\"Everyone has their Vietnam\\"--some source of great pain.  The book contains some fascinating scenes from the author's journeys; I found the vignettes from his walk across the U.S. to be particularly resonant.  This is a thought-provoking book, and a valuable addition to the canon of spiritual autobiographies.	2005-05-25

A note on the copyright page of this Shambhala Pocket Edition notes that this book is an abridged edition of \\"The Dalai Lama: In My Own Words,\\" first published in the UK.<br /><br />The excerpts are grouped together in several sections which are titled as follows: \\"Looking for Happiness in a Secular Society\\"; \\"The Real Troublemakers\\"; \\"Religion, Religions, and No Religion At All\\"; \\"Wanted: A Spiritual Revolution\\"; \\"Ethics and the Good Society\\"; \\"Democracy and Human Rights\\"; \\"Oneness: Taking Responsibility for the World\\"; \\"Tibet and Non-Violence\\"; \\"Forgiving the Enemy\\"; \\"Suffering, Impermanence, and Death\\"; \\"World Peace\\"; and finally, \\"Invitation to Action.\\"  Also included are an introduction by Craig, a postscript about the Dalai Lama's life and exile, and a bibliography.<br /><br />Many of the passages are followed by a note showing the source of that particular passage.  These sources are quite varied: a 1959 letter to U.N.

The Dalai Lama offers a truly global vision that embraces all of the world's people.  These passages indicate that he's not trying either to convert people to his faith or to create some new religion; rather, he invites practitioners of any religion (or of no religion) to focus on common values and engage in a meaningful dialogue.  Although he speaks with pride and love of his own Tibetan people and culture, he also celebrates the essential \\"oneness of humanity.\\"  He champions the dignity and worth of each human life, and looks to the potential for joy, love, and compassion in our interrelationships.

Marshall, is a nonfiction work about combat during the Korean War.  The title page bears the subtitle \\"The American Fighting Man in Action--Korea, Spring, 1953.\\"  The book's copyright page notes that a William Morrow edition was published in 1956.  In the preface, author Marshall recounts that he went to Korea in 1953 to work as a war correspondent, but at Army request he took on the job of investigating and analyzing infantry tactics.  He describes how he held question-and-answer sessions with groups of soldiers who had been in combat.  This interesting glimpse behind the making of the book adds to the text as a whole.<br /><br />Marshall describes many intense, horrific, bloody scenes of combat.  He vividly portrays the agonizing suffering endured by these combat troops.  He covers many significant topics, among them the following: Chinese military tactics; how U.S. and Korean troops worked together; communication on the battlefield; leadership and organization; the impact of terrain on battle; and types of weapons used.  I found one of the book's most interesting sections to be an account of the Ethiopian troops who fought in the war--Marshall praises these African soldiers greatly.<br /><br />The book features maps and drawings by H. Garver Miller.  Marshall includes a number of illuminating quotes from the fighting troops.  He vividly describes how confusing the battlefield can become--the phrase \\"the fog of war\\" came to my mind over and over again as I read this book.  Another phrase that this book brings to my mind is simply: \\"War is hell.\\"  This gripping, graphic work really makes me appreciate the remarkable challenge faced by troops in the Korean War, and the valor with which so many faced that challenge.	2005-04-27

The versatile De Veaux  creates a playfully poetic text that makes effective use of rhyme and alliteration.  At their liveliest her words really dance across the page.  I love her description of Sudan's hair: \\"It giggled when he talked/ and roared when he walked/ and often sprouted/ wings.\\"  The text is perfectly complemented by Hanna's illustrations.  Hanna combines a sweaty, down-to-earth quality with many surreal, fantastic flourishes.  Her illustrations are full of clever and delightful details.

Zuniga was a decorated veteran of the Persian Gulf War who had attained the rank of sergeant. The title alludes to a significant military honor bestowed upon him: being named Sixth U.S. Army Soldier of the Year in 1993.  This memoir covers his life from his birth in 1969 to the end of his military career in 1993.<br /><br />Zuniga's story is consistently interesting and compelling.  But I found the writing style often irritating and distracting.  The whole thing has a self-absorbed, adolescent flavor to it (understandable, perhaps, when one considers that the author was only 25 years old when the book was published).  The prose is at times sickeningly flowery, at times annoyingly bombastic.  He seems to be trying too hard to sound either learned or clever (such as when he calls a group of military personnel a \\"coven of courtesans\\").  Sometimes he just sounds bitter and childish (as when he mocks Senator Strom Thurmond's hair).  The stylistic flaws of the book are particularly regrettable because they detract from the many important issues he raises.<br /><br />Zuniga discusses his combat zone service as both a military journalist and a medic.  He also covers his stateside tours of duty.  He paints an often searing portrait of a gay soldier's closeted life.  One of the most fascinating sections of the book involves the question as to whether or not he improperly wore an Army award ribbon on his uniform during a public appearance; this material, including a fascinating appendix to the main text, gives readers a glimpse into the practical inner workings of the Army.  Also significant is Zuniga's account of his public activism and his own evolving relationship with the larger lesbian and gay community.<br /><br />Along the way, Zuniga cites a number of other American military personnel who have publicly challenged the ban against gay people serving openly.  He also cites Randy Shilts' monumental history of gays in the military, \\"Conduct Unbecoming.\\"  Despite the book's flaws, I consider it a valuable document in the significant body of works that deal with the controversial issue of gays in the military.

Info about the author on the book's dust cover states that Naylor is a senior writer for the \\"Army Times\\" and an experienced war correspondent.  Operation Anaconda was a campaign to destroy forces of the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Shahikot Valley in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Naylor tells a gripping story.  The book is full of fascinating technical details about the hardware used by U.S. and allied forces, including friendly Afghan forces: weapons systems, aircraft, ground vehicles, and communication systems.  We also gain insights into the military hardware used by Al Qaeda forces.  Naylor illuminates coalition tactics and command-and-control relationships.  He looks at the harsh Afghan weather and terrain, and their impact upon the operation.  But amidst all this information Naylor doesn't lose sight of war's critical human element; he creates striking portraits of military personnel and of units steeped in tradition.<br /><br />At the end of the book Naylor includes a list of the people he interviewed while researching the book.  The impressive list includes dozens of people, ranging from general officers and command sergeants major to lieutenants and privates.  I believe the wide range of people whose insights he sought are reflected in the quality of the book.  Interestingly, Naylor notes a number of times when his sources contradict each other.  It's a dense text that may overwhelm some readers with an avalanche of facts and names; fortunately, the author includes a helpful glossary and a \\"Cast of Characters.\\"<br /><br />At times the book is highly critical of the military leadership and planning process behind Anaconda.  But Naylor also celebrates the remarkable heroism and resilience shown by the troops on the battlefield.  There are some really stunning accounts of combat and perilous reconnaissance work.  Particularly fascinating is the book's exploration of helicopter warfare.  Naylor shows the complexity of integrating U.S. conventional and special forces, together with Afghan and coalition forces, into the overall operation.  This is a truly compelling addition to the growing canon of American war literature.  Recommended companion text: Evan Wright's \\"Generation Kill.\\"ance work.

Woulfe, is a fascinating nonfiction book that takes the reader into the Crucible, a component of U.S. Marine Corps training.  Woulfe describes the Crucible as \\"a fifty-four-hour endurance course in which recruits conquer challenge after challenge in increasingly demanding conditions [. . .].  It features little food and sleep, plus forty miles of hiking.\\"  Emphasizing teamwork and leadership, the Crucible features a series of obstacles named after heroic Marines, most of them Medal of Honor recipients.  In his brief foreword to the book Lt. Gen. Victor H. Krulak (USMC, ret.) describes the Crucible as \\"the classic culminating event of a rigorous revolution in the recruit's life.\\"<br /><br />Woulfe's narrative follows a group of recruits and their drill sergeant as the team works its way through the grueling rite of passage.  As the squad passes through the stations they learn about the extraordinary heroism of the Marines after whom the obstacles are named.  Woulfe describes the obstacles, which test both the recruits' physical abilities and problem solving skills, in intriguing detail.  Woulfe weaves into the narrative much information about Marine Corps history.  He writes about pioneering African-American Marines and the history of women in the Corps; he also covers Marine achievements in the Civil War, World War I, the Vietnam War, and other conflicts.<br /><br />The author skillfully weaves a portrait of the Corps that brings together its past (in the history recounted) and its future (in the recruits).  We learn about the backgrounds, personalities, and goals of the recruits.  Woulfe vividly portrays the physical toll that the Crucible takes on these aspiring Marines.  The book illuminates Marine esprit de corps, values, and heritage while revealing the complex process that transforms young men and women into Marines.  I found this book to be both informative and inspiring.  As an Army officer, I salute Woulfe for his work, and I salute the Marines whose stories he tells.r, I salute Woulfe for his work, and I salute the Marines whose stories he tells.	2005-04-20

The authors cover a number of intriguing facets of both the war and its background.  They analyze the U.S. \\"propaganda blitz\\" to improve the U.S.'s image in the Muslim world-a strategy they judge an \\"abject failure.\\"  They also look at some of the individuals and organizations that played roles in the leadup to war-among them Ahmed Chalabi and the Iraqi National Congress.<br /><br />Rampton and Stauber accuse the Bush administration of many distortions in its attempt to \\"sell\\" the war as if it were a product.  One of the book's most interesting sections is the authors' deconstruction of the Bush administration's wartime catchphrases: \\"axis of evil,\\" \\"coalition of the willing,\\" \\"shock and awe,\\" etc.  They critique not only the U.S. government, but also the Saudi regime.<br /><br />The book also looks critically at the media's role in the war.  The authors accuse the \\"right wing media echo chamber\\" of promoting a culture of fear and intimidation.  Among the figures whose work they question are Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, and Ollie North.  Particularly intriguing is the authors' look at differences in U.S. and Arab TV coverage of the war.<br /><br />I should note that I am an Army Reserve officer who has done a tour (2003) in Afghanistan and is currently serving in Iraq, and that I am firmly committed to carrying out my mission.  I was not bothered or offended by this book.  I believe that the authors are doing a service in challenging Americans to be more careful and critical consumers of information.  This book dares its readers to analyze and decode the messages that they receive from the government, the media, and the advertising industry; it also suggests that we need to know and learn from history.  I recommend this book to readers regardless of their political persuasion.	2005-04-20

The main character of this action-adventure novel is Mark Hardin, a Vietnam veteran known as \\"The Penetrator.\\"  The back cover describes Hardin as a \\"one-man strike force against corruption [. . .].  He is a warrior without uniform or rank, pledged to fight anyone-on either side of the law-who seeks to destroy the American way of life.\\"  The main action of the book is preceded by a prologue which offers further insights into the series' title character.  He is a \\"combat soldier,\\" a \\"highly skilled intelligence operative,\\" and a \\"seasoned assassin\\" who is skilled in Native American martial arts and medicine ritual.<br /><br />In this adventure the Penetrator investigates the deaths of 25 Mexican workers.  This leads him into the sinister world of those who illegally smuggle workers across the U.S.-Mexican border.  His investigation leads him further into a plot to create and sell a deadly new weapon-the \\"supergun\\" of the title.  As the Penetrator does what he does best, the reader is treated to chase scenes, fights, amorous encounters, and gory death scenes.<br /><br />Yes, the dialogue and narration are at times incredibly silly.  I laughed out loud several times while reading the book.  At times it seemed like a parody of an action-adventure novel.  But overall \\"Supergun\\" is enjoyable light reading, just the right length at 147 pages.  There are some genuinely exciting and entertaining passages, and at its best the prose style is remarkably effective.  The resourceful Hardin is a character similar in some ways to James Bond-he's a lover and a fighter, although unlike Bond he answers to no government.  Despite the Penetrator's brutality he's a surprisingly likeable character, and despite his formidable skills and arsenal he has a curiously down-to-earth quality.  An advertisement for other books in the series notes that the Penetrator is \\"deadly,\\" \\"unpredictable,\\" and \\"dedicated.\\"  If that's you're type of hero, I recommend this novel.If that's you're type of hero, I recommend this novel.	2005-04-20
282515:US	51987970	R3EOI8KZDQSAFW	1588261468	14623717	Don't Ask, Don't Tell: Debating the Gay Ban in the Military	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A dated but still worthwhile gathering of perspectives	\\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell: Debating the Gay Ban in the Military\\" is edited by Aaron Belkin and Geoffrey Bateman.  The book collects the proceedings from a conference, held in December 2000, entitled \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell: Is the Gay Ban Based on Military Necessity or Prejudice?\\"  In the book's preface it is noted that views opposing the inclusion of gays in the military are underrepresented because some invitees declined to participate, and also because one invitee who supported the ban changed his position before the conference.  The book focuses on the United States military.<br /><br />The text is broken down into eight primary sections: (1) an introduction, (2) a historical overview, (3) an inquiry into whether or not the ban preserves soldiers' privacy, (4) an inquiry into whether or not the ban helps unit cohesion, (5) a discussion of the experience of foreign militaries, (6) a look at the cost, both financial and human, of the ban, (7) a pair of talks by two openly gay servicemen, and finally (8) an inquiry into the future of the \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" policy.<br /><br />I found the book to be interesting and often thought-provoking.  The substantial historical overview (pp. 9-49) discusses important studies of this issue, as well as significant court cases (Matlovich, Berg, Ben-Shalom, Steffan, etc.) that have challenged the ban.  The discussion on foreign militaries features perspectives from New Zealand, Australia, the UK, and Israel.  At times the discussion is quite moving, such as when activist Dixon Osburn discusses the impact of the ban on gay military people.  Particularly fascinating are the personal stories of the two openly gay servicemen, U.S. Army officer Steve May and Royal Navy sailor Rob Nunn; both men show a human side to this controversy.<br /><br />Although this is a valuable text, I was struck by how dated it feels.  Because the conference predates the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are not addressed; both of these military campaigns are, in my opinion, critically relevant to the book's topic on multiple levels.  Also ironic is the fact that the British ban on gays serving openly had been lifted less than a year before this conference; as I write this review that policy change is now over five years old.  Still, the discussion is intriguing, and at their best the participants challenge assumptions and encourage genuine critical thinking on this very controversial issue.e military campaigns are, in my opinion, critically relevant to the book's topic on multiple levels.

A work of nonfiction, this book is written partly in the third person and partly in the first person with Zinni's voice speaking autobiographically.  \\"Battle Ready\\" covers the remarkable career of Zinni, who retired as a four-star general after a long career (1961-200) in the United States Marine Corps, and then continued to serve his country in the field of international diplomacy.<br /><br />The book covers Zinni's tour as an advisor to the South Vietnamese Marines during the Vietnam War, his eventful tour in Okinawa after Vietnam, his involvement in a humanitarian mission to help Kurdish refugees, his participation in an international humanitarian operation in Somalia, his tour as Commander in Chief of CENTCOM (the United States' military command in the Middle East) during continuing conflict with Iraq, and his diplomatic career after retirement from the Marines.<br /><br />Zinni shares his memories of world leaders and military people such as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, Somali leader Mohammed Farrah Aideed, and more.  He recalls the many historic events that impacted his life and career: the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Gulf War, the battle of Mogadishu, etc.<br /><br />This is a big, exciting book about a truly epic life.  Zinni's down-to-earth voice makes the history covered by this book come to life.  He comes across as a proud warrior who is passionate about being a peacemaker.  The book is full of memorable passages, such as his account of a remarkable visit to East Berlin shortly after the fall of the Iron Curtain.  And he raises many important issues, such as the challenges of managing a multinational force and working with nongovernmental organizations.  Ultimately, Zinni articulates a vision of the military as \\"a calling and not just a job.\\"  I found this book both fascinating and inspiring, and I particularly recommend it to all military professionals.rofessionals.	2005-04-10

Zaid, and includes an introduction by Doris L. Bergen.  The book brings together not just his letters, but also other documents that illuminate the wartime career of Rabbi Eichhorn, who served as a chaplain in the U.S. Army.  His service included time in the European combat zone.<br /><br />Other texts interspersed among the rabbi's letters are excerpts from his 1969 unpublished autobiography, as well as letters he received from family, friends, and colleagues.  Altogether these texts create a vivid portrait of his travels and service.  Also included in the book are photos that span the rabbi's entire life, including his wartime service; a glossary of Yiddish and Hebrew words and phrases he uses in his letters; an index; and an epilogue by coeditor Zaid, who is also the rabbi's grandson.<br /><br />The letters and other texts cover the rabbi's travels in France and Germany, his encounters with important military leaders, and the living conditions he experienced in wartime.  The book is full of interesting details about his duties as a chaplain.  He discusses the horrors and inhumanity of war, as well as examples of kindness and courage that seemed to restore his faith in humanity.  The personal touches on his letters to his wife and children are charming and sometimes humorous.<br /><br />This is a marvelous book and a fine tribute to a man who, in his own words, strove \\"to be a good soldier and a good rabbi\\" during one of the most critical periods in American and Jewish history.  Inspiring and educational, \\"The GI's Rabbi\\" is an outstanding contribution to both U.S. military history and Jewish studies.  I strongly recommend this book for both academic and general audiences.	2005-04-08

Griffith II.  Griffith also provides a substantial introduction to the text.  The book is written in the context of China's guerrilla war against Japanese occupiers; this conflict is mentioned often by Mao.  In this book Mao discusses the differences between guerrilla and \\"orthodox\\" military forces, as well as how such forces can work together for a common goal.  Other topics covered include propaganda and political concerns, the formation of guerrilla units, the qualities of a good guerrilla officer, discipline in a guerrilla army, and guerrilla bases.<br /><br />Mao stresses the importance of speed, surprise, and initiative in guerrilla war.  Among the most interesting sections of the book is a code of conduct for guerrilla fighters.  Most of the book is fairly dry and matter-of-fact, but there are welcome flashes of passion, poetic imagery, and global vision that make this more than just a textbook.  Translator Griffith notes that Mao's text was first published in 1937.  Despite the passage of time, I believe that this is still a relevant text, and I recommend it in particular to all professional military personnel.	2005-04-08

The book's title comes from the nickname earned by the unit.  The copyright page notes that the text was originally published in 1899.  TR tells about the recruitment and training of the Rough Riders, their voyage to Cuba, their battles, and their return home.<br /><br />Much of the book concerns what, in TR's opinion, makes for good soldiers and good leaders.  Although the book first appeared over a century ago, I found many of TR's observations startlingly relevant to contemporary warfare; he discusses wartime refugees, guerrilla warfare, wartime atrocities, and battlefield news correspondents.  Other topics covered include illness among the troops and the impact of weather and terrain on warfare.  He also discusses occasional humorous material, such as the nicknames some soldiers earned.<br /><br />Roosevelt includes fascinating technical details about the weapons of this era.  Although he frankly discusses the violence, wounds, and deaths of the battlefield, overall I got a sense that TR saw the war as a grand adventure-even fun on a certain level.  The writing style is very engaging and has a clear, matter-of-fact quality.  TR's admiration and love for his troops ultimately gives the book a real warmth and humanity.  This is truly a landmark in the rich canon of American military memoirs.	2005-04-02

The 2003 Eos-HarperCollins edition includes an Author's Note in which Haldeman declares this to be \\"the definitive version\\" of the novel, and discusses its serialization and previous editions.  He also notes that in a sense the book is about the Vietnam War.  The copyright page notes that the book was originally published in 1974.<br /><br />The story begins in 1997.  William Mandella, an earthman born in 1975, is drafted to fight in humanity's interstellar war against a mysterious species known as the Taurans.  He undergoes intense training and begins his career as a combat soldier.  But the time distortion caused by interstellar travel has a profound effect on the soldiers in this war.  While Mandella seems to be living out a normal human lifespan, the earth he leaves behind ultimately ages (relativistically speaking) at a much more rapid rate.<br /><br />Mandella tells his story in the first person.  He's an appealing, tell-it-like-it-is hero. The book is full of fascinating technical details about futuristic interstellar war, particularly regarding tactics and hardware.  The training and combat scenes are well-written.  But in the end it's a very down-to-earth, human story.  Haldeman offers an intriguingly satirical view of war, the military, and societal change.  Particularly interesting is Mandella's progress coping with the evolution of human sexuality over the centuries.<br /><br />A blurb about the author identifies Haldeman as a Vietnam vet and adjunct professor at MIT.  I greatly enjoyed this novel; in the end I found it to be uplifting and life-affirming.  As a work of art, it may be even more relevant now as U.S. troops continue the missions in Afghanistan and Iraq.  And I believe that this book will continue to remain relevant decades from today.	2005-04-01

An openly gay woman, she challenged the U.S. military's policy of discharging gay people.  But her fight over this policy is only part of a wide-ranging and consistently fascinating book.<br /><br />The book begins with her childhood in Norway during World War II and Nazi occupation.  The reader follows her as she emigrates to the U.S. and becomes a citizen.  Cammermeyer tells in depth about her career as an Army nurse; particularly fascinating are her memories of serving in wartime Vietnam.  The book also covers marriage, motherhood, and divorce, as well as her civilian nursing career and her continuing military service in both the Army Reserve and the National Guard.<br /><br />A particularly intriguing aspect of the book is her quest to raise a bilingual family and celebrate her Norwegian roots; in this regard the book represents a fine contribution to the canon of multiethnic American literature.  The book is not just about the colonel, but is a multigenerational family story; her accounts of her relationships with her parents, sons, and other relatives are very moving.  Cammermeyer also offers interesting insights into military life, the nursing profession, and the process of discovering the lesbian and gay community.<br /><br />Cammermeyer has lived a truly epic life, and this book is absorbing throughout.  I found the prose style very enjoyable to read.  The book's cover emphasizes the colonel's role as a pioneer for gay rights, and indeed this aspect of the text is truly compelling.  But the book succeeds on many other levels.  I highly recommend \\"Serving\\" to those interested in the Vietnam War, lesbian and gay studies, military memoirs, women's studies, and the nursing profession.	2005-04-01

The author draws from a rich variety of sources in order to tell this story.  Among the topics he covers are the following: the process of being inducted into the armed forces in that era, the experiences of gay people in the training phase, gay social life stateside (particularly in the major port cities), the threat of harassment by military police, the role of military psychiatrists in our culture's evolving understanding of homosexuality, and the experiences of gay soldiers in combat.<br /><br />Berube also reveals the tensions that occurred within the military establishment as efforts were made to refine and reform policies dealing with homosexuality.  He discusses the interrogation and imprisonment of gay troops.  Other interesting topics covered are gay slang and coded language, and the use of female impersonators in GI shows like \\"This Is the Army.\\"<br /><br />The book includes a number of black-and-white photographs and reproductions.  There is also a note on sources used, such as interviews, letters, and government documents.  There are also extensive endnotes.  Throughout the book, Berube brings forth the voices of many WW2 veterans.  Ultimately he looks at the impact of WW2 on the evolution of gay culture and political activism.  I consider this book to be an essential companion to Randy Shilts' monumental \\"Conduct Unbecoming: Gays & Lesbians in the U.S. Military,\\" which focuses on the post-WW2 era.  \\"Coming Out Under Fire\\" is a remarkable achievement: poignant and inspiring, it is a valuable addition to the fields of both lesbian and gay studies and military history.	2005-03-29

The book includes, as Terry notes in his introduction, \\"Enlisted men, noncommissioned officers, and commissioned officers.  Soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.\\"  Also included are men who served time as prisoners-of-war.  Altogether the time spent by these men in Vietnam spans from 1963 to 1973.<br /><br />This is a diverse and compelling collection of personal stories.  The men in the book held a wide variety of military jobs in Vietnam, among them rifleman, combat engineer, medic, interpreter, combat photographer, electronic warfare officer, armorer, combat paratrooper, and more.  The veterans discuss many topics: racism, interracial friendship and bonding, receiving and recovering from wounds, wartime atrocities, and post-Vietnam life.<br /><br />It's hard to pick out a few representative stories from this rich and rewarding collection, but I'll try.  One man describes his work as an activist for incarcerated veterans after the war; another discusses becoming a champion amputee athlete after being disabled in Vietnam; another fondly remembers one of the war's military working dogs.  Fred Cherry's graphic account of his suffering as a POW is devastating.  Dwyte Brown's memories of the inland R&R spot-a \\"paradise\\"-make for an ironic and enjoyable contrast to some of the grimmer entries.  And Sergeant Major Edgar Huff's chapter recalls not just Vietnam, but a Marine Corps career that spanned three decades.<br /><br />Terry's text masterfully captures vernacular speech.  I could really imagine these veterans speaking the words.  The book also includes black-and-white photographs; a glossary of military terms, acronyms, and slang; and a chronology of the Vietnam War.  Moving and powerful, \\"Bloods\\" is, in my opinion, an important contribution to the fields of African-American studies and military history.	2005-03-29

The book includes production information on both plays.  \\"Streamers\\" was produced and staged in 1976, and \\"The Orphan\\" was first produced professionally in 1973.<br /><br />\\"Streamers\\" looks at a group of Army soldiers who are facing the possibility of being sent to Vietnam while the war is going on.  Rabe focuses on a group of three roommates, all junior soldiers.  As these troops talk and argue together with the other soldiers in the play, Rabe shows how tensions within the military can create fracture lines along many axes of difference: race, sexual orientation, educational background, rank.  Early on in the play Rabe introduces the theme of homosexuality in the army; this theme plays a significant role as the story unfolds.  Also explored is the relationship between younger troops and experienced combat veterans.<br /><br />\\"Streamers\\" is a play that may seem a deceptively straightforward slice of military life, but I found it to be a dense and complex text, rich in irony, that rewards careful reading.  It's a powerful play that effectively presents a group of military personnel as a microcosmic world of tension, lust, anxiety, anger, and violence.  Particularly piercing is Rabe's look at the intersection of verbal \\"violence\\" and physical violence.<br /><br />I found \\"The Orphan\\" far less interesting than its companion piece.  In it Rabe melds ancient Greek lore with late-20th century American concerns.  Although the play has some strong moments, overall I felt it lacked effectiveness.  I felt that Rabe missed a golden opportunity to really use the Trojan and Vietnam wars to shed light on each other.  Nevertheless, the presence of \\"Streamers\\" in this volume makes the book well worth owning, especially for those with an interest in the literature of war.

He declares in his introduction, \\"I wrote this book not to dissuade us from war but to understand it.\\"  Hedges, a reporter, also notes in his intro that he has covered insurgencies and wars all over the world.  In the acknowledgments section he also notes that he graduated from Harvard Divinity School.<br /><br />Hedges writes that war \\"forms its own culture,\\" that it is \\"a drug\\"--\\"an enticing elixir.\\"  I found the book to be full of truth and keen observation, especially when Hedges explores how war distorts language and culture.  Still, at times I found Hedges' words to be excessively grim and dogmatic, such as when he writes that \\"necrophilia is central to soldiering.\\"  I am a soldier who has served in Afghanistan and Iraq, and I have seen military people make committed efforts to respect and protect civilian lives--hardly a necrophiliac attitude.<br /><br />In his quest for understanding, Hedges takes the reader all over the world: to Sarajevo in 1995, to divided Cyprus, to a Gaza Strip refugee camp, to Kurdish Iraq after the Gulf War, etc.  His analyses are fascinating; I was especially intrigued by his exploration of Argentine life during the Falklands war.  Also noteworthy is Hedges' bitter, biting critique of the atmosphere surrounding the Persian Gulf War.<br /><br />As he tries to understand and explain war, Hedges draws on many cultural and literary sources: the \\"Iliad,\\" George Orwell's \\"1984,\\" as well as the writings of Primo Levi, Marguerite Duras, Sigmund Freud, and others.  Especially important to Hedges is William Shakespeare, many of whose plays are cited throughout the book.  Hedges' language is straightforward but powerful--his words burn with a righteous outrage.  This book is a passionate and prophetic testament for our time, and as a veteran, I'm glad I had the chance to read it.	2005-03-22

Coers' intro is followed by a comprehensive bibliography, making this edition a treasure for Steinbeck scholars.<br /><br />The text of the novel itself is quite short (112 pages in the Penguin edition).  \\"Moon\\" tells the story of a town that is invaded and subdued by an army from another country--little hints indicate that the invader is WW2-era Germany.  Steinbeck reveals the psychodrama of relations among occupying troops, the town's civil authorities, and the civilian population.  The story explores the tension within the ranks of the occupiers as well as the people's reaction to occupation.<br /><br />This is an intriguing novel.  Steinbeck's prose at times gives the book an almost fable-like flavor.  His characters seem at times more like archetypes than fully fleshed people.  At his most powerful Steinbeck endows the book with some really haunting imagery.  After more than six decades, this book remains, in my opinion, compelling and relevant.	2005-03-05

Books	4	1	1	N	N	An entertaining tale of naval aviators	\\"Check Six!\\", the novel by Bob Norris, takes the reader into the world of a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier.  A note about the author inside the back cover states that Norris is a commander in the U.S. Navy and a veteran combat pilot.  This story is told from the perspective of Jack Warner, \\"a journalist specializing in military affairs\\" who has reported on the notorious Tailhook scandal and its aftermath.<br /><br />Warner lands a choice assignment: he is to cover the integration of two female pilots into a Hornet fighter squadron on board the U.S.S. _Ranger_.  But early in the novel Jack is tipped off that the women may face a sexist conspiracy to keep them from achieving their mission.<br /><br />\\"Check Six!\\" is an exciting, swiftly moving narrative that is really enjoyable to read.  Yes, some characters and situations struck me as a bit corny or contrived, but overall it's an effective tale.  Norris has taken the topics of women in the military and the relationship between the press and the military and integrated them into a solid action/suspense story.<br /><br />Norris also offers the reader a colorful and well-detailed taste of life on board a naval vessel.  Although I never served on a carrier, in my own naval career I spent some quality time on board a frigate at sea, and I can testify that at key points Norris' writing has an authentic salty sea taste.	2005-03-05

The revised and updated paperback edition is truly a monumental work at over 800 pages.  The bulk of the text deals with the years from 1954 to 1990; there is also a short prologue covering 1778 to 1954 and an epilogue dealing with the early 1990s.<br /><br />In the opening \\"Author's Note,\\" Shilts writes that he interviewed 1,100 people for the book; this included \\"military personnel, their families, and their lawyers\\" as well as others.  He also notes that in his research he \\"accumulated nearly 15,000 pages in previously unreleased documents.\\"  The nitty gritty work shows in this richly detailed book, and is well documented in the endnotes.<br /><br />From the raw material Shilts has fashioned a truly epic narrative.  At times it reads like a novel with many characters whose stories are woven into one overarching story.  The tale spans the globe and many decades.  Along the way Shilts introduces many remarkable people, among them Air Force sergeant Leonard Matlovich, Army sergeant Perry Watkins, Navy midshipman Joseph Steffan, and many more.<br /><br />Shilts recounts many horrific stories of surveillance, harassment, intimidation, imprisonment, and suicide.  The stories are often dystopian nightmares that seem more like tales out of Nazi Germany or the USSR.  But there are also accounts of personal courage and triumph which counterbalance the harsher material.  Particularly fascinating is Shilts' account of the persistent gay/lesbian subculture in the military, particularly aboard naval vessels.  The details of Shilts' stories are illuminating and memorable, and sometimes humorous.<br /><br />Despite the book's large size, I found it to be a swift read.  Shilt's style is clear, to-the-point, and a pleasure to read.  Often I found the book hard to put down--a tribute to Shilts' skill as both researcher and prose stylist.  With America's military personnel carrying out missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere in the post-9/11 world, Shilts' book takes on, in my opinion, a renewed relevance.ist.

Pfarrer also notes that the acronym \\"SEAL\\" stands for the elements in which he and his sailors were trained to operate: sea, air, and land.<br /><br />Pfarrer's story has a truly global scope, moving from the States to Lebanon, Europe, and Central America.  He vividly describes the rigors of SEAL training and the high-adrenaline missions he took on afterwards.  Along the way are some colorful portraits of SEALs he knew, including those who mentored him.  Particularly powerful is Pfarrer's account of his tour in Lebanon in 1983, during which a devastating attack was unleashed on U.S. forces.<br /><br />Pfarrer writes about the particular mystique and distinctive qualities of the SEAL community.  He discusses SEAL encounters and collaborations with foreign military forces all over the world.  Also intriguing are his descriptions of SEAL relationships with other communities within the U.S. military--Marines, surface warfare sailors, Army paratrooper instructors, etc.  He also doesn't shy away from discussing problems within the SEAL world or the toll this demanding life can have on people.<br /><br />At over 400 pages, this is a substantial text.  But despite its length, it's a lean and polished work.  Pfarrer fills the book with just the right amount of technical and tactical details--enough to complement the human story without overwhelming it.  His prose is vigorous, flavorful, and solid, with an occasional satiric edge which I found most refreshing.  \\"Warrior Soul\\" is truly an outstanding American military memoir.	2005-03-04

A sex scandal led to her 1997 resignation from the Air Force; she presents her side of the story in this book.  While the story she tells is interesting, her approach to the material is quite troubling.<br /><br />The book has a sleazy, self-serving tone.  She constantly complains about the Air Force and tries to present herself as a victim, even while candidly admitting her violations of military rules governing sexual conduct.  Typical quotes from the book are as follows: \\"I was a prime target for a predator\\" (p. 159); \\"I've [...] been singled out for shame in the media spotlight because I am a woman\\" (239).  Of her married lover she writes, \\"But I just couldn't get him out of my mind\\" (168).  Her constant whining becomes tiresome quickly.<br /><br />Flinn seems to relish making allegations about perverse and scandalous sex within the Air Force community.  On the Air Force social scene in Minot, North Dakota she claims, \\"Everybody was sleeping with everybody\\" (148).  She seems to imply that her adultery should be excused because of the alleged piggish behavior of others in Air Force circles.<br /><br />Ultimately, Flinn's argument falls apart because she seems to want to have it both ways: it appears she wants the reader to see her as both a strong, capable warrior and as a pitiable, abused victim.  The overall gossipy and narcissistic feel of the book is quite distasteful.  Still, it's an intriguing narrative, and despite the book's flaws Flinn's story raises some serious issues that are worth pondering.	2005-02-11

A pre-title page review excerpt notes that this book is \\"a greatly expanded version\\" of a three-part series that the author contributed to \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine.  Wright's narrative follows the adventures of the First Reconnaissance Battalion of the United States Marine Corps as they make war across Iraq.<br /><br />I found it hard to put down this gripping book.  Wright is a superb writer who really brings these Marines to life; they emerge as complex, fully-realized individuals.  Wright vividly renders the Marines' dialogue; they argue and insult one another but also express words of tenderness and admiration.  The dialogue is often profane, sexual, and charged with ethnic comments, and is peppered with a smorgasbord of pop culture references.  Wright reveals how the Marines struggle with moral and ethical issues, challenge their own leaders, agonize over civilian casualties, and worry about losing their own humanity in the brutal nightmare of war.<br /><br />The book is full of graphic depictions of violence, destruction, gore, and human suffering.  But there are also a lot of absurd and funny interludes.  An important recurring theme is the ambiguity and controversy surrounding ROE (Rules of Engagement, which provide guidelines as to whether or not a military person can use deadly force).<br /><br />This book struck me as being balanced and fair; I think it would be hard to accuse Wright of any political agenda.  He's also not afraid to relate events that make himself look foolish.  As a storyteller he is humane and attentive, and fills the book with fascinating details about life in an active combat zone.  This book belongs on the shelf with all the great classics of war literature.	2005-02-11

Lyons Wakeman, 153d Regiment, New York State Volunteers, 1862-1864\\" is edited by Lauren Cook Burgess and contains a foreword by James M. McPherson.  The book collects the letters of a young woman who disguised herself as a man in order to enlist in the Union army during the United States Civil War.<br /><br />In her letters Sarah discusses the draft, army training, pay, troops' living conditions, and her relationship with her family.  Along the way she reveals interesting facts about army life.  But her letters do more than just convey facts.  We also learn of her religious faith, her pride as a soldier, and her hopes for the future.  Her letters reveal a courageous, determined, and feisty personality.<br /><br />The book is full of illuminating features.  There are many period photos that help bring Sarah and her world to life.  There are even photos of her handwritten letters and of army records that document her military career.  Also included in the book are maps of relevant military sites, a history of her army unit, her family genealogy, a comprehensive bibliography, and an index.<br /><br />The book's introduction, which notes that hundreds of women masqueraded as men in order to fight in the Civil War, helps put these letters in perspective.  Also fascinating is McPherson's foreword, which relates the ironic story of editor Burgess' experience as a \\"Civil War reenactor.\\"  I was deeply moved by this book.  It's a poignant and inspiring human document.  In the end I came away with a great feeling of admiration for this remarkable soldier.  As a veteran of another century's war, I salute Private Wakeman and thank Burgess for her outstanding work.  Recommended companion text: the novel \\"Girl in Blue,\\" by Ann Rinaldi.	2005-02-10

Mackin, has an introduction and annotations by George B. Clark and a foreword by Lieutenant General Victor H. Krulak, USMC (Ret.).  Clark's introduction notes that Mackin was born in New York State in 1898 and enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1917.  This book evokes the combat experiences of Marines in Europe during WW1.<br /><br />I found this book quite stunning.  The sections often read like prose poems or very short stories.  Mackin is graphic in describing wartime violence and suffering, but his writing is also at times quite beautiful.  The narrative opens with the Marines preparing to advance upon German-held Belleau Wood.  Mackin follows in particular the career of \\"Slim,\\" a Marine who becomes a runner (battlefield messenger).<br /><br />Mackin covers a number of subjects: encounters with German troops, relations with civilians, relations between \\"old-timers\\" and green replacement troops, and the dangers of the runners' job.  The book contains many interesting technical details about war in that era: weapons, fortifications, poison gas, etc.<br /><br />The narrator's voice is often ironic, satiric, sarcastic, and even bitter.  But his voice is also humane--he sees moments of kindness and tenderness in the midst of the hell of war.  At one point the author cites Walt Whitman.  Like Whitman, Mackin is irreverent yet compassionate, with an eye for detail and a knack for rendering humanity in both its tragedy and beauty.  This is a valuable addition to the canon of United States war literature.	2005-02-03

Webb looks at the fiercely regimented life of the school's midshipman, who prepare to become Navy and Marine Corps officers as the Vietnam War rages on.  The book jacket notes that Webb is himself a graduate of the Naval Academy and a highly decorated Marine.<br /><br />The main characters in the novel include the following. Bill Fogarty is a first class (senior) midshipman; he is a tough, disciplined man who boxes and aspires to be a Marine Corps officer.  John Dean is a fourth class (freshman) midshipman; he's academically brilliant, but also a whiny misfit who enrages the upperclassmen.  Ted Lenahan is a Marine Corps captain, a combat veteran of Vietnam whose job is to mentor midshipman.<br /><br />These and other characters are among the elements that make this a gripping novel.  Webb has crafted a vivid and revealing portrait of Annapolis life--the rituals and slang, as well as relationships among midshipmen, academic faculty, and officer mentors.  Through his characters Webb asks piercing questions about leadership and character.  Particularly interesting is his presentation of a contrast between \\"technocrats\\" and \\"warriors\\" in the officer corps.<br /><br />Webb captures the pain, loneliness, frustration, pride, and triumph of military life.  He evokes a sense of the midshipman forming a \\"tribe,\\" a sort of highly specialized subculture within the larger military culture.  Although over 20 years old, this book remains powerful and relevant as a new generation of midshipman continue to learn and train in the shadow of the war on terror.	2005-02-01

Paulsen integrates interesting technical details about Civil War weapons, tactics, uniforms, and medical care into the story.  Also of note is Paulsen's account of encounters between troops and civilians.  The novel is told in a simple, matter-of-fact style that, combined with the book's often grim subject matter, can be truly devastating.	2005-02-01

Clark, is an account of the 1999 NATO military action in Kosovo from the perspective of the author, an American army general who oversaw the operation.  Clark notes that this book is \\"a personal memoir\\" and is not intended to be \\"a complete record of the war.\\"  Included as supplemental features are a \\"Cast of Characters,\\" with descriptions of over 60 individuals from the international group of people involved in the story; a list of the abbreviations used; a map; and an index.<br /><br />This is a gripping text that, at times, I found very difficult to put down.  It's a fascinating look at war from the perspective of a general near the very top of the chain of command.  Among the many issues Clark touches on are the following: the complexity of dealing with an international military alliance; humanitarian concerns; relations between military and civilian officials; and the role of the media.  He touches in particular on the complexity of his \\"double-hatted\\" role in both the NATO and U.S. military structures.  He also discusses some of his life before the Kosovo crisis.<br /><br />Particulary interesting are his memories of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, whom Clark describes early in the book as \\"a supremely manipulative liar and bully.\\"  Milosevic emerges as a wily, fascinating true-life villain.  Equally noteworthy is Clark's account of his working relationship with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, a former Spanish government minister.  Clark shows how personalities, as well as terrain, tactics, and weaponry, impact a war.<br /><br />This is a lengthy (479 plus XLV pages) and dense text; Clark hits you with a blizzard of facts, names, and acronyms.  The book may be daunting to general readers, but I believe that those who take the time to read it carefully will be rewarded.  \\"Waging\\" is not just a memoir, but also a theoretical work on modern war using the Kosovo campaign as a textbook example.

With a copyright date of 1982, this is, I believe, one of the granddaddies of all the short short anthologies.  This book brings together 38 stories that range in length from barely 2 to 8 pages.  It's truly international in scope, with authors from Russia, Germany, Switzerland, the U.S., Zimbabwe, Guatemala, and other countries.  The stories chosen also span the 19th and 20th centuries, and cover a wide range of topics: religion, war, family, crime, magic, death, censorship, and more.  A number of Nobel Prize winners are included among the chosen authors.<br /><br />In the Introduction, Irving Howe discusses the short short story, speculating that it is \\"a separate literary genre, or subgenre.\\"  He discusses differences between the short story and the short short.  My only complaint is that Howe commits what I consider the cardinal sin of anthology introductions:  he reveals too much about the content of some of the tales, thus threatening to spoil the readers' enjoyment.  Perhaps he should have divided his material into an introduction and an afterword.<br /><br />I'd like to mention some of the many highlights in this fine anthology.  \\"The Three Hermits,\\" by Leo Tolstoy: a fable-like story with a theological aspect. \\"The Third Bank of the River,\\" by Joao Guimaraes Rosa: a haunting father/son tale about a family affected by one member's bizarre behavior. \\"The Bathhouse,\\" by Mikhail Zoschenko: a humorous vignette that focuses on little indignities and annoyances of life. \\"The Use of Force,\\" by William Carlos Williams: a vividly written story about a house call that taxes a doctor's bedside manner. \\"The Blue Bouquet,\\" by Octavio Paz: a truly disturbing horror story.  And \\"The Laugher,\\" by Heinrich Boll: a first person narrative by a man employed as a professional laugher.<br /><br />This powerful and fascinating anthology successfully champions the short short as a vital, flexible, and intriguing literary genre.  The stories show a great variety in tone and setting.  I highly recommend this book for both literature courses and for individual reading.vital, flexible, and intriguing literary genre.

Hersey tells the story of the atomic bombing of the Japanese city of Hiroshima, and of the aftermath of this act.  The subtitle on the book's title page notes that this is a new edition whose final chapter was written 40 years after the fateful blast.  The copyright page further explains that an earlier version of the book was published by Knopf in 1946, and that the new edition was originally published by Knopf in 1985.<br /><br />Hersey's narrative focuses on the experiences of six people: (1) Miss Toshinki Sasaki, a clerk; (2) Dr. Masakazu Fujii, a physician who runs a private hospital; (3) Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, a tailor's widow; (4) Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a German priest; (5) Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young surgeon; and (6) the Rev. Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, a clergyman.<br /><br />The first four chapters follow these people and their associates immediately after the bombing, up to a year later.  The final chapter follows them up into the 1980s.  This is a gripping narrative, written in a sober, straightforward style that I found devastatingly effective.<br /><br />Hersey includes graphic and disturbing details as he discusses the horrific wounds and ailments suffered by the survivors.  Particularly interesting is his description of how the bombing survivors, or \\"hibakushu,\\" were a distinct group who faced unique prejudice and challenges, and had to fight for just treatment.<br /><br />The \\"About the Author\\" section at the end of the book notes that author Hersey taught at Yale for two decades and is a past Chancellor of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.  His description of Hiroshima in the days after the bombing is a powerful portrait of a city gripped by fear and uncertainty.  Also significant are the stories of the paths taken by the survivors in the decades following the blast; I was particularly intrigued by one survivor's odyssey through the United States.  \\"Hiroshima\\" is noteworthy work of American literature, and a reminder of the real human cost of war.orthy work of American literature, and a reminder of the real human cost of war.	2005-01-18

Eventually she gets an assignment as a spy for the Union cause.<br /><br />In an \\"Author's Note\\" at the end of the novel, Rinaldi explains how her fictional Sarah was inspired by the story of Sarah Emma Edmonds, a real woman who impersonated a male in order to serve in the Civil War.  Rinaldi also notes that certain key characters in the book are real historical figures.<br /><br />This is an intriguing, enjoyable story with a bold, engaging, and very admirable heroine.  Rinaldi writes incisively about the war's impact on women.  Also of note is her attention to the wartime role of health care providers.  The practical details about Civil War espionage are fascinating.  Some of the strongest parts of the book occur in the home of a suspected Confederate spy--it's a disturbingly rendered snakepit of treachery and tension.<br /><br />Rinaldi deals with the moral and psychological issues involved in espionage.  Ultimately I see Sarah as a questing heroine in a classic mold, and Rinaldi brings her odyssey to a very moving and satisfying conclusion.	2005-01-18

Beach, tells the story of several submarines of the United States Navy during World War II.  The overarching narrative begins in 1942, with narrator Beach \\"fresh out of Submarine School.\\"  We watch Beach rise up the ranks as we learn of his fellow submariners and their ships.<br /><br />Beach treats the subs as characters themselves; he notes, \\"All ships have souls, and all sailors know it\\" early in the book.  He develops this theme throughout the book.  The interwoven stories of the subs are arranged as chapters, each focusing on one or two ships.<br /><br />Beach's prose at its best is exciting and action-packed, at times reminding me of an old-fashioned motion picture adventure serial.  Yet at times he also attains an epic gravitas, and ultimately the book is quite moving.  The one criticism I will make is that at times the book felt like it could have used a more judicious editorial hand; I believe that the book's 354 pages might have been reshaped into a leaner and more efficient text without sacrificing the essentials of the narrative.<br /><br />I found \\"Submarine!\\" especially fascinating for the wealth of technical and tactical details that are interwoven into the adventure; it's a virtual encyclopedia of submarine information.  Among the many topics covered are test diving, the use of a sub to plant a minefield, dealing with defective torpedoes, how two subs can work together to attack a target, the uses of the periscope, \\"silent running,\\" and much more.<br /><br />Within the book are certain chapters that really stand out, and can even stand alone as self-contained mini-epics.  Among these is the story of the encounter between the U.S. sub _Archerfish_  and the Japanese supercarrier _Shinano_, a behemoth 50 times as massive as the sub.  This section contains some of the book's best writing.  \\"Submarine!\\" is an important and entertaining contribution to the canon of American war literature.	2005-01-18

The novel take place in 1946, just after World War II, mainly in Seattle, San Francisco, and Oklahoma.  As the story opens the headstrong young Froelich is facing a court martial for insubordination.  Soon his life and fate become entwined with that of Lieutenant Commander Timothy Danelaw, a fellow naval officer; their powerful bond dominates the story.  The novel's homosexual theme is introduced early on (page 10) as two characters discuss Oscar Wilde, and specifically Wilde as a homosexual.<br /><br />The 1991 new edition published by Alyson includes an introduction by Samuel M. Steward and an epilogue by the author.  In his intro Steward notes that the book was published in 1950.  \\"Quatrefoil\\" is a fascinating portrait of a gay male relationship in the 1940s, and the fact that it was first published in 1950 makes the text a sort of historical document itself.  AT 373 pages, the book is substantial.  The breadth of Barr's novelistic vision gives the book at times a genuine epic feel.  The story is not just about the two principal characters, but also encompasses a multigenerational family saga as well as both military and civilian lives, in war and in peace.<br /><br />While consistently intriguing and well-written, the book is not wholly satisfying.  At times I found the dialogue excessively mannered, and often I found the characters and the central relationship to be too enigmatic.  Still, there are some really vivid scenes and expertly rendered descriptive passages.  The novel is also extremely valuable as a window into a gay men's world that existed long before the Stonewall riots, civil unions, and other societal changes.  Overall, a remarkable book that deserves a wide audience.	2005-01-18

The bulk of the book focuses on the period from July 1942 to December 1945, and details her service both in the continental U.S. and in the European theater of operations.<br /><br />The author looks back at the assignments she held, which included being on the staff of the WAC training center in Des Moines and commanding a battalion-size postal unit overseas.  She also recalls the time when the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) was transformed into the WAC, thus becoming \\"an official branch of the army.\\"<br /><br />Earley tells her story in a straightforward manner.  She recalls many humorous and/or ironic incidents that happened along the way, as well as some appalling examples of racial prejudice and insensitivity that she faced.  I was also very interested by the leadership challenges that she encountered as she rose up the ranks.  She also looks at some of the very practical issues regarding the incorporation of women in the military, such as providing them with proper uniforms.<br /><br />The book is richly illustrated throughout.  There are photos of some of the historic documents from the author's career.  There are also over 40 photos detailing her service and showing many of the other soldiers--black and white, male and female, officer and enlisted--with whom she served.  I particularly enjoyed the photos showing the African-American women soldiers in action.  Lieutenant Colonel Charity Adams Earley was a true military trailblazer, and I was absolutely fascinated by the story she tells here.  Inspiring and educational, this book is a valuable contribution to the fields of women's studies, African-American studies, and military history.

Singer.  There are more than 60 entries, most of them very short.  About 140 pages long, the anthology encompasses both poetry and prose.  Each piece is accompanied by a short blurb which tells about the author and, if applicable, describes the piece's prior publication history.<br /><br />The anthology has a wide scope.  Its authors represent many parts of the United States: New Mexico, Alaska, Arizona, Utah, Montana, and other states.  Also represented are many Indian nations: Coeur d'Alene, Inuit, Navajo, Cree, Pima, Zuni, etc.  The pieces span over a century, from the 1880s to the 1990s.  The book is divided into six thematic sections: \\"Identity,\\" \\"Family,\\" \\"Homelands,\\" \\"Ritual and Ceremony,\\" \\"Education,\\" and \\"Harsh Realities.\\"<br /><br />Some of my favorite selections are as follows.  \\"My Poems,\\" by Alan Barlow: a poem with particularly vivid imagery.  \\"My Role as a Native American,\\" by Kimberly Kai Rapada: an ironic prose memoir about receiving a role in a school production of \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\"  \\"As I Dance,\\" by Autumn White Clay: an evocative poem that celebrates dance.  \\"Misconceptions about the Aleutians,\\" by Katie Mobeck: a feisty prose piece that challenges stereotypes about the author's people.<br /><br />Other topics covered include jewelry, food, prayer, role models, Native language, and the Indian relationship to the bison.  A particularly important recurring theme is the tension that comes with living between the white and Indian worlds.  As in other youth anthologies I have read, some of the pieces struck me as somewhat underdeveloped.  But the overall strength of the collection is impressive.  The voices in this book are at times satiric, ironic, and resistant, but also celebrate the joys and beauty of the Indian peoples, their lands, and their cultures.  A solid choice for both classroom use and individual reading.	2005-01-01

The story is set during the era of American slavery.  The book's narrator is Sally, a black rag doll owned by Lindy, a slave girl on a Virginia plantation.  Through Sally's eyes we see the odyssey of Lindy and her family.<br /><br />The story is told in vernacular English; for example, Sally declares, \\"Bein' Lindy's doll baby is a right important job.\\"  The atmospheric, colorful illustrations effectively enhance the emotions of the story.<br /><br />Particularly interesting is an \\"Author's Note\\" at the end of the book in which Nelson explains how she was inspired to write this story.  Telling the story from the doll's point of view is a memorable and effective device which contributes greatly to the success of this moving and beautifully illustrated book.  \\"Almost to Freedom\\" is a powerful use of African-American history in a children's book.	2004-12-31

The Bantam paperback includes a fascinating introduction by Trumbo, written in 1959 with a 1970 addendum.  The intro notes that the novel itself was written in 1938 and published just after the start of World War II.  An \\"About the Author\\" page at the book's beginning notes that the Colorado-born Trumbo was one of the screenwriters blacklisted during the McCarthy era.<br /><br />\\"Johnny\\" tells the story of Joe Bonham, an American soldier who is horrifically wounded and disabled in World War I.  The book is told from Joe's perspective as he struggles to understand and cope with his situation.  His mind wanders back and forth between his past, including his war experiences, and his immediate condition.  Thus we get a non-chronological but full picture of his complete life so far.<br /><br />Dalton's prose style in this book made a strong impact on me.  At times he seems to be assaulting the reader without mercy as he shows us the horror of war and its terrible human cost.  But the book also includes passages of hope, triumph, and heartbreaking beauty.  Joe is an unforgettable character, and this truly disturbing book remains a profoundly relevant work of American fiction.	2004-12-31

Benstock notes that the novel was serialized from 1922 to 1923 and that an edition was published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1923.  The novel tells the story of John Campton, an American portrait painter who lives in France.  Campton's son George, because he was born in France, is subject to mobilization in the French army for World War I.  As the story unfolds we see the war's impact on father and son, as well as on George's mother (from whom Campton is divorced) and her current husband, and on other individuals.<br /><br />Wharton poignantly portrays the anguish and challenges faced by the families of soldiers during wartime. She shows how the horror and violence of war touches even those who are far from the front lines.  Yes, I felt that the story briefly dragged at times and that some of the minor characters could have been better drawn, but the novel is overall interesting and at times profoundly moving.  I was particularly intrigued by the fact that George is the child not of a happy, saccharine couple, but of a divorced couple who are forced to come together over their common concern in time of war.  It is in the drama involving George's parents and stepfather where the book often has its most powerful edge.<br /><br />This book offers an interesting look at the role of soldier's families, and also of the arts community, during wartime.  Also significant is Wharton's look at the importance of personal letters as a communication medium during war.  More than eighty years after its initial publication, and with the United States once more at war, \\"A Son at the Front\\" remains a relevant work of literature by one of America's most noteworthy novelists.	2004-12-31

Jackson, has been edited by Bruce H. Norton.  The introductory materials of the book note that Jackson graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and served as an Army officer.  He resigned his commission in 1925 and enlisted as a private in the Marine Corps in 1927.  He rose to the rank of sergeant major and was made a warrant officer before retiring.  This book draws on his experiences as a prisoner-of-war held by the Japanese in the Philippines and Japan.<br /><br />This is a remarkable book.  While firmly in the tradition of the American military narrative, it is quite different in tone from any military true-life story I have ever read.  Jackson's voice is that of a folksy storyteller.  In the book he specifically mentions the tradition of military oral folklore, and his own style draws on that tradition.<br /><br />Most of the book is structured as a series of interconnected character sketches.  The gallery he presents is a very diverse group: officer and enlisted, as well as civilian; Japanese, Filipino, and American of various ethnic groups; Christian and Jew; even non-human.  I found some of the most striking pieces to be the following: \\"The Story of Lieutenant Asaka,\\" about an enigmatic Japanese prison commandant who is respected as a \\"real soldier\\" by his own enemies; \\"The Story of the Old Swede,\\" about a Marine first sergeant who is an alcoholic; and \\"The Story of First Sergeant Santaleses,\\" about a formidable soldier of the Philippine Scouts.  But my favorite tale is \\"The Story of Soochow,\\" about a little mongrel dog who becomes a Marine mascot, and stands by his Marines in battle and in prison.<br /><br />Jackson's sketches bring all of these characters to life.  Despite the serious subject matter, the author's tone is often quite funny--at times he made me laugh out loud.  But he also unflinchingly describes the horror and violence of war, and the often horrific suffering of the POWs.  Jackson also touches often on Marine tradition and esprit-de-corps.<br /><br />Jackson's is a truly extraordinary voice: witty, learned, clever, playful, and deeply humane.  This book is a valuable contribution to the canon of military narrative, as well as to the literature of imprisonment.of war, and the often horrific suffering of the POWs.

A large chunk of the book details the long odyssey that took him from Los Angeles and through France enroute to service in Spain--a quest taken in defiance of an international non-intervention pact.  This section of the book is a real adventure story with an almost dystopian flavor.<br /><br />Equally fascinating is the portion of the book detailing his actual time with the Spanish army, during which he served in a machine gun squad and as a medical laboratory technician.  Rubin explores the unique challenges in putting together a multinational, multiethnic, and multilingual fighting force.  He details the illness, discomfort, and deprivations that the troops endured in order to uphold their ideals.<br /><br />In addition to covering such down-to-earth issues as mail call and footgear, Rubin also offers some potent reflections on wartime morality and medical ethics.  Particularly interesting are his thoughts on the impact of his Jewish identity on his decision to enlist.  His writing style is largely straightforward, but graced with occasional passages of great beauty and power.<br /><br />Rubin's narrative really educated me about the unique place of Spanish Civil War veterans in the United States.  This book is a valuable and enjoyable addition to the canon of American military memoirs.	2004-12-20

The book tells the story of how this young woman becomes the masked and costumed crimefighter known as Batgirl.<br /><br />I've loved the character of Batgirl since seeing Yvonne Craig's spirited portrayal of her in the 1960s TV show \\"Batman.\\"  Beatty and Dixon's version is likewise a great Batgirl.  Although Batgirl is part of America's venerable superhero tradition, she is in her own way one of the most down-to-earth and accessible of these characters: she has no fantastic \\"superpowers\\" and is not a millionaire; as dramatized in this book, she builds her superhero persona from the ground up, with sweat and brains.<br /><br />This story shows Batgirl/Barbara's dealings with her dad, with fellow crimefighters Batman and Robin, and with the villains Killer Moth and Firefly.  The story is rich in action, humor, and interpersonal drama.  There are nice down-to-earth moments, such as details of Batgirl creating her costume and assembling her hero gear.  Along the way the artists and writers enhance the story with clever touches and thoughtful details which really help immerse the reader in Batgirl's world.<br /><br />Batgirl is a feisty, courageous, and very human character--she's a heroine I could really cheer for.  Ultimately I found this book as genuinely inspiring as it is entertaining.  Believe in Batgirl!	2004-12-16

A bibliographic note on the copyright page states that the Dover Thrift Edition \\"is a slightly altered republication of the works originally published in 1899 and 1930 by Edward Arnold, Ltd.\\"<br /><br />The book contains a series of vicious and macabre rhymes accompanied by entertaining pictures.  The poems' topics include death, accidents, cruelty towards the elderly, firearms mishaps, illness, marital discord, and murder of children.  A typical poem is \\"L'Enfant Glace,\\" which begins, \\"When Baby's cries grew hard to bear, / I popped him in the Frigidaire.\\"  A savage mockery of the human condition, \\"Ruthless Rhymes\\" is absurd, grotesque, gleefully sadistic--and lots of fun!	2004-12-16

This book is the autobiography of the legendary Apache warrior, as told to S. M. Barrett.  The copyright page notes that the main text was originally published as \\"Geronimo's Story of His Life\\" in 1906.<br /><br />The revised edition includes the 1906 preface by Barrett; a 33 page introduction by Turner; a \\"Note on the Text,\\" which describes the genesis of the book; a map, \\"Apache Country, 1865-1886\\"; a bibliography; and a generous collection of photographs showing both Geronimo at various stages in his life, and other people of his times.  Barrett's introduction tells how the text was delivered orally by Geronimo, and how translator Asa Daklugie helped Barrett turn it into book form.  Indeed, in his introduction Turner notes that Geronimo's story is \\"a preliterate and essentially a prewhite narrative.\\"  Altogether the text and supplemental features are about 200 pages long.<br /><br />Geronimo's fascinating story begins with an Apache creation myth.  He discusses his early life, his family, his battles against the Mexicans, his conflict with United States forces, and his life as a prisoner-of-war under U.S. military control.  I was especially interested by his descriptions of the military tactics he used.  Geronimo also discusses Apache life: religion, hunting, cultural taboos, etc.  The book includes some really remarkable accounts, such as Geronimo's visit to the St. Louis World's Fair.  The text is quite poignant when Geronimo reflects upon his hope for the survival of his people and their culture.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to all who are interested in Native American studies, 19th century American history, military autobiography, and the relationship between oral and written literature.  But above all, this book is an encounter with an extraordinary human being whose voice remains passionate and compelling after all these decades.	2004-12-10

The book is a surreal metafiction about a German couple in their 30s.  Harm and Dorte Peters are childless teachers who are debating whether or not to have a baby.  This debate occurs against the backdrop of the Peters' trip through the Third World.<br /><br />The narrator, who seems to be a fictionalized alter ego of author Grass, discusses writing a book or a screenplay about the Peters.  The book feels like a strange, reality-warping hybrid between a novel and a book-length essay.  Grass's themes include post-WW2 German division, the looming shadow of the Nazi era, religion, contact between the developed nations and the Third World, and German national identity.  He balances out these serious themes with a subplot involving a liver sausage.  Overall, a clever and intriguing work.	2004-12-06

The book features illustrations by Brian Kelly.  Turnipseed is a bookish misfit who would rather \\"be back in a coffee shop reading Wittgenstein\\" than serving in this war.  This is a lively and well-written memoir.  Turnipseed's witty, thoughtful prose is a pleasure to read--it's a voice steeped in pop culture and keen observation skills.<br /><br />The narrative is full of interesting details about life in a wartime \\"tent city,\\" events that occurred on truck driving missions, and other aspects of his tour.  The dialogue that he recreates is great, especially the very un-P.C. banter between Turnipseed and the other soldiers in the tent known as the \\"Dog Pound.\\"  A place where Plato meets Public Enemy, the Dog Pound is a place for uncensored discussions of race, sex, and political matters.<br /><br />Turnipseed's narrative is not just about war, but also about his struggle to find meaning, refuge, and happiness in great works of philosophy and literature--quotes from which are woven into the text.  The text is also enlivened by comic book style sections.  Turnipseed takes a critical and satirical tone towards the military, but also celebrates the troops and the unique bond that they share.  This book is also particularly valuable for giving us the voice of a reservist in a support job; it's a great complement to the \\"hardcore\\" warrior-type military memoirs available.  As a reservist in a support job (military postal service) who was called up to serve in Afghanistan, I can tell you that Turnipseed's narrative rings true; it's a highly entertaining and moving work that I recommend to both military and non-military audiences.	2004-12-06

In the preface Tonsetic notes that the book is \\"essentially a personal history\\" of his tour as a rifle company commander during the first six months of 1968--\\"the bloodiest year of the Vietnam War.\\"<br /><br />The book includes eight crisply drawn maps that illustrate the places and tactical situations covered by the text; 16 pages of black-and-white photos of people and places mentioned in the book; a useful glossary of military terms and acronyms; and a bibliography of relevant books and documents.  These supplemental features greatly enhance the book.<br /><br />But in the end it's Tonsetic's fine text that stands on its own.  Tonsetic writes in a sober, matter-of-fact prose style that I found very effective, and well suited to his subject matter.  His text is full of fascinating technical details about the art and science of 20th century warfare.  But he never gets excessively technical; his narrative remains grounded in the human dimension of his gripping story.<br /><br />Tonsetic covers a lot of ground: night fighting tactics, the danger of \\"friendly fire,\\" enemy tactics, dealing with prisoners-of-war, etc.  He writes dramatically of the leadership and staffing issues he faced as a company commander.  He vividly portrays the stress and harsh conditions endured by the hard-working infantry soldiers, and the author's compassion and respect for these men really shines through.  Tonsetic stresses in his preface that the \\"people, dates, locations, and operations described in this book are real and documented in official Army records.\\"  The author's testimony of the truthfulness of his narrative adds to the book's power.	2004-12-05

The book tells how Sherman was drafted and was classified as a noncombatant soldier; he didn't carry a weapon, but still went into Vietnam and was exposed to danger in the combat zone.  As a medic, he tended the wounds of his fellow soldiers.<br /><br />The early part of the narrative includes texts of the letters sent between Sherman and the draft board as he sought to evade combat service.  The narrative goes on to explore his work on a navy troopship and on the ground in Vietnam.  He vividly describes the sights, smells, and sounds of service in the war.<br /><br />The book is full of fascinating scenes, such as a political debate among the doctors and medics in a surgical theater.  Sherman portrays the American soldiers in Vietnam as a diverse group: people with varying backgrounds, interests, and attitudes on various topics.  Much of the book is very raw, sweaty, and in-your-face.  But parts of the book are also graced with a touching, poetic delicacy.  The final chapter includes insight on the writing of the book.<br /><br />Sherman's account of the ethics and the process of becoming a conscientious objector is truly remarkable.  He dramatically portrays the dilemma faced by young American men during the Vietnam era.  Overall, this is a well-written narrative that is, in my opinion, a valuable and distinctive addition to the canon of United States war literature.	2004-11-15

The book's dustcover notes that Yasmina Khadra is the pen name of Mohammed Moulessehoul, an Algerian army officer who used the feminine pseudonym in order to avoid censorship.<br /><br />\\"Swallows\\" is a gripping tale that takes place in Afghanistan during the reign of the Taliban.  The story revolves around the lives of the men and women who endured life under this religious fundamentalist regime.  The author vividly depicts the cruelty and violence of the regime.  The main characters include a jailer who guards the Taliban's victims and a female lawyer who chafes under the regime's sexist oppression.<br /><br />The book is full of memorable details and scenes, such as a colorfully portrayed group of disabled war veterans who congregate around a mosque.  Khadra's prose is at times grotesque, at times poetic.  We see the hopes and frustrations of the individual characters.  And we also see the possibility of compassion and redemption in a world of brutality, suffering, and injustice.  As an American soldier, I served in Afghanistan and was deeply touched by the tragedy and beauty of that land and its people; I thank both the author and translator of this book for bringing this moving tale to life.	2004-11-15

The short text (139 pages) creates an interesting portrait of a child's world in the shadow of war.  Osgood recalls such carefree activities as listening to radio programs and following baseball, as well as war-related activities like growing a \\"victory garden.\\"<br /><br />The book is hurt be an often arrogant and narcissistic tone.  Osgood spends too much time claiming how much better things were back in the 1940s and mocking contemporary children and parents.  He also presents a romanticized view of 1940s America that strikes me as unrealistic.  He briefly glosses over issues of racism and ethnic tension in a cavalier fashion.  Perhaps the low point of the book occurs in Chapter 8, where a weak attempt at \\"humor\\" involves making fun of mental illness among contemporary children.<br /><br />Despite the frequent Osgoodian inanities, I found many of the details of life in 1942 Baltimore to be quite fascinating, and Osgood's prose makes for easy and enjoyable reading.  He offers some memorable images, such as his younger self playing \\"stoopball\\" or oiling his baseball glove.  Still, in the end, I found the book curiously insubstantial.	2004-11-13

A short author bio at the start of the book notes that after the war Diggs spent nearly 40 years as a writer, reporter, and editor with \\"U.S. News and World Report.\\"<br /><br />Diggs recalls serving as an American military officer and being captured by the Germans.  He winds up in a POW camp in Poland.  The book vividly recalls the realities of life in camp: the cold, lack of sufficient food, and elaborate escape attempts.  Most remarkable is the way Diggs and the other \\"kriegies\\" (that's a slang term they used for inmates) truly formed a community.  They developed their own subculture that resisted the German captors in both blatant and subtle ways.  Diggs offers fascinating details about the camp newspaper, the educational system the inmates developed in order to make constructive use of their time, and much more.<br /><br />Diggs creates affectionate portraits of fellow kriegies who used their talents to make imprisonment more bearable for their fellow Americans.  He also discusses the important role played by Henry Soederberg, an international YMCA representative who was allowed to make humanitarian visits to the camp.  The book also covers Diggs' odyssey after leaving the camp.<br /><br />The book includes an appendix with excerpts from the Geneva Convention.  Indeed, Diggs' narrative is not just a fascinating personal narrative, but raises issues pertaining to POW treatment that remain relevant.  As an intriguing companion text, I would recommend a narrative of Japanese-American internment during WW2, such as Yoshiko Uchida's \\"Desert Exile\\" or Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and James Houston's \\"Farewell to Manzanar.\\"	2004-11-13

It's a fascinating and well-written account.  Zinsmeister offers a detailed and interesting look at the lives and work of the soldiers who serve in this war.  The text is enhanced by many pages of photographs.<br /><br />The book is full of snapshots of the interesting personalities the author encountered during his time with the 82nd.  I was especially interested in his accounts of the nitty gritty details of the soldiers' lives--food, laundry, training exercises, chapel services, etc.<br /><br />Zinsmeister vividly recalls some memorable scenes, such as his first glimpse of the historic Ziggurat of Ur.  One particularly poignant episode involves the effort to aid a horrifically wounded child.  I was also very touched by his portrait of the U.S. troops.  He describes the soldiers as a diverse group of committed professionals who have a real concern for ethics and moral behavior.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Zinsmeister spends too much of the book engaging in political argument.  I think the book would have been stronger if he had just focused on reporting the facts, rather than overtly pushing a particular political agenda.  His language during this political posturing is at times shrill and childish, especially when he resorts to name-calling.  I also found problematic his boasting that the U.S. casualties in the Iraq war were \\"stunningly low.\\"  He notes that only 196 U.S. troops had died in Iraq at the time of his writing.  But at the time I write this review that tally of dead has grown to over 1100, and the number wounded to over 8000.  Zinsmeister's boast strikes me as short-sighted and grossly inappropriate in light of what has happened since his report from Iraq.<br /><br />Despite my reservations, I enjoyed the book overall.  Like Zinsmeister, I too got to see the 82nd up close in a war zone; as an Army reservist I was mobilized and sent to support the 82nd in Afghanistan in 2003.  I too came away with great respect and admiration for the 82nd.  When Zinsmeister sticks to the facts, he creates a memorable portrait, and I thank him for his work.lose in a war zone; as an Army reservist I was mobilized and sent to support the 82nd in Afghanistan in 2003.

McDonough, chronicles the author's experiences as an officer in the Vietnam War from 1970-71.  His platoon is charged with manning an outpost next to the village of Truong Lam.<br /><br />This is a fascinating, well-written account.  McDonough fills his narrative with vivid details that really made his story come alive in my mind.  He doesn't flinch at describing the goriest and most horrific images of war.  There are also moments of irony and bitter humor.  Also noteworthy is the informative material about tactics used in Vietnam.  And the author humanizes the story by touching on such \\"down-and-dirty\\" issues as the latrine his platoon used.<br /><br />McDonough's story is populated with a compelling cast of characters.  Particularly intriguing is his exploration of relationships among the various groups he encountered in the war zone--U.S. enlisted men, his fellow Army officers, Vietnamese military allies, enemy forces, and the many civilians caught up in the conflict.<br /><br />While rich in scenes of combat, \\"Platoon Leader\\" goes beyond being just an action-packed war yarn.  The book explores the ethics and morals of war.  McDonough deals directly with the danger a soldier faces in becoming dehumanized by the brutality of war.  He vividly portrays the struggle of a leader to remain wise and humane, yet also tough and resolute, under the most trying of circumstances.  This book is both a profound meditation on wartime leadership and a powerful work of American literature.	2004-11-04

There are also a few \\"mentor pieces\\" by established Asian American women.  The book is organized thematically into 5 main sections: \\"Orientation: Finding the Way Home,\\" in which writers \\"explore the Asian American landscape\\"; \\"Family Ties,\\" which focuses on relationships with family members; \\"Dolly Rage,\\" which deals with the intersections of physical appearance, difference, and discrimination; \\"Finding My Voice,\\" about \\"wrestling with language, trying to somehow find the words to portray ourselves\\"; and finally \\"Girlwind: Emerging Voices for Change,\\" which celebrates the activism of \\"the women warriors of tomorrow.\\"<br /><br />Each author is identified by her name (except for a small number of anonymous or pseudonymous pieces), age, and town they have lived or currently live in.  Cities from many parts of the United States (California, Hawai'i, Illinois, Virginia, Wisconsin, Texas, etc.) are represented, and there is at least one writer from Canada.  The young writers, who range in age from 14 to 22, have cultural/ancestral roots in many different nations: Korea, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, India, Laos.<br /><br />Over 300 pages long, this anthology is full of fascinating selections.  Most of them are very short.  Some seem like seeds of what could become longer pieces.  Some pieces seem to whet the appetite more successfully than satisfy it, but the best pieces are really noteworthy.<br /><br />Some of the selections I found most impactful are as follows.  \\"Her Three-Inch Feet,\\" by Jenny Yu: a moving portrait of a great-aunt who had evidently undergone footbinding.  \\"The Other Sister,\\" by Kim McKee: about being adopted and having Caucasian family members.  \\"Going Undercover,\\" by Wendy M. Thompson: a reflection on having both Chinese and African American parentage.  \\"Zine Grrrl,\\" by Kristy Chan: a fascinating piece about alternative literary creativity.  \\"Waving Fans,\\" by Mia Chan Mi Park: about being the drummer for an all-Asian American female rock band.  This last piece has my favorite line from the whole book: \\"YES, Asian American women also rock. . . and we rock hard, dammit!\\"<br /><br />This book challenges stereotypes and offers bold new images of young Asian American women.  And while rooted in the Asian American female experience, the book addresses many themes that are equally relevant to men and to women of other ethnic/cultural groups.  Overall, this is a fine anthology, and a fitting companion to such groundbreaking anthologies as \\"Home Girls\\" and \\"This Bridge Called My Back.\\"  \\"YELL-Oh Girls!\\" is, in my opinion, a good choice for college courses, for reading groups, or for individual reading.n American parentage.  \\"Zine Grrrl,\\" by Kristy Chan: a fascinating piece about alternative literary creativity.  \\"Waving Fans,\\" by Mia Chan Mi Park: about being the drummer for an all-Asian American female rock band.

As the story opens we meet Zakeya, an agricultural laborer who is working the soil by the Nile River.  We soon meet her family of poor peasants, as well as the privileged ruling class of the village; the lives of these groups are intertwined in disturbing ways.<br />A note about the author tells that she was born in a village on the banks of the Nile and eventually became a doctor, and that her books have been banned.  This book reminded me a lot of &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin,&quot; the classic American novel of social protest.  In &quot;God Dies&quot; Saadawi deals with socioeconomic oppression, the sexual exploitation of women, and the intermingling of religion and politics.<br />&quot;God Dies&quot; is full of fascinating characters.  There is Metwalli, seen by some as a holy man and by others as an idiot; also memorable is Fatheya, the strong-willed wife of the leader of the village mosque.  The interpersonal conflicts and relationships of the characters are very compelling, and are punctuated by some biting dialogue.  Saadawi's vivid language has a powerful appeal to the senses; I could really imagine myself being immersed in the sights, sounds, and smells of this world.<br />At times the multiple storylines made the novel feel a bit disjointed, but ultimately Saadawi's craftsmanship gives the book a powerful unity and balance.  This is a vivid and well-written portrait of human cruelty and corruption.  As a companion text I recommend &quot;The Villagers,&quot; by Jorge Icaza.	2004-07-19

Netzley, packs a lot of information into more than 250 pages.  The bulk of the book consists of alphabetically arranged short articles.  Also included are a bibliography and index.<br />The entries themselves fall into a number of categories: general subjects (Accommodations, Clothing, Culture Shock, Military Service, etc.); places both general and specific (Africa, Asia, Mount Everest, etc.); important books in the field of women's travel; types of female travelers (Missionaries, Pilgrims, Pirates, Queens, Spies, etc.).  There is an assortment of other articles on various interesting subjects (Mountaineering, the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., the Iditarod Dog Sled Race, etc.).<br />There are also many entries devoted to individual travelers and explorers.  It's truly a multicultural and international gathering of women: Clara Barton (a Red Cross leader), Nellie Bly (journalist), Susan Butcher (American dogsledder), Hsi Kai Ching Yih (19th century pirate of China), Jane Goodall (pioneer in chimpanzee research), Zora Neale Hurston (African-American anthropologist and writer), Margery Kempe (religious pilgrim of the Middle Ages), Junko Tabei (Japanese mountaineer), Edith Wharton (American writer), and many, many, more.<br />It is fascinating to read of the lives of these women and learn of the huge diversity of reasons that led them to travel or explore.  Netzley incorporates bibliographic references into the entries, so interested individuals have starting points for further reading.  The book also includes a wealth of black-and-white photos of various women profiled in the book.  Overall, this is an informative and enjoyable reference work that celebrates the courage, skills, and passion of generations of bold women.	2004-06-20

Writer-illustrator Davis combines wacky, cartoony illustrations with a clever and enjoyable text.<br />The blue-skinned, green-haired Mabel is a character with a lot of visual appeal.  The pictures are bursting with bright, bold colors; there are also lots of witty sight gags and other enjoyable details.  The book contains positive messages about friendship, responsibility, having pride in one's work, and practicing good oral hygiene.  The combination of these educational elements with light-hearted humor makes this book a real gem.  I recommend &quot;Mabel&quot; not only for children, but also as a fun gift for any dental professional.	2004-06-18

Early Poems 1913-1918,&quot; by Vladimir Mayakovsky, features poems translated into English by Maria Enzensberger.  Also included is a foreword by Elaine Feinstein.  This 63-page book has been published as Pocket Poets Series No. 47.<br />This book was my introduction to the voice of Russian poet Mayakovsky (1893-1930).  In her interesting introduction translator Enzensberger puts his work in context.  She includes a humorous and charming story about the beginning of his poetic career, and also discusses his relationship to the futurist movement.  The book reproduces a rich selection of visual materials: photos, lithographs, drawings, and even some of Mayakovsky's own handwritten notes.<br />Mayakovsky's poetry is fascinating.  His voice is full of absurdism and playful humor.  Yet the poetry is also touched by a tragic vision; his voice sounds genuinely compassionate towards beings (both human and non-human) that are suffering.  The poems raise lofty theological issues, yet remain grounded in very concrete and specific worldly things: smoked sardines, manure, galoshes, etc.  A number of pieces deal with poetry itself.<br />Mayakovsky's language, as rendered into English by Enzensberger, has a wonderfully muscular, meaty, yet musical quality--truly poetry that should be read aloud.  At times Mayakovsky's vision and voice reminded me of those of Pablo Neruda and Walt Whitman, whom I see as his poetic soul brothers.  At his best, Mayakovsky has a poetic voice that is graced with prophecy and magic.	2004-06-18

The main sections of the book are as follows: a lengthy introduction; a series of entries on great jewelry designers (Tiffany and Co., Faberge, Cartier, etc.); a chapter with advice on integrating jewelry into one's overall fashion sense; a large section on Joan Rivers' own costume jewelry line, the Classics Collection; and a chapter describing how jewelry is made.  Also included are shopping tips, a bibliography and index.<br />The book combines an interesting text with a wealth of clear, full-color photos that are sparkling with detail.  Rivers enlivens the text with enjoyable personal anecdotes.  The section on jewelry and fashion includes shots of Joan modeling different clothes-and-jewelry combos, and has an empowering message that encourages readers to create their own style without being stifled by someone else's rules.<br />There are some wonderful photos of and stories about some of the fine jewelry pieces in Joan's own collection; one of the most dazzling pieces is a necklace, once owned by Queen Marie of Romania, that contains many colorful eggs and charms. The section about how jewelry is made shows, in text and photos, the process from rough design sketch all the way to finished product.  It's absolutely fascinating.<br />The book's largest section is devoted to photos and descriptive text about Joan's own costume jewelry line.  The Classics Collection pieces profiled include necklaces, earrings, bracelets, brooches, etc.  It's a rich and colorful variety of pieces.  Many motifs and elements appear, and there are synthetic/faux gems of many different shapes, sizes, and colors.  Some pieces are whimsical, some bold and dramatic.

The book is edited, with an introduction and notes by, Cathy N. Davidson and Ada Norris.  Born on the Yankton Sioux reservation in South Dakota in 1876, Zitkala-Sa worked as a writer and activist for Native American causes, and died in 1938.<br />The editors divide Zitkala-Sa's writings into 4 main sections: &quot;Old Indian Legends,&quot; &quot;American Indian Stories,&quot; &quot;Selections from _American Indian Magazine_,&quot; and &quot;Poetry, Pamphlets, Essays, and Speeches.&quot;  I really loved the legends, which are Zitkala-Sa's versions of tales that had been passed down orally.  These stories are full of magic, transformations, fantastic beings, and amazing feats.  Many tales feature Iktomi, a &quot;spider fairy&quot; who is a mischievous trickster.<br />The section on stories features realistic narratives of Indian lives.  All together these stories create a vivid and fascinating portrait, with details about Indian crafts, food preparation, and social customs.  The many nonfiction pieces in the book cover a number of topics, such as Native American soldiers in World War I, Native American religion, and Indian political issues.  Many of these pieces show the author to be a really forward thinking woman with a global perspective; her acknowledgement of the &quot;universal cry for freedom from injustice&quot; really seems to foreshadow the work of Martin Luther King, Jr. and other great activist-writers of the later 20th century.<br />The book is full of great supplemental materials: a comprehensive introduction; a lengthy bibliographic list of suggestions for further reading; an informative note on the texts; and endnotes.  Zitkala-Sa is truly a fascinating figure.  As the book's introduction notes, she &quot;trod the unstable terrain between radicalism, separatism, assimilationism, and intermittent conservatism.&quot;  The American Indian experience as embodied in her writings shows both fascinating parallels and contrasts with other ethnic American experiences.  I consider this book a valuable contribution to Native American studies, women's studies, and American literature; I recommend it highly both for classroom use and individual reading..&quot;  The American Indian experience as embodied in her writings shows both fascinating parallels and contrasts with other ethnic American experiences.

Houston.  In a foreword Jeanne Houston notes that this book, which tells about the internment of a Japanese-American family during World War II, is a true story.  &quot;Farewell&quot; is a rich and fascinating chronicle.  The Houstons follow the lives of the members of the Wakatsuki family before, during, and after the experience of internment.<br />The narrative is full of compelling details of the family's experiences.  It is particularly intriguing to watch how the internment camp evolved into &quot;a world unto itself, with its own logic&quot;--a &quot;desert ghetto.&quot;  During the course of the book the authors discuss many important topics: religion, education, anti-Asian bigotry, the impact of the Pearl Harbor attack, the military service of Japanese-Americans during the war, and more.<br />The Houstons write vividly of the dislocation, humiliation, and injustice faced by the Wakatsuki family.  Also powerful is the narrator's struggle to come to terms with her own ethnic identity.<br />For an interesting companion text, I would suggest &quot;Desert Exile,&quot; by Yoshiko Uchida; this book also deals with the internment experience, but from a somewhat different perspective which complements that of the Houstons.  I was moved by &quot;Farewell.&quot;  The book is a profound meditation on both the hope and the tragedy of the United States, in which the &quot;American dream&quot; can become intermingled with American nightmares.  I consider this book an important addition to Asian-American studies in particular, and to the canon of multiethnic U.S. literature in general.	2004-06-15

This anthology (of 259 + xxvi pages) features the work of over 50 contributors.  The editor's note by Sonnie declares that this book is &quot;_by_ and _for_ queer and questioning youth&quot;--it is explained that the word &quot;queer&quot; is employed &quot;as an umbrella term for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered people.&quot;  Also noted is that the contributors range in age from 14 to 26.<br />The selections in the book are very diverse in genre: visual art, poetry, prose, performance pieces, interviews, diary excerpts.  The contributors are also a diverse group, representing many different ethnic/cultural backgrounds.  There is a first-person statement from each reviewer that prefaces her/his contribution; also featured are photos of most of the contributors.<br />The book includes &quot;Queer 101,&quot; an intriguing glossary of relevant terminology (&quot;ageism,&quot; &quot;FTM,&quot; &quot;monosexism,&quot; &quot;ze,&quot; etc.).  Particulary thoughtful is the inclusion of a section on resources for queer youth: crisis hotlines, ethnic organizations, religious support groups, etc.<br />Yes, some pieces are raw and amateurish, and at times the voices sound pretentious or self-indulgent.  But overall the collection is thought-provoking, and at times it is very moving.  There were many themes in the book that struck me as particularly significant: being bi- or multiethnic; &quot;coming out&quot;: being aware of (and resisting) interlocking systems of oppression; anxiety about invisibility and assimilation; etc.<br />I found certain pieces particularly memorable.  In &quot;Different: My Experiences as an Intersexed Gay Boy,&quot; S. Asher Hanley notes how an intersex person can be marginalized in both straight and gay society.  &quot;Tasting Home,&quot; by Uchechi Kalu, is a compelling poem that deals with immigration and bilingualism.  &quot;Straight-Out Pain,&quot; a poem by Antigona, is about undergoing an exorcism.  But I found the most moving piece to be &quot;The Memory of Bathing,&quot; by Qwo-Li Driskell; this short but powerful prose piece recounts a political/emotional epiphany he experienced while attending a national HIV/AIDS forum.<br />One could consider poet-activists Audre Lorde and June Jordan to be the god(dess)mothers of this collection; each woman receives multiple mentions in the course of the anthology, and the book as a whole really reflects the artistic and political principles that each woman lived out in her life and remarkable work.

More than 700 pages long, the book is full of alphabetically organized articles.  The book's preface notes that the articles range in length from 100 to 2000 words.<br />The &quot;Companion&quot; is truly vast in scope.  Subjects covered include Aboriginal topics (art, history, languages, etc.); people (opera singer Harold Blair, Olympic athlete Betty Cuthbert, suffragist Alice Henry, etc.); cities (Adelaide, Hobart, etc.); newspapers (the &quot;Argus&quot; of Melbourne, the &quot;Canberra Times,&quot; etc.); religious bodies and movements (the Uniting Church, etc.); important events (the Cape Grim massacre, the Castle Hill Rising, etc.); political parties; various ethnic groups in Australia, and more.<br />I particularly appreciated the entries on Australian colloquial terms like &quot;Pommy&quot; and &quot;reffo.&quot;  There are also many articles that address certain big topics in Australian context: agriculture, censorship, feminism, the film industry, literature, social justice, etc.  And interspersed throughout are entries on many other interesting topics: the Bunyip (a mythic animal), convict history, &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; (a song), Internet resources, pubs, Vegemite (a food), etc.<br />Also included: maps, a useful subject index, and a 9-page directory of the book's many contributors.  Many bibliographic references are incorporated into the individual entries, making this a good starting place for more in-depth reading on particular topics.  The &quot;Companion&quot; is an achievement as big and colorful as Australia itself.  While this book is certainly a logical choice for the reference section of any good library, it's also a good book for any individual with an interest in or love for Australia.	2004-05-28

Gems also wrote the introduction to the book, in which she praises Lorca as one of Spain's greatest artists of all time.  A note before the beginning of the play notes that this adaptation was first presented in Manchester in 2003.<br />The title character of Yerma is a rural wife who is frustrated because she has not yet given birth to a child.  The play follows her conflict with her husband and interactions with other characters.  &quot;Yerma&quot; certainly raises some important issues: marriage, gender roles, motherhood, trust, and honor.  And there is some wonderfully poetic language.  But overall I found this play dull and uninteresting; moreover, the characters never really engaged me.  For better examples of Gems' talent, I suggest the fine plays &quot;Marlene&quot; and &quot;The Snow Palace.&quot;	2004-05-28

Kumashiro, is an anthology with a very tight focus (as indicated by the title).  The bulk of the book consists of 17 autobiographical pieces written by different activists.  In addition, the book contains a foreword, a preface, an afterword, an index, and capsule biographies of the contributors.<br />The entire book runs 137 plus xxvii pages long.  The longest of the biographies is 13 pages, and most are under 10 pages long.  While focused on a particular group of people, the book celebrates a tremendous diversity within that group.  Many voices are heard: lesbian, gay male, bisexual (male and female), transgender and intersex.  Ethnic experiences represented include Nepali, Filipino, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, and more, including individuals who identify as bi- or multiethnic.<br />The stories in this book also take the reader across a vast portion of the United States: to Hawai'i; Long Island, New York; Silicon Valley, California; Connecticut; Decatur, Illinois; San Francisco; Detroit; and elsewhere.  Certain recurring themes unify the collection as a whole: the &quot;coming out&quot; experience; the impact of pop culture upon the authors' lives; family relations; religion; dealing with multiple/overlapping identities; and the importance of joining or founding support organizations.<br />I'd like to mention a few selections that I found particularly memorable.  &quot;Curry Potatoes and Rainbow Banners,&quot; by Nur-e-alam S. Chisty, includes a compelling account of elementary school racism.  &quot;You're a What?  An Activist??&quot;  by Alain Anh-Tuan Dang, recalls the author's fight against abusive Vietnamese sweatshops.  In &quot;South of Normal,&quot; Loren R.

The book tells the story of Baba Yaga, a Russian witch who flies around in a giant mortar-and-pestle.  Her goal: to kidnap and eat a child!<br />In the afterword, Yolen notes that she read a number of Baba Yaga stories in 3 books, but that the story here is her own.  I imagine that a story whose main character wants to abduct and eat a child might not suit all tastes (forgive the pun), and that the portrayal of such a villainous witch might offend some Wiccan readers.  But those issues aside, this is a wacky, fun, deliciously macabre book.  The illustrations are really wonderful; Vagin successfully combines down-to-earth detail with fantastic imagery.  Together the text and illustrations create a fairy tale world that has color and bite.	2004-05-20

Authors from every continent except Antarctica are represented.  The stories represent a healthy variety of approaches--humor, horror, fairy tale, the grotesque, satire, realism, etc.  There is also an excellent variety in terms of story length, ranging from a 50-page entry to stories of only 4 pages, with a nice mix of lengths in between.  At over 460 pages long, it's a hefty collection.<br />I'll mention a few of the highlights.  &quot;The Jewess,&quot; by Irene Dische of Germany: About a German-American's trip to Germany to deal with his inheritance, this is a disturbing piece that deals with family history, Jewish identity, and the shadow of the Nazi era.  &quot;Nineteen Fifty-Five,&quot; by Alice Walker of the USA: About the relationship between an African-American female singer-songwriter and a white male performer, this is an interesting meditation on art and creativity.  &quot;A Wilderness Station,&quot; by Alice Munro of Canada: The story of a frontier wife, told in fragments from multiple voices.  One of the longer selections, it's a fascinating and richly peopled story.  &quot;Distant View of a Minaret,&quot; by Alifa Rifaat of Egypt: Compact but deliciously ironic glimpse inside a marriage in Cairo.  &quot;In the Family,&quot; by Maria Elena Llano of Cuba: Macabre, witty, and humorous tale about a mirror with a supernatural power.  &quot;Broken Transformers,&quot; by Bi Shumin of China: a very down-to-earth story about the impact of an expensive child's toy on a financially struggling Chinese family.<br />There are many other memorable stories; other countries represented include Russia, Botswana, Japan, France, Australia, and others.  A rich variety of themes are covered.  I really enjoyed this book and recommend it for college courses, book discussion groups, or individual reading.	2004-05-20

The book covers the history of Spider-Man as the character and his world have developed in the comic books.  Included in the book's artwork are reproductions of many comic book covers spanning decades of Spider-Man's history.<br />The book includes information about Peter Parker, his family and friends, Spider-Man's origin and fantastic abilities, and Spider-Man's allies.  Topics such as Spider-Girl and Spider-Man 2099 are also covered.  A great deal of space is devoted to the many supervillains faced by Spidey over the decades: the Vulture, Doctor Octopus, the Lizard, Mysterio, Silver Sable, Venom, Carnage, and many more.  Also fascinating is the book's coverage of important storylines such as the history of Spider-man's clone.<br />The book includes a foreword by Spider-Man creator Stan Lee, an index, and a gazetteer that lists the first appearances of many characters.  This is a really enjoyable and informative book.  The illustrations give the book tremendous visual appeal.  DeFalco really gives you a sense of the epic sweep of the Spider-Man mythos--I felt I was getting a comprehensive look at a richly peopled saga that is full of drama, tragedy, and hope.	2004-05-17

The text is a simple poem, told in the 1st person by a child character.  The narrator expresses her joy at making music in a variety of ways: playing a toy xylophone, simply slapping her thigh, and more.  Sample text: &quot;I make good music/ on my drums,/ I make good music/ with my thumbs.&quot;  The bright, colorful artwork is effective although not especially outstanding.  Overall, a fun book.	2004-05-12

The text and pictures look at the life cycle of a ladybug, including hatching, metamorphosis, and eventual egg-laying.  The book includes a glossary of terms (&quot;aphid,&quot; &quot;larva,&quot; etc.).<br />Himmelman has crafted some wonderful images: golden ladybug eggs clustered on a green leaf, a ladybug dwarfed by a fierce looking preying mantis, and more.  The artist brings to vivid life a world of savage beauty--it's like looking at an exotic science fiction landscape.  The book shows predation and evasion of predation, but is not gory and deals with these realities of insect life in a matter-of-fact way.  This book is another triumph for the talented Himmelman, who has created in these pages a world that is rich in color, action, and drama.	2004-05-12

The title character--a clown about to mark his 100th birthday--tells the audience the story of his life, which spans the 20th century.  The monologue begins with his beginnings as the child of a Gypsy prostitute in Trinidad and proceeds as his adventures take him across various countries.<br />Early in the play the clown promises &quot;an obscene and enchanting spectacle that will thrill you and revolt you.&quot;  The entire text of the play only fills 32 pages, but into this concise space Butcher created a work with global vision and an epic sweep.  Scaramouche's story is tragic, comic, and richly ironic; his monologue is full of fascinating characters and compelling situations.<br />This Methuen edition contains an 11-page long, unpaginated prefatory section with information about the play's production history.  The play was first performed at the Samuel Beckett Theatre for the Dublin Theatre Festival 2001, and received its first UK performance in 2002.  Also noted is that playwright Butcher studied at Oxford and trained at Drama Studio London.<br />Butcher's language pulses and crackles with life.  In Scaramouche's words he weaves a pungent yet elegant poetry that is spiced with multilingual flourishes and multicultural references.  Although I have never seen it performed, I can say that the play succeeds brilliantly as a reader's text.  Scaramouche is an amazing character.  Ultimately this play is a moving meditation on loss, lust, and power, as well as on history, justice, and national identity.	2004-05-12

It is illustrated with many black-and-white depictions of both animated and live-action characters.  The bulk of the book is an alphabetically organized group of entries on specific superheroes.<br />A typical entry discusses a superhero and the various film and TV incarnations in which he/she has appeared.  Muir discusses many types of superhero portrayals: animated and live-action, black-and-white and color, serious and spoof, and adult- and kid-oriented productions, even including direct-to-video features.  The book is amazingly comprehensive, including both solo heroes and teams.  There are the expected entries on such &quot;big&quot; names as The Amazing Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, X-Men, etc.  But Muir does not neglect the curious, cultish, or off-beat.<br />Among the many heroes covered are the Ambiguously Gay Duo (from a series of animated shorts on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;), Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Captain Planet and the Planeteers, Darkman, ElectraWoman and DynaGirl, Isis, M.A.N.T.I.S., the Six Million Dollar Man, the Tick, and many more.  I don't doubt that there are omissions or oversights (I would have liked to have seen an entry on the Bibleman character, portrayed by Willie Aames), but overall it's an impressively broad gathering of heroes.  The entries feature cast and crew credits from various productions, as well as episode guides to TV series.  Excerpts from critics' reviews add further to the entries.  Among the fascinating topics covered along the way are the superhero underpinnings of the film &quot;Unbreakable&quot; and the notorious unreleased Fantastic Four film.<br />The book includes endnotes, a bibliography, and an index, as well as a number of appendices.  I found the most interesting appendix to be the one covering the cliches and conventions of superhero media: &quot;The Dogged Reporter,&quot; &quot;Gargoyle Pose,&quot; &quot;Lost Powers,&quot; etc.<br />This book is well-written and fascinating.  Muir takes the genre seriously, and brings insight and intelligence to this project.  He is also not afraid to be critical.  In his introduction he puts superhero lore into the context of United States culture.  He also discusses his rationale for excluding or including certain characters when writing the book.  I consider this book an essential reference work for public and academic libraries.

The title is a nod to the classic lesbian novel &quot;Rubyfruit Jungle.&quot;  Overall the book brings lesbian and gay male issues to the forefront in funny ways.  Natalie's work is satiric with effective doses of absurdism.<br />Natalie is frank and fearless as she takes on a variety of issues: homosexuality in the military, body piercing, sperm donation, the Christian &quot;ex-gay&quot; phenomenon, safe sex, political correctness, etc.  Some of the celebrities and cultural icons spoofed along the way include Jesse Helms, Ross Perot, Barbie, and the duo of Bert and Ernie.<br />The emphasis is on the human condition, but some of the funniest cartoons feature anthropomorphized non-human characters.  There are lots of clever highlights, such as a depiction of S&amp;M among lesbian cows and a lesbian version of the &quot;12 Days of Christmas&quot; carol (including &quot;two turkey basters&quot;).<br />Natalie's work reminds me, in style and substance, somewhat of the work of two other marvelous cartoonists, John Callahan and Gary Larson.  But the strong gay/lesbian thematic element in her work distinguishes her.  These cartoons can be quite scathing, brazenly sexual and pointedly political.  But ultimately the tone of gleeful, uninhibited mockery is what makes &quot;Rubyfruit Mountain&quot; so much fun.	2004-05-09

Daniel, is an anthology of stories that do not exceed 55 words in length.  The introduction refers to the 55-word story as a &quot;sub-genre of the short story.&quot;  This collection demonstrates the possibilities of this sub-genre.<br />The stories cover a broad range of subject matter: technology, murder, sexual orientation, greed, lust, etc.  The editors include science fiction and the supernatural.  There are riffs on established literary works, and lots of pop culture references.<br />Although some selections are gimmicky, overall this is a good collection.  A number of stories end with a twist.  The book ends with a section entitled &quot;How to Write a 55-Word Story,&quot; which should be particularly useful for teachers.	2004-05-07

Post, features photographs by Chip Clark.  The book is a beautiful celebration of the title collection, which is part of the Smithsonian Institution.  The informative text discusses the history of the collection, facts about types of different gemstones, and specific pieces in the collection.<br />The full-color photography is really stunning, and brings a rich assortment of gems to glorious life.  Some of the historic pieces pictured are the blue Hope Diamond, the diamond Napoleon Necklace, the Hooker Emerald, and more.  Also shown are a colorful collection of &quot;fancy&quot; diamonds, a rare red diamond, the 858-carat uncut Gachala Emerald, the delightful &quot;pink tutu&quot; (a band of dainty rose quartz crystals on a large smoky quartz crystal), a dazzling group of fire opals, a lapis lazuli carving from Afghanistan, and more.<br />I appreciate how the book celebrates gemstones at various stages: uncut, cut, and set in artfully crafted pieces of jewelry.  Many different types of gemstones--aquamarine, garnet, spinel, chrysoberyl, turquoise, etc.--are covered.  Features such as a scanning electron microscope photo of the inner structure of an opal give the reader a deeper understanding of the science behind gems.  From start to finish, this book is a marvelous feast for both the eyes and the brain.	2004-05-04

The artist brings new life to this rhyme with her whimsical, quirky creations.  She makes very effective use of pastel colors set against a star-spangled, dark night sky.  Her artwork is full of fun and imaginative touches, such as the lavender pinstripes on the cat's trousers.  Winter has visualized a surreal fantasy landscape that is cheery and inviting, and populated with friendly-looking characters.	2004-05-04

The book combines a simple text with beautiful images.  Also included is a short glossary of terms.  Set on a farm, the book tells the story of a mealworm's life from her being laid as an egg to the hatching of her own offspring.  The text covers its main character's metamorphoses, encounters with other creatures, etc.<br />This superb book brings a sense of both dignity and magic to the life of this tiny creature.  The illustrations are truly beautiful and are rich in subtle details--the scales on a chicken's foot, the patterns on a moth's wings, etc.  The rich shades of brown, green, and gold bring a luminous warmth to the book.  Himmelman includes some clever visual touches that bring an almost cinematic sense of drama to this miniature epic of one little life.  Among the many nature and science picture books for children that I've read, I would certainly rate this as among the best.	2004-04-22

Rey&quot; by Martha Weston.  In this tale, George--&quot;a good little monkey and always very curious&quot;--visits the public library with his friend, the man in the yellow hat.  Chaos ensues as George frolics through the library, but it all ends happily.<br />Curious George is an enduring cultural icon, and this book is an enjoyable addition to his adventures.  He's a cute and likeable character, and despite his disruptive antics, his love of books makes him admirable.  Although mischievous, he is never malicious, and his attitude throughout is positive.  Weston creates a nice portrait of a multiethnic community at the public library.  Her illustrations are full of clever visual touches and entertaining details.  If you're a fan of the curious monkey, don't miss this book.	2004-04-22

The anthology is divided into 8 thematic sections, each of which begins with a poem by an established poet (Langston Hughes, Alexis de Veaux, Lucille Clifton, etc.).  The sections are entitled as follows: &quot;Wearing Our Pride: Poems about Black Pride, Unity, and Beauty,&quot; &quot;We, the Observers: Poems about the Poet as Keeper of the Oral Tradition,&quot; &quot;Motherlands and the 'Hood: Poems about Home and Homelessness,&quot; &quot;Trip to My Soul: Poems that Reflect on Self and Spirit,&quot; &quot;Love Rhythms: Poems about Falling in Love and the Music it Brings,&quot; &quot;The Struggle Continues: Poems about the Fight for Freedom,&quot; &quot;After Tomorrow: Poems about Hopes and Dreams of a Brighter Future,&quot; and &quot;To Our Elders: Poems that Salute Ancestors, Elders, and Mentors.&quot;<br />The poems are mostly written by poets who were in their teens.  Each poem is accompanied by identification of the author's country and the age at which he/she wrote the poem.  The book also includes biographical notes on each poet.  The book has an international scope; in her introduction compiler Okutoro writes about her own Nigerian-American background and notes that the anthology &quot;is a celebration of the African Diaspora&quot; through the eyes of young people.  Among the countries represented by the poets in this book are Somalia, Uganda, Haiti, Canada, and more.  However, the poets represented overall are overwhelmingly from the U.S.A., so while the international approach is admirable, I don't think that the book fully achieves this vision.<br />Still, &quot;Quiet Storm&quot; is a frequently powerful and thought-provoking collection.  Some of my favorite selections are as follows. &quot;My First Love,&quot; by Jennifer McClune of New York: a love poem to black hair, written in vivid, muscular language.  &quot;A Missing Sun,&quot; by Kia Hayes of Pennsylvania: full of rich, startling imagery.  &quot;Deracinee,&quot; by Marie-Sabine Thomas of Haiti and Zaire: a fascinating meditation of ethnic and linguistic identity.  And &quot;The Question,&quot; by Amy E. Auzenne of Texas: a powerful poem about being a light-skinned black person.  Overall, it's a vibrant and memorable anthology that I recommend both to teen and older readers.t;A Missing Sun,&quot; by Kia Hayes of Pennsylvania: full of rich, startling imagery.  &quot;Deracinee,&quot; by Marie-Sabine Thomas of Haiti and Zaire: a fascinating meditation of ethnic and linguistic identity.

Wirth, who also wrote the introduction.  Also included is a foreword by Henry Louis Gates Jr.  Over 300 pages long, this book offers a comprehensive and compelling look at Nugent (1906-1987).  In his foreword Gates writes that Nugent was &quot;boldly and proudly gay&quot; and that he &quot;linked the black world of the Harlem Renaissance with the gay world of bohemian New York.&quot;<br />Wirth's fascinating, 61 page introduction is full of photos and illustrations.  Wirth looks at Nugent's life and work; among the topics covered are Nugent's relationships to other Harlem Renaissance figures and his involvement with the periodical &quot;Fire!!&quot;.<br />A note to the reader tell us that the book includes previously unpublished work taken directly from manuscript.  Overall there is a rich selection of material.  Among the pieces included in this book are the short story &quot;Smoke, Lilies and Jade,&quot; an oft-reprinted piece described as &quot;Nugent's most important work&quot;; poems; an essay entitled &quot;On Harlem&quot; which was written for the Federal Writers' Project in the late 1930s; excerpts from an unpublished novel; and more.  There are also many reproductions (both color and black-and-white) of Nugent's artwork.<br />&quot;Gay Rebel&quot; is a superb contribution to both African-American studies and gay studies.  But beyond that it's a very moving tribute to a remarkable cultural figure.	2004-04-09

There are also a number of appendices, including a hallmark identification guide and a guide to the marks and names on Mexican silver jewelry and metalware.<br />The 272-page book is full of hundreds of clear, beautiful full color photos of jewelry.  Each photo is accompanied by essential information on each piece depicted.  The items shown represent a huge price span; in this book you'll see a $336,000.00 gem-encrusted platinum bracelet, a $10.00 brooch shaped like a poodle, and lots in between.  Many types of jewelry are pictured: necklaces, cufflinks, earrings, lockets, scarf pins, etc.  Included are pieces representing a broad variety of artistic approaches: whimsical, elegant, gaudy, graceful, fierce, futuristic.<br />Also fascinating is the broad range of materials covered: diamonds, emeralds, opals, turquoise, gold, coral, agate, wood, rhinestones, plastic, brass, porcelain, etc.  The photography is accompanied by an interesting, well-written text.  Jewelry production is placed in historical and cultural context.  There are also special sections devoted to jewelry of particular cultures (Native American, Mexican, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Finnish).  Interesting trends such as Victorian-era black jewelry and &quot;eye miniatures&quot; are also highlighted.  Overall, this is an endlessly interesting and stunningly beautiful reference work.	2004-04-09

Lippert with illustrations by Julie Paschkis.  The book jacket notes that this is a retelling of a Liberian story, and that coauthor Paye is from Liberia and was trained as a storyteller by his grandmother.<br />The story tells how Mrs. Chicken, while trying to see her reflection in the river, encounters the toothy croc of the title.  Mrs. C tries to outwit the croc in order to avoid becoming a chicken dinner.  This is a great story: it's funny, features a high stakes conflict between two strong female characters, and has suspenseful plot twists.  There is a delicious irony throughout.  Paschkis' colorful drawings perfectly complement the story.  The artwork has a whimsical quality and clever visual touches; the main characters are particularly well realized.	2004-03-19

Bader) and features illustrations by John Delaney and Dave Cooper.  The story is set in the world of the &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; TV series, in which an elderly Bruce Wayne has passed the duties of Batman on to young Terry McGinnis.  In this adventure, told in comic-book format, Batman battles the villain Blight and encounters a group of orphans living in tunnels under the city.<br />The story is effectively told and contains some solid action scenes.  The characters are well drawn, particularly the creepy Blight.  However, the book's weak aspect is its handling of the very serious themes of homelessness and orphanhood.  This problematic aspect of the book ultimately leads to a too easy, distastefully saccharine resolution.	2004-03-19

These illustrations are drawings (not photographs, as is the case in many other books on jewelry).  These drawings are very well done; they are lively with color and intricate detail.<br />The illustrated pieces reflect a rich variety of motifs and stylistic approaches: bold geometric forms, floral designs, whimsical characters, religious iconography, etc.  The book also includes a section with short biographies of designers and companies; among those profiled are Boucher &amp; Cie, Hattie Carnegie, Faberge, Rene Lalique, Paloma Picasso, Swarovski, and more.<br />Yes, the contents of this book are truly beautiful to look at.  But I found the book's arrangement to be somewhat cumbersome.  The captions to the pictures are on separate pages, often several pages away, so I found myself constantly flipping back and forth in the book just to identify the pieces.  To identify a piece, you have to go to the separate page which contains small black-and-white numbered outlines of the pieces on the page you were initially looking at.  These numbers are tied to a set of captions next to the key diagram.  It struck me as an excessively complicated system; I have seen other jewelry overview books which keep the captions and illustrations on the same page in a more user-friendly system.  Still, the beauty and variety within this book make it worthwhile.	2004-03-19
739900:US	51987970	R2V829QFP2TOFD	1890627356	391397395	All Kinds of Friends, Even Green!	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A memorable friendship	&quot;All Kinds of Friends, Even Green!&quot; is written and photographed by Ellen B. Senisi.  The text and photos tell a story about Moses, a disabled boy who gets around in his wheelchair.  At school, his class is given an assignment to write about friends.  Moses is inspired to write about a very special friend: Zaki, an iguana.  Zaki is also disabled, having lost her back toes after a mite infection; Moses has a special affection with her.<br />This is a wonderful portrait of a multiethnic school environment that includes disabled youngsters.  The acknowledgement section of the book thanks the participants at Zoller School in Schenectady, New York.  After the main text there are three interesting supplemental articles: about disabilities, about young Moses, and about iguanas.  The colorful, lively photos are enjoyable to look at.  This book effectively reminds us that disability is an issue that affects both human and non-human beings.  Moses and Zaki are likeable and admirable &quot;characters,&quot; and the book movingly celebrates the special love a child has for a cherished pet.	2004-03-19

Included are a substantial introductory essay, short author biographies, a map of Australia, a glossary of Australian terms, and a list of suggested readings.<br />The anthology is broken down thematically.  Part I is &quot;The Idea of the Bush.&quot;  Part II, &quot;Images of Australia,&quot; is further broken down into 3 subsections: &quot;The Aboriginal Experience,&quot; &quot;The Convict,&quot; and &quot;The Search for a National Identity.&quot;  Part III is &quot;Relationships.&quot;  Altogether there is a rich sampling of fiction and autobiographical writing.  The anthology covers many themes and ideas:  family ties, relations between the people and the land, socioeconomic status, education, Aboriginal culture, gay life, marriage, crime, etc.<br />There are a number of standouts in this overall solid collection. &quot;The Chosen Vessel,&quot; by Barbara Baynton, is a chilling suspense tale.  &quot;The Loaded Dog,&quot; by Henry Lawson, is a wild piece of slapstick comedy.  &quot;Northern Belle,&quot; by Thea Astley, is a powerful character study that deals with the intersection of racial anxiety and gender roles.  Excerpts from &quot;A Fortunate Life,&quot; by A.B. Facey, offer a graphic look at the horror of war.  This is a rich and diverse collection, well suited both for literature classes and individual reading.	2004-03-11
759114:US	51987970	R1ZOSFO7C24SPV	0883781042	416803942	The Isis Papers: The Keys to the Colors	Books	2	68	121	N	N	Truly weird	&quot;The Isis Papers,&quot; by Frances Cress Welsing, has a back cover blurb that boasts that this book &quot;is destined to change the course of history&quot;--certainly a bold claim!  The introduction notes that this book is a collection of essays that Welsing had written over an 18 year time span.  Basically the book looks at the world and explains various symbols and sociological phenomena in the context of global white supremacy.<br />Some of Welsing's observations about the symbol structure connected to white supremacy are genuinely thought-provoking.  But overall the book seems like a strange, paranoid jumble of fake science and new age-y babble.  Welsing seems particularly obsessed with a mythic origin story of white people, whom she describes as &quot;albino mutants&quot; with &quot;defective skins&quot; (p. 123).  The book is driven by a view of whiteness as a &quot;disease&quot;--her argument can be summed up as saying that white people are evil because they're white.<br />In addition to demonizing people on the basis of their skin color, Welsing's book is also sexist.  She claims that &quot;only male muscle mass has the potential for achieving liberation&quot; (p. 83)--a claim I think is contradicted by the success of the suffragette movement!  She is also hostile towards homosexuality, claiming it to be &quot;a strategy for destroying Black people&quot; (p. 91).  Such a statement ignores the work of the many Black gay people who have been working for decades for human and civil rights.<br />Welsing seems to see penis symbols everywhere as she tries to decode the world.  At times the book really seems like a wacky conspiracy theory tract; Welsing even sees a sinister significance in the fact that &quot;God&quot; spelled backwards is &quot;dog.&quot;  Her language is sometimes vulgar, sometimes just plain weird.  A typical claim: white people &quot;have great difficulty in absorbing energy data from the universe at multiple frequencies deep energy levels&quot; (p. 175).  Basically, if you hate and fear white people and gay people, think that women are weak, and see signs of a global conspiracy everywhere you look, this book should buttress your beliefs quite effectively.  But for a critical reader, &quot;The Isis Papers&quot; is a real mess.&quot; (p. 175).  Basically, if you hate and fear white people and gay people, think that women are weak, and see signs of a global conspiracy everywhere you look, this book should buttress your beliefs quite effectively.  But for a critical reader, &quot;The Isis Papers&quot; is a real mess.	2004-03-04

Together they collaborate on travel books.  As the story begins they are moving into a new home with the help of another young couple.  Despite this positive milestone, cracks start to show in Marc and Janey's relationship.<br />This is a realistic and moving story with believable characters and situations.  The realistic, black-and-white artwork is very effective.  Norrie pays attention to visual details and makes good use of light and shadow effects.  There is a real harmony of dialogue and visuals, although some of the book's most effective parts are whole pages without dialogue.<br />&quot;Cheat&quot; is solid proof that the comic book format is an effective storytelling mode not just for sci-fi, fantasy, and action stories but also for more down-to-earth subject matter.  This is a subtly powerful story about relationships, the choices made by partners, and the effects these choices have.	2004-03-04

In his foreword Grant notes that the content of this slim volume (135 pages) was gleaned from &quot;speeches, articles, comments and conversations.&quot;  The main text is divided into 35 chapters, most not more than 3 pages long, in which Keyes looks at topics from his conservative worldview.<br />Keyes covers a lot of ground--teen drug use, abortion, Afrocentrism, the controversy over Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, welfare, capital punishment, anti-Semitism, etc.  But as a whole his perspectives lack depth.  The chapters are just too short and sketchy, and he makes too many unsupported statements.  He frequently attacks the Clinton administration, and also complains about &quot;intellectual fascists,&quot; &quot;dogmatic liberal judges,&quot; etc.  His religious references and assertions will, I imagine, appeal to Christian conservative readers.<br />A typically weak chapter is &quot;Outing the Left,&quot; where Keyes accuses Clarence Thomas opponents of &quot;anti-Catholic slurs&quot; and abortion rights supporters of &quot;religious bigotry&quot; without supporting his accusations.  Another noteworthy chapter is &quot;The Rights Rage,&quot; where he suggests that gay rights activists &quot;quit while they're ahead&quot;--remarkably bad advice in light of the mountain of gay rights advances that have been made at so many points in both the governmental and private sectors since this book's 1996 publication date!  Reading &quot;Our Character&quot; is like listening to a long diatribe by someone who keeps talking and talking and talking without really saying all that much.	2004-02-28

A short bio at the end of the book notes that Kahf was born in Damascus, Syria, came to the U.S. as a child with her family, and has attained the rank of associate professor at the University of Arkansas.<br />Kahf's poems cover a number of themes: the immigrant experience in America, cultural difference, women's issues, war, violence, and poetry itself.  There are several poems that deal with the issue of the veil traditionally worn by Muslim women.  A good representative poem is &quot;My Grandmother Washes Her Feet in the Sink of the Bathroom at Sears,&quot; a striking story of cross-cultural tension.<br />Kahf's language is passionate, sometimes witty, and always clear and accessible.  Her poems are richly spiced with many cultural references: to Wal-Mart, Robert Frost, Lt. Uhura, the &quot;Rubayat&quot; of Omar Khayyam, MTV, etc.  She is particularly searing when reflecting on living in a post-9/11 world.  Her compassionate but critical eye captures both the joy and tragedy of life.  Highly recommended for college classes, book circles, or individual reading.	2004-02-19

A glossary, bibliography, and index further add to the book's usefulness.<br />But it's the stunningly beautiful photographs that really give this book its punch.  Brown has assembled an eye-popping collection of pieces that employ many different motifs: butterflies, floral designs, fish, birds, mythological/fantasy figures, whimsical characters, fruit, patriotic motifs, abstract geometric forms, pieces reminiscent of military medals or heraldic insignia, etc.  Pictured are rhinestones of a rich variety of shapes and colors.  Every page brings new and marvelous treasures.<br />In her author's notes at the start of the book, Brown notes that she considers rhinestone jewelry to be &quot;the true 'American art form.'&quot;  Her passion for the subject really shines through in this visually pleasing compendium.	2004-02-19

But there's a twist to this detective story.  Vincent is a dinosaur--a raptor, to be specific.  He lives in a world in which dinosaurs never went extinct--instead, they evolved into human-sized intelligent beings.  The dinos live intermingled in the human population, wearing ingenious prosthetic disguises that allow them to masquerade as humans.<br />Vincent is contracted to investigate a suspicious fire, and this leads him into a twisted web of murder, deceit, sex, and weird science.  Garcia has taken a great concept and used it to create a fun, exciting story.  &quot;Anonymous&quot; has something in common with narratives like the Harry Potter saga, which similarly postulates a &quot;hidden&quot; world which coexists with our mundane human world.  Despite this common theme, however, Garcia's book is fresh and unique.<br />Garcia creates compelling characters and throws in some intriguing twists.  His writing is clever and witty, and he fleshes out this bizarre concept in a rich and satisfying way.  Along the way he tackles some &quot;real world&quot; issues such as drug abuse, forbidden sex, social control, and personal identity.  This is a wild and wondrous story that leaves me eager for a sequel.	2004-02-12

(v. 4)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Delightfully twisted	&quot;Duh: Underworld 4,&quot; by Kaz, is a collection of frequently outrageous comic strips.  Kaz populates his world with a bizarre crew of recurring characters: Shy Boy, the anally-fixated Petit Mort, tough guy Sam Snuff and his buddy Creep Rat, the Ugly Family, and more.  The humor is decidedly adult, and involves such topics as pot smoking, suicide, farting, mental illness, religion, breast size, masturbation, etc.<br />The subject matter is well complemented by the visual style, which is rich in weird details.  Kaz's characters are both grotesque and whimsical; they are repulsive yet curiously likable.  Kaz draws on such materials and motifs as fairy tales, urban life, and superhero lore.  The overall flavor of the book is like Dr. Seuss crossed with &quot;South Park,&quot; or perhaps &quot;Peanuts&quot; rewritten by taboo-busting cartoonist John Callahan.  If you love cutting edge cartooning, I strongly recommend &quot;Duh.&quot;	2004-02-12

Hinckley and has a foreword by Steve Young.  This is basically an advice book directed towards young people.  The text is structured around 9 &quot;Be's&quot;: Be Grateful, Smart, Involved, Clean, True, Positive, Humble, Still, and Prayerful.<br />Although Hinckley has risen to the position of President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (i.e. the Mormon church), the book has virtually no Mormon-specific content.  Nevertheless, the book does have a Christian-specific orientation, so while Hinckley seems to go beyond the Mormon community to embrace a Catholic and Protestant Christian readership, non-Christians may find some of the book's content to be a subtle barrier.<br />Religious orientation aside, the book does include commonsense advice.  I found the text most interesting when Hinckley, who was born in 1910, talks about his early life.  He paints a vivid and appealing portrait of his boyhood and young manhood in the early 20th century.<br />Yes, at times Hinckley sounds grouchy and ranting, and some of his advice seems vague and disconnected with contemporary events.  But overall the book is enjoyable and interesting--at times it's genuinely inspiring.	2004-02-12

The book is well organized and easy to use.  Included are three separate indexes: an extensive general index, a quick reference index, and (on the back cover) a quick thumb index.  The book covers information in many different areas: the U.S. government, world history, religion, science and technology, sports, etc.<br />The almanac is full of interesting and timely features, such as the following: a review of the top news stories of 2003; profiles of major party U.S. presidential candidates; a special section on the &quot;Baby Boom Generation&quot;; and a year in review chronology.  Internet surfers will find a treasure trove in here; the book includes Web addresses of U.S. government departments, international organizations, sports organizations, U.S. and Canadian religious groups, major U.S. business corporations, and much, much more.<br />There is also a color section with maps and pictures of the flags of the world.  Other interesting features: a glossary of computer and Internet terms; a special section on Antarctica; a sidebar article on the seven wonders of the ancient world; a list of words new to the English language; and much more.  I consider this book to be an essential reference source for work, school, home, and library.	2004-02-10

The story is narrated by a young girl who finds two old potatoes with sprouts growing from them.  With advice from her grandpa, she and her dad try to grow new potatoes from the old ones.<br />The rich, colorful pictures have a surreal flavor and an appealing energetic quality.  This is a good story about intergenerational cooperation and bonding, and also about hard work and conservation of resources.  And as a bonus the book includes a recipe for mashed potatoes.	2004-02-10

The back cover notes that the book features more than 1,000 pieces.  The emphasis is on pieces made with white metal and rhinestones.  Included in the book are some special sections on the following topics: the history of rhinestones, cuts and shapes of rhinestones, settings used to hold rhinestones, types of metal used in jewelry, and suggestions for collecting jewelry.  The bulk of the book is a price and identification guide: a huge gallery of full-color photos with descriptive text.<br />Overall, this is a beautiful and informative book, but I felt that at certain points the text needed tighter editing.  Pictured are many different types of jewelry: fur clips, brooches, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, etc.  The pieces shown employ many different styles and motifs: birds, floral designs, Art Deco designs, filigree work, butterflies, whimsical human figures, patriotic motifs, etc.  Rhinestones of different shapes, sizes, and colors are shown.  And for aspiring collectors on limited budgets, the book helpfully shows a healthy number of pieces valued at less than $50.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys looking at beautiful photographs of dazzling vintage jewelry.	2004-02-07

In a foreword, Sister Chan Khong notes that what follows is a transcription of a talk that the author gave to inmates at the Maryland Correctional Institute at Hagerstown on 16 Oct. 1999.  The text also contains a question-and-answer session and an appendix with comments by a few attendees of the talk.<br />In this book Thich Nhat Hanh talks about &quot;the energy of mindfulness,&quot; meditation, his life as a Buddhist monk, the Three Jewels of the Buddhist tradition, his own poetry, and related topics.  His words are tender, kind, and peaceful, and at times gently poetic.

Znamierowski not only covers the flags of the world's nations, but also has chapters devoted to the following topics: flags of international organizations (UN, NATO, OPEC, etc.); selected regional and local flags (provinces of Norway, prefectures of Japan, cities from around the world, etc.); flags of peoples and causes (American Indian flags, ethnic flags, revolutionary flags, etc.); and house and private flags (corporate flags, organizational flags, etc.).  The book contains full-color illustrations of flags and informative text.<br />Included in the text are interesting sidebar articles on a diverse selection of topics: the triskelion, the numerous changes in the national flag of Afghanistan, the flags of Oceania, the evolution of the Tanzanian flag, etc.  The selection of flags pictured in this book is fascinatingly diverse.  Here's a sampling of entities whose flags are depicted: the province of Simbu in Papua New Guinea; Santa Clara County, California; the City of London, England; the Solidarity movement in Poland; the Getty Oil Company; the Smithsonian Institute; and many, many more.

The introduction notes that most of the pieces pictured are on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum.  The book is divided into 3 main sections: &quot;Materials,&quot; &quot;Chronology of Style,&quot; and &quot;Manufacturing and Distribution.&quot;<br />The book includes many informative and well-illustrated spreads on a number of topics: the pendants of the Renaissance, pieces celebrating Queen Elizabeth I, 18th century paste jewelry, the Art Nouveau style, etc.  The book covers jewelry made from a rich variety of materials--gold, pearls, emeralds, cast glass, brass, coral, platinum, steel, etc.  There are even pieces made from such startling material as a real fish head or recycled bus stop signs!<br />The book portrays the work of an international gallery of artists, together with interesting biographical facts about these creators.  Among the many designers included are Gijs Bakker of Holland, Wendy Ramshaw of England, Fritz Maierhofer of Austria, Yasuki Hiramatsu of Japan, and more.  Some really unforgettable creations are pictured, ranging from elegant pieces with a traditional flavor to futuristic or quirky pieces.  Overall, a superb book that truly celebrates the tremendous imagination and skill of the world's jewelry makers.	2004-02-03

From there the story moves back and forth in time, covering the narrator's childhood in Iran, her adulthood and marriage, and more.<br />This is a wonderful book that made me laugh at loud at times.  But it's also touching and inspirational.  Dumas' narrative follows a colorful and likeable cast of characters, most notably her father Kazem: a hardworking engineer determined to live his own version of the American dream.  Dumas' prose is clear, engaging, and quite witty.  She writes with a contagious affection for her Iranian culture, the United States, and her family.<br />Although the book is often very humorous, Dumas also effectively covers some serious topics--the language barrier, religious controversy, female body image, the impact of the Iranian hostage crisis, etc.  And along the way we get a spicy taste of Iranian culture and tradition.  Overall, this is a superb addition to the canon of literature that explores the rich and complex topic of ethnicity in the U.S; it's a book well suited for college courses, reading groups, and individual pleasure reading.  As a companion text, I strongly recommend &quot;A World Between: Poems, Short Stories, and Essays by Iranian Americans,&quot; edited by Persis M. Karim and Mohammad Mehdi Khorrami.	2004-01-31

Looking at the world around us, the book has a scope that ranges from the inner structure of an atom to the shapes of galaxies.  The cover boasts that the dictionary contains 6,000 color entries and 35,000 terms.  The items pictured include pure symbols, tangible man-made items, natural objects and living entities. At more than 900 pages long, the book is a hefty achievement.<br />This book is divided up into 17 chapters: Astronomy, Earth, Vegetable Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, Human Being, Food and Kitchen, House, Do-It-Yourself and Gardening, Clothing, Personal Adornment and Articles, Arts and Architecture, Communications and Office Automation, Transport and Machinery, Energy, Science, Society, and Sports and Games.  An index is included.<br />Yes, I'm sure people could complain about things that are left out or not covered in great enough detail, but overall this book is ambitious and comprehensive.  If I could only give one book to an extraterrestrial visitor to help him/her/it become oriented to Earth, this would be it.  Among the specific things covered are types of mushrooms, the inner parts of a toilet bowl, the anatomy of an umbrella, the structure of a Greek temple, the flags of the world, major North American road signs, the parts of a volleyball court, and much, much, more.  This is one reference work which is not only informative and well organized, but a genuine work of art.	2004-01-29

Once again our principal characters are a young man named Shin and &quot;Lefty,&quot; the intelligent, shapeshifting, parasitic life form that has taken the place of Shin's left arm.<br />Like book 1, this graphic novel is an effective blend of science fiction, horror, and human drama.  The parasyte plague continues, and takes a horrifying turn for Shin.  The Shin/Lefty relationship is more deeply explored, and takes a truly startling twist.  We learn more about parasyte biology and the parasyte/host relationship in general, but the underlying mystery that undergirded book 1 remains.  The visual style remains potent.  If you loved book 1, I highly recommend this well-written continuation.	2004-01-22

This book is stunningly beautiful--it's full of detailed, full-color photographs that are accompanied by a well-written and informative text.  Many different types of jewelry are depicted in these 256 pages--earrings, necklaces, bracelets, cufflinks, pins, etc.<br />The book is full of fascinating and useful features: profiles of major designers (Chanel, Christian Dior, Hattie Carnegie, etc.), a glossary, a section depicting designers' stamps and copyright marks, reproductions of vintage magazine advertisements, and more.  The international directory of dealers, auction houses, and museums includes addresses, phone numbers, Web sites, fax numbers, and/or e-mail addresses.  There are sections highlighting interesting trends: suffragette jewelry, cut steel jewelry, etc.<br />The book is full of intriguing sidebars about many different topics: the manufacture of faux pearls, the Surrealist influence on designer Elsa Schiaparelli, etc.  There are also a number of spreads on &quot;Hot Collecting Fields,&quot; such as Austrian crystal fruit pins and Bakelite jewelry; I was especially impressed by the 4-page spread on Scottish agate jewelry.<br />The book really covers a broad range of costume jewelry.  Many different styles are depicted.  The jewelry covered also represents a large range of materials--Berlin ironwork, Whitby jet, rhinestones, aluminum, poured glass, Lucite, rhodoid, copper, wood, faux coral, and more.  I also like the fact that a broad price range is covered.  There are many pieces that are under $50, as well as many that are over $1,000.

The &quot;About the Author&quot; section at the end of the book notes that Cisneros was born in Chicago, the daughter of a Mexican father and a Mexican-American mother.  Cisneros tells Esperanza's story in a series of 44 short vignettes.<br />Cisneros' writing is really beautiful--full of wonderfully vivid imagery.  Many of the short chapters are less than a full page in length and read like prose poems.  Along the way we learn of Esperanza's family, neighbors, school, rites of passage, and dreams of the future.  Cisneros writes with a moving appreciation of beauty, hope, and tragedy; &quot;Mango Street&quot; is a richly realized world.	2004-01-19

Mandelbaum breaks this vast collection of flops into a number of categories--star flops, flops based on movies, &quot;missed opportunities,&quot; etc.  One particularly intriguing section of the book is Chapter 5, &quot;Don't Let This Happen to You&quot;; here the author gives a list of rules to follow in order to avoid creating a flop.  Example, rule #9: &quot;Don't do sequels&quot; (such as &quot;Annie 2&quot;).<br />Mandelbaum's prose is clear, authoritative, and often appropriately biting.  Many accounts of flops stand out as particularly fascinating--Peter Allen's disastrous &quot;Legs Allen,&quot; the aforementioned &quot;Annie 2,&quot; etc.  The book is full of black-and-white photographs--playbill covers, shots of the performers, promotional art.  This gives the book great visual appeal.  Some of the musicals described are almost too bizarre to be believed (such as &quot;Into the Light,&quot; a show about the Shroud of Turin).<br />Mandelbaum opens and closes the book with spellbinding in-depth sections on &quot;Carrie&quot; the musical, complete with photos.  This helps give the book as a whole a satisfying structure.  Indeed, &quot;Not Since Carrie&quot; ultimately reads like a vast multigenerational epic--at times funny, absurd, and/or tragic.	2004-01-18

The title page notes that the text is &quot;as published in The New York Review of Books of January 16, 2003.&quot;  The copyright page notes further that the book is based on a lecture given by the author at the New York Public Library on Nov. 13, 2002.  It's a short book (44 plus xiv pages).<br />The book is an attempt to look critically at the &quot;national pieties,&quot; or fixed opinions that seem to have gripped the U.S. national psyche since the terrorist attacks of 2001.  Didion discusses the &quot;death of irony,&quot; conflicting ideas and attitudes since 9/11, the &quot;New American Unilateralism,&quot; etc.  She also tries to put &quot;the inevitability of going to war with Iraq&quot; in historical context.<br />Didion's intentions strike me as admirable, but in the end I found the book to be lacking in profound new insight.  Although she raises some intriguing issues, the text is oddly inert and ends abruptly.  Still, it's worth reading if you're interested in the cultural debates spawned in the aftermath of 9/11.	2004-01-18
831967:US	51987970	R1N7TGKM5QKPXV	0393051951	965795651	Call Me Ishmael Tonight: A Book of Ghazals	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Poetry at the crossroads of cultures	&quot;Call Me Ishmael Tonight: A Book of Ghazals,&quot; by Agha Shahid Ali, is a truly distinctive addition to American poetry.  The &quot;About the Author&quot; section notes that Ali was a Kashmiri-American who was born in New Delhi and held a number of academic posts in the U.S. before his death in 2001.  A short note on the ghazal briefly describes the history and structure of this poetic form.<br />Each ghazal is made up of a series of couplets.  In general the second line of each couplet repeats a rhyme and refrain (with the first couplet of the series using this rhyme and refrain in both lines).  For example, the poem &quot;By Exiles&quot; ends three sample lines &quot;...torn wild by exiles,&quot; &quot;...compiled by exiles,&quot; and &quot;...beguiled by exiles.&quot;  At first I found the book hard to warm too.  The ghazal structure itself struck me as distracting; the form seemed to call too much attention to itself and to overwhelm the content.  But I found repeated readings to be rewarding and illuminating.<br />Ali has a vision with a remarkable multicultural sweep.  Woven into the ghazals are many references--Lorca, Oscar Wilde, &quot;The Satanic Verses,&quot; Apollo, Pocahontas, Bartleby, Borges, etc.  There is a lot of religious material in the poems also, at times making it feel like some boldly contemporary scripture.  Other important themes are death, loss, and language.<br />At times the book has an irreverent or satiric flavor.  It is filled with some astonishing imagery.  Ultimately &quot;Call Me Ishmael&quot; reads like a meeting place of cultures.  At times hypnotic, surreal, apocalyptic, chaotic, ironic, cryptic, and tragic, it's a work of haunting beauty.	2004-01-11

Africa Lives in a New World Festival,&quot; by Sule Greg C. Wilson, is an informative book about the African-American celebration of the title.  The text is supplemented by a wealth of photographs.  The book covers African-American history, the Swahili language, the origin of Kwanzaa, the 7 principles of Kwanzaa, and the items used in the Kwanzaa ceremony.  The book includes a number of useful features: a glossary, a list of Web sites, a bibliography, and an index.<br />The book is, however, hurt by an often uncritically naive slant.  At times the author seems to treat African culture as an artificial monolith, using phrases like &quot;According to African principles...&quot; or &quot;African culture teaches us....&quot;  Casually referring to &quot;Ebonics&quot; glosses over a complex and controversial linguistic issue.  And the book's presentation of the slave era is unbalanced; the author discusses &quot;the Europeans&quot; as if they were a monolithically evil group.  In the end, these questionable authorial choices damage the book's credibility.	2004-01-06

This seven-chapter story is about Steeljack, a metal-encased supervillain.  Released from prison at the book's start, he is hired by a criminal kingpin to find out who is murdering other supervillains.<br />This is a powerful, rich, complex story.  Steeljack's tale is intertwined with that of a number of other fantastic characters: whip-wielding Latino superhero El Hombre, high-tech British supervillain the Mock Turtle, and more.  Many characters from the other Astro City volumes (Samaritan, Winged Victory, etc.) also make appearances.<br />Sort of a world-weary loser, Steeljack is a compelling, memorable protagonist.  &quot;Tarnished Angel&quot; is full of great visuals, heroic battles, and moving human drama.  The book as a whole is a fascinating look at the Astro City milieu from its dark side.	2004-01-06

Written by Chris Claremont and Brent Eric Anderson, the book is lettered by Tom Orzechowski and colored by Steve Oliff.  In this science fiction adventure, the superheroic mutants known as the X-Men face a complex struggle against William Stryker, a powerful televangelist who is masterminding an ominous plot.  Complicating this conflict is the presence of Magneto, the mutant whose own agenda is at odds with those of both Stryker and the X-Men.<br />This X-Men adventure features Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Colossus, Ariel, and Nightcrawler.  This is an excellent story which, in my opinion, captures the essence of the X-men mythos.  &quot;God Loves&quot; is a thrilling mix of action, interpersonal drama, and philosophy.  The authors effectively develop the core idea of the mutants as a misunderstood and persecuted minority.  There are some really heart-tugging scenes--these are characters you can really care about.  The artists deliver some unforgettable visuals.<br />Stryker is a truly monstrous, horrifying figure.  But his effectiveness is a character lies in the fact that he is so similar to many real-live Religious Right figures.  Stryker is a Bible-quoting preacher who uses his vast wealth and political influence to wage a campaign of hate against a particular minority group.  With a copyright date of 1982, &quot;God Loves&quot; strikes me as eerily prophetic, and still chillingly relevant.<br />The plot of &quot;God Loves&quot; is similar in certain aspects to that of the 2003 film &quot;X2&quot;--I don't think it's any accident that the mutant-hating villains in these stories have the same name.  But despite the parallels &quot;God Loves&quot; still stands on its own as a powerful, well-written X-Men story.  I consider it one of the essential masterpieces in the graphic novel genre.	2003-12-30

Huey and Riley Freeman are two young African-American boys who have moved from Chicago to a nearly all-white neighborhood with their grandfather.  McGruder mines the saga of these strangers in a strange land for some potent humor and cutting social satire.<br />McGruder has developed some of the best comic strip characters I have ever read: Huey, a pint-sized revolutionary and conspiracy theorist with a huge afro; gangsta wannabe Riley; their crochety grandfather; Jazmine, a mixed-race neighbor girl at odds with her ethnic heritage; &quot;Psycho 'Star Wars' Guy&quot;; and more.  Typical plots involve Huey starting a neighborhood Klanwatch, delving into the &quot;Santa Conspiracy,&quot; etc.  Along the way there are jokes and slams involving Star Wars, UPN, and BET.<br />&quot;The Boondocks&quot; is a comic strip with both brains and heart--unafraid to be controversial, but also unashamed to explore the humanity of its characters.  Is it a &quot;Peanuts&quot; for the 21st century?  I don't know, but I do know it's good stuff.	2003-12-30

The book is full of drawings and informative text.  Spears, sabers, tridents, shields, and other types of offensive and defensive devices are covered.<br />In addition to discussing more familiar types of weapons, the book depicts such bizarre looking devices as the Wolf Brush, the Iron Claw and the Flying Claw.  There are also weapons with such evocative names as the Heaven-Earth Sun-Moon Saber and the Zi Wu Mandarin Duck Axe.  Particularly interesting is the coverage of non-weapons that evolved into weapons, such as cymbals or chopsticks.  The book is clearly written, logically organized, and visually appealing.	2003-12-23

Among the topics covered are the military campaign in Afghanistan, the anthrax scare, and the phenomenon of suicide bombing.  The tone is satirical, with a very harsh edge.<br />I found the book sometimes clever, but sometimes it is just unfunny ranting.  Much of the humor comes from the pairing of banal white collar images with the often over-the-top, profanity laden dialogue.	2003-12-23

In his foreword Keene notes that &quot;Oda is a prominent, if controversial figure in the Japanese literary world.&quot;  This novel takes place on a South Pacific island during World War II and follows the experiences of a Japanese military unit.<br />The story focuses in particular on two characters: Sergeant Nakamura, a tough, tested leader; and Corporal Kon, an ethnic Korean serving in the Japanese military.  Through the experiences of these and other characters Oda vividly dramatizes the suffering of soldiers in wartime.  The book is filled with harsh, gory details.  Among the issues touched on are the psychology of war, military tactics and soldierly ethics.  In the character of Kon, Oda has a vehicle for an intriguing exploration of ethnic identity.  Being a U.S. citizen, I was fascinated to read a book that looked at WW2 from a Japanese perspective; I consider &quot;Jewel&quot; to be a moving and valuable contribution to world literature.	2003-12-12

Forrest, tells the story of a collective of women who leave Earth to start an all-female society on the distant planet which they name Maternas.  The book is a blend of science fiction and lesbian romance novel.  Although hokey at times, it's an enjoyable book that has some effective touches of light humor.<br />One aspect of the book that rings false is Forrest's vision of a future Earth gripped by sexism and institutional anti-lesbianism.  It seems absurd that humanity could evolve to the point of having interstellar travel and still be crippled by such societal backwardness.  But the book does have a copyright date of 1984, so this skewed look at the future may just reflect the reality of the time it was written.<br />At times the romance aspect of the book is a bit too flowery for my taste.  But the sweep of Forrest's overall vision really carries the tale.  There are moments of real excitement and passages of genuine poetic beauty.  &quot;Daughters&quot; is a worthy addition to that canon of sci-fi novels that explore human gender and sexuality (such as LeGuin's &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; and Sturgeon's &quot;Venus Plus X&quot;).	2003-12-09

The Keeper is a stern-looking woman who keeps letters trapped in a cage.  Each letter is sort of a little creature with a mind of its own.  After the letters escape, they lead the Keeper on a wild chase as she attempts to catch them.<br />This entertaining chase is full of clever word tricks--for example, when the Keeper uses a bus to pursue the letters, the letter &quot;h&quot; flies down and turns the &quot;bus&quot; into a &quot;bush.&quot;  Many more such gags follow.  This wacky story is well complemented by the cartoony illustrations.  Overall, a fun way to help teach kids about letters and how they form words.	2003-11-24

The bulk of the book consists of country-by-country entries.  Each entry includes a full color illustration of the national flag along with text detailing the history and symbolic significance of each flag.  The individual entries also contain various other visuals, such as national coats-of-arms, presidential flags, etc.<br />Other features of the book are sections explaining the parts of a flag and various flag terminology.  Particularly fascinating is the large number of subnational flags that are depicted and explained in the book.  Among these are the flags of Canadian provinces, U.S. states, French overseas territories, Spanish regions, Russian republics, and Malaysian states.  I found many of these subnational flags really visually striking--from the fairy-tale like elements of the Swiss canton flags to the bold colors and geometric designs of the Brazilian state flags, and beyond.  There is also section on the flags of international organizations such as the Arab League and the United Nations.<br />My only complaint about this fine book is that the descriptive text around the pictures of many of the national flags has lines pointing from the text onto the drawing, unnecessarily marring the illustrations.  This descriptive text would have been just as effective without these distracting lines.  That complaint aside, this book is a richly informative and visually exciting reference work--it's a book you can turn to again and again.	2003-11-20

The boys are odd outsiders with curious webbed toes and fingers.<br />Ultimately, the three kids go on a journey of self-discovery.  These are three likeable, interesting characters and Hoffman tells their story with a simple, clean prose style that is very effective.

These parasyte/human unions spread a trail of murder.  The story centers on Shin, a high school student whose parasyte fails to take over his brain and his will; instead, the creature takes over his left arm.  Shin and &quot;Lefty&quot; soon develop a curious symbiotic relationship.<br />The crisp black-and-white artwork is an effective medium for telling this story.  The book is full of inventive, at times stunning, visuals.  Awaaki maintains mystery and tension throughout the story, and throws in some mind-blowing surprises.  Shin and &quot;Lefty&quot; have a truly intriguing relationship, and it's complicated by their encounters with other parasytes; this character-driven element is one of the story's key strengths.<br />&quot;Parasyte&quot; is at times extremely gory and bloody.  Overall, it's a well-written and imaginative blend of horror, science fiction, and teen angst.	2003-11-16

As a whole this is an absolutely fascinating and illuminating collection of voices.  Among the many topics covered are Quranic interpretation, Muslim humor, the roles played by mosques in America, fasting, Sufism, the impact of the 9/11 attacks, and sectarianism within Islam.  It's not a sanitized book--the essays cover some difficult and controversial material.<br />There are some real standout pieces in this anthology.  Mas'ood Cajee's &quot;'Mom Raised Me as a Zionist'&quot; is a funny and touching account of growing up in both South Africa and the U.S. and of his encounters with the Jewish community.  Arsalan Tariq Iftikhar's &quot;I Believe in Allah and America&quot; is a genuinely stirring piece in which the author declares, &quot;I am a Muslim and I am an American.  I am proud of both and will compromise neither.&quot;<br />This is a thought provoking and valuable book which I especially recommend to Americans regardless of their religious beliefs.  It's a book suitable for both classroom use and individual reading.	2003-11-15

Grounded in evangelical/fundamentalist Christian theology, the book continues the story of a group of young people living in an apocalyptic near future.  The book's heroes continue their resistance mission while world leader Nicolae Carpathia continues to consolidate his new world order.<br />&quot;Busted!&quot; shows some of the flaws of the other books in the series.  The dialogue is stiff and corny; many characters and scenes seem a bit forced.  A significant theme of this story is the conversion of Jews to fundamentalist Christianity.  I found the tone of the Jewish-related material in the book to be patronizing and paternalistic.  Still, the story held my interest and did contain some intriguing elements.  In some ways, it's like a good old fashioned dystopian sci-fi tale.	2003-11-15

But the centerpiece of this book is her marvelous body of poetry.  Publication data is given for each poem; included are a number of previously unpublished pieces.  Johnson was a true technical master of poetry, skilled at using rhyme, meter, and alliteration.  She is as effective with a sonnet as with free verse.<br />Her work is passionate, witty, and bold.  She is a keen observer and has some poems that really appeal to the senses.  She is adept with vernacular language, as well as with more traditionally literary language.  These poems cover an impressive range of subject matter: nature, religion, oppression, Black pride, urban life, war, growing old, etc.<br />I fell in love with Johnson's amazing voice years ago when I encountered her work in an anthology.  I am glad to see a volume devoted to her legacy;  I highly recommend this book for individual reading, classroom use, and book clubs.	2003-10-14

Billy and Alan make a bet that Billy cannot eat 15 worms in 15 days.  Tom acts as Billy's \\"second\\" in the bet, with Joe acting as Alan's.<br />Rockwell's set-up for the story is inspired in its simplicity, and he tells the tale with gusto.  The contest turns into an all-out battle of wits and wills between the two teams--it's a sort of mini-epic whose plot contains some entertaining twists.<br />It's also a great \\"gross-out\\" story, and Rockwell's characters really put their culinary imaginations to use as Billy attempts to achieve his goal.  A hugely enjoyable comic tale that I recommend to readers of all ages.	2003-10-09

Written by Conan O'Brien and the writers of his \\"Late Night\\" TV show, the book is often laugh-out-loud funny.<br />Conan and crew cover a lot of topics with these humorous \\"prophecies\\": technological advances, world politics, encounters with extraterrestrial life, changes in the vernacular language, etc.  Many different celebrities are satirically skewered: Jodie Foster, the Pope, Bill Clinton, the Dalai Lama, Gerald Ford, Kathie Lee Gifford, etc, etc.--Conan and crew prove themselves truly bipartisan, equal opportunity mockers.<br />If you enjoy Conan's TV routine of the same name, I predict that you will enjoy this book.  It's scathing, raunchy, witty, surreal, and a lot of fun.	2003-10-09

Kit experiences quite a bit of culture shock.  A key figure in the story is Hannah Tupper, an elderly neighbor suspected of witchcraft.<br />This is a fascinating story, well told by Speare.  The strong-willed Kit is an admirable character, and I really got caught up in her story.  Speare offers an intriguing look at colonial era life and culture--the book is full of interesting details and thoughtful touches, such as a reference to colonial-era poet Anne Bradstreet.<br />In a relatively short novel Speare touches on a rich assortment of colonial-era topics: religious difference, anti-Quaker bigotry, politics, education, fears of witchcraft, etc.  All these things are skillfully woven into the compelling story.  And Speare vividly describes the natural beauty of colonial Connecticut with the changing seasons.<br />The book has a copyright date of 1958, so I would say that it has stood the test of time as a literary work.  It's also a Newbery Medal winner.  For a good companion text I would recommend a volume of Anne Bradstreet's poems.	2003-08-02

She is a Cuban-American woman in her 30s.  She's tough, resourceful, daring, and sometimes a little lusty.  The author bio inside the back cover notes that Garcia-Aguilera was born in Cuba, and like her heroine worked as a licensed private detective in Miami.<br />In this story Lupe becomes involved in two cases involving valuable works of art.  Along the way she faces personal danger, deceit and murder.  This is a fast-moving, colorful, and sometimes funny tale.  The international intrigue and adventure often give the book a sort of James Bond feel--in fact, I could imagine agent 007 finding a worthy partner in Lupe if one of his assignments ever brought him to Miami.<br />The author does a particularly effective job in illuminating the practical, nuts-and-bolts aspects of Lupe's detective technique.  The book is not only an exciting detective thriller--it also is very much about Cuban-American history, politics, and identity.  As an &quot;ethnic&quot; American detective, Lupe could be seen as sort of a soul sister to Harry Kemelman's Rabbi Small.  But whether you look at this book as a straightforward mystery or as part of the tradition of ethnic American literature, I think that &quot;Havana Heat&quot; is a winner.	2003-07-30

Kinsey is hired by Nikki Fife, a woman who had been sent to prison after being convicted of murdering her husband.  Nikki maintains her innocence and wants Kinsey to find the real killer--eight years after the murder.  This assignment leads to deceit and danger for the sleuth.<br />This is a suspenseful, intriguing murder mystery.  Grafton has an eye for detail and a gift for creating characters.  Kinsey is an especially memorable detective.  She's tough and no-nonsense, but still has her vulnerable points.  She's smart, but not a superwoman; rather, a believable, down-to-earth heroine.<br />The matter-of-fact narration is very effective.  We get insights into Kinsey's detection technique along the way.  This is a story of murder, sex, greed, and deception, well told by Grafton.	2003-07-29

A few of the highlights: the hilarious &quot;A Public Apology,&quot; in which Martin confesses to some heinous activities.  &quot;Dear Amanda&quot;: an ironic short tale in the form of letters.  &quot;Times Roman Font Announces Shortage of Periods&quot;: an absurd, surreal account of a writerly nightmare.  &quot;Hissy Fit&quot;: the tale of a New York writer's ordeal in Los Angeles.  &quot;The Y3K Bug&quot;: a whimsical science fiction tale set about 1,000 years in the future.  And the delightful &quot;A Word from the Words,&quot; in which one of the words in the book directly addresses the reader.<br />Having seen many of Martin's performances and appearances over the years, I could really imagine him delivering some of these pieces as monologues in his dry, witty way.  The book as a whole is inventive and brainy; Martin does an imaginative job of mixing high- and pop culture forms.  A fun read.	2003-07-28
1032060:US	51987970	R1OWW27NLLW8FW	080411935X	668262969	Standing in the Rainbow	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Flagg's American quilt	&quot;Standing in the Rainbow,&quot; by Fannie Flagg, is a novel that seems to me like a literary version of a patchwork quilt: Flagg takes a colorful bunch of stories and weaves them together into a warm and comforting whole.  The novel tells the stories of a number of generations of folk living in Elmwood Springs, Missouri.  The book begins in the 1940s and takes us through several more decades.<br />Flagg deals with a lot of issues in this 500-plus page (in the paperback version) book: love, marriage, parenthood, loss, death, growing up, growing old, cultural difference, etc.  Particularly juicy is her storytelling about American popular culture and politics.  In the interlocking tales of these people she deals with a wide span of human relationships: mother/daughter, brother/sister, husband/wife, grandparent/grandchild, friends, political rivals, etc.<br />The book is full of likeable and colorful characters, some of whom have surprising twists in their life journeys.  Flagg is adept at showing how people live their lives in the midst of societal change; I also admire her skill at showing how ordinary folk can have revelatory moments in their lives.<br />&quot;Standing&quot; is a big, lively, likeable novel.  Although a number of sections could almost stand alone as independent short stories, they ultimately contribute to Flagg's larger story--the story not of one person, or of one family, but of an entire community and more.  Although there is sadness along the way, it's a hopeful and positive book.  Flagg writes with grace, humor, and--above all--compassion for her characters.	2003-07-28

The back cover info notes that the play ran in Paris beginning in October 1994 and received its British premiere in 1996.<br />This 3 character play is about a trio of friends: Marc, Serge, and Yvan.  As the play starts Serge has infuriated Marc by buying an all white painting for a huge price.  Yvan gets caught in the middle as the three argue over art, the role of the artist, being &quot;modern,&quot; personal identity, and relationships.<br />This description of the play may make it sound a bit like a &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode.  It's an intriguing and witty play.  I've never seen it performed, but because it seems to rely so heavily on the presence of a central prop, &quot;Art&quot; may lose some impact as a pure readers' text (not unlike the situation with August Wilson's play &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot;).  Ultimately the drama builds to a powerful conclusion.  It's a thought-provoking play; I especially recommend it to those who wonder about the nature of art and its role in our world today.	2003-07-28
1033173:US	51987970	R12HIJ47A9M2E0	0375718850	390785003	Ash Wednesday	Books	5	4	7	N	N	On the road across the U.S.	&quot;Ash Wednesday,&quot; by Ethan Hawke, is a novel about a young couple: soldier James Heartsock and his pregnant girlfriend Christy.  They go on a journey that takes them from Albany to New York City, to Ohio, and to other places in the United States.  But this young couple is on an emotional journey as well as a physical one.<br />The talented Hawke has really impressed me with his work in film (particularly his stunning performance in the film &quot;Training Day&quot;), and with this novel he proves his talent as an American storyteller.  Hawke had me gripped from his powerful opening chapter, in which Heartsock has to perform a difficult military task.  Hawke's writing is marked by vivid descriptive language and intriguing characters--a number of his minor characters have almost mythic qualities.<br />&quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; is a story of family ties and disruptions.  A key theme of the book is growing up and making the transition to adulthood, and accepting the responsibilities that go along with this transition.  Along the way Hawke raises a number of religious and spiritual issues.  He deals with such issues as faith, ritual and grace; he seems to be asking if they are still relevant today--whether they can still bring meaning and joy to life.  This is a thoughtful and moving novel.	2003-07-27

Books	4	2	2	N	N	Advice for your inner warrior	Paul Coelho's &quot;Warrior of the Light: A Manual&quot; has been translated from Portuguese by Margaret Jull Costa.  The copyright page notes that the book was first published in Brazil in 1997, and an author's note notes that most of the material in the book was first published in a newspaper column.<br />&quot;Warrior&quot; is a guide to living a balanced and meaningful life.  The text takes the form of a series of inspirational verses bracketed by a parable-like story.  Coelho's approach is interfaith and multicultural: along the way he cites the I Ching, John Bunyan, Lao Tzu, Jesus, Gandhi, Arabic proverbs, and others.  God is often mentioned, but not in a religion-specific sense.  Along the way such topics as faith, meditation and prayer are dealt with.<br />Quite a bit of the book seems rather obvious and feels like I've read it before; at times the tone is a bit too &quot;New Age-y&quot; for my tastes.  But there are also some really thoughtful and striking passages, and a welcome touch of wit.  The book is sometimes paradoxical.  &quot;Warrior&quot; is a contemporary text that reminds me of the tradition of the Dhammapada, Marcus Aurelius' &quot;Meditations,&quot; and other such spiritual/instructional texts.  It's a hopeful and generous-spirited book.	2003-07-27
1038165:US	51987970	R4X45VXS1WCG2	0375706712	368464953	Aye, and Gomorrah: And Other Stories	Books	5	11	11	N	N	A near-perfect fusion of artistry and imagination	&quot;Aye, and Gomorrah and Other Stories,&quot; by Samuel R. Delany, brings together 15 tales along with an afterword by the author.  The copyright page gives the publication histories of the pieces in this book.  The stories in this volume vary greatly in length: 2 fall into the 60-70 page range (and could, I suppose, be considered novellas), 2 fall into the less than 10 page range, and the rest are of various lengths in between;  this nicely adds to the overall variety of the collection.<br />Most of the pieces in this book fall firmly in the science fiction genre, although I consider a couple to be fantasy.  Delany's locales range from cities on Earth (Venice, New York) to worlds beyond our solar system.<br />Delany's stories are both triumphs of science fiction inventiveness and exquisite works of literary art--as well as being compassionate yet unflinching explorations of the human condition.  His vision is richly ironic, and often tragic.  His prose can be hauntingly beautiful to read--he is a particular master of visual description.<br />Delany's explorations of emergent subcultures and institutions in many of these tales give the book an intriguing sociological aspect.  His topics include crime, punishment, sexuality, loss, suffering, culture clash, space travel, and the fabric of consciousness and reality.<br />The remarkable title story is a look at the emergence of a new sexual orientation and its related subculture in the context of expanding technology.  &quot;Driftglass&quot; looks at a class of physiologically altered humans.  &quot;Omegahelm&quot; is a shocking, fascinating story about motherhood and art.  These are just a few examples of Delany's fertile mind.  I consider Delany to be a unique and essential voice in the science fiction canon; this collection of his short fiction is a volume to be savored and shared.	2003-07-23

The poems in this volume demonstrate Poe's total mastery of poetic effects: rhyme, meter, alliteration, etc.  He is inventive and versatile in his use of different poetic structures.  The many allusions mark this as the work of a truly brainy poet.<br />But it's not just his skill and intelligence that are characteristic of Poe.  He is also a poet of deeply felt passions.  This collection shows his appreciation of love and beauty, as well as his concern with loss and tragedy.<br />I'll just mention a few of the selections that struck me most.  &quot;Sonnet--To Science&quot;: brilliantly expresses the tension between scientific and mythopoetic worldviews.  &quot;The Coliseum&quot;: a thrilling exploration of the power of ancient ruins.  &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot;: the rich language contributes to its fairy-tale like flavor.  &quot;To My Mother&quot;: an achingly tender tribute to the speaker's mother-in-law.  &quot;Annabel Lee&quot;: a hauntingly beautiful, yet disturbingly creepy poem of love and loss.  And of course, the unforgettable title poem.<br />Dive into Poe's poetry and you enter a realm haunted by both angels and demons--a world of sorrow and joy, of terror and intoxicating beauty.	2003-07-23

Nothing is sacred when Carlin gets going.  He mines humor from such topics as religion, ethnic pride, AIDS, the Columbine shootings, Jeffrey Dahmer, plane crashes, cancer, capital punishment, and much more.<br />The book contains &quot;Short Takes&quot; (pieces not more than a few sentences long) and longer routines.  Among the pieces are a merciless denunciation of golf and Tiger Woods, a program for an avant-garde play, &quot;The 20th Century World Hostility Scoreboard,&quot; and a look at &quot;The Humorous Side of Rape.&quot;  Particularly scathing is his critique of the first Persian Gulf war.<br />Carlin reads like an angry, foul-mouthed prophet who is intent on mercilessly exposing the stupidity and hypocrisy of American society.  He is often at his best when deconstructing the Orwellian language we use to enslave our own minds.  He really lives up to his creed: &quot;I believe you can joke about anything.&quot;  So brace yourself and dive into this politically incorrect (in so many ways!) tirade.	2003-07-22
1042034:US	51987970	R12N9LE5LQFXPT	0880014792	18687637	Essential Whitman (Essential Poets)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Whitman via Kinnell	&quot;The Essential Whitman&quot; consists of the poetry of Walt Whitman as selected by Galway Kinnell, who also provides an introduction.  In his intro Kinnell notes that Whitman continually revised his great poetry, but not always, in Kinnell's opinion, for the better.  Kinnell further notes that the versions of the poems in this book incorporate the best aspects of Whitman's many versions.  He writes, &quot;Some of the poems in this book, therefore, are in versions that have never existed before.&quot;  Notes at the end of the collection show what versions were incorporated into the poems as reconstituted by Kinnell.<br />I'm not enough of a Whitman scholar to thoroughly critique Kinnell's technique and choices.  But I do find his approach fascinating, and I enjoyed the poetry for what it is.<br />The poetry in this book is an expansive, passionate testament with the flavor of prophecy--the prophecy, that is, of a playful and joyous heretic.  Whitman shows a compassion for and identification with all human beings, regardless of race, gender, or religion.  He is a great forerunner of 20th and 21st century multiculturalism, and shows a sympathy with the suffering and the oppressed.<br />His vision moves from the intimacy of a blade of grass to the movement of the stars; his eye takes in all of human history and prehistory.  His writing is marked by delicious irony and paradox; he is bold enough to say &quot;let one line of my poems contradict another!&quot;  At times the poetry seems to reflect the experience of an altered state of consciousness.  Whitman's &quot;barbaric yawp&quot; is one of the essential voices of American poetry, and Kinnell has put together a marvelous sampling of that voice.	2003-07-20

I'm a Mind Reader,&quot; by Dan Greenburg, is #4 in the &quot;Zack Files&quot; series of paranormal tales for young readers.  The book is illustrated by Jack E. Davis.  The series as a whole follows the adventures of New York City schoolboy Zack.  In this installment he gains the ability to read minds after receiving an electrical shock.  But when Zack begins to telepathically receive some very frightening messages, he begins to fear that his life is in danger.<br />I found &quot;Zap!&quot; to be darker and scarier than many of the other Zack episodes.  The book is enlivened further by the series' characteristic humor.  Illustrator Davis does some particularly good character work in this volume.  Overall, a suspenseful and enjoyable horror-mystery with a satisfying payoff.	2003-07-17

Dana Gould is credited as editor of this book, which is basically a short study guide to the New Testament epistle of Paul to the Ephesians.  The book includes a supplement on the life and ministry of Paul, a map of Paul's world, a 2-page bibliography, and pages at the end of the book in which the reader can write his or her own notes.  The text is enlivened by sidebar notes with icon keys.<br />The &quot;How to Use This Book&quot; section boasts that this volume should make study of Ephesians &quot;time-saving,&quot; &quot;easy,&quot; &quot;quick,&quot; etc.  And that may be part of the problem of this book; it oversimplifies many of the complex issues that I feel surround this text.  Rather than challenge the reader to struggle with complexity and ambiguity, this book spoon-feeds the reader predigested mush.<br />Although there is some interesting information along the way, much of the text feels like I've seen or heard it dozens of times before.  At times the book is painfully obvious. Example: &quot;Shoes are important to the foot soldier.&quot;<br />The author goes for the easiest and most literal interpretations regarding such complex issues as slavery and husband-wife relationships.  I found the section on slavery particularly shallow; the book really glosses over an issue of biblical interpretation that challenged the Christian world for a long and divisive time.  Overall, a disappointing book.  For a better perspective on Christianity and slavery in particular, I recommend two essential primary texts: &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; and Harriet Jacobs' &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.&quot;	2003-07-17

In the introduction the Comptons describe this compilation of church signs as &quot;a soulful slice of roadside Americana.&quot;<br />The messages include invitations, threats, puns, political comments, satire, and advice.  There are musings on God, the devil, the Bible, prayer, and other topics.  Along the way are a number of cultural references.<br />A number of the signs have an unpleasant flavor of arrogance or intolerance.  Examples: &quot;God said it, I believe it, that settles it&quot;; &quot;April First: National Atheists Day&quot;; &quot;Turn or burn&quot;; etc.  Some of the messages hint at a larger cultural war between Christian fundamentalists and secular society; this aspect of the book is particularly intriguing.<br />But culture wars aside, there are some delightful and thoughtful entries along the way.  A couple of my favorites: &quot;Road rage?  How would Jesus drive?&quot;; &quot;Thank God for dirty dishes.  At least you have food.&quot;  Overall, a fascinating look at this cultural phenomenon.	2003-07-17

The authors chronicle the behind-the-scenes story of the making of the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; films and TV series.  The book also includes a chapter on Tim Burton's reimagined &quot;Apes&quot; film.<br />The book's intro notes that the authors had &quot;complete and total access&quot; to the archives of late &quot;Apes&quot; producer Arthur P. Jacobs; furthermore, many actors and behind-the-scenes talents were interviewed for the project.  This in-depth research really pays off in this engrossing, well-written narrative.  The book is enriched with many quotes from cast and crew and a wealth of photographs.<br />The authors frankly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each film, as well as controversies attached to them.  A particularly interesting part of the book is the account of the test reel in which Edward G. Robinson played Dr. Zaius.  The book also discusses the music of the films, and includes episode guides to both the live-action and animated TV series.  This book is essential reading for true &quot;Apes&quot; fans.  Funny, fascinating, and even poignant, it made me want to watch all of these marvelous films again.	2003-07-16

Underwood.  The copyright page of the 2001 edition notes that both text and translation have a 1967 copyright date.  The back cover notes that author Canetti was born in Bulgaria and received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1981.<br />&quot;Voices,&quot; which is divided into 14 short chapters, is the first person account of a visit to the Moroccan city of the title.  Canetti tells of encounters with and observations of camels, beggars, donkeys, merchants, and other inhabitants of the city.  The book is a fascinating record of cross-cultural contact, and includes an intriguing view into the Mellah, the Jewish quarter of Marrakesh.<br />The book is full of vividly rendered scenes; Canetti really brings these people and animals to life on the page.  The book also has a dark edge as he recounts the exploitative underside of the city.  Literacy and linguistic difference are also key themes.<br />&quot;Voices&quot; is a short text (103 pages), but rich in mystery, tragedy, and wonder.  As a companion text I recommend &quot;The Jaguar Smile,&quot; by Salman Rushdie.	2003-07-14

I was motivated to read the book after first reading Al Franken's hilarious parody of the genre, &quot;Oh, The Things I Know!&quot;; I would recommend it as a companion text.<br />Quindlen offers some advice pertaining to the title topic.  Along the way she quotes Yogi Berra, John Lennon, and Gwendolyn Brooks, and cites the New Testament.  I felt the strongest part of the book was her very personal account about how experiencing the death of a family member impacted her.<br />Yes, some of Quindlen's phrases strike me as a bit too self-consciously cute, and the concluding anecdote may be too sentimental.  But the part of the book I found most effective is Quindlen's metaphor of having a personal reawakening or rebirth; this section is powerful and well written.  Quindlen's &quot;Guide&quot; may not be the final word on the meaning of life, but it's a worthwhile read.	2003-07-14

The novel has been translated from Russian into English by Andrew Bromfield.  This is a bizarre, surreal novel that vividly evokes Soviet culture and ideals.  There are some really grotesque and absurd scenes, and some vivid visual images.	2003-07-13

All are set at the saloon of the title.  Callahan's has a colorful collection of regulars and is often visited by aliens, time travelers, and humans with paranormal gifts.  The book contains a fascinating introduction by Ben Bova entitled &quot;Spider Robinson: The SF Writer as Empath.&quot;<br />This book is a great blend of humor and science fiction.  Robinson puts inventive spins on classic sci-fi themes.  He also deals effectively with such down-to-earth issues as war, motherhood, and personal loss.  The book is also full of puns--the Callahan's regulars observe a Punday contest.<br />Along the way Robinson invokes Isaac Asimov and Charles Fort.  The book as a whole is grounded by a real compassion for the human (and nonhuman!) condition--this is sci-fi with both brains and heart.	2003-07-13

Rowling's &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;?  The release of this, the fifth installment in the Harry Potter series, is a genuine worldwide cultural phenomenon.  At 870 pages, this book is epic in size, but it's a fast, compelling read.<br />&quot;Order&quot; continues the saga of boy wizard Harry.  Our hero is clearly growing up--a key theme is that he and his classmates are beginning that transition from childhood to young adulthood.  And it's an especially difficult transition, occurring as it does in the midst of an epic struggle between good and evil forces.<br />&quot;Order&quot; is at times quite dark and unsettling--a key theme throughout the book is an internal power struggle within the wizard world.  This struggle has a serious impact on Harry's beloved Hogwarts school.  But the darkness of the story is well counterbalanced by the friendship, excitement, and magic that are so intrinsic to Harry's world.<br />Rowling has not lost her own magic touch.  She brings back many familiar characters and introduces some interesting new ones--including a truly infuriating antagonist for Harry.  There are some inventive surprises and amazing scenes along the way. And we learn more about important non-human species that inhabit this magical universe.  Rowling may have had to face high expectations, but she delivers with this book.  It's a big, satisfying tale that left me eager to return to Harry's world.	2003-07-13

The book contains an introduction by Jeff Poniewaz, who discusses Antler's literary career and his relationship with another great poet, Allen Ginsberg.<br />Antler's work is humane, shamanic, erotic (both homo- and hetero-), earthy, satiric, horrific, mystical, and playful.  It's also often quite funny--I chuckled in delight a number of times while reading the book.  Antler invokes a number of poets in his own work: Neruda, Lorca, Plath, Keats, etc.  But the name most often raised is that of Walt Whitman.  In the acknowledgements section of the book Antler claims Whitman as his &quot;spiritual father,&quot; and indeed in these poems I see Antler carrying forward a poetic/prophetic torch he inherited from Whitman.<br />Antler writes in a direct, clear, muscular style that is ripe with the smells of life.  He sometimes plays with words in a way which reminds me of E.E. Cummings.  He is, to use his own words, &quot;the scholar of winks and the archeologist of guffaws&quot;--a composer of &quot;visionary sexpoems/ and marijuana hymns.&quot;  Like Whitman, his vision embraces &quot;every Livingkind.&quot;  In a number of poems he explores and defends poetry itself, and ponders the role of the poet in our world.<br />Antler is a poet of the natural world--a defender of the earth, and he also writes with compassion for the downtrodden workers in the world of human industry.  He finds revelations in plants, animals, terrain, and in his fellow human beings.  Antler's is a remarkable voice--full of love, outrage, and sexual energy, and this book is rich, powerful, and rewarding poetic testament.	2003-07-13

Books	5	14	15	N	N	A fiery and insightful jeremiad	&quot;Can God Bless America?&quot; by John MacArthur, is a non-fiction work that addresses theological and ethical issues.  The book is a challenge to the evangelical Christians of the United States in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.<br />MacArthur expresses skepticism about the &quot;widespread revival&quot; of the slogan &quot;God bless America&quot; after the terrorist attacks.  He asks the fundamental question: Should God bless America?  The essence of the author's challenge to his fellow Christians is given in chapter 3: &quot;We must confess our guilt, revive our consciences, turn from our sin, and turn to God.&quot;<br />Yes, at times MacArthur goes after some obvious targets (Ozzy Osbourne, environmentalists, homosexuality, etc.).  But the best part of the book is a spirited and cutting critique of the &quot;Religious Right,&quot; its moralistic crusades and its political alliances.  He offers a devastating 16-point critique of the Religious Right's brand of moralism.<br />I'm not an evangelical fundamentalist Christian myself, so I very much approached this book as an outsider.  And I found it to be stimulating, daring and well-written.	2003-07-09

An interesting foreword by Noel Perrin discusses Frost's life and career.  The book contains some poems which will surely be familiar to many readers--&quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,&quot; &quot;Mending Wall,&quot; etc.  But that's just part of the treasures in this collection.<br />Overall, this collection shows Frost's concern with nature and rural life.  Many different animals and plants are celebrated: ants, cows, birch trees, etc.  Many of the poems have a beautiful musical quality, and the collection as a whole shows an interesting variety of meter and rhyme schemes.<br />I'll just mention a few of my favorite poems.  &quot;Acquainted with the Night&quot; is a hauntingly melancholy sonnet.  &quot;A Patch of Old Snow&quot; well demonstrates Frost's keen observing eye and way with figurative language.  &quot;The Rose Family&quot; has a comic playfulness that I found quite Seussian.  &quot;Fireflies in the Garden&quot; is a humorous short poem with an interesting AAA BBB rhyme scheme.  Overall, an enjoyable and rewarding collection by an essential American poet.	2003-07-09

Salinger's &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is one of those books that seems to be surrounded by the aura of its own myth and hype.  So the question is: does it live up to this hype?  After reading it for the first time, I am of the opinion that while &quot;Catcher&quot; doesn't quite live up to its own legend, it is still an engrossing read.<br />&quot;Catcher&quot; tells the story of Holden Caulfield, a troubled young man who has just gotten kicked out of prep school.  The novel follows his physical and mental wanderings after leaving the school.  Along the way are some interesting glimpses of New York City's sleazy underbelly in the post-World War II years.<br />The copyright page notes that the Little, Brown edition of &quot;Catcher&quot; was originally published in 1951.  I imagine that Holden's smoking, drinking, and musings about sex may have been shocking at the time, but it's pretty tame stuff today.  Still, I can't help but like a main character who boasts that he's &quot;the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life.&quot;<br />Much of the book seems to be written in a sort of &quot;code.&quot; Little hints along the way indicate that narrator Holden is not being totally honest with us, with himself, or with both--even though on the surface the narrative should be the truth behind the lies he tells to other characters within the story.  What is Holden's real unsaid truth?  I won't give my interpretation, but will leave that to each reader.<br />In the end, &quot;Catcher&quot; is a classic that still commands our attention.  It's an ironic and challenging text that rewards the attentive reader.	2003-07-08

Cummings, is a collection of 70 poems numbered with Roman numerals.  The afterword by George James Firmage notes that an earlier edition of the book (one riddled with errors) was published back in 1931.<br />&quot;ViVa&quot; shows Cummings to be one of the most distinctive and inventive poets in the English language.  He uses a lot of eye-catching, and apparently made-up, words: &quot;fasterishly,&quot; &quot;infrafairy,&quot; &quot;uneyes,&quot; &quot;firsting,&quot; &quot;nonglance,&quot; etc.  In many of his poems he experiments with punctuation, word structure, word order, and capitalization in startling ways--he's like a sculptor playfully molding the English language into strange new shapes.<br />But I must admit that I found some of his poems too experimental--to the point of incomprehensibility.  Still, even his most impenetrable poems are stimulating in odd ways.  Many poems imitate people's speech; some raise theological questions.  There is a sadness to much of the book in the form of poems that touch on the despair, loneliness, and dislocation of modern life.  But these are balanced by some truly striking and beautiful love poems.  There is also a satirical element present in the book.<br />When Cummings' experiments succeed, he really dazzles; consider poem XXXVIII, where the words seem to really dance and crackle across the page.  His imagery at its best is fresh and invigorating.  &quot;ViVa&quot; is not an easy read, but it's a remarkable work from a true original.	2003-07-03

The copyright page notes that the book was first published in 1972.  This is a remarkable book that often reads like some apocryphal sacred text.  The book is dominated by its title character, who is the focus of a significant number of the poems.  Crow is a multifaceted character with mythic heft: he is a warrior, theologian, trickster, and partner with God in creation.  He is both heroic and ridiculous, foolish and wise.  He's a compelling and delightful character who ultimately transcends all cultures and historical eras.<br />The collection as a whole is whimsical, witty, apocalyptic, bold, revelatory, irreverent, visceral, horrific, and playful.  At times, Hughes' poetic marriage of the earthy and the mystical reminded me of Walt Whitman.  The book also calls to mind traditional Native American animal stories.<br />Many of the poems in &quot;Crow&quot; touch on the magic and power of words.  The natural world is another key recurring motif.  Hughes delivers some striking images and some interesting arrangements of words on the page--many poems really engage the eye.  Many poems read like religious litanies.  Overall, an impressive and enjoyable poetic achievement.	2003-07-02

There is also an editor's note by Donald Allen.  The book is divided into 4 main sections.  &quot;A Recollection,&quot; by Saijo, is an 11 page memoir of the road trip during which the poems in the book were written.  &quot;We Started for New York,&quot; also about the trip, is the opening of an unfinished novel by Welch.  The main text, &quot;Trip Trap,&quot; is a body of poetry attributed to all three as a collaborative effort.  And finally, &quot;Dear Jack&quot; is a collection of letters (dated 1959-60) from Welch to Kerouac.<br />&quot;Trip Trap&quot; is thus, despite its short length (69 + vii pages), a diverse text with a fascinating history behind it.  The poems are not haiku in the strictest sense; I would call them &quot;haiku-like.&quot;  The poems offer some interesting imagery and reflections on the American landscape, as well as a number of literary references.  We get many glimpses from the men's journey--radio antennas in Texas, cows in Nebraska, a cross on an Arizona highway, etc.  A particularly interesting section involves a Saijo haiku with alternate versions by Welch and Kerouac.<br />The book overall is infused with the sense of discovery one gets in traveling across the USA.  Saijo notes that the poetry in the book &quot;has the fathomless art of random speech overheard through the course of a day.&quot;  I really enjoyed &quot;Trip Trap.&quot;	2003-07-02

This daring plan is masterminded by veteran artilleryman Impey Barbicane, president of the Baltimore Gun Club.  The novel follows the progress and remarkable outcome of the venture.<br />&quot;Earth. . .Moon&quot; is a terrific adventure story and a pioneering classic of 19th century science fiction.  It's also an affectionate satire of the United States and the American character as seen through Verne's eyes.  Verne's witty writing had me laughing out loud throughout the book.  And furthermore, the novel is about courage, loyalty, and faith in the ability of human beings to overcome incredible obstacles.<br />Verne populates his adventure tale with a number of likeable and memorably drawn characters.  He cleverly mixes in real scientific data with his fantastic tale.  He also establishes the book's literary genealogy early on with references to Locke's Moon Hoax and Edgar Allan Poe's story of Hans Pfaal.<br />I read this book in the Lowell Bair translation, which is published as a Bantam Classic.  &quot;Earth. . .Moon&quot; is suspenseful and exciting; it's also surprisingly poignant and ultimately inspiring.  It's an enduring masterpiece by one of the 19th century's great visionary geniuses.	2003-06-19

The book is illustrated by Jack E. Davis. In this installment, New York City schoolboy Zack becomes trapped in the Rosencrantz Museum of Natural History while on a school trip.<br />In the book's first paragraph Zack wonders, \\"And when the museum closes and the lights go out, do strange things happen?\\"  Well, he finds out the answer to that question--an answer which is in keeping with the overall paranormal theme of the series.  I found this mix of horror and humor to be a highly entertaining installment in the series.  The suspenseful tale is well enhanced by Davis' whimsical drawings.	2003-06-19

Overall, this collection shows Alcott's wit, humor, compassion for humanity, attentive eye, and particular concern for women's issues.  This short (55 + vii pages) book is a wonderful collection by one of the most remarkable figures in American literature.	2003-06-17

Naipaul, tells the story of Willie Chandran, born to a priestly caste father and a lower caste woman in India.  The novel follows its conflicted protagonist to England and to a Portuguese colony in Africa; along the way we see both his romantic/sexual strivings and his efforts to express himself as a writer.<br />This book offers a fascinating glimpse at the disintegration of colonial regimes in India and Africa.  This is a novel with a truly global span; Naipaul creates an intriguing group of characters and interrelationships.  There are a number of characters whose relationships or backgrounds reflect the crossing of lines of caste, color, and/or ethnicity.  The story is nicely enhanced by Naipaul's straightforward prose style.  It's a tale of love, rebellion, loss, regret, and the quest for identity.	2003-06-17

Gomes, is part of the Zondervan Guide to Cults and Religious Movements series.  It's a relatively short book (94 pages), but densely packed with information.  The book is an examination of Unitarian Universalism from a fundamentalist/evangelical Christian perspective.  The book even includes witnessing tips for those who may be motivated to try to convert a UU to Christian fundamentalism.<br />This book is actually a remarkably interesting and useful source of information about UUism, even though the facts are often presented with an obvious negative bias.  The text covers many aspects of UUism: history, social activism, &quot;faith stances&quot; within UUism, the historic heritage of Transcendentalism and Humanism, etc.<br />Unfortunately, the author's bias against and hostility towards UUism makes this one of those books that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  He is particularly harsh on those UUs who identify as Christian within the UU umbrella; he declares that their way of being Christian is &quot;counterfeit and cultic.&quot;<br />Although I am not a member of any UU church (yet!), I have had some experience of UUism and find Gomes' portrait to be somewhat unfair and misleading when he strays from hard facts.  Still, the bibliography, wealth of footnotes, and many hard facts in this book make it a great resource for those who can read critically past the author's bias.  I recommend you choose as companion texts some of the many fine pamphlets and books put out by the UUs.	2003-06-15

The copyright page notes that the book was originally published in French in 1958.  The author bio at the end of the book informs us that the Hungarian-born Wiesel was deported to Auschwitz and Buchenwald and eventually received the Nobel Peace Prize.<br />\\"Night\\" is a first-person account of surviving the Nazi Holocaust.  The narrative spans the years 1941-45 and recounts the atrocities committed against the European Jews by Hitler's regime.  At 109 pages, the narrative is slim, but it is powerful.<br />Wiesel vividly depicts the dehumanization of concentration camp inmates.  He effectively recounts the details of life in the shadow of Hitler; the Holocaust experience is depicted as a nightmarish mix of absurdity and horror.  Some key questions raised by the narrative are theological; for example, how can anyone continue to have faith in a deity in light of these horrors?<br />Wiesel's prose, as translated by Rodway, is stark and grim--very effective for his subject matter.  The well-written text leads up to a truly haunting final image.  I recommend this book not only to those interested in the Holocaust, but to anyone interested in human cruelty and the human will to survive.	2003-06-12

I read this book as a Dover Thrift Edition.  The book includes a 4-page introductory note that discusses the life and career of Yeats (1865-1939), who received the Nobel Prize in Literature.  A bibliographic note on the copyright page states that the Dover edition contains Yeats' poems from the volumes \\"The Wild Swans at Coole\\" and \\"Michael Robartes and the Dancer.\\"<br />Although I found many of these poems obscure and hard to penetrate, I also found many of them haunting and beautiful.  And many of the difficult poems opened up to me after additional readings.  A mystical thread, as well as an attentiveness to nature, runs throughout this collection.<br />This book is rich in literary, religious, and mythological allusions.  Yeats writes of war, death, grief, aging, love, and beauty.  Many of the poems are quite musical--Yeats uses interesting variations in line length, rhyme scheme, poem length, and other effects.<br />Interestingly, I found the most effective poems in this collection to be those that deal with the relationships and encounters between humans and animals: the majestic \\"The Wild Swans at Coole,\\" the tender \\"To a Squirrel at Kyle-Na-Gno,\\" the haunting \\"On a Political Prisoner,\\" the playful and mystical \\"The Cat and the Moon,\\" and others.<br />Of course, there are many additional memorable poems in this collection, such as the deliciously satiric \\"The Scholars,\\" or \\"The Second Coming,\\" which has a real prophetic flavor.  Overall, a remarkable volume by a significant figure in 20th century literature.	2003-06-08

Because there are some continuous story elements, the book almost reads like a graphic novel.  The copyright page notes that the book's contents have copyright dates from 1990 to 1992.<br />Orner fleshes out Ethan's world with some entertaining supporting characters, such as his friend Buck and lesbian couple Liza and Beth.  But my favorite supporting character is Madame Zolna, Ethan's deliciously sarcastic \\"psychic\\" advisor; the Zolna episodes have real bite.<br />Along the way Orner satirizes love, dating, politics, \\"outing,\\" sex, representations of gays in popular culture, and other topics.  Celebrities (like Madonna and Kitty Kelly) are occasionally spoofed.  Orner's drawing style is fun, quirky, and occasionally a bit raunchy.  Overall, this is a witty, intelligent, compassionate, and very entertaining glimpse at gay life.  Essential reading for fans of cutting-edge comics.	2003-06-07

Although he is unable to move or communicate, Shawn possesses both a keen intelligence and the ability to perfectly remember anything he encounters.<br />Shawn has a troubled connection to his father, a poet who has earned fame by writing about his disabled son.  This is a well-written and fascinating novel.  In the character of Shawn's father, Trueman effectively explores the relationship between art and life.<br />This powerful story raises some difficult ethical issues.  Shawn is a compelling and skillfully realized character.  At one point Shawn refers to Helen Keller and the play \\"The Miracle Worker.\\"  Like that play, this book is a valuable addition to the body of literature that deals with human disability and human dignity.	2003-06-07

The copyright page notes that the contents of the book originally appeared in single issue form as \\"Transmetropolitan\\" 1-3.<br />This vividly illustrated tale focuses on Spider Jerusalem, a journalist in a futuristic city.  This is very much a science fiction story, spiced with references such as one to a Martian secession movement.  In this volume Spider investigates a controversy involving an emergent subculture of genetically altered humans.<br />The tattooed, chain-smoking, gun-toting Spider is a compelling protagonist.  The book is violent but intelligently written and often quite funny.  The story raises questions about police conduct, multiculturalism, the First Amendment, and the role of the journalist in society.  It's a remarkable book that has whetted my appetite for more of Spider's saga.	2003-06-07

This is a fantasy tale about a race of intelligent unicorns who live in a realm apart from, but connected to, Earth.  As the story opens we discover that one of the unicorns and his human companion have both been injured and are in a precarious situation in the human world.<br />Overall I enjoyed the story.  Stanton is especially effective in her presentation of interspecies relationships in a fantasy setting.  There is also an intriguing villain.<br />At times I found the language a little too corny and New Age-y for my tastes.  I also didn't like the fact that the book really doesn't hold up as a stand-alone story; the cliffhanger ending seems to lead directly into volume 2.  But the imaginative story, together with some clever touches along the way, make it a solid fantasy effort.	2003-06-07

Wells, is the story of an adventurous inventor who builds the fantastic device of the book's title.  With this marvelous device he travels to the year 802,701 AD, where he discovers a vastly changed humanity.<br />This book is a great classic--it's a science fiction landmark written with both brains and heart.  Despite its short length it really has the scope and flavor of an epic--think of it as a miniature epic.  Wells achieves a flawless blend of horror, mystery, adventure, and social satire as his traveler explores this strange new world.  Wells' superb descriptive language really brings this bizarre future to life.<br />For some stimulating companion texts, try Octavia Butler's &quot;Kindred,&quot; David Gerrold's &quot;The Man Who Folded Himself,&quot; and Edwin Abbott's &quot;Flatland.&quot;  &quot;The Time Machine&quot; is one of those great classics which remains both enjoyable and thought-provoking; it's perfect from its evocative opening sentence to its heartbreaking final sentence.	2003-06-07

This volume contains poems about the Civil Rights movement in the United States, love, despair, and other topics.  Particularly interesting is a sequence of poems describing Africa as seen through the eyes of an African-American.<br />Walker's poems are written in a clear, smooth, often striking language.  Some standout pieces are as follows.  \\"African Images\\": a sequence of 45 haiku-like stanzas.  \\"Karamojans\\": an ironic and tragic portrait of the \\"proud people\\" of the title.  The title poem: illuminates the ugliness of American racism and the beauty of those who stand against it.  \\"Compulsory Chapel\\": shows a welcome touch of dry humor.  \\"Mornings / of an impossible love\\": a sequence of prose poems.  \\"Johann\\": a striking, visually evocative poem that explores the possibility of interracial love.<br />I have great admiration for Walker's skill as a novelist and essayist.  \\"Once\\" shows her to also be a poet of sensitivity and grace.	2003-06-03

The pieces in this book (I refer to the Dover Thrift Edition), all originally published between 1892 and 1920, are as follows: &quot;Lou, the Prophet,&quot; &quot;Eric Hermannson's Soul,&quot; &quot;The Enchanted Bluff,&quot; &quot;Paul's Case,&quot; and &quot;A Wagner Matinee.&quot;<br />These stories take us to Nebraska farm country as well as to Pittsburgh, Boston, and New York City.  Cather writes of Danish and Norwegian immigrants, religion, &quot;high&quot; culture, regret, loss, and regional legend.<br />The title story is a particularly fascinating character study of a boy who doesn't fit into society--you might think of him as sort of a literary ancestor of J.D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield.  Throughout the collection Cather demonstrates a telling eye for visual detail and a keen sense of human tragedy.	2003-06-03

In the course of the text Franken particularly singles out two contributors to the genre--Anna Quindlen and Maria Shriver--for mockery.<br />Franken covers a wide range of life experiences: sex, drugs, religion, marriage, parenthood, finances, volunteerism, etc.  Along the way he pokes fun at many targets: commencement addresses, Oprah's Book Club, the Enron scandal, etc.  Both brainy and playfully vulgar, he's not afraid to hit below the belt--or go for the jugular.  His prose style is mischievous and engaging, yet drips with sarcasm.<br />The chapters have such amusing titles as \\"Oh, the Weight You Will Gain!\\" and \\"Oh, the People You'll Sue!\\"  This book made me laugh out loud several times.  In fact, at one point I laughed so hard I nearly fell down and injured myself.  And that's probably the best praise one can give to a book like this.	2003-05-27

The text of this Dover Children's Thrift Classic is accompanied by the whimsical illustrations of Thea Kliros.  Both tales are set in the Dutch-American communities of rural New York State.<br />\\"Legend\\" tells the story of Ichabod Crane, a schoolteacher who lives in an area purportedly haunted by a terrifying spectre: a headless horseman.  \\"Rip\\" tells the story of a farmer who has a remarkable paranormal experience while wandering in the mountains.<br />Each story explores the intersection of the supernatural with everyday life.  The stories are full of vividly drawn characters and are rich with the local color of rural Dutch American communities.  Issues such as folk beliefs, geography, history and oral tradition are well handled by Irving.<br />Irving's playful, earthy prose style is a delight to read.  Passages such as a description of a Dutch-American feast are memorable.  Funny, ironic, and poignant, these tales are true classics by one of the most enduring figures in American literature.	2003-05-26

While Cymbala's intentions are clearly good, I found the book stale and narrow of vision.<br />First of all, the book is clearly written to an exclusive fundamentalist Christian audience and much of it will likely be either irrelevant or a turn-off to readers of other faith traditions.  In fact, Cymbala (who is identified as the pastor of the Brooklyn Tabernacle on the book cover) makes a point of criticizing multi-faith inclusivity.  He makes it clear that his only interest in, for example, Muslims is as potential converts to his faith system.<br />Other than that, I found his thoughts on the theological ramifications of 9-11 to be shallow and obvious: God's ways are inscrutable, people have free will, anything can be seen as a blessing if it leads us to pray more, etc.  If you're looking for something that addresses 9-11 in a really thoughtful and moving way, I suggest you look elsewhere.	2003-05-25

This novel tells the story of Edith Adelon, an Italian orphan who lives with the aristocratic Hamilton family.  This is a sentimental, romantic story about love, treachery, and a family secret.  Class stratification is a significant theme.<br />Yes, the characters are fairly shallow, the plot is predictable, and the dialogue is often very stiff and corny.  But I found &quot;The Inheritance&quot; quite charming and enjoyable.  The mild suspense leads ultimately to a satisfying conclusion.  Along the way are some memorable scenes, such as a sequence involving the creation of historical tableaux.<br />The Penguin Classics edition includes an excellent, substantial introduction by Joel Myerson and Daniel Shealy.  They discuss Alcott's remarkable life and career and place &quot;The Inheritance&quot; in literary and cultural context.	2003-05-22

A brief note at the beginning of the book discusses the life and career of Carroll (1832-98), who was a mathematician as well as a poet.  The selections in this book are taken from &quot;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,&quot; &quot;Through the Looking Glass,&quot; and other sources.<br />This collection shows Carroll's quirky, mischievous playfulness as well as his technical prowess with rhyme, meter, and wordplay.  He is consistently inventive and often satirical.  The book is very funny, often quite absurd, and has an occasional dark, sinister edge.<br />Just a few of the highlights are as follows.  &quot;The Mouse's Tale&quot;: a visual poem shaped like a mouse's tale.  &quot;Brother and Sister&quot;: a hilarious tribute to sibling rivalry that uses an interesting rhyme scheme.  &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter&quot;: a sort of narrative horror-comedy with rich touches of absurdism.  &quot;Poeta Fit, non Nascitur&quot;: a hilarious satire on the art of writing poetry.

Despite being a stage play, it also works superbly as a reader's text apart from a theatrical setting.<br />The plot begins thus: Scottish warrior Macbeth is told by three witches that he is destined to ascend the throne.  This fateful prophecy sets in motion a plot full of murder, deceit, warfare, and psychological drama.<br />Despite being a lean play, \\"Macbeth\\" is densely layered and offers the careful reader rewards on many levels.  Woven into the violent and suspenseful story are a host of compelling issues: gender identity, the paranormal, leadership, guilt, etc.  In one sense, the play is all about reading and misreading (i.e. with regard to Macbeth's \\"reading\\" of the witches' prophecies), so at this level the play has a rich metatextual aspect.<br />Macbeth is one of Shakespeare's most unforgettable tragic characters.  His story is told using some of English literature's richest and most stunning language.	2003-05-17

The author bio at the beginning of the book notes that in 1986 the Nigerian-born Soyinka became the first African writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.<br />Overall this book has a global, multicultural and multifaith vision.  Soyinka writes about writers and writing itself, personal struggle, economic injustice, etc.  His writing has an elegant muscularity; his voice is learned and serious, passionate and politically engaged.<br />I felt that some of the longer poems didn't quite hold up all the way through.  But there are some really stunning standouts in the entire collection.  &quot;Doctored Vision,&quot; about a poet's consultation with an optician, is an amazing narrative poem that is rich in symbolic potential.  &quot;Twelve Canticles for the Zealot. . .&quot; is a powerful exploration of religious intolerance and violence.<br />Overall, this is a worthwhile volume by a poet who I see as a kindred spirit to Walt Whitman, Audre Lorde, and Pablo Neruda.  If you want to be a real citizen of the world, I recommend you read Soyinka.	2003-05-16

Lewis, tells the story of a bus ride from hell to heaven.  The title is a riff on William Blake's &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,&quot; which Lewis cites in his preface.<br />Although Christian theology is briefly cited in the book, it seems that Lewis' overall point--to promote belief in and adoration of a supreme being--is as applicable to Jews, Muslims, and many others as it would be to Christians.  To quote the book directly: &quot;There is but one good; that is God.&quot;<br />The story is full of wonderful visual images and imaginative flourishes that give the book the flavor of classic fantasy literature.  And although at times the book has a certain smug quality, it is entertaining and thought-provoking.  Lewis' prose style is consistently engaging.	2003-05-16

The Methuen Modern Plays edition contains an introduction by Stuart Hood; Fo himself contributes an author's note and a postscript.  The opening pages note that the original Italian edition had a copyright date of 1970.  The author's note describes how the play was inspired by the death of an anarchist being held in police custody.<br />This outrageous comedy opens with a character known as the \\"Maniac\\" being brought to a police station.  It's a very \\"metatheatrical\\" piece; Fo warps theatrical conventions and makes jokes in a way that reminds me a bit of Luigi Pirandello's \\"Six Characters in Search of an Author.\\"  There are some really funny scenes, but a very serious vein still runs throughout the piece.<br />Ultimately, this is a thought-provoking piece about truth.  What is the true story, and how do you discover it?  Fo's satiric wit explores police brutality as well as the relationships among the police, the media, and the political establishment.  I recommend this piece by the Nobel Prize winning Fo to all with an interest in 20th century drama and/or political activism.	2003-05-08

It's a short book--only 51 pages long.  A capsule bio on the dustcover notes that Saramago was born in Portugal and received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998.<br />This short tale has the flavor of a parable or fable.  It concerns a man on a quest to find an unknown island.  The story opens in an unnamed kingdom, and none of the characters have proper names; this gives the tale a sort of universal, mythic feel.<br />The story is well enhanced by Sis's charming, surreal illustrations.  Saramago weaves some nice concrete details into the story.  His prose style, as translated by Costa, is smooth and clear.  This is a story of discovery with an open-ended but satisfying conclusion.	2003-05-08

This Dover edition, which is edited by Joan R.

These dialect pieces have an energetic color and musicality. Many poems also show McKay's command of standard literary English; he writes some particularly fine sonnets.<br />Overall, this is a rich, diverse, and technically adept collection. There are many pointedly political poems that condemn racism and economic injustice, as well as sensuous love poems. There are poems that invoke both the rural tropics and the urban north.<br />These poems show McKay to be a master of meter, rhyme, and other aspects of poetry; he uses considerable variety throughout the collection. His best pieces combine a burning passion with his impressive technical prowess. Consider \\"A Capitalist at Dinner,\\" a cutting political sonnet with a devastating final couplet; or \\"Song of the New Soldier and Worker,\\" another political piece that uses stunning imagery and masterful audio effects.<br />McKay uses words as both lethal weapons against the forces of injustice and as tender instruments of passionate love. He is a poet of tremendous talent, and this collection is a real treasure.	2003-05-04

For laugh-out-loud funny, however, the elephant story is my favorite. A perfect book both for literature courses or just for individual pleasure reading.	2003-05-04

Delany with Amy Hill Hearth. Their text is accompanied by illustrations by Brian M. Kotzky. This book contains the reflections of 107-year old Sarah \\"Sadie\\" Delany after the death of her sister and lifetime companion Bessie at the age of 104.<br />A foreword by coauthor Hearth discusses the lives of these two extraordinary African-American women and the success of their book \\"Having Our Say,\\" published in 1993 and adapted as a Broadway play. Bessie was a pioneering dentist, and Sadie a teacher; remaining unmarried, the two enjoyed a lifetime partnership that lasted over a century.<br />The main body of the text is divided into four parts, each with an introductory section by a 3rd person narrator. But the bulk of the text consists of Sadie's first-person reflections. Interspersed throughout the text are Kotzky's beautiful full color illustrations of the many flowers that longtime gardener Bessie loved: crocuses, tulips, rhododendrons, coral bells, etc.<br />This is a wonderful book about family, faith, growing old with grace, and surviving the death of one's life partner. Sadie's voice is wonderfully moving and sometimes funny. Ultimately the book celebrates the cycles of life.<br />This book is a touching tribute to Bessie Delany and a celebration of the enduring partnership she shared with her sister. Early in the book Sadie declares, \\"Why, I have been so blessed in my life!\\" Likewise are we readers blessed with this beautiful book. Recommended especially for those with an interest in women's studies, African-American studies, flower gardening, and issues related to the elderly.	2003-04-20

This book includes a short introductory note on the colorful life and career of the author, who lived from 1862 to 1910.<br />I really enjoyed this book from start to finish. O. Henry writes about criminals, dreamers, artists, lovers, and lost souls. Many of these stories have a New York City setting--he really captures the energy and color of the city. There are also a Western story (\\"The Pimienta Pancakes\\"), a Southern Gothic tale (\\"A Municipal Report\\"), a story set primarily in a small town in Arkansas (\\"A Retrieved Reformation\\"), and a story set in rural Alabama (\\"The Ransom of Red Chief\\").<br />If you like stories with \\"twist\\" endings, you will probably like this collection. The book as a whole is a lot of fun--full of life and charm. Some of the stories may strike contemporary readers as corny, but I found each tale to be an enjoyable gem of storytelling. The book is rich in irony, with some really funny scenes.<br />O. Henry tells stories of love, justice, deception, sacrifice, and heroism. He makes some intriguing creative choices; this is clearly the work of a master in total command of the short story genre. His prose style is very readable and engaging, with touches of baroque elegance.	2003-04-20

It's a tender, sad, but hopeful story about love, sex, loss, shame, marriage, divorce, death, and Jewishness.<br />Harry is a curious, but oddly likeable character--he's very much a self-conscious outsider with a secretive side.

The author discusses the origins of Islam, ethical relativism, biblical texts, the debate over \\"the hiddenness of God,\\" intolerance in Islamic countries, and United States national values.<br />There are some interesting and effective parts of the book. I was moved by his account of returning home to the U.S. after the tragedy. He also partially reproduces an article written by Muslim scholar Muqtedar Khan, in which Khan challenges the Islamic world to do some soul-searching in the post 9-11 context. Zacharias himself challenges moderate Muslims to speak out against violence done in the name of Islam.<br />I found the most problematic part of the book to be the author's attitude towards Islam. There is a subtle vein of hostility towards Islam running throughout the book, such as when he claims that Islam can be \\"demanding [. . .] of the American culture to provide it unlimited freedom.\\" An unqualified statement like that hurts Zacharias' credibility in my mind. At times it seems like he wants to criticize Islam more pointedly but is trying to be politically correct about it. He also presents a naively rosy view of Christendom as a whole.<br />Ultimately, I found few new insights in this book. But I think it is still worth reading for those seeking more perspectives on 9-11.	2003-04-16

Mainly science fiction, the collection also encompasses fantasy, horror and satire.<br />In his intro, Sarrantonio notes that he was inspired by Harlan Ellison's important 1967 anthology \\"Dangerous Visions.\\" Many of the stories in this book deal with adult themes: rape, addiction, bondage, war, etc. There is some graphic sex and violence, but I did not find these elements to be gratuitous.<br />Some of the most memorable pieces in the collection include Laura Whitton's \\"Froggies,\\" about the difficulty of interspecies communication; Harry Turtledove's \\"Black Tulip,\\" a stylish tale set during the Soviet-Afghan conflict; Robert E. Vardeman's \\"Feedback,\\" a stunning tale about telepaths and illicit sexuality; Rudy Rucker & John Shirley's \\"Pockets,\\" a story of higher dimensions which draws on the classic \\"Flatland\\"; and Joe Haldeman's \\"Road Kill,\\" about \\"a serial murderer with an interesting specialty.\\"<br />Other authors represented in the anthology include Michael Moorcock, Ursula K.

The book is edited by Irigaray and Sylvere Lotringer. Camille Collins is credited as primary translator, although there are a few sections that have others credited as translators.<br />The introduction by Irigaray (dated 1998) discusses the relationship of interviews to written texts. The interviews in this book generally discuss her own corpus of written texts.<br />Overall, I found this book very thought-provoking. Irigaray discusses feminism, mother-daughter relationships, language, and spirituality. Particularly fascinating are her observations on the \\"sexed\\" nature of language; this material reminds me somewhat of the debates over Black English. Also intriguing are her discourses on the significance of her other books' titles. She draws on an eclectic body of knowledge, citing Marguerite Yourcenar, Heidegger, Greek mythology, Marx, the life of Jesus, etc.<br />At times she strikes me as overly fixated on \\"sexual difference\\" as a \\"universal reality.\\" Nevertheless, I still find the book intriguing and worthwhile.	2003-04-13

Eliot, is a book of poems about cats. The basis for the wildly successful musical &quot;Cats,&quot; the book stands on its own as a delightful work of literature. The poems are accompanied by wonderful illustrations by Edward Gorey.<br />This book is hilarious and very enjoyable. Eliot's words leap and dance across the pages with a zany musicality. Gorey's accompanying artwork is whimsical and full of interesting details. Eliot has created some great feline characters: the fearsome Growltiger, dapper Bustopher Jones, Magical Mr. Mistoffelees, and more.<br />Yes, these poems are great fun to read. But if you are inclined to look closer and analyze them at a deeper literary level, you will find that each one is a masterpiece of poetic craftsmanship. Eliot uses a wonderful variety of meters, rhyme schemes, and various poetic effects. Each poem stands on its own, and together they form an effective artistic unity.<br />Also noteworthy is the very &quot;English&quot; flavor of the book, which Eliot achieves by spicing his poems with many references to English geography and cultural history. Highly recommended, whether or not you like cats.	2003-04-10

The author bio at the beginning of the book notes that the author was born on Antigua. A lean 81 pages, this is nonetheless a powerful text.<br />Kincaid discusses British colonialism, the corruption of the Antiguan government, racism, and greed. It seems to me a key question raised by the book is whether post-colonial Antigua is worse than colonial Antigua. The book is very much haunted by the spectre of New World slavery.<br />This book is a dark, angry jeremiad. I think it works better when seen as an extended prose poem rather than as an essay. As the latter, it could be criticized as full of invalid generalizations and undocumented claims. But as a poetic/prophetic text, it is chillingly effective.<br />Ultimately, Kincaid's vision of the human condition is extremely negative But her haunting, almost hypnotic prose really held me. I recommend the book to anyone planning a trip to a poor country for their own pleasure.	2003-04-09

A bibliographic note in the Dover edition states that the play was first performed in 1920 and published in 1921. It's a one-act play in 8 scenes.<br />The play tells the story of Rufus Jones, a former Pullman porter who has become the monarch of a West Indian island. But as the play opens there is trouble in his empire.<br />This is a surreal, nightmarish character study, full of violent and disturbing images. There is some biting dialogue, as well as an intriguing exploration of tension between Black Christianity and Black &quot;heathen&quot; religion.<br />Jones is a memorable figure, powerful and tragic. O'Neill's stage directions are full of fascinating visual and audio touches--his mastery of the genre is quite evident. Ultimately, &quot;Jones&quot; is a haunting meditation on power, belief in the supernatural, and the seemingly inescapable pull of history.	2003-04-08

Mary Griffith was a woman who believed in a strict, oppressive version of Christianity and pressured her gay son to try to \\"change.\\" But after his suicide she reexamined her theology and beliefs about homosexuality and was herself radically transformed.<br />The book begins with Bobby's suicide and then moves back and forth in time to tell 2 parallel stories: that of Bobby's life and that of Mary's life after his death. This is a profoundly moving story, skillfully told by Aarons. Despite the tragic subject matter, I found the book ultimately very hopeful and uplifting. It's a real story of spiritual liberation and rebirth.<br />This is also an important book in that it exposes the deadly danger of anti-gay prejudice. The book includes a useful appendix of organizations that deal with gay/lesbian youth and gay/lesbian issues more generally.	2003-04-08

The TV episode &quot;Whom Gods Destroy&quot; introduced the book's title character, a legendary Starfleet captain. Garth went insane after being granted the shapeshifting abilities of the Antosian people. As the novel starts, Garth has been declared cured of his insanity and boards the Starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; for a mission that will take him back to the Antosians' planet.<br />Overall, I enjoyed this continuation of Garth's story. Garth is a compelling figure. In this book he is very much a man caught between two worlds; although he shares the Antosians' shapeshifting ability, he is not one of them. He thus has a foot in both the Antosian world and his world of Starfleet while being an &quot;outsider&quot; in both spheres. The authors make some effective use of the shapeshifting element as the story progresses.	2003-04-08

First published in 1967, the book has been re-issued in a 30th anniversary edition with an afterword by the author.<br />The book opens in 1941, with 12-year old Piri living in New York with his family. The narrative recounts his growth into manhood; we accompany Piri as he gets into fights, uses illegal drugs, becomes a violent criminal, spends time in prison, and experiences conflict within his own family.<br />This is a raw, powerful book. Thomas has a vigorous, muscular prose style that incorporates many Spanish terms (readers may find the glossary at the end of the book useful). The book raises many questions about racial and ethnic identity as Piri has relationships with many different people of various colors and cultures. Thomas also explores the interconnections of race and religion, and vividly portrays the subculture of prison life.<br />This is an essential book for anyone interested in the Puerto Rican experience on the U.S. mainland. The book has a lot in common with \\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X.\\" Also recommended as a companion text: Miguel Pinero's play \\"Short Eyes.\\"	2003-04-04

The copyright page of the Dover Thrift edition notes that the book is an unabridged republication of the edition published in 1921.<br />In many of these stories conventional notions of plot and character are apparently thrown out the window in favor of a dreamlike, experimental style. At times the stories in this book remind me of the work of Gertrude Stein. Woolf crafts some really memorable phrases and visual images.<br />The longest of the 8 stories, \\"A Society\\" (pp. 3-16) is about a group of women who form a \\"society for asking questions\\" about male contributions to the world. This piece has a rich satirical flavor; in it Woolf raises questions about female creativity and procreativity, the nature of fiction, and the impact of female literary artists.<br />Although at times I often found Woolf's writing obscure, I enjoyed her elegant prose style.	2003-04-04

It's both a practical source of useful information and a fun thing to read in spare minutes.<br />The book reviews the top news stories of 2002, and includes coverage of the war on terrorism. There is a chronology covering 11 Oct. 2001 to 15 Oct 2002. The almanac is packed full of data in many categories: the U.S. government, arts and the media, awards, languages, religions, astronomy, nations of the world, etc. To make the book easy to use there is not only a one-page quick reference index and a more extensive general index, but also a quick thumb index on the back cover.<br />So if you want to know the salary of the Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana, the name of the winner of the 1918 Pulitzer Prize in poetry, the surface area of the island of Elba, the number of Buddhists in Europe, or a huge number of other global facts, you've come to the right source.	2003-04-03

A minibio at the end of the book notes that author Hum Dac Bui was born in Vietnam and came to the U.S. in 1975.<br />I found this book absolutely fascinating. It discusses many aspects of the CaoDai faith: founding, ecclesiastic structure, cosmology, meditation practices, its suppression under the French colonial regime, the components of the altar, etc. Particularly interesting is the exploration of CaoDai's relationship to other faith traditions, like Christianity, Taoism, Unitarian Universalism, and more. Also intriguing is the discussion of French author Victor Hugo, who is considered a CaoDai saint.<br />The book stresses that \\"CaoDai is a thriving, growing, ever expanding theology.\\" The tone throughout is respectful of religious diversity and supportive of interfaith harmony. CaoDai is discussed within the context of a broader interfaith movement.<br />The book also includes a useful glossary. Overall, a really intriguing look at a compelling modern religion.	2003-04-02

Scott version, the delightful Muppet version, the charming Mr. Magoo version, etc., etc. But ultimately true &quot;Carol&quot; lovers should go back to Dickens' original text, which remains a great read.<br />&quot;Carol&quot; tells the story of cold-hearted miser Ebenezer Scrooge, who despises the Christmas holiday and scorns all who celebrate it. But a visit from a series of supernatural beings forces him to reevaluate his attitude--and his life.<br />With this simple plot Dickens has created one of the enduring triumphs of world literature. It's a robust mix of humor, horror, and (most of all) hope, all leavened with a healthy dash of progressive social criticism. One thing I love about this book is that while it has a focus on a Christian holiday, Dickens puts forth a message that is truly universal; I can imagine this story resonating with people of any religious background, and also with more secular-oriented people.<br />This is a tale of greed, selfishness, regret, redemption, family, and community, and is enlivened by some of the most memorable characters ever created for English literature. Even if Dickens had never written another word, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; would still have, I believe, secured his place as one of the great figures of world literature.	2003-03-31

Carter mixes interesting statistics with autobiographical information and practical advice.<br />Carter discusses his work and experiences with a number of organizations, such as Habitat for Humanity. He also discusses the lives of people who made extraordinary accomplishments in their senior years. Carter doesn't shy away from sensitive topics, such as senior sexuality or preparing for one's own death.<br />One admirable characteristic of Carter's writing is that while it is informed by his own Christian faith, he is also respectful of other belief traditions. Overall, he writes like an unpretentious friend who is sharing his life experience and perspective. Throughout the book, his wife Rosalynn is a constant presence; you get a real sense of the solidity of that relationship.	2003-03-30

The back cover notes that the author is a theology professor at Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The book is very much in the liberal/progressive/radical Christian tradition; Heyward cites such figures as Mohandas K. Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Desmond Tutu. At 110 pages, it's a fairly short book.<br />Heyward's words are consistently thought-provoking. She discusses many topics: the idea of a just war, the idea of loving one's enemies, the concept of God as mother, etc. She is very critical of the Bush administration and of the \\"[Jerry] Falwell-[Pat] Robertson version of Christianity.\\" Some of the most compelling material in the book deals with her involvement in a therapeutic horse riding program; ultimately she points toward a theology that more fully embraces the worth of non-human beings. Overall, a compelling work from a consistently interesting theologian.	2003-03-25

The back cover notes that the author is professor of English at Chapman University in California. This short book (78 pages) is a surreal fiction about the title character and his personal library.<br />I agree with the back cover blurb that compares this book to the work of Borges. This book is a literary hall of mirrors that explores the line between fiction and reality. Nakell's writing is very literary minded--he drops references to &quot;Hamlet,&quot; Frantz Fanon, Gertrude Stein, Herman Melville, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, and much more. He also touches on censorship, the relationship between reading and time, etc.<br />Overall, a compelling work with an appealing experimental flavor. If you enjoy it, I also recommend the following short story collections by Cristina Peri Rossi: &quot;A Forbidden Passion&quot; and &quot;The Museum of Useless Efforts.&quot;	2003-03-25

David Small is the rabbi of the synagogue in the \\"Yankee town\\" of Barnard's Crossing. As the book opens the rabbi is caught up in a political power struggle within his own congregation. But the situation gets even stickier when a crime is committed and the rabbi is drawn into the investigation. Illegal [substance] trade and racial prejudice complicate the matter.<br />This is a really fun read. Kemelman has a very engaging writing style, and the smart, stubborn Rabbi Small is a marvelous character. There is occasional dated language ...but overall the book really holds up.<br />The story offers a really intriguing look at a Jewish community and specifically at life within the synagogue. A number of interesting issues are raised--the role of the synagogue in society, the role of the rabbi, etc. A good book not only for lovers of crime fiction but also for those interested in Jewish-American studies.	2003-03-22

The main text is preceded by a publisher's note, which declares that contents of this book (my review refers to the Harvest edition published by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co.) appeared in the 1971 Polish edition of the book entitled &quot;The Star Diaries,&quot; but not in the British and American editions with the same title. Thus this book could be seen as the second volume of Lem's original Polish &quot;Star Diaries.&quot; Despite all this, I believe that this book works fine as a stand-alone literary work, so go ahead and ignore the publisher's note if you like.<br />The book is divided up into several sections, each of which could stand alone as a short story. Each piece is told in the first person by space traveler Ijon Tichy. He discusses his voyages beyond the Solar System and his encounters with an assortment of eccentric scientists on Earth.<br />&quot;Memoirs&quot; is a delightful, pungent blend of science fiction, philosophy, satire, and horror. Witty and haunting, funny and frightening, it's spiced by clever wordplay.<br />Lem deals with such topics as artificial intelligence, time travel, environmental exploitation, the nature of the human soul, and the origins of the universe. He describes many whimsical extraterrestrial species, such as the foul-tailed fetido and bottombiter chair ants. Overall, this wacky, surreal book shows Lem to be a soul brother to Edgar Allan Poe, Dr. Seuss, and Kurt Vonnegut.	2003-03-17

Lewis, is a non-fiction work that looks at the title phenomenon in a Christian theological context. The chapters in the book look at human pain, animal pain, divine omnipotence, human wickedness, and other theological/philosophical concepts.<br />I found \\"Problem\\" to be a curious book. Some parts are well-written and thought-provoking, some parts are dull. Some parts just seem self-indulgent and even silly; at its worst the book reads like an eggheaded parody of theology. The chapter on hell is particularly unsatisfying; I found it to sound patronizing and frustratingly vague at times. But the book as a whole is thankfully enlivened by delightful flashes of wit.<br />Theologically, Lewis seems to be at odds with strict biblical literalism; in chapter 5 he appears to endorse the idea of biological evolution, for example. Despite my reservations, I feel that this is a worthwhile book for both Christians and those of other belief traditions.	2003-03-17

This volume opens in the mid 1960s as Angelou returns to the United States from Africa with the intention of working with Malcolm X. The narrative follows Maya's life in Hawaii, California, and New York.<br />Maya reflects on her work as a stage performer and aspiring writer, and reminisces about her relationships with her son, her mother, and her friends. The book is really fascinating as it tells of her relationships and encounters with many noteworthy people: Martin Luther King Jr., Nichelle Nichols, Rosa Guy, and others. The author paints a particularly warm and moving portrait of the great writer and activist James Baldwin.<br />&quot;Song&quot; continues to explore many of the important themes of her other books, such as the relationship between Africans and African-Americans. Angelou does a good job of capturing intimate human relationships and placing them in the context of great movements in history. The book also looks at the genesis of her celebrated book &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.&quot;<br />This is a well-written, very engaging book; I read all 212 pages in literally a single evening. I recommend as companion texts to this wonderful book the following: the previous volumes of Angelou's autobiography, the essays of James Baldwin, the autobiography of Malcolm X, Audre Lorde's &quot;Zami,&quot; and any good collection of King's essays and speeches.	2003-03-04

It is a world of total regimentation; there is virtually no privacy or freedom. The people have numbers rather than names. The story of this bizarre world is told in the first person by a builder assigned to construct a space ship. He offers a chilling view of the OneState.<br />&quot;We&quot; is an intriguing work of science fiction that is full of striking visual imagery. Zamyatin's prose, as translated by Brown, has a surreal, dreamlike quality. The book reminds me somewhat of Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World,&quot; although I found &quot;We&quot; to be less bitingly satiric.	2003-03-01

This is a new edition with revised translation; the introductory material notes that the revision occurred after the death of 'Ali.<br />Not knowing Arabic myself, I can't comment on the accuracy of the translation. But 'Ali's version has a stately, classic quality. There are passages of real majesty and poetic grace. The translator uses archaic terms like \\"thou\\" and \\"verily,\\" but I think they have a poetic effect and don't hurt this version's readability.<br />'Ali's footnotes are admittedly one-sided; they are written from an explicitly Muslim perspective, rather than a neutral or interfaith standpoint. Still, the footnotes are often very informative, even fascinating, as he puts passages in context and discusses theological and linguistic points.<br />Regarding the Qur'an itself: because it is a sacred text to over a billion people and has had such a profound impact on world history, I assert that it is essential reading for any person, regardless of religious belief, who wants to be an educated citizen of the world. The Qur'an has an epic quality. It is an intriguing mix of poetic ecstasy and down-to-earth concerns.<br />The Qur'an is an intensely self-conscious text; it constantly refers to itself, asserting its claim of divine origin and claiming a relationship to older divine revelation. Those familiar with Jewish and Christian scriptures will find the stories of familiar figures (Abraham, Moses, Jesus, etc.) retold in the Qur'an, but often with a twist.<br />If you aren't a scholar of the Arabic language, I recommend you supplement your reading of 'Ali's version with other translations of the Qur'an; I would recommend A.J. Arberry's in particular. For intriguing companion texts to the Qur'an; try the Book of Mormon, the \\"Autobiography of Malcolm X,\\" and the texts of the Baha'i religion.f Malcolm X,\\" and the texts of the Baha'i religion.	2003-02-26

The book tells the story of Sam Damon, a Nebraska man who enlists in the Army and gradually rises up the ranks; his career spans a great portion of the 20th century. His story is intertwined with that of his rival, fellow soldier Courtney Massengale. The men are polar opposites: Damon is a down-to-earth guy who genuinely cares about his soldiers, whereas Massengale is a cold, ruthless puppetmaster with grand dreams of power and conquest.<br />Myrer brilliantly focuses his vast story on these two archetypal characters. In the end he creates a sweeping tapestry into which he weaves many relevant issues: leadership, love, marriage, racism, courage, politics, etc. He offers an intriguing look at such things as the role of military wives, officer-enlisted relations, the relationship between the military and civilian political authorities, etc.<br />The book is full of memorable characters, vivid scenes, and powerful dialogue. Myrer has a real skill at descriptive writing. Ultimately, this is a novel of ideas which never loses touch of the humanity (or inhumanity) of its characters. I especially liked the fact that Myrer creates compelling female, as well as male, characters.<br />It's really like an epic TV mini-series in book form. Recommended as companion texts: &quot;A Narrative of a Revolutionary Soldier,&quot; by Joseph Plumb Martin, &quot;Bridges at Toko-Ri,&quot; by James Michener, and &quot;Starship Troopers,&quot; by Robert Heinlein. All are excellent books in particular for military leaders, or for anyone with an interest in the military.	2003-02-23

Solomon, is a wonderful anthology of stories. The selections in the book are grouped by geographic region into 5 sections, each containing 5 stories. The regions represented are Africa, China, India, Japan, and Latin America. In her introduction, Solomon notes that all of the stories are written by major authors who had published fiction after World War II.<br />The group of 25 authors is full of noteworthy names: Chinua Achebe, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Jorge Luis Borges, and more. The themes in the anthology include love, marriage, parenthood, oppressive governments, art, religion, economic struggle, ideological conflict, and cultural dislocation. The modes range from fantasy to stark reality--there is violence and serenity, beauty and grotesqueness, sorrow and humor.<br />I especially loved the Chinese stories, which give a vivid portrayal of life under the Communist regime--it's like a real life dystopia. Other strong selections include Yukio Mishima's &quot;Acts of Worship,&quot; about a professor's pilgrimage; Isabel Allende's &quot;Clarisa,&quot; a colorful character study; and R.K. Narayan's &quot;A Horse and Two Goats,&quot; a story of cross-cultural miscommunication. Overall, I would recommend this book both as a classroom text and for individual reading. Recommended companion text: &quot;Caribbean New Wave,&quot; a short story anthology edited by Stewart Brown.	2003-02-17

A short author bio at the end of the book notes that Huynh was born in Vietnam and eventually moved to the United States. This book is a wonderful account of growing up in rural Vietnam.<br />Huynh describes his life in a village on a riverbank, with a jungle and mountains nearby. The book is divided up into several short vignettes that describe the lives of the people and animals of this world. Although the danger and violence of some sections may be upsetting to some readers, I get the sense that the author is trying to present a truthful portrait of rural life.<br />There are accounts of many interesting people, such as Huynh's opera loving, karate fighting grandmother. But I was particularly fascinated by the many accounts of the domestic and wild animals of Huynh's homeland. I loved the descriptions of animal behavior and the accounts of the interactions between animals and people, between animals of the same species, and between animals of different species. We meet monkeys, otters, a fearsome crocodile, and many other creatures. It's a rich tapestry of life that is described vividly by the author. One of the most memorable animal characters is Huynh's water buffalo, Tank, a creature of great strength, loyalty, and courage.<br />This is a wonderful book that is written in a very effective, straightforward style that is ultimately quite poignant. It's sort of like a Vietnamese response to Laura Ingalls Wilder's beloved \\"Little House\\" books. I recommend \\"The Land I Lost\\" to readers of all ages.	2003-01-19

Abbott, is a marvelous tale that I regard as a pioneering piece of science fiction. According to the introductory note in the Dover edition, Abbott was an English scholar and clergyman, and the book was first published under a pseudonym in 1884. The book is enhanced by the author's own delightful illustrations.<br />&quot;Flatland&quot; is told in the first person by an intelligent square who lives in a fantastic two-dimensional world. He describes in fascinating detail his own world of Flatland, going into such topics as architecture, war, genetics, medical arts, law, and family values. Particularly fascinating is his account of his society's rigid stratification by class and gender. The square tells of his visions of zero- and one-dimensional worlds, and of his life-changing contact with the three-dimensional world.<br />Abbott succeeds in a task attempted with varying success by generations of science fiction writers since him: he creates an alternate world which is utterly alien, yet disturbingly familiar--a world that is complete and consistently compelling. &quot;Flatland&quot; could certainly be read as a satire of Abbott's own world; parts of it are laugh-out-loud hilarious. Whimsical yet possessing a biting edge, this is a brilliantly conceived and wonderfully written book. For a companion text, try A.K. Dewdney's &quot;The Planiverse&quot; (also about contact between two- and three-dimensional worlds); also try Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; (an equally intriguing view of a stratified sci-fi culture).	2003-01-12

According to a note about Ba at the beginning of the book, she was born in the African nation of Senegal and died in 1981. The book has been translated from French by Modupe Bode-Thomas.<br />This novel is written in the form of a long letter by Ramatoulaye, a Senegalese widow, to her friend Aissatou. Ramatoulaye discusses the lives, marriages and families of both women, and reflects on their friendship. As she writes, the story of her life is fleshed out.<br />Ba has created a fascinating look at postcolonial life in the former French West Africa. This portrait is decidedly from a woman's perspective and is focused on issues that particularly impact women's lives. Ba explores a multigenerational web that links women and men together.<br />Ba's subject matter includes motherhood, marriage, religion, education, and politics. Particularly fascinating are her explorations of the role of the \\"griot\\" (described in the book's endnotes as \\"part-poet, part-musician, part-sorcerer\\") and the practice of cowrie shell divination. A key element in the book is polygamy as practiced in the Muslim African world.<br />The book deals much with women's relationships--with husbands, with children, with adult female relatives, and with friends. The book is about surviving loss and disappointment; it's also about hope and personal growth...	2003-01-12

The plays are translated into English by Carlos Bauer. The informative introduction puts these pieces into some context.<br />The first of the two pieces, &quot;The Public,&quot; is full of surreal imagery--the stage instructions call for strange sets and costumes, and the play is full of weird dialogue. One interesting part of this piece is a dialogue between &quot;Character in Bells&quot; and &quot;Character in Vine Leaves.&quot; This piece is a sort of metadrama. The Director is a character. Shakespeare's &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is mentioned, and Juliet even becomes a character in this play. This piece certainly has some colorful and imaginative elements, but overall I found it impenetrable.<br />I found &quot;Play Without a Title&quot; more satisfying as a reading text. This piece involves a play-within-a-play. The author addresses the audience directly and even argues with spectators. Once again, Shakespeare's work plays a significant role within the text. The specter of violence haunts this piece, which reminds me somewhat of Luigi Pirandello's &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author.&quot;<br />Overall, I found this pair of plays to be uneven but thought-provoking. Definitely worth reading for those interested in 20th century drama.	2003-01-08

Buck, is a short novel that takes place in Japan. The main characters are Kino, a farm boy who lives on a mountainside, and his good friend Jiya, who is the son of a fisherman. The two boys bond despite the cultural differences between the farming and fishing communities. But with the presence of a volcano and the threat of the great ocean wave of the book's title, life holds danger for these boys.<br />This is a simple but beautifully told tale. Buck's themes include courage in the face of danger, the impact of geography upon the lives of the Japanese people, and the cycles of death and life. But most of all the book is about hope and friendship. For a good companion text, try one of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books.	2003-01-08

The book is narrated in the first person by a musician who, as a member of a secret society known as &quot;the League,&quot; undertook a mystical journey. This book chronicles the narrator's quest to write the story of this pilgrimage.<br />&quot;Journey&quot; is a very &quot;writerly&quot; text; it's largely about the challenge of representing life experience as a written document. The book also deals with writing as both catharsis and as a burden, and with the larger issue of finding meaning in one's life. The book has touches of fantasy and offers intriguing glimpses at the inner workings of a secret society.<br />Hesse's prose, as translated by Rosner, has an elegant simplicity and subtle power. Recommended as companion texts: &quot;The Guys,&quot; by Anne Nelson (also about the catharsis and burden of writing); and &quot;The Sun at Night,&quot; by Roger Williamson (also deals with a secret mystical society).	2003-01-02

He crosses the border into Botswana and becomes part of the village of Golema Mundi, whose members are experimenting with new agricultural methods under the tutelage of a white Englishman named Gilbert Balfour. Makhaya quickly becomes entwined in the political and social lives of Gilbert and the villagers.<br />This book offers a fascinating look at rural African life. Head's topics include social and political change, conflict between science and traditional ways, tribalism, the role of traditional African chiefs, religion, race relations, and male-female relations.<br />Overall, a compelling story. The author bio at the beginning of the book notes that Head was herself born in South Africa and eventually was granted Botswanan citizenship. For a good companion text to this novel, try &quot;the Villagers,&quot; by Jorge Icaza.	2002-12-31

The book's subtitle pretty much describes it perfectly. The book is divided into five sections that reflect the genealogical interconnections of the British royal family. The sections cover the House of Windsor and its descendants; the Norwegian royal house (yes, one of them could inherit the British crown if some massive disaster wiped out all the Windsors and descendants); the Romanian royal family; the Yugoslavian royal family; and the Russian imperial family.<br />The interesting introduction has an overview of the British royal family and the principles of royal succession. The text overall is both informative and entertining. I loved the many pictures of the royals and their relatives: at work, at play, in formal looking poses, etc. There are wedding pics, baby pics, and pics of royals in the fancy military uniforms that seem to never go out of fashion. Mini-biographies (very brief for the more obscure individuals) accompany the pictures. Along the way are some marvelous images and curious (occasionally even scandalous!) facts.<br />This is definitely one of the most enjoyable of the many royal books I have read over the years. It's full of life. Unfortunately, the 1986 edition is (as I write this review) way out of date. But the book is still well worth exploring.	2002-12-31

Tolkien, is illustrated by Pauline Baynes. The text is a poem/song attributed to Bilbo Baggins, a character from Tolkien's fantasy epic \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and its companion volume, \\"The Hobbit.\\" The song itself is a tender, wistful message of farewell. It opens, \\"Day is ended, / dim my eyes, / but journey long / before me lies.\\"<br />The song is illustrated throughout with scenes from both \\"Lord\\" and \\"the Hobbit.\\" Fans of Tolkien's tales will recognize many familiar scenes and characters: the doorway to Bilbo's home, the wizard Gandalf, the tragic Gollum, the dragon Smaug, and more. The illustrations vary from quaint and homey to action-packed to tenderly evocative. A key at the end of the book tells the origin of each scene illustrated. Bayne's pictures are full of color, charm, and interesting detail; I really believe this is a book one can come back to again and again.	2002-12-28

The short author bio on the book's opening page notes that Mahfouz was born in Cairo, has received the Nobel Prize in literature, and \\"is the most prominent author of Arabic fiction published in English today.\\"<br />This novel takes place during the \\"Infitah,\\" an \\"open-door\\" economic policy in place under Egyptian President Sadat. The story is told in alternating first-person chapters by three characters: Muhtashimi Zayed, a retired old man; his grandson Elwan; and Elwan's fiancee, Randa. Both Elwan's and Randa's families face economic troubles, and the young couple faces uncertainty regarding their own future.<br />This novel is a fascinating look at modern Egyptian family life. I found it interesting that while the book deals with three generations of Egyptians, it is only characters from the youngest and oldest generations that actually \\"speak\\" directly to the reader. Mahfouz looks at the issues of gender, economics, religious faith, and family ties in the lives of these two families and the larger community. I was particularly moved by Mahfouz's portrayal of the old man's spiritual life; Muhtashimi Zayed is a Muslim in whose life the Quran is an important element. I was also intrigued by Mahfouz's exploration of the challenges faced by the modern young Arab woman, caught between contemporary ideals and traditionalism. Overall, a compelling multigenerational portrait.	2002-12-08

The introduction by Roger Lea MacBride notes that the text was discovered as a manuscript among the real-life Laura's papers, and was not published as a book until after the deaths of both Laura and her daughter Rose.<br />As the story opens in 1885, Laura agrees to marry Manly and help him try to make a living farming. Manly quotes the Irish saying, \\"Everything is evened up in the world. The rich have their ice in the summer but the poor get theirs in the winter\\"; this saying recurs throughout the story. The young family eventually grows with the birth of baby Rose.<br />\\"First Four\\" offers lots of details about farm economics and daily farm activities. The pioneering family faces much adversity: sickness, the harsh climate, and more. Wilder presents the often deadly dangers of pioneer life quite frankly; I don't believe that this is a sugar-coated portrayal.<br />There are some dark and troubling moments along the way, but ultimately I found this book to be joyful and hopeful. Wilder celebrates the courage and tenacity of the pioneer farm family.	2002-12-08

The book also includes an introduction by Norris Houghton, who notes, among other things, that WSS is based on R&amp;J. Each text tells the story of a love affair between a young woman and a young man who are caught between warring factions.<br />I find it stimulating and useful to have these two pieces, linked in theme but separated by centuries, together in one volume. Each is a great text on its own, but having them together may help the reader to see each piece in a different light. One of the things I find most striking as one moves from R&amp;J to WSS is how the latter text adds the element of ethnic tension to the fundamental story of &quot;star-crossed lovers.&quot;<br />R&amp;J is more than just a classic piece of literature; it's also a touchstone of pop culture (hey, it's even been incorporated into a &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; episode!). Despite the passage of centuries, I find Shakespeare's portrayal of the joy and pain of forbidden love to remain relevant and compelling. And R&amp;J holds up as a reader's text, even with the availability of filmed versions. I think that WSS, being a musical play, naturally loses some impact as a text strictly on the page, but nevertheless I found it a rewarding reader's text also. One might try listening to a CD of WSS's songs as an accompaniment to reading the text.<br />To supplement WSS's portrayal of urban Puerto Ricans, I recommend that interested readers seek out some writings by &quot;Nuyorican&quot; authors; to start with, try Roberto Santiago's illuminating anthology &quot;Boricuas: Influential Puerto Rican Writings.&quot;	2002-12-05

Ralph finds himself in conflict with both the nagging older generation of mice and the annoying younger group; he longs for \\"a life of speed and danger and excitement.\\" So he sets off on his mouse-sized motorcycle and has an adventure in which he encounters many new people, animals, and situations.<br />\\"Ralph\\" is a fun adventure story that is filled with humor and suspense. Cleary includes well-written characters and many clever details as Ralph's journey progresses. An important aspect of the novel is Ralph's ability to talk to both other animals (of various species) and certain humans. This fantasy element of the book, similar to the communication in the classic story \\"Charlotte's Web,\\" is skillfully handled by Cleary.<br />Ralph is a great character. Despite his personal flaws, his essential courage and resourcefulness make him admirable. I see Ralph as a questing hero in the mold of such classic characters as Homer's Odysseus or Cervantes' Don Quixote. Finally, for an interesting companion text to \\"Ralph,\\" try Felice Holman's powerful novel \\"Slake's Limbo.\\"	2002-12-05

The child of a single working mother, Victoria is sent to a boarding school called the Coburn Home School. Although she has some trouble adjusting, Victoria finds a friend in Martha, a strong-willed classmate. Martha shares with Victoria the \\"secret language\\" of the book's title.<br />Much of the book is filled with accounts of the girls' games and projects, which range in results from rewarding success to embarrassing failure. The book celebrates friendship and imagination. One interesting theme is the challenge for children to find a \\"happy medium\\" between creative individualism and social conformity. But ultimately I thought that the book gave off a strangely ambiguous message on this subject.<br />One rather disappointing aspect of the book is the \\"secret language\\" itself. It really isn't a language at all, but just a few slang words (\\"ick-en-spick,\\" \\"leebossa,\\" etc) that the girls sprinkle into their conversation. And although this \\"language\\" is hyped up in the title and opening chapters, Nordstrom seems to neglect it as the story is taken over by other elements. This virtual abandonment of the book's title phenomenon strikes me as a real missed opportunity.<br />Still, the novel does have its good points and the story held my attention throughout. Also interesting was the author bio inside the back cover: it notes that author Nordstrom was a book editor who served as director of Harper's Department of Books for Boys and Girls from 1940-1973. So her literary legacy really goes far beyond this novel. One final note: if you do know a young reader who's interested in constructed languages, I recommend you get them a good primer on Esperanto.	2002-11-27

The book tells the story of Joe, a little boy who can't swim, even though other members of his family are skillful swimmers. This makes Joe sad. However, Joe's situation takes an unexpected turn when a small frog from a nearby pond becomes trapped in Joe's swimming pool.<br />This is a moving story that's told with charm and compassion. Both Joe and \\"Frog\\" are wonderful characters with whom I could really identify. The full-color illustrations really complement their story well; Browne does a particularly nice job of capturing the play of light in water. And together with Cooper she creates a very satisfying conclusion to the mildly suspenseful story. A sweet and uplifting book, \\"Frog\\" is a winner.	2002-11-27

Although different characters appear in each tale, the collection as a whole is unified by style and by theme. Each story deals with an encounter or ongoing relationship between a human being and one or more non-human animals. Since the book is only 81 pages long, each tale is quite brief.<br />This is a gentle, moving book. Rylant has a gift for capturing resonant details. She also writes with great compassion for both her human and non-human characters. Her non-human characters come in many different species: a turtle, dogs, a parrot, squirrels, and more. Her human characters are also diverse: both adults and children, both male and female. I found one of the most memorable characters to be an alcoholic wartime veteran (from \\"Drying Out\\").<br />My overall favorite story in the collection, \\"A Pet,\\" is about a girl who becomes the owner of a blind old goldfish. I would recommend this book especially to those interested in the short story as a literary form and to those interested in literature about animals. If you like this book, I would also recommend Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's novel \\"Shiloh.\\"	2002-11-24

The chapters alternate between these characters' two voices. The children live with their parents in an island village; their community has a pre-industrial culture.<br />Morning Girl and her brother have the type of conflict you might expect between a sister and her sometimes annoying younger brother. This relationship is explored against the backdrop of the children's culture and the island setting. I particularly liked the character of Star Boy: he's experiencing some emotional growing pains as he yearns for respect while still engaging in some childish actions. An important theme in the book is the naming tradition of the children's culture.<br />Dorris writes in a clear, poetic prose style that is touched by a mystical element. And don't miss the startling epilogue which pulls the whole story into focus.	2002-11-24

The book includes a preface by Tupac's mother, Afeni Shakur; a foreword by poet Nikki Giovanni; and an introduction by Leila Steinberg, who acted as Tupac's manager. Afeni Shakur notes that the poems in this book were written from 1989-91. Steinberg recalls how Tupac shared poems in a writing circle that she hosted.<br />The poems appear in this book as photos of handwritten text, with the typed transcriptions on facing pages. This format, combined with some photos of the author, adds to the visual appeal of the book.<br />Tupac's poems are about love, friendship, loss, social protest, personal goals, and disappointment. His poems touch on many moods: sadness, ecstasy, anger, pride, and hope. Along the way he cites Nelson Mandela, Huey P. Newton, and other figures.<br />I was particularly struck by &quot;Only 4 the Righteous,&quot; a witty and funny poem about rapping; this piece has a great rhyme and rhythm. &quot;The Shining Star Within!,&quot; dedicated to Marilyn Monroe, and &quot;Starry Night,&quot; dedicated to Vincent Van Gogh, are intriguing tributes to artists whom Tupac describes as ill-treated by society. &quot;God&quot; is a moving profession of faith. I was also moved by &quot;Nothing Can Come Between us,&quot; a free verse poem on friendship. &quot;Jada&quot; is one of his best love poems (&quot;u R my Heart in Human Form&quot;).<br />Overall, these poems seem to reveal many facets of the author. In &quot;For Mrs. Hawkins,&quot; he writes &quot;I'm a Panther / with the blood of Malcolm in my veins.&quot; Other poems look at racism and poverty. But he also writes about things like &quot;First Date Jitters&quot; (in &quot;1st Impressions&quot;). In &quot;What Can I Offer Her?&quot; his voice is full of longing and self-doubt; it is one of many poems that show an emotional vulnerability.<br />I'm not familiar with Tupac's rap and film work, so I may have approached these poems with fewer preconceptions than some readers. Overall, I think this is a valuable volume. Steinberg notes in her intro that she's used Tupac's writings as teaching tools; I believe that &quot;The Rose That Grew from Concrete&quot; could stimulate some solid classroom work.e of many poems that show an emotional vulnerability.<br />I'm not familiar with Tupac's rap and film work, so I may have approached these poems with fewer preconceptions than some readers.

Half St. Bernard and half \\"Scotch shepherd dog,\\" Buck is a huge, powerful dog who lives an idyllic existence on a magnificent estate \\"in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley.\\" But the gold rush of 1897 has created a demand for working dogs. Early in the book's first chapter, Buck is betrayed, stolen, and sold into service in the frozen wilderness of the far north. The story follows his adventures and his relationships with both humans and other canines as he travels across this harsh new world.<br />The copyright page of the Dover edition notes that \\"Call\\" was published in book form back in 1903. It is a bold, rousing adventure story. Buck is a magnificent hero who evoked both my sympathy and my admiration as I followed his odyssey. He's a likeable but noble beast: truly one of American literature's great characters. London has filled Buck's world with a fascinating and diverse group of supporting characters (both man and beast). London's prose style is a pleasure to read: solid and muscular, yet with a subtly poetic, even mythic, flavor.<br />\\"Call\\" could be read as a straightforward adventure story, or perhaps as a parable of the human condition. Either way, London draws an intriguing contrast between the polite ways of society and the harsh \\"law of club and fang.\\" This is a story full of adventure, violence, love, loss, and discovery. Both heartbreaking and uplifting, \\"The Call of the Wild\\" is, in my view, a true classic. Recommended as companion texts: Ernest Hemingway's \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" (another great adventure tale) and Phyllis Reynold Naylor's \\"Shiloh\\" (another profoundly moving dog story).	2002-11-19

The novel is full of colorful characters, weird locales, and imaginatively conceived alien species.<br />The story's hero is freighter captain Nathan Brazil, a human male who is noted to be a maverick and a loner in \\"an age of extreme conformity.\\" While carrying a motley collection of passengers on his ship, Brazil answers a distress call. Soon he finds himself on the Well World, a bizarre planet divided up into hundreds of biospheres and home to hundreds of different civilizations. Oh, and each newcomer to the planet can expect to find him- or herself transformed into a different species! \\"Midnight\\" charts the odyssey of Brazil, his allies, and his enemies across this strange and wondrous world as they seek the answer to an ancient mystery.<br />\\"Midnight\\" is a novel of ideas as well as a fun and exciting adventure; Chalker deals with such issues as history, drug addiction, crime, social organization, literacy, and more as the story unfolds. Chalker cleverly delves into the life cycles and sexual behaviors of the various Well World species, which include intelligent plants, a centaur-like race, and many more. The motif of transformation, including gender-changing, is intriguingly handled throughout the story.<br />Chalker makes reference to \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" at one point in the book, but the book, curiously, reminds me more of L. Frank Baum's classic Oz tales. And Chalker's vision of science, civilization, and history reminds me a bit of a less horrific, more light-hearted H.P. Lovecraft. Overall, a lot of fun, and written in a very engaging prose style. If you like this book, try \\"Lord Valentine's Castle,\\" by Robert Silverberg.	2002-11-12

The Dover Thrift Edition contains an introductory note on the life of Tagore, who lived from 1861 to 1941. According to this note, Tagore, who wrote poetry in Bengali, translated \\"Gitanjali\\" himself into English. The Dover edition also contains a 1912 introduction by William Butler Yeats.<br />This English version of \\"Gitanjali\\" is a series of prose poems that reflect on the interrelationships among the poet/speaker, the deity, and the world. Although Tagore had a Hindu background, the spirituality of this book is generally expressed in universal terms; I could imagine a Christian, a Buddhist, a Muslim, or an adherent of another tradition finding much in this book that would resonate with him or her.<br />The language in this book is often very beautiful. The imagery includes flowers, bird songs, clouds, the sun, etc.; one line about \\"the riotous excess of the grass\\" reminded me of Walt Whitman. Tagore's language is sensuous and sometimes embraces paradox. Like Whitman and Emily Dickinson, he sometimes seems to be resisting traditional religion and prophetically looking towards a new spirituality.<br />A sample of Tagore's style: \\"I surely know the hundred petals of a lotus will not remain closed for ever and the secret recess of its honey will be bared\\" (from section #98). As companion texts for this mystical volume I would recommend Jack Kerouac's \\"The Scripture of the Golden Eternity\\" and Juan Mascaro's translation of the Dhammapada.	2002-11-02

The Dover version is translated into English by George Young. An introductory note states that the play was first performed in the 440s BCE.<br />The introductory note also includes a brief summary of events leading up to the events of this play. &quot;Antigone&quot; concerns the family of Oedipus, former ruler of the city-state of Thebes. As &quot;Antigone&quot; opens, Thebes is ruled by Creon, the brother-in-law of Oedipus. Creon is at odds with his niece, Antigone, because he denies a proper burial to Antigone's brother Polynices. Antigone's intention to defy her uncle sets this tragedy in motion.<br />This is a powerful story about familial duty, social customs, gender roles, and the relationship between the individual and governmental authority. The issues in this play remain relevant today, and are powerfully argued by Sophocles' characters. At the heart of the play is this question: Is it right to disobey a law or edict that one feels is unjust?<br />But &quot;Antigone&quot; is not just a philosophical meditation; it's also the story of a very personal clash between two strong-willed members of a very troubled extended family. A bonus in the play is the appearance of the seer Tiresias: it is a small but potent role. Overall, this play is a solid example of why ancient Greek drama has stood the test of time.	2002-10-23

The cover and title page boast that the book contains 92 plates showing over 950 costumes from the Middle Ages to 1800. The copyright page notes that this book is a selection of plates from the 6-colume \\"Le Costume Historique\\" published in 1888.<br />Depicted are costumes from France, Spain, Italy, Russia, and other nations. Many different types of people are depicted: soldiers, clergymen, nuns, noblewomen, peasants, etc. The plates of military dress are particularly interesting; in addition to showing knights' armor and other clothing, the illustrations also show many different weapons. Horses in regalia are shown in addition to human figures. Also depicted are musical instruments.<br />The pictures include both individual figures and scenes depicting costumed figures in social interaction. Some famous people, like Elizabeth I of England, are depicted. There are some really colorful and ornate items, like elaborate ladies' headdresses. I really liked the illustrations of kilted Scotsmen. Along the way are some curious sights, such as a bizarrely dressed and masked Venetian penitent. Overall, this book is a marvelous and educational visual feast.	2002-10-23

The book is part of a trio of anthologies of 10-minute plays; one of the other anthologies collects plays for 2 actors, and the third collects plays for 4, 5, or 6 actors.<br />This volume begins with a short introduction that discusses the 10-minute play as a genre. The plays in this anthology are further subdivided into 5 categories: plays for 3 men (3 plays), plays for 3 women (6), plays for 2 men and 1 woman (9), plays for 2 women and 1 man (11), and finally, a single play with gender variability.<br />As a group these plays demonstrate a variety of dramatic techniques and have a diverse assortment of different characters. The plays deal with many different issues: gender relations, ethnic and national identity, violence, ethics, socioeconomic issues, loss, love, superstition, and more. A few of my favorite plays in this book are as follows:<br />\\"Tango Delta,\\" by Jeffrey Hatcher: about 3 secret service agents on a rooftop mission. \\"Eating Out,\\" by Marcia Dixcy: 3 women talk about their eating disorders. \\"Sunday Go to Meetin',\\" by Shirley Lauro: A Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrant girl experiences a cultural clash in 1905. \\"Cover,\\" by Jeffrey Sweet: explores the ethics of lying. \\"Lunchtime,\\" by Rob Marcato: about a tense encounter in a public eating area. And \\"Arabian Nights,\\" by David Ives: an absurdist comedy about language and interpretation.<br />This is an impressive collection. My only complaint is that there are no author bios (although the brief overall intro notes that these plays are written by American playwrights). A brief sentence or two about each contributor would have, in my opinion, added both interest and educational value to the anthology. Still, it's an excellent volume in a fine trilogy of anthologies.	2002-10-21

The book begins with a historical note in which Osborne describes the background of her tale. In 1848, a heroic firefighter character first began appearing in stage productions. This character was based on a real-life New York City firefighter named Mose Humphreys. In 1915, historian Herbert Asbury included some Mose stories in two collections of stories about old New York. As Osborne observes, firefighter Mose is \\"America's first urban folk hero.\\"<br />Osborne's story takes place in a past era where newsboys sold papers for a penny each. The story's hero is Mose, an eight foot tall firefighter with superhuman strength. Sample text: \\"'Come on boys!' said Mose. Mose was the most famous firefighter in New York City.\\"<br />The story is well enhanced by colorful illustrations that are full of great details. There are some exciting firefighting scenes, as well as some nice pictures of Mose engaged in less dangerous pursuits (such as eating a hearty meal).<br />The book has the following dedication: \\"To the memory of the 343 New York City firefighters who gave their lives to save others on September 11, 2001.\\" It's a beautiful tribute that I recommend to readers of all ages.	2002-10-16

According to the introductory note in the Dover edition, the play was first presented in 1613 or 1614.<br />The title character is a widow with two brothers: Ferdinand and the Cardinal. In the play's opening act, the brothers try to persuade their sister not to seek a new husband. Her resistance to their wishes sets in motion a chain of secrecy, plotting, and violence.<br />The relationship between Ferdinand and the Duchess is probably one of the most unsettling brother-sister relationships in literature. The play is full of both onstage killings and great lines. The title character is one of stage history's intriguing female characters; she is a woman whose desires lead her to defy familial pressure. Another fascinating and complex character is Bosola, who early in the play is enlisted to act as a spy. Overall, a compelling and well-written tragedy.	2002-10-12

The book brings together plays from 13th and 14th century China. The contents are as follows: &quot;The Orphan of Chao,&quot; a revenge story by Chi Chun-hsiang; &quot;The Soul of Ch'ien-nu Leaves her Body,&quot; a paranormal love story by Cheng Teh-hui; &quot;The Injustice Done to Tou Ngo,&quot; a supernatural story of injustice by Kuan Han-ch'ing; &quot;Chang Boils the Sea,&quot; a magical love story by Li Hao-ku; &quot;Autumn in Han Palace,&quot; a political love story by Ma Chih-yuan; and the anonymous &quot;A Stratagem of Interlocking Rings,&quot; a story of political intrigue.<br />Throughout this anthology, I was reminded of the popular film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,&quot; which also evokes a long-ago era of Chinese history. Many of these plays also reminded me at times of Shakespearean drama. These plays are richly populated with a diverse body of human characters: lovers, villains, emperors, warriors, court officials, and more. There are also a number of supernatural characters such as a Taoist immortal and the Divine Dragon King. Liu Jung-en's English versions of these plays are beautifully written, and contain some really poetic language.<br />This anthology's marvelous mix of courtly intrigue, romance, magic, folkloric elements, and tragedy is really stunning. Together, these plays constitute an enchanting body of literature. I recommend this collection both for literature classes and for individual readers.	2002-10-12

In the book's beginning, the family is visited by a very curious character called Mrs. Whatsit. So begins an interplanetary science fiction adventure that will radically impact not only Meg, but her entire family.<br />Together with Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Childhood's End\\" and the short stories of Isaac Asimov, this book was definitely one of the sci-fi masterpieces that most impacted me as a young person. And re-reading it many years later, I can say that \\"Wrinkle\\" remains a vital and enchanting piece of literature. While clearly in the sci-fi genre, the book has a fantasy flavor which only adds to its appeal.<br />L'Engle's masterful descriptive language really brings to life the marvelous alien beings and other sights which our heroes encounter on their quest. \\"Wrinkle\\" is a very intelligent and literary book. Although L'Engle draws on the language of Christian theology in the creation of her fictional universe, her vision is inclusive and multicultural.<br />Ultimately, it is the philosophical underpinning of this classic that is as gripping as the book's imaginative flourishes. \\"Wrinkle\\" is a cry against totalitarianism and a celebration of diversity; it's a book that says that those who are seen as different, as outsiders, have a special part to play in the grand scheme of things. Definitely recommended for both young people and older readers.	2002-10-06

The brief introduction to this version notes that the play was first published in 1604, and also discusses its relationship to a German text from 1587 known as the \\"Faustbuch.\\" In his play Marlowe tells the story of the title character, a scholar who is \\"swollen with cunning.\\" Faust dabbles in the dark arts of \\"magicians / And necromantic books,\\" and literally makes a deal with the devil. These actions drive the tragedy forward.<br />This play is a curious mixture of Christian theology, tragedy, slapstick comedy, and colorful pageantry. It moves along fast, and contains some really beautiful and stately language.<br />\\"Dr. Faustus\\" is ultimately a cautionary tale about human pride and ambition. I must admit that in the end I find it less satisfying than some of the other great tragedies of the Elizabethan era, perhaps because this play relies less on universal human issues than on a culturally-bound theological contrivance. Still, it's a noteworthy play that, I believe, still holds relevance for contemporary audiences. ...	2002-10-06

The opening pages note that the play was first performed at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough in 1998, and was then presented in London in 1999. A brief author bio notes that the London-born Ayckbourn has had a distinguished career in the British theater.<br />The book version's back cover notes that this play takes place &quot;in the forseeable future.&quot; In this future world human actors have apparently been replaced by acting robots known as &quot;actoids,&quot; which are programmed by technical specialists. Early in the play a young writer named Alan meets an actoid in whom he sees a potential for comedy. Alan's plans, and his relationship with his robotic protegee, drive the plot forward and complicate the lives of many characters.<br />This is a funny and thought-provoking play that combines comedy and mild suspense. Ayckbourn offers a fascinating glimpse at a culture which, because of the presence of human-like robots, has evolved its own set of new social protocols and prejudices. Clever dialogue and well-written characters further add to the impact of this entertaining, and surprisingly moving, text.	2002-10-06

Elric lives in a world of magic and warfare; it's a place where humans have dealings with powerful supernatural beings.<br />This is a decidedly adult fantasy story; Elric's is a world of drugs and slavery, and this story is dark, violent, and full of political intrigue. Moorcock succeeds in giving the story an evocative, mythic feel. The author has created, in addition to Elric, some really memorable characters (such as Doctor Jest, the master torturer). The book is full of wonderfully cinematic scenes and skillfully realized fantasy concepts. And the melancholy Elric makes for an interestingly offbeat hero.<br />Ultimately, \\"Elric\\" is about such resonant issues as love, ambition, responsibilty, and the seeming pull of destiny. For a compelling companion text, try Ursula K. LeGuin's \\"A Wizard of Earthsea.\\"	2002-10-05

The opening commentary on the text notes that this play dates back to 411 BCE. Aristophanes tells the story of his title character, an Athenian woman who, weary of war, conceives a bold plan: she enlists the women of Greece to refuse to have sex with their men until the men make peace.<br />The plot of this play is thus quite simple, but it is marvelously handled by the author. The play is a rich and effective mix of slapstick antics, bawdy wordplay, and biting sociopolitical commentary. At the center of this enjoyable play is the commanding figure of Lysistrata. Articulate and resolute, she is truly one of the great characters of world drama; she's a woman with a bold vision.<br />Although it is a funny comedy, \\"Lysistrata\\" does deal with some serious issues that remain relevant after all these centuries. Recommended as a companion text: \\"Necessary Targets,\\" a play by Eve Ensler. This non-comedic drama also deals with the issue of women in a country at war.	2002-10-05

A mini-bio declares that the author is a Montreal resident. The play itself takes place in a country house in Quebec.<br />In this play, three sisters have come together at their mother's home after the death of their mother. The mother, Rose, appears as a character; the production notes state that she \\"is an integral part of their story; she is not simply a memory, or a ghost, but a vibrant character with her own story to tell and her own journey to make.\\" A fifth character is the local handyman.<br />As the three sisters spend time with each other and with the handyman, they explore the past and learn more about their mother and about each other. Although a bit soap opera-ish at times, this play is ultimately moving and effective. A key theme is finding one's self and one's way in the world. If you like plays that feature interactions between compelling female characters, I recommend \\"Very Heaven.\\" For an interesting companion text with some similar aspects, try \\"Behsharam,\\" a play by Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti.	2002-10-03

This volume tells the story of a young girl who is taken as a child to be the priestess of the ancient cult of the Nameless Ones. But her world is shaken up when her underground tunnels are visited by an unexpected intruder: Ged, the wizard-hero of the first Earthsea book.<br />I didn't think that \\"Tombs\\" was as much fun as \\"A Wizard of Earthsea,\\" the first book in the series; there is less magic, less color, and less adventure. Much of the story is gloomy and dark, like its setting. Still, it's a compelling story. There are a number of significant themes and motifs: imprisonment, enslavement, personal loss, religious faith, supernatural power, and ancient mystery. Particularly intriguing is LeGuin's portrayal of conflict between two strong female characters.	2002-10-03

After more than two millennia, this remains a powerfully written human tragedy. The Dover Thrift edition features an English translation by Rex Warner; this very effective translation manages to sound both classic and contemporary at the same time.<br />&quot;Medea&quot; tells a story involving the classical Greek hero Jason and Medea, by whom he has fathered two children. As the play opens, Jason has angered Medea by taking on another woman to be his wife. This conflict drives the drama forward. &quot;Medea&quot; is a gripping story about love, parenthood, politics, betrayal, anger, and revenge. There is a subtle but fascinating theme of ethnic tension as Medea and Jason clash. Finally, I believe that, after all these centuries, Euripedes' sociological and psychological insights remain compelling.	2002-10-03

The Dover Thrift Edition version is translated by Edwin Bjorkman. A brief introductory note states that the play first appeared as a printed text in 1888, a year before its first staging.<br />The play's title character is bold and flirtatious; her behavior, unsurprisingly, leads to controversy. \\"Miss Julie\\" is a fascinating glimpse at a society that is rigidly ordered around class stratification, gender roles, and sexual conduct; the play looks at the consequences when people resist this rigid order. The play has some really startling, thought-provoking dialogue.<br />Recommended companion texts: \\"Hands Around,\\" by Arthur Schnitzler; \\"Daisy Miler,\\" by Henry James; and \\"Cuckoos,\\" by Giuseppe Manfridi.

And finally, \\"Chook Chook,\\" by Fiona Farrell: four actors portray hens in a large chicken coop.<br />This is a very diverse group of plays that ranges from the comic to the tragic, from the surreal and allegorical to the realistic. \\"Playlunch\\" is a superb celebration of both New Zealander creativity and the short play genre; I would recommend this book for college courses, for reading groups, or just for individual reading.	2002-10-01

The opening pages of the book version note that the play was first performed in the UK in 2001. The back cover notes that Bhatti has written for television and radio, and that \\"Behsharam\\" is her first play.<br />The play opens in 1998 with Jaspal, a young Indian woman, doing her cabaret act--a sort of Karen Carpenter tribute/impersonation. Her sister Sati comes to visit her. With the third scene, the time frame shifts to 1994, where we learn more of the sister' dysfunctional 3-generation family.<br />\\"Behsharam\\" is a fascinating and moving play. An interracial Black/Indian romance is an important element in the play; the dialogue also deals with Black/Indian relations in the UK on a broader level. One character is a frustrated poet, and his situation is an interesting counterpoint to Jaspal's artistic aspirations. Although the dysfunctional family element gets a bit shrill at times, ultimately I found this material very effective. This play is a solid exploration of creativity, the cult of celebrity, family dynamics, gender issues, and multiethnic life in the UK.	2002-10-01

The Dover edition is a republication of an anonymous translation. The back cover data notes that the play was first staged in 1883.<br />&quot;Enemy&quot; tells the story of Dr. Thomas Stockmann, a medical officer for his town's public baths. When he discovers that the baths are contaminated and pose a health hazard, he is led into conflict with his brother Peter, who is the town's mayor. The tension increases as the drama moves towards its conclusion.<br />&quot;Enemy&quot; is an intriguing piece of literature. While reading it I was struck by how similar the story is to that of the classic film &quot;Jaws&quot;: in both stories, a political leader is at odds with an idealistic public servant who is concerned about a danger involving public waters!<br />The play contains much thought-provoking dialogue. Ibsen looks at the interrelationships among politicians, the press, science, and the general public. His characters question issues of truth, authority, and majority rule. Dr. Stockmann begins as a noble character, but I thought he becomes too over-the-top and in some scenes is reduced to a shrill, dogmatic cartoon (especially when he delivers a bizarre rant about poodles and hens). I honestly wasn't sure what Ibsen was trying to accomplish in some of the doctor's more outrageous dialogue.<br />Still, &quot;Enemy&quot; remains a compelling piece of art. For an intriguing companion text, try &quot;Inherit the Wind,&quot; by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, which has some similar themes and motifs.	2002-10-01

The play has been translated from the French by the author. The action of the play is simple: a pair of characters named Vladimir and Estragon are by a tree along a road where they are waiting for someone named Godot. As they wait they encounter Pozzo, his pathetic slave Lucky, and a boy.<br />There are many hints in the dialogue about theological questions; this theme starts early in the play with a discussion about a seeming inconsistence in the 4 Christian gospels. Other biblical references and allusions follow.<br />This play is bizarre and at times absurd, but also sad and haunting. Beckett seems to be exploring the ideological and psychological conflicts of the 20th century: faith versus nihilism, fellowship and compassion versus callousness and cruelty. But ultimately I think any simple attempt at summing up will not due the text justice.	2002-09-30

No translator is credited for this edition. According to the note at the start of the book, the play was initially presented by the Moscow Art Theatre in 1904.<br />The play takes place on the estate of Madame Ranevsky, the matriarch of an aristocratic Russian family that has fallen on financial hard times. She faces the possible loss of her family's magnificent cherry orchard.<br />The play is populated with interesting characters: Lopakhin, a wealthy neighbor whose father was the serf of Madame Ranevsky's father; Firs, an aged servant who longs for the &quot;old days&quot;; Trophimof, a student with lofty ideas; and more. There is a great deal of conflict among the characters.<br />&quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; is about people dealing with very personal conflicts and crises while larger socioeconomic changes are going on around them. The orchard of the title is a memorable image that is well handled by Chekhov. The play contains some really effective dialogue, such as old Firs' reflection on the apparently lost art of making dried cherries. This is definitely one classic play that remains compelling.	2002-09-30

She wrote a 600-page play about the French Revolution. Gems herself edited the play down to a manageable length, and it was produced in 1985. But Stanislawa herself continued to haunt Gems, and the result is this intriguing play.<br />The opening pages of the book note that the play was first performed in early 1998, toured the UK for 6 weeks, and had its London premiere in December 1998. The play takes place in Stanislawa's wretched, cold little wooden hut, where she is working on her epic play. As she works on the play, she is visited by both her family members and by figures from the Fench Revolutionary era.<br />The themes of this play include gender roles, the place of the artist in society, coming to terms with a problematic family background, and the human Utopian impulse. Stanislawa's fascination with the French Revolution is explored in particular. Ultimately I think the audience is left to ponder whether Stanislawa is insane, or is merely an unappreciated eccentric genius. Overall, &quot;The Snow Palace&quot; is a biting, often painful look at female intellectualism and female artistic creativity in a cold (literally) world that doesn't seem to understand.	2002-09-30

The easy-to-read text opens, \\"In an African rain forest called Inisa, lived two boys, Ade and Tayo. Best friends they were.\\" The friends have an adventure which, as the title hints, involves a startling encounter with a huge water snake.<br />This book features some really beautiful illustrations: the colorful African clothing, bright green foliage of the rain forest, purple berries, etc. Ultimately, it presents commendable messages about loyalty, courage, and the danger of irresponsibility.	2002-09-29

The title page notes that the play was first performed in London in 2000.<br />The opening sections of the play have an ominous, Twilight Zone-ish flavor; there is a mix of surreal, absurdist imagery with dialogue about death and violence. The play opens with Joan, a girl who is staying at the home of her aunt, Harper. But as the two talk, it becomes clear that something secret and very disturbing is happening on Harper's property.<br />There is some really weird dialogue in this play. Sample: \\"Mallards are not a good waterbird. They commit rape, and they're on the side of the elephants and the Koreans.\\" I don't think that the final section of the play quite sustains the imaginatively nightmarish quality of the opening parts, and I found the ending somewhat abrupt; but still, \\"Far Away\\" is a remarkable text from a noteworthy theatrical voice.	2002-09-29
1393930:US	51987970	R3R0OKEHP9SBZY	0413733106	477236326	An Experiment With An Air Pump (Modern Plays)	Books	5	10	11	N	N	She blinded me with science	&quot;An Experiment with an Air Pump,&quot; by Shelagh Stephenson, is an intriguing play that takes place in two different time periods: 1799 and 1999. The book notes that the play was first performed at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester in 1998; a biographic note on the author states that she was born in Northumberland and has written a number of plays for BBC Radio.<br />The play switches back and forth between the two time periods. The 1799 story is about scientist and political radical Joseph Fenwick, his family, servant, and professional associates. The 1999 story looks at a married couple in which the wife is a scientist, and at 2 of their associates. The intent is for four of the actors to double and each play one character in each time period.<br />&quot;Experiment&quot; makes use of a play-within-a-play motif as some of the 1799 characters work on mounting a little production. There's also a tip of the hat to the epistolary novel as letters between two characters are read as part of the dialogue. Some of the issues addressed in the play are gender roles, creativity, class oppression, &quot;Englishness&quot; (i.e. English ethnic/national identity), cross-cultural contact, the role of the scientist in society, scientific ethics, and female beauty standards. There are some really cutting lines as the characters explore these issues. Complex and thought-provoking, this is a really remarkable play.	2002-09-29

The published version of the play contains a short but moving introduction by Gems in which the author reflects on the life, work, and iconic status of Dietrich. The book also notes that the play was first performed in 1996 with Sian Phillips in the challenging title role.<br />As the play opens, an older Marlene is about to arrive at a theater where she is due to perform her stage act. &quot;Marlene&quot; is funny and moving. The title character is a real diva, with the larger-than-life quality which that word implies; she is also a woman of substance, passion, and wit. Much of the play consists of dialogue between Marlene and her friend/assistant, Vivian.<br />The play looks at Marlene's struggle with physical ailment and pain. Also examined is her sense of identity as a German who became a United States citizen. Moments in the play are marked where the playwright intends for songs to be performed. Overall, I found this play to be a memorable exploration of Dietrich's legacy.	2002-09-29

The introductory materials in this book note that Genet finished the play in 1948 and that it was considered lost; the text was published in France in 1993. As a stage production, it received its British premiere in 1995.<br />As the play opens, a group of gangsters known as the \\"Blaze of Glory\\" boys are trapped in a hotel which is surrounded by the police. As the tense drama plays out, the boys (and the audience) hear radio reports of the situation.<br />\\"Splendid's\\" is an intriguing drama: violent, and with elements of the ridiculous. The play deals with a number of themes: leadership, group dynamics, male homosexual desire, cross-dressing, the media portrayal of criminals, and the relationship between lawbreakers and law enforcers. Definitely a text worth reading; I'm glad it was rescued and revived.	2002-09-29

This three-act play has a copyright date of 1956, and the English translation has a copyright date of 1962.<br />This is an outrageous tale with a strong satiric flavor. The story takes place in Guellen, a European town that has fallen into economic depression and decay. As the play opens the townspeople are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Claire Zachanassian, a hometown girl who has gone on to become super-wealthy. The townspeople hope that her financial generosity will save Guellen. But from early on in the first act, Claire hints that she has a sinister, even deadly, ultimate goal.<br />This is a colorful, richly peopled dark comedy. It's full of arresting dialogue, suspense, and grotesque characters. A major theme is the tension between capitalistic greed and the Western humanistic tradition. The play is also about sex, lies, and injustice.<br />With her artificial body parts, bizarre retinue, and colorful backstory, Claire is one of the most remarkable characters in the history of drama--perhaps the most commanding female stage character since Lady Macbeth. She is charming yet sinister, grotesque yet oddly sympathetic. The creation of this character is, in my opinion, a great triumph for Durrenmatt.<br />For companion texts, I would recommend the following: \\"Rene's Flesh,\\" by Virgilio Pinera; \\"Bedside Manners,\\" by Luisa Valenzuela; and \\"The Doorman,\\" by Reinaldo Arenas. Each of these works is, in its own way, as bizarre and stimulating as \\"The Visit.\\"	2002-09-27

There are also instructions for making a Haitian-inspired Carnival headdress, as well as a recipe for the dessert known as blancmange.<br />The book explains such festivals as Carnival, Mardi Gras, Haitian Independence Day, and the Day of the Dead. A number of related topics are covered: the voodoo religion, beliefs about zombies, and the importance of Haitian heroes like Toussaint L'Ouverture. The photographs are really great: we see a statue memorializing national hero Henri Christophe, a richly decorated church interior, a colorfully decorated \\"taptap\\" (public bus), and more. Overall, a fine entry in this series.	2002-09-26

Included are a map, a short glossary, and an index.<br />The king's birthday, Walpurgis Night, Midsummer's Day, and other festivals are discussed. Related topics covered include the role of the Swedish royal family, traditional superstitions, and Viking mythology. The book describes such interesting customs as leaving out a bowl of porridge for the \\"hustomte\\" (a gnome who guards one's house), or having a sour herring party. And of course, the book discusses the traditional Swedish smorgasbord.<br />The book gives instructions on how to make a Julangel (a decorative Christmas angel), as well as a recipe for coconut chocolate balls (I haven't tried the recipe, but it sounds delicious!). Throughout the book are many colorful images: children in traditional costumes, the royal family in elegant dress, a field of beautiful daffodils, etc.	2002-09-26

The production history notes that the play received its American premiere in 1998. It's a lean four-character play; the author's note states that two of the characters (the Author and the Tiger) must be performed by the same actor.<br />The play begins with the Author recalling how, in 1952, he was a young man on a cargo steamship. His job was to be the Captain's Tiger--&quot;a sort of glorified servant.&quot; Most of the play actually takes place during this earlier period. While serving on the ship, the Tiger begins to write a novel based on the young womanhood of his Afrikaner mother. He strikes up a friendship with the Donkeyman, a Black African man who works in the engineroom. The other key relationship is between the Tiger and Betty, the main character in his novel. She literally comes to life and has some lively exchanges with the ambitious young writer.<br />This is a marvelous play. It examines what it means to be an author. Fugard looks at the relationship between the author and his characters, as well as the relationships between the author and the &quot;real&quot; people in his life. This is a coming-of-age story, a story of a friendship that overcomes a language barrier, and is also about coming to terms with painful aspects of one's past. I have never seen this piece actually performed, but I can say that it is an excellent text for reading.	2002-09-25

The back cover notes that the play was first staged in London in 1989 and was the debut production of the Tamasha Theatre Company.<br />&quot;Untouchable&quot; is the story of Bakha, a latrine cleaner in India; he is one of the &quot;untouchables&quot; and is scorned and abused under India's caste system. The place takes place during the time of Gandhi; his hunger strike on behalf of untouchable rights is an important part of the play. The play also deals with interfaith debate, ritual cleanliness, and Bakha's desire for an education. The abuses suffered by untouchables are graphically depicted.<br />Although the scenes and dialogue occasionally strike me as being a bit stiff and melodramatic, overall I found this to be a very effective and moving play. Bakha is a compelling character; he reminds me a bit of the young Frederick Douglass as depicted in &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; (which I recommend as a very relevant companion text).	2002-09-24

This edition contains an extensive, thoroughly annotated introduction by Dan Rebellato. The introduction is divided into two parts: one focusing on the life and career of British playwright Rattigan (1911-1977), and the second focusing on the play (which had its British premiere in 1952) and its production history.<br />The play itself opens shortly after a suicide attempt by its main character, Hester. As the play progresses, Hester must deal with her troubled relationships: one with her estranged husband, a judge, and one with her lover, a washed-up, heavy drinking former pilot. There are a number of supporting characters, one of whom is hinted to be a homosexual.<br />\\"The Deep Blue Sea\\" is about love, secrecy, despair, societal conventions, and the need to find a reason to live after a great turmoil in your life. The play is moving, and has strong dialogue. Particularly intriguing is the way Rattigan questions the nature of love--how the concept may be different for different people.<br />The two-part introduction offers a fascinating perspective on Rattigan's life as a homosexual man during times that included \\"a major witch-hunt\\" against gays in Britain. Rebellato also considers the actual play in a gay literary context. My suggestion, however, is that you read the introduction AFTER reading the play, since it gives away much of the plot. Overall, this is a fine edition of a play that remains compelling.	2002-09-24

The book is edited by John Willett and Ralph Manheim. Included is an introductory note entitled \\"The Lehrstuck or Learning-Play,\\" which is excerpted from an essay by Brecht. The pieces in this book, all of which were written from 1929 to 1930, are as follows:<br />\\"The Measures Taken,\\" translated by Carl R. Mueller, is the story of a group of Communist agitators from Moscow who go to spread ... in China. It's a compelling story about the conflict between idealism and doctrinal orthodoxy. \\"The Exception and the Rule,\\" translated by Ralph Manheim, is about an expedition headed by an exploitative merchant. It's a story of greed, violence, and law. \\"He Who says Yes\\" and \\"He Who Says No,\\" both translated by Wolfgang Sauerlander, are a linked pair of plays; each one tells the story of a young man's quest to get medicine for his ailing mother.<br />Overall, the plays have a very ritualized quality; three of them make use of a chorus. The stories told in these plays have the flavor of parables. Overall, I found these pieces very intriguing, particularly in a post-Cold war context.	2002-09-22

The opening pages of the book note that the play was first performed at the Traverse Theater in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 2000; also noted is the fact that the author lives in Edinburgh.<br />The play opens with Elizabeth, a contemporary woman who works as a historian and lives in a converted Victorian mansion. The people in her life include her sister Kitty, a reporter; her widowed mother Ina; her best friend Susie, a lesbian who wants to have a baby with her partner; and Callum, a New Age-y fellow who's doing work on the house. These characters deal with both their current relationships as well as with issues from the past that continue to haunt them. Their story alternates with that of a troubled family that occupied the house in the 19th century.<br />I really didn't know what to expect when I started reading this play, but by the end I really loved it. It's a full-bodied blend of tragedy and comedy; the two stories are effectively linked. Although the story is at times a bit soap opera-ish, ultimately the play as a whole is quite moving and very satisfying.<br />Some of the play's themes include romantic love, sex, societal pressure, sisterhood, infidelity, and women's desire for motherhood. The dialogue is strong, and the characters really came to life for me as I read the play. I think this would be a good book both for classes in contemporary drama and women's studies; I also recommend it for independent reading.	2002-09-22

It takes place in England.<br />This is a violent, tragic play, but it is not without moments of humor. Overall, it's a disturbing vision of human cruelty and anger; it also presents a troubling portrait of aimless, violent youth. It's grim, but moving. For a compelling companion text that touches on some common ground, try Moises Kaufman's &quot;The Laramie Project.&quot;	2002-09-22

The English version by Eric Bentley is published as a Signet Classic. The translator's introduction notes that the play premiered in Rome in 1921.<br />In \\"Six Characters,\\" a dysfunctional family confronts a theater director and his whole company. They challenge the director to turn their story into a play--a \\"painful drama.\\"<br />This richly ironic play deals with many issues: the relationship between life and literature; the limitation of words as tools of communication; sexual transgression; authority and art; secrecy and shame; the fractured, shifting nature of personal identity; the relationship between an author and the characters he/she creates; and more.<br />This is truly a play of ideas; it's a constantly shifting intellectual house of mirrors. But Pirandello never loses sight of the emotional issues of human shame, pain, and interpersonal alienation. The play is full of great lines; my favorite is spoken by the director: \\"There's no author here at all.\\"<br />It's amazing to think that (at the time of this review) this play is more than 80 years old. When I look at the contours of popular culture in the decades since this play premiered in Rome, it seems that Pirandello was as much a cultural prophet as he was a literary genius. \\"Six Characters\\" seems to prefigure such phenomena as reality TV shows (like \\"An American Family\\" or MTV's \\"The Real World\\") and films which explore the shadowy line between fiction and reality (like \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" or \\"Scream 3\\"). After all these decades, \\"Six Characters\\" remains a fresh, compelling, and relevant theatrical masterpiece.	2002-09-20

This book also contains a short preface, entitled \\"Manfridi and the Theatre of Excess,\\" by Peter Hall.<br />\\"Cuckoos\\" is an absolutely outrageous comedy. It opens with two of the characters (a man and a woman) naked, and painfully locked together in an act of sodomy. When the young man's gynecologist father arrives to try to help separate the two, the play becomes even more outrageous. As the characters explore both their present predicament and their past lives, the audience hears a story of sexual shame, secrets, revelations, and anger.<br />The play is full of sexually explicit language. There are some slapstick sight gags. The dialogue crackles with naughty wordplay and insults. While \\"Cuckoos\\" may be offensive to many, I found it to be a marvelous and memorable reading experience.	2002-09-20

The book is translated from the French by the author.<br />&quot;Endgame&quot; is a strange, surreal play about the relationship between a chair-bound man and his caretaker. It has both humorous and sad aspects as these characters deal with their past history. Pain and physical decay are significant themes in this play. Storytelling is an important motif here: Beckett seems to be asking if stories liberate or enslave us.<br />&quot;Act Without Words&quot; is a one-person mime in which a performer interacts with various moving props onstage. Overall, these two pieces did not make that great an impact on me; I was really expecting more. I recommend the book if you're interested in theatrical surrealism.	2002-09-20

The book combines a straightforward text with a wealth of photographs (both color photos and historic black-and-white photos). There is also a map of the memorial.<br />The book contains a brief biography of FDR and tells the historical story of the memorial from the early planning stage to its dedication in 1997. Philips discusses the contributions of architect Lawrence Halprin and the other creative people who helped give life to the memorial. There are many images of the statues and inscriptions at the memorial. I especially liked the statue of FDR's Scottish terrier, Fala, and the inscription of his Four Freedoms. Phillips also discusses the controversy over whether or not to depict FDR's disability in the memorial.<br />This book is very educational, and also inspiring. I've never seen the FDR memorial, and this book makes me want to visit it. And that's probably the best compliment I can pay to a book of this nature.	2002-09-19

The book is a basic introduction to Canada. Topics covered include the country's history, ethnic diversity, geography, educational system, sports, economy, government, and cultural scene. Some specific issues addressed include the Quebec separtist movement and the 1999 establishment of Nunavut as a self-governing Inuit territory.<br />The book includes a brief bibiliography, a list of Web sites, a glossary, and an index. The photographs capture some memorable images: the magnificent Chateau Frontenac in Quebec city, a Canadian Indian in colorful feathered attire, the wooded shores of Lake Superior, and more. Overall, an informative and visually striking introduction to this nation.	2002-09-19

There are many poems inspired by biblical characters. Some highlights are as follows:<br />\\"Sorrow Song\\": a global vision of human evil and suffering. \\"female\\": a poem that declares \\"there is an amazon in us.\\" \\"shapeshifter poems\\": a powerful sequence. \\"here be dragons\\": a poem that begins \\"So many languages have fallen / off the edge of the world / into the dragon's mouth.\\" I also loved the poems that celebrate (and sometimes mourn) the female body: \\"poem in praise of menstruation,\\" \\"poem to my uterus,\\" \\"to my last period,\\" etc.<br />When she's at her strongest, Clifton attains a truly prophetic quality. I recommend this book both to those who've read and loved her for years as well as to newcomers to this important poetic voice. If you like Clifton, I also recommend the writings of June Jordan and Audre Lorde.	2002-09-18

The plays in here include a one-character piece as well as two- and multi-character plays. The collection shows diversity in both form and content. There are 10 plays altogether.<br />My favorites from this collection are as follows: &quot;Mary MacGregor,&quot; by Keith Alan Benjamin, a 2-character piece about love and loss; &quot;How to Plant a Rose,&quot; by Elizabeth Diggs, a 1-person piece that combines family history and gardening; &quot;Donut Holes in Orbit,&quot; by Prince Golmolvilas, about a conflict between a Chinese-American woman and her immigrant mother; &quot;The Trio,&quot; by Shel Silverstein, an intriguing play about musicianship; &quot;The Hundred Penny Box,&quot; by Barbara Sundstrom, about conflict within a multigenerational African-American family (this play has an unforgettable character in 100-year old Aunt Dew); and &quot;Killing Hand,&quot; by David Zellnik, an unsettling play that deals with the aftermath of atrocities committed during the war in the former Yugoslavia.<br />This anthology shows just how potent the genre of the one-act play is. Thanks to the Ensemble Studio Theatre (that's the &quot;EST&quot; of the title) for promoting this genre.	2002-09-18

This book is essentially a novel in comic book form. It tells the story of Brian, a small town boy who moves to Astro City with dreams of joining the city's legion of costumed heroes. He ultimately joins up with the Confessor, a dark, brooding superhero, and together they face a chilling mystery that impacts all the city's heroes.<br />Many characters from other volumes in the Astro City series are woven into &quot;Confession&quot;: Crackerjack, the Hanged Man, Winged Victory, Samaritan, and many more. Also woven into the superhero story are a number of &quot;real world&quot; issues: crime, spirituality, governmental intrusiveness, and more. Along the way are some innovative concepts and characters; I was especially intrigued by the Crossbreed, a group of evangelical Christian superheroes introduced early in the story.<br />&quot;Confession&quot; is at once a coming-of-age tale, an intimate character study, and a vast epic tale that spans many decades and the entire planet. The story is also a skillful blend of concepts from the horror and science fiction genres. Like many of the great graphic novels of our time (&quot;Watchmen,&quot; &quot;Marvels,&quot; etc.) &quot;Confession&quot; deconstructs the very superhero genre to which it belongs. The characters are compelling, the dialogue is gripping, and the visual artwork is awesome: many scenes look like something from a big-budget science fiction film. In my opinion, &quot;Confession&quot; is a profoundly moving masterpiece.	2002-09-16

Charlie is challenged by his hosts to learn all about their culture; through his eyes, the reader also discovers the brave new world (to borrow a phrase) of the Ledom.<br />Sturgeon covers Ledom technology, religion, history, anatomy, and education. He includes an ironic parallel narrative about an ordinary 20th century human family; this second narrative frequently comments on our own culture's obsession with gender.<br />\\"Venus\\" is a compelling story of love, loss, and knowledge. It is part of an intriguing science fiction tradition of deconstructing societal ideas on sexuality and gender; for companion texts in this vein, try Ursula K. LeGuin's \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" and Carolyn Ives Gilman's \\"Halfway Human.\\"	2002-09-16

The book tells the story of young Laura, a pioneer girl who lives with her Pa, Ma, sister Mary, baby sister Carrie, bulldog Jack, and Black Susan the cat.<br />This book is a richly detailed portrait of pioneer life. There isn't much of a plot; the book is basically a record of the day-to-day lives of this hardy pioneer family. The book goes into fascinating detail about the family's activities: butchering a hog, smoking meat, churning butter, making bullets, fiddling, harvesting maple syrup, and more. Also fascinating are the characters' encounters with the various wild animals of the big woods--some dangerous, some cute.<br />The characters are memorable. Ma is the quintessential pioneer woman: hard-working and resourceful. I really got the sense that she's the glue that holds the family together. Pa is a particularly colorful and lovable character: a hunter, trapper, and farmer who is also a musician and a master storyteller. Indeed, the oral tradition of storytelling is an important motif in the book.<br />It's fascinating to escape to a world without DVDs, movie theaters, CDs, cable television, the Internet, or the other modern things we take for granted. This book takes us back to such a world, and reveals it to be a colorful and fascinating place.	2002-09-16

The simple, straightforward poems tell about life in Chinatown for a young boy whose family has emigrated from Hong Kong to the United States. The poems are accompanied by richly colored illustrations. A sample of the writing style: \\"If you have money in your pocket, / you're never hungry / in Chinatown.\\"<br />The illustrations capture many memorable images: a bunch of colorful kumquats, a cobbler at work, colorful dragon boats, and more. This book is a wonderful celebration of the people, food, and cultural events of Chinatown.	2002-09-14

The book is part of a set of three volumes; the other 2 contain plays for 2 actors and 3 actors. The introduction to this book briefly discusses the 10-minute play as a distinct theatrical form.<br />This collection of plays shows diversity in both tone and subject matter. Some plays are funny, some are creepy; topics covered include romance, marriage, violence, the impact of popular culture, war, communication, betrayal, revenge, and broken dreams.<br />This book is full of great pieces, but I'd like to mention a few that stood out for me. Richard Dresser's \\"The Road to Ruin\\": a Twilight Zone-ish tale about a couple whose car breaks down; Stephen Gregg's \\"A Private Moment,\\" a touching depiction of an episode in the lives of Chang and Eng, the original \\"Siamese Twins\\"; Kim Levin's \\"Just One Night,\\" which explores the issue of date rape; John Pielmeier's \\"Pillow Talk,\\" an outrageous, violent satiric comedy that takes place in a marriage counseling office; \\"The Processional,\\" by Robert D. Kemnitz and Jennifer McMaster, which depicts a very bizarre wedding rehearsal; Jane Martin's \\"Tattoo,\\" a funny and unsettling story of justice; and Sheri Wilner's \\"Labor Day,\\" which is dominated by a word game played by the characters.<br />The only disappointing thing about this anthology was the lack of any information about the authors of each play. But that complaint aside, this is an excellent anthology which I would recommend both for literature courses or just for some entertaining independent reading.	2002-09-14

The book contains pieces published between 1991 and 1998, as well as new material. It opens with a preface (done in comic strip format!) in which author Gregory appears as a comic strip character to directly address the reader; the cartoon Gregory is also confronted by Bitchy Butch herself!<br />BB is a really over-the-top character. She's a short-tempered, acid-tongued, middle-aged lesbian who directs her frequent angry tirades against many targets: men, straight women, bisexual women, &quot;femmey&quot; lesbians, drag queens, promiscuous gay men, the religious right, and more. But BB does occasionally show her softer side (usually with her two cats). Annoyed at the heterosexist, male-dominated world she's stuck in, she longs for the good old days of emergent 1970's lesbian culture.<br />In two outrageous stories, BB meets Bitchy Bitch, her heavily-lipsticked hetersexual counterpart; the venom flies when these strong-willed women cross paths! We also see her encounters with the religious right, and flashbacks to her formative high school and college days. Along the way are some surprises.<br />One of the book's best sections is its conclusion, &quot;Bitchy Butch Has the Last Word,&quot; in which the character directly addresses the reader (and takes time to criticize &quot;Ms. Gregory's biased viewpoint&quot;). BB tries to give the reader a little insight into why she is the world's angriest lesbian.<br />Bitchy Butch is a full-bodied, in-your-face character. Although BB is in one sense a parodic stereotype, Gregory ultimately makes her more than that. The black and white drawings perfectly complement the frequently outrageous dialogue. The art has a crude, sometimes explosive energy. Sometimes surreal, sometimes grotesque, Gregory's visual style is full of satiric bite. I recommend &quot;Bitchy Butch&quot; to fans of lesbian literature, women's studies, graphic novels, and cutting-edge political humor.ans of lesbian literature, women's studies, graphic novels, and cutting-edge political humor.	2002-09-14

The book combines friendly, colorful illustrations with an easy-to-read text. Sample text: \\"I used to be the baby, but now I am big. I have a baby brother, and I help Mommy take care of him.\\"<br />The text and illustrations show the narrator doing many activities with his baby brother: playing with him, singing to him during a car ride, reading to him from a baby board book, etc. This is a sweet, charming book that shows a positive picture of an older brother interacting with a baby sibling. I really liked the cartoony pictures.	2002-09-12

But \\"The Guys,\\" by Anne Nelson, is definitely one that stands out from the pack. This is a two character play. The preface states that it \\"is based on a true experience.\\"<br />\\"The Guys\\" tells the story of Nick, a New York City fire captain who has lost many men in the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. He comes to see Joan, a writer, so that she can help him write eulogies for his fallen men. As the two characters talk about the dead firefighters, Nick opens up and they create testimonies to these men.<br />This is a very moving work of drama. Although rooted in the events of 9/11, the play touches on issues that transcend that specific historical moment; it's about the place of a writer in society and about the potential power of words as healing tools. It's also about how extraordinary events impact ordinary people.<br />A director's note states that the play was commissioned in response to the 9/11 events, and opened in December 2001. Recommended as a companion text: \\"The Laramie Project,\\" co-authored by Moises Kaufman; this is another fact-based play about how people respond to a violent tragedy.	2002-09-08

She and her brother Mauricio are attacked by a gang of racist white kids who paint the girls' face a ghostly shade of white. The story deals with the aftermath of this repulsive crime.<br />Shange has clearly approached this troubling material with admirable intentions, but I found the results unsatisfying. I felt that the ultimate message of racial reconciliation was not powerful enough to offset the nature of the crime. And a significant plot thread is left hanging. I fear that this book may be too upsetting for some kids; I recommend parental or teacher guidance.	2002-09-08

The book includes a glossary of the many Yiddish terms used in the stories.<br />Newman deals with a number of issues throughout the book: the AIDS crisis, President Reagan's controversial visit to Bitburg, the legacy of the Holocaust, religious chauvinism, \\"coming out\\" to parents, preservation of the Yiddish language, and more. Some of her issues seem a bit obvious and even forced, but overall she handles the material effectively.<br />I found the best story in the collection to be the title story; it's about the relationship between an elderly Jewish man and his writing teacher, a young Jewish lesbian. Also impressive is \\"The Gift,\\" which consists of snapshots of a woman's life from age 5 to adulthood. \\"Something Shiny\\" tells the story of a woman's participation in a lesbian & gay march on Washington. Although much of the book has a dated feel, overall the collection is very moving, and Newman effectively uses touches of humor to offset the seriousness of much of her subject matter.

In this installment, New York City schoolboy Zack and his dad encounter an extraterrestrial visitor while walking in Central Park. Zack and dad have a series of comic misadventures as they attempt to help the friendly ET. The book spoofs the popular paranormal TV drama \\"The X-Files\\" in the form of two characters who are parodies of characters from that series.<br />This is one of my favorite in the excellent \\"Zack\\" series.

The author has a vivid literary voice. Her poems are often nightmarish, sensual, and/or surreal; the book is full of bizarre, unsettling imagery. Her preoccupation with death is reminiscent of the work of Poe.<br />Here are some samples of her vision. \\"The moon tonight is red as something / too sweet and full of female screams to eat\\" (from \\"Andy's Lanes & Lounge\\"). \\"How skinny the Cornish hen /  appears in the oven. / A plucked, baked, feminine / fist\\" (from \\"Woman in a Girdle\\"). In another poem she describes the moon as \\"a blind blue infant face\\" (\\"My Heart\\"). Also remarkable is the title poem, which recalls a paranormal encounter with a fantastic bird. Although I didn't always find the poems totally coherent, Kasischke's voice is consistently compelling, and this book is definitely worth reading.	2002-09-07

A central character in the tale is the Rat, who hatches a cunning plot.<br />The illustrations really make this book special. The pictures appear to be photographs of intricate, beautifully colored paper sculptures. There are some really memorable scenes: the cat and rat lounging together; the majestic Heavenly God consulting with the Earth God; the arrival of the majestic, multicolored dragon; and more. Some scenes are rendered very cleverly; I especially loved an aerial view of the animals running through the trees. Overall, a great book for children (and adults!) who have an interest in myth and folklore, or who just love innovative artwork.	2002-09-06

Brenda Stevenson edited the journals for the Schomburg Library of Nineteenth Century Black Women Writers. The introduction gives the basic facts about the author. She was born in 1837 into a wealthy, free African-American family in Philadelphia. She had a distinguished career as a writer, teacher, and activist before she died in Washington, DC in 1914. The journals span the years 1854-92.<br />Grimke's writings offer a fascinating window into the 19th century U.S. Her own life and interests are vividly portrayed. It is particularly interesting how great a role the anti-slavery movement played in her life; this cause strikes me as one of her truly great passions. She also discusses at length the authors who had an impact on her: Nathaniel Hawthorne (&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; is praised as a &quot;thrilling story&quot;), Harriet Beecher Stowe, John Milton, John Greenleaf Whittier (&quot;the 'Great Poet of Humanity'&quot;), Charles Dickens, Homer (she prefers Cowper's translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot; to Pope's), and more. She even recalls seeing Ralph Waldo Emerson lecture in person.<br />Later entries tell of her own work as a teacher. There are some interesting little episodes, such as an account of getting her daguerrotype taken. And she also writes frankly of her experience of racism.<br />This volume includes a chronology of the author's life, a list of people who played a part in her life, and over 80 pages of endnotes. Charlotte's voice is wonderfully likeable: full of life and intelligence. In these journals she emerges as an inquisitive spirit with a hunger for knowledge and a passion for justice. I recommend this book to those interested in 19th century American history, women's studies, and/or African-American studies, or to those who simply love great books as much as Charlotte did.	2002-09-05
1419033:US	51987970	RUYRWRENOIRAP	0451627911	846499334	The Mentor Book of Major American Poets (Mentor Series)	Books	4	14	14	N	N	Good, but shows its age	\\"The Mentor Book of Major American Poets,\\" edited by Oscar Williams and Edwin Honig, brings together generous selections from the work of 20 writers: Edward Taylor, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Edwin Arlington Robinson, Stephen Crane, Robert Frost, Vachel Lindsay, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, John Crowe Ransom, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Archibald MacLeish, E.E. Cummings, Hart Crane, and W.H. Auden. These authors span the 17th to 20th centuries (the youngest was born in 1907). Many styles, forms, and themes are contained within this rich anthology.<br />That having been said, I must note that the book has a copyright date of 1962, and it really shows its age. It's hard to imagine someone compiling an anthology of major american poets (to 1962) today and making the omissions that Williams and Honig did: Anne Bradstreet, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Carl Sandburg, Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, and many others.<br />Despite its deficiencies, this is a wonderful collection that contains a wealth of memorable pieces. A few of my favorites: Taylor's rapturous \\"Stupendous Love!\\"; Emerson's \\"The Snowstorm,\\" which celebrates the \\"frolic architecture of the snow\\"; Poe's masterwork \\"The Raven\\"; Whitman's ecstatic, all-embracing \\"Song of Myself\\"; a marvelous selection of Dickinson's quirky genius; Robinson's tragic \\"Richard Cory\\"; S. Crane's haunting short poems; Lindsay's lush, musical (and very politically incorrect!) \\"The Congo\\"; Cummings' amazing sonnet beginning \\"when serpents bargain for the right to squirm\\"; and much more.<br />I recommend this book for anyone interested in American poetry, but caution that, because of its dated nature, it needs to be supplemented.	2002-09-05

According to an introductory note, the play was given a workshop production at the Seattle Repertory Theatre in 1984 and opened at New York's American Place Theatre in 1987. The play takes place in New York City, and spans the years 1908-1917.<br />The play is about Marion, a young woman who, while still a teenager, marries a man more than old enough to be her father. Her new husband, Juster, has a son Marion's age. Additional issues complicate the lives of this family unit. Fornes follows this family's emotional journey over the course of time.<br />&quot;Abingdon&quot; deals with such issues as fantasy, temptation, guilt, and loss. There are some really painful scenes. The play has many touches with potential symbolic meaning. Overall, a solid piece of drama. Also recommended: Fornes' &quot;Fefu and Her Friends.&quot;	2002-09-04

The Signet Classic edition contains a preface by Studs Terkel and a very informative introduction by Fred L. Gardaphe. Terkel notes that the book was first published in 1939, and compares it to John Steinbeck's \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\"<br />\\"Christ\\" tells the story of an urban, working-class Italian-American family in the early part of the 20th century. Much of the book is focused on Paul, a young man who finds work as a bricklayer.<br />di Donato writes with a vivid style; he attains a muscular poetry of blood and concrete as he describes the workers' \\"symphony of struggle.\\" He brings to life both the specifics of Italian-American life as well as the larger multicultural world in which Paul's family lives. The book deals with Italian-American folk beliefs, tenement living, bilingualism, and a young man's sexual awakening. di Donato also writes on the theme of the common person's struggle against uncaring officialdom. He also explores the question of faith in the face of suffering.<br />There are many vivid scenes and characters in this novel. One account of an Italian-American feast is particularly memorable. There are also some really graphic, horrifying descriptions of workplace death and injury. I believe that this powerful novel belongs on the shelf with all those great books that sympathetically look at the oppressed and the overworked in the United States. And for another author who has written eloquently on the Italian-American experience, I recommend the fiction of John Fante.	2002-09-01
1422861:US	51987970	RWOPKQFO6PL1L	1880238373	174237681	the terrible stories (American Poets Continuum)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Thoughtful poems that deal with loss and loneliness	\\"The Terrible Stories,\\" by Lucille Clifton, is a collection of poems that are written in a clear, straightforward style. The themes that strike me as most present in the collection are loss, loneliness, and the burdens of history. The poems within the book are grouped into a number of sequences.<br />There is a sequence of poems about an encounter with a fox; for me this sequence brings to mind larger issues of human-animal relations. I found the most powerful sequence to be about breast cancer. In the first poem in that sequence, Clifton evokes \\"audre\\" (i.e. Audre Lorde, another poet who has written eloquently on breast cancer). Also very moving is \\"lumpectomy eve,\\" which captures the tenderness of \\"one breast / comforting the other.\\"<br />Some poems explore the connection between African-Americans and Africa (these specific poems are \\"hag riding,\\" \\"shadows,\\" and \\"memphis\\"). Some poems are more overtly political or sociological. \\"the son of medgar,\\" for example, deals with the trial of the assassin of Medgar Evers. \\"lorena\\" is a surprisingly gentle poem which evokes the story of a real-life woman who sexually mutilated her husband.<br />The final sequence in the book, \\"From the Book of David,\\" draws from the biblical narratives of King David. These poems explore the violence of David's life, and seem to be asking how we can reconcile David the warrior with David the poet.<br />Clifton writes with a quiet power in this collection. I recommend this book to all those interested in poetry, African-American studies, and/or women's studies.	2002-09-01
1423774:US	51987970	R2CYHKI1O6MUMN	048628235X	73864955	Short Stories (Dover Thrift Editions)	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Seven potent shots of Wharton's genius	The Dover Thrift Edition of \\"Short Stories\\" by Edith Wharton is a great collection of some of this writer's work. There are two common themes that run through this collection of 7 stories: (1) the writer and his/her place in society, and (2) women living through the complications of their emotional and/or sexual lives in the context of larger societal pressures. These thematic threads give the collection as a whole a pleasing coherence. The stories included are as follows:<br />\\"Expiation\\": about a woman novelist, this story looks at an intersection point in the worlds of literature and religion. \\"The Dilettante\\": about a troublesome romantic triangle. \\"The Muse's Tragedy\\": about the problematic emotional legacy of a respected poet. \\"The Pelican\\": follows the career of a female lecturer. \\"Souls Belated\\": about the relationship between a male novelist and a divorced woman. \\"Xingu\\": a comic tale about a snobby ladies' club that is hosting a woman novelist. \\"The Other Two\\": the story of a man's relationships with the two ex-husbands of his twice-divorced wife.<br />Wharton is an excellent writer, and her skills are really on full display in this collection. Peppered throughout the stories are a number of memorable (sometimes even Wildean) lines. Example: \\"It is always a bad sign when loud people come to a quiet place\\" (from \\"Souls\\"). An ideal choice for literature or women's studies courses (as well as for private reading). Recommended as companion texts: the novel \\"Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing,\\" by May Sarton, and the Dover Thrift Edition of \\"Short Stories\\" by Theodore Dreiser; both of these fine books share themes in common with this Wharton collection.	2002-08-31

It is richly illustrated with many photographs (both color and black-and-white). It includes maps, an index, a glossary, and other supplements. There is a chart of \\"fast facts\\" (ex. population, highest elevation, mining products, etc.) and a historic timeline.<br />Topics covered include history, geography, plant and animal life, ethnic groups, the school system, government structure, theater traditions, and more. My only complaint is that the book should have included more on Japan's remarkable language and complex writing system. But that aside, it's a solid reference work.	2002-08-31

Geared towards younger readers, the book is richly illustrated with many full-color photographs. Foley includes an overview of Puerto Rico and its people. Other topics covered include patron saints' festivals, the Calle San Sebastian festival, Three Kings Day, the Puerto Rican Day parade in New York City, salsa music, traditional dance, musical instruments, and more.<br />The book includes a map, glossary, and index. Also included are a recipe for besitos de coco (a kind of sweet) and instructions on making a vejigante mask (a traditional festival mask). The visual appeal of this book is outstanding, and the information in it is, on the whole, well presented.	2002-08-29

The book is edited by Jerome M. Vereb. This book is full of visual appeal. The photographs, which show John Paul interacting with children of various ages, are crisp and full of life. The Pope is effectively depicted as a caring and joyful man.<br />The book is beautifully designed. The Pope's word's are arranged as poetry on the pages; this nicely complements the photos. The text is drawn from the Pope's global ministry.<br />The content of the words themselves is often rather bland and vague. Controversial topics are generally avoided. Sometimes the messages are a bit mixed. In one excerpt, for example, the Pope seems to be taking a multifaith tone, praising children for offering each other \\"a hand / with no regard for color, / social condition, or religion.\\" Elsewhere he seems more theologically exclusive. For example, he claims that \\"a generous 'yes' to Christian faith / is the purest sense of the fullness of life\\"--a statement which I'm sure those of other faiths would dispute!<br />Still, many of the statements are relevant and inspirational to young people of any faith or culture. He tells young people, \\"The future belongs to you; / for you are the leaders of tomorrow\\" and challenges them to be \\"men and women of high principles / and hopes.\\" But the book as a whole is, in my judgment, mainly relevant for Catholic children and adults.	2002-08-29

It is divided into short, easy-to-read sections and is illustrated throughout with many colorful photos. Also included is a map.<br />The book covers a number of topics: population, crops, the state seal, state motto, state bird, etc. Included is a short list of places to visit (such as the USS Arizona memorial) and other supplements. The one thing that's missing, and which I think should have been included, is a list of famous people from Hawaii. But overall, a concise and interesting book.	2002-08-29

This entry in the series tells the epic story of Jewish life in North America. The book is richly illustrated with photographs (both color and black-and-white). The text is further supplemented with maps, sidebar articles, a glossary, and an index. Significant vocabulary words are boldfaced in the text: \\"immigrant,\\" \\"culture,\\" \\"czar,\\" etc.<br />Horton notes that Spanish Jews came to North America in 1654. Topics covered in the book include the flight from 19th century pogroms in Russia, the immigration station at Ellis Island, urban tenements, sweatshops, the 1911 Triangle factory fire, the Yiddish theater in America, Klezmer music, and more. There is a brief sections on the achievements of some famous North American Jews. Overall, a solid entry in this informative series.	2002-08-28

The book also includes a short essay, &quot;The Science-Fiction Year,&quot; by Charles N. Brown. This essay looks back at the year 1977 in film and literature.<br />One of the best pieces in the collection is John Varley's &quot;Lollipop and the Tar Baby,&quot; the story of a clone, traveling on a ship in deep space, who encounters a most amazing entity: a sentient black hole. This is a suspenseful tale that presents a compelling vision of humanity's future. Also impressive is Raccoona Sheldon's &quot;The Screwfly Solution,&quot; a chilling sci-fi/horror tale about an epidemic of murders of women by men. (Note: &quot;Raccoona Sheldon&quot; is a pseudonym of the author better known as James Tiptree Jr.). I also liked Vonda McIntyre's &quot;Aztecs,&quot; about physiologically altered starship pilots who are evolving into their own unique subculture.<br />The other stories in the book are Spider and Jeanne Robinson's &quot;Stardance,&quot; Michael Bishop's &quot;The House of Compassionate Sharers,&quot; Lee Killough's &quot;Tropic of Eden,&quot; Bruce McAllister's &quot;Victor,&quot; Lisa Tuttle's &quot;The Family Monkey,&quot; and Fritz Leiber's &quot;A Rite of Spring&quot; (this last story contains a particularly memorable depiction of a number-and-word game played by two characters). The collection as a whole is uneven, but the best of the stories make it worthwhile.	2002-08-28

The main text is supplemented with maps, sidebar articles, a glossary, and an index. Vocabulary words are boldfaced in the text: \\"immigration,\\" \\"pictographs,\\" \\"scholar,\\" etc.<br />Kite begins with an overview of Chinese history and culture. The text covers many topics: the great wave of 19th century immigration, Chinese work on North American railroads, the impact of anti-Chinese sentiment, the historic immigration station at Angel Island, the growth of urban Chinatowns, and more. There is a brief section on the contributions of famous North Americans of Chinese heritage. Overall, an informative and visually compelling book.	2002-08-28

The book is illustrated by Jack E. Davis. In this story, young Zack buys a dinosaur egg at a flea market. Things get out of hand when the egg hatches, and Zack finds himself caring for a voracious baby reptile.<br />This isn't, in my opinion, one of the best of the series, but it's still fun. The story also teaches valuable lessons about responsibility and compassion for animals.	2002-08-28

In this installment, our hero Zack is vacationing in Florida with his dad, and discovers that he (Zack, that is) has the ability to communicate telepathically with dolphins. Before the story is over, he must solve a mystery involving the marine mammals.<br />This book strikes just the right balance of paranormal fantasy, silly humor, and mystery.

The bulk of the book consists of encyclopedic entries on individual authors (generally 4 or 5 authors are covered on each 2-page spread). There is also a supplemental section of entries on major works of American literature. In addition, the book contains a short dictionary of groups, movements, and periodicals: there are entries on the Algonquin Round Table, the Black Mountain poets, Imagism, etc.<br />The book is illustrated throughout with photos of selected authors. The back cover boasts that the book contains more than 900 short biographies. These short bio capsules contain the authors' dates and places of birth (and death, if applicable), titles of major works, and other relevant data.<br />This is a solid and informative book. Yes, there are some regretable omissions: where, for example, are William Apess, Rita Mae Brown, Victor Hernandez Cruz, John Fante, and Hisaye Yamamoto? But what IS here is great. Whoever made the selections was sensitive in putting in a nicely multicultural mix of authors. There are particularly strong representations of Jewish and African-American authors. Also impressive is the presence of many science fiction writers; gay male and lesbian writers are also well represented. This may not be the definitive reference work on American writers, but it's useful and consistently interesting.	2002-08-28

Quite possibly so. \\"Watchmen\\" is a self-contained story that follows two generations of costumed superheroes over several decades of their history (the story spans from the 1930s to the 1980s). Moore's characters are truly unforgettable: the violent Comedian, the Batman-like Nite Owl, the disturbed Rorschach, the dazzling Ozymandias (known as \\"the world's smartest man\\"), the sexy female crimefighter known as the Silk Spectre, the godlike Dr. Manhattan, and more. Much of these characters' lives are lived in the shadow of the Cold War and possible nuclear armageddon (a particularly resonant theme for those of us who remember that era).<br />Moore's complex story moves back and forth in time, and shifts in perspective among the main characters. As he skillfully deconstructs the concept of the costumed superhero, Moore deals with a host of potentially explosive issues: sexual violence, politics, mental illness, etc. This is very much an adult story.<br />One of the book's most intelligent devices is the alternation of the comic book format with excerpts of the story told in other media: a newspaper clipping, personal correspondence, a psychiatric report, chapters from one character's autobiography, etc. This gives the book as a whole a richer texture and a powerful satiric thrust. Along the way Moore also riffs on classic superhero story elements: the origin story, the superhero teamup story, etc.<br />The visuals in \\"Watchmen\\" are amazing: some scenes are graphically violent and horrific; some magical and hauntingly beautiful. This world is populated with rich, fully developed characters who have complex emotional and moral lives. To sum up, \\"Watchmen\\" is a truly epic story that is told with consummate skill and power. It's a book that should, I believe, be read by both comic book fans and by those who don't normally read that medium.	2002-08-27

Robinson doesn't shy away from controversial subjects; for example, she discusses the impact of the anti-fur movement on the Cree, for whom hunting and trapping have been important economic activities.	2002-08-26

The cover art is often titillating, often outrageous; there are occasional hints of violence and some really poignant images. A fascinating historical collection of images of lesbianism in popular culture.	2002-08-25

Dillard's sources include &quot;The American Boys Handy Book&quot; (1892), an 1853 maritime conference report, a 1926 junior high school English text, van Gogh's letters, and more.<br />Dillard admits that half of the poems in this book &quot;are just jokes.&quot; Some of them are quite clever and thought-provoking; in some of them she really seems to change the original author's intent. Dillard thus, in a broader sense, makes us question the very nature of the written text and the nature of its relationship to potential readers.<br />There are some really interesting passages in this book. She mines a stunning section on pain from a prehospital emergency care book. I found the funniest piece to be a &quot;Index of First Lines,&quot; from two poetry anthologies. Overall, an intriguing book.	2002-08-25

Thus, each entry is stripped down to its bare essentials: the word, what part of speech it is, a very brief definition, and some inflected forms. If you're looking for extensive descriptions of word origins, look elsewhere.<br />The introduction notes that the dictionary includes \\"obsolete, archaic, slang, [and] nonstandard words.\\" This includes a lot of words that would be considered obscene. There are plenty of ethnic slurs, as well as colorful words for private body parts and intimate biological functions--the \\"f-word\\" and its various derivations, for example, are included. So if you're sensitive about such matters, be warned!<br />Words greater than 8 letters long are not included (unless they are inflected forms of a main entry). Thus, for actual Scrabble play this book should be supplemented by a more general dictionary. Proper names, hyphenated words, and other words not acceptable in Scrabble are not included.<br />All that being said, this is an enormously entertaining dictionary. Words from \\"aa\\" (\\"rough cindery lava\\") to \\"zyzzyva\\" (\\"a tropical weevil\\") are included. Acceptable variant spellings of some words are also included; for example, we find out that \\"koumis,\\" \\"koumys,\\" \\"koumyss,\\" \\"kumiss,\\" and \\"kumys\\" are all acceptable spellings of \\"koumiss\\" (\\"a beverage made from camel's milk\\").<br />Other fun words included in this dictionary: \\"ajowan\\" (\\"the fruit of an Egyptian plant\\"), \\"britska\\" (\\"an open carriage\\"), \\"eeliest\\" (\\"superlative of eely\\"), \\"firepink\\" (\\"a flowering plant\\"), \\"maumetry\\" (\\"idolatry\\"), \\"peetweet\\" (\\"a wading bird\\"), \\"quokka\\" (\\"a short-tailed wallaby\\"), and \\"schmelze\\" (\\"a type of decorative glass\\").

The book tells about the relationship between Lai Goon and her granchildren, Allyson and Daniel. An immigrant from China, Lai Goon speaks Chinese and tells the grandkids about her life in China. She teaches them traditional Chinese calligraphy and other parts of their shared cultural heritage.<br />This is an interesting book that is full of many photos, many of them in full color. My favorite photo shows Grandma doing tai chi in a bright yellow sweatsuit. The photos of her with her grandhildren are warm and enjoyable to see. The book ends with a suggested exercise on doing research into one's own family history. Overall, a good book for young readers of any ethnic group.	2002-08-23

O'Reilly's book \\"The No Spin Zone: Confrontations with the Powerful and Famous in America\\" seems to be an attempt to translate his TV style into book form. I think it's only partially successful.<br />The book is broken up into several chapters, each one devoted to a specific topic (offensive music lyrics, Jesse Jackson's finances, etc.). Each chapter contains transcripts of confrontational interviews conducted by O'Reilly, together with his commentary. O'Reilly admits that these interviews are edited. The setup of the book seems unfair; O'Reilly ALWAYS gets the last word! He thus comes off as a bullying control [person], rather than as a proponent of real debate. And that's unfortunate, because in my viewing of O'Reilly on TV I've always felt that in general he is a fair man. Of course, maybe the chapters' structure would have been more effective if O'Reilly's closing commentaries didn't descend into heavy-handed preachiness, as they tend to do.<br />Despite the annoying structure, the book does contain a lot of interesting and relevant material. One chapter contains a fascinating account of events from O'Reilly's pre-\\"Factor\\" journalism career. Many of the dialogues are also intriguing. Don't miss, for example, his exchange with George W. Bush on the death penalty. The book contains some surprises; for example, I got the sense that O'Reilly had real respect for activist Al Sharpton despite the men's differences.<br />Of course, there is also some silly material, such as his fantasy about being murdered by Hilary Clinton's Secret Service guards. And O'Reilly's introduction, in which he sets himself up as the champion of the common man, sounds a bit over-the-top and even egotistical.<br />Another thing I didn't like about the book was the fact that O'Reilly often makes claims without providing sufficient documentation to back it up. \\"The No Spin Zone\\" is a quick and interesting read, but it strikes me as a book primarily suited for hard-core O'Reilly fans.e fact that O'Reilly often makes claims without providing sufficient documentation to back it up. \\"The No Spin Zone\\" is a quick and interesting read, but it strikes me as a book primarily suited for hard-core O'Reilly fans.	2002-08-23

It opens with an oak tree reviving and putting out buds in springtime. Morrison follows the majestic tree through all the seasons of the year, and depicts the diverse community of animals that live in and around it: the mourning cloak butterfly, red-tailed hawk, downy woodpecker, gray squirrel, honeybees, skunks, tree crickets, gray tree frog, and more.<br />This elegant but earthy book is packed full of nature facts. The beautiful illustrations are rich in detail. It seems to me that Morrison has a deep reverence for nature; such a reverence is communicated to me through this wonderful book. If you've never had the urge to hug a tree before, you just might want to do so after reading &quot;Oak Tree.&quot;	2002-08-22

The book's easy-to-read text makes it appropriate for younger readers. The book includes a map of Puerto Rico, a short list of places to visit (such as Old San Juan), a list of vocabulary words, a short bibliography for further reading, and an index.<br />The book is illustrated throughout with some excellent full-color photographs. Topics addressed include natural resources, the commonwealth motto (&quot;Joannes Est Nomen Ejus,&quot; which means &quot;John Is His Name&quot;), the capital and capitol building, the flag, etc. One of the more interesting sections is about the cocqui, the tree frog which is considered the island's unofficial animal.<br />What the book lacks, and which would have enhanced it, is a list of famous Puerto Ricans. In fact, not a single human being is pictured in the entire book! But despite this omission, this is an interesting and informative reference work.	2002-08-21

Wells were the two great pioneers of modern science fiction. But \\"The Science Fiction of Edgar Allan Poe,\\" edited and with an introduction by Harold Beaver, well demonstrates that Poe was the pioneer who preceded those two giants of the genre. In fact, in his introduction Beaver notes that \\"Jules Verne himself acknowledged his debt to Poe.\\" This book brings together a good selection of Poe's writings, with extensive endnotes.<br />The book as a whole is a mixed bag. Some of the pieces strike me as experiments which don't quite hold up. But the best of these pieces superbly showcase Poe's wit, descriptive skill, and active imagination. My favorite pieces are as follows:<br />\\"The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall\\": the story of a fantastic balloon journey; filled with clever details. \\"A Descent into the Maelstrom\\": an adventure story about an encounter with a horrific whirlpool. \\"Some Words with a Mummy\\": a humorous satire about an Egyptian mummy revived scientifically. And \\"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\\": a creepy tale about death and \\"Mesmerism\\" (i.e. hypnosis); this story has the most in common with Poe's famous canon of horror tales.<br />Other selections in the book include \\"The Conversation of Eiros and Charmion,\\" \\"A Tale of the Ragged Mountains,\\" \\"The Balloon-Hoax,\\" \\"The System of Dr Tarr and Prof. Fether,\\" and some others. The longest piece in the book (at about 100 pages) is \\"Eureka: An Essay on the Material and Spiritual Universe.\\" It's rather tedious and dated; in it Poe discusses such topics as the formation of the solar system, the age of the stars, and the nature of the human soul.<br />The best pieces in this book are truly remarkable. If you want to trace the genealogy of science fiction, don't miss this collection.	2002-08-21

Its 24 pages contain an easy-to-read text and many excellent full-color photographs; it is a suitable book for younger readers.<br />The book includes a map of the state, representations of the state seal and flag, a short list of places worth visiting (such as Harpers Ferry National Historical Park), a list of vocabulary words, a short bibliography for further reading, and an index. Subjects addressed include population, natural resources, the state motto (&quot;Montani Semper Liberi,&quot; Latin for &quot;Mountaineers are always free&quot;), the capitol building, the state bird, etc. There are some particularly nice wildlife photos.<br />The one thing this book lacks is a list of famous West Virginians. There are no photos of any of them. In fact, except for the characters on the state flag and seal, not a single human being is pictured in the entire book! This lack of the human element detracts from an otherwise fine book (and, by the way, I have noticed this lack in the other books in the series). Still, the book's other fine qualities make it worth recommending.	2002-08-21

She is annoyed at her folks for keeping the store open on July 4th: \\"No one wants Chinese food on the Fourth of July, I say.\\" But is she right or wrong? Read the book to find out!<br />The enjoyable story is perfectly complemented by Chodos-Irvine's colorful illustrations, which have an elegantly stylized quality to them. I especially liked the pictures of the family at work in the restaurant. \\"Apple Pie\\" is a wonderful story about entrepreneurship, and about how different cultural traditions contribute to the unique mix that is the United States.	2002-08-20

Gregory Christie. Together they tell the story of Truth, who was an important figure in the movement to abolish slavery in the United States. The text discusses her own life in slavery, how she gained her freedom, and her participation in the abolitionist movement. The book includes a chronology of her life.<br />The illustrations are colorful and striking, but Christie's human figures are bizarrely distorted, with out-of-proportion heads, limbs, and hands. Ultimately I found that this style distracted me from the important story being told. Still, this book is a worthwhile look at an important figure in American history.	2002-08-20

Brautigan's style is often surreal, often tender, with touches of witty humor. The poems are written in a clear, straightforward free verse. Here is an example of his style (from \\"The Chinese Checker Players\\"): \\"When I was six years old / I played Chinese checkers / with a woman / who was ninety-three years old.\\"<br />Recurrent themes in the book include love, sex, loss, and loneliness. Incorporated throughout are an intriguing mix of pop and \\"high\\" culture references: Jefferson Airplane, Ophelia, the New York Yankees, John Donne, etc. The book often has an earthy flavor; Brautigan writes about such topics as his own penis or the smell of a fart. Some particularly memorable poems include the following:<br />\\"All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace,\\" a science fiction vision of a \\"cybernetic meadow\\"; the open-ended \\"Karma Repair Kit: Items 1-4\\"; \\"Discovery,\\" a joyful poem about sexual intimacy; the surreal \\"The Pumpkin Tide\\"; the funny, haiku-like \\"November 3\\"; and \\"A Good-Talking Candle,\\" which invites the reader into an altered state of perception.<br />Although most of the poems are very short, there is one longer poem: the 9-part, 9-page \\"the Galilee Hitch-hiker,\\" which chronicles the surreal adventures of Baudelaire (among other experiences, he opens an unconventional hamburger stand in San Francisco). If you only know Brautigan from his weird and wonderful novels, I recommend you read this remarkable collection of poems.	2002-08-20

As the book progresses, Joel becomes more intimately involved with the people of his father's household and of the larger community; there is a stress on oral history as Joel learns their stories. Overall, plot struck me as secondary to character revelation.<br />The people of Joel's new world are colorful, often pathetic, and sometimes grotesque; at times it really feels like Capote is putting on a human freak show for the thrill-seeking reader. He leads us through a world of decaying old buildings and broken spirits. But Capote always respects the essential humanity of his troubled characters.<br />There is a pronounced theme of alternative sexuality and/or gender identity throughout the book. Capote establishes this theme early on in his description of the main character. Joel is described as not looking like a \\"'real' boy\\": \\"He was too pretty, too delicate and fair-skinned.\\" \\"Other Voices\\" thus has a lot to offer readers with an interest in gender issues as they have been explored in American literature. Capote also does an interesting job of portraying a mixed-race household where the African-American servants are as vividly drawn as the Caucasian family members.<br />Throughout the book there is some richly descriptive language, as well as intriguing representations of American vernacular English. Although at times \\"Other Voices\\" seems more an exercise in style than a fully satisfying narrative, it is for me quite a remarkable coming-of-age story.	2002-08-16

Sarton includes a preface in which she reflects on writing poems in the 79th and 80th years of her life. In the preface she also pays tribute to her cat Pierrot (who is also mentioned in some of the poems).<br />Sarton writes with a style that is as clear as a ringing bell, but gentle and often sensuous. The central recurring theme to the book (as indicated by the title) is growing old. But Sarton is not bitter; rather, she is observant and reflective. Other important themes in the book include violence and suffering, love and friendship, and the beauties of the natural world. Her attentive eye captures animals' footprints on newly fallen snow, the flight of a golden finch, the dance of fireflies, and other wonderful things.<br />Some outstanding poems: \\"December Moon,\\" which is rich in nature images; \\"After the Long Enduring,\\" about a friend's struggle with AIDS; \\"The Artist,\\" a delightful piece about an elephant with an artistic talent; \\"The Scream,\\" which captures an act of violence in the natural world; and \\"Getting Dressed,\\" about the effort of getting dressed when you're old.<br />In a back cover blurb for the book, Gwendolyn Brooks describes May Sarton as \\"a woman of magnificent radiance--a Truth-teller!!\\" I couldn't have said it better myself. For another great collection of poetry that has growing old as a key theme, try Allen Ginsberg's \\"Cosmopolitan Greetings.\\"	2002-08-14

The 7 plays in this volume were produced between 1920 and 1960, and explore many facets of the Jewish-American experience. Love and loss, war, anti-Semitism, class conflict, political debate, legal quandaries, economic struggle, family relationships, theological questions: it's all here in 636 pages of electrifying theatrical genius. The plays are as follows:<br />\\"Welcome Stranger,\\" by Aaron Hoffman: a comedy about a businessman's fight against anti-Semitism; features a particularly engaging hero. \\"Counsellor-at-Law,\\" by Elmer Rice: a fast-moving play that takes place in the New York law offices of its main character. \\"Awake and Sing!\\", by Clifford Odets: The story of a working-class family in New York City; full of colorful syntax and expressions. \\"Morning Star,\\" by Sylvia Regan: a very moving play that follows a New York City family over the course of two decades; historical events like the Triangle factory fire are skillfully woven into the story. \\"Home of the Brave,\\" by Arthur Laurents: the story of a Jewish-American soldier and his unit in combat in the Pacific theater during World War II; features some really harrowing scenes. \\"The Cold Wind and the Warm,\\" by S.N. Behrman: A story of love, loss, and friendship; biblical law plays a key plot point. And finally, \\"The Tenth Man,\\" by Paddy Chayefsky: A story of supernatural possession that takes place entirely in an orthodox synagogue on Long Island; a marvelous blend of dark comedy and creepy horror.<br />I've never seen any of these plays performed. But for the most part, the plays in this volume make excellent reading texts. \\"Awake & Singing\\" is one of those great anthologies that I would recommend for classroom use, for reading groups, and for the individual reader. Especially recommended if you're interested in 20th century American drama or the Jewish-American experience.ience.	2002-08-14

Simak's novel &quot;City&quot; sketches out the future history of the planet Earth: a future of genetically altered talking dogs, mutated humans, omnipresent robots, and other wonders. Simak uses a richly ironic structure to tell this vast saga. The novel is broken up into eight &quot;tales,&quot; each of which is prefaced by a short note. Each of these eight notes is actually part of Simak's fiction. The commentary on the first tale, for example, refers to humankind as a &quot;mythical race&quot; which may have never actually existed.<br />Within this bold but witty structure, Simak deals with such themes as philosophy, phobia, history, legend, violence, culture, and evolution. The book is filled with memorable moments; one of my favorites is a poignant encounter between a genetically advanced talking dog and a primitive wolf. Simak's portrait of the ultimate fate of humanity is comparable to the work of Arthur C. Clarke in &quot;Childhood's End.&quot; Throughout the book, Simak has a charming, enjoyable writing style. &quot;City&quot; is a book that, in my opinion, belongs in the canon of science fiction classics.	2002-08-14

When a two-person team comes to interview her, she reflects on her life, love affairs, and literary career.<br />\\"Mrs. Stevens\\" is a fascinating fictional portrait of a woman writer. It's fun to hear the characters discuss the novels and poetry books written by this invented character; the book has an almost Borgesian flavor in parts as this imaginary oeuvre is explored. In this book Sarton also explores sexual and romantic love in its various permutations: male-male, female-male, and female-female. Along the way the characters invoke a number of important female writers: Sappho, Jane Austen, Colette, etc.<br />Sarton deals with a number of compelling issues in this book: the tension between female creativity and procreativity; women's mental health; the fickle fortunes of the literary world; and the impact of a book's reception on its author. Sarton has a satiric touch in her look at the literary/publishing establishment, a gentle touch in her look at human relations. And throughout there are some nice touches, like details about Hilary's work in her garden. Overall, a solid achievement from an impressively prolific writer.	2002-08-13

Burroughs' \\"Exterminator!\\" describes the book as an \\"experimental novel.\\" Because of the book's fragmented, mosaic-like structure, I think you could also describe it as a collection of experimental prose fragments. It's a blend of science fiction, political satire, and linguistic theory, punctuated by violence and gay sex. Burroughs sometimes uses language that mirrors cinematic techniques.<br />If there's a plot in here, it eluded me. Along the way the reader will encounter a secret agent, a pest exterminator, Scientology, the queen of England, and John Genet. \\"Exterminator!\\" is often outrageous and absurd; it feels at times like Burroughs is just writing to amuse himself.	2002-08-13

Dick, is a science fiction novel that pushes the boundaries of the genre. It takes place in an alternate America where Germany and Japan won World War II. The Pacific States of America are ruled by Japan through a puppet white government; the Germans have engaged in genocide in Africa and are pursuing an aggressive space program. That's only the beginning of the \\"what if?\\" strangeness.<br />In \\"Man,\\" Dick uses a dual book-within-the-book theme. The plot and characters are continuously impacted by two texts: first, the ancient Chinese oracle known as the I Ching, and second, \\"The Grasshopper Lies Heavy,\\" a banned novel of yet another alternate America. The book thus becomes a mindbending literary house of mirrors.<br />This is a bizarre, intelligent, and compelling work of fiction. There may be just a little too much going on; in the end, I'm not sure if the book completely holds together.

A collection of short pieces, it is written by a death row inmate who was convicted of murdering a police officer, but who many supporters believe to be innocent. The book contains a foreword by Cornel West and an introduction by Julia Wright. Also included is a prison interview with the author.<br />From a literary standpoint, West really hypes up the author in his foreword; he compares Abu-Jamal to Herman Melville, Theodore Dreiser, Toni Morrison, Eugene O'Neill, and other great American authors. Wright contributes further to this theme, comparing \\"Death Blossoms\\" to works by Baudelaire and Oscar Wilde. So is Mumia all that? I don't know, but \\"Death Blossoms\\" is good stuff.<br />Although there is the expected sociopolitical critique, \\"Death Blossoms\\" is, at its core, the record of the author's spiritual journey. Abu-Jamal reflects on his mother's Baptist heritage and his father's Episcopalianism; he also details his explorations of other spiritual paths: Judaism, Catholicism, and the Black Muslim movement. His writings in these sections are powerful and evocative. Ultimately, he pays tribute to the guru known as John Africa and discusses at some length the path founded by this man.<br />Abu-Jamal also writes about prison life, the media, and United States history. Along the way he cites such diverse sources as Salman Rushdie, Ray Bradbury, the Qu'ran, Nietsche, and Ghanaian folklore.<br />Overall, this is a fascinating book. I did feel that some of the supplemental material by other authors reads too much like a hagiography of Mumia; it's like the publishers are trying to market him as some kind of modern saint. I also felt that this supplemental material was insensitive to the victim of the crime for which Abu-Jamal was convicted.<br />Is Abu-Jamal really guilty of murder, or is he an innocent man who was wrongly convicted under a fatally flawed system? I don't know. But I can say that \\"Death Blossoms\\" is a compelling piece of contemporary literature.em? I don't know.

It's a blend of Chinese-American family saga, heroic fantasy, ghost story, and first-person account of growing up Chinese-American. The book is divided into five sections: &quot;No Name Woman,&quot; &quot;White Tigers,&quot; &quot;Shaman,&quot; &quot;At the Western Palace,&quot; and &quot;A Song for a Barbarian Reed Pipe.&quot; Although each of these sections could stand as an independent unit, together they form a coherent and compelling whole.<br />&quot;Woman Warrior&quot; features a number of compelling characters. They include a female warrior (whose story might remind you of the film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;), a Chinese woman doctor, and a Chinese-American girl who is navigating her way between her two cultures. Along the way Kingston addresses many issues: multilingualism, dragon lore, cross dressing, magical transformation, ghost fighting strategy, Chinese polygamy, mental illness, family relationships, and women's roles in traditional Chinese culture.<br />Although at times a bit grim, &quot;Woman Warrior&quot; is also often quite lively and colorful. For some interesting companion texts that deal with comparable subject matter, try Eric Liu's essay collection &quot;The Accidental Asian&quot; and David Henry Hwang's play &quot;Golden Child.&quot; For a marvelous complementary text from a Japanese-American female perspective, try Yoshiko Uchida's &quot;Desert Exile.&quot;	2002-07-27

The collection as a whole is surreal, often bizarre, and often a lot of fun.<br />My favorites from this collection are as follows: &quot;The Balloon,&quot; in which a giant balloon is inflated over Manhattan (this story in particular raises questions about the nature and meaning of art); &quot;The Dolt,&quot; about a man &quot;preparing to take the National Writers' Examination&quot; (this one contains segments of a story-within-the-story); &quot;The Police Band,&quot; about the hoped for &quot;triumph of art over good sense&quot;; &quot;Game,&quot; a claustrophobic psychological study of two officers confined in what sounds like a missile launching site; and &quot;See the Moon?&quot;, a warped look at parenthood and academia (this story has quite a bit of alliteration and amusing wordplay). This collection as a whole reveals Barthelme to be an inventive practitioner of the short story form.	2002-07-26

It tells the story of Horton \\"Horty\\" Bluett, a young boy who lives unhappily with his abusive adoptive father. The boy's only \\"friend\\" is a jack-in-the-box with glittering, jeweled eyes. To escape the abuse, Horty runs away and joins a traveling freak show, where he is befriended by an extraordinary trio of midgets. Ultimately, Horty's odyssey leads him to seek the mystery behind a strange and marvelous life form that is unlike any other species on earth.<br />\\"Jewels\\" is a fascinating story. A key theme is the notion of being a \\"freak,\\" an outcast. Sturgeon effectively explores the emotional ramifications of this theme, and vividly depicts his outcasts' search for love and community. He makes good use of the carnival setting in his narrative. Although the story's villainous characters are a bit shallow, the other characters are complex and well-developed.<br />Other important themes in \\"Jewels\\" include education, masquerade (including gender-switching), transformation, and communication in its many forms. Sturgeon explores both individuals' desire to dominate and abuse others, as well as the capacity for love and tenderness. Sturgeon's prose style is well suited for the complex task of this book. Overall clear and economical, his prose is at times richly descriptive, at times quite poetic.<br />At one point Charles Fort, the tireless documenter of strange phenomena, is mentioned in the book, and that reference is quite resonant. In \\"The Dreaming Jewels,\\" Sturgeon embraces and celebrates those who are seen as weird or deviant, and discovers the humanity behind the freak show exteriors.	2002-07-26

The book has a copyright date of 1956, and was issued in a Pocket Books paperback edition in 1968, with a new preface by Wouk. In his preface, Wouk notes that the novel was actually written in 1949. The novel tells the story of a United States astronaut who travels to the moon and discovers a race of human-like beings living beneath the lunar surface.<br />Wouk uses a \\"text within a text within a text\\" format to structure his tale. The first \\"layer\\" of the story consists of \\"official\\" documents by a Navy official and a professor; this frame material assures the reader that the astronaut's narrative is a fiction written as a result of hallucination. The second layer of the text is the astronaut's salvaged first-person account of his encounter with the lunar nation of Lomokome. The third layer is the astronaut's alleged English translation of the Book of Ctuzelawis, the sacred text which dominates the lives of the moon people. The central topic of the Book of Ctuzelawis is the Law of Reasonable War.<br />I read \\"The 'Lomokome' Papers\\" as an intriguing satire of social attitudes towards war, death, and violence. Wouk's use of the sacred text motif is alo noteworthy; this aspect of the novel puts it in the company of such literary works as Gore Vidal's \\"Messiah\\" and Octavia Butler's \\"Parable of the Sower.\\" Wouk's vision strikes me as being as relevant today as it was when he first wrote the book. This is definitely a curious text which deserves continued attention.	2002-07-24

It could be seen as a milestone in both African-American literature and science fiction; it's also a novel with a lot for feminist readers and critics. But ultimately the power of this book allows it to transcend all labels.<br />\\"Kindred\\" tells the story of Dana, a 20th century African-American woman who is married to a white man. Throughout the book Dana is mysteriously thrust back and forth in time between her world and the world of her ancestors in the 19th century. She seems to be tied to one ancestor in particular: Rufus, the white son of a slaveowning family. Part of Dana's struggle is to deal with the utterly alien world of Rufus' slaveowning culture.<br />Butler brilliantly weaves many powerful themes into this gripping story: violence, sexual desire, race, literacy, language, law, and education. The story is peopled with well-developed characters who have complex, interconnected relationships. Butler vividly evokes how the slave system both physically brutalized blacks and psychologically warped whites.<br />Butler's prose is lean and muscular. She grips you from the stark opening lines: \\"I lost an arm on my last trip home. My left arm.\\" The story is richly ironic and heartbreaking. \\"Kindred\\" is a compelling 20th century literary descendant of such important 19th century slave autobiographies as \\"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass\\" and Harriet Jacobs' \\"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\\"; it is also a significant \\"sister\\" text to 20th century works (like Toni Morrison's \\"Beloved\\") which also revisit the era of slavery. But Butler's ingenious use of a classic science fiction device (i.e. time travel) sets the book apart from all of these other literary explorations of slavery. Whether for classrooms, book reading circles, or individual readers, \\"Kindred\\" is a triumph to be treasured.	2002-07-24

In these poems, Williams often takes a fresh look at ordinary things. His language is frequently quite arresting, and he often uses personification as a poetic device. Some of the most striking poems in this collection are as follows:<br />\\"Dawn,\\" with particularly memorable language (\\"Ecstatic bird songs pound / the hollow vastness of the sky / with metallic clinkings--\\"); \\"Smell!,\\" a wonderfully witty celebration of the speaker's own nose (\\"Oh strong ridged and deeply hollowed / nose of mine!\\"); the musical, mythic \\"Peace on Earth\\"; the haiku-like \\"Marriage\\"; \\"The Widow's Lament in Springtime,\\" a first-person narration by the title character; \\"Overture to a Dance of Locomotives,\\" which finds poetry in public transportation; \\"Winter Trees,\\" an excellent nature poem; \\"Complete Destruction,\\" an apocalyptic meditation on the death of a pet cat; and \\"The Thinker,\\" which has the charming opening lines \\"My wife's new pink slippers / have gay pom-poms.\\" Those are just a few of the poems in this collection.

The book features illustrations by James Sherman. As comedienne Rivers writes, Heidi was a tramp from day one: \\"She did things with her pacifier that most women still haven't done with their husbands.\\" The book has a copyright date of 1984, and the Dell paperback is dated 1985. It's good-natured, dirty fun.<br />The book charts Heidi's sexually promiscuous life from babyhood through elementary school, high school, and adulthood. Rivers covers such milestones as a sex-filled trip to Europe. Interspersed throughout the book are supplements like a page from Heidi's fouth-grade diary, a list of her favorite films (including \\"Easy Rider\\" and \\"Anything Goes\\"), etc.<br />Quite a bit of the humor stems from Heidi's tendence to spread sexually transmitted diseases. This is very much a pre-AIDS sex comedy, and the STD related humor may leave a bad taste in the mouth of some readers. Still, the book is entertaining, and Heidi comes off as a likeable free spirit who lives life on her own terms; she may have something in common with HBO's \\"Sex and the City\\" women. Besides, how could you not love a woman whose \\"body has been declared a national recreation area\\"? If you're in the mood, give \\"Heidi\\" a try.	2002-07-23

According to the introduction by William L. Andrews in the Signet Classic edition of the novel, &quot;Sport&quot; first appeared in &quot;Lippincott's&quot; magazine in 1901 and was published in book form a year later.<br />After a disturbing turn of events, the Hamilton family leaves their home in the southern U.S. and makes their way to New York City, where they try to start a new life. But the pressures of urban life have serious consequences for each member of the family.<br />&quot;Sport&quot; is a story about injustice, innocence, and temptation. As he follows this family's story, Dunbar looks at many different relationships: parent/child, husband/wife, black/white, etc. Particularly interesting is his look at the relationship between the media reporter and those who are the object of media reports. The book also presents an ironic view of artists and their connection to larger society.<br />&quot;Sport&quot; is a dark, moralistic tale. Although the characterizations are fairly shallow, Dunbar's narrative moves along effectively. I actually found the most intriguing character to be Skaggs, a white reporter for a &quot;yellow&quot; newspaper. This novel serves as an ironic complement to those slave autobiographies (such as the &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot;) which depict a flight to the north as a liberating experience; the north in &quot;Sport&quot; is a cold, amoral place full of dangers for black people. Overall, this is a compelling book that I regard as a significant milestone in African-American literature.	2002-07-22

Jenkins and Tim LaHaye, is number 5 in the \\"Left Behind: The Kids\\" series of short novels for young readers. \\"Nicolae\\" continues the overarching plot of the series, which is inspired by Christian fundamentalist theology. The book follows the adventures of a group of Christian teenagers during an age of apocalyptic mystery and horror. In \\"Nicolae,\\" the kids' high school is renamed (as indicated by the title) after a powerful world leader, and the faculty begins to implement a new agenda.<br />Like the other books in the series, \\"Nicolae\\" features corny dialogue and ridiculously melodramatic scenes. The message of \\"Nicolae\\" seems to be that religious diversity is a bad thing; for the book's heroes, the only legitimate viewpoint is a Christian fundamentalist viewpoint. Further, the book seems to foster Christian fundamentalist fantasies of persecution (the \\"us against the world\\" mentality). The idea that American public schools oppress Christian fundamentalists is a key theme here.<br />Actually, I found the most interesting aspect of \\"Nicolae\\" to be a couple of brief references to \\"Star Trek.\\" These references are ironic, considering the vast gulf between the vision of \\"Trek\\" creator Gene Roddenberry and the authors of the \\"Left Behind: The Kids\\" series. Approach the second of these two visions with caution.	2002-07-22

As the plot unfolds, Addy becomes jealous of the relationship between her older brother Sam and Daniel, a young boy who has recently moved to the city.<br />Porter tells her story well, and makes effective use of black vernacular English in the characters' dialogue. Like the other volumes in this series, this book includes an \\"About the Author\\" page and other educational supplements. The \\"Peek into the Past\\" section is an informative look at African-American churches in 1864. This article is illustrated with historic photos, and discusses such topics as the churches' relationship to the abolitionist movement. The \\"American Girls Pastime\\" supplement includes instructions on how to make letter cookies. Overall, a solid entry in a consistently enjoyable and educational series.	2002-07-22

The book is written as a sort of collage of fragments which follow four women from alternate Earths. One of these worlds is an earth where human males have not existed for centuries, and women have developed an all-female culture. Another world is very much like late 20th century Earth, except that World War II never occured. As the book opens, one of Russ' characters makes the weird journey between parallel Earths.<br />Interspersed throughout the story are tract-like explorations of femeinist doctrine. The best of these is a satire on the way in which women authors and their work are degraded and dismissed (perhaps Russ was cleverly anticipating her own critics, and blasting them beforehand).<br />I don't think the execution of the book fully lives up to its marvelous premise. Sometimes it's shrill and obscure. Still, at its best &quot;The Female Man&quot; is witty, intelligent, and biting. And Russ' explanation of alternate universes and time travel is coherent and compelling. Overall, a thought-provoking book that is definitely not just for science fiction fans.	2002-07-17

Thus, \\"Tropic of Cancer\\" is significant as a historical artifact in addition to being a literary work of art. The book tells the story of an American writer named Henry Miller who lives in Paris. Henry definitely lives in the seedy underbelly of the city; the book follows him to the bars, cafes, and whorehouses and details his encounters with a number of colorful characters.<br />\\"Tropic of Cancer\\" opens on a grungy note as the narrator discusses the lice infestation of his friend's armpits. Early on the narrator promises that this will not be a polite book: \\"This is libel, slander, defamation of character [...] a prolonged insult, a gob of spit in the face of Art.\\" Miller largely succeeds to deliver on this promise. The book is full of profanity, and there are frank discussions of sex, sexually transmitted diseases, and other such topics.<br />The book has a crude charm and energy throughout, even though at times the prose seems wildly self-indulgent. Miller depicts Paris as a magical place, a pilgrimage site for artists and wanderers. The narrator often reflects on writing and literature in general, and on his own artistic goals and theories in particular. There is also reflection on America and American identity. Miller's prose sometimes attains a Whitmanesque revelatory quality.<br />To me the main question about this book is thus: Is it merely an important historic artifact, or does it still sing as a work of living literature? My own reply to this question: the book does still sing, delivering (to quote the book itself) \\"bloated pages of ecstasy slimed with excrement.\\" If you like it, also check out the writing of Charles Bukowski.	2002-07-16

There is a lot of sex, profanity, and violence (with an emphasis on black-on-black violence). She also deals with such topics as gambling, illegal drugs, racial tension, and sexual dysfunction. The stories range from short 1- or 2-page character studies to the longest story, which is about 20 pages long. Throughout the book Coleman masterfully captures the rhythms of black vernacular English.<br />Some of the most vivid selections in the book are as follows: \\"Ladies,\\" about an encounter between two black women, a professional counselor and a woman mired in poverty; \\"The Scream,\\" a subtly horrific tale; \\"The Friday Night Shift at the Taco House Blues (Wah-Wah),\\" which is basically a slice from the life of an urban fast-food restaurant; and \\"Word Monkey,\\" a richly ironic story about a black writer of the pimp-and-junky genre. But the most stunning story is the longest one, \\"Big Dreams,\\" an intense study of a woman pursuing a dream.<br />With her raw, unapologetic style and subject matter, Coleman reminds me somewhat of Charles Bukowski, but her work is very much rooted in African-American female experience. But another author I would compare her to is Poe: many of Coleman's stories are truly horror stories. But her horror is not supernatural; rather, it is firmly rooted in urban reality, with its violence and socioeconomic pressure. Coleman is a writer from the edge whose work has real power.	2002-07-15

The text's copyright date is 1973. This book tells the story of Chester Hines, an African-American man who is arrested during a police traffic stop at the beginning of the novel. The bulk of the book details his experiences in prison.<br />Goines creates a vivid portrait of the lives of incarcerated men. He describes overcrowding, filthy conditions, violence, and other aspects of life behind bars. A major theme is the racially charged nature of prison life, with whites as an abused minority within the inmate population. Goines writes at graphic length about homosexual acts in prison; prison sex is always described in the most vile context.<br />Goines' writing is crisp, and the story moves along effectively. His characters are memorable and disturbing. Some of the social protest (starting with the hit-you-over-the-head title) seems a little forced. But this is definitely not a white-bashing book; there are a couple of sympathetic white characters, and in fact the most abusive and twisted characters are black! Overall, a fascinating look at a \\"community\\" (i.e. the inmate population) that most people will probably never experience directly. For another literary work that offers a gripping view of life in a racially mixed prison, try Miguel Pinero's great play \\"Short Eyes.\\"	2002-07-15

It is told by a first person narrator: married with 4 children, he is the art editor for a weekly periodical called \\"The Townsman\\" and lives in Avalon, Connecticut (40 miles from New York City). The narrator's life is complicated by his friendship with Augie Poole, a cartoonist who is more appreciated for his gags than his art. When Augie and his wife, Isolde, name the narrator and his wife as references at an adoption agency, the narrator becomes more involved in Augie's personal life.<br />\\"Tunnel\\" features gentle humor and likeable characters. I liked how De Vries juxtaposes the quest for parenthood with the quest to be taken seriously as a creative artist; it is a richly ironic pairing of themes.<br />De Vries has a wonderfully witty prose style. The book is full of great quotable quotes, like \\"We're the victims of our morality as much as our sins.\\" There are some really funny bits, such as this description of an adoption agency representative (from Chapter 1): \\"Mrs. Mash was a tall woman with a mouth like a mail slot and eyes the color of soy sauce.\\" De Vries masterfully mines humor from such settings as PTA functions or a church dinner.<br />\\"The Tunnel of Love\\" is a reflection on creativity, honesty, fidelity, and temptation. De Vries' talent speaks for itself; this is one writer who, I believe, deserves more attention.	2002-07-15

Oates' superbly crafted prose really brings you into a mind that is cunning and methodical, yet strangely childish. As Quentin narrates his bloody efforts to create a zombie, he also recalls formative events of his past.<br />\\"Zombie\\" contains many graphic scenes of horrific violence and sex. It is a story of psychological horror that reminds me of some of the work of seminal master Edgar Allen Poe. Oates' horror here is not supernatural, but based in the real phenomenon of the obsessive-compulsive serial murderer. The book is unsettling; what is Oates trying to say? How are we supposed to understand Quentin? But I think the troubling ambiguity is part of the brilliance of \\"Zombie.\\"	2002-07-09

It is also a world of wizards and dragons.<br />\\"Wizard\\" is a coming-of-age story that follows its hero, Ged, from boyhood to young manhood. Along the way he learns the craft of wizardry. This is a story of friendship and rivalry,  of arrogance and self-knowledge. A key concept is the equilibrium that true wizards strive for. Although the story is fantasy, I found Ged's journey to remind me somewhat of the journey of the hero of \\"The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,\\" another great coming-of-age story (although a real-life one). This indicates to me that Ged's story, despite its fantasy setting, is firmly grounded in real emotions and ethical concerns.<br />LeGuin has created a complete and compelling world. Masterfully woven into her narrative are geology, meteorology, linguistics, racial diversity, oral and written literature, dragon biology, and other aspects of this world. Her prose style is simple but elegant, often poetic and mystical; the book has a timeless, classic quality. If you only know LeGuin as the author of classic science fiction, \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" will reveal her to you as a master of the fantasy genre.	2002-07-09

Buck, is narrated in the first-person by its main character, Elizabeth MacLeod. Her narration begins from her home in rural Vermont in 1950. Elizabeth has been separated from her husband, Gerald, due to the poltical upheaval in China; he has remained in China to attend to his duties at a university. Gerald is the son of a Scottish-American and a Chinese woman.<br />As the novel unfolds, Elizabeth reflects on her past life with the absent Gerald. She also tells the story of her ongoing relationships with her and Gerald's son, Rennie; with Gerald's elderly father; and with other people in her life.<br />&quot;Letter&quot; is a fascinating look at how international political forces can act like a &quot;tidal wave,&quot; affecting families profoundly. The book is also an intimate look at a marriage from a woman's perspective, and a compelling study of a biracial young man (Rennie) who is struggling with his dual heritage while making the passage to manhood. There is also an element of political intrigue and danger, although the focus of this book is family relationships and emotions.<br />Although the dialogue is occasionally a bit stiff, overall I was very impressed by the subtle artistry of Buck's prose. She has an eye for details: an old man's dragon-headed cane, the birth of a calf, &quot;arching maple trees blazing with autumn fire,&quot; etc. At its best she attains a delicate, economical poetic prose. This is a fine novel by a writer who, in my opinion, deserves more attention.	2002-07-08

According to the copyright page, it was first published in 1957. The Norton edition contains illustrations by Michael McCurdy.<br />This short (55 pages) book tells the story of Yvonne, a young Irish woman who is being pressured by her mother and uncle to settle down and marry. But there is a disconnect between Yvonne's desires and the reality of her life. Towards the beginning of the story her uncle blames this on \\"the little novels she's for ever reading.\\" As the story unfolds, Yvonne embarks upon a pivotal night on the town with her boyfriend, Sam.<br />\\"Something\\" is an effective character study of a young woman at a transitional phase in her life. Murdoch's prose is as intriguing for what is not said as it is for what is said; she really challenged me to go past the characters' dialogue and to try to understand the unspoken thoughts that lay behind their words and actions. The perception of beauty is also a significant theme in this book.	2002-07-08

It consists primarily of alphabetically-arranged entries on selected writers. Each entry contains a list of books by the author, as well as a critical essay. This collection of writers is international and multicultural, although the selection is (as noted in the preface) limited to authors who write (or wrote) fiction in English and who have had major works published since 1960.<br />This is a book that I use both to \\"discover\\" authors I'm not familiar with, as well as to get new perspectives on authors I already know (either passingly or thoroughly). Each entry is about 1 to 2 pages long. A very short sampler of some of the authors covered: Chinua Achebe, Sherman Alexie, Saul Bellow, Charles Bukowski, Ian Fleming, Allegra Goodman, Ursula K. LeGuin, Amy Tan, Gore Vidal, etc.<br />The critical articles contain some questionable statements, but that's half the fun of this book: it's a reference work with which an intelligent reader can disagree.<br />In addition to the main entries, there is a series of sidebar book lists compiled by various individuals. Examples: \\"Five Contemporary Noir Classics,\\" listed by David Bowman; \\"A Walk on the Wild Side: Very Original Novels,\\" by Peter Carey; \\"Smart and Sexy,\\" by Erica Jong; etc. The books are listed with short descriptive paragraphs.<br />There is also a series of interspersed literary essays: \\"Every Novel Is a Lesbian Novel,\\" by Dorothy Allison; \\"Of This World: Why Science Fiction Can't Be Dismissed,\\" by John Clute; etc. If you love contemporary literature, you may find \\"The Salon.com Reader's Guide\\" to be a wonderful resource.	2002-07-06

Joseph flees Poland during the era of Nazi aggression. He comes to America but eventually embarks on a spiritual journey that brings him to Israel. This is a relatively short book (117 pages in a paperback edition).<br />\\"The Penitent\\" is masterfully written by Singer. The book actually consists of one story \\"nested\\" within another; the \\"frame\\" story is told by a first-person narrator, a writer who meets Joseph in Israel at the Wailing Wall. This brief frame story leads into the main part of the book: Joseph's first-person narration as told to this frame narrator. Thus the book could be read as an extended character study.<br />Joseph turns from worldliness to orthodox Judaism, and \\"The Penitent\\" is essentially the story of this spiritual journey. Joseph's story is fascinating. He is a very opinionated narrator, and although you may disagree with many of his declarations, I found his voice to be consistently compelling. In his story he touches on many significant issues: sexual and ideological temptation, the complex linguistic world of the Jewish people, the relationship of the Jewish Bible to rabbinical writings, vegetarianism, etc. The shadow of the Holocaust is a key theme in Joseph's story.<br />Throughout the book Joseph is a harsh critic of the modern world, especially of its literature and sexual values. Joseph has constant arguments with \\"the Evil One\\" throughout the book. Are these actual conversations with a demonic being, or just representations of Joseph's inner psychological state? Whichever they are, this device is used brilliantly by Singer. \\"The Penitent\\" is a richly peopled, remarkable work of fiction.	2002-07-05

The book jacket notes that it takes place in Harlem in the 1930s.<br />The illustrations are primarily in black-and-white, with a charcoal-like look. Superimposed on these illustrations are playfully surreal multicolored accents. The result is quite striking; the book has a visual style that bursts with fun and energy.<br />The illustrations capture many marvelous images: children dancing, a band jamming on a rooftop, a brilliantly lit-up city skyline, a trumpeter lit by streetlight. Duke Ellington is celebrated in the book's poetry: \\"Duke Ellington-- / King o' the sun. / Cool as a cat, / He's where it's at.\\" \\"Bring On\\" is an excellent celebration of American culture.	2002-07-02

The title comes from a line by John Donne. I may be committing literary blasphemy, but I do believe that ESVM writes better sonnets than even William Shakespeare!<br />\\"Fatal\\" is all about love, an emotion \\"like a burning city in the breast\\" (XXVI). The sonnets are full of passion, intelligence, and striking turns of phrase. There are a number of classical references (Helen, Troy, Aeneas, etc.). There are also many references to the natural world; the speaker claims to be \\"country-bred\\" (XLVI).<br />Millay writes of ecstasy, sorrow, loneliness, and the fear of time's ravages. This is a book that evokes \\"arrogant laughter and sweet lust\\" (XXXI), as well as \\"the desirous body's heat and sweat\\" (VII). The sonnet may be a centuries' old poetic form, but ESVM shows it to be still relevant and powerful.	2002-07-02

According to Cathy N. Davidson (who wrote the introduction to the Oxford edition), \\"Charlotte\\" was \\"America's first best-selling novel in the early years of the Republic.\\" According to the book's bibliographic notes, it was first published in 1791, with the first American edition appearing in 1794.<br />The book tells the story of an innocent young English schoolgirl who becomes involved in romantic intrigue. She eventually winds up in the vicinity of New York City; thus, the novel has an interesting theme of a foreigner coming to America. The book's plot reminds me of a contemporary soap opera, but with a much more judgmental and religious tone. The characters are, on the whole, cardboard stereotypes. The book is full of female hysterics, male villainy, cruelty, dangerous passion, and heartbreak.<br />Rowson fills her book with asides to the reader, and, ironically, I found this ongoing conversation to be more interesting than the melodramatic plot. Many of the asides are preachy, such as this example: \\"Oh my dear girls [...] listen not to the voice of love, unless sanctioned by parental approbriation\\" (chapter VI). But as the book goes on, Rowson begins to anticipate objections from possible readers, and some of her asides are witty and quite entertaining.<br />Ultimately, \\"Charlotte\\" is not a great piece of literature as a novel, but as a sort of metafictional exercise, it's quite intriguing. It's especially interesting when read in comparison with such self-referent 20th century novels as Ernest Hemingway's \\"The Torrents of Spring\\" or Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Breakfast of Champions.\\" Also, the book's presentation of 18th century femininity and sexuality is an interesting precursor to 19th century books like Harriet Beecher Stowe's \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\" \\"Charlotte\\" may try the patience of contemporary readers on certain levels, but I believe it to be a literary milestone that is still oddly relevant.ain levels, but I believe it to be a literary milestone that is still oddly relevant.	2002-07-01

The book tells the life story of Molly Bolt, a poor girl who comes from rural Pennsylvania. Molly narrates the book, which follows her to her adolescent years in Florida and to her life as a struggling film student in New York. Along the way, Molly lives her life as a sexually liberated young lesbian.<br />Molly is a wonderful character: a witty, intelligent combination of artist and trickster. The book is full of humor and satirical outrageousness. Molly is surrounded by a colorful cast of characters, most notably her strong-willed mother. The narrative as a whole is well-structured, and Brown brings Molly's story to a very satisfying conclusion.<br />As funny as \\"Rubyfruit\\" is, it also has some relevant insights on a number of issues: mother-daughter relationships, anti-gay prejudice, sexism in academia, socioeconomic barriers, etc. Molly's desire to be a filmmaker is a key theme: she is a creative individual who wants to tell relevant stories about \\"real people,\\" and not just impress some pompous group of cultural elites.<br />Brown's prose style is excellent: muscular, sexy, lively, humane, down-to-earth, and always enjoyable. For a good companion text, try Audre Lorde's \\"Zami,\\" a moving narrative of African-American lesbian life.	2002-07-01

Murphy's Law,\\" by Mark Baker, is a collection of cartoons that follow the career of the young soldier of the title. The cartoons in this book actually tell a continuous story: Baker follows Murphy from his interview with a recruiter, through Basic Training, and through other milestones in the life of a young soldier. Thus, the book could actually be read as a graphic novel.<br />I have served in the U.S. Army Reserve myself, and have been in a lot of the situations that are humorously depicted in this book. Baker's portrait of the Army is right on target, and very funny. Nearly half of the book is devoted to Murphy's experiences at Basic Training. It's especially entertaining to see new recruit Murphy responding to Army jargon as if it were a \\"foreign language\\" (as he calls it). Most of the key Basic Training elements are covered: first meeting with the drill sergeant, standing fire guard, going through the notorious gas chamber, etc.<br />Murphy himself is a likeable character. He looks a little like a young, thin Homer Simpson, and occasionally has \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\"-like flights of imagination. I especially like the fact that Baker makes Murphy on the whole a good, enthusiastic soldier. Baker generally goes for realistic humor, not ... unbelievable laughs.<br />The book is clearly geared towards an Army audience, and some non-veterans may be a little mystified at some of the Army jargon and abbreviations used throughout the book. But the overall charm of the book should overcome that potential cultural barrier. At any rate, \\"Pvt. Murphy's Law\\" would certainly make a great read for any veteran of the U.S. Army experience.	2002-06-22

The three books are bound together in one volume with separate pagination. Together they demonstrate Brautigan to be a witty, wacky, and altogether remarkable writer.<br />I actually found \\"Confederate General\\" to be the weakest of the three. This novel follows the misadventures of the impoverished narrator and his friend in California. It's a story, told with absurdist and satiric flourishes, of people on the fringes of society. I especially liked the narrator's unique approach to the biblical book of Ecclesiastes.<br />\\"Dreaming of Babylon\\" is a hilarious and delightful spoof of a hard-boiled detective novel. Brautigan's anti-hero, C. Card, is a poor, not-too-intelligent private eye working in San Francisco in 1942. Early in the book we learn that he is too poor to even afford bullets for his gun, and is hounded for rent by his landlady. His escape from this harried existence is an anachronistic fantasy life in ancient Babylon. This is a really fun book that effectively satirizes various popular entertainment genres. And despite being a lowlife, Card is a curiously appealing narrator.<br />The third novel, \\"The Hawkline Monster,\\" is a remarkable blend of horror, science fiction, western, and absurdist comedy. Taking place mainly in Oregon in 1902, the book follows the adventure of two assassins who are hired to kill the monster of the title. The book is full of quirky characters and bizarre situations. Brautigan creates genuine suspense, and his prose at its best is vivid and crisply poetic.<br />Brautigan's work in this trio of novels reminds me at times of the writings of Charles Bukowski and Kurt Vonnegut. But despite certain similarities to these two, I believe that Brautigan is a unique voice, and his work is a wonderful addition to the tradition of American fiction.	2002-06-22

Liu is adept at finding the intersection of the sacred, the political, and the sexual, and this 100-page collection of poems is a remarkable exercise of his voice.<br />Many of the poems in this book deal with death or other types of loss. He often uses religious imagery and allusions, and much of the book deals with gay male sexuality. There is a strong political flavor to much of this book, more so than in his collection \\"Burnt Offerings.\\"<br />Some of the poems that made the biggest impact on me are as follows:<br />\\"The Prodigal Son Writes Home,\\" a very in-your-face poem that marries graphic gay sex to religious imagery; \\"Power,\\" a meditation on society's fixation with the male sexual organ (it opens \\"Half the penis remains / from a man whose dong had been bitten off / by a dog\\"); \\"Billions Served,\\" a grisly poem about the inhumanity of the meat industry; \\"Oasis,\\" an ironic poem that takes place at the Walt Whitman Service Area, \\"off the Jersey Pike\\" (Whitman is also invoked in Liu's collection \\"Burnt Offerings\\"); \\"The Rand MaNally Road Atlas,\\" a humorous haiku with a homoerotic theme; \\"The Presence of Absence in a Midwest Town,\\" about hate crime and censorship in America; and \\"Against Nature,\\" a disturbing reflection on scientific inquiry into homosexuality.<br />Throughout the book Liu demonstrates his keen eye for sensory detail: he notices \\"dry kelp flaking off our soles like bits / of burnt confetti\\" (from \\"North Truro\\"), or the way \\"pigeons crown a stone Madonna smeared / with excrement\\" (from the multipart poem \\"A Baedeker\\"). For me, \\"Say Goodnight\\" confirms Liu's stature as an amazing contemporary poet.	2002-06-20

The back cover notes that the author is a Spokane/Coeur d'Alene Indian, and indeed the main topic of this book is American Indian life and literature. Although Whitman is invoked in one of the pieces (&quot;The American Artificial Limb Company&quot;), I found Alexie's voice in this piece to remind me more of Kurt Vonnegut and George Carlin. The book is a mixture of outrage, wacky humor, and tenderness, with some really cutting satiric elements.<br />Some of my favorite pieces are as follows. &quot;The Unauthorized Autobiography of Me&quot; is an excellent, irony-rich extended prose poem which looks at, among other things, the business and politics of Native American literary production. This piece contains the memorable line, &quot;Poetry = Anger x Imagination.&quot; &quot;Open Books&quot; is a satiric poem about poets and poetry itself. In this poem Alexie writes, &quot;Let us now celebrate the lies / that should be true because they tell us so much.&quot; &quot;The Mice War&quot; is an unsettling, violent poem that takes place on a reservation landfill. This is just a small sampling of the treasures in &quot;One Stick Song,&quot; a book which moves Alexie onto my list of favorite United States poets.	2002-06-20

Petruska, is an outstanding anthology dedicated to a very specific theatrical genre. It is part of a set of three volumes of 10-minute plays. One of the other volumes contains plays for 3 actors, and the other has pieces for 4, 5, or 6 actors.<br />The introduction to this book notes, &quot;Over the past two decades, the ten-minute play has established itself as a potent and durable form in American theater.&quot; The editors further compare this genre to other short literary forms such as the editorial. They also note that the plays in this volume are all by American playwrights.<br />The thirty plays are a very diverse group. In this book can be found comedy, tragedy, fantasy, and surrealism. Here are brief descriptions of some of my favorites.<br />&quot;Misreadings,&quot; by Neena Beber: an encounter between a college literature teacher and a rebellious student. &quot;Off the Rack,&quot; by Robert D. Kemnitz and Jennifer McMaster: a dialogue between a woman and a professional closet organizer. &quot;Guys,&quot; by Robert Badlam: a comic dialogue between a girl-hungry guy and his pal at a fast-food restaurant. &quot;Precipice,&quot; by William Mastrosimone: the suspenseful story of two climbers in trouble on Mount Rainier. &quot;Tape,&quot; by Jose Rivera: a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;-ish dialogue between a seemingly imprisoned individual and an attendant; early on this play contains the ominous line, &quot;We don't want to cause you an undue suffering.&quot;<br />But my favorite in the whole collection is &quot;Trying to Find Chinatown,&quot; by David Henry Hwang. A hilarious and thought-provoking satire on Asian-American identity, it contains some terrific dialogue.<br />The only thing that disappointed me about this collection was the lack of any author bios.

Still, this is a fine collection which I would enthusiastically recommend both for classroom use and personal reading.some information on these playwrights and on any other pieces they may have written.

Buck, is the true story of the struggle of the author after learning that her daughter Carol, born in 1920, was mentally handicapped. The 1992 Woodbine House edition contains a foreword by James Michener, an introduction by Martha M. Jablow, and an afterword by Janice C. Walsh, who was Pearl's daughter and Carol's's sister.<br />Jablow notes in her intro that \\"Child\\" first appeared as an article in \\"Ladies Home Journal\\" in 1950 and was shortly thereafter published in book form. Jablow notes that the book is \\"a landmark in the literature about disabilities.\\" As such, I consider \\"Child\\" a fitting companion text to a book like Helen Keller's \\"The Story of My Life.\\" Jablow notes that mental retardation \\"carried a shameful stigma\\" when Buck first had this story published; Jablow provides further useful historical context for the main text.<br />Buck writes very movingly of her heartache at the discovery of her child's plight. She documents her awareness of the stigma against people like Carol, and also tells of her search for an institution where Carol's special needs might be met. Buck passionately defends the humanity and worth of the mentally retarded, and tells what her experiences with Carol taught her: \\"I learned respect and reverence for every human mind. It was my child who taught me to understand so clearly that all people are equal in their humanity and that all have the same human rights.\\"<br />Walsh's afterword continues the story of Carol. She fills in some of the very obvious gaps in Buck's story. Walsh's contribution to this book is very moving, and includes photos of Carol.<br />In addition to being a work of historical and sociological importance, I found \\"The Child Who Never Grew\\" to be a moving and very personal piece of American literature. For another good companion text, try William Styron's \\"Darkness Visible,\\" in which the distinguished writer tells of his battle against clinical depression. Also, try \\"On the Way Home,\\" by Laura Ingalls Wilder; this book has additional material by Laura's daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, and like \\"The Child Who Never Grew\\" is thus a sort of mother-daughter literary collaboration.Way Home,\\" by Laura Ingalls Wilder; this book has additional material by Laura's daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, and like \\"The Child Who Never Grew\\" is thus a sort of mother-daughter literary collaboration.	2002-06-10

This may be misleading. Some historical perspective: In 1969, Senator Edward Kennedy was involved in a car accident which took the life of a young woman named Mary Jo Kopechne. Kennedy escaped the scene, but his behavior after the accident created a scandal which dogged him for years.<br />\\"Black Water\\" is a work of fiction which certainly brings to mind the Chappaquiddick incident. It opens with Kelly Kelleher, a young woman, in the car with an unnamed older man who is a senator. The car crashes into the murky black water of the book's title. The book as a whole consists of the thoughts swirling through Kelly's mind as she is trapped in the submerged car.<br />Kelly is certainly not Mary Jo Kopechne. For one thing, the time frame is all wrong. This book takes place in the early 1990s; Kelly has been a worker on Michael Dukakis' failed 1988 presidential campaign, and the Gulf War is mentioned. Still, the unnamed senator seems to be Kennedy. Thus, \\"Black Water\\" reads like a time-warped alternative history.<br />The book functions well as a character study of Kelly, and (indirectly) of the senator. We learn of Kelly's conflict with her parents, her sexual anxieties, and other issues. Oates uses vivid sensory details to bring Kelly's plight in the car to life. At times her prose attains a sort of frenzied poetry. Recommended as companion texts: \\"Daisy Miller,\\" by Henry James, and \\"Ariel,\\" by Sylvia Plath.	2002-06-10

Nothing is taboo in this book. He mines humor from the following subject matter: AIDS, blindness, obesity, hell, baldness, suicide, anal sex, eating disorders, demonic possession, crucifixion, homelessness, and evolution, among others.<br />Callahan's subject matter is well served by his ultra-crude drawing style. His grotesque human figures are ugly and misshapen (but oddly endearing!).<br />I'll describe two typical cartoons from this book. A female Grim Reaper, accompanied by two Reaper children, encounters a man giving away free puppies. The little Reapers excitedly ask, \\"Mommy! Mommy! Can we kill the puppies?\\" In another equally warped cartoon, a man is confronting his topless wife, one of whose breasts has been replaced by a pirate hook.

The back cover notes that this work was first written in 1930. It reads like an extended prose poem.<br />I found &quot;History&quot; to have an experimental flavor, but ultimately I found it largely incoherent. There are a number of cryptic or nonsensical statements on history. Examples: &quot;In history one does not mention dahlias mushrooms or hortensias&quot;; &quot;Intention is not history nor finality finality is not history. Think what is history&quot;; &quot;What is history it does not leave dogs for cows.&quot;<br />Stein's language is occasionally whimsical, musical, and/or absurd. One fun snippet: &quot;April is fully a holy day too / A holiday for a shoe.&quot; But overall, I didn't get much out of &quot;History.&quot; Check it out if you're a hardcore Steinian.	2002-06-09

Taking place in 1904, this book is part of the excellent \\"American Girls Short Stories\\" series of books for young readers. The story and supplements total about 50 pages.<br />Samantha is a 9-year old girl. She is visiting the \\"elegant town house\\" of the Pitt family, whose daughter Cornelia is engaged to marry Samantha's Uncle Gard. There is an unexpected mishap, but as the book's title indicates, the heroine \\"Saves the Wedding\\" with generosity and quick thinking.<br />This is a good story, although the whole society wedding motif is a bit frothy for my tastes (I prefer the grittier, more working-class vibe of some of the other books in this series). There are, as in the other books in this series, a number of fun and educational supplemental features, such as a \\"Meet the Author\\" page.<br />There is also \\"A Peek into the Past,\\" a supplement which looks at weddings and courtship in 1904; there are vintage photos and illustrations of historic items. The \\"American Girl Pastime\\" section gives instructions on how to make a tussie-mussie, which is a small bouquet whose flowers can carry symbolic messages. Overall, a worthy entry in a strong series for young readers.	2002-06-09

This children's book presents several of the classic parables of Jesus of Nazareth. The retold stories include the parables of the good Samaritan, the sower, the prodigal son, the unforgiving servant, and more.<br />The stories are retold with effective simplicity. Morris' artwork is truly wonderful; her warm, rich tones bring to life the Middle East of Jesus' era. Her human faces are full of emotion, and she is also masterful at illustrating sheep, a wheatfield, flatbreads, and other elements.<br />The only bad thing about this book are the preachy, hit-you-over-the-head afterwords that follow each retold parable. These stories are some of the world's great literature, and should be allowed to speak for themselves; for a children's book, they only need the accompaniment of great artwork.	2002-06-09

A significant part of the book reflects a gay Asian male perspective. There are a number of religious references and allusions, and a number of graphic evocations of gay sex.<br />The book is dominated by two longer poems, \\"With Chaos in Each Kiss\\" (13 pages long) and \\"Naked\\" (10 pages); these are tender, sad poems about the aftermath of a relationship between the speaker and a musician. I was intrigued by Liu's yoking of the motifs of performing arts and love. These two poems really read like they were written by someone who has been there and experienced such love and loss.<br />... Also noteworthy is \\"The Size of It,\\" a poem about body image, homosexuality, and Asian male identity; this poem has a flavor of painful honesty.<br />Even when at his most graphic and in-your-face, Liu writes with a poetic voice that is appealingly tender and gentle. I love his line, \\"Only love can make us visible\\" (from \\"With Chaos in Each Kiss\\"). Liu is definitely a poet worth exploring, and his work is a valuable contribution to American poetry, gay literature, and Asian-American literature. For an interesting complementary text, try Allen Ginsberg's \\"Cosmopolitan Greetings.\\"	2002-06-09

Alarcon. The poems are in Spanish; the book is presented in bilingual format, with English translations by Francisco Aragon. Most of the poems in the book are assigned Roman numerals instead of titles.<br />The book as a whole has a sad, thoughtful tone, but I found it ultimately hopeful. A number of poems are about loneliness and the desire for love. Consider the quote, &quot;could it be I'm the last person / on the face of the earth?&quot; (XXII). Some poems have a political edge; in one he asks &quot;how much for Central American coffee / that hums with bullet-ridden blood?&quot; (XX).<br />I found the strongest poems in the collection to be a trio that deal with words and language. In one of these three Alarcon writes that &quot;beneath this language there's another, / more ancient, agile, elusive&quot; (XVI). He seems to be pointing towards an ur-language that transcends language. Overall, a solid collection by an important Latino poet of the United States.	2002-06-08

The &quot;Scripture&quot; consists of a series of numbered, meditation-like prose poems that explore the concept of the Golden Eternity. The City Lights edition contains both a 1970 introduction by Eric Mottram and a 1994 introduction by Anne Waldeman. According to the publication data page, the Scripture itself was first published in 1960 (although the introductions note that it was composed earlier, in 1956).<br />The Golden Eternity is an enigmatic concept that seems to transcend rational thought; it reminded me somewhat of the Tao. Kerouac uses many paradoxical statements to explore the Golden Eternity; his writing is sometimes funny. He also plays with words, using such terms as &quot;the universal Thisness&quot; and &quot;the everlasting So.&quot; He even incorporates geometric symbols into one section of the Scripture.<br />Throughout are a multicultural constellation of references that give the Scripture a universalistic flavor. Buddha, Jesus, Shakespeare, Krishna, Kali, Einstein, and the Native American deity Coyote are just a few of the many references. He also finds insights in a butterfly, cats, and &quot;your little finger.&quot;<br />Kerouac writes, &quot;When you've understood this scripture, throw it / away. If you cant understand this scripture, / throw it away. I insist on your freedom.&quot; But whether you throw the book away, treasure it, or pass it on, chack out Kerouac's wonderfully written &quot;Scripture.&quot;	2002-06-08

This book is part of the American Poets Continuum series. There is a melancholy feel overall to this book. This tone is established in the first poem, \\"Pillow,\\" which mentions \\"discarded wings, lost shoes, a broken alphabet.\\"<br />A number of poems deal with death or other forms of loss. As a whole, the book is dominated by references to family members and relationships. The most memorable of these family poems is \\"The Hammock,\\" a poem that spans three generations; in this poem the speaker notes that he lives his life between \\"my mother's hopes\\" and \\"my child's wishes.\\"<br />The poem which made the biggest impact on me was \\"A Table in the Wilderness,\\" which is about the construction of ideographic characters from pictographic elements. Lee's thoughtful voice is quiet, but on occasion intriguing.	2002-06-07

The book's introductory essay notes that &quot;cult fiction is literature from the margins and extremes [. . .] offering a different angle on social reality.&quot; But they also caution that &quot;defining 'cult' is a risky business,&quot; and that ultimately &quot;'cult' is what people think it is.&quot;<br />Each entry briefly discusses the life and work of a &quot;cult&quot; author. Amusingly, every author is assigned a nickname. Examples: Kathy Acker, &quot;the pirate punk princess&quot;; Poppy Z. Brite, &quot;Post-punk Poe&quot;; Charles Bukowski, &quot; the dirty old man of American letters&quot;; Samuel R. Delany, &quot;The man who made sci-fi hip&quot;; Donald Goines, &quot;Daddy Cool&quot;; Yukio Mishima, &quot;masochistic militarist&quot;; Mary Shelley, &quot;The woman who created a monster&quot;; Kurt Vonnegut, &quot;Where (Groucho) Marxist tendencies meet Kafka&quot;; Jeanette Winterson, &quot;The lioness of lesbianism.&quot; The group of authors is eclectic, international, and multicultural.<br />The book is illustrated throughout with author photos and reproductions of book covers. The main text is also interspersed with a series of interesting lists. Examples: &quot;N is for Noir: 10 original pulp classics from the hard-boiled school&quot;; &quot;O is for oracle: 5 novelists whose predictions have come true.&quot; Although I'm sure readers will bemoan the absence of favorite cult authors from this gathering, &quot;Cult Fiction&quot; is still a richly entertaining and informative reference work.	2002-06-07

A number of characters from \\"Land\\" also reappear in \\"Ozma\\": the Saw-Horse, Ozma (of course!), etc.<br />\\"Ozma\\" is full of fun, fantastic characters. Tiktok, the mechanical man, is an interesting complementary character for Baum's Tin Woodman. But my favorite character in \\"Ozma\\" is probably Billina, the feisty talking hen. She's funny, smart and heroic. \\"Ozma\\" is further proof of Baum's genius as a storyteller of the realm of the fantastic.	2002-06-05

With that in mind, the book is unsettlingly prophetic in its depiction of a media driven, controversy-plagued religious movement; it's almost as if Vidal had looked into the future and seen the coming era of televangelists and death cults.<br />\\"Messiah\\" is told in the first person by Eugene Luther, a key figure in the rise of the Cavite movement. This new religion is founded by John Cave, who preaches the simple message that \\"it is good to die.\\" Vidal uses a very effective narrative device: Luther is an older man who alternates between narrating his current life in exile and the birth if the Cavite movement 50 years previously. Thus, the reader essentially gets two parallel stories of the same man at different stages in his life.<br />\\"Messiah\\" could be read as a sort of science fiction novel: one based not in the physical sciences, but rather in a flight of fancy derived from concepts from the social sciences. Vidal's novel is flawed in that the Cavite movement is not fleshed out enough to be wholly convincing. But what's here is indeed intriguing. Vidal looks at the creation of the new religion's scriptures, infighting among the new faith's inner circle, etc. He ultimately considers some big questions, such as the plasticity of history in the service of dogma. And the book is very much a reflection on religion in the United States; one character notes that \\"America is particularly known for religious maniacs.\\"<br />I think of \\"Messiah\\" as one of a group of literary works that look at the creation of imaginary new religions. As companion texts, I recommend Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Cat's Cradle\\" and Tony Kushner's 2-part play \\"Angels in America.\\"	2002-06-05

The Dover edition includes a short introduction; it notes that the book was initially published in 1914.<br />&quot;Tender Buttons&quot; is divided into three sections: &quot;OBJECTS,&quot; &quot;FOOD,&quot; and &quot;ROOMS.&quot; The first two sections are further subdivided into short entries: &quot;A RED STAMP,&quot; &quot;A BOX,&quot; &quot;A PLATE,&quot; etc. Thus it seems like Stein is presenting the poetic version of a series of still lifes.<br />Stein often uses repetition, alliteration, and other rhythmic techniques. She totally liberates her compositions from standard syntax and punctuation. Words are strung together in odd combinations. Ultimately she creates a playful, even musical dance of words across the pages.<br />But I must admit I found this dance largely incoherent. It often reads like some pidgin variant of English, or like the writings of someone who has suffered a neurological trauma to the language center of her brain. I could also compare it to some sort of secret code language of an occult society.<br />Examples of the style in this book: &quot;Apple plum, carpet steak, seed clam, colored wine, calm seen, cold cream, best shake, potato, potato and no no gold work with pet, a green seen is called bake and change sweet is bready, a little piece a little piece please&quot; (from &quot;APPLE&quot;); &quot;A curving example makes righteous finger-nails&quot; (from &quot;ROOMS&quot;).<br />The book as a whole has an experimental feel, and while I'm not sure how successful the experiment is, &quot;Tender Buttons&quot; is nonetheless quite a remarkable work. At times it's even fun. My suggestion: read sections of the book aloud to someone who does not speak or understand English, and ask them how the pure musicality of the language strikes them.	2002-06-03

LeGuin's classic \\"The Left Hand of Darkness.\\" Each novel envisions an alien society in which gender and sexuality differ radically from that of the ordinary human world. Ives' vision is as bold and as fully realized as that of LeGuin, and daringly different on certain levels.<br />The heart of Ives' story takes place on the planed Gammadis, where a neuter third gender, known as Blands, serves as a slave population to the males and females that comprise the rest of the population. The situation is further complicated by the fact that all children of Gammadis are essentially neuter, with gender not manifesting itself until puberty. The story opens with Tedla, a Bland refugee from Gammadis, meeting a xenologist from another world. Tedla tells \\"its\\" life story to the sympathetic Val.<br />\\"Halfway Human\\" is a gripping drama filled with political intrigue and populated by a fascinating group of characters. Gilman fully fleshes out the complex culture of Tedla's world. The novel deals with such compelling issues as prejudice, slavery, sex, power, and the relationship of an underground subculture to a dominant culture. The story also looks at education and empowerment, hypocrisy and lust, and the longing for a love that transcends vast gulfs of difference.<br />There are some really horrific and painful scenes in this story, but there is also much that is life-affirming. \\"Halfway Human\\" is a brilliant contemporary fictional version of a slave narrative, a genre which has played an important role in American literature; good companion texts for this novel would be such 19th century works as \\"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass\\" or Harriet Jacobs' \\"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.\\"	2002-06-02

For the uninitiated, these strips follow the adventures of grammar school boy Calvin and his stuffed tiger, Hobbes; the latter character literally comes to life in Calvin's fertile imagination.<br />A number of recurring C&H storylines and motifs are part of this collection: Calvin's ongoing battle against no-nonsense babysitter Rosalyn; Calvin's curious love-hate relationship with a little girl named Susie; Calvin's role as a grammar school underachiever. There are many other amusing storylines: Calvin trying to learn to ride a bicycle; his learning to appreciate classical music; etc.<br />But my favorite storylines are the sort of science fictionish plots where Calvin's imagination runs wild: Calvin turning himself invisible; his becoming \\"immune to the force of gravity\\"; his shrinking to insect size; etc. Probably the funniest of these out-there plots involves Calvin's \\"transmogrifier,\\" a device worthy of any mad scientist. Hobbes is always along for each mishap, offering moral support and wry commentary.<br />C&H could be read as a satire on education, culture, politics, and literature. Calvin is a classic comic strip character. At times very much like a real little boy, at times like an adult philosopher trapped in a child's body, he's a consistently engaging figure, and is perfectly complemented by Hobbes. And although the accent in this book is on humor, there is an unexpectedly poignant storyline in which Calvin comes to the aid of an injured baby raccoon.<br />At one point in the collection Calvin declares \\"I try to make everyone's day a little more surreal.\\" Thanks to his creator Watterson, he succeeds brilliantly.	2002-05-31

I knew that this book was special when I got to the third poem, \\"The Kitten.\\" This poem about a stillborn kitten stopped me dead in my tracks. Painful yet beautiful, tragic yet transcendent, it sets a powerful tone for the collection as a whole.<br />And \\"American Primitive\\" does indeed strike me as a unified whole. It consists mostly of poems about American wildlife, with some poems that touch on people in United States history. The poems are often about the cycles of life, including birth, death, and loss. In some poems eating becomes a transcendent act that points to the connectedness of all life.<br />Oliver writes about mushrooms, blackberries, crows, egrets, deer, snakes, whales, and other living things. She also writes about such natural phenomena as snow and sunlight. Her language is often striking and sensuous. I love the lines from \\"Spring\\" where she says \\"The rain / rubs its shining hands all over me.\\" With her attentiveness to the natural world, Oliver reminded me somewhat of Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, but she really has a voice and vision all her own in \\"American Primitive.\\"	2002-05-31

Books	4	7	7	N	N	Mystical reflections on poetry	Lawrence Ferlinghetti's &quot;What Is Poetry?&quot; consists of s series of statements, rendered in free verse, which reflect on the nature of poetry. According to a note at the beginning of the book, the roots of this text go back to an oral version recorded in the 1950s. The statements often have a mystical flavor; reading the book is like reading a sort of postmodern scripture. Examples of the statements:<br />&quot;Poetry is news / from the frontiers of consciousness&quot;; &quot;A poem should arise to ecstasy / somewhere between speech and song&quot;; &quot;Words are living fossils / The poet should / piece the wild beast together / and make it sing&quot;; &quot;Poetry is religion / Religion is poetry.&quot;<br />Many of the sayings are quite striking and thought-provoking; the most intriguing of them invite re-reading and reflection. Overall the book makes a fascinating complement to a more conventional prose work about poetry (like Mary Oliver's &quot;A Poetry Handbook&quot;).<br />If there is a flaw to this book, it is that many of Ferlinghetti's statements are, I believe, not just applicable to poetry, but to any form of good writing. Consider, for example, when he writes &quot;The poet is a subversive barbarian / at the city gates / constantly challenging / our status quo.&quot; I think that such a statement is also true about many writers of prose or drama; thus such a statement doesn't necessarily offer any special insight into what distinguishes poetry from these other forms. Still, I really like this book and recommend it to readers, writers, and teachers of poetry.	2002-05-29

According to a &quot;Note on the Text&quot; in the Penguin Classics edition, this book first appeared in 1846 in no less than four different editions.<br />&quot;Typee&quot; is a marvelous story of cross-cultural contact. It is also a fascinating glimpse at a pre-industrial culture; Tom (known as &quot;Tommo&quot; to the Typees) describes in detail the food, dress, tattooing, physiology, musical instruments, architecture, warfare, religious practices, and social customs of the Typees. The book is full of vividly portrayed characters: the gentle beauty Fayaway, the &quot;eccentric old warrior&quot; Marheyo, the talkative &quot;serving-man&quot; Kory-Kory, and more.<br />Melville's prose style in &quot;Typee&quot; is irresistible: the writing is fresh, lively, and richly descriptive. There is a satirical thrust to much of the book. And there is a lot of humor; at many points I literally laughed out loud. Such scenes as the description of a wild pig's frustrated efforts to break open a coconut really showcase Melville's comic flair.<br />A major theme of &quot;Typee&quot; is that of the &quot;noble savage&quot; (Melville actually uses the term). The narrator often wonders whether Typee life is in some ways better than Western life, and is quite critical of the work of Christian missionaries among Pacific Island peoples. The book is richly ironic, as Melville's narrator reflects on the problematic nature of cross-cultural observation: &quot;I saw everything, but could comprehend nothing&quot; (from Chapter 24).<br />&quot;Typee&quot; is more than just a colorful travelogue or a philosophical reflection; it is also a genuinely exciting and suspenseful adventure story. Melville's story of a visitor to a strange alien world curiously anticipates a major theme of 20th century science fiction; thus a novel like Ursula K. LeGuin's &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; would make a fascinating companion text. Also recommended as a companion text: &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,&quot; another 19th century American classic which casts a critical light on Eurocentric Christianity.l like Ursula K.

This volume, which is written by Janet Shaw and illustrated by Renee Graf, focuses on Kirsten, a ten-year-old girl whose family had emigrated from Sweden to Minnesota about a year before this story takes place. In this book, Kirsten becomes jealous of Nora, a new girl at school; Nora's family is from Norway.<br />\\"Kirsten and the New Girl\\" ultimately teaches some worthwhile lessons as Kirsten comes to know more about Nora. The story includes a number of supplemental features, such as a \\"Meet the Author\\" page. A supplement entitled \\"A Peek into the Past\\" takes a look at girls' friendships in 1854, the time frame of Kirsten's story. This supplement includes reproductions of homemade dolls, historic photographs, and other items from that time. The book ends with an instructional article on how to make a friendship pillow. Overall, an enjoyable and educational book which, at about 50 pages, will be ideal for readers at a certain skill level.	2002-05-29

It opens with the title character playing his flute. Jabuti wants to play his instrument at a festival for the King of Heaven, but another creature's jealousy leads to conflict.<br />The fun story is brought to life by McDermott's superb artwork. His brightly colored illustrations have a highly stylized, almost surreal quality that I found very engaging. I loved the pictures of Jabuti, as well as those of the birds, trees, flowers, jaguar, and tapir. Dominated by bright pink and shades of green, the pictures really excite the eye. A charming book.	2002-05-28

The story focuses on Arturo Bandini, a teenager who is the eldest of the family's three sons. His father, Svevo, is a bricklayer and an immigrant to the United States. Very Americanized, Arturo loves baseball and is tormented inside over his family's poverty.<br />Fante richly develops the relationships among the members of this often dysfunctional family. He also vividly evokes the experience of raising a family in poverty. Particularly interesting is Fante's portrayal of Roman Catholicism within the life of the Bandini family; religion is shown to be a very ambiguous force. There are some dark, even cruel episodes as the family's story unfolds.<br />As much as I enjoyed &quot;Wait,&quot; I did not find it in the end to be as satisfying as the other Fante novels which I have read (&quot;1933 Was a Bad Year&quot; and &quot;Full of Life&quot;). Still, it's a powerful family story that is graced by Fante's excellent prose style.	2002-05-28

According to the back cover blurb, &quot;Torrents&quot; was first published in 1926. The short novel tells the story of the intertwined lives of World War I veteran Yogi Johnson and writer Scripps O'Neill, both of whom work at a pump factory.<br />I think of &quot;Torrents&quot; as a metafiction: a work of fiction that reflects on its own creation as a work of fiction. The story is interspersed with authorial asides to the reader in which the narrator comments on the process by which the story was written, and sometimes makes specific pleas to the reader. These asides are often ridiculous and funny. Example: &quot;If any of the readers would care to send me anything they wrote, for criticism or advice, I am always at the Cafe du Dome any afternoon.&quot; This metafictional flavor is further enhanced by the frequent references to various American authors: Henry James, Willa Cather, Gertrude Stein, etc.<br />The story itself contains some whimsical and surreal scenes. Hemingway offers a curious presentation of race and gender issues; in particular, there are a number of Native American characters. Recommended as companion texts: the also very metafictional &quot;The Things They Carried,&quot; by Tim O'Brien, and &quot;Breakfast of Champions,&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut.	2002-05-28

(Quality))	Books	5	5	6	N	N	An enjoyable and thought-provoking SF anthology	I had high hopes for &quot;Science Fiction: The Best of 2001,&quot; the anthology edited by Robert Silverberg and Karen Haber. The main reason I was so enthused about the book was due to the presence of science fiction legend Silverberg as co-editor; I figured, &quot;This guy knows sci-fi.&quot; Well, I was not disappointed. &quot;2001&quot; is a marvelous collection of 11 tales about humans, extraterrestrials, robots, and/or genetically engineered creatures.<br />My favorite tales in the anthology are as follows: Michael Blumlein's &quot;Know How, Can Do,&quot; told in the first-person by a genetically engineered &quot;chimeric life form&quot;; Richard Wadholm's &quot;From Here You Can See the Sunquists,&quot; about a couple's visit to a town that is enveloped by a temporal anomaly; Robin Wayne Bailey's &quot;Keepers of Earth,&quot; the story of a devastated earth, abandoned by humanity and populated by robots; Michael Swanwick's &quot;The Dog Said Bow-Wow,&quot; in which a genetically engineered superdog has an adventure in a future London; Nancy Kress's &quot;And No Such Things Grow Here,&quot; which opens with the protagonist learning that her sister has been arrested for GMFA (Genetic Modification Felony Actions); and Dan Simmons's &quot;On K2 with Kanakaredes,&quot; the rather touching story of an interspecies mountain climbing expedition.<br />But the best story in the collection, in my opinion, is Jim Grimsley's haunting &quot;Into Greenwood.&quot; This tale takes place on a planet where neutered, genetically altered humans serve as symbionts for a race of intelligent trees. &quot;Into Greenwood&quot; is a superb blend of a compelling sci-fi concept, great character development, and wonderful descriptive writing. I recommend &quot;Science Fiction: The Best of 2001&quot; both for pleasure reading and as a classroom literature text.	2002-05-27

The book focuses on animal parenting and social organization. Animals covered include the glasswing butterfly, sloth, scorpion, giant millipede, Wilson's bird of paradise, bats, gorillas, and more. The main text is accompanied by a glossary, an index, a map showing the world's main rainforest areas, and a list of Web links and addresses for conservation organizations.<br />I really liked the stunning, full-color photos in this book. Some of the best images include a fight between two male strawberry poison-arrow frogs; a \\"writhing ball\\" of anacondas; the intricately woven nest of a white-throated spoonbill; and a multicolored male knobbed hornbill. A great book for young animal lovers.	2002-05-27

Throughout the book Cisneros revels in a sort of \\"bad girl\\" image: the overall persona is that of a passionate, sexual woman who's had her share of both joy and disappointment. At times she sounds like a Latina soul sister to Charles Bukowski and Allen Ginsberg.<br />The book is mainly in English, but peppered with Spanish words and phrases; there is one poem entirely in Spanish (\\"Amorcito Corazon\\"). Cisneros writes about love, womanhood, Latina identity, and creativity.<br />Some of my favorite selections from \\"Loose Woman\\": \\"You Bring Out the Mexican in Me,\\" a Whitmanesque celebration of both the speaker's lover and of her own ethnic identity; \\"Dulzura,\\" with the memorable opening line \\"Make love to me in Spanish\\"; \\"Down There,\\" which celebrates menstruation with vibrantly graphic language; and the title poem, in which the speaker declares \\"I break laws, / upset the natural order.\\"<br />The book is throughout spiced with a colorful medley of multicultural references: Dolores del Rio, Nebuchadnezzar, Mohammed, Houdini, the gargoyles of Notre Dame, Sir Walter Raleigh, Marilyn Monroe, etc. Cisneros' language is often raw and sexual, sometimes playfully elegant; I loved her phrase \\"the origami of the brain\\" (from \\"Night Madness Poem\\"). Definitely a worthwhile collection of poetry from an intriguing Latina voice.	2002-05-27

The book is illustrated by Jack E. Davis. In this installment, schoolboy Zack has an appointment with his new orthodontist, Dr. Sheldon Jekyll. Zack is a little spooked because the doctor has the same last name as a character in a famous horror story. And when Zack goes under the laughing gas, strange things start to happen. Is it only a gas-induced hallucination, or is Dr. Jekyll hiding a horrific secret?<br />\\"Dr. Jekyll\\" has its share of humor and chills, but overall I did not find it to be one of the stronger books in the series. Sheldon Jekyll just didn't have as much \\"bite\\" (sorry about the pun!) as some of the many other memorable characters in the series. Still, recommended for \\"Zack\\" fans.	2002-05-27

Cummings, George James Firmage notes that the title is derived from a Greek word whose simplest transliteration is &quot;khi-ra&quot; (with accent on the first syllable). Firmage further notes that the book was published by Oxford in 1950.<br />Xaipe is a curious collection of sequentially numbered poems. Many of the poems are very visually oriented; Cummings plays with with word division, punctuation, and the arrangement of words on the page. He often warps and reshapes language like a sculptor using clay; reading some of these poems is like deciphering a series of strange hieroglyphics.<br />Much of the book is also ear-oriented. Cummings demonstrates his mastery of rhyme, meter, alliteration, and repetition. He even includes a number of sonnets; sonnets, that is, as channeled through his experimental sensibility.<br />The tone of the book varies: cynical, satiric, revelatory, even tender. Cummings often uses seemingly invented words: &quot;livingest&quot; (from poem #1); &quot;unteach&quot; (#5); &quot;fingeryhands,&quot; &quot;whying&quot; (#14); etc.  One of my favorite poems is #22, a sonnet that begins &quot;when serpents bargain for the right to squirm.&quot;<br />But is there an overall theme to &quot;Xaipe&quot;? I'll leave that to each reader to answer. But I sensed in the book as a whole a distrust of officialdom and a wariness of war, and a sense of skepticism about humanity; I felt at times that Cummings was resisting the rationality and formality of language and seeking a pure experience and attentiveness that actually transcends the written or spoken word.<br />&quot;Xaipe&quot; feels like a prolonged experiment, and while the experiment may not be wholly successful, it is nonetheless marked by flashes of genius. Definitely a volume of poetry worth exploring. For a stimulating companion text, try something by the philosopher J. Krishnamurti.	2002-05-27

But I found the most striking recurring theme to be that of aging. Ginsburg writes very movingly of the physical and emotional ramifications of growing older. Mentioned a number of times in the book is Walt Whitman, whom Ginsberg acknowledges as his poetic forefather: \\"I write poetry because Walt Whitman gave world permission to speak with candor.\\" Also cited are Blake and Pound.<br />Some of my favorites in this collection: \\"Improvisation in Beijing,\\" a Whitmanesque chant on why Ginsberg is a poet; \\"Sphincter,\\" both a bawdy ode to the poet's title orifice and a celebration of gay sex; the title poem, \\"Cosmopolitan Greetings,\\" a rather Blakean series of mystical declarations (example, \\"Inside skull vast as outside skull\\"); \\"Personals Ad,\\" a poem in the form of a personals ad by an older poet seeking a young male lover; \\"Yiddishe Kopf,\\" a celebration of the speaker's Jewishness; \\"Put Down Your Cigarette Rag (Dont Smoke),\\" an anti-smoking piece that attacks big tobacco companies and their politician allies; and \\"Everyday,\\" a haiku-like poem about a lama.<br />Throughout the book Ginsberg uses a nember of different poetic forms, some of which I have already mentioned. Other forms include songs (complete with musical notation), a letter, and even a comic strip. The book is often outrageous, often tender, and sometimes quite funny.	2002-05-25

A lean 84 pages, this is a straightforward and eloquent book.<br />In an author's note, Styron explains that this book started out as a lecture given at a symposium sponsored by the Department of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The lecture was developed into a \\"Vanity Fair\\" essay before ultimately becoming this book.<br />Styron describes depression as \\"an insidious meltdown\\" of the mind, a \\"tempest in my brain.\\" He reflects on the depression and suicide of other individuals whose lives had touched his. He describes in detail his own struggle with suicidal thoughts. Also covered are the medications he took, as well as his hospitalization and therapy.<br />Styron's book is both a fine piece of literature and a very informative window into a particular mental illness. Styron has been in the pit of despair, but has survived; I commend him for his courage and candor in sharing his experience in \\"Darkness Visible.\\" Recommended companion text: Audre Lorde's \\"The Cancer Journals,\\" about a poet's battle with breast cancer.	2002-05-25

The book also includes the following: (1) an essay, written by Carole Kismaric, on his life and career; (2) a chronology of his life (1894-1985); (2) a list of his major exhibitions; and (4) a bibliography.<br />Kertesz' black-and-white photos include many scenes that are haunting, touching, or whimsical. I especially like his street scenes, which capture everyday people. His many photos of Paris life in the 1920s and 30s remind me of the writings of Henry Miller (see, for example, Miller's \\"Tropic of Cancer\\").<br />Some memorable images: a young boy in Paris holding a delicate-looking puppy; a wandering violinist on a street in Hungary; a snowy view of Washington Square; a grubby old man urinating on a street in Paris; a portrait of an imperious Colette. There are some witty captures, particularly one delightful shot of umbrella-wielding pedestrians on a Tokyo street. Kertesz had a keen eye and a marvelous sense of composition; this book is a visual treat from start to finish.	2002-05-24

In the book Oliver, herself an excellent poet, gives a clear and painless introduction to some structural aspects of poetry. She defines many technical terms: alliteration, onomatopoeia, alexandrine, caesura, quatrain, persona, etc. She also discusses various poetic forms: sonnet, free verse, etc. Other topics addressed include imagery and diction. Throughout the book, Oliver illustrates her points with poetry by some of the greatest practitioners of the craft: Robert Frost, Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams, Elizabeth Bishop, etc.<br />The book is aimed at both readers and writers of poetry. For the latter, Oliver reflects on such practical issues as revision and participation in poetry workshops. The book reflects Oliver's own philosophy of poetry. She stresses that poetry is a craft that requires work and discipline, and encourages the reader to think of poets as constituting a &quot;tribe&quot; that transcends all geographic and cultural boundaries.<br />The book is not without flaws. I found it quite Eurocentric; she never discusses the haiku, a Japanese verse form that has been embraced by many in the English-speaking world. Other non-Western forms are similarly neglected.<br />Some of her opinionated pronouncements also seem open to debate. She notes that a poem &quot;gives pleasure through the authority and sweetness of the language,&quot; but I think some poems are effective conduits of rage or outrage and make use of unpleasant language to shake up the reader. Regarding the revision process, she notes that sometimes &quot;it is simply best to throw a poem away&quot; -- but, I ask, who is to make that decision? Something a poet might want to discard may in fact be a great poem in another's eyes.<br />Also, although she gives many good examples of good poems, it might have been interesting if she had included some bad ones to illustrate her points further.<br />Despite its flaws, however, I think that &quot;A Poetry Handbook&quot; would be a solid text for both individual reading and classroom use. And I think that some of Oliver's questionable statements could trigger productive discussion! Ultimately, I appreciate Oliver's declaration that poetry &quot;is a life-cherishing force [...] as necessary as bread in the pockets of the hungry.&quot; Recommended as companion texts: Audre Lorde's essay &quot;Poetry Is Not a Luxury,&quot; from her collection &quot;Sister Outsider,&quot; and Pablo Neruda's prose collection &quot;Passions and Impressions.&quot;urther.<br />Despite its flaws, however, I think that &quot;A Poetry Handbook&quot; would be a solid text for both individual reading and classroom use.

Categorized as \\"4-F,\\" Chinaski doesn't serve in the military and instead wanders from city to city, from one odd job to another. Along the way Bukowski describes his run-ins with the police, his sexual adventures, and his drinking.<br />I found \\"Factotum\\" to be episodic and to lack the focus and impact of Bukowski's excellent novel \\"Post Office,\\" also featuring Chinaski. But \\"Factotum\\" is still a good read with some really stunning passages. Bukowski seems to be deromanticizing the \\"myth of the starving artist,\\" which he calls a \\"hoax,\\" in this book. I only wish that \\"Factotum\\" featured more about Chinaski's vocation as a writer; I found the parts of the book that focused on his identity as a writer to be the most interesting parts.<br />\\"Factotum\\" is particularly interesting in its context as a novel of the World War II era which deals with the U.S. homefront, but in an entirely unromantic and detached way. Bukowski's prose is often quite vivid; one encounter with a rather scary prostitute is a particular gem of Bukowski's raw, in-your-face style. Overall, a solid work by one of America's most distinctive writers.	2002-05-16

Thomas Pynchon's novel \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\" is an often funny gem of absurdist fiction. It follows the odd quest of Oedipa Maas, the wife of a California disc jockey. As the story begins, she is made executor of the will of Pierce Inverarity. This responsibility leads her to seek the truth behind a centuries' old international conspiracy. Along the way, she encounters a number of weird characters and bizarre historical revelations.<br />Part of the fun of \\"Lot\\" is the wild jumble of cultural references that Pynchon throws into the mix: a Tupperware party, Cornell University, Muzak, Fu-Manchu, Perry Mason, LSD -- and those are all from the first chapter! He tosses about such names as Warpe, Wistfull, Kubitschek and McMingus (that's a law firm). His whimsical characters include a former child star-turned-lawyer, a specialist on Jacobean revenge tragedies, and a proselytizer for the Peter Pinguid Society.<br />\\"Lot\\" reflects on such topics as U.S. history, pop culture, religion, politics, and mail delivery. It's strange, inventive, brainy, and fun. Recommended as companion texts: \\"Principia Discordia\\" and Charles Bukowski's \\"Post Office.\\"	2002-05-16

Johnson uses various techniques throughout the book: dialogue, monologue, third person narration, diary entries, a letter. This variety of form helps keep the book interesting throughout.<br />Johnson deals, either directly or indirectly, with a number of important names from U.S. and Caribbean history: Frederick Douglass, Martha Washington, Toussaint L'Ouverture, and others. The topics of the individual stories are varied; they include passage on a slave transport ship, black soldiers fighting for the British during the Revolutionary War, the pursuit of a fugitive slave, and more. My favorite story, &quot;Poetry and Politics,&quot; is an intriguing fictional dialogue between groundbreaking African-American poet Phillis Wheatley and her mistress.<br />Overall, this is a solid collection which would, in my opinion, be good both for classroom use (high school and college) and for individual reading. My recommendation: read it alongside relevant works by such 18th and 19th century authors as Douglass, Wheatley, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Henry David Thoreau, and others.	2002-05-15

This may be as much due to the details of her life as to her work. But putting the \\"legend\\" of Plath aside, I found her book \\"Ariel\\" to be quite an intriguing collection of poems.<br />There are many mentions of death in general and suicide in particular throughout \\"Ariel.\\" The dark, cutting nature of many of the poems make them feel like glimpses of Plath's inner torment; also, a number of the poems seem to challenge conventions regarding traditional female roles in society. Structurally, many of the poems have an engaging musicality and demonstrate a witty use of rhyme and other effects.<br />Many of the poems have a grimly playful quality. Plath uses a strange, unsettling constellation of images and allusions: \\"Mein Kampf,\\" the Ku Klux Klan, rubber breasts, carbon monoxide, schizophrenia, the Vatican, etc. There are some really arresting turns of phrase.<br />Some of the most striking poems include the following: \\"The Applicant,\\" a disturbing satire of marriage; \\"Lady Lazarus,\\" in which she writes \\"Dying / Is an art\\"; \\"Tulips,\\" a horrific vision told by a hospitalized woman (this one is reminiscent of Charlotte Perkins Gilmans' classic story \\"The Yellow Wall-paper\\"); \\"Lesbos,\\" a glimpse into the unfulfilling lives of two mothers; \\"Daddy,\\" a frightening hate-letter from the speaker to her father; and \\"Balloons,\\" a playful but edgy poem about balloons.<br />In the poem \\"Kindness,\\" Plath writes, \\"The blood jet is poetry, / There is no stopping it.\\" So many decades after Plath's death, it appears there is no stopping her poetic voice.	2002-05-15

The book features a number of familiar Peanuts motifs and themes, such as Lucy's psychiatric stand and her endless flirtation with Schroeder. Overall, there are a lot of Snoopy and Woodstock strips. The book also takes us through some of the high points of a Peanuts year: the first day of school, Halloween, Christmastime, etc.<br />There are a few dated cultural references (Rod McKuen, Bobby Hull, etc.) but overall the strips have that timeless Peanuts appeal. There are some characteristically wonderful moments, such as Linus' epiphany after building a snowman. And of course, the Charlie Brown/Snoopy relationship remains one of the best \\"boy and his dog\\" relationships ever created.	2002-05-07

Uchida tells the story of her family, which includes her Japanese-born parents and her sister. After the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan and the outbreak of World War II, the family endures the fate suffered by many other Japanese-Americans: they are forced to abandon their home and are relocated to an internment camp in Utah.<br />This is a powerful story of injustice, racial prejudice, endurance, and family devotion. Uchida creates a vivid portrait of the internment camp: &quot;an artificial government-spawned community on the periphery of the real world. . . a dismal, dreary camp surrounded by barbed wire in the middle of a stark, harsh landscape that offered nothing to refresh the eye or heal the spirit.&quot;<br />Despite the unpleasant and often humiliating conditions, it is amazing how many residents worked to create a liveable community with a viable infrastructure. I was intrigued by Uchida's account of the Christian faith of her mother. Also fascinating is Uchida's deconstruction of the Big Brother-ish language used to mask the true nature of the internment program.<br />The book includes many photos of the family and other camp residents. Uchida also discusses her own mother's vocation as a writer of tanka (31 syllable Japanese poems), and includes translations of some of these poems. This enhances the literary quality of the book.<br />&quot;Desert Exile&quot; is told simply but with great eloquence. The book is, in my opinion, a wonderful contribution to the multi-ethnic literary tradition of the United States.

It is the story of the title character: a Vermont-born Civil War veteran who rises from humble beginnings to make a huge fortune in the paint business. With his wife and two daughters, Lapham lives in Boston. Despite his wealth, he is keenly aware of the gulf that exists between him and the city's aristocratic \\"old rich.\\"<br />The book has a quality that seems to anticipate the TV soap operas that became popular in the 20th century: it is a story of intertwined romantic and financial intrigue. Howells pays particular attention to people's attitudes about social manners.<br />Overall, this is an entertaining and interesting evocation of a time of growth and change in the United States. The characters are well-drawn, and Howells keeps the plot moving along. There is an interesting continuing theme of the relationship between \\"real\\" life and novels; for example, George Eliot's \\"Middlemarch\\" is cited a number of times by characters in the book. For an interesting complementary text to \\"Silas Lapham,\\" try Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle.\\"	2002-05-07

In Brin's future humans, together with genetically modified, intelligent chimpanzees and dolphins, have established themselves as an interstellar spacefaring race. &quot;Startide&quot; deals with an adventure of the &quot;Streaker,&quot; a starship manned by dolphins, humans, and one chimpanzee scientist. After making a monumental discovery, the &quot;Streaker&quot; is pursued by hostile aliens and takes refuge on the water world of Kithrup, where interpersonal struggles and further discoveries await them.<br />This is a fascinating portrayal of a complex multispecies community. Brin deals interestingly with the implications of genetic engineering and language as he explores the relationships among the ship's diverse crew. A central idea in Brin's tale is the concept of Uplift: that each intelligent species had a &quot;patron&quot; race that raised it to sentience, thus creating a chain of interspecies relationships that binds together galactic civilization. Brin fills the book with intriguing characters, action, technical information, and plot twists.<br />Overall, I enjoyed, and was even enriched by, &quot;Startide Rising.&quot; But I did feel at times that Brin was packing into the book perhaps a little too much minutia for minutia's sake; it seemed like he was just trying too hard to create a Tolkienesque total world. And at times his prose got rather overripe, and seemed almost like a parody of a science fiction novel. But these flaws aside, &quot;Startide&quot; is a fascinating novel with a lot to offer the serious science fiction fan.	2002-04-28

He sets out to save Beasley's Pond, in the town of Janice, from destruction by polluters. The story follows both his quest and his active love life, weaving his life together with those of a number of other people: an environmental crusader, an amorous doorman, and more.<br />The book has a pretty straightforward story, but throughout there is a slightly weird feeling; some parts of the book have a quality that reminds me of a David Lynch film. The book takes a brief and oddly unsatisfying detour into the subject of bisexuality. Overall the book is OK--it held my attention, but didn't do much more than that, although Cheever's prose style is often quite lovely. Give it a try.	2002-04-28

The story follows his experiences at the post office, weaving them together with his accounts of romantic affairs, sexual encounters, drinking, and gambling. Chinaski's life is full of encounters with various unsavory, tragic, or ridiculous characters.<br />\\"Post Office\\" is the ultimate \\"I hate this job\\" story. It's also an intriguing, and highly unflattering look at a quintessential American institution. Bukowski's prose style is crude, rude, and raw; often very funny, sometimes shocking, and sometimes poignant. But always highly readable. Bukowski effectively evokes a vision of a mind-numbing, soul-killing workplace that is ruled by a petty bureaucracy.<br />On one level, \\"Post Office\\" seems to have much in common with a classic \\"social protest\\" novel like Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle,\\" which also portrays the suffering and degradation experienced by the working person. But ultimately, \\"Post Office\\" seems like another species of novel altogether. Bukowski tells his story in a matter-of-fact style; he doesn't seem to care about offending or impressing anyone, and seems to offer no social agenda. He just tells it like it is. A fascinating book by an author who, I increasingly believe, is truly in a class all his own.	2002-04-19

The book follows the experiences of Jack, Tristessa, and their circle of friends in the seedy underside of Mexico City.<br />Kerouac's language in this book is startling: a prose poetry that reminds me of Allen Ginsberg's poem \\"Howl.\\" The words in \\"Tristessa\\" tumble at you in a wild, hypnotic rush. There are lots of apparently made-up words, sort of \\"Spanglish\\" flourishes, and pop culture references. Buddhism serves as a frequent subtext to the novel; I would recommend reading this together with Kerouac's \\"The Scripture of the Golden Eternity.\\"<br />\\"Tristessa\\" is a sad look at the human toll taken by drug abuse, and is full of vivid details of the title character's world. Recommended as a companion text: \\"Quiet Days in Clichy,\\" by Henry Miller.	2002-04-19

This is one of many details in which the character's life mirrors that of the author. But whatever the degree to which &quot;Life&quot; is autobiographical, this is a very engaging, well-written novel.<br />The narrator of &quot;Life&quot; is an Italian-American writer living in Los Angeles with his pregnant wife, Joyce. As the novel follows the course of Joyce's pregnancy, John deals with Joyce's shifting emotional moods, her growing interest in Roman Catholicism (from which John himself has fallen away), and termite infestation in the house. All of this is further complicated by John's problematic relationship with his father Nick, a retired bricklayer who isn't shy about sharing his own strong opinions about family life.<br />This book is truly full of life: it is a richly realized blend of comedy and drama, and is peopled by a vividly realized group of characters. I especially loved old Nick Fante: stubborn but loving, devoted to his family and to his craft, and a rich source of Abruzzian folk beliefs.<br />&quot;Life&quot; is also noteworthy as a novel which really takes religion seriously, acknowledging both the emotional power and problematic nature of Roman Catholicism for many Italian-Americans. &quot;Full of Life&quot; is ultimately a very moving story of family ties, and a noteworthy contribution to the multi-ethnic literary heritage of the United States.	2002-04-17

It tells the story of Daniel, a little boy who is experiencing his first day at preschool. Daniel and his family are all elephant-headed humanoids; the other kids in his class include a hippo, a pig, a cat, etc. This device is nicely used and gives the largely realistic book an appealing touch of fantasy.<br />The friendly illustrations have bright colors.

A \\"Carolrhoda Nature Watch Book,\\" it is packed full of information. Subjects covered include the animals' geographic range, anatomy, and life cycle. The book also discusses both the prey the salmon seek and the predators which in turn try to eat them. Especially interesting are the comparitive chart of different salmon species, and the information about conservationists' efforts to help salmon.<br />The book is full of excellent full-color photos. Many of the photos are quite striking, such as one of a bald eagle feasting on a dead salmon. The book also includes a glossary and index. Overall, a good book, and especially recommended for young children with an interest in marine life.	2002-04-15

While his father, an out-of-work bricklayer, seeks to alleviate the family's poverty by earning money at the pool tables, Dominic dreams of becoming a successful baseball player.<br />\\"1933\\" is a superb slice of American life; both funny and sad, the book is full of vivid characters and memorable scenes. Probably may favorite character is Dominic's wrathful, acid-tongued grandmother, an Italian immigrant with a dislike for the United States.<br />\\"1933\\" offers a pungent taste of the Italian-American experience, and explores such issues as the gulf between immigrant parents and their American-born children. Baseball is a potent motif in the book, and I liked the way the left arm of pitcher Dominic is treated as a \\"character\\" with its own motivation. This is one of those novels that I wished would go on when I finished the last sentence; I will definitely be reading more of Fante's work.	2002-04-14

As the title indicates, it is about a single woman who adopts a child. This is a straightforward story that celebrates the adoptive mother/child bond.<br />There are a lot of good points about this book. But reading it made me ponder many questions that go unaddressed. What does the mom do for a living? Who shares in the co-parenting duties when the mom is at work? The picture seems a bit too idealized and \\"politically correct.\\"<br />Still, there is much to admire here. I like how the author shows that a single mom can provide her child with male figures in an extended circle of family and friends. And the artwork is truly beautiful: bursting with color and skillfully rendered detail. Scenes such as a soccer game and a trip to the zoo are wonderfully brought to life. Overall, a commendable effort.	2002-04-10

Sargent. This is a short book (57 pages), but powerful. The story, which takes place in 1936, opens by announcing that Lieutenant Shinji Takeyama, a Japanese army officer, has committed ritual suicide together with his wife Reiko. &quot;Patriotism&quot; tells of the days leading up to and including the double suicide.<br />This is a simple story, but in its simplicity lies great artistry. Mishima's prose, as interpreted by Sargent, is striking, vivid, and ultimately quite beautiful. &quot;Patriotism&quot; is a tragic love story that is rich in eroticism. The graphic, violent details will, I imagine, shock and even disgust some readers, but I found this story to be ultimately a haunting, and strangely compassionate, work of art.	2002-04-10

LeGuin, is a science fiction novel that takes place in humanity's future. In LeGuin's universe, the various offshoot races of humanity have discovered each others' civilizations on many different worlds, and have united in a sort of commonwealth known as the Ekumen. \\"Left Hand\\" focuses on the mission of Earth-born Genly Ai to the planet Gethen, where he serves as the Ekumen's first formal envoy to the planet.<br />Like any ambassador/explorer, Ai faces a degree of culture shock. But his experience is complicated by an extraordinary Gethenian quality which makes them unique among the human races: they are hermaphrodites -- each one with both female and male potential -- and have a remarkable sexual cycle that has radically shaped their culture.<br />The sexual element in \\"Left Hand\\" may sound like a sci-fi \\"gimmick,\\" but it is not. It is, rather, one aspect of a complex and brilliantly realized total tapestry that is the world of Gethen. LeGuin adeptly weaves together geology, anthropology, folklore, politics, history, sociology, and alternative theologies as she creates a totally compelling and believable world. And as important to Gethen as its people's unique sexuality are the harsh climate and landscape: the world is in the grip of a fierce ice age.<br />LeGuin constructs this story with superb intelligence and artistry; one technique she uses skillfully is the incorporation of multiple narrative voices. Again, this is no \\"gimmick,\\" but is a well-woven part of the whole novel.<br />\\"Left Hand\\" is many things: a brilliant feat of the imagination; a political thriller; a harrowing tale of adventure and survival; and a deeply moving personal drama. It is a book written with keen insight and profound compassion: a book which daringly asks what it means to be human, what it means to love, and what it means to have a vision for humanity. Not only is \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" one of the essential classics of science fiction, it is also, in my opinion, one of the great novels of the 20th century.t is also, in my opinion, one of the great novels of the 20th century.	2002-04-08

Frank Baum, could be read as a sequel to the film. Three of the film's most important characters -- the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and good witch Glinda -- are important characters in this book (although Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion do not appear).<br />Baum creates a marvelous cast of new characters to interact with the three familiar ones mentioned above. Central to this story is Tip, a young boy whose unhappy life with a mean witch will probably remind some readers of Harry Potter's less-than-ideal home life with the Dursleys. Tip's escape from the clutches of the witch Mombi is the start of a fantastic adventure that leads him to the fabulous Emerald City, to an encounter with an all-female army led by a bold conqueress, and to relationships with the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and a host of equally fantastic beings.<br />The new characters are really great, but probably my favorite is Jack Pumpkinhead, an artificially-constructed, pumpkin-headed being brought to life by magic. Jack has a childlike innocence that I found quite endearing. Also memorable is the ornery but courageous Saw-Horse, another magical being.<br />There is a curious undercurrent of subversive gender politics to the book; although the main party of adventurers are male, the most powerful characters in the book are ultimately its female characters (both heroic and villainous). And one jaw-dropping plot twist (which I will not ruin by revealing!) furthers this theme.<br />This book is quite simply a wonderfully delightful story, well-told by Baum and superbly complemented by John R. Neill's whimsical illustrations. And despite the fact that it's a fantasy, I felt that the book has some relevant real world themes, most notably the ideas of respecting diversity and valuing \\"unusual\\" folks. And the friendship between the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman is especially heartwarming. \\"The Marvelous Land of Oz\\" is a great classic for both adults and young people.ially heartwarming. \\"The Marvelous Land of Oz\\" is a great classic for both adults and young people.	2002-04-03

Ultimately he gets involved with the colorfully warped family of scientist Dr. Felix Hoenikker, a weapons technology researcher. The narrator's quest takes him to the Caribbean island republic of San Lorenzo and to an encounter with Bokononism, the remarkable religion that has been outlawed on San Lorenzo. And driving much of the story is the secret of Ice-Nine, a scientific discovery with horrific destructive power.<br />Above is the bare-bones outline for a richly-peopled, tremendously imaginative exploration of human arrogance and frailty. \\"Cradle\\" is filled with brilliant motifs and details. From the San Lorenzan dialect to the details of Hoenikker family history, the book is a wonder. But possibly the best part of the book is Vonnegut's rich realization of Bokononism: its scriptures, rituals, and lexicon are intriguingly revealed throughout the book.<br />\\"Cradle\\" is full of unforgettable scenes of both horror and whimsy, all brilliantly capture by Vonnegut's amazing prose.

Shadow uncovers a bone. But the bone turns out to have paranormal powers, and soon the little dog is having a hair-raising encounter with a bunch of dinosaurs!<br />The paranormal element to the story is very well done, and gives the book a \\"Twilight Zone\\" meets \\"Jurassic Park\\" feel.

Greenburg creates some fun supporting characters (most notably Yoda-like Chinatown sage Grandma Guy) and fills the story with clever, memorable details. And it's all superbly complemented by Davis' hilarious drawings.	2002-03-28

The book is filled with Vonnegut's own quirky illustrations.<br />&quot;Breakfast&quot; is harsh, even cruel, but also tender and compassionate; it's laugh-out-loud funny, yet haunting and tragic. It's also a reality-warping metaphysical triumph; Vonnegut breaks down the barriers between reality and fiction, and invites the reader into the very process of the novel's creation. He creates a more intimate bond between author, reader, and fictional character than any other writer I can think of.<br />Vonnegut presents some of American literature's most memorable characters in &quot;Breakfast.&quot; But my favorite is undoubtedly Trout. Throughout the book we also get glimpses of Trout's own voluminous body of work, and meet some of his bizarre sci-fi characters. The book as a whole is also enriched by Vonnegut's unique style; he writes as if for an extraterrestrial audience to whom humanity is utterly alien.<br />&quot;Breakfast&quot; is a profane, naughty, yet profoundly spiritual book. Filled with strange and vivid details, it's an oddly comforting modern-day testament for our fractured world. Thanks, Kurt.	2002-03-28

The fun story by Dan Greenburg is complemented by the cleverly humorous illustrations of Jack E. Davis. In this installment, New York City schoolboy Zack goes to stay at Camp Weno-wanna-getta-wedgee for some summer fun. But he soon finds that the camp is haunted by talk about Bigfoot, the legendary, hulking hairy humanoid. Is Bigfoot real? Will Zack encounter him?<br />This book is an enjoyable blend of paranormal thrills, humor, and preteen social politics. There is one aspect of the book which, however, didn't work for me. One character describes the camp's ridiculous trivialization of Native American motifs as \\"politically incorrect.\\" I got the sense that author Greenburg was trying to have it both ways: on one hand, mock the PC watchdogs, and on the other hand, be PC himself by mocking those those who exploit ethnic motifs in a trivial way. The result left me a bit uneasy. But if you can get past that, you may find \\"Bigfoot\\" to be an enjoyable romp.	2002-03-28

The back cover notes describe it as \\"ficto-journalism and journo-fictionalism,\\" and also observes that the book \\"began as a series of [...] ninety-second interludes for New York's public radio station.\\"<br />The book is presented as a series of reports from the afterlife; according to Vonnegut, controversial assisted suicide advocate Dr. Jack Kevorkian guided him through controlled near-death experiences, during which Vonnegut interviewed a series of dead individuals: abolitionist John Brown, convicted murderer Karla Faye Tucker, beloved sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov, scientist Sir Isaac Newton, etc.<br />Along the way Vonnegut touches on such topics as humanism, slavery, genocide, ballooning, writing, and more. There are a number of curious revelations about the afterlife, such as the fact that Louis Armstrong leads a band which includes two Tasmanian musicians. \\"Dr. Kevorkian\\" is whimsical, cynical, irreverent, and altogether enjoyable.	2002-03-26

The story is told in the first-person by Raheim Rivers, a Black gay man who is starting to hit it big as an actor and model.<br />\\"Eazy-E,\\" which takes place in 1995, deals with many issues: AIDS and the anxiety over HIV testing; gay love between African-American men; gay fatherhood; images of black men in the media; attitudes about homosexuality and AIDS in the Black community; and the sociological impact of the O.J. Simpson murder trial. In a broader sense, it deals with such universal issues as family ties, honesty and personal fidelity.<br />The book is flavored with a lot of African-American pop-culture references: Al Sharpton, the documentary \\"Hoop Dreams,\\" the film \\"Malcolm X,\\" the TV series \\"Living Single,\\" etc. Hardy has an intriguing way of rendering African-American vernacular speech; thus he joins a long list of literary artists who have taken on this challenge. He presents a rich assortment of characters.<br />According to the acknowledgment section of the book, \\"Eazy-E\\" is \\"yet another chapter\\" in the lives of the book's characters (i.e. the book is part of a series). I haven't read Hardy's other books, and at times I felt that \\"Eazy-E\\" seemed to rely too heavily on the assumption that the reader was already familiar with the characters' back stories. So it might be better to read Hardy's previous novels before jumping into \\"Eazy-E.\\" Still, for an attentive reader this might work as a stand-alone book.	2002-03-26

The editors note in their preface that with the 1955 overthrow of Eva's husband, President Juan Peron, much visual material related to this controversial woman was destroyed. Thus, this book has significant historical and sociological value.<br />We see the full span of the woman's extraordinary life: Eva as a child, aspiring actress, wife, and triumphant first lady. There are \\"glamour shot\\" portraits, candid photos, magazine covers, stills from film productions, and more. We see Eva and her husband, as well as her interaction with adoring crowds.<br />Eva is a consistently fascinating subject: whether fiery, starry-eyed, thoughtful, amused, determined, or serene, you can see why she continues to captivate so many imaginations.<br />The text portions of the book are very positive towards Eva. If you have been intrigued by the Broadway musical and motion picture about her life, or by other media about her, I definitely recommend this book.	2002-03-18

The book focuses on the topic of Asian-American identity. Issues include the following: being an \\"ABC\\" (American-born Chinese), being the son of an immigrant, defining \\"Chineseness,\\" the birth of \\"[t]he Asian-American identity,\\" and the fallout from the \\"Asian money\\" political scandals of the 1990s. More personal topics include an account of his own father's battle against kidney disease.<br />Liu writes a very readable prose. Many of his ideas are provocative, and could, I imagine, spark some lively debate. I was intrigued by the parallels he drew between Asian-American experience and that of other minority groups (Jews, gays and lesbians, Hispanics), and also by his distinction between biculturalism and omniculturalism. Definitely useful reading for the Tiger Woods millennium. For a fascinating companion text, try \\"Blood, Bread, and Poetry,\\" by Adrienne Rich, or \\"The Fire Next Time,\\" by James Baldwin.	2002-03-17

Books	5	20	20	N	N	Tongue twisters, Seuss style	\\"Oh Say Can You Say?\\" is a collection of tongue twisters from the fertile pen of the great Dr. Seuss. Each twister is accompanied by Seuss's characteristically whimsical illustrations. The collection is introduced by a frazzled-looking parrot named Hooey.<br />\\"Oh Say\\" contains Seussian imaginary creatures (the Schnak, the Grox, etc.) and silly characters (\\"a musical urchin named Gretchen von Schwinn,\\" the acrobatic Fuddnuddler brothers, etc.). Along the way are such tongue-torturing phrases as \\"Skipper Zipp's Clipper Ship Chip Chop Shop.\\" The colorful illustrations, as one might expect from Seuss, are bursting with surreal energy. Overall, a lot of fun, especially if you love rhyme and alliteration.	2002-03-17

Jenkins and Tim LaHaye, is volume #4 in their \\"Left Behind: The Kids\\" series of short novels aimed at young adults. This book, like the previous ones in the series, represents an attempt to turn the apocalyptic beliefs of Christian fundamentalists into fiction. Unfortunately, the result reads like a too obvious evangelical tract.<br />The book focuses on four kids and their pastor who are living during the \\"Tribulation,\\" a period after all fundamentalist Christians have been mysteriously taken off the earth. As this volume in the series unfolds, suspicion grows that United Nations leader Nicolae Carpathia is in fact the Antichrist: the prophesied evil one.<br />Much of this book is unbearably corny, and it even reads at times like a parody of religious fiction. One of the more ridiculous scenes involves a character using a flip chart to explain the biblical Book of Revelations to his followers. The book has a creepy, intolerant tone to it; various non-Christian philosophical paths, for example, are trivialized.<br />\\"Facing the Future\\" is a failure as a work of literary art. And in my case, it also failed as an evangelical tract. But I think the book may have some merit as a window into a Christian fundamentalist worldview.	2002-03-13

Karim and Mohammad Mehdi Khorrami, is an excellent anthology which greatly enriches the world of ethnic American literature. The pieces in this collection deal with many issues: language, biculturalism and the anxieties of assimilation, family ties, male-female relationships, Islamic fundamentalism, the role of Zoroastrians as a religious minority, war and its aftermath, etc. Although many such issues are specific to Iranian-Americans, others are universal to all &quot;ethnic&quot; Americans. The stories take place in both Iran and the United States, and one even takes place in France.<br />Some of my favorite pieces in this book include the following: &quot;Made You Mine, America,&quot; Ali Zarrin's joyful poem which invokes both Walt Whitman and Langston Hughes; Mariam Salari's humorous short-short story &quot;Ed McMahon Is Iranian&quot;; Ramin M. Tabib's story &quot;Tuesdays,&quot; about two Iranian-Americans in the L.A. club scene; Nazanin Sioshansi's essay &quot;The Suffocating Sense of Injustice,&quot; about Zoroastrians in Iran; and Siamak Namazi's fascinating essay &quot;Finding Peace in the Iranian Army,&quot; about an Iranian citizen who returns to fulfill his military obligation after living in the United States.<br />&quot;A World Between&quot; really opened my eyes to some of the pain and beauty of the world(s) of Iranian-Americans. This anthology would be ideal both for classroom use and individual reading.

In BIBBA, Rylant recalls her childhood and adolescence in West Virgina. The book opens with her mother's separation from Cynthia's alcoholic father. Rylant goes on to discuss her extended family, her friendships, her heroes, her youthful sexual awakening, etc.<br />One intriguing aspect of the book is the way Rylant reveals how people and issues from her childhood eventually were reflected in her works of fiction. This is a short book, but well complemented by 16 pages of photos and documents from Rylant's childhood. Rylant's style is frank and direct, yet also demonstrates grace and tenderness. Overall, a fine book.	2002-03-10

This tragedy stimulated debates on anti-gay prejudice and violence. \\"The Laramie Project,\\" by Moises Kaufman and the members of the Tectonic Theater Project, attempts to find meaning in the murder and its aftermath.<br />Kaufman and the other members of the theater group travelled to Laramie, Wyoming, which was the focal point of the Matthew Shepard tragedy, in order to interview the people of the town. As the play's opening states, the dialogue of the play is drawn from these interviews as well as from other sources. Thus the play's language has a raw authenticity. Many different voices are heard: a policewoman, Matthew's father, a Catholic priest, a lesbian college professor, Matthew's killers, a Unitarian minister, a viciously anti-gay protestor, etc.<br />An interesting aspect of the play is the presence of Tony Kushner's play \\"Angels in America\\" as a sort of \\"background\\" text. \\"Angels\\" is mentioned more than once in this play, and indeed, there are significant parallels between the two texts. I recommend that people read both of these remarkable works.<br />Many issues are addressed in \\"Project.\\" One character notes that \\"we need to own this crime.\\" This play is a not only a morally challenging attempt to deal with a high profile tragedy, but also a compelling work of art.	2002-03-05

Rather than rely on shots from the film, the book primarily uses still shots that appear to have been purposefully taken for a project like this. This was, in my opinion, a wise choice, since I have noticed that the photos in other movie tie-in books can sometimes be a bit murky. The photos here are crisp and colorful, and really allow you to analyze and enjoy the details.<br />The text comes in the form of easy-to-digest nuggets. The book covers characters, ships, weapons, clothing, robots, animals, and other elements from the movie. The text offers intriguing little tidbits of info about the SW universe (although I imagine that more devoted fans may argue about how &quot;canonical&quot; this info is).<br />A nice aspect of the book is the fact that barely glimpsed elements in the film are given loving attention here. For example, you can &quot;meet&quot; the members of the Jedi Council more intimately. I liked the comparative size chart of Naboo sea monsters. And the fashion-oriented will have a great time exploring the ornate costumes worn by Queen Amidala and others. Overall, this book is a lot of fun.	2002-02-23

According to the author bio at the end of the book, Harjo is a member of the Creek (Muscogee) Native American nation, and grew up in Oklahoma and New Mexico. Much of this book reflects this heritage: &quot;We were a stolen people in a stolen land&quot; (from &quot;Autobiography&quot;).<br />&quot;In Mad Love&quot; contains many cultural and historical allusions embedded in a complex web of surreal imagery and autobiographical-sounding fragments. Harjo seems to be trying to transcend both linguistic and cultural barriers; she notes that &quot;All poets / understand the final uselessness of words&quot; (&quot;Bird&quot;). She does not only focus on the Native American experience; she also has a number of African-American cultural references. She takes us, among other places, to a prison riot in West Virginia and a political discussion in Nicaragua.<br />Although I found some of the book opaque when I first read it, I found &quot;In Mad Love&quot; to be very rewarding on second and third readings. Harjo's language is often quite startling, and achingly beautiful. Much of the book seeks to find a link between the contemporary urban experience and the world of myth and nature. Throughout the book are many references to animals: the trickster Rabbit, &quot;iridescent dragonflies,&quot; &quot;a / turtle's nose above water,&quot; etc.<br />Harjo writes of flooding the city &quot;with a revolutionary fire&quot; (&quot;City of Fire&quot;), and indeed the book does have a strong political flavor. Her melding of political commitment, intimate passion, myth, and multicultural awareness makes &quot;In Mad Love and War&quot; a demanding and intriguing read.	2002-02-19

The book is actually adapted from a speech which Walker gave to the Midwives Alliance of North America at Albuquerque, New Mexico, on September 22, 2001.<br />Walker is a prolific and versatile African-American author, and having read much of her poetry and prose, I found \\"Sent by Earth\\" to be very much in tune with her work to date. Walker doesn't just discuss the September 11 attacks in this text. Her other topics include the history of racist oppression in the United States (\\"American Apartheid\\" as she calls it), female genital mutilation (which she wrote about in her book \\"Possessing the Secret of Joy\\"), African cultural tradition, the deaths of Iraqi children since Operation Desert Storm, the Taliban's oppression of women in Afghanistan, and more. Along the way she writes with admiration of such individuals as U.S. Congresswoman Barabara Lee and Buddhist peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh. At the heart of Walker's book seems to be the question, \\"How do we reclaim a proper relationship with the world?\\"<br />\\"Sent by Earth\\" struck me as somewhat fragmented, as not fully formed. Nevertheless, Walker's passion for justice, compassion for other human beings, and multicultural vision shine through.	2002-02-18

In his preface, Price explains the book's origin: he had received a letter from Jim Fox, a young medical student who was fighting cancer. Fox had apparently been intrigued by Price's account of his own battle with a disabling cancer, an experience recounted in Price's book &quot;A Whole New Life.&quot; Fox wrote to Price seeking his insight.<br />Price writes from the perspective of a faithful Christian of the liberal Protestant variety. Price writes of his own &quot;revelations&quot; of God's presence, his family's multidenominational Christian background, and other issues. He quotes and reflects on many biblical passages (both Old and New Testament) and also reflects on the lives and work of other writers: W.H. Auden, T.S. Eliot, John Milton, Wallace Stevens, and others. He also reflects a bit on the Bhagavad Gita, a key Hindu scripture.<br />Ultimately, Price has an inclusive and hopeful faith: &quot;...I believe that God loves his creation....&quot;  His voice is earnest and his prose is beautifully written, but in the end I found the book oddly inert; I felt that I was left with no new insights into human suffering or the idea of deity. Still, a worthwhile book for both spiritual pilgrims and fans of well-written nonfiction prose.	2002-02-18

A blend of science fiction, satire, and war fiction, it is both fun and grim. The book tells the story of Billy Pilgrim, an optometrist, World War II veteran, and apparent UFO abductee who becomes \\"unstuck in time.\\" We accompany Billy back and forth from his wartime experiences to his encounters with aliens and to other events in his remarkable life.<br />\\"Slaughterhouse\\" is greatly enlivened by a colorful, richly imagined cast of supporting characters: American-turned-Nazi Howard W. Campbell, movie star Montana Wildhack, and more. But probably the most resonant of these amazing creations is Kilgore Trout, the underappreciated science fiction writer.<br />The book has an intriguing structure. Vonnegut's prose is a joy to experience: he combines a sort of Hemingwayesque simplicity with a knack for rendering startling, and often ridiculous, details. He is often very ironic and funny. Along the way, he explores ideas about free will and the nature of time. Much of the book is about writing itself.<br />In this book there is an intriguing reference to Stephen Crane's classic \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\"; perhaps this reference is Vonnegut's way of directly connecting with the tradition of American war fiction. But this book transcends that genre. \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is sad, surreal, whimsical, brutal, and oddly gentle. It's a remarkable book; I highly recommend it. As an interesting companion text, try \\"The Things They Carried,\\" Tim O'Brien's excellent book about the Vietnam War.	2002-02-05

According to the book's copyright page, the play was first performed in 1999 at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The play tells the story of Michael Majeski, a man who has attained celebrity status after an unusual journey: his business flight to Valparaiso, Indiana had become an unexpected odyssey that was both strange and ridiculous.<br />I read \\"Valparaiso\\" as a sometimes dark satire on television and the culture of instant celebrity. Majeski's story is also a reflection on individuality and free will (or the seeming lack thereof in the modern world). This is a surreal piece that is not, in my opinion, wholly effective, but nonetheless contains some sections with both real bite and pathos.	2002-02-04

This short book takes the form of an extended essay that is divided into several chapters. Dillard writes about the physical places in which she has actually written her work. Other topics include the relationship of the writer's vision to the actual fruits of her labor (\\"this changeling, this bastard\\"); the question of whether to write \\"one big book\\" or a series of short pieces; and a writer's relationship to the work of preceding writers. Along the way Dillard invokes the names of many other writers: Henry James, Octavio Paz, Helen Keller, Jack London, Emily Dickinson, Willa Cather, Ralph Ellison, Walt Whitman, Gertrude Stein, etc.<br />The final chapters deal with two people she has known: one a painter, one a stunt pilot; their crafts could be seen as metaphors for writing. I enjoyed \\"The Writing Life.\\" Although at times I found Dillard's prose a bit self-indulgent, overall I found the book to be a thoughtful and well-written meditation.	2002-02-04

But beyond that, this is a really depressing read. The story is basically a domestic tragedy set in the cold, grim town of Starkfield, Massachusetts. The title character is a poor farmer whose wife, Zeena, seems to be a hypochondriac. Their life together is complicated by Ethan's problematic attachment to Zeena's cousin, Mattie, who has come to live with them.<br />Wharton's prose is impressive on many levels. She really brings the reader into Ethan's tormented mind, and the effect is heartbreaking. Her representation of American vernacular speech is intriguing, as is her use of foreshadowing. Ethan--&quot;the most striking figure in Starkfield, though he was but the ruin of a man&quot;--is a memorable creation.<br />Ultimately, &quot;Ethan&quot; is a horrific vision of human coldness, cruelty, bitterness, hopeless, and longing. Despite Wharton's abundant talent, the book is a hard pill to swallow.	2002-02-03

The book is actually a collaboration between Laura and her daughter, writer Rose Wilder Lane; Rose's introduction and concluding chapter \\"sandwich\\" Laura's journal entries.<br />As the author of the \\"Little House\\" book series and as the subject of a long-running television series based on those books, Laura Ingalls Wilder is a truly beloved figure in American popular culture. \\"On the Way Home\\" offers an excellent opportunity to \\"hear\\" her speak directly from a real-life adventure. Her trek with her husband, Almanzo, and daughter Rose is a classic pioneer tale.<br />The book is well complemented by a wealth of black-and-white photographs of the family, as well as of the architecture, artifacts, landscapes, and animals that were part of their world. There is also a map of their route.<br />Laura's prose is very engaging. She writes of the natural landscape, plants, and animals they encountered along the way. She also gives a sense of the ethnic and religious diversity of that time and region. Her journal entries capture the excitement of the growing cities and towns.<br />This is a short book (120 pages), but it is full and fascinating. When Laura writes of such pleasures as wading in a warm river or picking wild blackberries, you can imagine yourself standing beside her. Recommended as a companion text: \\"O Pioneers!\\", by Willa Cather.	2002-02-03

The book is narrated by its main character, Johnny Rico, who enlists as a soldier in earth's Mobile Infantry. He and his fellow soldiers ultimately engage in combat with a lethal insectoid species.<br />The book is quite different from the motion picture of the same name, directed by Paul Verhoeven. I can not say that one is better than the other; rather, each succeeds in its own right as a compelling futuristic vision. The Hollywood-friendly love triangle of the movie does not occur in the book; the book, on the other hand, goes into much greater depth into depicting the stages of Johnny's education. The book uses these educational environments to more thoroughly flesh out the philosophical underpinnings of the future earth government.<br />\\"Starship Troopers\\" is thus more than an imaginative and action-packed sci-fi adventure; it's also a thought-provoking meditation on citizenship, military service, education, discipline and punishment, and the balance between rights and responsibilities. Heinlein's brutal future earth could be seen as either a utopia or a dystopia, depending on your viewpoint.<br />As a military veteran myself, I found Heinlein's depiction of the military subculture and indoctrination processes to be quite resonant. And Johnny is a very likeable narrator; I really enjoyed \\"accompanying\\" him on his personal odyssey. In my estimation, \\"Starship Troopers\\" is a classic of both science fiction and military themed fiction.	2002-02-03

Together, these pieces make up a book that is just about 70 pages long. But despite its brevity, &quot;The Shawl&quot; is a powerful work of fiction.<br />The book tells the story of Rosa Lublin, a Polish Jew and survivor of the Nazi Holocaust. Eventually she settles in Florida. This is a dark, haunting tale with some surreal satiric elements.<br />There are many fascinating touches to &quot;The Shawl.&quot; I was intrigued by Ozick's representation of immigrant &quot;English-as-a-second-language&quot; speech patterns. Also noteworthy is Ozick's look at the complexity of linguistic, class, and national identification within the Jewish community. Rosa's problematic relationship-by-mail with a professor of clinical social pathology is also noteworthy, and struck me as comparable to a certain motif in Toni Morrison's novel &quot;Beloved.&quot;<br />Rosa, who is bitter, angry, and psychologically broken, is a genuinely haunting and tragic figure. &quot;The Shawl&quot; is not light reading, but it is a memorable and rewarding book. Recommended as a companion text: Art Spiegelman's 2-volume &quot;Maus.&quot;	2002-01-20

Originally published in French in 1996, the text has been translated into English by Patrick Mensah. According to a note at the beginning of the book, a shorter, different version of the text was delivered orally at a colloquium at the Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, in 1992.<br />In the book, Derrida reflects on his past as an Algerian Jew living under French colonialism. He raises questions about language politics, personal identity, cultural domination, the notion of a &quot;mother tongue,&quot; and the idea of &quot;metalanguage.&quot; He reflects on the practical mechanics of French colonial administration in Algeria, and on Algeria's Jewish population: &quot;a disintegrated 'community,' cut up and cut off.&quot; He also discusses his own problematic relationship with the French language.<br />I found &quot;Monolingualism of the Other&quot; absolutely gripping. Although Derrida's prose (as translated by Mensah) sometimes strikes me as convoluted to the point of obscurity, I often found Derrida's style to be elegant, even poetic, and very accessible. But be warned: if you're intimidated by phrases like &quot;ontico-ontological re-mark,&quot; &quot;a pre-egological ipseity,&quot; or &quot;the hegemony of the homogeneous,&quot; the book may be a bit much to take.<br />But many will, I believe, tear into this challenging text with gusto. I believe that the issues raised by Derrida in this book are relevant to many other cultural phenomena: the debate over Black English, the political and literary recognition of creole and pidgin languages, the ongoing efforts to preserve the Celtic languages, etc. If you have a serious interest in these and related issues, I strongly recommend this book.	2002-01-09

Greenburg's lighthearted sci-fi tale is well enhanced by Jack E. Davis' goofy illustrations.<br />The books in this series tell the adventures of Zack, an elementary school student who often finds himself involved in paranormal phenomena. In &quot;Evil Queen Tut,&quot; Zack is accidentally shrunken down to insect size and encounters the villain of the title: she is the dictatorial monarch of a surprisingly advanced ant civilization. Zack is a likeable hero, and there are some clever jokes and plot points. Overall, this book is good silly fun.	2002-01-08

The story is told in the first person by Zack, a 10-year old who often becomes involved in paranormal phenomena. As Zack himself puts it in the book's opening paragraph, &quot;...weird stuff follows me around like a puppy.&quot;<br />In &quot;My Son,&quot; Zack encounters a strangely familiar 13-year old boy wearing a 2030 World Series sweatshirt. Well, as the title hints, this teen is none other than Zack's son Mack, who is time traveling from the future. The story revolves around the boys' curious friendship and their quest to return Mack to his proper time.<br />This is a lighthearted, highly entertaining take on a classic science fiction theme. Greenburg spices Mack's dialogue with some clever info about the future (including a taste of futuristic teen slang). Greenburg gets a lot of comic mileage out of the absurd notion of a 10-year old hanging out with a &quot;son&quot; who is older than him. But despite the absurdity, the relationship is nicely developed and quite appealing. And the story as a whole is greatly enhanced by Jack E. Davis' illustrations, which have a fun cartoonish energy. Overall, &quot;My Son&quot; is a high point in an enjoyable series.	2002-01-08

As the story unfolds, a diverse group of individuals converge on the reservoir of the book's title, where they face the fury of an Indian force led by a half-Yaqui, half-Apache bandit.<br />I have been aware of Louis L'Amour's position as a literary phenomenon for some time; according to the author bio at the end of this book, he wrote more than 100 books (his first full-length novel being published in 1953). &quot;Last Stand&quot; is the first L'Amour book I have read.<br />&quot;Last Stand&quot; is a solid adventure. L'Amour fills the narrative with intriguing details, and creates a powerful portrait of the land itself. I really got a sense of the danger posed both by the harsh environment and the equally harsh human beings who populate the region. One might say that the ancient, unforgiving desert is the most significant &quot;character&quot; in the book.<br />The characters include Logan Cates, an archetypal rugged hero (&quot;a man without illusions, without wealth, place or destination&quot;); Grant Kimbrough, a former Confederate colonel who has become a dissolute gambler; Jennifer Fair, the rebellious daughter of an important rancher; Timothy Sheehan, &quot;leather-hard and leather tough,&quot; an immigrant and veteran soldier; and others.<br />There is plenty of action and suspense. Yes, some of the dialogue is corny, and some of the plot is predictable. The story has the overall feel of a morality fable. All in all, a compelling tale of greed and adventure.	2002-01-06

It takes place in an elementary school classroom in the United States after the country has been conquered by some nameless foreign power. The story follows the initial re-education of the children by their new teacher.<br />This book reads very much like a product of the Cold War era, when many feared the possibility of ultimate Soviet domination. The story is written with a subtly chilling, &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;-like flavor; it reminded me of Ayn Rand's short book &quot;Anthem.&quot; Ultimately, Clavell's scenario plays out a little too neatly to be truly believable. But the story is undeniably thought-provoking. And even with the U.S./U.S.S.R. Cold War now a thing of the past, &quot;The Children's Story&quot; is still worth reading.	2002-01-05

Swim!&quot;, a children's book which combines a story by Jeannine Atkins with illustrations by Hector Viveros Lee. The book is about Jessenia, a young girl from the city who is on a swim team. Her mother, who reminisces about her own girlhood in Puerto Rico, is very supportive of Jessenia's athletic activity.<br />Unfortunately, there is a pronounced &quot;class warfare&quot; element to the book that I disliked. The girls compete against a suburban team. The suburban girls are never developed as real characters; they seem to be nameless symbols of class privelege. The urban girl characters complain about the unfairness of competing with these suburban girls who have better houses and a better pool.<br />Because there is no interaction between the two teams outside of the water, I found the story unsatisfying. Atkins certainly raises some relevant issues, but seems unwilling to deal with them at a more meaningful level.	2002-01-05

Amidst bouts of poverty, the two have a series of erotic and romantic encounters with a diverse procession of women: a runaway teen, a Danish widow, and other lusty, strange, and/or tragic characters.<br />Miller skillfully evokes the seedy side of Paris, with its prostitutes and cafes. His prose is clear and direct; he portrays the sex scenes with graphic confidence. The book as a whole has a loose, episodic feel.<br />I was intrigued by Miller's irreverent, rather ironic presentation of writers and writing in &quot;Quiet Days.&quot; Overall, I enjoyed this book: Miller writes with an earthy energy, and his story is punctuated by striking glimpses of human longing and frustration.<br />According to notes in the text, &quot;Quiet Days&quot; was written in New York City in 1940 and revised in Big Sur in 1956. The book would, I believe, make an interesting complement to some of the poetry of Charles Bukowski (I'm thinking specifically of his volumes &quot;What Matters Most Is How Well You Walk Through the Fire&quot; and &quot;Play the Piano Drunk Like a Percussion Instrument [...]&quot;).	2002-01-05

Peppe's decision to get a job as a lamplighter leads to conflict between Peppe and his father.<br />This is a good story that is greatly enhanced by Lewin's superb artwork. Most of the illustrations are two-page spreads that are packed full of energy and emotion. Lewin's realistic style is well-suited to capturing many colorful details: the sausages hanging in the butcher shop, a crowded street scene, the old-fashioned iron stove in Peppe's home, etc. Overall, a memorable celebration of Italian-American history.	2002-01-02

The book is divided into two sections: &quot;The Lords: Notes on Vision,&quot; and &quot;The New Creatures.&quot; This is one of those intriguing books that I by chance picked off the shelf in a bookstore and just began reading there in the aisle; I found Morrison's work so engrossing that within a few minutes I knew I had to buy the book and explore it more deeply.<br />The first division of the book is dominated by prose poems. This portion of the book is a combination of mystical/philosophical treatise and cultural criticism, often supplemented with historical references; here Morrison sounds like the love child of William Blake and Roland Barthes. The second part of the book consists largely of free verse and is more enigmatic; with its sometimes nightmarish imagery, &quot;The New Creatures&quot; strikes me as Morrison's own personal Book of Revelation.<br />An important theme in this book is the archetypal city: &quot;a ring of death / with sex at its center.&quot; Morrison also writes about the alchemist, the voyeur, and other figures. Much of the book deals with the motion picture as both art and cultural institution. Throughout the book are hallucinogenic swirls of cross-cultural references and allusions: Yoga, the assassin Oswald, hermaphroditism, the Christian trinity, Tarot cards, ventriloquism, lynching, etc.<br />In &quot;The Lords and the New Creatures,&quot; Morrison seems to be trying to attain a unified vision/theory that encompasses both modern technology and humanity's mythic heritage. His poetic language is often quite startling. This is a remarkable volume by an artist who is himself an iconic figure in 20th century pop culture.	2002-01-02

In a down-to-earth, vernacular free verse, Bukowski poetically explores a number of recurring themes: women and sex, gambling and games of chance, alcohol, cigarettes, his life as a poet, and other writers.<br />I see Bukowski as a sort of literary philosopher-satyr who often writes about the crude, seedy side of life. Some of my favorite poems from this collection are as follows: &quot;fire station,&quot; a bawdy, boozy narrative poem; &quot;a radio with guts,&quot; about the narrator's drunken abuse of the title item; and &quot;interviews,&quot; an ironic reflection on encounters with &quot;young men from the underground / newspapers and the small circulation / magazines.&quot;<br />In this book the reader will encounter junkies, drunks, and various colorful characters. Bukowski's tone is sometimes melancholy; often the bawdy life of his poems is haunted by the specter of death. And I was intrigued by his occasional literary references: to Dos Passos, Mailer, Rimbaud, Hemingway, and others. Overall, a compelling volume.	2002-01-01

First, the basic facts: this book consists of a series of interviews with Chomsky; these interviews were conducted in the first month after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In his comments, Chomsky offers a radically contrary view to the flag waving, &quot;I-support-the-President&quot; attitude that has seemed so pervasive throughout the U.S. Chomsky seems to be assuming the role of the angry prophet who points an accusing finger at a nation (the U.S.) and its leaders. Chomsky's interviewers in &quot;9-11&quot; include many different individuals and media outlets: Italy's &quot;Il Manifesto,&quot; the &quot;Hartford Courant,&quot; Greece's Alpha TV Station, and more.<br />Chomsky does not rationalize the 9-11 attacks, and in fact condemns them as &quot;horrifying atrocities.&quot; But he also claims that the United States' &quot;war against terrorism&quot; is essentially a hypocritical sham. Many times he makes the claim that &quot;the U.S. itself is a leading terrorist state.&quot; To support this contention he cites such history as the U.S. actions in Nicaragua under the Reagan administration. He also discusses at length the Clinton administration's bombing of a pharmaceutical plant in the Sudan. He criticizes the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan up to the time the book went to press, and discusses other connected issues.<br />The book includes many citations from mainstream media (&quot;The New York Times,&quot; the &quot;London Observer,&quot; the &quot;Christian Science Monitor,&quot; etc.), so one can't accuse Chomsky of just making his claims up. I would also note that David Rose, who is one of the many journalists cited by Chomsky, has a relevant piece in the Jan. 2002 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;; those interested in this book might want to also check out that article.<br />Much of what Chomsky says is compelling. But some of his claims and analogies strike me as flawed. For example, he claims that, in the wake of 9-11, the U.S. should have followed the response model demonstrated after the bombing of the Oklahoma City building. But Timothy McVeigh was not being sheltered by a regime at odds with the U.S., so the comparison hardly seems logical. And his accusation that the U.S. is engaging in an &quot;ongoing process of silent genocide&quot; in Afghanistan also strikes me as hard to defend.<br />The book is, in my opinion, greatly hurt by Chomsky's own tone. He seems to show little compassion for the victims of 9-11; actually, his words have a cold, arrogant flavor to them. Whether this is the fault of Chomsky or his editor, I do not know, but I imagine this tone will only alienate potential readers.<br />I applaud Chomsky for pointing out some relevant data from recent history, and for his willingness to raise a contrary voice in a time of crisis. But there is much in &quot;9-11&quot; that I must question. Despite the book's flaws, however, I recommend it to critical readers who want to better educate themselves on the issues surrounding 9-11.says is compelling.

The book combines autobiographical material with reflections on literature, film, music, and history. hooks declares, &quot;The denigration of love in black experience, across classes, has been the breeding ground for nihilism, for despair, for ongoing terroristic violence and predatory opportunism.&quot; Ultimately, she envisions a rekindling of &quot;the flame of liberation struggle rooted in a love ethic&quot; and reaffirms Martin Luther King's vsion of &quot;a beloved community.&quot;<br />In the book's introduction, hooks is clearly positioning herself in the great tradition of African-American literature and cultural activism: she makes reference to Lorraine Hansberry, Zora Neale Hurston, Ann Petry, Richard Wright, James Baldwin, June Jordan, and, of course, King. Later in the book she goes on to reference many other comparable figures: Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Paul Laurence Dunbar, etc. Among the topics she addresses are the following: images of African-Americans in the media, single mothers, black masculinity, the role of gay men and women in the black community, etc.<br />hooks' project is admirable, and her prose is engaging. Despite the book's strengths, however, I did not find it wholly satisfying. hooks has an annoying habit of citing her own books too much; I know she is a prolific author, but I find too much self-citation quite unappealing. Some of her critiques are questionable; I was particularly disturbed by her harsh assessments of Betty Shabazz and Coretta Scott King. And frankly, hooks cites so many different people and cultural phenomena that the book often feels rushed and shallow. Toni Morrison's &quot;Sula,&quot; rapper Lil' Kim, the film &quot;Soul Food,&quot; &quot;The Cosby Show,&quot; Oprah Winfrey, Spike Lee, W.E.B. Du Bois, Clarence Thomas: the names fly by at a dizzying rate.<br />Still, there is much to admire in &quot;Salvation.&quot; I was particularly impressed by her large-spirited celebration of black gay men and lesbians; she mentions such important figures as Audre Lorde and Joseph Beam, and offers an intriguing glimpse at the hidden history of black gay people. Many of her autobiographical passages also have the ring of power and honesty. Overall, &quot;Salvation&quot; is well worth reading, especially for those with an interest in African-American studies.there is much to admire in &quot;Salvation.&quot; I was particularly impressed by her large-spirited celebration of black gay men and lesbians; she mentions such important figures as Audre Lorde and Joseph Beam, and offers an intriguing glimpse at the hidden history of black gay people.

There are a lot of antics involving Snoopy and his pal Woodstock. But my favorite extended storyline in the book involves Charlie Brown's decision to quit school in order to devote himself to making Snoopy happy. Anyone who has ever been devoted to a pet should be able to relate to this funny but tender plot.<br />&quot;Peanuts&quot; has always been a successful blend of humor and gentle philosophy, and that is true of this volume. &quot;Make Way&quot; is a treat for fans of Schulz's work.	2001-12-29

In the book Quindlen reflects on books, reading, and readers.<br />Quindlen notes, &quot;While we pay lip service to the virtues of reading, the truth is that there is in our culture something that suspects those who read too much, whatever reading too much means, of being lazy, aimless dreamers [...].&quot; These, and many other insights in this book, really resonated with me. Throughout the book, Quindlen celebrates what she calls a &quot;lively subculture&quot; of truly serious readers.<br />Quindlen reflects on differences in men's and women's reading practices, on book groups, on skirmishes over &quot;The Canon&quot; of great books, on banned books, and on other topics. She tells how reading helped her keep her sanity during the &quot;year of disarray&quot; after the birth of her second child, and recalls how she fell in love with John Galsworthy's &quot;Forsyte Saga.&quot; Ultimately, she explains why she believes that new technologies will not make old-fashioned books (versus online books) obsolete.<br />HRCML is full of wonderful passages, such as a remembered epiphany over D.H. Lawrence. This short book concludes with a few reading lists: &quot;10 Nonfiction Books That Help Us Understand the World,&quot; &quot;The 10 Books I Would Save in a Fire (If I Could Save Only 10),&quot; etc. If you are a serious reader, I predict that, like me, you will recognize a kindred spirit in these pages, and will rejoice.	2001-12-27

In this volume we see Calvin's alter egos (daring interplanetary adventurer Spaceman Spiff, private eye Tracer Bullet), get a lesson in Calvinball (&quot;No sport is less organized than Calvinball!), witness the rampage of the Calvinosaurus, and attend meetings of the G.R.O.S.S. (Get Rid Of Slimy girlS) club.<br />Many of the storylines in this book have a strong science fiction element: in Calvin's imagination, his &quot;personal gravity polarity&quot; is reversed; he turns into a giant; etc. But the most fun comes when Calvin decides to clone himself. Much of the humor springs from the discontinuity between Calvin's rich fantasy world and the perspective of his often frustrated parents. Through it all, Hobbes remains a witty and philosophical pal to the mischievous Calvin.<br />C&amp;H is a comic strip that is both consistently funny and consistently intelligent. The art is great, especially in the fantasy sequences (check out the noirish milieu of Tracer Bullet, for example). Calvin himself is a nonconformist, a terror to authorities of all types, a dreamer and a schemer -- he's one of the all-time great comic strip characters, and &quot;Scientific Progress&quot; is a great showcase for him and Hobbes.	2001-12-26

The novel tells the story of Frederic Henry, an American who serves in the Italian army ambulance corps during World War I. He falls in love with Catherine Barkley, a British nurse, and has a number of traumatic experiences.<br />&quot;Farewell&quot; has a somber, haunting, and quietly compelling feel to it. In its ironic, naturalistic, and decidedly nonheroic presentation of war, the book seems like a fitting companion text to &quot;The Red Badge of Courage,&quot; another key American novel of war.<br />Many of Hemingway's characters in this book express a dissatisfaction with or alienation from traditional notions of religion, morality, and heroism. Their outlooks are often darkly cynical, as exemplified by this quote: &quot;The world [...] kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.&quot; In the midst of war, however, love between two individuals remains a powerful force.<br />There are a number of compelling secondary characters: Rinaldi, Henry's irreverent comrade; the young priest who champions &quot;traditional&quot; values; and more. As additional companion texts to this book, I would recommend Joseph Plumb Martin's memoir &quot;A Narrative of a Revolutionary Soldier&quot; and James Michener's Korean War novel &quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri.&quot;	2001-12-26

This book collects Larson's cartoons, but there's more: according to the foreword, the purpose of the book is &quot;to reveal some of the background, anecdotes, foibles, and 'behind-the-scenes' experiences related to this cartoon panel.&quot; Part of the book's fun is figuring out what parts of this &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; material are for real and what parts are just further jokes on Larson's part.<br />Material in the book includes Larson's childhood drawings; early, rough versions of some of his cartoons, along with the versions ultimately used; stories of the personal experiences behind certain panels; and more. One hilarious section records an editor's mistaken switch of a &quot;Far Side&quot; caption with a &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; caption (Dennis has never been more menacing). And there's much more.<br />And of course, there's a straightforward gallery of some of Larson's twisted cartoons. Among the sights the reader will encounter are dog hell; the Secret Chipmunk Burial Grounds; a screening of an amoeba porn flick; and an encounter with the sinister Professor DeArmond -- &quot;the epitome of evil amongst butterfly collectors!&quot;.<br />Larson's &quot;Far Side&quot; cartooons are a unique blend of satire, horror, science fiction, and surreal hilarity. If you're a fan, don't miss this collection.	2001-12-25

Re-reading it recently, I realized that the book has lost none of its impact. Holman tells the story of Aremis Slake, an undersized, persecuted 13-year old New York City boy. Overwhelmed by the stress of his life, Slake flees to the underground world of the subway system -- &quot;a city under the city&quot; where he finds a &quot;home&quot; and a new life. But a 13-year old can't live underground indefinitely; Slake is headed for a moment of truth.<br />This is a haunting, powerful story. Slake is a remarkable character. In many ways he's like a mythic hero; he literally journeys into the &quot;underworld&quot; and re-creates himself. Holman fills the book with fascinating details about the boy's survival strategies.<br />&quot;Slake's Limbo&quot; is rich in symbolic details, but the story can also be enjoyed at face value. This book is, in my opinion, one of the very best of young adult novels.	2001-12-23

This story (or short novel, if you prefer) is told in the form of letters between two characters: Max Eisenstein, an American Jew; and his friend Martin Schulse, a German who has returned home after having lived in the United States. The letters span the years 1932-34, and touch on the rise of Hitler and on the Shoah, or Holocaust.<br />The 2001 Washington Square Press edition of the book contains a fascinating foreword by Charles Douglas Taylor, the author's son; he discusses the story's publication history and offers some biographical data on the author.<br />I found this book to be an intriguing piece of fiction. The letters begin on a friendly note, but tension soon rises. There are also chillinging twists to the plot. Recommended reading, especially for those with an interest in fiction of the World War II and pre-war era.	2001-12-22

The strips generally form short stories within the book. The book's title refers to one of these storylines, in which Calvin creates a mutant snow man which in turn creates an army of similar creatures. Other storylines involve Calvin getting chicken pox; his creation of his own TV show; and his club known as GROSS (a warped acronym for &quot;Get Rid Of Slimy girlS&quot;).<br />The C&amp;H stories are great because they are funny celebrations of the power of a child's imagination. Calvin assumes such alternate identities as sci-fi hero Spaceman Spiff, caped superhero Stupendous Man, and private eye Tracer Bullet. Often the humor comes from the clash of Calvin's fantasies with the reality around him. The stuffed Hobbes, through the power of Calvin's imagination, becomes both a comrade and a great foil for the boy; their wacky relationship is one of the most memorable in the comic strip genre.<br />Calvin is an academic underachiever, rebel, performance artist, disgruntled philosopher, and all-around bringer of chaos -- although his playmate/rival Susie refers to him as &quot;the incurable weirdness poster child.&quot; Whether discovering a new dinosaur species (the &quot;Calvinosaurus&quot;) or evading the dreaded monster under the bed, Calvin is hilarious. And you've got to love a comic that cites the U.S. Bill of Rights. &quot;Attack&quot; is a great book both for C&amp;H fans and for newcomers to this excellent comic strip.	2001-12-22

Jenkins and Tim LaHaye, is #3 in the &quot;Left Behind: The Kids&quot; series of young adult novels. These books, which turn apocalyptic Christian Fundamentalist theology into fiction, follow the adventures of a quartet of teens following the mysterious disappearance of all Evangelical Christians from the earth. The books' heroes convert to Christianity and begin preparing for the &quot;end times&quot; scenario taught in Evangelical churches.<br />So far, these books have been marked by cardboard characters and melodramatic plots. Book 3 opens with some clumsy evangelistic material that reads like a tract. A major theme in this book is the characters' attempts to be on the lookout for the Antichrist, the evil figure whom they believe will become a world dictator.<br />Much of the book, however, revolves around a boring plot involving an African-American character who has become entangled in a criminal plot. Not only did this part of the book read like a parody of a bad TV crime movie, but I also found it offensive; it seemed to me like the authors were indulging in racist stereotypes of Black criminality. Overall, this book left a bad taste in my mouth.	2001-12-22

So I picked up &quot;What Matters Most Is How Well You Walk Through the Fire&quot; in a bookstore, opened up to a random poem, and started reading. Well, I was hooked from that moment.<br />&quot;What Matters&quot; is a posthumous volume of poetry by the prolific Bukowski, who died in 1994. According to the acknowledgments on the copyright page, these poems were written between 1970 and 1990 and were part of an archive which the poet left to be published after his death.<br />The poems in &quot;What Matters&quot; are written in free verse. Bukowski's vernacular language has an energy, charm, and down-to-earth accessibilty. His main themes are as follows: gambling at the racetrack, drinking, women, death and aging, other writers and artists, poetry itself, and his own public image as a hard-drinking dirty old man. He often writes about people or animals who might be seen as pathetic or seedy.<br />The book is full of intriguing literary references; he mentions Wallace Stevens, Pablo Neruda, Kafka, Rilke, Lorca, Oscar Wilde, Hemingway, Auden, Henry Miller, &quot;gutsy Ezra Pound,&quot; and many more writers. There are many narrative poems, often featuring &quot;Henry Chinaski,&quot; who appears to be Bukowski's alter ego.<br />&quot;What Matters&quot; is full of the cruder side of urban life: the reader will encounter pimps, gamblers, the &quot;dreary and doped / battalions&quot; of prostitutes, a &quot;flowing / tide of piss&quot; from a clogged Salt Lake City urinal, etc. There is often suffering. But through it all, Bukowski is often funny, philosophical, and even gentle. He can even find an epiphany in the act of shaving: &quot;&amp; I'm aware of ghosts &amp; spirits &amp; clouds / &amp; blood &amp; weeping &amp; skeletons &amp; / much more.&quot;<br />In the poem &quot;they arrived in time,&quot; Bukowski pays tribute to some of the writers who have moved him: he calls them &quot;those friends / deep in my blood.&quot; If you read &quot;What Matters,&quot; you might find Bukowski getting deep into your own blood.tribute to some of the writers who have moved him: he calls them &quot;those friends / deep in my blood.&quot; If you read &quot;What Matters,&quot; you might find Bukowski getting deep into your own blood.	2001-12-21

According to the book's copyright page, this collection contains material previously published in book form as &quot;You're You, Charlie Brown&quot; (1968) and &quot;You've Had It, Charlie Brown&quot; (1969).<br />Many classic &quot;Peanuts&quot; themes and motifs are here: Lucy's psychiatric advice stand, Linus' security blanket, Charlie Brown's unrequited love for the little red-haired girl, etc. Although there are a small number of dated cultural references, the strips have a fresh, timeless quality. The book also contains a noteworthy (and charming) &quot;Peanuts&quot; milestone: the first meeting of Linus and Franklin.<br />Although many of the strips are stand-alone pieces, many groups of strips constitute extended storylines. Some of these plots are as follows: Charlie Brown's attempts to discipline Snoopy; Snoopy's observance of &quot;Be Kind to Animals&quot; week; and in the most political storyline, Linus' involvement in a teachers' strike.<br />I must admit, reading this book made me laugh so hard that I had to wipe tears from my eyes. But in addition to being funny, this book is also philosophical at times. These &quot;Peanuts&quot; strips are still entertaining and relevant after all these decades.	2001-12-20

The book seems to be modeled on classic &quot;real world&quot; reference works like &quot;Jane's Fighting Ships.&quot; The &quot;Spotter&quot; contains profiles of starships seen in the fictional world of the various &quot;Star Trek&quot; TV series and motion pictures. Both Federation and alien ships, of all sizes and configurations, are included.<br />Each type of ship gets two 2-page spreads. The first is a technical overview with information on manning, propulsion, weapons, etc. The second 2-page spread is a full color illustration of a representative ship from that class. And therein lies the problem. Each illustration is actually spread over two pages. Thus, you can't fully and clearly see each ship unless you break the spine of the book in an attempt to flatten out the spread. This poorly conceived presentation greatly detracts from what could have been a great book.	2001-12-20

The book is illustrated by Jack E. Davis. In this story, contemporary schoolboy Zack is doing research for a school assignment. He is accidentally transported back in time to the year 999, where he discovers a conroversy surrounding the impending dawn of the year 1000. Zack's adventures involve both the students of the Dragon Slayers' Academy and an actual dragon.<br />This book is good silly fun, with some clever jokes and pop culture references. If you are looking for something that is actually eduactional about the year 999, look elswhere; the accent here is on comedy and fantasy. Davis' illustrations have a goofy charm and effectively compliment the text. Overall, a pretty good book.	2001-12-18

The book features illustrations by Lane Smith. The story is narrated by Joe, a young schoolboy. With the aid of a magic book, he and his pals Sam and Fred travel back to prehistoric times. They have an adventure involving primitive humans and dangerous prehistoric beasts.<br />This is a humorous story that is nicely complemented by Smith's surreal, funny drawings. The prehistoric characters are amusing and likeable, and the three &quot;modern&quot; heroes have an entertaining chemistry. Overall, a pretty good adventure.	2001-12-18

A new edition, edited by Patricia Romero and featuring an introduction by Willie Lee Rose, appeared in 1988. In that new intro Rose declared, &quot;There is nothing even vaguely resembling Susie King Taylor's small volume of random recollections in the entire literature of the Civil War, or in that of any other American conflict insofar as I am aware.&quot; Indeed, this book is a rare and valuable historical document.<br />Taylor was born a slave in 1848 on an island off the coast of Georgia. She gained her freedom and worked as a laundress for an African-American Union regiment during the war.<br />Taylor recalls how she learned to read and write and then herself became a teacher. She offers fascinating details about her life with the troops. She had many different duties beyond laundry service. I loved the episode where she recalls concocting &quot;a very delicious custard&quot; from turtle eggs and canned condensed milk, and serving it to the troops.<br />Taylor condemns the lack of appreciation shown for both black and white Civil War veterans. She also condemns early 20th century racism. Reading her book I was reminded of W.E.B. Du Bois' classic &quot;The Souls of Black Folk,&quot; which was first published around the same time; I think the two books complement each other well.<br />Taylor ends on a note of hope and pride, noting &quot;my people are striving&quot; for better lives. This book is, in my opinion, an important milestone in African-American literature.	2001-12-18

Hays Town&quot; combines text by Cyril E. Vetter with photographs by Philip Gould. Together, they celebrate the classic houses designed by Town. The book is full of superb photos of both interiors and exteriors. The book ends with a short essay by Andres Duany, in which he declares, &quot;The long, long career of A. Hays Town is like a bridge that brings forth the traditional architecture of Louisiana to the present generation of builders.&quot;<br />Many picturesque elements recur throughout the book: classical statuary, brick floors, exteriors with a look of natural weathering, 2-level exterior galleries, etc. Some particularly memorable images include the following: Hamilton House's interior courtyard overlooked by a second floor balcony; Westerman House's charming lily pond, made from an old sugar kettle; the rustic wood posts on the porch of the Bonnecaze House; the elegant white pillars of the Godchaux House; and more.<br />My only disappointment is that floor plans for the homes are not included; they would have, in my opinion, given readers a better sense of these houses. Still, if you love great American architecture, I recommend this book.	2001-12-18

It consists of a series of rhymes about small children who suffer various deaths. Each child has a name beginning with a different letter of the alphabet, and their grim fates are arranged alphabetically by name. Each fate is also accompanied by one of Gorey's macabre drawings. Sample lines: \\"E is for Ernest who choked on a peach. F is for Fanny sucked dry by a leech. G is for George smothered under a rug. H is for Hector done in by a thug.\\"<br />I found this book hilarious. Gorey's children have a proper Victorian look to them which makes their scenarios that much more bizarre. Most of the drawings show the unfortunate children just before their deaths; only a few of the pictures actually show explicit death or violence.<br />One could read \\"Gashlycrumb Tinies\\" as an outrageous parody of children's books (of alphabet primers in particular), or just enjoy it for what it is. Either way, I think it's a wicked delight.	2001-12-18

This book demonstrates a poetic style and subject matter that are very much like that of 19th century giant Walt Whitman; is fact, Whitman is even mentioned in one of the poems in this book (specifically, &quot;Interior&quot;).<br />Sandburg writes in a direct, vernacular language. He demonstrates an appreciation of the lands, people, and animals of the United States. He pays particular attention to working class life, industrialization, and ethnic diversity. A series of poems deal with American wars from the Revolutionary War to World War I. Throughout, Sandburg's voice is at times ironic, mystical, ecstatic, and/or tender.<br />There are a number of particularly memorable selections in &quot;Cornhuskers.&quot; I loved &quot;Wilderness,&quot; which begins &quot;There is a wolf in me.&quot; &quot;Prayers of Steel&quot; uses remarkable erotic language to explore the use of steel in America's development. Another impressive poem is &quot;Alix,&quot; about a champion racing mare.<br />Sandburg writes, &quot;I speak of new cities and new people.&quot; In &quot;Cornhuskers,&quot; he created one of the first great poetic testaments of the 20th century.	2001-12-15

But he and his family soon face the reality of war and &quot;ethnic cleansing.&quot; As the story unfolds, we see the struggle of Ervin's family to survive the violence and destruction, and their quest to flee to a safe haven.<br />There are many haunting and disturbing images in this book: a pack of abandoned dogs whose suffering has turned them into dangerous predators; the despairing faces of the victims of a &quot;rape camp&quot;; children playing on the ruin of a car; and more.<br />In a note near the end of the book, the author writes, &quot;This story is true. The characters are real.&quot; Kubert notes that most of the names are factual, and he merely took some storytelling liberties. The book includes actual photographs of the real Ervin, his family, and their surroundings.<br />&quot;Fax&quot; is comparable to &quot;Maus,&quot; Art Spegelman's powerful comic book tale of the Shoah.

Things get freaky when a classmate promises to sell him a &quot;secret recipe for freckle juice.&quot;<br />Blume taps effectively into the culture of children's folk magic and urban legend with this tale. I was a bit turned off, however, by Blume's portrayal of Andrew's shrewish, hysterical, overbearing mother. After finishing the book, I thought, &quot;When this kid grows up, he's going to have some serious issues with women!&quot; I also didn't like the fact that the &quot;villain&quot; of the story essentially lies, swindles, and violates classroom discipline and suffers no consequences. Still, &quot;Freckle Juice&quot; is a fun story with a memorable &quot;gross-out&quot; factor.	2001-12-15

Geared towards younger readers, this book recounts an adventure involving the Pokemon characters.<br />I have only a passing familiarity with the Pokemon phenomenon, and my impression of this book is that it is mainly geared to readers who already are conversant in the Pokemon mythos. I imagine that kids who aren't Pokemon fans will get 3 pages into this and go &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />The story begins with Ash and Pikachu at the beach on Seafoam Island. They meet Victor, a surfer who, together with his own Pokemon, plans to surf a legendary wave known as Humungadunga. But trouble arrives in the form of villainous Team Rocket.<br />The story is OK, but the illustrations seem to be merely random pictures of Pokemon characters; these illustrations seem to have no real relationship with the story.  If your beginning reader is a Pokemon fan, he/she might like the book; otherwise, I can't recommend it.	2001-12-15

The book's copyright date is 1973, and it was reissued as a Dell Young Yearling in 1982. I can distinctly remember reading the book aloud to my two younger sisters in the 1970s.<br />SQIGO tells the story of Jill, a young girl who arrives home from school to discover that Fletcher, her lovable bassett hound, is missing. She and her friend Gwen team up to solve this vexing mystery.<br />SQIGO is genuinely suspenseful, and also sensitive to Jill's anxiety. But mainly this book is a laugh riot. Levy writes witty dialogue, and Gerstein loads up his illustrations with hilarious sight gags. Fletcher himself is, to me, one of the most memorable visual characterizations in children's lit: with his stubby tail, droopy eyes, and big floppy ears, he is an endearing carictature of his breed.<br />Don't worry; SQIGO has a happy ending. This is a great book which deserves to be discovered by a new crop of readers.	2001-12-15

Through his characters Fleischman explores many important themes and events in American history: the abolitionist movement and the &quot;underground Railroad,&quot; the Civil War, women's suffrage, folk medicine, ethnic diversity, and more. Benjamin Franklin's writings emerge as oft-cited texts for Georgina's family.<br />I was particularly interested by Fleischman's depiction of the increasing religious and spiritual diversity of the U. S. in the late 19th century. Some of his characters are religious nonconformists, or are interested in spiritualism. Fleischman is, I believe, historically accurate here. The 19th century was a time of great religious nonconformity and experimentation in the U.S. To better appreciate this aspect of Fleischman's fictional family portrait, consider the poems of Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, the essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson, or the spread of new religious movements like Mormonism and Christian Science in the 19th century.<br />Fleischman writes in a starkly beautiful prose, and has populated Georgina's world with some truly wonderful characters. Georgina herself is a memorable creation. She is, in my opinion, a &quot;soul sister&quot; to many other great female characters in American literature: Zora Neale Hurston's Janie (from &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;), Willa Cather's Alexandra (from &quot;O Pioneers!&quot;), and many more. I highly recommend &quot;The Borning Room.&quot;	2001-12-14

Each cartoonist is represented by 1 to 6 examples of his/her work. The artists include Charles Addams, Lee Lorenz, Victoria Roberts, William Steig, and others; because of this diversity of artists, the book has a good variety of drawing styles.<br />Under the general topic of love, these cartoons cover such areas as sex, marriage, infidelity, jealousy, conflict, sexual politics, and miscommunication.<br />A few of my favorites: A woman at a bar tells a man, &quot;If you quote Rilke again, I'm just going to have to take my bra off&quot; (p. 26). Wife to husband, at home: &quot;You may be from Mars, but the children and I are still from Westchester&quot; (27). Categories in a Valentine's Day cards rack: &quot;SWM TO SF,&quot; &quot;GBF TO SWF,&quot; &quot;DWM TO SGF&quot; (61). And finally, a man, fully dressed with a coat and tie, and a woman, stark naked, sit in chairs at home facing away from each other. He says, &quot;Any plans for this evening, hon?&quot; (100).<br />The book gave me a few smiles and chuckles, but not much more than that. If you like some relatively tame humor about love, I recommend this book.	2001-12-14

The work of more than 40 cartoonists, from Ed Arno to Jack Ziegler, is represented; each contributor has from one to seven pieces in the book.<br />The book starts out with an interesting introduction by William Buckley. Yes, Buckley's opening line is a bit pretentious; he declares, &quot;Most people have an absolute all time favorite 'New Yorker' cartoon that they came across at some crucial moment in their lives [. . .].&quot; Actually, I think that &quot;most people&quot; don't even read &quot;New Yorker&quot;. Still, Buckley's contribution overall is witty and humorous.<br />The cartoons themselves are rich in ironic humor; they are often quite incisive, and occasionally contain touches of the grotesque, absurd, or macabre. Typical subject matter includes political doublespeak and spinmeistership; relationships between politicians and their constituents, their staff, and/or the media; the campaign trail; and more.<br />This book is full of memorable cartoons. Some of my favorites: an aide, helping a queasy campaigning politician, says to another individual, &quot;It was either the knish at Coney Island, the cannoli in Little Italy, or that divinity fudge in Westchester&quot; (p. 4); one campaign official says to another, &quot;On the other hand, if we backpedal too much, we'll lose the hate vote&quot; (p. 36); one cow, discussing a political race with another, complains of the candidates, &quot;They're both carnivores&quot; (p. 97).<br />Curiously, very few of these cartoons deal with real, specific political figures; often, they mock invented archetypal characters. I found the flavor of the book overall to be rather safe and middle-of-the road; I don't think there's much &quot;meat&quot; in here for political radicals of either a left or right orientation. Still, this is an entertaining, and often thought-provoking, look at an American institution.voking, look at an American institution.	2001-12-08

It's also a book that continues to be both entertaining and controversial (two qualities that not all &quot;classics&quot; have). I must admit: as much as I admire and am enriched by this novel, I also find its final chapters to be not wholly satisfying.<br />Twain is brilliant in that the heroes of this book, set in the pre-Civil War American South, are two of the most marginalized members of that society: Huck, a poor white boy whose single parent is an abusive alcoholic father; and Jim, an escaped African-American slave. Their relationship is beautifully written; Twain's vision of an interracial friendship is a significant milestone in U.S. literature, and is comparable to such relationships in Cooper's &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; and Melville's &quot;Moby Dick.&quot; Twain depicts Jim as a master of African-American folk traditions.<br />Twain evokes the vernacular speech of the American south; this literary technique has been continued by generations of U.S. writers, both black and white. Twain's merry riffs on Shakespeare are also worthy of note. I also continue to be fascinated by Twain's analysis of the twisted interrelationship among racism, institutional Christianity, and oppressive biblical interpretation.<br />In my opinion, the novel's weak link is the plot material revolving around Huck's pal Tom Sawyer. Tom is a wonderful character, but his antics seem out of place in the structure of the narrative, and ultimately cheapen the arc of the story. Despite its problematic aspects, however, &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is one of the truly indispensable classics of the American canon. It is a crucial junction in a literary tapestry that immediately encompasses such works as &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,&quot; Alice Walker's &quot;The Color Purple,&quot; and many other great books. If you haven't yet read Huck Finn, put aside any preconceptions you might have and discover the book for yourself; if you've already read it, read it again.t yet read Huck Finn, put aside any preconceptions you might have and discover the book for yourself; if you've already read it, read it again.	2001-12-08

Edgar tells the story of the Revolutionary War in South Carolina.<br />Edgar paints an interesting portrait of the people and culture of that region before and during the war. The book recounts the key battles and personalities that shaped the southern campaign. I was particularly fascinated by Edgar's analysis of the British failure &quot;to win the hearts and minds of the people of South Carolina.&quot; Edgar offers tantalizing glimpses at the roles played by women and African-Americans in the ongoing struggle. And the book is full of down-to-earth details, such as how uncooked meat caused illness among the revolutionary troops.<br />Edgar tells a good story. He writes in a clear, engaging style. The book is also packed full of useful supplemental elements: a chronology spanning 1756 to 1783; a glossary of terms, places, and battles; biographical sketches of significant figures; extensive endnotes with bibliographic references; maps; historic illustrations; and an index. This relatively short, but substantial book is an excellent choice for those with an interest in 18th century American history.	2001-12-08

That book, &quot;A Narrative of a Revolutionary Soldier,&quot; is an amazing document of a pivotal era in United States history.<br />Martin recalls his experiences in military campaigns from 1776 to 1783. He was an enlisted man who rose to the rank of sergeant, and his memoirs present the war from that perspective, rather than from the viewpoint of generals or political leaders. The suffering of the common troops is vividly detailed. Martin tells of the sleep deprivation, hostile weather conditions, combat death and injury, and lack of clothes. The men suffered from many diseases. But their most constant enemy was probably &quot;the monster Hunger.&quot; Martin describes at length the horrible foods the men had to eat: bread &quot;hard enough to break the teeth of a rat,&quot; carrion beef, and even tree bark.<br />From a tactical standpoint, Martin's descriptions of 18th century trench warfare are fascinating. Martin is eventually transferred to the Corps of Miners, and I was especially interested by the descriptions of his corps' duties: blasting rocks, dismantling enemy fortifications with axes, etc. He gives insights into how the miners' corps worked together with the infantry.<br />Martin's narrative is enlivened by his wit and humor. One of my favorite lines comes after he mentions the village of Maidenhead: &quot;don't stare, dear reader, I did not name it.&quot;<br />Martin ends his narrative with a passionate defense of the rights and dignity of veterans. He notes with anger that Revolutionary soldiers were &quot;turned adrift like old worn out horses&quot; after the war. He strikes me as very ahead-of-his time in his concern for veterans.<br />This book is a remarkable piece of early United States literature. It should be read by current military personnel, veterans' advocates, students of history, and students of U.S. literature.dents of U.S. literature.	2001-12-03

I was impressed by the motion picture remake of the old &quot;Lost in Space&quot; TV series: the sets, costumes, effects, and other elements were obviously conceived and designed with great care and professionalism. &quot;The Making of Lost in Space,&quot; by Pat Cadigan, is a documentary look at the making of the motion picture.<br />Cadigan discusses the process of transforming the elements of the familiar 60s TV series into a film. The book contains many fascinating concept drawings of the visual elements that eventually were used. Many &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; artists and technicians get some well-deserved recognition.<br />I don't know what the future holds for this sci-fi franchise. But this book is a treat for &quot;Lost in Space&quot; fans anyway.	2001-12-01

This book, which was published in 1995, covers all aspects of &quot;Trek&quot; history up until its publication date. Through text and plentiful illustrations, the book celebrates the visual artistry that has been such an essential component of the &quot;Trek&quot; phenomenon.<br />The book deals with each of the specific series from the original until &quot;Voyager,&quot; including both the often neglected animated series and the aborted &quot;Phase II&quot; series of the mid-1970s. All films from &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; to &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; are also covered.<br />The amount and quality of items in this visual &quot;museum&quot; are astounding. There are behind-the-scenes photos, concept drawings, photos of models, prosthetic makeup designs, storyboards, movie posters from around the world, closeup shots of props, and more. Particularly interesting were the shots of certain props and aliens which were barely seen in fleeting shots, but which represent great imagination and artistry.<br />Also noteworthy are the drawings which document the evolution of both the original series &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the &quot;Next Generation&quot; ship. I was fascinated by the concept drawings of possible &quot;Enterprises&quot; for the aborted &quot;Phase II&quot; series, as well as by the rejected new uniforms for the first &quot;Next Generation&quot; feature film.<br />The concise but clear text is a good match for the wealth of glorious, full-color photographs.

I recently re-read the book (more than a decade after having first read it!) and I continue to be impressed by its artistry and quiet compassion. In a series of poems, this book tells the story of an African-American family in the 20th century.<br />The book ends with a chronology that serves as a sort of &quot;skeleton&quot; for the story told in Dove's gentle free verse. Thomas and Beulah are an African-American couple who live in Akron, Ohio. They are ordinary people going through the daily trials and joys of life. From their lives Dove creates a low-key epic made up of intimate moments and flashes of insight. We accompany Thomas and Beulah through the World War II era; we see them raise a family; we see the evolution of African-American cultural identity. This is a rewarding book that, in my opinion, secures Dove's place as an essential 20th century American poet.	2001-12-01

The authors label this group the Millennials; according to the authors' model, the Millennials follow Generation X (born between 1961 and 1981), the Boomers (1943-60), the Silent Generation (1925-42), and others in a chain of definable generations that stretches back for centuries.<br />The authors look at some of the cultural forces that have shaped (and, increasingly, are being shaped by) the Millennials. They consider the increasing emphasis on multiculturalism; the impact of &quot;Kinderpolitics,&quot; or child-centered politics, on Millennial lives; the school uniform movement; Millennial pop-culture favorites like Harry Potter and Pokemon; the &quot;boy band&quot; surge; the impact of the Columbine massacre; and more.<br />Ultimately, the authors make some bold predictions. They claim that the Millennials will likely become the latest in a series of &quot;hero generations&quot; that occur every few generations (the last hero generation, according to the authors, was the G.I. Generation, born 1901-1924). They also predict a &quot;Millennial makeover&quot; of American popular culture in the first decade of the 21st century.<br />The book is fascinating and informative. But the authors' essential conceptual model and conclusions are problematic. It seems to me that the whole &quot;generational&quot; model is an artificial (and, at worst, stereotype-driven) way to break people into easily-labeled groups. In fact, I think things are a lot more complex than the authors seem to believe.<br />Still, the book is engrossing reading. It was actually recommended to me by a distinguished U.S. Army officer who suggested that the book could give military leaders insights into the wave of young people currently entering the armed services. I believe that many other professionals could also benefit from a critical reading of this book.<br />The book is full of fascinating sidebar quotes from many sources: periodicals (&quot;U.S. News and World Report,&quot; &quot;Spin,&quot; etc.); government officials and politicians (Donna Shalala, Bob Dole, etc.); film dialogue (&quot;Cruel Intentions,&quot; &quot;Rushmore,&quot; etc.); song lyrics (Christina Aguilera's &quot;Genie in a Bottle,&quot; Hanson's &quot;MMMBop,&quot; etc,); TV show dialogue (&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&quot; &quot;Malcolm in the Middle,&quot; etc.); cultural critics and commentators (Camille Paglia, Bill Maher, etc.); and other sources.<br />Throughout the book are funny and incisive cartoons by R.J. Matson. Charts and poll data also add to the book's appeal. Unfortunately, the lack of an index is a negative point. &quot;Millennials Rising&quot; is not without its problems, but it's definitely worth reading.reading of this book.<br />The book is full of fascinating sidebar quotes from many sources: periodicals (&quot;U.S. News and World Report,&quot; &quot;Spin,&quot; etc.); government officials and politicians (Donna Shalala, Bob Dole, etc.); film dialogue (&quot;Cruel Intentions,&quot; &quot;Rushmore,&quot; etc.); song lyrics (Christina Aguilera's &quot;Genie in a Bottle,&quot; Hanson's &quot;MMMBop,&quot; etc,); TV show dialogue (&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&quot; &quot;Malcolm in the Middle,&quot; etc.); cultural critics and commentators (Camille Paglia, Bill Maher, etc.); and other sources.<br />Throughout the book are funny and incisive cartoons by R.J.

The authors whose quotes accompany his photos include Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Marcus Aurelius, William Blake, Walt Whitman, Kahlil Gibran, and others.<br />In his photography, Reynolds has captured some great natural treasures: Capitol Peak in Palo Duro Canyon State Park, the Brazoria National Wildlife Refuge, Daingerfield State Park, and more. His photos are truly beautiful, and generally feature stunning interplay of light and color. Some of the most memorable images in the book include the surreal glow of light in cottonwood trees along Limpia Creek, a bronze-and-gold hued sunrise at South Padre Island, waters rushing over the rocks at McKinney Falls State Park, and much more.

A film version, retitled &quot;A Soldier's Story,&quot; was directed by Norman Jewison. This play takes place in 1944 (during World War II) at Fort Neal, Louisiana. Fuller takes us into an all-Black unit, commanded by a white officer, in the segregated army.<br />The play begins with the murder of one of its principal characters: Tech/Sergeant Vernon Waters, by an unknown killer. Waters' story is recreated in flashbacks; the play is essentially the story behind the investigation into the crime. The situation on the base, which is already hot with racial tension, intensifies when an African-American officer is assigned to the case.<br />Fuller has taken an explosive combination of elements and from them fashioned a truly gripping piece of dramatic art. Suspense, vivid dialogue, memorable characters, and penetrating insights all combine to make this a truly remarkable play. This is also one of those excellent plays which also succeeds as a text for readers.<br />This is a compelling look at the tensions and controversies surrounding the segregated army. Fuller is particularly effective at demonstrating the corrosive effects of racism on both Blacks and whites. Waters is one of the most powerfully tragic figures in all of American drama. I highly recommend &quot;A Soldier's Play&quot;; it is one of the great literary works about military life.	2001-11-26

Unfortunately, most of the book is very bland and generalized; it reads like it could have been written by some anonymous bureaucrat working in an obscure Vatican office. The essential subject matter covered in this book has been covered before and in more depth by many other authors.<br />The book is further marred by a number of questionable declarations. The author decries &quot;the massive presence in society of atheistic, agnostic, and even anti-Christian conceptions,&quot; but fails to give any concrete examples. And for that matter, I believe that many atheists and agnostics are very moral and tolerant people who should not be demonized in this way.<br />Unfortunately, that flavor of narrow-mindedness and intolerance surfaces in other parts of the book. The author asserts that &quot;Only Jesus has kind and consoling words&quot; and that there &quot;is no solution for skepticism and despair except in faith in Christ.&quot; I imagine many of my Jewish, Hindu, and Buddhist sisters and brothers, many of whom respect and appreciate the ministry of Jesus, would disagree with such restrictive statements. The author of this book needs to read more interfaith literature.<br />The author also naively asserts that &quot;Christianity is the religion of universal peace,&quot; and that all Christians become sisters and brothers. What then, I wonder, has been happening in Northern Ireland, where competing Christian groups have been slaughtering each other for centuries? I see it like this: Christianity is like any other religious or philosophical system; its precepts can be (and have been) used both to uplift and heal, or to justify the most horrific atrocities.<br />I have great respect for the great Christian prophets of the modern era: Thomas Merton, Martin Luther King Jr., John McNeill, and others.

Larson's work is a surreal blend of horror, science fiction, and satire, all filtered through Larson's twisted, often macabre, sense of humor.<br />Larson aims his pen at many targets in this collection; vampires, nuclear holocaust, the Bible, the tooth fairy, obesity, game shows, suicide, Vikings, vegetarianism, creationism, and much, much more. He often pokes fun at famous people or characters from literature and popular culture: Albert Einstein, Humpty Dumpty, Frankenstein, Carl Sagan, the Brady Bunch, etc.<br />One of Larson's trademarks is to feature non-human characters who talk and behave remarkably like humans. Many such characters appear in this book: worms, extraterrestrial creatures, sharks, slugs, elephants, dragons, flowers, roaches, and more.<br />The book is full of weirdness, but throughout it maintains an oddly consistent &quot;Larsonian&quot; logic.

The articles told how astronomer John Herschel, with the aid of an advanced new telescope, had discovered life on earth's moon. Of course, the articles were pure fiction, and the story has become known as the Moon Hoax. The articles, written by Richard Adams Locke, were published in book form under the title &quot;The Moon Hoax; Or, A Discovery That the Moon Has a Vast Population of Human Beings.&quot; A reproduction of an 1859 New York edition, with a new introduction by Ormond Seavey, was published by Gregg Press in 1975.<br />Locke's Moon Hoax is one of the most remarkable works of 19th century U.S. literature. Ormond Seavey's intro to the 1975 edition does a good job of placing the hoax in literary and cultural perspective. Seavey notes, for example, that the hoax appeared at &quot;a time when the tall tale was first recognized as a characteristically American narrative&quot; (p. xxiv). Seavey also makes note of the reaction of showman P.T. Barnum to the hoax, and draws a parallel between the Moon Hoax and Edgar Allan Poe's 1844 &quot;Balloon Hoax.&quot;<br />The text of the hoax itself is a charming piece of literature; it could be seen as a pioneering work of science fiction. The text's flavor of authenticity is enhanced by the many technical details about the new telescope; Locke even names the glassmaking firm that allegedly created the lens for the device! Locke's descriptions of Herschel's bogus discoveries are delightful. We learn about the lunar oceans; trees; gigantic, obelisk-like amethysts; unicorn-like creatures; tailless beaver-like humanoids; and most wonderfully, &quot;Vespertilio-homo,&quot; the winged human-like species alluded to in the book's title. &quot;The Moon Hoax&quot; is a marvelous book that deserves to be rediscovered by new generations of readers.	2001-11-25

Edited by Andrew Carroll and featuring an introduction by Douglas Brinkley, this book brings together a wide range of letters written by military personnel, nurses, family members, and others who have been part of the wars fought by the United States from the Civil War onward. The book is divided into several sections: &quot;The Civil War&quot;; &quot;World War I&quot;; &quot;World War II&quot;; &quot;The Korean War &amp; The Cold War&quot;; and &quot;The Vietnam War, The Persian Gulf War, Somalia, and Bosnia.&quot;<br />Editor Carroll has been quoted as calling these letters &quot;this nation's great undiscovered literature.&quot; In his foreword, Brinkley gives probably the best description of the content of these letters: &quot;impassioned evocations of love and sacrifice, duty and honor, fear and confusion, courage and perseverance, rage and the intimations of mortality that spark it.&quot; The letters are mostly by ordinary people, but the letters of some famous individuals are included. There are letters from both men and women, and from people of various ethnic backgrounds.<br />Enhancing the book is the presence of many historic photographs, as well as facsimiles of some of the letters. Probably the most extraordinary photograph is that of a letter pierced by a scorched bullet hole (the soldier, who was unharmed, was carrying the letter in his backpack when he got shot).<br />It is not really possible in a short review to cover all of the remarkable highlights of this anthology. But some letters that particularly struck me: the angry, frustrated rant of an anonymous Union soldier from the Civil War; a letter by an African-American soldier serving in the Union army during the Civil War; General John Pershing's letter praising African-American soldiers who served in World War I; a Red Cross nurse's touching letter of condolence to the mother of a soldier who died during wartime; an eyewitness account of the attack on Pearl Harbor; an amazing letter from Adolf Hitler's nephew, Patrick, to Franklin D. Roosevelt; a letter from a Japanese-American woman who was placed in an internment camp; and a letter from a real-life &quot;Rosie the Riveter.&quot;<br />The letters are accompanied by supplemental notes that put them in historical and personal perspective. This is a wonderful book that offers some very human perspectives on history.uring wartime; an eyewitness account of the attack on Pearl Harbor; an amazing letter from Adolf Hitler's nephew, Patrick, to Franklin D.

The story concerns Dr. Coppelius, a European dollmaker who is also an alchemist. Coppelius creates a remarkably lifelike doll who becomes involved in an unusual love triangle.<br />The paintings by Johnson and Fancher are an ideal complement to this story of love and magic. The photographic reproductions of the paintings are excellent; you can actually see the texture of the paint on the canvas. The art wonderfully captures a quaint European village; the artists include such details as half-timbering and ornamental stonework on the dollmaker's house.<br />According to a supplemental note, ballerina/author Fonteyn actually danced in the ballet version of this story; that fact gives the book an added touch if interest.	2001-11-24

Jenkins and Tim LaHaye, is the first in the authors' &quot;Left Behind: The Kids&quot; series of young adult novels. This book is rooted in fundamentalist Christian theology, and will probably read like a strange fantasy to those who don't share that particular belief system. This installment in the series follows a group of teenagers immediately before and after the mysterious disappearance of all Christians from the earth.<br />The main purpose of this books seems to be to scare impressionable young people into converting to religious fundamentalism. Throughout the book, characters worry about being damned to hell if they don't convert. One character is even threatened by her sister, who has already converted: &quot;'You'd better do it too, Vicki. Tou don't want to go to hell.'&quot; The book also spouts several popular fundamentalist mantras, such as the popular (and, according to my dictionary, false) claim that &quot;'Christianity is not a religion.'&quot;<br />&quot;The Vanishings&quot; contains a few interesting touches, but overall it's a rather bland book. The characters are cardboard stereotypes. Overall, the book reminded me of those absurd Jack Chick cartoon tracts that I have come across over the years. Still, the book is a pretty good expose of the fundamentalist mindset for those who are curious about this particular religious culture.	2001-11-24

Mooney, is #9 in this series of Powerpuff Girls stories. The book series is based on the popular TV show &quot;The Powerpuff Girls,&quot; created by Craig McCracken.<br />Just in case you don't know about the Girls, the book includes a transcription of the dialogue from the show's opening credits. The Girls are a trio of superheroes who also attend Pokey Oaks Kindergarten in the City of Townsville. In this book, the Girls investigate a supposedly haunted amusement park.<br />&quot;Frighty Night&quot; does a pretty good job of capturing the spirit of the show; most of the dialogue in the book actually reads like it could come from a television episode. The colorful illustrations look just like the visual style of the show. But overall, I thought the book couldn't fully reproduce the manic, zany energy of the series. I think that some characters are just harder to &quot;translate&quot; from one medium to another. Still, &quot;Frighty Night&quot; is good fun for Powerpuff fans.	2001-11-24

The book is beautifully put together.<br />The introduction explains how the great Christian mystics &quot;have often found themselves horribly persecuted as heretics by the established Churches.&quot; The quotes are grouped into thematic sections: &quot;The God of the Mystics,&quot; &quot;Communion,&quot; &quot;The Mystic Path,&quot; &quot;Humility,&quot; &quot;Mystical Prayer,&quot; and &quot;Love.&quot; A large number of mystics are quoted: Meister Eckhart, St. Catherine of Genoa, Julian of Norwich, St. Diadochus of Photiki, Maximus the Confessor, William Law, and many more.<br />My only complaint about this book is that the beautiful artwork is not labeled; since most of it looks like the work of historic masters, I found this ommission to be a shame.<br />The thoughts of the mystics are truly thought-provoking, no matter what your own religious orientation might be. I was struck by how many of these Christian mystics seemed to echo Buddhist and Taoist wisdom in their statements. Many of the mystics express a distrust of, or dissatisfaction with, conventional religion and learning; Marguerite Porete, for example, praises &quot;the sweet country of understanding nothing.&quot; This book's beauty and small size make it a perfect gift, and the intriguing quotes may just inspire readers to seek out more substantial books by or about these great mystics.	2001-11-24

In a foreword, author Karlene Kay Ryan explains that her 19-year old son was killed in a car accident in 1986; she describes this book as &quot;a simply written synopsis of wisdom born from experience.&quot;<br />I think that what she has written is applicable to various situations of grief. But several of the entries are specifically about dealing with the loss of a child, so if you get this book for someone dealing with another kind of grief, they might find these sections disorienting. Also, this book is very much geared towards a theistic audience (one's relationship with God is mentioned several times), so it is probably not appropriate for readers with a more secular orientation.<br />Overall, I found this to be a compassionate and gentle book with some good practical advice. She includes some practical exercises for the grieving parent. However, I should note that two of her exercises are not environmentally friendly (one suggests releasing helium balloons, and another suggests scattering ripped paper in the wind). Much of the book has a &quot;New Age-y&quot; feel, such as when she says &quot;You will be one with God and your child.&quot;<br />Overall, I respect Karlene Kay Ryan for taking her personal grief and using her experience as a way to help others. Whatever its flaws or limitations, &quot;To Find Hope&quot; is an admirable book which, I believe, has the potential to bring peace to many.	2001-11-24

The book is illustrated by Jill Pinkwater. The story is narrated by Norman Gnormal, a member of the Watson Elementary School Werewolf Club -- a sort of peer support group for kids who are werewolves.<br />This installment brings some interesting new elements into the series -- most notably, Honest Tom's Tibetan-American Lunchroom, were the 'wolves eat lunch. The kids face a naysayer in the form of a narrow-minded Board of Ed psychiatrist who claims that werewolves don't exist. They also discover a fiendish extraterrestrial plot. Good fun, with a nice message of empowerment for kids who are different.	2001-11-24

The story begins when a young Vietnamese-American girl starts a small vegetable garden in a plot of land in a neglected, garbage-filled lot. From this small start, a project begins which transforms the neighborhood.<br />This is a moving story which presents multi-cultural urban life in both its negative and positive aspects. Each chapter is told in the first person by a different member of the community. Thus, by the end of the book we have heard a great diversity of voices: male and female, of many age groups, and of many different ethnic backgrounds.<br />I was really impressed with this book, and recommend it to both younger readers and adults. For an interesting companion text to &quot;Seedfolks,&quot; try &quot;O Pioneers!&quot;, the classic novel by Willa Cather.	2001-11-24

Ulaq is intrigued by the shimmering lights that appear in the sky, so he asks the other Arctic animals what they are. Each animal--Wolf, Caribou, etc.--gives Ulaq a different answer that reflects the unique perspective of a particular species.<br />&quot;Ulaq&quot; is a fun book with excellent illustrations. The art has a surreal, glowing quality which captures the magnificence of the northern landscape. Each animal character is rendered with great charm. The curious Ulaq is a character to whom, I believe, many kids could relate! And an author's note at the end gives the scientific explanation behind the Northern Lights.	2001-11-24

Captain U is a spoofish superhero character not unlike the Tick or the Powerpuff Girls. Pilkey combines subversive humor with engaging cartoony illustrations.<br />Captain U's true identity is that of an elementary school principal. But after being hypnotized by unruly fourth graders George and Harold, he acquires his superhero persona. Captain Underpants is probably the silliest spoof superhero yet; he runs around wearing no more than his underpants (hence the name) and a cape. In this installment, the good captain faces a trio of devious extraterrestrial fiends.<br />Much like the popular TV show &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; this book mercilessly satirizes school and authority figures. Pilkey includes many clever touches, such as the incorporation of comic books allegedly written by George and Harold, as well as a &quot;Flip-o-Rama&quot; gimmick by which the reader can manually animate key action sequences. Overall, a lot of fun.	2001-11-24

The main characters in the story are George Tarrant, a no-nonsense admiral with a painful personal burden; Mike Forney, a tough and passionate Irish-American enlisted man; and Harry Brubaker, a husband and father who resents being recalled to military service as a pilot.<br />Michener creates an effective blend of action and personal drama. His narrative is full of interesting, vividly rendered details about life on an aircraft carrier.<br />Yes, some of the book's characters and situations seem a bit stereotypical; the female characters, in particular, struck me as one-dimensional. But overall this book is an impressive achievement. Michener creates a compelling portrait of men at war. This book deserves a continuing audience; I thank Michener for helping to keep the legacy of Korean War veterans alive with this novel.	2001-11-23

The boy, who is simply called &quot;Boy,&quot; volunteers to do the old man's share of work while the old man is on his quest.<br />&quot;One Small Blue Bead&quot; is a very moving story with striking illustrations. Himler makes effective use of warm earth tones. The book also contains an inspiring message about the interconnectedness of humanity across vast distances of both time and space. Truly a special book.	2001-11-23

The story is an entertaining blend of fantasy and humor, and is well enhanced by Jill Pinkwater's cartoony illustrations.<br />This book tells the story of Norman Gnormal, a boy whose parents have raised him as if he were a puppy. A kid who doesn't quite fit in with the average crowd, Norman finds a fairly supportive peer group in an after-school club for students who hapen to be werewolves. The club members go on a mission to help their faculty advisor, Mr. Talbot, with a dilemma invoving the magical relic of the book's title.<br />This book reminded me a little of the film &quot;The Little Vampire,&quot; but is sillier (and hairier). The text opens with a spoofy werewolf Q&amp;A, and incorporates some clever references to werewolf films and lore. Good fun!	2001-11-23

Jenkins and Tim LaHaye, is the second book in their &quot;Left Behind: The Kids&quot; series of young adult novels. These books are rooted in fundamentalist Christian theology. This novel takes place after an event known as the Rapture. According to the book, all true Christians mysteriously disappeared from the earth during this Rapture, and those people remaining on earth will eventually face an apocalyptic nighmare.<br />This sounds like the stuff of intense, sweaty-palmed drama, but this book is remarkably bland and boring. The characters are pretty much all shallow stereotypes, and the dialogue is dull. The melodramatic chapter titles (&quot;Ordeal at O'Hare,&quot; &quot;More Shocks,&quot; etc.) seem silly in light of the book's overall blandness.<br />The book seems to have two main purposes: (1) to scare impressionable teens into becoming religious fundamentalists, or (2) to reassure those readers who have already embraced fundamentalism. I know the book is part of a series, but its abrupt ending makes it unable to stand on its own apart from that series. Overall, a weak piece of literature.	2001-11-23

The only weak link in this book is the text by Roy Blount, Jr. Blount is trying to be funny. Sometimes he succeeds, but often I found his prose simply annoying or distracting from Shaff's outstanding work. But if you enjoy a limerick about dog vomit or a nasty insult directed at actor Steve Guttenberg, maybe you'll like Blount's contributions.<br />But if Blount is not your cup of tea, just ignore him and focus on Shaff's photographs. Her photographs really seem to capture the thoughts and emotions that run through a dog's mind. There are a wide variety of different types of photos: some tender, some funny, some bursting with energy. There are both action shots and shots of dogs at rest. Many different breeds are represented. I recognized such breeds as dalmatian, bassett hound, beagle, poodle, and others.<br />Shaff captures dogs, both singly and interacting with each other, in various settings: in the grass, in the snow, on the pavement, at home, etc. If you've ever loved a dog (and I have!), this book will certainly touch both your heart and your funnybone.	2001-11-23

It's a special book that can make me lose control and just laugh out loud. Such a book is the hilarious &quot;Captain Underpants and the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants,&quot; by Dav Pilkey. This book is actually the fourth in the ingenious Captain Underpants series (although the first that I have read).<br />The book is about two schoolboys, George Beard and Harold Hutchins. They have hypnotized their principal, Mr. Krupp, so that when he hears fingers snapping he becomes the ridiculous hero Captain Underpants (dressed in no more than his underpants and a cape).<br />Thus, Captain U is a superhero spoof in the tradition of the Tick and the Powerpuff Girls (and equally funny). This volume in the series has the underdressed Captain battling a mad scientist (the Poopypants of the title).<br />This book is full of outrageous humor and silly illustrations. The many clever jokes reward careful readers. A nice touch is the reproduction of crude, error-filled comic books purportedly written by George and Harold. Also fun is the &quot;Flip-o-Rama&quot; gimmick by which the reader can manually animate key action sequences. A wacky blend of comedy, science fiction, and superhero thrills, &quot;Captain Underpants and. . . Professor Poopypants&quot; is a blast from start to finish.	2001-11-23

His only companion is a burro.<br />When Alejandro plants a vegetable garden, his home is soon visited by small animals who drink from his irrigation furrows. Delighted by the appearance of these creatures, Alejandro conceives a project on a slightly larger scale.<br />The realistic illustrations of this book are full of life. The animals and plants, as well as Alejandro himself, are captured beautifully. Alejandro's gentleness, thoughtful nature, and hard-working spirit are wonderfully brought to life. The pictures and text together offer a good message about respect for nature.<br />The book ends with a short &quot;mini-encyclopedia&quot; that names and illustrates animals and plants of the southwestern United States: mesquite, saguaro cactus, the sage sparrow, the collared peccary, and more. An educational and heartwarming book.	2001-11-23

But when his village faces a food shortage, Eagle Boy's kinship with the winged predators becomes important for everybody.<br />&quot;Eagle Boy&quot; is a story of ostracism, love, magical transformation, and a mystical human-animal connection. Eagle Boy is a memorable hero. The illustrations are truly marvelous: they are rich with warm colors, and make dramatic use of light and shadow. The book opens with a stunning picture of eagles fishing by the seashore, and contains many other great images. Recommended.	2001-11-21

An author's note at the end states that Roberts was a self-taught photographer who documented African-American life in Columbia, South Carolina, and other places in the 1920s and 1930s.<br />This book is full of wonderful images: a proud graduate in cap and gown, a baseball team, uniformed schoolgirls, a couple posing with a classic car, a man with a dog, a young soldier in uniform, and much more. There are some particularly nice pictures of children that should appeal to contemporary kids. Together these pictures offer a moving glimpse into the lives of African-Americans in Roberts' time. Roberts had a real gift for photography, and the format of this book makes that gift accessible to young readers. Highly recommended.	2001-11-21

But his fortunes change when a mysterious visitor leaves the owner a magical gift.<br />Bang's illustrations appear to be photographs of multi-media collages, and have a wonderful 3-dimensional quality. There are lots of warm earth tones complemented by flashes of bright color. Here is another interesting (and, in my opinion, admirable) element of this book: the book jacket notes that the story is based on &quot;an ancient Japanese folktale,&quot; but Bangs features a multi-ethnic assortment of people in her illustrations. An entertaining, visually rich book.	2001-11-21

But he warms up to the piano at the house of his grandmother, Nana Hannah. He spends time with the tango-loving Nana while she recovers from a twisted ankle, and the two watch the World Series together.<br />This book is a really wonderful story of grandmother-grandson bonding. I have had very special relationships with both my wonderful grandmothers, so I could really relate to the story. Bluthenthal's illustrations have a fun, cartoony quality to them, and are bursting with bright colors, friendly energy, and nice details (such as the cats always lounging around Nana's house). Nana is a great character. Highly recommended.	2001-11-21

The text is the first-person narration of an Amish boy who tells about his life and the way his family celebrates Christmas.<br />The text captures many interesting details of Amish life. Particularly interesting is the presentation of the bilingual culture of this Amish community, whose members speak both Pennsylvania Dutch (which is actually a dialect of German) and English. Ammon includes a number of Pennsylvania Dutch words and phrases, with translations, in the text. Example: &quot;Siss am schneea&quot; (&quot;It's snowing&quot;).<br />Ammon's intelligent text is wonderfully complemented by Patrick's beautiful illustrations. Her style is realistic and colorful, and she superbly captures the facial expressions of the Amish children. There are many wonderful images and details: a horse's breath visible on a frosty December day, a colorful patterned quilt, a friendly snowball &quot;fight,&quot; and more.

Some Spanish words and phrases, with English translations, are blended into the text.<br />There are a couple of flaws with this book. The Spanish dialogue and English translations are incorporated into the book somewhat awkwardly. Also, the book fails to deal with important issues that are relevant to the plot, such as the possible danger of interacting with a strange stray. But the book has many good points. It teaches respect and compassion for animals, and Tonio is an admirable young hero. And anyone who has bonded with a cat (or other animal) can, I believe, relate to the story.	2001-11-21

Books	5	45	48	N	N	A hairy delight	Natasha Anastasia Tarpley's &quot;I Love My Hair!&quot; is a children's book that combines an easy-to-read text with colorful illustrations by E.B. Lewis. The text represents the first-person reflections of a little Black girl named Keyana. After describing the hair care ritual she goes through with her mother, Keyana reflects on the different styles in which she can wear her hair: cornrows, an Afro, a bun, etc.<br />The appealing illustrations blend fantasy and reality as Keyana thinks about each hairstyle. For example, her two ponytails become wings that allow her to fly. The text is also fun. Sample line: &quot;I love my hair because it is thick as a forest, soft as cotton candy. . .&quot; This is an especially empowering book for Black girls, but the imaginative elements in the book also make it good for a broader audience.	2001-11-20

It has an easy-to-read text, and is richly illustrated with many photographs.<br />This book tells about many of the games and toys of Native Americans, both in the past and present. Among the topics covered are &quot;jabber&quot; toys (used to challenge hand-eye coordination), snowsnake (a game that involves throwing a spear along a groove in snow or ice), and more. There are many fascinating photos, such as one of sled made from buffalo ribs.<br />The book covers lacrosse, which is probably the best known traditional American Indian sport. The author notes that some Native American peoples play a one-racket version, whereas some play a two-racket version (both types are shown in the photos). The book also discusses Native American participation in games and sports introduced by the Europeans. Overall, a very interesting book.	2001-11-19

Sammon, is an interesting look at the making of one of my favorite science fiction films of recent years. The book is packed full of visual elements: reproductions of conceptual art, behind-the-scenes photographs, and more. Some of the most interesting illustrations are sketches done by Paul Verhoeven, the film's director.<br />Together, the text and visuals describe the process by which Robert Heinlein's novel of the same name became a film. Integrated into the text are a wealth of quotes from both cast and crew members. Particularly intriguing are the explanations behind some of the differences between the novel and the film. There are some fascinating anecdotes, such as the funny story behind the filming of the notorious co-ed shower scene.<br />The book includes a lengthy interview with director Verhoeven in which he discusses such topics as the echoes of Leni Riefenstahl in the style of the film. If you're a fan of this film, you should get a lot out of this book.	2001-11-19

The story is superbly complemented by Susan Guevara's illustrations. The book opens with a Spanish-English glossary. The text is in English, with Spanish words from the glossary (&quot;comida,&quot; &quot;el barrio,&quot; etc.) blended in.<br />Chato is a cat -- described as a &quot;party animal since he was a kitten.&quot; But he's also a caring cat, and the story's plot is set into motion when Chato comes up with an idea to cheer up Novio Boy, a friend of his who is feeling sad.<br />&quot;Chato&quot; is really hilarious. In addition to the Spanish words, Soto spices up the dialogue by having the cats call each other &quot;dude&quot; and &quot;Homecat.&quot; The story involves a nice mix of silliness and warmth, and ultimately celebrates friendship. Guevara's outrageous, colorful pictures are full of energy and packed with surreal details. Definitely something out of the ordinary, and something special.	2001-11-18

They tell the story of Ricky, a young Latino boy. His teacher is planning to have the class put on a play about Cinco de Mayo, and Ricky will get to wear a costume mustache. But Ricky gets into a jam when he disobeys the teacher's instructions.<br />This is a fun book with an effective Latino flavor. Ricky is an engaging young hero. However, there is a weird gender identity subtext surrounding Ricky's feelings about the mustache; in my opinion, this aspect of the story is handled awkwardly. Otherwise this is a good choice for a multicultural collection of children's books.	2001-11-18

At about 1,000 richly illustrated pages long, this is one solid book. The bulk of the book consists of alphabetical entries on nations (from Angola to Yugoslavia) with warships and other national waterborne vessels.<br />The book also contains a color chart of the flags displayed on the ships of each nation, and charts showing the ranks and insignia of each nation's navy, coast guard, and/or maritime police force.<br />For each nation, the book gives information on the navy and other watergoing forces (key leadership, number of personnel, etc). The book covers the various types of vessels employed in each force, giving a wealth of data on each class of vessel: crew complement, weapons systems, dimensions, etc. There are many full-color photos and labeled drawings.<br />You'll find detailed data on all types of ships: icebreakers, tugs, small patrol craft, aircraft carriers, destroyers, survey ships, minesweepers, underway replenishment tankers, strategic missile submarines, barracks ships, amphibious assault ships, floating drydocks, salvage ships, hospital ships, and much, much, more. The book even includes the patrol boats used by the Swiss Navy on the lakes of that landlocked nation. There is also information on shipboard aircraft.<br />Along the way are many fascinating facts about the history and capabilities of various ships. &quot;JFS 00-01&quot; is a truly remarkable, visually stunning compilation of naval information.	2001-11-18

She lives with her mother, but spends time with her father. As the story unfolds, Martha's mom announces her plans to remarry a man who is not Martha's dad.<br />Simple text and bright, colorful illustrations enhance the book. Steele does a good job of dealing with a situation that I imagine many children face today.	2001-11-17

It is one of the greatest achievements of a truly extraordinary American writer. &quot;Red Badge&quot; tells the story of Henry Fleming, a young enlisted soldier in the United States Civil War.<br />&quot;Red Badge&quot; is a powerful story of war told from the viewpoint of a low-ranking enlisted man--a man who is really still just a boy. The book is rich in sensory details and poetic language; actually, the book is an effective complement to Crane's irony-laden, often grim poems.<br />Crane is as much interested in the inner mental states of Henry as he is in the blood and thunder of war. He does an effective job of portraying an altered state of consciousness brought on by combat. Also noteworthy is Crane's representation of American vernacular speech in the dialogue of his characters.<br />&quot;Red Badge&quot; is not a long book, but it is a rich text that invites re-reading on many levels. I recommend the following as companion texts: James Fenimore Cooper's &quot;The Last of the Mohicans,&quot; Tim O'Brien's &quot;The Things They Carried,&quot; and Eve Ensler's &quot;Necessary Targets.&quot;	2001-11-17

The poems are illustrated by Cheryl Gross.<br />The book contains four poems, each of which is preceded by a short essay explaining how Stewart came to write it. Each poem is drawn from Stewart's real life experiences. The poems are as follows: &quot;The Top Step in the Hotel in Junin,&quot; about a safety hazard at a hotel in Argentina; &quot;The Aberdares!&quot;, about an African mountain range; &quot;I'm a Movie Camera,&quot; about a camera he bought so that his daughters could film a family trip to Africa; and &quot;Beau,&quot; about a beloved dog.<br />The poems are not particularly deep or impressive from a literary standpoint, but they have a certain folksy charm. Some sample lines from &quot;The Aberdares!&quot;: &quot;The North Pole's rather chilly, / Those who've been there all will tell. / There's lots of snow and lots of ice / And lots of wind as well.&quot; &quot;Beau&quot; is sentimental and funny, and, I must admit, reminded me of a particular dog who was part of my family. At 32 pages long, this is not a very substantial volume. Recommended for fans of Stewart.	2001-11-17

The book has bright, colorful illustrations by Jacqueline Rogers.<br />Max is a little boy who lives in New York City with his dad, who is a fireman, and his mom, who is a nurse. When he expresses his discomfort with his baby-sitter, his parents find him a new one.<br />This could have been a pretty good children's book, but I was put off by one aspect of it. Max has a seemingly irrational fear of his first baby-sitter's cat. His new baby-sitter has a puppy and pets of four other species, but no cats. The parents never deal with Max's fear of the cat, and by the end of the book it seems like this bias against cats is reinforced. Approach with caution, especially if you are a cat lover.	2001-11-17

Together they tell the story of Sarah, a little Asian girl who takes shelter under a canopy of leaves when she is caught out in the rain. She is soon joined by various types of insects who also seek shelter.<br />This is a good choice for beginner readers, and reminds children that many insects are harmless and need not be feared.	2001-11-17

Together they tell the story of African-American enslavement and freedom.<br />Brown's paintings are truly stunning. He creates images that are often disturbing and graphic: men chained together like cargo in a slave ship's hold, a slave's back bloody with fresh welts, etc. But he also renders the faces of people with great care and tenderness.<br />At times, I felt that Lester's text was a bit too racially charged (for example, he includes separate &quot;Imagination Exercises&quot; for black and white readers). But on the whole, this is a moving and educational book. Also, there is text and an illustration explaining how many whites risked their lives to help escaped slaves; this aspect of the book is an effective celebration of racial reconciliation.	2001-11-17

In the book, Paine lays the philosophical groundwork for American independence.<br />Paine's writing style is still compelling after more than two centuries: he is fiery but logical, and bitingly witty. The book is full of great quotable passages.<br />In the book Paine sharply criticizes the institution of monarchy, especially the hereditary kind. He argues in favor of American independence from England, and proposes some principles for the government of such an independent state. He advocates &quot;the free exercise of religion&quot; and discusses in some detail issues of national defense.<br />It is remarkable how relevant Paine's comments remain, and how engaging his writing style is. His remarkable personality animates every page. The spirit of Thomas Paine is, in my opinion, at the core of what is best about the United States, and this book is part of the heritage of every U.S. citizen.	2001-11-17

The book opens with \\"A Cajun Glossary and Pronunciation Guide\\" for those readers who may be encountering terms like \\"fais do-do\\" and \\"gris-gris\\" for the first time.<br />The book tells the story of Ti-Boy and Baptiste, two rural Cajun brothers who are being visited by Remington, their cousin from the \\"big city.\\" At first, Remington has trouble fitting in with his country cousins. But ultimately, they find common ground and realize that Remington is, like the title indicates, as Cajun through and through as his cousins.<br />Thomassie evokes the vernacular speech of Cajun country throughout the book. Sample dialogue from the boys' mother: \\"Yo' cousin Remington's comin' from d'big city to visit fo' a spell.\\" The book is very funny; especially hilarious is Remington's reaction to a crawfish meal. The artwork is fun and colorful; Glass does a particularly effective job of rendering the boys' facial expressions throughout the twists and turns of the story. Highly recommended.	2001-11-17

Dunbar (1872-1906) was an expert at writing poems in both a formal &quot;literary&quot; English and in a style that evoked African-American vernacular speech (this second type of poem was known as a &quot;dialect&quot; poem). This book includes excellent examples of both modes. A sample from a &quot;dialect&quot; poem: &quot;Fiddlin' man jes' stop his fiddlin', / Lay his fiddle on de she'f.&quot;<br />I liked how several different visual artists contributed to this book; this gives the book a nice sense of variety. My favorite illustrations include Jerry Pinkney's pictures, which are vibrant with color and energy, and Carole Byard's delicate picture that accompanies &quot;The Sparrow.&quot;<br />These are poems about nature, African-American culture, and the joys of love and family life. This book is an excellent choice for a multicultural children's book collection.	2001-11-17

In this book, a mother tells various animals (a mosquito, a lizard, a monkey, etc.) to be quiet so that her baby can sleep.

The book tells the story of Prudence, a little girl who has gotten a new potty, and is learning how to use it.<br />The book is full of bright, friendly illustrations. There are explicit depictions of body parts, urine, and excrement: this enhances the educational value of the book, in my opinion. There are a number of nice touches, like the pretty flower pattern of the mom's dress.<br />Although I have only seen the &quot;girl&quot; version of the book, I understand there is also a &quot;boy&quot; version. &quot;Once Upon a Potty&quot; is a good book for families going through toilet training, but would also make a nice light-hearted gift for anybody.	2001-11-13

The plants covered include mangrove trees, banyan trees, baobab trees, saguaro cactus, mistletoe, and more.<br />My only problem with the book is the title. It seems a bit narrow-minded to arbitrarily designate some plants as &quot;strange.&quot; I'm sure lichen (which is depicted in the book) is not considered strange by someone who lives in a region with lots of lichen. That gripe aside, this is a worthwhile book.	2001-11-13

When a pale-skinned, apparently ill girl in a wheelchair joins her class, Dreenie is fascinated by her. The girl is nicknamed &quot;Bluish&quot; due to her bluish complexion. Dreenie begins a diary documenting her evolving relationship with Bluish.<br />&quot;Bluish&quot; is a gentle, moving novel about overcoming fear of someone who is different. The book is a hopeful celebration of childhood friendship. A nice touch is the fact that entries from Dreenie's journal are interspersed between the chapters of the novel. The book also offers an interesting perspective on the multicultural, multifaith world of NYC schoolkids; there's even a little primer on the celebration of Kwanzaa. Overall, an impressive effort from Hamilton.	2001-11-12

We learn how Hoang Anh was born in a refugee camp in Malaysia. We also see his multicultural classroom and learn other aspects of his life. An especially interesting part of the book is Hoang Anh's visit with Phuc Huu Tran, a Vietnamese scholar and refugee who acts as a cultural elder.<br />The book includes a couple of Vietnamese folktales, a map, and glossary.

At under 1,000 pages, it strikes a good balance between compactness and comprehensiveness. But on closer look, I found some faults.<br />The dictionary's good points are plainly visible. It has an easy-on-the eyes arrangement. There are many good illustrative photographs. There are brief biographical and geographical entries interspersed among the general entries.<br />Now for the drawbacks. First: Where are the cuss words? That might seem like an odd criticism, but slang and vulgar words ARE a part of the English language--a part which, furthermore, often turns up in works of literature. I see no justification for leaving out the notorious &quot;f-word&quot; and its colorful brethren.<br />The dictionary is also oddly inconsistent in noting that some &quot;acceptable&quot; words also have uses as vulgar slang. Yes, the compilers note that &quot;bitch&quot; has a rude meaning in addition to its proper definition. But they fail to provide similar data for many comparable terms.<br />I also noted another curious flaw: the definitions of certain words derived from people's names (Kafkaesque, Wagnerian, etc.) are not given at all. These words are just tacked on as undefined appendages to the brief biographical entries. So if someone tells you that their life is a Kafkaesque nightmare and you don't know what they mean, this dictionary will be useless to you.<br />I just recently purchased this dictionary, but my early inspection of the product has certainly left me with some doubts. Hopefully the next edition will correct these problems, and other flaws that my fellow users discover.	2001-11-12

Actually, it transcends the genre of fiction in general. Although labeled &quot;a work of fiction&quot; on the title page, the book really combines aspects of memoir, novel, and short story collection. I think you could use Audre Lorde's term &quot;biomythography&quot; to describe this book.<br />The first-person narrator of this book (named, like the author, Tim O'Brien) is a writer and combat veteran of the Vietnam War. The book actually deals with events before and after the war, in addition to depicting the war itself; the time span covers more than 30 years in the lives of O'Brien and his fellow soldiers.<br />&quot;The Things They Carried&quot; is an intensely &quot;writerly&quot; text. By that I mean that O'Brien and his characters often reflect directly on the activities of storytelling and writing. As a reader, I got the sense that I was being invited into the very process by which the book was created. This is an extraordinary technique, and O'Brien pulls it off brilliantly.<br />This being a war story, there are some truly disturbing, graphic, and violent scenes. But there are also scenes that are haunting, funny, surreal, or ironic. O'Brien depicts a memorable group of soldiers: the guilt-wracked Lieut. Cross; Kiowa, a Native American and devout, Bible-carrying Baptist; the sadistic but playful Azar; and more.<br />While this book is a complete and cohesive work of art, many of its component stories could stand alone as independent pieces of literature (in fact, I first encountered the title story in an anthology). But however you classify it, I consider &quot;The Things They Carried&quot; to be a profoundly moving masterpiece.	2001-11-11

A note at the beginning of the book explains that the author first heard a version of this tale from an exchange student from China.<br />The book tells the story of Hai Li Bu, a hunter whose village is facing a drought and food shortage. But things change for the better after a magical encounter. Ultimately. Hai Li Bu faces a serious ethical challenge.<br />&quot;The Hunter&quot; is a well told story featuring a compelling hero. Kids who were turned on to Chinese culture by the film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; will, I believe, really appreciate this book.<br />Ed Young's artwork is certainly striking: mainly shades of brown and black, with a splotchy quality. But I think the illustrations may be a bit too &quot;arty&quot; and impressionistic; I had the feeling that the art was meant to appeal more to adults than to kids. Still, I recommend &quot;the Hunter&quot; for those seeking to develop a multicultural library of children's books.	2001-11-11

In her introduction, Ensler notes that, in 1993, she traveled to the former Yugoslavia in order to interview female war refugees. This play evokes the lives of those displaced women.<br />The play deals with two American women: Melissa, a writer and trauma counselor, and J.S., a psychiatrist. They travel to Bosnia and hold group sessions with several women, of various ages, who have become refugees as a result of the wall. Their conversations are at times tense, funny, or painful.<br />&quot;Necessary Targets&quot; is a compelling depiction of a cross-cultural encounter. Throughout the play there was, in my mind, a question: Are Melissa and J.S. helping these women, or merely exploiting them to further their own agendas? Also interesting is Ensler's exploration of perceptions of the U.S. and Americans held by people from other nations.<br />In her introduction, Ensler notes, &quot;When we think of war, we think of it as something that happens to men in fields or jungles.&quot; Thus, this play is a valuable window into the female world of war.	2001-11-11

LeSieg with the energetic illustrations of B. Tobey. The text is told in the first-person by a boy with a vivid imagination. Sample text: &quot;I wish that I had duck feet. / And I can tell you why. / You can splash around in duck feet. / You don't have to keep them dry.&quot;<br />The narrator imagines himself having various animal body parts: the duck feet of the title, antlers, an elephant's nose, etc. The illustrations actually depict each fantastic leap of the boy's imagination. With each scenario, he imagines both the positive and negative aspects of the situation.<br />The copyright date on the book is 1965, so some aspects of it are out-of-date: there is no ethnic diversity in the all-white characters depicted, and the boy's father is shown smoking. But despite that, this book really holds up as a fun volume for younger readers.	2001-11-11

The year 2000 edition continues Debrett's long tradition. This book is basically an exhaustive compendium of data on the British royal family and on the titled noble families of the United Kingdom. The book is divided into three separately paginated sections: a collection of introductory materials, the &quot;Peerage&quot; section, and the &quot;Baronetage&quot; section. Altogether, the book weighs in at more than 3,000 pages.<br />As a reference work, DP&amp;B2K is fairly technical and might strike the average reader as a bit dry. But for specialists in genealogy, heraldry, and other fields, this book is an indispensible treasure chest of information. The bulk of the book consists of alphabetically organized entries on the noble houses of the UK. Drawings of the coats-of-arms of the noble houses are included.<br />DP&amp;B2K also contains the following: data on individual members of the royal family; a guide to the wearing of orders, decorations, and other items with non-uniform dress; entries on the orders of knighthood and chivalry, together with drawings of their regalia; and information on the living descendants of Queen Victoria.<br />If you love to know things like the fact that the Earl of St. Germans' coat-of-arms has an elephant's head on top, or that the Dukedom of Leeds became extinct in 1964, or that HRH the Duke of Edinburgh is a Freeman and Liveryman of Fishmongers' Company, than this book is for you.	2001-11-11

Like others by this author, the book combines simple text with illustrations in Barton's trademark style: bright, solid colors and simplified, almost iconic figures.<br />Barton depicts a rowboat, sailboat, fire department boat, ferry, cruise ship, and other vessels. The boats are actually shown in action. A nice touch is that the passengers and crew are people of different colors and ethnic appearances. Sample text: &quot;There goes a fishing boat out to sea.&quot; A colorful and educational book.	2001-11-11

In it the author/illustrator depicts a jet plane, seaplane, crop duster, helicopter, and other aviation phenomena. A sample of the easy-to-read text: &quot;This is a jet plane with people inside.&quot;<br />The illustrations are basically simplified line drawings enhanced with bright, solid colors. Barton brings a distinctive stylistic flair to this approach. A nice touch is that Barton depicts people of various colors and ethnic appearances. Overall, a good choice for small children.	2001-11-11

This being Potter's deliciously warped world, the mouse wears a green jacket and red bow tie.<br />&quot;Miss Moppet,&quot; first published in 1906, can be seen as the ancestor of Tom and Jerry, the Simpsons' Itchy and Scratchy, and every other predator-and-prey comedy carton. Potter creates wacky slapstick comedy out of her characters' antics. And if you own a cat, Miss Moppet's behavior just might ring true. All in all, a delightful classic by a giant of children's literature.	2001-11-10

Level 4)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Life at the zoo	I have always loved Jack Hanna's informative (and frequently hilarious) segments on &quot;Good Morning, America,&quot; so I was quite pleased to see his children's book, &quot;Jungle Jack Hanna's What Zookeepers Do.&quot; The book combines an easy-to-read text with excellent color photos of the keepers and animals at the Columbus Zoo. The photos are credited to Rick A. Prebeg.<br />The book gives the feeling that the keepers and animals together form a real community--a sort of multispecies extended family. The text emphasizes the bonds of trust that must develop between the keepers and the zoo residents.<br />There are some wonderful images in this book: keeper Maureen caring for a baby gorilla named Akanyi, a lioness getting her teeth cleaned, rhea eggs in the incubator, and more. If your child loves the zoo or is generally interested in animals, this book is a good choice.	2001-11-10

The rhymes are accompanied by Potter's whimsical, richly detailed illustrations of her animal characters. A typical rhyme: &quot;Gravy and potatoes / In a good brown pot-- / Put them in the oven, / and serve them hot!&quot;<br />In this book we meet such characters as old Mr. Pricklepin the hedgehog, and a dapper guinea pig. And in Potter's version, the old woman who lived in a shoe is a mouse. A fun, timeless book.	2001-11-10

'Somebody took it!' said Dr. Bear.&quot; The rhymes are accompanied by whimsical illustrations that depict such sights as a totem pole, a mummy case, and the &quot;Hall of Famous Bears.&quot; Parents and other adults should appreciate the gentle satiric touches. Another fine entry in a great series.	2001-11-10

The book is meant to educate children about the title subject, and combines a simple text with many full-color photos. However, I was disappointed in the book.<br />First of all, the book seems to be fuzzy on its definitions. A quote: &quot;Racism isn't just about skin color. It can also be disliking someone because he or she comes from a different country or has a different religion.&quot; The author seems to be folding racism, ethnocentrism, national chauvinism, and religious bigotry into one big ambiguous &quot;ism.&quot; I think many kids are intelligent enough to understand clearer and more comprehensive definitions.<br />The book gives many examples of racist abuse. And I noticed a disturbing trend: every example shows white kids mocking or abusing non-white kids. Thus, the book presents racism as something that only white people do. I find troubling the fact that non-white kids are constantly portrayed as victims--it seems imbalanced and unrealistic.<br />Actually, the book seems to be mainly oriented towards white suburban kids. Here is one unbelievable quote: &quot;Are you in a gang? Being in a gang can be fun.&quot; Huh?! I live in a largely African-American community, and believe me, that is a statement I would never make to one of the children of my neighborhood.<br />The book includes &quot;Notes for Parents and Teachers,&quot; a brief glossary, and a short bibliography. The author may have been well-intentioned, but this is one troubling book.	2001-11-10

The author discusses many different types of dolls. Each entry includes a short but informative article and a full-color, richly detailed photograph.<br />I won't mention all the dolls depicted, but here are some highlights: bread dolls from Ecuador, a 19th century corn husk doll from the United States, a 19th century French Jumeau doll with an elegant outfit and glass eyes, Russian Matryoshkas (nesting dolls), ornately clothed Thai Ramakien dolls, a Mexican nativity set, and much more.

BNW takes place on a future Earth where human beings are mass-produced and conditioned for lives in a rigid caste system. As the story progresses, we learn some of the disturbing secrets that lie underneath the bright, shiny facade of this highly-ordered world.<br />Huxley opens the book by allowing the reader to eavesdrop on a tour of the Fertilizing Room of the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, where the high-tech reproduction takes place. Into this seemingly advanced civilization is introduced John, a &quot;savage&quot; from a reservation where old human culture still survives. Thus, BNW is also a tale of &quot;culture shock&quot; and conflict.<br />Huxley creates a compelling blend of bizarre comedy, serious character study, futuristic extrapolation, and philosophical discussion. His writing style is crisp and witty, and cleverly incorporates references to canonical works of literature. Probably the scariest thing about BNW is the fact that, in many ways, humanity seems to be moving closer to Huxley's dystopian vision.	2001-11-09

This is a powerful and hauntingly beautiful book.<br />&quot;Wringer&quot; takes place in the rural town of Waymer, a community known for a yearly event: Pigeon Day, during which sharpshooters fire at pigeons as they are released from cages. Those unfortunate birds which fall to the ground wounded, but not killed, have their necks wrung by boys known as &quot;wringers.&quot; Traditionally, a Waymer boy becomes a wringer at age ten.<br />The novel follows the story of a Waymer boy named Palmer who does not want to become a wringer, but faces intense peer pressure to join in the tradition. &quot;Wringer&quot; is an intense study of social pressure, gender roles among children, bullying, and the rationalization of violence. The book also contains a memorable portrait of one very special human-animal &quot;friendship.&quot; Palmer is a compelling hero, and Spinelli's stark writing style has a lyrical beauty which reminded me of Ernest Hemingway. Particularly interesting is Spinelli's use of symbolism involving popular culture icons. This is a remarkable novel which I recommend highly to readers of all ages.	2001-11-06

At 56 pages, it is a concise but rich anthology. The book can basically be broken down into two sections: (1) traditional ethnic songs from various cultures, and (2) poems by contemporary Native American authors, again representing many cultures.<br />The traditional material includes the Seminole &quot;Song for Bringing a Child into the World,&quot; the Navajo &quot;Hymn of the Horse,&quot; the Pima &quot;Quail Song,&quot; and more. Contemporary authors included are Beth Brant (of the Mohawk people), Joy Harjo (Muscogee), Simon J. Ortiz (Acoma Pueblo), and others.<br />The book contains a useful bibliography. However, there is almost no biographical data on each contemporary author, and very little data on the various nations represented. The book would have been stronger if such data had been included. Still, this is a beautiful and enriching anthology. Topics covered include spirituality, animal and plant life, conflict with Eurocentric culture, Native language loss, and more. Some of the best poems include Joseph Bruchac's moving &quot;Geese Flying over a Prison Sweat Lodge&quot;; Maurice Kenny's sensuous, mystical &quot;Sky Woman&quot;; and Carter Revard's deeply spiritual &quot;What the Eagle Fan Says.&quot; I recommend this book both for classroom use and for general reading.	2001-11-02

This play was presented in New York in the 1950s, and in book form it is an excellent read.<br />I haven't looked at other editions, but the Signet edition contains two different versions of Act 3, along with a note by Williams explaining how director Elia Kazan persuaded him to write a second version. This feature makes the book particularly useful for teachers and students.<br />&quot;Cat&quot; takes place on a Southern plantation, and deals with a wealthy, but very dysfunctional family. Williams creates stunning dialogue for his characters: Brick, the bitter, alcoholic ex-athlete; Brick's frustrated wife Margaret; &quot;Big Daddy,&quot; the patriarch, who is dying of cancer; and the rest. Williams also establishes the plantation's original owners as a haunting presence through the lines of his characters.<br />&quot;Cat&quot; is an explosive family drama about greed, secrets, guilt, alcoholism, and sexual frustration. Williams' characters are larger-than-life, and even grotesque, but Williams never loses a grasp on their essential humanity. An important book for those with a serious interest in American drama.	2001-11-02

But over the course of time, the hostile environment of Pern caused the dolphin and human communities to gradually lose touch with each other. This book is the story of the attempts to rediscover and reestablish the ancient ties between the two species.<br />To the cynical, the concept of this book might seem like a &quot;gimmick&quot; to bring a new element to the Pern series. But believe me, &quot;Dolphins&quot; is no gimmick: this is one of the best in the entire series. McCaffrey creates a rich and moving portrait of the dolphin community -- a community with a compelling culture and history. This is also a beautiful &quot;coming of age&quot; story that focuses on Readis, a boy of Pern who has a remarkable bond to the dolphins. McCaffrey superbly weaves the dolphins' history and Readis' very personal story into the epic story of Pern's humans and dragons. I recommend this book to both Pern fans as well as to newcomers to the series.	2001-11-01

While some of the poems seem very dated -- due to their sentimentality and conventional structure -- the best of these poems remain rewarding and enjoyable.<br />The focus in this collection is on Longfellow's shorter poems. So his long poems &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; and &quot;Evangeline&quot; are not included, and not even excerpted. But the volume does contain many of his most memorable pieces: &quot;The Wreck of the Hesperus,&quot; &quot;The Village Blacksmith,&quot; etc.<br />The longest poem in the collection is &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish,&quot; a mini-epic of more than 30 pages. &quot;Courtship&quot; is a fascinating poem about the colonial era Puritans, and offers a fascinating perspective on gender relations, race, religion, and other aspects of Puritan culture. &quot;Courtship&quot; makes for an interesting companion text for both actual Puritan era writings (like Mary Rowlandson's captivity narrative) and later literary works about that era (like Arthur Miller's play &quot;The Crucible&quot;).<br />Another noteworthy poem is &quot;The Slave's Dream,&quot; a somewhat romantic, but sympathetic view of an enslaved African-American. Also included is &quot;Paul Revere's Ride,&quot; a wonderfully musical poem that, like &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish,&quot; looks back at American history. &quot;Paul Revere's Ride&quot; has a particularly impressive rhyme scheme to complement Longfellow's masterful use of meter. Yes, some of Longfellow's work may not seem very relevant to contemporary audiences. But &quot;Favorite Poems&quot; contains much that remains vital, and deserves a continuing readership both in and out of schools.	2001-11-01

The book is full of entries from &quot;Achilles&quot; to &quot;Zeus.&quot; It is an ambitiously multicultural work which includes the mythology of many regions: Africa, the Middle East, Australia, North America, the South Pacific, India, Japan, etc.<br />Each entry is a short, informative essay. Some entries, like &quot;African Mythology&quot; or &quot;Animism,&quot; are general in nature, while others focus on specific deities, heroes or relevant cultural phenomena. Some sample entry topics are &quot;Book of the Dead,&quot; &quot;Coyote,&quot; &quot;Dikithi&quot; (a Bantu trickster), &quot;Kali,&quot; &quot;Lilith,&quot; &quot;Quetzalcoatl,&quot; etc.<br />One of the book's strongest aspects is its rich assortment of full-color illustrations. There are many photographs of artwork of all types: a Hopi cloth, a sculpture of the serpent-headed Medusa, a stained-glass window depicting Sir Galahad, a knife handle carved to represent the trickster Raven, a wooden statue of the Chinese goddess Kuan Yin, Egyptian paintings, and much more.<br />A note to the reader declares, &quot;Myths are sacred tales about gods, goddesses, heroes, and heroines.&quot; Thus I was puzzled by the book's failure to include many important figures from Jewish, Christian, and Islamic sacred narrative. Yes, &quot;Adam&quot; and &quot;Eve&quot; are included, but there are no articles on &quot;Abraham,&quot; &quot;Moses,&quot; &quot;Jesus,&quot; &quot;Mary,&quot; and others. Yet the editors include figures from other living religions, like Hinduism. Certainly, by the book's own definition of myth, the excluded figures merit entries. This selective process of inclusion and exclusion left me somewhat dissatisfied with the book. Despite its flaws, however, this book is an admirable reference work for young readers.	2001-10-31

Taylor, is one of a series of works of fiction in which the author explores African-American history. Like her other books, &quot;The Gold Cadillac&quot; is told from the perspective of a young person and is suitable for younger readers.<br />The book's narrator, nicknamed 'lois, lives with her family in Toledo, Ohio, around 1950. Her father's purchase of an extravagant gold Cadillac causes some family friction. But the intense drama comes when the family piles into the car and takes a trip south, into communities poisoned by racial segregation and other manifestations of racism.<br />Taylor is frank, but not sensationalistic, in her portrayal of racism. And although the book ultimately celebrates the strength of a Black family, the book is not sentimental and does not, in my opinion, trivialize the scars of racism. And although Taylor is certainly a writer in the tradition of children's literature, I also see &quot;The Gold Cadillac&quot; and her other books as being a firm part of a larger African-American literary tradition. Certainly, this book has a good deal in common with such &quot;adult&quot; African-American literature as Gwendolyn Brooks' novel &quot;Maud Martha&quot; or Lorraine Hansberry's play &quot;A Raisin in the Sun.&quot; I recommend this book to readers of all ages.	2001-10-31

She is a recipient of the Newbery Medal, and this book, &quot;The Friendship,&quot; is a winner of the Coretta Scott King Award. Together with Taylor's other books, &quot;The Friendship&quot; explores some painful aspects of African-American history.<br />This story takes place in Mississippi in the 1930s, and is told by Cassie, a young Black child. The conflict in the story revolves around Mr. Tom Bee, an elderly Black man who refuses to observe the racist custom that requires African-Americans to address all white-skinned men as &quot;Mister.&quot;<br />&quot;The Friendship&quot; is a powerful story with great educational value. Taylor offers an unflinching look at life in the South before the civil rights movement. But be warned: this is a grim, violent story which, despite its title, carries very little hope of redemption or reconciliation. And a subplot involving one character is left dangling. Although all readers may not find the book wholly satisfying, I still recommend &quot;The Friendship&quot; as an important piece of fiction.	2001-10-31

While the collection as a whole is uneven, Pinero's unique vision and artistry are evident in the book's best moments.<br />Pinero mixes Black, Caucasian, Latino, and Jewish characters -- both straight and gay -- in a variety of situations. He deals with some pretty raw subject matter: drug use, violence, crime, anti-gay prejudice, prostitution, etc. His language is filled with racial and anti-gay slurs, as well as a lot of words you won't be hearing on network TV anytime soon. He sometimes mixes in Spanish dialogue (especially in the final play, &quot;Tap Dancing and Bruce Lee Kicks&quot;).<br />The best of this bunch is &quot;Paper Toilet,&quot; a hilarious satire about the sexual thrill seekers, criminals, and police officers that frequent a public toilet in the New York City subway. This play has some great comic moments, and throughout there is a delicious sense of absurdism. Another interesting selection is &quot;The Guntower,&quot; basically a 2-person drama that takes place on the guntower of an American prison.<br />On the whole, I felt that this collection lacks the power and depth of Pinero's great full-length play &quot;Short Eyes.&quot; But despite the unevenness of the book, there are some stunning moments, such as one character's graphic, painful account of being gang-raped. &quot;Outrageous&quot; is definitely worth a try, especially for those with an interest in Puerto Rican/Nuyorican writing.	2001-10-31

Martin Luther King, Jr. Thoreau was passionately opposed to slavery. He also cast a critical eye on the concept of majority rule, and was concerned about the place of a minority within an unjust system of laws. He has some noteworthy thoughts on the U.S. Constitution.<br />Thoreau is not just a &quot;theoretical&quot; radical; in the title essay he reflects on a night he spent in jail as a result of his civil disobedience (that event inspired the excellent play &quot;The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail,&quot; by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee). Thoreau's voice is still strong after all these years, and deserves to be heard by contemporary audiences. One final note: In his defense of the militant abolitionist John Brown, Thoreau describes Brown as &quot;the most American of us all.&quot; I think that such a description also fits Thoreau himself.	2001-10-30

In &quot;O Pioneers!&quot;, her classic novel first published in 1913, Willa Cather wrote, &quot;The history of every country begins in the heart of a man or a woman.&quot; By revealing to us the hearts of those pioneer immigrants in this book, Cather offers a moving meditation on United States culture and history.<br />&quot;O Pioneers!&quot; tells the story of a community in Nebraska farm country. Her main character, Alexandra Bergson, is a Swedish immigrant. Cather creates a marvelous portrait of the community and its rich mix of European ethnic groups: Norwegian, Swedish, French, etc. It is especially fascinating to see the multicultural, multiethnic world they created in the United States. Cather also depicts the cultural and linguistic &quot;shift&quot; that takes place along generational lines.<br />Cather's story deals with issues of economics, gender roles, and sexuality. In addition to the formidable Alexandra, she creates a cast of compelling characters. And her luminous prose style evokes all of the sensations of Alexandra's world: the smell of ripe wheat, the chirping of insects in the long grass, the golden play of light in an apple orchard.<br />But this is Alexandra's book. She is a great American heroine who reminds me of such beloved characters as Zora Neale Hurston's Janie (from &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;) or Alice Walker's Celie (from &quot;The Color Purple&quot;). Like those great characters, Alexandra will break your heart, deeply touch your soul, and ultimately leave you feeling richer for having known her.<br />Finally, as an interesting companion text to &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; try &quot;Anna Christie,&quot; the 1922 play by U.S. writer Eugene O'Neill. O'Neill's life and career were contemporary with Cather's, and &quot;Anna Christie,&quot; like &quot;O Pioneers!&quot;, deals with a Swedish immigrant woman in the United States.	2001-10-30

Struck deaf and blind by illness at the age of 19 months, she still managed to get an education and become a writer and activist. Her story was further popularized by William Gibson's play &quot;The Miracle Worker,&quot; which was also adapted for both film and television.<br />Keller's autobiography, &quot;The Story of My Life,&quot; first appeared in installments in &quot;Ladies' Home Journal&quot; in 1902. This book is truly one of the great American autobiographies: an inspiring story of a courageous individual who overcame tremendous odds.<br />Keller writes about many things: her childhood in Alabama; her relationship with her beloved teacher, Anne Sullivan; her attendance at the Wright-Humason School for the Deaf in New York City; and meeting such eminent figures as Mark Twain. She especially stresses her love of literature, which she describes as &quot;my Utopia.&quot;<br />Along the way are some fascinating details and profoundly moving passages. Her tribute to the Homer, the blind poet of ancient Greece, is particularly powerful. I also loved her interpretation of the biblical Book of Ruth: a story of &quot;love which can rise above conflicting creeds and deep-seated racial prejudices.&quot;<br />I think that many will regard Keller's autobiography as a mere historical or sociological document. But I think the book deserves a place as a great work of literature, and moreover as a work of literature in the great American tradition. Keller's poetic, often sensuous words about the natural world are comparable to the work of Emily Dickinson. And her stirring account of her revelatory awareness of language reminds me of Frederick Douglass' account of his first awareness of the power of literacy. The book as a whole is enhanced by Keller's charming, likeable literary style.<br />&quot;The Story of My Life&quot; is a wonderful book by an amazing individual. Helen Keller still has, I believe, much to say to contemporary audiences., much to say to contemporary audiences.	2001-10-28

It appeared on Broadway during the 1959-60 dramatic season, was made into a motion picture a couple of years later, and then was remade as a television movie for the 1979-80 season. The play's genesis lies in the real story of Helen Keller (1880-1968), the woman who was struck deaf and blind by illness at the age of 19 months. &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; tells how a young Helen was led out of her prison of silence and darkness by the remarkable Anne Sullivan, who set out to teach the girl sign language.<br />&quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; is a truly great play. Gibson brilliantly takes the historical facts of Keller's childhood (many of which can be found in &quot;The Story of My Life,&quot; Keller's 1902 autobiography) and turns them into a suspenseful, profoundly moving piece of theater. Although the core of the play is the fiery relationship between Sullivan and the wildly undisciplined Helen, Gibson's drama takes in the entire Keller household. I was particularly moved by the relationship between &quot;Miss Annie&quot; and Helen's frustrated but devoted mother.<br />&quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; is remarkable because much of the story is told not in dialogue, but in Gibson's stage directions. This is one of those plays which is not only powerful in performance, but also a gripping read.<br />Gibson's play is one of those great examples of a drama that takes real American life stories and turns them into enduring art; in that sense, it is comparable to such great works as &quot;The Crucible,&quot; by Arthur Miller, or &quot;The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail,&quot; by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee.<br />&quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; is not only a compelling human drama, but also a reflection on courage, love, education, and the transcendent power of language. As an interesting complementary text, I recommend Octavia Butler's science fiction story &quot;Speech Sounds&quot; (which can be found in Butler's book &quot;Bloodchild and Other Stories&quot;).n story &quot;Speech Sounds&quot; (which can be found in Butler's book &quot;Bloodchild and Other Stories&quot;).	2001-10-28

It was a milestone in the too-short life of Dunbar (1872-1906), a pioneering figure in African-American literature. In his introduction to &quot;Lyrics,&quot; William Dean Howells notes that Dunbar portrays African-Americans &quot;with humor, with sympathy, and yet with what the reader must instinctively feel to be entire truthfulness.&quot;<br />Dunbar's poetry generally falls into two groups: those written in a &quot;high&quot; literary English, and those which reproduce American vernacular speech (the &quot;dialect pieces,&quot; as Howells calls them). Dunbar's gift is that he excels in both modes. He is adept at using a number of different meter and rhyme schemes; the best of his poems achieve a musicality and technical proficiency that compare favorably with the poetry of Edgar Allan Poe.<br />Yes, some of his poems seem quite dated today. They are often excessively sentimental and sometimes tediously conventional. But &quot;Lyrics&quot; is also full of some really outstanding, thought-provoking pieces. Consider &quot;Frederick Douglass,&quot; a stirring tribute to the great African-American writer and activist; Dunbar follows 9 stanzas of iambic pentameter in an ABABCC rhyme scheme with a concluding ABABCCDD stanza. (Indeed, I find half the fun of reading Dunbar to be analyzing his diverse poetic structures.)<br />In poems like &quot;Song&quot; and &quot;Ode to Ethiopia,&quot; Dunbar shows a pride in the African-American people. And although some poems seem to present a romantic, sentimental view of slavery, consider the brilliant &quot;An Ante-Bellum Sermon&quot;: this &quot;dialect&quot; poem satirically demonstrates how Black slave preachers managed to subvert the racist biblical interpretations of the slavemasters.<br />Other outstanding selections include &quot;Religion,&quot; which envisions a humanistic faith; &quot;The Spellin'-Bee,&quot; a longer narrative poem of small-town life; &quot;The Colored Soldiers,&quot; a tribute to the &quot;gallant colored soldiers / Who fought for Uncle Sam,&quot; and &quot;When de Co'n Pone's Hot,&quot; a celebration of traditional soul food.<br />Dunbar's poetry can be seen as a forerunner for the work of such American poets as Langston Hughes and Gwendolyn Brooks. And for a fascinating complement to Dunbar's poetry, read the poetry of his American contemporary, Stephen Crane (1871-1900); &quot;The Complete Poems of Stephen Crane&quot; have been edited by Joseph Katz. To sum up, Dunbar is a poet whose life overlapped the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but I believe that he has something to say for contemporary readers and scholars.small-town life; &quot;The Colored Soldiers,&quot; a tribute to the &quot;gallant colored soldiers / Who fought for Uncle Sam,&quot; and &quot;When de Co'n Pone's Hot,&quot; a celebration of traditional soul food.<br />Dunbar's poetry can be seen as a forerunner for the work of such American poets as Langston Hughes and Gwendolyn Brooks.

DuBois, is a book that still shines with power and relevance. A collection of essays and narrative pieces on the African-American experience, &quot;Souls&quot; is a brilliant blend of history, political science, and memoir, all written in a compelling literary style.<br />DuBois is intensely concerned with the situation of African-Americans, but &quot;Souls&quot; also shows flashes of the global vision that would develop throughout his intellectual career. In this book he introduces such key concepts as &quot;the Veil&quot; and &quot;double-consciousness&quot;; although these terms are explored within the African-American context, I believe they are relevant with regard to other groups that are marginalized on the basis of difference.<br />DuBois incisively criticizes the racism that plagued America after the end of slavery. Particularly fascinating is his iconoclastic critique of controversial Black leader Booker T. Washington, whom DuBois saw as too willing to compromise with a white racist establishment. There is a strong concern with economic issues in &quot;Souls&quot;; DuBois condemns a heartless capitalism which turns human beings into mere commodities, and considers how the &quot;slavery of debt&quot; replaced literal slavery for many Blacks. One of the best sections of the book is his apparently autobiographical account of teaching in a rural Black school in Tennessee.<br />Dubois' literary style is worthy of note: elegant and learned, direct and passionate. He makes many classical and literary references. DuBois' ideas make him, in my opinion, a figure who links the radical United States essayists of the 19th century (David Walker, Henry David Thoreau, etc.) with those of the mid- and late 20th century (James Baldwin, Thomas Merton, Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde, etc.). &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; is an essential classic, and a great read.	2001-10-26

Falwell praises or quotes other right wing figures like Phyllis Schlafly and Jesse Helms. He reviews American history through a distorted, one-sided lens; in his efforts to depict the United States as a Christian nation, he fails to acknowledge the full theological and philosophical diversity of the nation's founders. He insists on a simplistically literalistic reading of biblical passages.<br />Falwell found himself the object of much scorn after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 -- attacks which brought devastation to New York City and Washington, DC. After that horrible tragedy, Falwell publicly blamed pagans, feminists, civil libertarians, gay activists, and others for allegedly bringing divine wrath on the U.S., and thus helping cause the attack. This cruel and insensitive rant outraged an already hurting nation, and greatly discredited Falwell. But his comments should not really have surprised anybody; he had made similar intolerant statements 20 years earlier in &quot;Listen, America!&quot;<br />Throughout his career, Falwell has tried to present himself as a sort of modern-day prophet. But &quot;Listen, America&quot; reveals him to be someone who is totally out of step with the true Christian prophets of the 20th century: individuals such as Thomas Merton, John McNeill, and Martin Luther King, Jr. While interesting as a historical document, &quot;Listen, America!&quot; is an ugly, mean-spirited book.pirited book.	2001-10-26

At over 500 pages long, &quot;Blacks&quot; is a truly monumental text. Included are several books in their entirety (&quot;Annie Allen,&quot; &quot;In the Mecca,&quot; etc.) as well as excerpts from some later books (&quot;Primer for Blacks,&quot; &quot;The Near-Johannesburg Boy and Other Poems,&quot; etc.). Although most of the books represented are works of poetry, &quot;Blacks&quot; also contains the text of Brooks' 1953 novel &quot;Maud Martha.&quot;<br />Brooks is a stylistic virtuoso, proficient with the sonnet, ballad, free verse, and other forms. She is an expert with alliteration, rhyme, and other musical effects. Her vocabulary is encyclopedic; she evokes not only African-American vernacular speech, but also the entire sweeping history of the literary tradition in English. In this collection are both short poems and longer poems.<br />Many of Brooks' poems deal with aspects of African-American life. She writes of anti-Black violence and other forms of racism, and reflects upon enduring figures in African-American cultural history. She also writes of family relationships and intimate personal crises.<br />Her novel, &quot;Maud Martha,&quot; is a poetic chronicle of the life of a dark-skinned urban Black girl. We follow Maud Martha through her girlhood, marriage, and motherhood. &quot;Maud Martha&quot; is a memorable vision of an African-American woman's life, and, in my opinion, should stand beside such literary works as Harriet Jacobs' &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,&quot; Zora Neale Hurston's &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God,&quot; and Audre Lorde's &quot;Zami.&quot;<br />Of Brooks' long poems, I found the most memorable to be &quot;In the Mecca,&quot; a tragic and haunting narrative poem that takes place in a Chicago apartment building. &quot;In the Mecca&quot; is a sort of urban, African-American &quot;Odyssey&quot; in which we encounter the various inhabitants of this world.<br />In her poetic tribute to Langston Hughes, Brooks writes that he has &quot;a long reach, / strong speech.&quot; I would say the same of Brooks.

This volume is an unabridged republication of the contents of two of her books: the 1922 edition of &quot;A Few Figs from Thistles: Poems and Sonnets,&quot; and &quot;Second April&quot; (1921). The book also contains a 5-page biographical introduction.<br />These poems reveal a remarkable poetic voice: playful, bold, quirky, passionate, and sometimes melancholy. She often writes of romantic love from a woman's perspective. I read Millay (as exemplified by this book) as a sort of poetic &quot;soul sister&quot; to 19th century giant Emily Dickinson: they both share an irreverent spirit and a sensuous appreciation of the natural world.<br />Millay was a master of traditional poetic forms; this volume contains several sonnets, as well as other poems in various patterns of meter and rhyme. Millay's genius is that she brings to these traditional forms a charm, wit, and freshness. Many of her poems incorporate classical and literary references: to Apollo, Sappho, Helen, Homer, Guinevere, etc.<br />I especially like the several poems which evoke the sea and the coastline with stunning language. Consider these lines from &quot;Exiled&quot;: &quot;Wanting the sticky, salty sweetness / of the strong wind and shattered spray; / Wanting the loud sound and the soft sound / Of the big surf that breaks all day.&quot;<br />Overall, this is a diverse and enjoyable gathering of poems. Another great standout is the fantasy-flavored &quot;The Singing-Woman from the Wood's Edge,&quot; the first-person account of a being whose &quot;mother was a leprechaun, whose father was a friar.&quot; I should also mention &quot;Recuerdo,&quot; from whose lines I took the title of this review. Edna St. Vincent Millay is a remarkable poet, and I highly recommend &quot;First Fig and Other Poems.&quot;	2001-10-24

Scott Momaday, is an extraordinary work of American literature. In this book Momaday tells the story of Abel, a Native American whose life journey takes him from the rural world of his ancestors to the harsh urban environment of an American city. Along the way Momaday creates passages of great pain, beauty, and wonder.<br />Consider the book's opening lines: &quot;Dypaloh. There was a house made of dawn. It was made of pollen and of rain, and the land was very old and everlasting. There were many colors on the hills, and the plain was bright with different colored clays and sands.&quot; Prose like this gives the book a timeless, mythic flavor, and is stunningly complemented by naturalistic passages that explore such visceral topics as violence, sexual ecstasy, and alcohol abuse.<br />Momaday superbly evokes the people, animals, and geography of the rural West. His book also explores the significance of both oral and written cultural traditions. The book features one of the most intriguing characters in 20th century American fiction: The Rev. J.B.B. Tosameh -- &quot;orator, physician, Priest of the Sun, son of Hummingbird&quot; -- in whose character Momaday explores the collision between Christianity and Native American religious traditions.<br />&quot;House Made of Dawn&quot; has a somewhat fragmented structure. Like William Faulkner, Momaday expects the reader to do some work in assembling the greater story. But such work is rewarding.

This literary form represents the first-person accounts of individuals who have lived as slaves. The Modern Library has paired these two essential American texts in a single edition, with an introduction by Kwame Anthony Appiah and commentaries by Jean Fagan Yellin and Margaret Fuller.<br />Together, &quot;Narrative&quot; and &quot;Incidents&quot; offer a male and female perspective on the institution that has left lasting scars on America. These texts are well written, and rich in social and political insights. Both authors graphically illustrate, for example, how the Judeo-Christan Bible and the Christian church were used as tools to support the racist system of slavery. Douglass provides a powerful window into the importance of literacy as a tool by which he escaped a slave mentality. And Jacobs incisively deconstructs the twisted strands of race, gender, power, and sexuality that tied together slaveowning culture.<br />&quot;Narrative&quot; and &quot;Incidents&quot; are compelling pieces of literature. Moreover, the authors' themes can be seen as foundational for many later works of United States literature: Mark Twain's &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,&quot; Toni Morrison's &quot;Beloved,&quot; Octavia Butler's &quot;Kindred,&quot; and many other texts. Even a popular film like &quot;The Matrix&quot; echoes the slave narratives in some aspects.<br />Douglass and Jacobs are prime examples of writers who superbly combined literary craftsmanship with an intense political commitment. Their achievements make them crucial figures in the field of African-American studies. This combined edition of their outstanding books should be celebrated by teachers, students, reading groups, church study groups, and individual readers.	2001-10-23

Butterfly,&quot; &quot;Golden Child&quot; is a remarkable piece of writing which deserves attention. According to the production history included in the book version, an early version of &quot;Golden Child&quot; premiered in 1996, and a later version was presented at Broadway's Longacre Theatre in 1998. But &quot;Golden Child&quot; is also one of those plays which succeeds purely as a readers' text.<br />&quot;Golden Child&quot; opens with Andrew, a Westernized man of Chinese heritage, who is visited by the ghost of his Chinese-born mother. This brief prologue leads to the story of his mother's girlhood in China. We meet Andrews's grandfather, Tieng-Bin; Tieng-Bin's three wives; and the Western clergyman who seeks to convert them to Christianity.<br />&quot;Golden Child&quot; is a thought-provoking exploration of family life and cross-cultural contact. There is both humor and tragedy in the dialogue. The story addresses such topics as polygamy, foot-binding, ancestor worship, and opium use in traditional Chinese culture. Hwang's ironic portrayal of the politics of &quot;conversion&quot; may be a revelation to those Western Christians who harbor romantic, idealistic notions about bringing the &quot;light&quot; to non-European peoples. I was very impressed with Hwang's writing, and I highly recommend &quot;Golden Child.&quot;	2001-10-23

As the book's subtitle indicates, it is a look at the work of 20th century thinker Hans-Georg Gadamer, whose 1960 book &quot;Truth and Method&quot; looms large in academia. In his introduction, Risser notes that the &quot;aim of this book [...] is to treat philosophical hermeneutics in a more encompassing way, in a way that takes account of the complexity and breadth of the project of philosophical hermeneutics.&quot;<br />Risser reflects on the relationship of Gadamer's work to the work of such related thinkers as Heidegger, Kant, Husserl, Kierkegaard, and Derrida. He addresses the concerns of Gadamer critics John Caputo and Richard Bernstein. Risser looks at some specific controversies surrounding Gadamer's work, such as the debate over Gadamer's concept of &quot;prejudice.&quot;<br />I found one of the more interesting parts of the book to be Risser's look at the relevance of &quot;Buber's distinction between an I-It relation and an I-Thou relation&quot; to Gadamer's work. I was also intrigued by Risser's thoughts on &quot;the concept of play&quot; (&quot;Spiel&quot; in German) in Gadamer's work.<br />If you're turned off by phrases like &quot;an Aristotelico-Hegelian metaphysics of infinity,&quot; you might want to avoid this book. But on the whole I found Risser's prose quite engaging. My main disappointment with the book stems from my expectations regarding the book's title. Risser talks about the voice of the &quot;other,&quot; but I didn't see anything in the book which really explored what makes an &quot;other&quot; an &quot;other.&quot; In particular, I finished the book wondering what relevance Risser's work (and Gadamer's by extension) has on postmodern debates over difference in race, gender, class, etc. Significantly, such terms as &quot;race,&quot; &quot;gender,&quot; etc. don't even appear in the index. My advice: supplement your reading of this book with Adrienne Rich's &quot;Blood, Bread, and Poetry&quot; or Audre Lorde's &quot;Sister Outsider.&quot;<br />Risser's prose gets a bit &quot;touchy-feely&quot; towards the end, as he reflects on commonalities between poetry and philosophy and waxes poetic himself on such concepts on grace, kindness, friendship, and the &quot;radiant word.&quot; (But I admit: I liked the &quot;touchy-feely&quot; stuff.)

Lee, who also coauthored the classic &quot;Inherit the Wind.&quot; &quot;Night&quot; is inspired by the life and writings of Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862), naturalist, political radical, and seminal American intellectual figure. The play was first performed in 1970.<br />&quot;Night&quot; takes place during a night when Thoreau was jailed for an act of civil disobedience: he refused to pay a tax in defiance of the Polk administration's Mexican War. The action of the play consists of a series of interconnected, dreamlike scenes that explore Thoreau's life, ideals, and relationships. We see his theory of education, his strong opposition to slavery, his family ties, and, quite strikingly, his problematic yet enduring relationship with fellow American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson. Particularly moving is Thoreau's encounter with an escaped slave.<br />&quot;Night&quot; is a moving, even inspiring, play. Thoreau is celebrated as not merely a crucial thinker and a great man, but as a truly transcendent figure: a prophet whose voice continues to resound. Highly recommended for literature classes, reading groups, and individual readers.	2001-10-21

This one opens, &quot;I want to be an astronaut, a member of the crew.&quot; Such simple text is combined with Barton's distinctive illustrations. Bright, solid colors and heavy outlines combine to create figures that have an iconic feel; his pictures make me think of a sort of modern variation on Mayan hieroglyphics.<br />In the book we see the space shuttle taking off; astronauts working, eating, and sleeping in zero gravity; a cutaway view of the shuttle; etc. Nice touches include a view of earth from space and the portrayal of a multi-ethnic shuttle crew. Recommended for small kids.	2001-10-21

A prolific poet, Jewish woman, feminist, lesbian, political activist, and mother of three sons, Rich attempts to bring all of the pieces of herself into play as she confronts a host of intellectual, artistic, and ethical issues.<br />As the book's subtitle indicates, all of these pieces were written between 1979 and 1985, and thus the book as a whole serves as a valuable document of the intellectual work of a radical thinker under the neo-conservative shadow of the Reagan era. The book also evokes the waning decade of the Cold War.<br />Rich writes with great passion about feminism, and with great anger about the violence and oppression directed at lesbians from centuries past to the time in which these pieces were written. She often quotes or pays tribute to other writers who have inspired and impacted her: James Baldwin, Audre Lorde, and others.<br />Rich covers much intriguing ground in these prose pieces. &quot;The Problem of Lorraine Hansberry&quot; may inspire you to re-read Hansberry's classic play &quot;A Raisin in the Sun.&quot; &quot;Split at the Root: An Essay on Jewish Identity&quot; is a compelling autobiographical piece that examines her mixed Jewish/gentile heritage, her marriage and life as a mother, and her eventual emergence as a lesbian. A number of essays deal with her interest in the Sandinista revolution of Nicaragua.<br />Despite the often grim and humorless subject matter, I find Rich to be a remarkably engaging writer. At best, her work is challenging and genuinely thoughtful. As companion texts to this worthwhile collection I recommend the following: Audre Lorde's essay collection &quot;Sister Outsider&quot; and Tony Kushner's two-part play &quot;Angels in America.&quot; For complementary perspectives on revolutionary Nicaragua, try the poetry of Gioconda Belli and Daisy Zamora. Finally, check out the two inaugural addresses of Reagan as well as former New York Governor Mario Cuomo's keynote address to the 1984 Democratic Convention; these political speeches can be found in the more recent editions of &quot;A Documentary History of the United States,&quot; edited by Richard Heffner.k out the two inaugural addresses of Reagan as well as former New York Governor Mario Cuomo's keynote address to the 1984 Democratic Convention; these political speeches can be found in the more recent editions of &quot;A Documentary History of the United States,&quot; edited by Richard Heffner.	2001-10-20

Re-reading the book reminded me why I initially fell in love with it. LVC is an interesting, almost hybrid sort of novel: it is a work of science fiction that has the feel of an epic fantasy novel.<br />LVC takes place thousands of years in the future on the distant world of Majipoor, a gigantic world with a population of 20 billion people of many different species: humans; the three-eyed Liimans; the four-armed, &quot;Bigfoot&quot;-like Skandars; the planet's shapeshifting aboriginal folk; and more. Silverberg brilliantly evokes the history, geography, zoology, botany, politics, and architecture of Majipoor, a world of great strangeness and great beauty. The plot takes Silverberg's hero on an epic quest across this richly imagined world.<br />Along the way are some amazing sensations: a view of the crystalline Ghayrog city of Dulorn, a taste of sea-dragon milk, and more. Silverberg addresses many relevant issues: memory, bigotry, responsibility, leadership, and the terrible burdens of history. The art of juggling is a fascinating motif that distinguishes the book. And the whole story is enlivened by Silverberg's superb writing style: accessible and contemporary, yet with a timeless, classic feel. &quot;Lord Valentine's Castle&quot; is a triumph by a master of the fantastic.	2001-10-19
1803728:US	51987970	R2G8XUQYJYEA1	0471243760	699817901	Sacred Fire: The QBR 100 Essential Black Books	Books	3	6	7	N	N	An informative but flawed list	Here's a handy rule: always be wary of any person or institution who claims to have produced a list of &quot;essential&quot; items in any field. A case in point: &quot;Sacred Fire: The QBR 100 Essential Black Books,&quot; by Max Rodriguez, Angeli R. Rasbury, and Carol Taylor. The book is a list of 100 books from the African Diaspora, each with a brief descriptive commentary. The book features a foreword by Charles Johnson. While informative to a degree, this list is, in my opinion, seriously flawed.<br />In his foreword, Johnson mocks other recent attempts to create &quot;essential&quot; lists. He complains, for example, of the &quot;nervous tokenism&quot; of the &quot;100 Best English-Language Novels&quot; list from the Modern Library. Ironically, such criticisms could also be applied to this book! How did they come up with the list? Rodriguez is fuzzy on that point in his intro. He notes that the list stems from a request, addressed to individuals, to name 10 Black books that had the greatest impact on them. Rodriguez claims, &quot;We asked everyone,&quot; then immediately admits that such an absurd statement is false. But he does note that he asked his sister!<br />Most of the books chosen are indeed essential classics. But I found the list as a whole too &quot;safe,&quot; unimaginative, and narrow of vision. Johnson acknowledges the omission of such writers as Samuel Delany and Rita Dove in his foreword. Books with an experimental, cutting edge quality seem to be absent. I was also dismayed by the failure to include many historic literary milestones by African-American women. Books by Black gay men that deal directly with the black gay experience are also largely absent. Black lesbians are represented by a token appearance by Audre Lorde (with her book &quot;Sister Outsider&quot;). A number of groundbreaking anthologies also fail to appear. And where are the Afro-Hispanic writers? Even the remarkable science fiction author Octavia Butler is solely represented by &quot;Kindred&quot; -- an excellent book, but probably the &quot;safest&quot; and most conventional choice from her incredible personal canon.<br />Just a few books I would add to an expanded edition: Adrienne Kennedy's &quot;In One Act,&quot; an anthology of plays by this award-winning, boldly experimental pioneer of drama; Phillis Wheatley's &quot;Poems on Various Subjects,&quot; an 18th century landmark in poetry; Harriet Jacobs' &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,&quot; perhaps the most important autobiography by a 19th-century Black woman; &quot;Nine Plays by Black Women,&quot; a stunning anthology edited by Margaret Wilkerson; and Ann Allen Shockley's &quot;Loving Her,&quot; a novel which broke new ground for the portrayal of sexuality in the Black novel.<br />Also try Audre Lorde's poetic, moving &quot;Zami&quot;; Alexis De Veaux's &quot;Don't Explain: A Song of Billie Holiday,&quot; an amazing biography told in poetic form; &quot;Brother to Brother: New Writings by Black Gay Men,&quot; the anthology edited by Essex Hemphill; &quot;A Puerto Rican in New York and Other Sketches,&quot; by Jesus Colon, who proudly claimed a Black Latino identity decades before it was politically correct; Anna Julia Cooper's &quot;A Voice from the South,&quot; a pioneering collection of essays; &quot;Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology,&quot; edited by Barbara Smith; Pat Parker's &quot;Movement in Black,&quot; the rich poetic testament of an outspoken Black lesbian; and Samuel Delany's &quot;Dhalgren,&quot; an enigmatic epic which extends the boundaries of both science fiction and the African-American novel.

The series is about the Bear family: mom, dad, and the two cubs. In this volume, the two cubs oversleep -- will they miss the school bus?<br />The book contains enjoyable cartoony illustrations that are bright with soft, pastel colors. I especially love the Bear's whimsical house: a hollow tree with Victorian accents and lavender trim. The story is told in an appealing rhyme with simple vocabulary -- great for beginning readers. Example: &quot;It is almost seven, as you can see. / All is quiet in the Bears' Home Sweet Tree.&quot;<br />An nice educational touch to this book is the fact that the Bears' story is accompanied by both traditional clockfaces and digital time displays throughout, thus helping young readers learn how to tell time in both formats. I bought the book for my five year old nephew, and he loved it. Highly recommended.	2001-10-18

But if you wish, ignore the author's history and just go ahead and read the book: it is one of the most powerful, devastating portrayals of African-American life ever written.<br />&quot;Eye&quot; centers around Pecola Breedlove, a small Black girl from a horrifically dysfunctional family (in a 1993 afterword, Morrison describes them as &quot;a crippled and crippling family&quot;). Pecola's story begins in the fall of 1941, but Morrison moves back in time to tell the fuller story of the girl and her family. Morrison's skill as a writer is evident from the opening pages, in which she chillingly deforms the archetypal, Eurocentric &quot;Dick and Jane&quot; readers.<br />A central theme of &quot;Eye&quot; is how Black children's psyches can be damaged by the Eurocentric foci of American popular culture. Figures like the Raggedy Ann dolls and Hollywood stars become ominous figures in Pecola's tragedy. The story is full of memorable, often grotesque characters, such as three prostitutes (described as &quot;merry gargoyles&quot;) whom Pecola loves.<br />&quot;Eye&quot; is full of painful, shocking incidents that illustrate the contours of human cruelty, abuse, and brokenness. I believe that this novel shows Morrison to be a true literary heir of William Faulkner. &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; may strike some readers as just too horrific and depressing, but I believe that it is a novel that deserves an attentive readership.	2001-10-18

Butler. This story begins in 1690, and spans Africa and America. At the heart of &quot;Wild Seed&quot; is the enigmatic relationship between two powerful, and seemingly immortal characters: Doro, a sort of energy being who transfers from one host body to another, killing his hosts in the process; and Anyanwu, a shapeshifter who can assume forms of any species, and of either gender.<br />&quot;Wild Seed&quot; is both a psychologically perspective character study and a profound meditation on power and desire. Butler's philosophical canvas takes in such controversial issues as slavery, race, reproduction, and gender. In addition to being a superb example of the science fiction novel, &quot;Wild Seed&quot; is a stunning historical novel which expands the boundaries of African-American literature. As such, it would make a compelling companion text to such &quot;canonical&quot; novels as Toni Morrison's &quot;Beloved.&quot; Also recommended: any of Butler's other outstanding novels, and her collection &quot;Bloodchild and Other Stories.&quot;	2001-10-18

White, belongs to a special class of literature: a children's book which has much to offer to older teen and adult readers. White's wonderful story is superbly complemented by the charming illustrations of Garth Williams.<br />As the story opens, eight year old farm girl Fern Arable stops her father from killing a piglet who has been labeled the runt of the litter. The little pig, whom Fern names Wilbur, becomes one of the central figures in the story. Eventually he will be befriended by Charlotte, the wise and loving spider mentioned in the book's title.<br />White creates a sort of modern animal fable in which his barnyard characters can speak both with each other and with Fern. White's barn is populated with some truly marvelous characters. Special mention should be made of Templeton the rat. Gluttonous, sneaky, often nasty, but curiously sympathetic, Templeton is one of the great anti-heroes in modern literature.<br />Part of this novel's brilliance is the fact that the author makes a heroine out of a spider: a creature that many people probably regard with fear. Unlike a cute piglet or other barnyard creatures, a spider is a creature vastly different from humans. White's Charlotte is a truly remarkable character. White's witty, compassionate prose style is an ideal vehicle for telling the story of Charlotte and her friends.<br />&quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; is a masterful blend of whimsy, humor, gentle satire, and life-and-death drama. But above all, it is a powerful story of friendship. Deeply moving and superbly written, this is a book which, I believe, will endure as a treasured classic.	2001-10-17

Both the novella and the film tell the stories of Americans living luxurious lives in Europe. Both stories also deal with the issue of social unacceptability, and are haunted by the aura of sexual transgression.<br />James' novella was first published in 1878, making it an early work in the author's illustrious literary career. &quot;Daisy&quot; opens in Switzerland, where Winterbourne, a young American man, meets the title character. An American girl who is described as &quot;an extraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity,&quot; Daisy becomes a troublesome figure for the snobby community of Americans abroad.<br />Some of James' social satire strikes me as rather dated, and I found the conclusion of the tale somewhat unsatisfying. Still, &quot;Daisy&quot; is a well-written tale that, on the whole, remains a good read today. And Daisy herself is a curiously compelling character whose story invites both a serious feminist analysis, as well as an analysis based in economic and class issues. Recommended as a companion text: &quot;Strange Pilgrims,&quot; Gabriel Garcia Marquez' collection of stories about Latin Americans in Europe for various reasons.	2001-10-17

Since the time of the book's initial publication, Sellers has been executed for his crimes. Sellers' claims to fame are his contentions that (1) his involvement in Satanism helped turn him into a murderer, and (2) he became a new man due to his jailhouse conversion to evangelical Christianity.<br />Sellers' story takes up less than 20 pages of this 173 page book. The rest is a weak collection of chapters on various subjects (drugs, alcohol, suicide, occultism, etc.) that have been amply covered in other sources. The apparent purpose of this book is to warn teens and parents about Satanism and related phenomena.<br />For a convicted murderer, Sellers writes with a remarkable attitude of intolerance and arrogance. The entire book is permeated with a sense of strict religious fundamentalism. Sellers, for example, condemns Hindus and Buddhists as idolaters. He even advocates book burning as a positive activity. He attacks the popular &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; game, rock music, and other cultural phenomena.<br />The book is full of undocumented quotes and ridiculous statements. There is also an air of paranoia to the book. Consider the following quote: &quot;Police may endeavor to 'downplay' evidence of satanism in crimes due to public reaction&quot; (chapter 2). He evens alleges that the Washington Monument is a satanic symbol (in chapter 3). Most disturbingly, Sellers seems to be evading responsibility for his own crimes, claiming he was &quot;completely possessed&quot; by demonic forces when he murdered.<br />This is a sad book. Its credibility is not helped by the fact that it has a foreword by Bob Larson, a man known for writing intolerant, sensationalistic books that advocate religious fundamentalism. In the end, &quot;Web of Darkness&quot; seems like a manifestation of the phenomenon called &quot;satanic panic&quot; by sociology professor Jeffrey S. Victor; in fact, I recommend Victor's book &quot;Satanic Panic: The Creation of a Contemporary Legend&quot; for those with a serious interest in the issues raised by Sellers' book.S.

Ward, is a brief biography of the author behind the phenomenal Harry Potter series of children's books. With simple text and plenty of illustrations, this book is geared towards younger readers.<br />The book includes the basic information about Rowling's life and literary career: her childhood, education, literary influences, etc. Ward also briefly discusses Rowling's marriage and divorce, as well as the &quot;birth&quot; of Harry. The book is illustrated with photos of Rowling and of the places in her life. There are also photos of cover art from the Potter books. A number of quotes from the Potter books appear as sidebars. Along the way is some interesting information, such as the fact that, at the time this biography was written, the Harry Potter books had been translated into 28 languages.<br />The book presents the basic information about Rowling, but I didn't see anything particularly new or insightful. And I imagine that many of Rowling's fans already know most or all of the facts in the book (I did). Also, the internal layout of the book is a bit too cluttered for my taste. Overall, a competent but unexceptional biography for younger readers.	2001-10-15

Hughes (1902-1967) is a poet of many moods and voices. His work is at times mournful, humorous, sensuous, or ironic. Many poems capture the rhythms of African-American vernacular speech. A number of narrative poems tell stories of Black life, and a number of his best poems feature female speakers. He also writes poems of social protest that deal with the anti-Black violence that has plagued the United States for so much of its history.<br />The poems in this book are divided into several sections. One of my favorite such sections, &quot;Feet of Jesus,&quot; contains poems which evoke the prayers, preaching, and religious songs of African-American churches. &quot;Madam to You&quot; contains a number of poems in which Alberta K. Johnson tells her story. A strong-willed entrepreneur who often challenges authority figures, &quot;Madam&quot; is one of the most delightful characters in African-American literature.<br />The other sections of the book contain many of Hughes' most memorable poems: the sensuous &quot;Midnight Dancer&quot; (&quot;Lips / Sweet as purple dew&quot;), &quot;Mother to Son&quot; (&quot;Life for me ain't been no crystal stair&quot;), &quot;Theme for English B&quot; (&quot;I am the only colored student in my class&quot;), and &quot;I, Too&quot; (&quot;I, too, sing America. / I am the darker brother&quot;).<br />The lines I quoted from &quot;I, Too&quot; may call to mind Walt Whitman's great American poem &quot;Leaves of Grass.&quot; Indeed, I consider Hughes to be one of the great 20th century poetic heirs of Whitman, and &quot;Selected Poems&quot; is a magnificent testament to Hughes' passion and vision.	2001-10-15

First published in serial form in 1851 and 1852, UTC is, to a large degree, a book of its time. But it has a compelling power that makes it, in my opinion, an authentic classic that deserves the attention of today's readers, and of future generations.<br />Yes, there are many valid criticisms that can be leveled against Stowe and her book. Is it sentimental? Emotionally manipulative? Is Uncle Tom a problematic character? &quot;Yes&quot; to all these questions. But Stowe also achieves a remarkable sense of balance in the book as a whole. The too-good-to-be-true, long-suffering Tom is complemented by the more militant George. And Stowe achieves some truly incisive cultural criticism. Particularly resonant is her analysis (often through the dialogue of her characters) of the use of both Christianity and the law as tools by which the oppressive slave system was supported.<br />Stowe is up front with her anti-slavery beliefs. UTC is notable for Stowe's many asides to her readers; her omniscient narrator seems to be maintaining a continual &quot;conversation&quot; with the reader. Despite the book's flaws, I found it to be a gripping read, filled with some truly memorable characters. Despite its length, the novel is a very fluid read.<br />I fear that UTC is regarded by many as more of a cultural monument -- a literary &quot;museum piece,&quot; if you will -- then as living literature that one would actually read. That's a pity; I think that Stowe's compassion, keen intelligence, and remarkable writerly skill make UTC a classic that is actually worth reading.<br />Like James Fenimore Cooper's &quot;The Last of the Mohicans,&quot; UTC is a flawed but monumental novel that represents a serious and thoughtful attempt to portray non-white American characters. And as with Cooper's book, I think that UTC should be read in connection with 18th and 19th century books by ethnic Americans themselves: as companion texts to UTC, I particularly recommend &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; and Harriet Jacobs' &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.&quot;<br />One other note: a number of authors adapted UTC for the stage in the 19th century. One such adaptation, by George L. Aiken, can be found in the excellent anthology &quot;Early American Drama,&quot; edited by Jeffrey H. Richards. My final comment: If you haven't read this novel, toss away any preconceptions you may have, and read it with an open mind. &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; is an extraordinary achievement.TC should be read in connection with 18th and 19th century books by ethnic Americans themselves: as companion texts to UTC, I particularly recommend &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&quot; and Harriet Jacobs' &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.&quot;<br />One other note: a number of authors adapted UTC for the stage in the 19th century.

Books	5	10	10	N	N	Stories of Asian-American life	&quot;Seventeen Syllables and Other Stories,&quot; by Hisaye Yamamoto, was first published in 1988. The revised and expanded edition adds 4 more stories, for a total of 19. Yamamoto was born in 1921 in California to parents who were immigrants from Japan, and hers is one of the most remarkable voices in 20th century United States literature. These stories originally were written or published between 1942 and 1995, and thus represent many decades of Yamamoto's literary career.<br />Her style is a blend of delicacy and determined passion. The book as a whole strikes a balance between tragedy and tenderness, and her best stories are quite moving. Yamamoto's stories mainly have Japanese-American female protagonists, and offer glimpses into many decades of Japanese-American life. Some topics include troubled marriages, crippling addictions, racism, and relations among the many ethnic groups of the U.S.<br />Some stories deal with the experience of Japanese-Americans who were incarcerated in concentration camps by their own government during World War II. Other important themes include the human toll of World War II on those Japanese Americans who lost family members in the war, and the cultural shift between generations in Japanese-American families.<br />The four new stories in the expanded edition are &quot;Death Rides the Rails in Poston,&quot; a murder mystery; &quot;Eucalyptus,&quot; about a woman's experience in a mental facility; &quot;A Fire in Fontana,&quot; about a Japanese-American woman's connection to the African-American community; and &quot;Florentine Gardens,&quot; which centers around a visit to a military cemetery in Italy.<br />Hisaye Yamamoto's work is highly regarded by many, and many of her stories have been anthologized (which is how I first read her work). It is wonderful to have her stories brought together in one volume; I feel richer for having read &quot;Seventeen Syllables and Other Stories.&quot; One final note: as a fitting complement to the title story of this collection, I recommend Richard Wright's book &quot;Haiku: This Other World.&quot;e title story of this collection, I recommend Richard Wright's book &quot;Haiku: This Other World.&quot;	2001-10-15

This play deals with life in prison; its flavor of authenticity probably comes from the fact that the author himself had spent time in prison.<br />&quot;Short Eyes&quot; involves a multiethnic group of inmates whose lives are affected by the incarceration of a mild-mannered white man charged with a particularly shocking crime. Pinero creates a fascinating portrayal of a racially fractured subculture in which whites are the minority. His prison is populated with many memorable characters: the African-American inmate El Raheem, whose &quot;Black Muslim&quot;-inspired dialogue is marked by quick wordplay and messianic fury; Longshoe, the tough white inmate; Cupcakes, the pretty-boy who is the object of another inmate's lust, and more.<br />Pinero's claustrophobic world of Blacks, Puerto Ricans, and whites could be seen as a frightening microcosm of the larger American society: a world of destructive compulsions and violence. Pinero's dialogue is often penetrating and shocking; his characters are alive with raw pain and rage. &quot;Short Eyes&quot; may be too much for some readers to handle, but those with a serious interest in American drama or Puerto Rican literature, this is a remarkable work of art.	2001-10-12

It tells the story of Marty, an 11-year old boy who seeks to shelter an abused beagle from his hard-hearted owner. Reynolds lets Marty tell his story in the first person, and her excellent prose captures the rhythms of rural West Virginia speech (and I say this because I spend a lot of time there with my extended family). Reynolds had me hooked with her opening sentence: &quot;The day Shiloh come, we're having us a big Sunday dinner.&quot; Reynold's skill at rendering American vernacular speech evokes, in my mind, favorable comparisons to such authors as Zora Neale Hurston and Alice Walker.<br />&quot;Shiloh&quot; is rich with the details of life in that region: the food, the hunting, and social customs. Reynolds creates a wonderful portrait of a poor but loving family. But the heart of the book is the way she captures the special bond between a boy and his dog.<br />&quot;Shiloh&quot; is an &quot;issue&quot; book in the sense that it deals with animal cruelty, but Reynolds wisely tells a realistic story without overtly preaching at the reader. But the book still raises very relevant issues. Marty's moral dilemma is not presented as an easy &quot;black-and-white&quot; situation. Shiloh's owner, Judd, is not a cardboard villain. Marty's ethical and theological inner struggle is comparable to that of the title character in Mark Twain's &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.&quot; Like Huck, Marty is a compelling hero: courageous, loyal, and thoughtful.<br />In short, &quot;Shiloh&quot; is a contemporary classic, a book with true moral and psychological resonance. Naylor's portrayal of the enduring ties between a child and a beloved animal is comparable to such enduring works as John Steinbeck's &quot;The Red Pony.&quot; This moving book deserves a wide audience.resonance.

The honor was well deserved. &quot;Sarah&quot; is a warm, moving story.<br />&quot;Sarah&quot; is a story told in the first-person by Anna, a young farm girl who lives with her widowed father and younger brother, Caleb. Anna's father sends by mail for a prospective new wife: Sarah, a woman from the Maine seacoast. As the story unfolds, Sarah arrives on the farm and gets to know the family.<br />MacLachlan writes in a simple but poetic style that expertly conveys the emotions of her characters. MacLachlan is wonderful at catching the details of farm life, which the reader discovers along with Sarah. I also like the way MacLachlan evokes the Maine coastal landscape through Sarah's dialogue. There is a subtle suspense to the story: will Sarah decide to stay and become a part of the story?<br />I won't give away the ending. But I will say that &quot;Sara&quot; is a gentle and compassionate book for readers of all ages.	2001-10-10
1816299:US	51987970	R3FQ2TQZ6W8EQZ	0679776435	575217886	Eight American Poets: An Anthology	Books	4	7	8	N	N	From &quot;Six&quot; to &quot;Eight&quot;	&quot;Eight American Poets,&quot; edited by Joel Conarroe, is a fine anthology. The introduction notes that this book was &quot;designed as a companion volume to 'Six American Poets,'&quot; also edited by Conarroe. &quot;Eight&quot; follows the same plan as &quot;Six&quot;: rather than anthologize a huge company of poets who are represented by only a few pieces each, each of Conarroe's books focuses on a relatively small group of poets, each of whom is represented by a substantial selection. Conarroe's approach allows the reader to get a fuller feel of each poet in the anthology format.<br />The poets of &quot;Eight&quot; are Theodore Roethke, Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Lowell, John Berryman, Anne Sexton, Sylvia Plath, Allen Ginsburg, and James Merrill. Each poet's work is prefaced by a substantial individual introduction.<br />There are many masterpieces in this book. Curiously, I found the most compelling poems to be those that focus on nature: Roethke's &quot;The Meadow Mouse,&quot; Bishop's &quot;The Fish,&quot; Plath's &quot;Mushrooms,&quot; and Merrill's &quot;The Octopus.&quot; Poems like these combine skillfully used language with keen insight, and reveal these poets to be true heirs of Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson (two of the featured artists in &quot;Six American Poets&quot;).<br />Overall, I felt that &quot;Eight&quot; was not as strong as its sister volume, &quot;Six.&quot; Although there are many poetic masterpieces in &quot;Eight,&quot; there is also much material which, in my opinion, hasn't aged well. The so-called &quot;confessional poetry&quot; of some of these writers strikes me as overwrought. Some of the longer poems failed to resonate with me. I was particularly disappointed by Berryman's &quot;Homage to Mistress Bradstreet,&quot; especially since I am an admirer of Anne Bradtreet's own work. Admittedly, this criticism may merely reflect my own personal tastes, but I submit it for the reader's consideration.<br />The fact that so many of these poets either wrote about each other, or pop up in the editor's introductions to each others' work, sometimes gives the book as a whole a creepy, incestuous feel. And the fact that so many of these poets committed suicide, had long-term mental health problems, and/or suffered from addictions further gives the book as a whole a rather morbid feel. On second thought, maybe this group of eight is a bit problematic!<br />Still, editor Conarroe has assembled an impressive anthology that I would recommend for students and teachers, as well as to a general readership.

I was greatly impressed with &quot;Great Short Stories by American Women,&quot; the anthology edited by Candace Ward. The stories in this volume were originally published between 1861 and 1930, and represent the work of some of the United States' best writers. The contents of the book are as follows:<br />Rebecca Harding Davis' &quot;Life in the Iron Mills,&quot; a compelling piece of social protest; Louisa May Alcott's &quot;Transcendental Wild Oats,&quot; a satiric view of life in a Utopian commune; Sarah Orne Jewett's &quot;A White Heron,&quot; a reflection on men, women, and nature; Mary E. Wilkins Freeman's &quot;A New England Nun,&quot; about an extended engagement; Charlotte Perkins Gilman's creepy &quot;The Yellow Wall-Paper,&quot; about a woman who, diagnosed with &quot;a slight hysterical tendency,&quot; is forced to undergo an oppressive treatment; Kate Chopin's lusty, sensuous &quot;The Storm&quot;; Edith Wharton's &quot;The Angel at the Grave,&quot; an ironic study of the legacy of a famous philosopher; Willa Cather's &quot;Paul's Case,&quot; a tale about a dandyish young man who just can't fit into society; Alice Dunbar-Nelson's &quot;The Stones of the Village,&quot; a study of racism, shame, and secrecy; Susan Glaspell's &quot;A Jury of Her Peers,&quot; a murder mystery which the author adapted from her own one-act play entitled &quot;Trifles&quot;; Djuna Barnes' multigenerational family story &quot;Smoke&quot;; Zora Neale Hurston's &quot;Sweat,&quot; a story of a nightmarishly bad marriage; and Nella Larsen's chilling &quot;Sanctuary.&quot;<br />This is an excellent, richly varied selection of thirteen tales. Unfortunately, the brief intros to each tale and its author commit the two cardinal sins of such intros: (1) They are excessively intrusive, sometimes revealing the stories' endings; and (2) they often leave out relevant information -- such as the knowledge that both Edith Wharton and Susan Glaspell received Pulitzer Prizes for their writing.<br />So, if you skip the brief story/author intros, you will find this to be a fine anthology, good both for literature courses and for individual reading./>So, if you skip the brief story/author intros, you will find this to be a fine anthology, good both for literature courses and for individual reading.	2001-10-08

First published in 1826, the book represents an early attempt to create substantial literary art from the material of North American history and geography. Although the book has its flaws, it is for the most part a success.<br />In the novel, the white woodsman Hawk-eye and his Mohican Indian comrade Chingachgook join forces to help the daughters of a white military officer through hostile territory. The story takes place in a colonial American setting marked by conflict between French and English forces -- a conflict that also involves various Indian nations.<br />There are a number of exciting (and often graphically violent) scenes of battle and chase. Hawk-eye, a white man who, to a large degree, rejects European-American values, is a fascinating figure -- indeed, he is one of the most enduring fictional creations in all of United States literature. Through the mouths of Hawk-eye and the various Indian characters, Cooper offers some intriguing criticisms of white culture.<br />As I said, the book is not without flaws. The momentum of the book lags for a brief stretch, and some of Cooper's characters (in particular, his women) at times sound a bit stereotypical. But the overall power and intelligence of Cooper's work is undeniable. Particularly impressive is his re-creation of a multilingual world of complex cultural and personal conflict. Also noteworthy is his evocation of the American landscape. A tale of death and survival, of betrayal and loyalty, and, above all, of the extraordinary bond between a white man and an Indian, &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; is one classic that deserves to be read and reevaluated by each generation.	2001-10-05

The original plays are as follows: &quot;Funnyhouse of a Negro&quot; (which won an Obie Award for the 1964-65 theater season), &quot;The Owl Answers,&quot; &quot;A Lesson in Dead Language,&quot; &quot;A Rat's Mass,&quot; &quot;Sun,&quot; and &quot;A Movie Star Has to Star in Black and White.&quot; The Greek adaptations are &quot;Electra&quot; and &quot;Orestes.&quot;<br />Kennedy's original work is surreal and nightmarish. Her most striking plays feature African-American female protagonists, and explore such topics as failed marriage, racial segregation, middle-class Black aspiration, sexual transgression, guilt, and the conflict between light- and dark-skinned African-Americans.<br />Kennedy often uses bizarre props and stage directions, as well as weird and unsettling dialogue. Her plays often employ iconic figures from Western culture: European royalty, classic Hollywood stars, and characters from Christian tradition. Kennedy has a sharp satiric eye, and her characters are frequently suffering from intense pain.<br />&quot;A Lesson. . .&quot; and &quot;A Rat's Mass&quot; feature grotesque half-human, half-animal figures. &quot;A Movie Star. . .&quot; has as its main character a Black female aspiring playwright, and incorporates references to other plays in this collection; this piece thus has a particularly reality-warping feel.<br />Adrienne Kennedy's drama has a boldly experimental and psychological quality. Although her experiments don't always work, when they do the result is stunning.	2001-10-05

But the events of the play take place more than 250 years prior to that time. The literal action of the play concerns a real historical phenomenon: the &quot;witch hunts&quot; that took place in Salem in the 1690s. But the play could also be read as a metaphor for the era of McCarthyism (1950-54), during which a United States senator led the country in a frenzied and destructive modern-day &quot;witch hunt&quot; for suspected Communists.<br />&quot;The Crucible&quot; is a stunning exploration of jealousy, lust, mistrust, rumor mongering, religious fanaticism, and the arrogance of power. Miller's dialogue crackles with energy, and his characters are compellingly real. The play as a whole is graced by the author's intelligence and compassion. By turns infuriating, horrifying, heartbreaking, and inspiring, this is truly one of the masterworks of the American stage.<br />The play succeeds in book form as a gripping read. Although I have never seen a stage production, I heartily recommend the excellent 1996 film version, directed by Nicholas Hytner, and featuring a superb ensemble cast that includes Daniel Day-Lewis. A fitting companion text to &quot;The Crucible&quot; would be &quot;Inherit the Wind,&quot; the excellent play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee; like &quot;The Crucible,&quot; this play explores a real American historical event involving religious fanaticism.	2001-10-03

The play tells the story of two women: Callie, a New York City traffic reporter, and Sara, a schoolteacher transplanted from St. Louis. Their growing attraction to each other is impacted by an act of homophobic violence.<br />Son tells the story in nonlinear fashion; this technique is very effective. Ultimately, &quot;Stop Kiss&quot; is a moving exploration of violence and survival, and of the tension between remaining silent and bearing witness. This is a play that also works in book form as a reader's text. I recommend it for those with an interest in contemporary playwriting or in the sociological issue of bias-related violence.	2001-10-02

The book includes several chapters, each of which is dedicated to a major religious tradition: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Shinto. There is also a &quot;catch-all&quot; chapter which gives limited information on other traditions: the Jain faith, the Baha'i faith, Rastafarianism, etc.<br />The various chapters describe certain aspects of these religions: the founding figure, customs, festivals, rites of passage, holy books, etc. The articles also describe some of the diversity in each tradition. The book also has a helpful glossary at the end.<br />The book is not without flaws and inconsistencies. For example, the authors mention &quot;new cults&quot; without really explaining the term. Also, they seem to leave out any real acknowledgment of secular humanism, atheism, or religious liberalism.<br />Overall, the book presents a rather sanitized look at world religions. The authors write, &quot;As long as we respect each other's beliefs and allow people to practice their religion freely, the world should be a happier place. Religion can help us to live like brothers and sisters.&quot; A nice sentiment, but often far from harsh reality. Despite its flaws, however, &quot;What I Believe&quot; is an admirable achievement overall.	2001-10-02

The other main characters are Jody's parents and the ranch hand Billy Buck. Also frequently appearing are the ranch dogs, Doubletree Mutt and Smasher.<br />&quot;The Red Pony&quot; is not a novel, so readers expecting the cohesion and unity of a novel will be disappointed. The book should, in my opinion, be evaluated for what it is. And once you appreciate its own peculiar structure, you may, as I did, acknowledge &quot;The Red Pony&quot; as a powerful and beautiful work of art.<br />Steinbeck masterfully captures the cycles of life, death, and renewal in the lives of both his human and animal characters. He creates vivid, often visceral scenes, that are written in a quietly powerful language. There are moving moments of joy, horror, and heartbreak. &quot;The Red Pony&quot; is a significant achievement by one of America's enduring literary giants.	2001-10-01

Books	4	5	5	N	N	Thanks, Isaac	&quot;Gold&quot; is, according to the book's cover, the final science fiction collection from Isaac Asimov. One of the genre's most revered figures, Asimov died in 1992. &quot;Gold&quot; contains both short stories and a bunch of short essays. While the material in &quot;Gold&quot; does not quite reach the level of Asimov's best work, the book is still worth reading.<br />Part One of &quot;Gold&quot; sandwiches 13 short stories in between two longer tales of about 40 pages each. I found most of the shorter tales to be fairly forgettable, but the longer ones are fine pieces. The first of the two longer tales, &quot;Cal,&quot; is a cleverly written tale of a robot who wants to be a writer. This is a moving tale which effectively returns to one of Asimov's great themes (the place of robots in human-dominated society). The second of the longer tales, &quot;Gold,&quot; is a compelling story of a science fiction writer who hires a director to make a &quot;compu-drama&quot; out of one of his books. This thoughtful story is an interesting commentary on two things: (1) the relationship of science fiction to canonical &quot;high&quot; literature, and (2) the relationship of science fiction books to science fiction in other media.<br />The short essays are a mixed bag, but the best of them are delightful. They are full of amusing and enlightening anecdotes, often about other classic SF writers of Asimov's generation. Some of Asimov's essay topics include women and SF, religion and SF, the SF short-short story, plagiarism, and the background to the names of some of his fictional characters. Asimov's essay on book reviewing is particularly interesting; I think that everyone who participates in the Amazon review program should read this essay (entitled &quot;Book Reviews,&quot; it's on pages 369-374 of the paperback edition).<br />Finally, a personal note. Isaac Asimov was one of my childhood icons, and many of his classic stories had a profound influence on me. I will also never forget the opportunity I had to hear him speak in person at a New York City convention: he was as delightful and charming in person as he is in print. If you are a fan of Asimov or of that great generation of SF writers in general, don't miss &quot;Gold.&quot;forget the opportunity I had to hear him speak in person at a New York City convention: he was as delightful and charming in person as he is in print.

First published in 1682, this autobiographical text represents a genre of literature known as the &quot;captivity narrative&quot;: a first-person account of a white settler who was held as a hostage or prisoner by Native Americans. In Rowlandson's case, she was taken captive during Metacom's War (also known as King Philip's War), which took place in 1675-1676.<br />The edition of Rowlandson's book edited by Neal Salisbury is excellent. This edition contains Rowlandson's text, together with a wealth of other materials: a thorough introduction, many maps, a chronology, a bibliography, and other historic documents from Rowlandson's era. The many illustrations include photographs of the title pages of earlier editions.<br />Rowlandson's captivity narrative is a significant milestone in American literature; the introduction to the Salisbury edition notes that the text &quot;has been almost continually in print since 1770.&quot; Since the text itself is relatively short, it has appeared in anthologies (see, for example, &quot;The Harper Single Volume American Literature,&quot; third edition). But the many &quot;extras&quot; in the Salisbury edition definitely make it a book worth buying, even if you have an anthology already containing the Rowlandson text.<br />Rowlandson's memoir itself is not great literature stylistically. But it is a fascinating text with some really striking passages. Rowlandson's extreme evangelical Puritanism will likely alienate or bewilder some modern readers, but her religious attitude should be read in historic and cultural context. Similarly, her extremely racist descriptions of Indians (&quot;merciless Heathen,&quot; &quot;ravenous Beasts,&quot; etc.) should to be read in context (but should not be trivialized, especially in multiethnic classrooms where this text might be taught).<br />This book is a significant document of contact between cultures in times of extreme crisis. It is an especially intriguing text for those careful readers who really try to read &quot;between the lines.&quot; Recommended as companion texts: William Apess' &quot;A Son of the Forest and Other Writings&quot; (Apess was a pioneer Native American writer) and James Fenimore Cooper's novel &quot;The Last of the Mohicans.&quot;might be taught).<br />This book is a significant document of contact between cultures in times of extreme crisis.

The Qu'ran of Islam. The Dhammapada of Buddhism. To these, and other immortal sacred texts of the world's great religions, we can add the Principia Discordia, the foundational text of Discordianism.<br />Since I first read the Principia (also known as the Magnum Opiate of Malaclypse the Younger), it has become one of my favorite books. I recommend the edition that contains an introduction by &quot;Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst&quot; (also known as Kerry Thornley), who is celebrated in a cover blurb as &quot;the co-founder of Discordianism.&quot;<br />Thornley opens his delightful intro, &quot;If organized religion is the opium of the masses, then disorganized religion is the marijuana of the lunatic fringe.&quot; Discordianism, which is inspired by the Greek goddess of chaos and confusion, is such a disorganized religion. In his intro Thornley recalls the founding/revelation of Discordianism in 1958 or 1959 in a bowling alley in California.<br />The Principia itself could be read as a collage-like satire of conventional religions and their sacred texts. The book is a merry blend of jokes, puns, satiric narratives, parodic songs and rituals, word games, illustrations, and secret ciphers. Among the gems in the book are the Law of Fives, an explanation of the Discordian calendar, and information about the Bavarian Illuminati (&quot;The World's Oldest And Most Successful Conspiracy&quot;).<br />One section of the book notes that the Discordian Society &quot;has been called a guerrilla mind theatre.&quot; The Principia is a manifesto of this theatre.

The play follows seven African-American characters, both male and female, in Pittsburgh in 1948. The first scene opens after the funeral of one character, and the play then moves back in time to tell his story.<br />There is a lot of excellent material in this play. Wilson expertly weaves in songs, humor, one character's recipe for turnip greens, and a funny discourse on the difference between Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi roosters. One character, Floyd, is a talented musician, and his arc offers a perspective on African-American artistic aspiration.<br />Probably the most memorable character in the play is Hedley, a hardworking entrepreneur who is tormented by rage and lust. His dialogue is particularly rich, as he invokes Toussaint L'Ouverture, Marcus Garvey, and traditional African-American biblical interpretation. Overall, &quot;Seven Guitars&quot; is a frequently compelling play with well-written dialogue.	2001-09-29

While there is much that is admirable in the play, I think it is one of those works that probably needs to be seen, rather than read in book form. As a book, I found it an oddly uninvolving read.<br />&quot;Lesson&quot; is about the conflict in an African-American family over an heirloom piano, decorated with carvings, that dates back to the slavery era. This may be one of the play's problems as a reader's text: it relies heavily on a visual element which needs the collaboration of a skilled prop master.<br />Still, &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; has many elements which make it worthwhile in book form. The playwright brings up such compelling issues as African-American land ownership, economic independence, and family heritage. And much of the dialogue is quite sharp. Give it a try.	2001-09-29

But you don't have to wait to see a stage or video version of the play. &quot;Streetcar&quot; is one of those theatrical triumphs which also succeeds in book form as a compelling read.<br />Taking place in New Orleans, &quot;Streetcar&quot; tells the painful story of aging southern belle Blanche DuBois, her sister Stella, Stella's brutish husband Stanley, and the circle of people who frequent Stella's home. Williams creates an incisive examination of human sexuality and socioeconomic difference. His characters come to life with powerful dialogue; this play is a heartbreaking read.<br />A compelling companion text for &quot;Streetcar&quot; would be Eugene O'Neill's classic play &quot;Anna Christie,&quot; which won the Pulitzer for the 1921-22 theater season. Like &quot;Streetcar,&quot; &quot;Anna&quot; deals with male expectations of female sexuality in a powerful way.<br />Willams' Blanche is truly one of the most memorable female characters in United States literature. &quot;Streetcar&quot; is an unforgettable tapestry of desire, shame, and disturbing revelations. An essential text for anybody with an interest in 20th century drama.	2001-09-29

Lee, premiered on Broadway during the 1955-56 theater season. But the play's genesis (no pun intended) lies in the events of 1925. In that year, a high school teacher named John Scopes was put on trial in Tennessee for violating a law that forbade the teaching of Darwinian evolution. With William Jennings Bryan for the prosecution and Clarence Darrow for the defense, this became one of the most important trials in United States history. The trial remains a key battle in the ongoing war of biblical literalism versus science and reason.<br />The play freely adapts the details of history. The authors even change the names of the principal characters involved: Bryan becomes &quot;Matthew Harrison Brady,&quot; Darrow becomes &quot;Henry Drummond,&quot; etc. But the core events of that historic trial remain firmly embedded in the play.<br />&quot;Inherit&quot; is an excellent play that is very readable in book form. Lawrence and Lee write superb dialogue, and create vivid characters in Brady, Drummond, and the rest. The play is an effective satire of religious fundamentalism.<br />With the continuing efforts of religious fundamentalists to force their views on the general public (both in the United States and elsewhere), &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; remains as relevant as ever. Highly recommended.	2001-09-28

The book tells the story of an elderly Cuban fisherman and of his epic struggle with a gigantic marlin.<br />This is a simple, straightforward story of courage and endurance. For most of the book, the old man is totally alone (aside from the animals he encounters) on his boat. Hemingway fills the book with memorable details about marine life and the fisherman's trade. An interesting touch is the invocation, throughout the book, of U.S. baseball player Joe DiMaggio as an iconic figure.<br />Hemingway's style has been justly celebrated over the decades, and his writing in this book is remarkable. In &quot;The Old Man&quot; he achieves a purity, clarity, and stark beauty that remind me of the poetry of Stephen Crane. This book is an enduring classic, and Hemingway's old man is one of the most memorable characters in American literature. If you like this book, also try &quot;The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor,&quot; by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.	2001-09-28

The editor has produced a compact but meaty book of just under 100 pages.<br />The texts included are as follows: Patrick Henry's &quot;Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death&quot; speech; the Declaration of Independence; the Constitution (with all 27 Amendments); &quot;The Federalist&quot; #10; George Washington's First Inaugural and Farewell Addresses; Thomas Jefferson's First Inaugural Address; the Monroe Doctrine; William Lloyd Garrison's prospectus for &quot;The Liberator,&quot; an anti-slavery periodical; Andrew Jackson's 1832 Bank Bill veto; Abraham Lincoln's First and Second Inaugural Addresses; the Emancipation Proclamation; and the Gettysburg Address.<br />These are critical documents, and it is excellent to have them together in a compact volume. I think the book would have been enhanced, however, with the inclusion of a few texts by women or ethnic minorities: perhaps one of Abigail Adams' insightful letters to her husband, an article from abolitionist David Walker's &quot;Appeal,&quot; or an excerpt from the writings of pioneering Native American writer William Apess. Certainly texts like these reflect (to quote from the Introduction) &quot;the ideas, issues, and conflicts which dominated American political life in those first nine decades.&quot; Still, this is a fine anthology, and I recommend it both for classroom use and individual reading.	2001-09-27

The book also contains a substantial introduction by Conrad Wright. The three historic pieces contained in the book are as follows: William Ellery Channing's &quot;Unitarian Christianity&quot; (delivered in 1819), Ralph Waldo Emerson's &quot;Divinity School Address&quot; (1838), and Theodore Parker's &quot;The Transient and Permanent in Christianity&quot; (1841). In his introduction, Wright notes that all three orations caused &quot;widespread controversy.&quot; Indeed, all these decades later, I think that these men still have some bold ideas.<br />These speeches reflect conflicts that are still active in United States Christianity. Channing warns against the practice of selectively reading certain parts of the Judeo-Christian Bible in a literal way. He warns, &quot;The ambitious continue to find doctrines in the Bible, which favor their love of dominion.&quot; Emerson looks forward to a new revelation, complementary to the Bible, to emerge in the Western world. Parker warns against turning the Judeo-Christian Bible into a sort of &quot;idol.&quot;<br />These speeches are fascinating to read, and the ideas expressed in them remain relevant. This is an excellent book for those with an interest in U.S. religious history, or for those who want to hear voices that express an alternative to the soul-killing doctrines of the &quot;religious right.&quot;	2001-09-27

Books	4	12	16	N	N	&quot;You're right at the meat of things, baby&quot;	Edward Albee's play &quot;Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf&quot; is one of those plays that is also a great read as a book. The play involves an older college professor who, with his foul-mouthed wife, plays sick mind games with a younger prof and the younger prof's wife. Albee creates some taught drama with these four characters.<br />I understand that this play was considered quite shocking when it premiered on Broadway in the early 1960s. Some of its language (&quot;monkey-nipples&quot;?) and revelations will probably sound tame, or even quaint, to contemporary readers. But the play as a whole really stands the test of time. And much of the dialogue remains sharp and memorable (like the suggestive line I borrowed to use as the title of my review).<br />The three acts of the play are suggestively subtitled: &quot;Fun and Games,&quot; &quot;Walpurgisnacht,&quot; and &quot;The Exorcism.&quot; &quot;Who's Afraid...&quot; is a memorable text, filled with bitter humor, rage, and despair.	2001-09-25

The lecture is dominated by a central parable: about an elderly African-American woman sage who is questioned by some young people.<br />This parable is a bit overdone, and I found it less than convincing by the end of the text. But the lecture as a whole is thought provoking and even inspiring. Morrison's language is elegant and powerful, and she shares important insights. Especially important, in my opinion, are her cautionary words about the potential use of language as an oppressive force. Overall, I find Morrison's Nobel Lecture to be a fascinating component of her larger body of work.	2001-09-25

The editors celebrate the 10-minute play as a unique and powerful sub-genre of drama; in their introduction, they note that the 10-minute play made its \\"official debut\\" as a genre at the Actors Theatre of Louisville's 1977 Humana Festival of New American Plays.<br />This anthology contains 32 plays by a diverse group of authors. Included are some of the most important names in the American theater: Tony Kushner, Christopher Durang, David Mamet, August Wilson, etc. There are also many names that are new to me. The plays cover many different themes: love and heartbreak (both of the gay and straight varieties), violence, crime, sports, phone sex, death, racial politics, etc. There are many different tones and stylistic approaches: tragic, whimsical, surreal, raunchy, etc. The plays include one-character monologues, 2-character pieces, and multi-character pieces.<br />There are many highlights to this excellent collection. My favorite pieces included the following: David Ives' \\"The Philadelphia,\\" a witty Twilight Zone-ish comedy; Mary Miller's charming \\"Ferris Wheel\\"; Jose Rivera's \\"Gas,\\" which takes place on the U.S. homefront during the Persian Gulf War; Frederick Stroppel's \\"Judgment Call,\\" an ironic look into the world of baseball umpires; and Diana Son's \\"R.A.W.

The book is edited by Barry O'Connell, who also provides an introduction. Apess (1798-1839), of the Pequot Indian people, was a pioneer Native American writer. In addition to his 1831 autobiography, &quot;A Son of the Forest,&quot; this volume also contains &quot;The Experiences of Five Christian Indians of the Pequot Tribe&quot; (1832) and his &quot;Eulogy on King Philip&quot; (1836).<br />Apess' writing is dominated by his fervent evangelical Christianity, and also by his articulation of a Native American consciousness. &quot;Son&quot; is at times a very gripping autobiography. In it Apess writes about poverty, child abuse, alcoholism, ethnic identity and religious conversion: all topics that remain very relevant over the centuries. This volume contains, in addition to the primary texts, a useful bibliography and chronology. This book is an excellent choice both for the classroom and for the independent reader.	2001-09-23

This novel is truly one of those great works that remains both entertaining and deeply moving; it is a book for classrooms, for reading groups of all types, and for individual readers.<br />In &quot;There Eyes,&quot; Hurston tells the life story of Janie, an African-American woman. We accompany Janie as she experiences the very different men in her life. Hurston's great dialogue captures both the ongoing &quot;war of the sexes,&quot; as well as the truces, joys, and tender moments of male-female relations. But equally important are Janie's relationships with other Black women. There are powerful themes of female bonding, identity, and empowerment which bring an added dimension to this book.<br />But what really elevates &quot;Their Eyes&quot; to the level of a great classic is Hurston's use of language. This is truly one of the most poetic novels in the American canon. Hurston blends the engaging vernacular speech of her African-American characters with the lovely &quot;standard&quot; English of her narrator, and in both modes creates lines that are just beautiful.<br />&quot;Their Eyes&quot; captures the universal experiences of pain and happiness, love and loss. And the whole story is told with both humor and compassion. If you haven't read it yet, read it; if you've already read it, read it again.	2001-09-23

The book has been edited by Vincent Carretta, who also provides an introduction and notes. Wheatley, a Black African-born woman, was taken from her homeland as a child and sold into slavery in the United States. Her owners provided her with an excellent education, and she became a poet: indeed, a foremother of African-American poetry.<br />This volume contains Wheatley's poems, including the contents of her historic collection &quot;Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral&quot; (1773).The book also contains more than 20 of her letters, thus allowing readers to appreciate her prose style. As appendixes, the book also contains the writings of three other pioneering New World poets of African heritage: Lucy Terry Prince (c. 1730-1821), Jupiter Hammon (1711-c. 1806), and Francis Williams (c. 1700-c. 1770). Seeing the works of these Black poets helps one to read Wheatley's work in a larger context.<br />Yes, one could say that some of Wheatley's work is derivative and repetitive. But the best of her poetry is truly extraordinary: technically impressive, moving, and thought-provoking. Much of her work is animated by her fervent evangelical Christian beliefs. But particularly significant are those poems that articulate an African or African-American consciousness. The most noteworthy of her poems invite careful re-reading. And the collection of her letters creates a fascinating portrait of a young African-American woman striving to create a career for herself as a literary artist in the 18th century. This book is essential for those with a serious interest in U.S. history and literature, as well as for those with an interest in African Diaspora studies.	2001-09-23

In her introduction to the book version, the author describes the work as &quot;a choreopoem&quot; made up of individual poems that form &quot;a single statement.&quot; This work of literature is a powerful exploration of the lives of Black women.<br />&quot;For colored girls...&quot; does not have a conventional &quot;plot&quot; or characters. The parts of the choreopoem are performed by characters described as &quot;lady in brown,&quot; &quot;lady in white,&quot; etc. Together, these women talk about spirituality, violence, female sexuality, music, and the discovery of one's heritage. One particularly moving part of the choreopoem is a tribute to Haitian leader Toussaint L'Ouverture.<br />&quot;For colored girls...&quot; is a stunning hybrid of poetry, drama, and feminist theology. It is both tragic and sensuous, with the healing power of ritual. The final scenes contain some of the most powerful words ever written for the theater. If you are interested in African-American literature, women's studies, or 20th century drama, I recommend you read this work.	2001-09-19

Hansberry creates the story of the Youngers, a struggling African-American family whose members deal with poverty, racism, and painful conflict among themselves as they reach for a better life. The Youngers are, in my opinion, one of the most unforgettable families in United States literature. Hansberry balances grim drama, comic moments, and redemptive love as the play unfolds.<br />Although a few of the characters may seem a bit stereotypical, the play strikes me as surprisingly fresh after all these decades. It is also fascinating to hear the voices of three generations of a single family in this play. Ultimately, &quot;Raisin&quot; is a celebration of struggle, pride, and hope, in addition to being a historically important indictment of mid-20th century racism. This is essential reading for anybody with a serious interest in United States drama or African-American literature.	2001-09-17

This volume brings together the work of several generations of Arab-American poets, from Ameen Rihani (1876-1940) to Elmaz Abinader (b. 1954). There are both U.S.-born poets and immigrants.<br />Altogether, 20 poets are represented. The editors include a brief biography of each poet, together with a selection of his or her work. The short bios offer fascinating glimpses into Arab-American literary history. There are both poems originally written in English, as well as English translations of poems that were originally written in Arabic.<br />Some of my favorite poems in this anthology are the following: Kahlil Gibran's romantic &quot;Song of the Wave&quot;; Elia Abu Madi's richly evocative love poem &quot;Holiday Present&quot;; D.H. Melhem's painful &quot;To an Ethiopian Child&quot;; Samuel Hazo's &quot;Some Words for President Wilson,&quot; which reflects on an iconic U.S. leader; H.S. Hamod's &quot;Dying with the Wrong Name,&quot; which deals with Ellis Island and the immigrant experience; and Sharif S. Elmusa's &quot;She Fans the Word,&quot; about the joys and wonders of language. This is just a small sampling of the poems in this book.<br />I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about the various ethnic literatures of the United States (African-American, Native American, Jewish American, etc.) but I must admit that &quot;Grape Leaves&quot; really opened my eyes to an ethnic literature about which I have been quite ignorant. In addition to being a fine collection of poetry, &quot;Grape Leaves&quot; reminds us that Arab Americans have been a part of America for a long time. Hopefully this book will help get some recognition for the cultural contributions of Arab Americans.	2001-09-17

Rather than cover a large number of poets who are represented by just a few poems each, Conarroe decided to focus on six pivotal United States poets and to offer a healthy sampling of some of their most compelling work. Happily, Conarroe succeeds in compiling an excellent volume.<br />The anthology starts off with the lusty humanism of Walt Whitman and the passionate wit of Emily Dickinson, and then presents some of the choicest fruits from the work of four 20th century greats: Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Robert Frost, and Langston Hughes. Along the way are some real masterpieces: Stevens' &quot;Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,&quot; WCW's poem about the &quot;red wheel / barrow,&quot; Frost's &quot;Mending Wall,&quot; Hughes' &quot;Mother to Son,&quot; and many more.<br />As a whole, a wonderful variety of poetic forms and themes are represented. The concise but substantial author bios are another strong point of this volume. This book is a wonderful choice both for classroom use and for general reading. You also might want to check out this book's companion volume, &quot;Eight American Poets,&quot; also edited by Conarroe.	2001-09-17

But &quot;The Harper Single Volume American Literature,&quot; under the general editorship of Donald McQuade, is probable the best overall anthology of its kind. Weighing in at about 3000 pages, this is a huge gathering of American voices. The third edition of this text includes some major changes.<br />The anthology starts out with such foundational texts as Native American myths, an excerpt from an Icelandic saga about the discovery of the New World, and writings of Christopher Columbus. There follows a good sampling of 17th century Colonial literature. From there, the anthology moves chronologically to the contemporary era.<br />There is a great diversity of material here: poetry, autobiography, letters, speeches, short stories, excerpts from novels, plays, political documents, and more. The authors chosen represent the ethnic diversity of the U.S.: there are Asian American, African American, Native American, Jewish, Latino/a, and other voices. There is a good balance of male and female authors, and an interesting representation of lesbian and gay literature (most notably the first part of Tony Kushner's play &quot;Angels in America&quot;). Through it all, most of the great names in U.S. literature appear.<br />There are informative introductions to each of the book's separate sections. Also fascinating are the several &quot;Cultural Portfolios&quot; scattered throughout the book. These are gatherings of texts and (in most cases) images that reflect a focused theme: the Salem witch trials, the Harlem Renaissance, etc. The most interesting of these Cultural Portfolios, in my opinion, is the one entitled &quot;Who Is an American Writer?&quot; This portfolio questions why some writers are &quot;excluded&quot; from the &quot;canon&quot; on the basis of birthplace, citizenship, or language in which they write; the portfolio includes examples of the writings of Vladimir Nabokov, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Maria Irene Fornes, Bharati Mukherjee, and others.<br />As excellent as this anthology is, there are some flaws. There is a virtual exclusion of important science fiction authors. Isaac Asimov, Octavia Butler, Ursula LeGuin, Ray Bradbury, Samuel Delany: neither these nor any of the other great sci-fi writers appear. The neglect of this important genre is lamentable.<br />I also question the inclusion of Mark Twain's &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; in its entirety. This book is a pivotal masterpiece, but it is widely available in a number of inexpensive additions. I would have used the space in the anthology to include a variety of other works by Twain and other authors, and let interested teachers order a copy of &quot;Huckleberry&quot; separately.<br />Despite its flaws, this is a truly outstanding anthology.

There are great science fiction writers. And then there are those extraordinary science fiction writers whose work both transcends and ennobles the genre. Such a writer is Octavia E. Butler, and &quot;Bloodchild and Other Stories&quot; is a stunning testament of her talent and vision. The pieces in this book have garnered two Hugo Awards and one Nebula (very distinguished honors in the SF world).<br />&quot;Bloodchild&quot; contains 5 stories (2 of them on the longer side) as well as two illuminating essays. In addition, Butler provides an afterword for each piece. The best of these stories are true masterpieces. &quot;Bloodchild&quot; is about the strange symbiotic relationship between a colony of humans and a very different alien species. In &quot;The Evening and the Morning and the Night&quot; the author creates a haunting portrait of a human subculture that has evolved as the result of a terrifying new disease. Also outstanding is &quot;Speech Sounds,&quot; about what happens after a mysterious force impairs humanity's ability to communicate with written and spoken language.<br />Butler's essay &quot;Positive Obsession&quot; is an illuminating exploration of her distinctive life as a African-American woman who is also a successful SF writer.<br />Butler's writing style has a stark, painful clarity to it. She writes scenes of horror and despair, but also includes moments of tenderness and hope. Through it all, her stories are rich with insights into the universal human condition.

The play takes place in New York City and on Chris's barge.<br />&quot;Anna Christie&quot; is a compelling study of gender roles and expectations, ethnic conflict in the U.S., family ties and disruptions, the call of the seafaring life, and fatalism versus the embrace of free will. Particularly interesting is O'Neill's representation of various types of vernacular speech. Overall, a classic American play that deserves an ongoing reading audience.	2001-09-09

The protagonist, Sammy, is a gay, Colombian-born poet who lives in New York City (where the novel mainly takes place). The novel is full of colorful, engaging characters (such as a midget hooker named Hot Sauce and a parrot named Simon Bolivar). The novel follows Sammy as he spends time with his family, with the Colombian community in NYC, at his stressful job as an interpreter, and with his circle of friends and neighbors.<br />Manrique expertly blends comedy and tragedy, as well as realism and humorous absurdism, in this story. Although the novel is full of appealing silly moments, Manrique also deals with many serious topics, such as ethnic/national identity, literary politics, AIDS, and anti-gay prejudice. He treats his characters with insight and compassion. And throughout, the novel is enriched with the spicy tastes of Latin American food and the rhythms of Latin music. Also adding to the rich flavor of &quot;Latin Moon&quot; are the many cultural references (both pop culture and &quot;high&quot; culture) that are woven into the dialogue and narration.<br />&quot;Latin Moon&quot; is at times wildly outrageous. The first chapter, for example, ends with one of the most hilarious, explicit, taboo-busting sex scenes that I have ever encountered in literature. But such over-the-top elements are just part of a book with a tender heart and a keen intelligence. Also recommended: the same author's nonfiction prose work &quot;Eminent Maricones,&quot; and his poetry collection &quot;My Night With Federico Garcia Lorca.&quot;	2001-09-05

The editor herself is well-known as a master writer of short stories, so you know that she has insights into the genre.<br />This is a truly sweeping anthology. The authors (56 altogether) range chronologically from Washington Irving (1783-1859) to Pinckney Benedict (b. 1964). Many of the &quot;giants&quot; of U.S. literature, among them a number of Nobel and Pulitzer recipients, are included: Herman Melville (&quot;The Paradise of Bachelors...&quot;), Edgar Allan Poe (&quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;), Edith Wharton (&quot;A Journey&quot;), Saul Bellow (Something to Remember Me By&quot;), etc.<br />In her introduction, Oates notes that one of her goals in this anthology was to present &quot;[f]amiliar names, unfamiliar titles.&quot; Thus, it is rewarding to see stories like &quot;Cannibalism in the Cars,&quot; by Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain). But she does, in some cases, include an author's best-known story (like Charlotte Perkins Gilman's &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;). A good balance overall.<br />Oates also includes many authors who represent ethnic currents in U.S. literature: African-American, Jewish, Native American, Latina, and Asian-American. There are also a number of &quot;regional&quot; writers.<br />There is a wide variety of themes and stylistic approaches represented in this book. I was particularly interested in those stories that represent various forms of American vernacular speech: Jean Toomer's &quot;Blood-Burning Moon,&quot; Eudora Welty's &quot;Where Is That Voice Coming From?&quot;, etc. I was also pleased at the inclusion of one of Ray Bradbury's masterful science fiction tales (the haunting &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot;).<br />Obviously, an anthology of this nature will not please everybody perfectly; I'm sure many readers will name favorite stories and authors whom they would have liked to have seen included in this collection. Personally, I would have added a story each by Alice Walker, Hisaye Yamamoto, Samuel Delany, H.P. Lovecraft, and Octavia Butler. But overall, this is a fine anthology, good both for classroom use and individual recreational reading.ection.

Hers is, despite the centuries that separate us from her, a very engaging and meaningful poetic voice.<br />Many of the poems in this volume are about her family members, and about the joys and sorrows of family life. Bradstreet writes with great warmth and sensitivity about her husband, children, parents, grandchildren, and daughter-in-law. Her poem &quot;To my Dear and loving Husband&quot; is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful love poems ever written. Overall, her family-related poems give real insight into the struggles faced by women of her era, but these poems also have a universality that transcends her time.<br />There is a lot of other good stuff in this volume. Bradstreet's voice is often quite witty (especially in &quot;The Author to her Book&quot;). &quot;The Prologue&quot; is a fascinating proto-feminist defense of female literary aspiration. Also fascinating is her tribute to England's Queen Elizabeth I. Bradstreet's poetry is essential for scholars of American literature. But her work should be read not just for scholarship, but also for the real humanity and artistry of her voice.	2001-09-04

Sherman has packed a lot into just 82 pages. Many of the giant names of African-American literature are here: Phillis Wheatley, Frances E.W. Harper, James Weldon Johnson, Paul Laurence Dunbar, and many more. There are also poets who are perhaps less well-known, but still admirable as literary creators. As a whole, these poets write with an intriguing variety of voices: solemn, satirical, militant, etc.<br />Many of black America's most important and most memorable poems are in here: Wheatley's &quot;On Being Brought from Africa to America,&quot; Dunbar's &quot;Sympathy&quot; (with its significant line, &quot;I know why the caged bird sings...&quot;), and Countee Cullen's &quot;Yet Do I Marvel.&quot; There are poems about slavery, literacy, religion, racial uplift, folk culture, and more. It is interesting to see the juxtaposition (sometimes from the same author) between poems written in vernacular language and those written in very formal English with classical references.<br />The only weak aspect of the book are the author bios. They are simply too short. Some are only a single sentence long, and they don't contain much bibliographic data. I would have liked a little more for each author. Still, this is an excellent anthology whose compact size and focus make it great both for classroom use and for general reading.	2001-09-04

Heffner, is an excellent anthology of historic texts. The<br />first edition of this essential book appeared in 1952, and new and<br />enlarged editions have gradually appeared over the decades. The texts<br />in this book include many key documents that have shaped United States<br />history.<br /><br /> There is an emphasis on political and legal documents: the<br />Declaration of Independence, several key Supreme Court decisions,<br />Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, Clinton's 1998 State of the Union<br />Address, and much more. There are also many texts from<br />non-governmental individuals and bodies: the first issue of the<br />anti-slavery periodical &quot;The Liberator,&quot; William Faulkner's<br />1949 Nobel Prize acceptance speech, the 1966 Statement of Purpose of<br />the National Organization for Women, and much more.<br /><br /> As I said, this<br />book has &quot;grown&quot; considerably over the decades. A<br />particularly impressive enlargement marks the 6th edition, which adds<br />100 pages of new documents. Among these new additions are Booker<br />T. Washington's Atlanta Exposition Address, the Articles of<br />Impeachment against Richard M. Nixon, and the 1994 Republican<br />&quot;Contract with America.&quot;<br /><br /> The book as the whole is more than<br />just a collection of documents. Rather, it feels like fragments from a<br />great epic story: the story of the United States. In this book you see<br />this nation and its citizens in all of our weakness and our strength,<br />our foolishness and our wisdom. We see the struggles to deal as a<br />nation with slavery, war, women's rights, economic injustice, and<br />other controversial issues. And we see the development of a United<br />States &quot;tradition,&quot; a heritage of pivotal documents which<br />sometimes comment on earlier documents.<br /><br /> Yes, I'm sure most readers<br />could name worthy texts that they feel should have been included in<br />this book; maybe some of them will appear in future editions.

The two parts of the<br />play (subtitled &quot;Millennium Approaches&quot; and<br />&quot;Perestroika&quot;) together represent a passionate and<br />intelligent exploration of American life during the era of President<br />Ronald Reagan. Kushner peoples his play with individuals who are for<br />the most part &quot;marginal&quot; in some way in U.S. culture. His<br />characters include Mormons, gay men, men with AIDS, Jews, a drug<br />addict, and an African-American drag queen. These various perspectives<br />and voices allow Kushner to create some fascinating dialogues about<br />the &quot;American dream&quot;--and about the nightmares that can go<br />along with it.<br /><br /> Kushner's cast of characters is excellently drawn, but<br />perhaps his most astounding creation is influential lawyer Roy Cohn, a<br />fictionalized version of a real historical figure. A gay Jew who is<br />himself viciously homophobic, Kushner's Cohn is grotesque, hilarious,<br />frightening, and seductive all at once. This character allows Kushner<br />to make fascinating statements about power, politics, and sexual<br />identity.<br /><br /> Also brilliant is Kushner's use of Mormonism and its<br />theology as an integral component of the play. Kushner is the first<br />literary artist I know of who has used Mormon themes and motifs in<br />such a consistently compelling and intelligent way. Kushner is, in my<br />opinion, neither a proselytizer for nor a basher of Mormonism, but his<br />presentation of troubled Mormon characters and his apparent satirizing<br />of some aspects of Mormon theology both strike me as potentially<br />controversial. Because Mormonism is a religion founded in the U.S.,<br />this aspect of Kushner's play accentuates the essential<br />&quot;American-ness&quot; of the piece.<br /><br /> Kushner achieves a stunning<br />blend of politically charged realism and fantastic, even playful<br />mysticism in &quot;Angels.&quot; His writing is sharp and cutting at<br />times, and elsewhere tender and haunting. And the play is often quite<br />funny. Although the action of the play focuses on the Reagan era,<br />&quot;Angels&quot; often takes in a much larger sweep of U.S., and<br />even world, history.<br /><br /> &quot;Angels in America&quot; is a fascinating<br />meditation on power and its abuse, on disease and healing, on honesty<br />to oneself and to others, and on pluralism and bigotry. A masterpiece<br />of 20th century literature, this is a play to be seen. But whether or<br />not you have seen it, it is also a work to be read and pondered.charged realism and fantastic, even playful<br />mysticism in &quot;Angels.&quot; His writing is sharp and cutting at<br />times, and elsewhere tender and haunting.

The book gathers a range of pieces in many genres by more<br />than 30 authors. The authors represented are a diverse group. There is<br />a good balance of male and female writers. The authors represent both<br />United States-born individuals and immigrants. One author, Frank Chin,<br />is a fifth-generation Chinese American. Other authors trace their<br />roots to Japan, India, China, Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines,<br />Indonesia, Malaysia, or Laos. Some represent biracial<br />backgrounds. Several generations of writers, from Sui Sin Far<br />(1867-1914) to Monique Thuy-Dung Truong (b. 1968) are<br />represented.<br /><br /> Several genres of literature are also represented. The<br />selections in the anthology are grouped into four sections: nonfiction<br />prose, fiction, poetry, and drama. Each author's contribution is<br />preceded by an interesting individual introduction which contains<br />useful bibliographic data; this material is further supplemented by a<br />bibliography at the end of the book. Editor Wong also includes a<br />fascinating preface to the whole book. This supplemental material is<br />full of interesting information, such as the story of Wong's<br />rediscovery of pioneering Japanese American writer Toshio Mori.<br /><br /> There<br />are many highlights to this fine anthology: Amy Tan's essay<br />&quot;Mother Tongue,&quot; in which she reflects on &quot;the<br />different Englishes&quot; she uses; Bienvenido Santos' &quot;Quicker<br />with Arrows,&quot; a story of interracial love during World War II;<br />Bharati Mukherjee's &quot;The Management of Grief,&quot; a story about<br />the aftermath of an apparent terrorist bombing; Lawson Fusao Inada's<br />&quot;Legends from Camp,&quot; a cycle of poems about the internment<br />of Japanese Americans in U.S. concentration camps during World War II;<br />Watako Yamauchi's &quot;The Music Lessons,&quot; a play about the<br />struggles of a Japanese American family during the Depression of the<br />1930s; and much more.<br /><br /> I did find a small number of typographical<br />errors or apparent factual mistakes throughout the book; for example,<br />at one point Frank Chin's novel &quot;Donald Duk&quot; seems to be<br />mistakenly referred to as &quot;Donald Pink&quot; (I know of no novel<br />by the latter name). And the concluding bibliography, while useful, is<br />confusingly presented. But these problems aside, I found &quot;Asian<br />American Literature&quot; to be an enriching anthology.

The author, Normee Ekoomiak, is one of the Inuit people of northern Quebec. This book contains full-color reproductions of Ekoomiak's paintings and stitched fabric creations. Each piece of visual art is accompanied by an explanatory mini-essay by the artist.<br />Ekoomiak's vivid art depicts the Inuit people, the natural environment, and the animal life of the Arctic. We see a family in the iglu, polar bears, children playing various games, a family ice fishing, a flock of geese flying, and more. Although most of the artwork is in a fairly realistic mode, there are also some stunning stylized depictions of figures from Inuit folk traditions. One such marvelous piece, for example, depicts a tusked narwhal surrounded by mermaids. An important recurring motif is Okpik, the spirit owl &quot;who sees everything.&quot;<br />The book is presented in a bilingual format: the text appears in both English and Inuktitut (the Inuit language). Inuktitut is written with a striking, almost mathematical-looking type of script which is similar to that used in the Cree language. This appearance of two very different scripts alongside Ekoomiak's fine artwork really enhances the visual appeal of the book. All in all, an excellent book for readers of all ages.	2001-08-23

And Here My Troubles Began	Books	5	167	181	N	N	&quot;Maus&quot;: an important literary landmark	Art Spiegelman's &quot;Maus: A Survivor's Tale&quot; is a unique and unforgettable work of literature. This two-volume set of book-length comics (or &quot;graphic novels,&quot; if you prefer) tells the story of the narrator, Artie, and his father Vladek, a Holocaust survivor. &quot;Maus&quot; is thus an important example of both Holocaust literature and of the graphic novel. The two volumes of &quot;Maus&quot; are subtitled &quot;My Father Bleeds History&quot; and &quot;And Here My Troubles Began&quot;; they should be read together to get the biggest impact.<br />Artie is a comic book artist who is trying to create art that is meaningful, not just commercial. As the two volumes of &quot;Maus&quot; unfold, he gradually learns the full story of his father's history as a Jewish survivor of the World War II Holocaust. There is a complex &quot;book within the book&quot; motif, since the main character is actually writing the book that we are reading. This self-referentiality also allows Spiegelman to get in some satiric material.<br />The distinguishing conceit of &quot;Maus&quot; involves depicting the books' humanoid characters as having animal heads. All the Jews have mice heads, the Germans are cats, the Americans dogs, etc. It is a visually provocative device, although not without problematic aspects. To his credit, Spiegelman addresses some of the ambiguities of this visual device in the course of the 2 volumes. For example, Artie's wife, a Frenchwoman who converted to Judaism, wonders what kind of animal head she should have in the comic.<br />&quot;Maus&quot; contains some stunning visual touches, as well as some truly painful and thought-provoking dialogue. Vladek is one of the most extraordinary characters in 20th century literature. As grim as the two books' subject matter is, there are some moments of humor and warmth. Overall, &quot;Maus&quot; is a profound reflection on family ties, history, memory, and the role of the artist in society.	2001-08-21

These stories date from the 1830s and 1840s, and reveal Hawthorne, well-known today as a novelist, to be a talented practitioner of the short story genre.<br />These are stories of weird science, romantic and professional obsession, thwarted love, witchcraft, guilt, and the quest for beauty. Irony and tragedy mark many of the tales. Hawthorne takes us from the rugged American frontier to a sunlit Italian garden. The title story is a strangely compelling evocation of the Salem Puritans and their obsession with Satanic conspiracies. Also impressive is &quot;Roger Malvin's Burial,&quot; a devastating psychological tale.<br />If the only Hawthorne you know is the author of the justly-celebrated &quot;Scarlet Letter,&quot; check out this collection. Overall, this book is a good choice both for classroom use and individual reading.	2001-08-19

This 19th century work is more than just a poetic masterpiece; it is a pivotal landmark in the history of world literature. Read &quot;Leaves&quot; and you will understand why Whitman is hailed as a poetic ancestor by poets, both male and female, of many different ethnic and national backgrounds. His is truly a universal voice.<br />Whitman published the first edition of &quot;Leaves&quot; in 1855, and continued to revise and expand the book until it had grown into the monumental final version. While the &quot;deathbed&quot; edition is an essential text, I'd like to put in a plug for the much smaller 1855 edition, which has been reprinted with an introduction by Malcolm Cowley. The &quot;deathbed&quot; edition may be too large and intimidating a literary tapestry for Whitman &quot;virgins&quot;; the reprinted 1855 edition may thus be a good way to begin exploring the bounteous poetic talent and vision of this giant.<br />The Cowley-introduced edition also includes Whitman's original prose introduction, which is itself a remarkable piece of literature. While the 1855 &quot;Leaves&quot; is missing vast sections of the deathbed version, it is still a stunning work of art that succeeds as a self-sufficient piece of literature and philosophy. In this &quot;embryonic&quot; version of the soon-to-evolve masterpiece, we already discover Whitman's pungent eroticism, his embrace of paradox, and his playful theological exploration. His language is sensuous, outrageous, tender, and amazing, and is full of compassion for all living beings.<br />Whitman is more than just a great poet; his work is a sort of prophecy for both the secular and multifaith worlds. So read &quot;Leaves&quot; in either the embryonic version or the ultimate version, and embark on an unforgettable poetic journey.	2001-08-19

The book follows a group of fossil hunters on a quest in which they discover fossilized dinosaur eggs. The text also goes back in time to depict the lives of dinosaurs, and to show how their eggs became fossilized.<br />Dussling's easy-to-read text is nicely complemented by Pamela Johnson's illustrations. Although I found Johnson's dinosaurs to be a little too &quot;cartoony&quot; looking at times, her illustrations are generally effective, and make good use of a lot of soothing earth tones. Overall, a good choice for young readers with an interest in dinosaurs.	2001-08-19

Throughout the story his waffling is accompanied by a sort of silent chorus of multicolored faces.<br />The artwork in &quot;Waffle&quot; is surreal. Waffle himself is a sort of amorphous humanoid figure who appears to have been drawn with a deliberate crudeness. I have to admit, I found the artistic technique quite weird, but I give Raschke credit for trying a different approach to children's book illustration. And the book's message--about believing in your own abilities--is a good one.	2001-08-17

Each poem celebrates mothers and/or grandmothers. The poems are accompanied by the wonderful illustrations of Ecuador native Paula S. Barragan M.<br />These poems celebrate relationships, food, bilingualism, and family history. Some of my favorite selections include Cristina Muniz Mutchler's &quot;Mi abuela&quot; (&quot;Many grandmothers like to bake cookies and cakes / mi abuela likes to make tortillas y empenadas&quot;), Rane Arroyo's &quot;My Tongue is Like a Map&quot; (&quot;Sometimes I dream in English and Spanish&quot;), and Mimi Chapra's &quot;Mi mama cubana&quot; (&quot;When mi mama cubana cooks arroz con pollo, / her smile is wider than a slice of watermelon&quot;). Many other authors are featured, including Judith Ortiz Cofer and Francisco X. Alarcon.<br />This book is an excellent tribute to both Latino cultures and to mothers and grandmothers. Barragan's richly colored illustrations crackle with energy, and can also be very tender. Highly recommended to anyone with fond memories of a mother and/or grandmother, regardless of the reader's own cultural heritage.	2001-08-17

Translator William Gates has also provided some illuminating notes to the text. De Landa was a clergyman who was instrumental in suppressing the indigenous Mayan culture of Yucatan. In his introduction, Gates notes ironically that de Landa &quot;burned ninety-nine times as much knowledge of Maya history and sciences as he has given us in his book.&quot; Also ironically, de Landa wrote the book as a matter of self-justification after his forced return to Spain.<br />So de Landa's work must be read with a very critical eye. Still, this is a frequently fascinating account of Native American life at the time of the Spanish conquest. De Landa describes Indian architecture, clothing, culinary arts, and musical instruments. He also describes the bounteous plant and animal life of the region (particularly interesting is his account of the manatees). De Landa also describes the &quot;Europeanization&quot; of the younger Indian generation, and explains why he destroyed priceless native texts.<br />This edition contains some supplemental documents implicating de Landa as the &quot;chief author&quot; of many of the abuses heaped upon the Indians by their Spanish conquerors. This book is an important resource, but it is also a chilling record of cultural imperialism, religious chauvinism, and personal arrogance.	2001-08-15

The book, which has been translated into English by Gregory Rabassa, is the multigenerational saga of the Buendia family and the town of Macondo. Garcia Marquez narrates decades of love, death, war, socio-economic activism, incest, and politics in the lives of a large cast of characters.<br />I must admit, I didn't find &quot;100 Years&quot; to be as satisfying or as engaging as some of GGM's other works (in particular, the gripping &quot;Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor&quot; and the wonderful &quot;Of Love and Other Demons,&quot; both of which I recommend with great enthusiasm). I think &quot;100 Years&quot; is in some ways comparable to &quot;Paradiso,&quot; by Cuba's Jose Lezama Lima: I found both to be ambitious &quot;meganovels&quot; which, despite their many good points, were lacking in some way.<br />But &quot;100 Years&quot; is well worth reading. The novel has many powerful and haunting scenes, and throughout is graced by touches of magic. There are many intriguing, and often tragic, characters: the gypsy Melquiades, the dirt-eating Rebeca, the matriarch Ursula, the seventeen Aurelianos, and the butterfly-heralded Mauricio Babilonia. An essential book for those with a serious interest in Latin American literature.	2001-08-15

Books	5	41	52	N	N	A classic parable of social justice	Like many of Dr. Seuss' great classics, &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; can be read on multiple levels. You could approach it as a straightforward story (which is, I'm sure, how most children enjoy it). Or you could read the plot and characters as metaphors for larger issues. Either way, &quot;Horton&quot; is an unforgettable text.<br />&quot;Horton&quot; opens with the delightful rhyme &quot;On the fifteenth of May, in the Jungle of Nool, / In the heat of the day, in the cool of the pool.&quot;  Horton, a kind-hearted elephant, is the only inhabitant of the jungle who is capable of hearing the Whos, a microscopic race of beings whose entire civilization exists on a speck of dust. Mocked and abused by those who refuse to believe in the tiny Whos, Horton must ultimately join the Whos in a bold plan to prove the tiny beings' existence, and thus save their civilization from destruction.<br />Dr. Seuss brilliantly combines the classic animal fable genre with a brilliant science fiction twist. But I also see &quot;Horton&quot; as a deeply humanistic parable of social justice. The Whos could be seen as symbols for any group of individuals who have been rendered &quot;invisible&quot; and voiceless by an arrogant dominant group. So the Whos could represent the poor, the lesbian and gay community, ethnic or religious minorities, women, or other groups.<br />And Horton could be seen as a courageous, nonconformist prophet of social justice--a sort of Seussian version of Pablo Neruda, or Walt Whitman. Moreover, Horton is a member of the &quot;dominant&quot; group who chooses to identify with and stand in solidarity with a marginalized community, even at the risk of his own freedom. Furthermore, the hoped-for salvation of the Whos lies not in Horton's actions alone, nor in the Whos' own actions alone, but rather in the combined strength of both the entire Who community and their elephant advocate. I believe that Horton's quest reflects the ideas expressed by Brazilian educator-philosopher Paulo Freire in his classic volume &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed.&quot;<br />I don't want to reveal the details of the book's ending, but I'll just say that Dr. Seuss brings this suspenseful tale to a triumphant and life-affirming conclusion. And the story is brilliantly enhanced by marvelous Seussian artwork--I especially liked the illustrations of the whimsical Whos and their Escheresque city. &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; is a classic for readers of all ages.hilosopher Paulo Freire in his classic volume &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed.&quot;<br />I don't want to reveal the details of the book's ending, but I'll just say that Dr. Seuss brings this suspenseful tale to a triumphant and life-affirming conclusion.

Honey notes that these poems span the years 1918 to 1931. Each poem is accompanied with its original publication data.<br />Represented in this anthology are such important African-American women authors as Georgia Douglas Johnson, Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Angelina Weld Grimke, and Helene Johnson. In addition, there appear many authors whose names may even be unknown to specialists in the field of Black women's literature: Esther Popel, Marjorie Marshall, Isabel Neill, and more. Where data is available, Honey provides brief author bios at the end of the book. She also contributes a substantial introduction.<br />The poems are grouped into four sections: &quot;Protest,&quot; &quot;Heritage,&quot; &quot;Love and Passion,&quot; and &quot;Nature.&quot; I must admit, I didn't particularly care for this breakdown. Because the works of individual poets are scattered among two or more sections, I think this editorial strategy dilutes the possible impact of seeing a larger sampling of a single poet's work in one place. Also, the headings seem to impose a particular, limited reading upon each piece.<br />Still, this is an impressive anthology. The poems range from formal constructions to free verse. Highlights include Georgia Douglass Johnson's passionate pieces &quot;The Heart of a Woman&quot; and &quot;I Want to Die While You Love Me,&quot; Dorothea Matthew's solemn &quot;The Lynching,&quot; Anita Scott Coleman's sentimental &quot;Black Baby,&quot; and Angelina Weld Grimke's haiku-like &quot;Dawn.&quot; Particularly impressive are the technical proficiency and linguistic richness of Helene Johnson's poems. &quot;Shadowed Dreams&quot; is an essential volume for those interested in United States literature of the 1920s, African-American studies, and women's studies.	2001-08-14

And &quot;Great Short Works of Edgar Allan Poe,&quot; edited by G.R. Thompson, is a solid sampling of some of Poe's most marvelous literary achievements. The editor's selection allows the reader to experience the many different facets of this genius: Poe as poet, as critic, as mystery writer, as science fiction pioneer, as satirist, and, of course, as seminal master of horror.<br />Of course, no selective presentation of Poe will please everybody. I'm sure that most Poe enthusiasts will bemoan the absence of a favorite piece from this collection. Personally, I missed &quot;The Gold-Bug,&quot; one of the stories that most impacted me as a young reader many years ago. But Thompson has packed a diverse cross-section of great material into a fairly compact space. You'll find such essential triumphs as &quot;the Raven,&quot; &quot;The Masque of the Red Death,&quot; and &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue.&quot;<br />This edition includes both a good bibliography and a chronology of Poe's life. &quot;Great Short Works&quot; is a good resource for both the general reader and for classroom use.	2001-08-14

Stephanie Spinner's simple text (geared towards 1st to 3rd grade readers) is well complemented by Susan Swan's fine illustrations. Author Spinner thoughtfully provides pronunciation guides for the mythological names.<br />&quot;Snake Hair&quot; tells how the beautiful Medusa is punished for her boastful pride by being transformed into a monster with snakes for hair and a face so ugly that anyone who looks at it is turned into stone. As the story progresses, the monstrous Medusa is confronted by the hero Perseus (who will face yet another monster before the story ends).<br />What makes this version of the ancient story really special is the marvelous artwork. Swan's illustrations appear to be cut-paper collages, and they are alive with color and energy. Particularly impressive are her renderings of the multicolored tangle of serpents that make up Medusa's hair. Overall, a well-done book.	2001-08-13

Although the Cafe's name indicates its origins in the Nuyorican (New York Puerto Rican) experience, the Cafe has evolved to include people of all ethnicities (as does this anthology). In addition to featuring Puerto Rican, Nicaraguan, and Cuban artists, the anthology also features the work of individuals who chronicle the African-American, Chinese-American, and lesbian/gay experience.<br />This is an exciting anthology. The pieces in the book are grouped into several sections: &quot;Inner City Tragedy and Politics,&quot; &quot;Gender Plays,&quot; &quot;Hip Hop and Rap,&quot; &quot;Monologues and Performance Pieces,&quot; &quot;Comedy and Satire,&quot; and &quot;Musical Epics.&quot; The authors represented include both well-known names in literature (Amiri Baraka, Miguel Pinero, Ntozake Shange, etc.) as well as many names that were new to me (Gloria Feliciano, Eva Gasteazoro, etc.).<br />There are some real standouts in this strong collection. I loved Ishmael Reed's &quot;Savage Wilds,&quot; an outrageously funny satire of TV, politics, and criminal justice. Ntozake Shange's &quot;I Live in Music&quot; is a powerful, painful piece that can be seen as a companion/sequel to her classic &quot;for colored girls. . . .&quot; Miguel Pinero's &quot;Playland Blues&quot; is a gritty, naturalistic exploration of underaged prostitution, sexual orientation issues, violence, and the quest for real love. But the piece that impressed me the most was probably Alvin Eng's &quot;The Goong Hay Kid,&quot; a superb play about a Chinese-American &quot;punk-rapper and performance artist&quot; who tries to maintain his artistic integrity in a world of consumeristic ethno-exploitation. &quot;Action&quot; is essential reading for those interested in multicultural studies, the urban experience, and innovative theater.is essential reading for those interested in multicultural studies, the urban experience, and innovative theater.	2001-08-13

The book has been translated from Spanish into English by Helen Lane.<br />In this extended multi-part essay, Paz considers the presence of love, eroticism, and related phenomena in literary works that span many cultures and centuries: the biblical Song of Songs, the writings of the Marquis de Sade, Joyce's &quot;Ulysses,&quot; Murasaki Shikubu's &quot;Tale of Genji,&quot; Mohammed Ibn Dawud's &quot;Book of the Flower,&quot; the poems of Sappho, and much more. Paz also considers a wide range of other social and scientific phenomena that are relevant to his project: the &quot;Big Bang&quot; theory, the AIDS crisis, artificial intelligence, the Buddhist concept of Nirvana, the &quot;Luciferian&quot; movement in art, and more.<br />Occasionally, Paz seems to be a little too full of himself; he sometimes issues pronouncements on highly debatable points as if they were undebatable facts. But his overall passion and intelligence make these occasional lapses forgivable.<br />&quot;The Double Flame&quot; is also rich in what I call &quot;Pazisms&quot;: characteristically witty, wise, and highly quotable statements. Here's one of my favorite Pazisms: &quot;Love has been and is still the great act of subversion in the West&quot; (from the 5th chapter, &quot;A Solar System&quot;). If you are interested in love and eroticism, in the art of nonfiction prose, or in Latin American literature, check out this book.	2001-08-13

This book brings together a wide range of texts, each of which was originally written in a language other than English: Italian, Chinese, Russian, Danish, Yiddish, Navajo, Greek, and more. For the most part, the selections are presented in their original language, with the English translation on the facing page of each two-page spread.<br />In his introduction, Sollors notes that the purpose of this anthology is &quot;to make visible the most glaring blind spot in American letters.&quot; The editors, in my opinion, succeed in this goal. This is a richly diverse gathering: autobiography, myth, short stories, poetry, humor, history, sermons, and more are included. The texts span several centuries, from the colonial era to the 1990s. Each selection includes its own separate introduction. Along the way are many fascinating facts--did you know, for example, that more than 50 Welsh-language periodicals circulated in America during the 19th century?<br />Some of the selections that intrigued me the most were Omar Ibn Said's 1831 Arabic slave narrative (which also raises interesting questions about religious pluralism in the United States); the Walum Olum of the Lenape, a Native American creation myth accompanied by fascinating pictographs; and &quot;The Tyrolean&quot; (1897), Julian Czupka's humorous story of Polish immigrants.<br />&quot;The Multilingual Anthology&quot; is a book that truly opens windows onto little-appreciated aspects of United States culture. I also recommend Reinaldo Arenas' novel &quot;The Doorman,&quot; written in Spanish by this Cuban exile to the United States.	2001-07-24

The poems have been translated into English by Diana P. Decker. The poems are presented in a bilingual format, with the Spanish originals and English versions on facing pages.<br />The book includes an introduction by Peri Rossi, who explains that &quot;Evohe&quot; is a word of Greek origin: &quot;the call to the bacchanalia.&quot; She also notes that the book &quot;provoked a considerable scandal&quot; when it was first published in 1971 in Uruguay, and was later banned.<br />The speaker in &quot;Evohe&quot; declares her erotic love for women. The book opens with a quote from Sappho, thus reinforcing the lesbian feel of the poetry. Many of the poems in &quot;Evohe&quot; are metaphysical and mysterious in tone. At times the book reads like some strange Gnostic scripture. The poet of whose work this book most reminds me is United States author Stephen Crane.<br />&quot;Evohe&quot; explores the relationship s between words and women, and between language and sexual love. Part of the book is a remarkable retelling of the biblical story of Adam and Eve. Several stunning poems merge religious and sexual imagery.<br />Peri Rossi writes, &quot;Women are words of an ancient and forgotten / tongue.&quot; &quot;Evohe&quot; reveals that ancient tongue to the contemporary world with remarkable grace and sensuality. I recommend this book, especially to those with an interest in women's studies, Latin American literature, or Spanish-language poetry.

The book is a merciless of expose of Mother Teresa, the Roman Catholic nun who has been internationally hailed for her work with the poor. But Hitchens claims that there is a dark side to this seemingly saintly figure, whom he calls &quot;a religious fundamentalist, a political operative, a primitive sermonizer and an accomplice of worldly powers.&quot; With his grimly intelligent prose, Hitchens does a good job of supporting this assessment.<br />Hitchens looks at Teresa's involvement with such unsavory figures as the corrupt Duvalier regime of Haiti. He analyzes the international &quot;cult&quot; of Teresa, and considers the political alliances she formed. He also takes a critical look at the hospices operated by her order, noting that the &quot;point&quot; of these institutions &quot;is not the honest relief of suffering but the promulgation of a cult based on death and suffering and subjection.&quot; Hitchens also considers Teresa's role as an international tool of the Roman Catholic hierarchy.<br />Perhaps the most damning section of the book is the sordid tale of Teresa's involvement with Charles Keating, who was convicted in the Savings and Loan scandal of the 1990s. This part of the book includes a photocopy of a remarkable letter signed by Teresa on behalf of Keating.<br />Hitchens' remarkable book reminds us that no public figure should be considered so &quot;saintly&quot; as to be above scrutiny. He also reminds us that it is often useful to analyze the political and ideological motives behind certain &quot;charitable&quot; enterprises. &quot;The Missionary Position&quot; is a well-written and thought-provoking analysis of the shadowy intersections of politics, religious dogma, and popular culture.	2001-07-24

Quiroga (1878-1937) was born in Uruguay and ended his life in Argentina. The stories have been translated into English by Margaret Sayers Peden.<br />These are stories of death, violence, horror, adventure, talking animals, and magical transformation. There are a number of grotesque flourishes, especially in the disturbing title story. As a storyteller, Quiroga is comparable to Edgar Allan Poe of the U.S., although I believe his nearest Latin American soulmate is Virgilio Pinera of Cuba.<br />Some of the best tales in this collection include with the already mentioned title story; &quot;Juan Darien,&quot; a magical story which begins &quot;Herein is the tale of a tiger who was raised and educated among men. . .&quot;; and &quot;The Incense Tree Roof,&quot; an ironic tale about a beleaguered civil servant.

A sorcerer summoning a demon, a scuba diver facing a sea monster, and of course, voluptuous maidens will be found in this book. In some cases, alternate versions of the same commission are given (making this book especially useful for art students and cultural historians). I recommend this book to those interested in the visual art of the sci-fi, fantasy, and adventure genres.	2001-07-23

This is a bilingual edition, with the Spanish originals and English versions on facing pages. The translation into English is by Manuel A. Tellechea. Tellechea also contributes an excellent introduction which includes fascinating biographical information about Marti. The poems are untitled; each is assigned a Roman numeral.<br />Marti writes about romance, nature, family, and other subjects. Many of his poems are political and revolutionary in nature: he condemns Spanish colonial violence in Cuba, expresses his anti-slavery position, and identifies with the oppressed: &quot;With the earth's poor everywhere, / I shall cast my lot&quot; (poem III). In his marriage of poetry with politics and social justice, Marti foreshadows many of Latin America's 20th century poets: Gioconda Belli of Nicaragua, Roberto Sosa of Honduras, Juan Gelman of Argentina, and others, especially especially Pablo Neruda of Chile.<br />Many of Marti's poems appear to be autobiographical in nature. Some of his poems are dark and macabre in tone, others prophetic and even ecstatic. He sometimes reflects on his own poetic work: &quot;My verse is like a dagger / At whose hilt a flower grows&quot; (poem V). His best work, as interpreted by Tellechea, has a compelling freshness and beauty.<br />I only found one aspect of the book troublesome. Most of Marti's poems are written in four line stanzas, and in each poem he generally sticks to a constant rhyme scheme from stanza to stanza: ABBA or ABAB. But in his English versions, Tellechea sometimes mixes up the ABBA and ABAB schemes within poems, without any logical pattern and contradictory to Marti's originals; I found these switches very distracting.<br />Still, this is an excellent volume by a significant figure in Latin American literary history. And the rhyme scheme issue aside, I commend and thank Tellechea for making these &quot;Simple Verses&quot; available in English.e, I commend and thank Tellechea for making these &quot;Simple Verses&quot; available in English.	2001-07-23

The poems have been translated into English by Richard Schaaf. This volume includes a brief but informative biography of Dalton (1935-75), a Communist and a guerrilla who endured imprisonment and exile, and was eventually assassinated. In his relatively short and turbulent life, Dalton brought forth an impressive poetic legacy.<br />In &quot;Poems,&quot; Dalton (as interpreted by Schaaf) writes with clarity and directness. His voice demonstrates wit, a piercing satiric edge, and flashes of dark, bitter humor. And there are also moments of transcendent hope. Dalton writes about imprisonment, revolution, the poor, and oppressive violence. He satirizes religion and abusive governments. He often extols Communist values. A number of poems are self-reflective examinations of poetry itself.<br />Some of the most notable selections in &quot;Poems&quot; are &quot;Looking for Trouble,&quot; a subversively funny narrative poem about joining a Marxist-Leninist cell; &quot;Poeticus Eficacciae,&quot; a meditation on the relationship between politics and poetry; and &quot;The Bible Business,&quot; which critiques the hypocrisy of North American churches.<br />In &quot;Like You,&quot; Dalton writes, &quot;I believe the world is beautiful, / that poetry is, like bread, for everyone.&quot; Roque Dalton's poetic vision oscillates between hope and horror, but his voice rarely falters. I strongly recommend this book to those interested in Latin American history, politics and poetry.	2001-07-22

Neruda's attentive poetic eye looks at both humanity and nature with reverence and compassion. His voice is often very tender. Like Whitman did in his work, Neruda often writes in the first person in this book.<br />Some of the most memorable selections in this book include &quot;To Don Asterio Alarcon, Clocksmith of Valparaiso,&quot; in which Neruda finds dignity and transcendence in the work of the title figure; &quot;Thistle,&quot; in which he celebrates &quot;the blue thistle of Chile&quot;; and &quot;The People,&quot; a passionate tribute to all the working people of the world.<br />In &quot;Summary,&quot; Neruda writes, &quot;. . . my life was always / singing its way between joy and obligation.&quot; &quot;Fully Empowered&quot; marvelously embodies both Neruda's sense of moral duty and the joy that proceeds from his life's work.	2001-07-22

Trevisan is not an outside observer; he is himself an important activist in the 20th century gay movement in that country. The book has been translated into English by Martin Foreman. Although some mention is made of lesbian issues, the book focuses on the male experience.<br />Trevisan's opening chapter explores the homoerotic odysseys of two foreigners (one Argentine, one Belgian) in 20th century Brazil. The next chapter travels back in time to explore Brazilian homosexuality during the colonial period, when slavery and the Inquisition were important cultural forces. Other chapters look at homosexual activity among the Krao Indians, cross-dressing in the 19th century theater, gay characters on Brazilian television, anti-gay violence, and psychiatric approaches to homosexuality.<br />Trevisan also considers significant figures in the history of gay Brazilian literature, such as Adolfo Caminha (author of the groundbreaking 19th century gay-themed novel &quot;Bom-Crioulo&quot;). Trevisan also writes about the difficulties he faced in getting his own gay-themed fiction published.<br />Probably the most fascinating chapter, &quot;Gay Politics and the Manipulation of Homosexuality,&quot; deals with Trevisan's own involvement in the pioneering gay magazine &quot;Lampiao&quot; and with the formation of the gay activist group &quot;Somos.&quot; As a delightful appendix, the book contains Trevisan's interview with Mario Miranda (also known as Maria Aparecida), a gay, cross-dressing priest of Candomble, the Afro-Brazilian religion that can be seen as a counterpart to Voodoo of Haiti. This interview contains a short but informative preface that is full of fascinating information about this religion.<br />&quot;Perverts in Paradise&quot; is a well-written, informative work of nonfiction. I highly recommend this book to those interested in Brazilian history and culture, or in gay studies. I also recommend &quot;Now the Volcano: An Anthology of Latin American Gay Literature,&quot; edited by Winston Leyland; that book contains Joao Silverio Trevisan's excellent short story &quot;Jonathan's Bequest to David.&quot;nd culture, or in gay studies.

As the book's subtitle indicates, these essays explore various aspects of the world of poetry. The book has been translated from Spanish into a very readable English by Helen Lane.<br />Paz considers the work and legacies of many poets: Dante, Milton, Whitman, Sor Juana, Eliot, Baudelaire, and others. He questions the concepts of modernity and postmodernity, and considers various interrelated avant-garde literary movements: Futurism, Dadaism, Simultaneism, etc. He also reflects on the relationship between his own poetry and prose writings.<br />Along the way are some marvelous nuggets, such as his definition of a poem: &quot;a thing made of words, for the purpose of containing and secreting a substance that is impalpable, resistant to definition, and called poetry&quot; (from &quot;The Few and the Many&quot;). The book ends on a prophetic note of hope: &quot;. . . I can say, with a modicum of certainty, that as long as there are people, there will be poetry.&quot; I recommend &quot;The Other Voice&quot; to all those interested in Latin American literature or poetry in general.	2001-07-20

The poems have been translated into English by Celeste Kostopulos-Cooperman, Cola Franzen, and Mary G. Berg. The book is presented in bilingual format, with the Spanish originals and English versions on facing pages.<br />In her preface, Agosin explains that this book commemorates the 50th anniversary of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Agosin notes in the preface that poets &quot;have become the voices that ask for compassion for the voiceless victims. They see beauty amidst the horror and find the courage to speak against injustice.&quot; The poems in this book exemplify this mission.<br />Some of the most striking selections in this book include &quot;The Obedient Girl,&quot; about a girl who encounters the general who tortured her family; &quot;The President,&quot; a bitter satire of military dictatorship; &quot;El Salvador,&quot; the story of a Jewish woman from that troubled nation; and &quot;Anne Frank and Us,&quot; in which the speaker notes that the iconic title figure &quot;visits me often.&quot; I recommend this book to those interested in women's studies, Latin American literature, Spanish language poetry, or human rights issues.	2001-07-20

The text by Elizabeth Partridge is complemented by Aki Sogabe's colorful illustrations.<br />&quot;Oranges&quot; tells the story of Jo Lee, a Chinese boy who emigrates to California, where he works as a fisherman with his uncle. He misses his mother, who is still in China, but he plants orange branches that she gave him to take on his journey.<br />This is a realistic immigrant story with some fantastic/supernatural touches that evoke traditional Chinese beliefs. Illustrator Aki Sogabe creates many memorable scenes: a letter writer engaged in Chinese calligraphy, the Dragon King flying over a stormy ocean, Jo Lee tending his orange saplings, and more. To sum up: this is an excellent book for children of all cultures.	2001-07-20

The poems have been translated into English by Edward V. Coughlin. The book is presented in bilingual format, with the Spanish originals and English versions on facing pages.<br />Sosa's work shows great compassion for the poor and oppressed, especially in poems like &quot;The Poor,&quot; &quot;Three Shadows Reversed in the Mirror,&quot; &quot;The People,&quot; and others. His language is frequently direct and uncluttered, and sometimes surreal and cryptic. He often uses striking images, such as the following: &quot;May there be children who have toys, / bread / and stars under their shoes&quot; (from &quot;The City of the Beggar Children&quot;).<br />Sosa's voice can be prophetic (see, for example, &quot;Testimonies&quot;), and can evoke the style of Walt Whitman (&quot;The Grass Cut by the Peasants&quot;). This is an important volume for those interested in Latin American poetry.	2001-07-20

The book is richly illustrated throughout with full-color photographs, and includes a glossary of various terms.<br />The photos in this book are marvelous. We see a wolf pup being born, a pup nursing, pups playing with each other, an adult wolf stalking prey, and adult pack members tearing into a downed prey animal. Although some of the pictures are rather graphic, many are cute and funny. Overall, a good resource for children (and adults!) who are interested in wolves, or in wildlife in general.	2001-07-20

The collection has been compiled and arranged by Judy M. Johnson, who also provides an introduction.<br />The illustrations in this book depict the hair styles, clothing, and hat styles of this era. The illustrations also depict ideal women engaging in various activities: dancing, going on a horse drawn carriage ride, cooking and doing other household chores, etc. There are pictures of wedding dresses, home exteriors and interiors, etc.<br />Yes, these pictures undoubtedly present a sanitized portrait of the era. But this book is an interesting visual resource which opens a window onto the social values of the years from 1910-1929.	2001-07-20

The book has been translated into English by Harriet de Onis. &quot;Dona Flor&quot; tells the story of the title character, a cooking instructor who is widowed and who eventually contemplates remarriage.<br />&quot;Dona Flor&quot; is a big, sensuous, lusty novel that colorfully  evokes the food, music, dance, sexual mores, ethnic diversity, and religious diversity of Brazil. Amado creates a huge tapestry of fascinating characters: the admirable Dona Flor; Vadinho, her roguish first husband; Dona Rozilda, her meddling mother; the gossipy Dona Dinora; gambling czar Pelancchi Moulas; and more.<br />Amado enlivens the novel with many delightful touches. He sprinkles Brazilian recipes into the text, and also offers insights into Candomble, an Afro-Brazilian folk religion with a colorful pantheon of deities.<br />&quot;Dona Flor&quot; is full of funny, romantic, and sexy scenes. The novel's plot also has an important magical/supernatural element. I highly recommend this novel, especially to those who are interested in Brazilian literature.	2001-07-20

Stavans, who moved to the United States and writes in English, has a complex perspective which is reflected in this book.<br />Much of this book deals with Latin American literature. Stavans' essays are informative, and frequently rich in intriguing insights. But I often found his style pompous and arrogant. I particularly disliked his many nasty comments about other Latino/Hispanic writers: he calls Mario Vargas Llosa a &quot;dilettante&quot; (in &quot;Two Peruvians&quot;); he dismisses Cherrie Moraga's work as &quot;highly predictable and often stale&quot; (&quot;Art and Anger&quot;); he refers to the career of Gabriel Garcia Marquez as &quot;curiously disappointing,&quot; and says that this author's &quot;Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor&quot; is &quot;forgettable and poorly structured&quot; (&quot;The Master of Aracataca&quot;). Some of his cruelest comments are directed at Octavio Paz, whom he accuses of having a &quot;relentless need to be worshiped and applauded.&quot; I have no doubt that many educated readers will disagree with these and other highly subjective statements.<br />Other essays in the collection are also troublesome. &quot;The Latin Phallus: A Survey&quot; contains interesting comments on such gay Latin American writers as Reinaldo Arenas and Jose Lezama Lima. But the essay as a whole is poorly structured (to steal one of Stavans' phrases) and ultimately unsatisfying.<br />Still, there are many good points in this collection. I was particularly intrigued by &quot;Tongue Snatcher,&quot; about Argentine-born Hector Bianciotti, who writes in his adopted language of French. Overall, I recommend &quot;Art and Anger&quot; to those interested in Latin American studies, but I suggest that it be read with a critical eye.	2001-07-20

The book is simple in concept and execution: Grandma is shown saying goodbye to her sleeping family (including the cat and dog), her garden, her town, and the earth. She ascends (with wings) into the sky, saying &quot;Hello, Stars!&quot;<br />The book is nondenominational, although the wings on Grandma may reflect Christian pop-culture iconography. And the book does imply that there is an afterlife, although it is vague about the nature of that afterlife.<br />The simple text is nicely complemented by colorful, cartoonish illustrations. This book could be a good resource for parents who are seeking a way to teach their children about death. However, parents with strong beliefs specific to their own religion (Hindu, Jewish, Roman Catholic, etc.) may want to get a book more geared to that tradition.	2001-07-18

Ellerbe opens by saying that the Christian legacy &quot;fosters sexism, racism, the intolerance of difference, and the desecration of the natural environment&quot; and goes on to intelligently justify her position.<br />Ellerbe covers the suppression of theological diversity in early Christianity (including the suppression of alternative gospel texts), the Crusades, the Inquisition, genocide against Native Americans, the witch hunts of the 1400s-1700s, and other atrocities committed under the direction of Christian churches. The book is thoroughly annotated, and contains a substantial bibliography for further reading.<br />My only criticism of Ellerbee's book is that, if anything, she doesn't go far enough. This is especially true in her brief mention of Christian complicity in the slave trade. The intertwining of Christian churches and theologies with slavery is a truly vast phenomenon with a huge body of documentation (start with Frederick Douglass' &quot;Narrative&quot; and Harriet Jacobs' &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot;). But I suppose there is only so much an author can accomplish in a book of about 220 pages.<br />I recommend &quot;The Dark Side&quot; both to intellectually honest Christians and to non-Christians who may be the targets of some of the types of bigotry that have historically been intertwined with Christianity. As a companion text, try &quot;The Bible Tells Me So: Uses and Abuses of Holy Scripture,&quot; by Jim Hill and Rand Cheadle.	2001-07-17

Lovecraft is one of this elite crew, If you want to know the definition of &quot;Lovecraftian,&quot; check out &quot;The Best of H.P. Lovecraft: Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre.&quot; This book brings together 16 masterful tales, together with an introduction by Robert Bloch.<br />It is perhaps too limiting to simply define Lovecraft as a horror writer; his stories also demonstrate elements of fantasy, science fiction, satire, and &quot;local color&quot; fiction. You'll get all these &quot;flavors&quot; in this collection. And along the way you'll encounter strange monsters, weird cults, forbidden books of the blackest magic, snippets of an unknown language, and a disturbing warp in the fabric of space and time.<br />Many of these stories, while standing alone as compelling pieces of fiction, also work together towards creating Lovecraft's own personal mythos. Thus, certain elements turn up in multiple stories: Miskatonic University, Cthulhu, and the feared Necronomicon.<br />Lovecraft is a master of complex, collage-like texts that incorporate references to people, institutions and periodicals, both real and imaginary. His style has an unsettling way of warping the reader's grip on reality. In many stories there is a sense that Lovecraft is satirizing the world of academia (some of his narrators and other characters are college professors, or otherwise connected to academia). If you have not yet entered the weird, wondrous world of H.P. Lovecraft, check out this collection. Also recommended: Lovecraft's &quot;At the Mountains of Madness and Other Tales of Terror.&quot;	2001-07-17

The book contains a general foreword and four sections: &quot;Quetzalcoatl: an Aztec Hero Myth&quot;; &quot;The Ritual of Condolence: An Iroquois Ceremonial&quot;; &quot;Cuceb: A Maya Prophecy&quot;; and &quot;The Night Chant: A Navajo Ceremonial.&quot; Each of the four sections contains primary texts translated into English, an individual introduction, extensive commentary following the text, a map, and a substantial bibliography.<br />This book is a superb resource for scholars, students, and people with a general interest in the native cultures of the Americas. The primary texts and supplemental materials offer a rich window into these cultures. These texts are not easy reading; I assigned parts of the Quetzalcoatl narratives to a college literature class I taught, and some of the students had trouble understanding the material. But for the attentive reader, &quot;Four Masterworks&quot; is a very rewarding volume. As a companion text, I recommend &quot;Coming to Light: Contemporary Translations of the Native Literatures of North America,&quot; edited by Brian Swann.	2001-07-17

Approximately 800 pages long, this anthology brings together materials from all over the continent.

Some of the most remarkable selections include the Wolverine tales of the Innu, which are masterpieces of bawdy humor, and the Yupik tale of &quot;The Boy Who Went to Live with the Seals,&quot; a magical story of human/animal relations. I highly recommend &quot;Coming to Light.&quot;	2001-07-16

Here is the premise: The earth star ship Discipline discovers the &quot;Smoke Ring,&quot; a donut-shaped atmosphere inhabiting a neutron star. Life has evolved in this Smoke Ring, which is a virtually gravity-free environment. The &quot;landscape&quot; (if you could call it that) of the Smoke Ring is dominated by the massive plants known as the Integral Trees.<br />But 500 years later, the descendants of the Discipline crew have evolved into a new sub-species of humanity, a sub-species whose physiology and culture is geared towards this environment. &quot;The Integral Trees&quot; is the story of these people, and of the Discipline's still active artificial intelligence.<br />Niven has succeeded in creating a world which is both truly alien and profoundly human. This is a classic of late 20th century science fiction.	2001-07-16

The poems have been translated into English by Candace Slater. This is a bilingual edition, with the Portuguese originals and English versions on facing pages.<br />Bandeira has an engaging poetic voice. He writes about love, childhood, Brazilian culture, the cycle of life and death, and poetry itself. His attentive poetic eye finds both tragedy and beauty in many small things: poor children looking at balloons in &quot;desire and wonder&quot; (&quot;Balloons&quot;), a kitten urinating in the garden of a hotel (&quot;Two-Star Hotel&quot;), etc. His poems are graced at times with touches of humor, such as in his poem about a child's pet guinea pig (&quot;Guinea Pig&quot;).<br />Other memorable selections include &quot;Poetics,&quot; in which he declares &quot;I prefer the lyricism of madmen / the lyricism of drunks&quot;; &quot;Voodoo at Pai Zuse's,&quot; about the activities of a Macumba priest; and the metaphysical vision &quot;I Saw a Rose.&quot; This book is an important resource for scholars of Brazilian literature, but I also recommend it to those who enjoy poetry in general.	2001-07-16

The book includes an interesting introductory essay by Bob Colacello, who notes that Warhol &quot;approached the portraits like he did everything else--with diligence, creativity, and a fair amount of greed.&quot; Among the interesting tidbits shared by Colacello is the story of Warhol's unsuccessful attempt to woo Imelda Marcos into commissioning multiple portraits.<br />The portraits include both paintings (polymer paint and silkscreen ink on canvas) and drawings. The book features alternative versions of some portraits; this feature helps to illuminate Warhol's technique. The portraits are at times whimsical, at times playful, at times a touch sinister, and at times quite elegant. Overall, an essential volume for those interested in Warhol's multifaceted legacy.	2001-07-15

The book has been translated into English by Mark Fried. Galeano's text is enriched on nearly every 2-page spread by the woodcut illustrations of Jose Francisco Borges.<br />Like Galeano's superb &quot;Book of Embraces,&quot; this is a book that defies a simple classification by genre. &quot;Walking Words&quot; is made up of a series of stories that are interspersed with short pieces that often read like mini-essays or prose poems. Most of the stories contain fantastic elements: a talking dog, a man who wants to become pregnant, human/animal transformations, etc. The short interludes are sometimes humorous, sometimes philosophical, sometimes mystical. Many of the interludes reflect on the nature of language and writing. In this book Galeano draws on Guarani Indian belief, the Cabala, Christian theology, Latin American folk custom, and other sources.<br />Borges' woodcuts are a marvelous text on their own: he captures human, animal, and supernatural images that are often whimsical and/or grotesque. Overall, a fascinating book; I especially recommend it to those who are interested in Latin American literature.	2001-07-15

Cohen writes in a clear, accessible style, and handles controversial issues with a firm and non-sensational confidence.<br />Cohen begins by considering the impact of the controversial book &quot;The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life,&quot; by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray. Cohen goes on to deconstruct prevailing notions about &quot;race.&quot; He claims &quot;'Races' as depicted in the popular imagination do not exist and have never existed&quot; (chapter 2) and considers such scientific evidence as data about blood types in order to support his assertion.<br />Cohen examines human culture, language in particular, and considers the often arbitrary nature of cultural phenomena. Among the phenomena he discusses are &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,&quot; breast feeding, IQ tests, and the debate over &quot;Ebonics.&quot; Overall, an intelligent, thought-provoking book.	2001-07-15

Her work has been translated into English by Steven F. White. This is a bilingual edition, with the Spanish originals and English versions on facing pages.<br />Belli's voice is passionate, lusty, sensual, tender, and politically aware. Many of her poems are woman-centered; she writes about menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, physical love, and pride in being a woman. Many poems deal with the Nicaraguan revolution and its aftermath. One of the best poems in the collection, &quot;The Dream Bearers,&quot; is a prophetic poem of hope in which Belli celebrates those who dream &quot;not of the world's destruction, / but of building a world of butterflies / and nightingales.&quot; Also memorable is &quot;Conjunction,&quot; in which Belli reflects on the women writers of past generations. This is a fine collection of poetry that I enthusiastically recommend, particularly to those with an interest in women's studies or Latin American literature.	2001-07-15

The poems have been translated into English by the  mother/daughter team of Elinor and Margaret Randall. The poems are presented in a bilingual format, with the Spanish originals and English versions on facing pages.<br />Many of Zamora's poems are about feminist issues and/or the Nicaraguan revolution. Her work is graced my moments of both hope and paradox. Many poems recall the lives of various women: a female guerrilla (&quot;Commander Two&quot;), an oppressed wife (&quot;Loyal Housewife&quot;), a nurse enraged at United States action in Nicaragua (&quot;Emilia, the Nurse&quot;), and more. There is even a poem about the women of Greco-Roman mythology (&quot;Alter Ego&quot;).<br />One of the collection's most distinctive pieces is &quot;Radio Sandino,&quot; a long poem which evokes scenes from Nicaragua's civil war. Zamora frequently evokes or pays tribute to other poets: Gabriela Mistral, Sylvia Plath, Ruben Dario, etc. Overall, an impressive collection by a strong voice in Latin American literature.	2001-07-13

This slim book contains Andrew Hurley's English translation of the story, eleven illustrations by Erik Desmazieres, and an introduction by Angela Giral.<br />&quot;Library&quot; is the quintessential &quot;Borgesian&quot; tale. The story concerns an infinite library, composed of endlessly connected hexagonal galleries, and populated by inhabitants among whom have risen various weird belief systems and subcultures. The first-person narrator is one of the library's residents. &quot;Library&quot; is a masterpiece of the fantastic and the metaphysical.<br />Giral notes in her introduction that Desmaziere's engravings are not literal representations of scenes from the story, but rather &quot;the product of a parallel imagination, inspired to create in visual images his own, equivalent universe.&quot; The etchings have an elegant, majestic, and sometimes whimsical quality that effectively complements Borges' unique imagination. This book would make a nice gift for lovers of Borges, or of fantastic literature in general.	2001-07-13

Much of this book deals with these painful realities. The book includes a helpful chronology of the Argentine turmoil from 1966-95. Unfortunately, this is an English-only edition; I would have preferred a bilingual edition.<br />Many of Gelman's poems are dark and mournful. This is understandable, since many of them deal with such subjects as exile, torture, and assassination. There are also poems about love, and about poetry itself. I was especially moved by his series of prose poems that explore the psychological landscape of the exile. He writes, &quot;I am a monstrous plant. My roots are thousands of miles from me and no stem connects us&quot; (from &quot;Under Foreign Rain&quot; XVI).<br />This is a haunting and powerful volume. I highly recommend this book to those interested in Latin American poetry, literature of exile, and human rights.	2001-07-12

The collection has been translated into English by Samuel A. Zimmerman.<br />Many of the author's stories have a surreal or fantastic element to them, and some deal with erotic themes. The best of the bunch are &quot;Water,&quot; the quirky story of a magician who kidnaps a teenage girl and trains her as his assistant; &quot;The Photograph,&quot; a kinky tale of voyeurism and brotherly bonding; and &quot;The Honeymoon,&quot; a bizarre story that is humorous, horrific, and sexual all at once. All in all, a collection well worth reading, especially for those with an interest in Latin American literature.	2001-07-12

The stories have been translated into English by Tobias Hecht. There are 30 short pieces in this collection; a good number of them are in the 3 to 6 page length range.<br />Many of Peri Rossi's stories are surreal or absurd. Some have subtle comic touches. Although her work invites comparison to other such Latin American writers as Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortazar, Peri Rossi is a remarkable talent in her own right. Her stories, as translated by Hecht, have both a stark, crystalline purity and a painful beauty.<br />&quot;Museum&quot; includes stories about violence, death, alienation, dislocation, and frustrated desire. The stories often feature unnamed characters in unnamed locales. Some of the most intriguing pieces in the &quot;Museum&quot; include &quot;Tarzan's Roar,&quot; a deconstruction of a Hollywood icon; &quot;The Lizard Christmas,&quot; which ironically comments on Christian tradition; and &quot;the Effect of Light on Fish,&quot; which moves gracefully from an innocuous beginning to a disturbing climax. Overall, a frequently stunning collection by a very talented writer.	2001-07-12

This is a bilingual edition, with Cabral's Portuguese originals and the English translations on facing pages. The translations are by editor Kadir, Elizabeth Bishop, Galway Kinnell, Ricardo da Silveira Lobo Sternberg, and others.<br />Cabral (as I read him through the translators) writes with a directness and clarity. Many of his poems are about poetry and writing in general. He also has a number of poems about other poets and creative artists: Marianne Moore, W. H. Auden, Mondrian, Paul Klee, etc. Especially moving is his painful, but beautiful poem about Spanish poet Miguel Hernandez (&quot;Encounter with a Poet&quot;).<br />Other excellent poems include &quot;Culling Beans,&quot; in which the title act becomes a metaphor for writing (hence the title of this review); &quot;The Death and Life of a Severino,&quot; with its flavor of social protest; and &quot;Weaving the Morning,&quot; a wonderful poem about roosters greeting the dawn. I recommend this book to those interested in Brazilian literature or 20th century poetry.	2001-07-07

I have read the English translation by John Gledson. In the foreword to his translation, Gledson notes that the book was first published in 1899 or 1900.<br />&quot;Dom Casmurro&quot; is a first-person narrative about the life of Bento, a 19th century Brazilian man. Bento recalls his youth and adulthood, and tells about his friendships, education, romantic life, and family relationships.<br />The content of the novel sounds straightforward enough, but its execution is a virtuoso display of ironic playfulness. Machado's narrator addresses various potential readers, from the &quot;'most chaste' lady reader&quot; to young lads. The narrator comments on the structure of the story and plays with readers' expectations, and even at one point challenges the reader to throw the book out. Machado's narrative technique blurs the line between fiction and reality.<br />&quot;Dom Casmurro&quot; is an effective mix of comic and tragic elements. Particularly interesting are the gently satiric portrayal of religion, the tender evocation of youthful romance, and the many European cultural references. This is a story of love, jealousy, and loss, told with wit and compassion by Machado. Highly recommended for all those interested in Latin American fiction.	2001-07-07

This is a bilingual edition, with Futoransky's Spanish originals and the English versions on facing pages. This volume is edited by Jason Weiss, who also did the English translations. The poems included are drawn from 6 books, originally published from 1972 to 1997.<br />The back cover information notes that Futoransky was born and raised in Buenos Aires, the child of Polish-Jewish immigrants, and has lived in many other nations all over the world. Her poems reflect this international, multicultural personal and family heritage. Futoransky takes us from the Rue de Charenton to Masada, from the coasts of Portugal to a Buddhist cemetery for samurais. In her poems we encounter &quot;knicknacks from Byzantium,&quot; &quot;a tune by Piaf,&quot; &quot;old Hebrew tombstones,&quot; and a host of other cultural phenomena.<br />Figures from Jewish scripture, legend, and history sometimes appear: Lilith, Noah's Ark, etc. A number of poems evoke the people and culture of Japan.<br />Futoransky's language is at times passionate, at times ironic, at times cryptic. My favorite poem in the book, &quot;Robotics,&quot; draws connections among the Egyptian ushebtis, the golem of Jewish folklore, robots, and automatic teller machines. This poem is an intriguing document from a place in space-time where technology, myth, and history intersect. Overall, I recommend this book to those interested in Latin American or Jewish literature, or to anyone interested in experiencing a unique and challenging poetic voice.	2001-07-06

The book tells the story of David, a young adoptee whose family is preparing to adopt a second child: a Korean baby boy named Jin Woo.<br />Like many children expecting a new child into the family, David has some concerns. But his parents assure him that the love they share with the new baby will not diminish the love they have for him. And David bonds with his new brother, ensuring the unity of the newly enlarged family.<br />This is a good story with educational value. The author brings up some interesting aspects of cross-cultural/international adoption. The easy-to-read text is well complemented by Soentpiet's colorful, realistic illustrations. I recommend &quot;Jin Woo&quot; for both home and classroom.	2001-07-06

This is a bilingual edition, with the Spanish originals and English versions on facing pages. The translations into English are by Martin Espada and Camilo Perez-Bustillo.<br />Soto Velez' language is sensuous and oddly beautiful. He often uses a rhythmic repetition, and also frequently employs an idiosyncratic syntax. His words often combine to form surreal, and frequently striking, images: &quot;the orange winds of reason,&quot; &quot;the castrated tree,&quot; &quot;thunder in the cartilage of the future,&quot; etc.<br />Soto Velez' poems often have a political edge; he expresses a concern for human persecution and liberation. And he also writes of the vocation of the poet: &quot;poet / you / are / light transformed into humanity&quot; (from &quot;The Promised Land&quot;).<br />&quot;The Blood That Keeps Singing&quot; is not easy reading, but it is rewarding reading for those who wish to explore a daring and distinctive poetic voice. I especially recommend this book to those interested in Puerto Rican literature. As a companion volume I recommend &quot;Song of the Simple Truth,&quot; the collected work of Julia de Burgos, another important Puerto Rican poet.	2001-07-06

Written by Alicia Steimberg, the book has been translated into English by Andrea G. Labinger.<br />Steimberg reflects on the autobiographical roots of this book in an author's note. This is a colorful, frequently humorous narrative. We meet several interesting characters, including her maternal grandmother (an emigrant from Kiev) and her maternal grandfather (a secular Jew and socialist).<br />Steimberg's narrator (named Alicia, like the author) tells about her experience of anti-Semitism, her sexual awakening, her fascination with Roman Catholicism, and other topics. Particularly interesting is the portrayal of life under Peronism. &quot;Musicians and Watchmakers&quot; is an enjoyable contribution to both Latin American and Jewish literature.	2001-07-03

Altogether, these illustrations take the reader on an epic journey through time and space, across the worlds of both nature and technology.<br />There are many memorable images in this book: dinosaurs in fierce battle with each other, a sailing ship battered by a storm, a transcendent-looking Einstein haloed by celestial bodies, an army of ants on the march, majestic-looking World War II-era naval vessels, a close view of Saturn's rings, etc. Amidst all of the &quot;big&quot; pictures, there are also smaller and gentler sights, like Mary Eaton's delicate botanical watercolors. This is a marvelous collection of illustrations that invites you to return again and again.	2001-07-03

The book has been translated into English by Richard Schaaf. In this book, Neruda considers the political upheavals and abuses that have occurred in many Latin American nations: Cuba, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Panama, and others.<br />Many of these poems contain harsh invective directed at specific political figures. If there's a &quot;hero&quot; to this book, it's Fidel Castro, who is praised along with the Cuban communist revolution. The villain of the book is the United States, which is almost always mentioned in a negative light.<br />Neruda is a passionate writer, and his poems are thought-provoking. And interspersed throughout the harder-edged poems are some more introspective pieces in which Neruda reflects upon his own poetic vocation. Some of these reflective poems have a Whitmanesque flavor--Neruda even invokes Walt Whitman in one of them (&quot;To a North American Friend&quot;).<br />I don't think that &quot;Epic Song&quot; represents Neruda's best work. And I think that after reading the poems praising Castro's revolution, it would be wise to read the works of an anti-Castro Cuban dissident like Reinaldo Arenas (who was persecuted under the Castro regime). Still, &quot;Epic Song&quot; contains passages of real emotion and beauty, and is worth reading.	2001-07-03

In it author Paul C. McGlasson attacks liberation theology, one of the important currents in 20th century Christian theology.<br />McGlasson's basic argument is that the liberation theologians have departed from the true Christian path (as defined by McGlasson). McGlasson engages in name-calling and finger-pointing throughout the book: he accuses liberation theologians of teaching &quot;false doctrine&quot; and &quot;heresy.&quot; He compares them to &quot;fascists,&quot; even invoking the name of Hitler in his comparison (chapter 3). According to McGlasson, liberation theologians are &quot;profaning the name of our God.&quot;<br />This book has an angry, bitter, disrespectful tone throughout. For example, he mocks non-sexist language as a concession to the &quot;feminist lobby.&quot; The author is particularly harsh in his repeated condemnation of civil rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. McGlasson claims that the teaching of King, who was a Christian clergyman, &quot;is not the gospel of Jesus Christ&quot; (ch. 2). He goes on to suggest that King was a &quot;self-attested messiah&quot; and a &quot;false prophet&quot; (ch. 3).<br />McGlasson's attacks on King are weak because he fails in these attacks to quote from any of King's own writings. In fact, none of King's many works are even cited in the brief bibliography.<br />A McCarthyesque air of paranoia also pervades this book. As an example of the &quot;theological fascism&quot; that is allegedly sweeping the Christian world, the author gives an anecdotal example of an unnamed instructor in an unnamed seminary who allegedly was ill-treated because of his theological conservatism.<br />Although McGlasson condemns the alleged self-appointed messiahs of the liberation theology movement, he seems to have appointed himself the new savior of Christianity. Each of his chapters ends with a command from the author: &quot;The church must. . .&quot; do this or that in order to come into line with McGlasson's beliefs.<br />In its naivete and self-parodic style, &quot;Another Gospel&quot; is almost funny. But in its bitterness, anger, and paranoia, the book is rather frightening.ith a command from the author: &quot;The church must. . .&quot; do this or that in order to come into line with McGlasson's beliefs.<br />In its naivete and self-parodic style, &quot;Another Gospel&quot; is almost funny.

The co-authors have collected excerpts from a huge body of historical documents in order to show how the Judeo-Christian Bible has been used to support a variety of positions, many of them contradictory.<br />As Hill and Cheadle show, verses from the Bible have been used to justify both slavery and its abolition, to promote persecution of the Jews, as tools in the deadly witch hunts in the 16th and 17th centuries, to both persecute and empower homosexuals, to support both Afrocentrism and white supremacy, to both justify and oppose war, to &quot;prove&quot; that the earth is the center of the universe, and more.<br />The book includes numerous quotes, sidebars, and illustrations. There are extensive bibliographic notes on each topic for those interested in further research.<br />This book should be required reading for all Christians (and for those non-Christians who may find themselves the targets of Bible-justified bigotry).<br />Sadly, the narrow-minded ideological fundamentalists who use the Bible to justify their positions will probably not be moved by this book; they will probably write it off as a Satan-inspired deception. But for the rest of us, this is a fascinating resource. Next time you hear someone use the phrase &quot;But the Bible says...&quot; in an argument, whip out this book.	2001-06-29

The author endured imprisonment under an oppressive regime in Argentina, and later left the country as an exile. This novel, as she states in a brief preface, is drawn from her experiences and from those of others who similarly suffered.<br />The novel focuses on Sara, a writer who (like the author) endures imprisonment and exile. The fragmented, sometimes disorienting text is made up of several elements: Sara's prison journal entries, letters between Sara and her sister, scenes from Sara's life outside prison, and more.<br />The novel explores the toll taken on those who endured these ordeals, and also looks at the effect of imprisonment on people's families. Kozameh's characters also reconsider the very concept of freedom. This haunting novel should be read by all those with a serious interest in Latin American literature or human rights.	2001-06-29

Lynn Plourde's easy-to-read rhyming text is nicely complemented by Greg Couch's excellent illustrations.<br />In this story, Winter is the playful child of Mother Earth and Father Time. The plot is simple: Winter waits for his father to finish work so that they can spend some time together. Winter amuses himself in the meantime by turning the world into a wintry playground. Sample text: \\"So Winter waits / for an hour or two, / painting the grass / with a frosty hue.\\"<br />Couch's colorful illustrations have a playfully surreal quality to them. Overall, this is a fun book that celebrates both family ties and the virtue of patience.	2001-06-29

Although it is directed towards children, it is a good resource for all ages. Leslie Kimmelman's well-written text is effectively complemented by Ora Eitan's colorful, impressionistic illustrations.<br />The text covers the major Jewish observances: Rosh Hashahah, Yom Kippur, Yom Hashoah, etc. The name of each observance is given both in Hebrew characters and in English translation or transliteration. The text gives definitions of such relevant terms as shofar, sukkah, and latkes.<br />There is a lot of fun supplementary material: a recipe for harvest muffins, instructions on how to play the dreidel game, a retelling of the story of Jonah, and more. Eitan's illustrations are excellent: they range from the solemn to the whimsical. Overall, this is a good book for children of all religious and cultural backgrounds.	2001-06-28

The essays in this book reflect a turbulent era: the late 1960s (Merton's preface is dated 1967).<br />Merton has a progressive, open-minded Christian vision. He writes about nonviolence, the Vietnam War, the Black Power movement, and &quot;Death-of-God&quot; theology. Interesting specific pieces include articles on the prison meditations of Jesuit Alfred Delp (who was persecuted by the Nazis), on Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh (&quot;my brother&quot;), and on the &quot;Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; (&quot;a book of decisive importance&quot;). Particularly powerful is his critique of &quot;American Christian rightism,&quot; which, he writes, is &quot;a mystique of violence, of apocalyptic threats, of hatred, and of judgment&quot; (in &quot;Religion and Race in the United States&quot;).<br />This is a book that every Christian (and many of other belief systems) should read. Merton is an excellent writer, and his ideas remain compelling.	2001-06-28

The book is a guide to dozens of science fiction TV series dating from the 1950s to the late 1990s. The authors include British and U.S. series (as well as a few productions from elsewhere). A nice touch is the inclusion of children's series and short-lived series (such as TV's &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and &quot;The Fantastic Journey&quot;). Fantasy, as well as sci-fi, series are included.<br />For the main series profiled, the authors provide an introductory article as well as a complete episode guide. For each episode, they give a plot summary, as well as writing, directing, and guest-starring credits.<br />Not all the series are given such detailed attention; some only have the episode titles listed, and some don't even get that. In general, shows that get less comprehensive attention are shows that are primarily thought of as representatives of another genre: &quot;Bewitched&quot; (sitcom), &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; (action/adventure), etc.<br />Despite its sometimes incomplete nature, this is a wonderfully informative and entertaining book. Sci-fi staples and cult favorites are well represented: &quot;Babylon 5,&quot; &quot;Blake's 7,&quot; &quot;Quantum Leap,&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot; and its various sequels, &quot;The X-Files,&quot; etc. I particularly liked the ample attention given to short-lived shows that were nonetheless loved by devoted circles of viewers.<br />Of course, a book of this nature is generally out of date by the time it hits the bookshelves, so I am already anticipating a new edition. But until then, this book remains in an honored position in my library.	2001-06-28

The book contains the text of a poem which, according to the book cover, was read by Angelou to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.<br />This is a humanistic poem in the tradition of Walt Whitman and Pablo Neruda. In her straightforward poetic voice, Angelou articulates a global vision of the frailties and strengths of humanity, and expresses her hope for peace. This small book would make a good gift.	2001-06-28

Among the authors included are Jacqueline Goldberg (Venezuela), Sarina Helfgott (Peru), Alicia Kozameh (Argentina), Teresa Porzecanski (Uruguay), Leonor Scliar-Cabral (Brazil), and Ana Maria Shua (Argentina).<br />Editor Agosin contributes a fascinating forward (in English) in which she reflects on the &quot;Babel of whispers, songs, prayers, and languages&quot; she encountered growing up in Chile. Some of the subjects explored by the poets in this book include family ties, multi- and bilingualism, Jewish ritual, and the legacy of the Holocaust. Figures from Jewish history, myth, and legend often appear: Anne Frank, Ruth, Lilith, the Golem.<br />There are many fine poems in this anthology, but my favorites are the following: Schlomit Baytelman's &quot;My Name is Schlomit,&quot; Diana Anhalt's historically allusive &quot;That Jewish Crusader,&quot; Rosita Kalina's Whitmanesque &quot;I Am of the Tribe of Yehuda,&quot; and Angelina Muniz Huberman's mystical &quot;The Cabalists.&quot; This book is a wonderful resource for those interested in multiculturalism, Jewish studies, Latin American literature, or contemporary poetry.	2001-06-28

The novel is a brilliant exploration of this disorder: America's tortured racial legacy.<br />&quot;Invisible Man&quot; follows its young African-American narrator on an odyssey during which he encounters a host of memorable characters, both white and black. I read the novel primarily as a satire. Ellison rips into such phenomena as academia, industry, politics, and sexual taboo. The novel is full of wry symbolism and surreal flourishes. At times outrageous, at times grotesque, the novel examines some of the philosophies and world-views that tempted both black and white Americans in the early to mid-20th century. &quot;Invisible Man&quot; is essential reading for those interested in African-American studies, U.S. literature, or the 20th century novel.	2001-06-27

The story concerns Baby Duck, who finds a &quot;friend&quot; in a rubber ducky that has fallen off a toy truck into the river. Baby Duck follows his silent friend into an adventure. This is a fun book with beautiful, full-color illustrations. Some of the best-rendered scenes include moonlight playing across the water's surface and a lighthouse beacon illuminating the waves. And Baby Duck is a very appealing character. Overall, a very good book.	2001-06-27

De Veaux recreates the magic of Harlem in the late 1920s, the grimness of the Great Depression, and the excitement of Billie's early gigs as a young singer. &quot;Don't Explain&quot; also tells about the racism Billie endured, and about her struggle with drug addiction. Especially fascinating is De Veaux's version of the story behind the great protest song, &quot;Strange Fruit.&quot;<br />De Veaux writes in a smooth vernacular style. Interspersed throughout her poetic text are sections of drama-like dialogue between Billie and various individuals in her life. Photographs and sheet music are also blended, collage-like, into parts of the text.<br />I attended a presentation by author De Veaux during which she discussed this book. She said, &quot;For me, Billie Holiday was the quintessential symbol of Black female creativity.&quot; (Hence the title of this review.) &quot;Don't Explain&quot; is a beautifully written tribute to a great artist, and is itself a noteworthy achievement in African-American literature.	2001-06-27

Among the pieces in the book are commercial poster and song-sheet covers. Toulouse-Lautrec captured memorable images: dancers, women wearing fashionable clothes of the era, a clown, a carriage ride in the country, and more. This book is a great resource for those interested in art history.	2001-06-26

The book tells the story of human colonization of Mars--a Mars marked by the remains of a dying indigenous civilization. One can read the book as a metaphoric meditation on human history, or as a straightforward tale of an alternate reality. But however you approach it, the book is brilliant.<br />&quot;Chronicles&quot; consists of a series of interrelated short stories. The overall feel of the book is that of an epic saga, but it is an epic told in brief, intimate fragments. Particularly fascinating are the tales which capture the complex relationships between the human colonists and the native Martians.<br />&quot;Chronicles&quot; is at times whimsical, at times painful, at times ironic. But Bradbury's vision is always rich in compassion and insight. This is truly one of those science fiction masterworks which both transcends and ennobles the genre. Don't miss it.	2001-06-26

In this collection of essays and journal entries, Walker demonstrates the essential union of her political, spiritual, and artistic &quot;selves.&quot;<br />Walker writes about many topics: animal rights, her daughter's smoking habit, her father, the problematic legacy of Joel Chandler Harris, pioneering African-American thinker Benjamin Banneker, vegetarianism, Reggae legend Bob Marley, her own 1983 trip to China, and more. Particularly fascinating are her thoughts on the controversies surrounding her great novel &quot;The Color Purple.&quot;<br />Although the &quot;New Age&quot; vibe of much of the book may be too much for some readers, I found the book to be well-written and consistently interesting. Walker is a writer who has created a remarkable body of work, and &quot;Living by the Word&quot; is an excellent example of her passion and insight.	2001-06-25

The stories have been translated from Spanish into English by Mary Jane Treacy.<br />Rossi's work reminds me of the stories of Jorge Luis Borges: she frequently plays with notions of reality, psychology, and geographic dislocation. &quot;The Trip&quot; in particular is a Borgesian gem in which she writes about an imaginary language that has some remarkable characteristics. Other tales satirize religion and politics, or reflect on artistic creativity itself. Overall, this is a richly imaginative collection that is full of irony and witty absurdism.	2001-06-25

E. Woodward, is a visually rich window into the architecture of the late 19th century. This book is an unabridged reprint of a volume originally published in 1877 under the title &quot;Woodward's National Architect, Vol. II.&quot;<br />This book contains floor plans and elevations (both front and side) for both row houses and stand-alone houses. One fascinating aspect of this book is the inclusion of plans for the basements and attics, in addition to those for the primary floors. Also included are designs for gazebos and other structures.<br />You will see many of your favorite Victorian era architectural elements in this book: towers, covered porches, mansard roofs, and more. A series of detail pages focus on some specific decorative elements: dormer windows, balusters, finials, roof cresting, etc. Overall, an excellent book.	2001-06-25

The book has been translated into English by Cedric Belfrage, with Mark Schafer. This book is one of those texts that transcends genre. It consists of more than 150 short texts (most less than a page long) interspersed with Galeano's quirky, collage-like illustrations.<br />These short texts seem at times like essays, short stories, prose poems, or autobiographical fragments. By blending them together with his frequently whimsical graphics, Galeano creates his own unique form of literature.<br />Galeano writes about many topics. His short pieces take us all over Latin America--to Uruguay, Argentina, Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, and other countries--as well as to other parts of the world. He frequently reflects on life under dictatorships and mindless bureaucracies. And other Latin American writers frequently pop up: Claribel Alegria, Julio Cortazar, Mario Benedetti, and others.<br />Some of these short pieces are playfully humorous, others scathingly satirical, others gently compassionate, others hauntingly metaphysical. But throughout Galeano seems to maintain his faith in the human spirit: &quot;When it is genuine, when it is born of the need to speak, no one can stop the human voice&quot; (from &quot;Celebration of the Human Voice 2&quot;). &quot;The Book of Embraces&quot; is a book that you may want to embrace.	2001-06-23

The book tells how a young girl named Mary Anning discovered the first whole skeleton of an ichthyosaurus, an extinct species of marine reptile.<br />The book is full of fascinating illustrations of fossils, and of artistic recreations of ichthyosaurs. The only weak element of the book is the fact that the text is often superimposed over the illustrations, thus frequently resulting in text that is difficult to read. Still, this is a visually impressive educational text.	2001-06-22

Seid says &quot;No.&quot;<br />Seid explores the notion of secular Judaism: a way of life, or a cultural and ethical path, that is liberated from traditional notions of deity. You can be an agnostic or an atheist and still practice a meaningful form of Judaism, according to Seid. She offers suggestions for those interested in starting a secular Jewish congregation, and includes an informative &quot;question-and-answer&quot; section in the book.<br />Seid's book is well-written and thought provoking. Although she is writing from a Jewish perspective, I believe that many of her ideas could be equally useful to people of other faith traditions (Christian, Muslim, etc.).	2001-06-22

Books	5	113	119	N	N	Introducing the Tarot	As someone new to the study of the Tarot, I found Eden Gray's &quot;A Complete Guide to the Tarot&quot; to be the best general introduction to this fascinating divinatory system. Gray writes with a confident but accessible authority that makes her book very appealing.<br />Gray devotes one or two pages to every card in the classic Rider-Waite Tarot deck, and lists possible divinatory meanings. She shows how to use various spreads of the cards in order to give readings, and she also discusses the use of the Tarot as an aid in meditation. She also explores the connections between the Tarot and other systems of occult wisdom: numerology, astrology, and the Kabalah.<br />The book includes a bibliography for those interested in further study. Overall, I found this to be a useful and enjoyable book.	2001-06-22

The book collects the graphic designs of Alphonse Mucha, Maurice Verneuil, and Georges Auriol.<br />The many colorful designs in the book contain a number of different motifs: flowers, peacock feathers, seahorses, birds, butterflies, various geometric creations, and other elements. These decorative designs are often playful, often elegant. Overall, a fascinating and delightful book.	2001-06-22

The art is accompanied by text written by Chris Morrow; Neville Garrick wrote the foreword.<br />The vibrant, full color illustrations reproduce reggae album cover art of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. The cover art ranges from straightforward photographs of the Jamaican landscape and people to ambitious graphic designs. Many iconic images are featured: Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie (many times), the lion, the Star of David, marijuana plants, Che Guevera, and--of course--lots of dreadlocks. There are occasionally touches of satire and humor, such as a 1982 Prince Jammy cover spoofing the &quot;Space Invaders&quot; video game.<br />Artists whose covers are featured include Peter Tosh, Judy Mowatt, Black Uhuru, and the legendary Bob Marley and the Wailers. In his foreword, Neville Garrick pays tribute to Marley, noting that he &quot;is now regarded as the voice of the oppressed, regardless of their race, religion, or language.&quot;<br />I myself know fairly little about Reggae music, but I was captivated by the striking images contained in this book. &quot;Stir It Up&quot; is a noteworthy achievement.	2001-06-21

The author, Marjorie Agosin, is the descendant of European Jews who escaped the Holocaust; Agosin was raised in Chile. This is a bilingual edition, with Agosin's Spanish poems and the English translations on facing pages. Richard Schaaf is the primary translator, with additional translation done by Cola Franzen and Monica Bruno.<br />The book also includes Agosin's fascinating introductory essay, &quot;Anne Frank or the Landscape Uprooted&quot; (both in Spanish and in English translation). In this essay Agosin draws connections between the Nazi Holocaust and the atrocities committed under certain Latin American dictatorships.<br />Agosin's poems are somber and lean. Her voice is at times angry, at times compassionate, at times even a little wistful. She explores Anne Frank's role as young woman, as martyr, as writer, and as iconic figure. This is an important volume for those interested in Latin American literature, Holocaust studies, 20th century poetry, or Jewish studies.	2001-06-21

The book has been translated from Spanish into an effective English by Suzanne Jill Levine. This is a grim, tragic story about the lives of the residents of the doomed town of El Olivo.<br />The story focuses on La Manuela, a drag queen who owns a brothel, and his/her daughter, Japonesita (the story of Japonesita's conception is told in a series of vivid flashbacks). As Donoso peels back the layers from these and other memorable characters, he reveals a twisted story of lust, homophobia, violence, sexual ambiguity, and shattered dreams. And always in the background are the whores of El Olvido and the sinister black dogs owned by the powerful Don Alonso.<br />Donoso's remarkable mastery of language (as translated by Levine) perfectly complements this gripping story. If you are a fan of Latin American fiction, or if you are interested in gender themes in literature, you won't want to miss this trip to &quot;Hell.&quot;	2001-06-20

This is a bilingual edition, with Castellanos' Spanish originals and the English versions on facing pages. The poems have been translated by Magda Bogin, who co-edited the volume with Cecilia Vicuna.<br />Castellanos' work has a somber, introspective quality. Many of her poems are about death, pain, or sadness. Many of her lines demonstrate a rather dark world view. Example: &quot;We give life only to what we hate&quot; (from &quot;Destiny&quot;). Her language is at times romantic and sensuous, at times cynical: &quot;Don't trust a man in love: he's hungry, / all he wants is to devour&quot; (from &quot;Celestina's Advice&quot;). She sometimes uses memorable imagery: &quot;On the lips of the wind I shall be called / a tree of many birds&quot; (&quot;Two Poems&quot;).<br />I found Castellanos' poetry to have a psychological quality that reminded me of the work of two other Latin American women poets: Julia de Burgos (Puerto Rico) and Alfonsina Storni (Argentina). Those interested in Latin American poetry should seek out this volume.	2001-06-18

Ilan Stavans provides the introduction to this two-in-one volume.<br />&quot;Sun Inventions&quot; is the story of a female academic and her family situation. The stronger (and longer) of the two novellas is &quot;Perfumes.&quot; This is an engrossing multigenerational saga about a Jewish family that emigrates from the Syrian city of Aleppo to Uruguay. The family story takes place against the backdrop of a Uruguayan revolutionary movement of the 1930s. With its colorful, conflicted characters and problematic relationships, &quot;Perfumes&quot; has a Faulkneresque flavor.<br />The title of &quot;Perfumes&quot; refers to the perfume shop run by one of the novella's principal characters. In this novella Porzecanski explores such issues as racial conflict, propaganda, oral tradition, Jewish ethics, and the power of sensory cues to trigger memories and visions. &quot;Perfumes&quot; is a fascinating and rewarding text that effectively blends tragic and comic elements. If you are interested in Jewish studies, Latin American literature, or contemporary fiction, check out this volume.	2001-06-17

This book is actually a selection of poems from a larger cycle. This is a bilingual edition, with Cuadra's Spanish originals on each even numbered page, and the English translations on the odd-numbered pages. The poetry has been edited and translated by Grace Schulman and Ann McCarthy de Zavala; Schulman also wrote an informative introduction.<br />These poems tell the story of the sailor Cifar and of his life and travels on Lake Nicaragua. Through Cuadra's luminous poetry, we meet encounter the small islands, people, animals, and weather phenomena that are entwined in the tapestry of Cifar's life.<br />Cuadra's poetry is earthy and vibrant, with occasional mystical touches. As Schulman notes in her introduction, Cuadra is a poet of &quot;a greater American tradition&quot; that includes Walt Whitman.<br />Among the characters we meet along Cifar's odyssey are his formidable mother, the one-armed sailor Pascasio, the kind-hearted prostitute Mirna, and the sage known as the Master of Tarca. There are many outstanding selections in this book. My favorite poems include the &quot;The Birth of Cifar,&quot; which has a mythic flavor; the tragic &quot;Dead Calm&quot;; the haunting &quot;Cemetery of the Birds&quot;; and Cifar's beautiful prayer for his daughter Ubaldina. &quot;Songs of Cifar&quot; is an essential volume for those who love Latin American literature, 20th century poetry, or literature about sailors.	2001-06-17

He's Crazy!!&quot; is a collection of cartoons by John Callahan. Callahan has a distinctive style: his crude drawings look like they were created by 10-year old juvenile delinquent with a hand injury.<br />Callahan mercilessly mocks modern life. His twisted sense of humor embraces such topics as leprosy, torture, religion, eating disorders, bestiality, and especially suicide. He frequently mocks celebrities: Dan Quayle, Elvis, Picasso, Madonna (one of his favorite targets), and others. He is not shy about making fun of specific groups of people: blacks, Jews, Asians, the bald, the homeless, the handicapped, etc.<br />Although most of his work features human characters, he occasionally includes other creatures: cows, flies, aliens, etc. His work often has a political edge. And despite their frequently dark subject matter, Callahan's cartoons have a playful quality which I find very appealing, and very amusing.<br />In one of these cartoons, TV talk show host Geraldo Rivera is shown praying, &quot;Thank you, God for all the tragedy, wretchedness and perversion in the world.&quot; Callahan could make that same prayer himself. His gift is to look at the absurd, violent cesspool of humanity and give us all something to laugh at.	2001-06-15

The essay has been translated from Italian into English by Guy Bennett, who also wrote an introduction.<br />Steiner (1898-1964) was an Italian poet who is associated with the &quot;Futurist&quot; movement. In the essay he describes how the non-verbal poems in this book represent the next step in evolution of poetry after &quot;words-in-freedom,&quot; an experimental form of poetry that tore away grammar and syntax and mixed the freed words with lines, colors, distorted typographical characters, and other elements.<br />The &quot;poems&quot; in this book do away with words totally; rather, they are impressionistic drawings that seem like Steiner's own personal ideographic language. The only words in these poems are the titles: &quot;Wonder,&quot; &quot;Napoleon,&quot; &quot;Acute Physical Pain,&quot; &quot;Human Intelligence,&quot; &quot;Divine Intelligence,&quot; &quot;Thursday,&quot; etc.<br />Overall, this book is a fascinating experiment that, as translator Bennett writes, &quot;calls into question the very nature of poetry and the specificity of the poetic text.&quot; If you're interested in avant-garde literature, or in experimentalism in 20th century poetry, you won't want to miss this quirky book.	2001-06-15

This cartoonist has a very distinctive style: his crude line drawings look like they were created by a hospitalized mental patient. Callahan's work has a deranged, bizarre quality. Nothing is sacred when he starts mocking the world.<br />Callahan finds bitter humor in such subjects as suicide, capital punishment, bestiality, child molestation, eating disorders, Christianity, and ... sex. He often mocks celebrities: Connie Chung, Rush Limbaugh, Madonna (a favorite target), Bill Clinton, George Bush, and more. No group of people is off limits: he pokes fun at men, women, whites, blacks, Asians, gay men, lesbians, Jews, the handicapped, and others.<br />...If you've got the stomach for this uncompromising vision, you might find \\"What Kind of God \\" to be both brilliant and hilarious.

This is a bilingual edition, with Paz' Spanish originals on each even-numbered page, and English translations on each odd-numbered page. The translations represent the collaborative work of several individuals: Muriel Rukeyser (who also wrote a foreword), Paul Blackburn, Lysander Kemp, Denise Levertov, and William Carlos Williams.<br />The poems in this book represent a mix of short, haiku-like verses; prose poems; and longer poems. Although Paz is a distinctive and original talent, some of his work seems to echo the spirit of such earlier poets as William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Stephen Crane.<br />Paz often writes about writing and language, often with a metaphysical, reality-warping perspective. His poems include a multicultural mix of interesting references: Polyphemus, Buddha, Tlaloc, the Tower of Babel, etc. He uses much striking imagery, and frequently his writing has a prophetic tone.<br />There are many fine poems in this collection, but I was particularly impressed by &quot;The prisoner,&quot; his stunning homage to the Marquis de Sade: &quot;The letters of your name are still a scar that will not heal, / the tattoo of disgrace on certain faces.&quot; If you are interested in Latin American literature or 20th century poetry, I recommend this book.	2001-06-13

The book illustrates the process of building a web, and shows other essential aspects of a spider's life. Overall, a very informative and enjoyable book.	2001-06-13

Hussey, is an unabridged republication of &quot;Hussey's National Cottage Architecture,&quot; which appeared in 1874. The book contains clear, crisp perspective drawings and floor plans for a number of home designs. The houses range from small cottages to fairly large 5-bedroom homes.<br />The designs depicted seem to represent mostly the Italianate and Second Empire styles of Victorian era architecture. Some of the features readers will see in these pages are Mansard roofs, low-pitched gabled roofs with decorative brackets, bay windows, towers, decorative roof cresting, and covered verandas.<br />The book also contains pages with fascinating close-up renderings of various design details. This book is an excellent choice for those who have become enchanted by the romance of Victorian home architecture.	2001-06-10
1966420:US	51987970	RHMWTO5MMB0IA	0809306530	569829998	The Villagers (Huasipungo)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A searing novel of social protest	&quot;The Villagers,&quot; a novel by Jorge Icaza of Ecuador, was first published in 1934. It has been translated into English by Bernard Dulsey. I think of &quot;The Villagers&quot; as a sort of Ecuadoran counterpart to &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; (the classic anti-slavery novel by United States author Harriet Beecher Stowe). Like that earlier novel, Icaza's book is an impassioned expose of racially-charged violence and oppression.<br />&quot;The Villagers&quot; tells the story of the exploitation of Ecuadoran Indians by whites who are intent on taking economic advantage of the Indians' homeland. Icaza paints a fascinating portrait of the conflicts and twisted connections among three major groups: Indians, whites, and &quot;cholos&quot; (those of mixed blood). The &quot;gringos,&quot; or white North Americans, form a sinister fourth group that lurks menacingly behind the scenes of the unfolding drama.<br />The novel is full of vivid, graphic details--lice infestation, a worm-infected wound, rape, suffering, and death. Icaza mercilessly satirizes the lust and greed of the white landowner, Don Alfonso. Icaza also savagely critiques the complicity of the church (in the form of the hypocritical village priest) in the abuse of the Indians. And the author also exposes the insidious debt bondage that turns nominally &quot;free&quot; people into virtual slaves.<br />Some of the more villainous characters seem a bit one-dimensional, but in my opinion the many strengths of the book outweigh this flaw. &quot;The Villagers&quot; is a powerful work of social protest that deserves a wide readership.	2001-06-09

He finds himself entangled in an authoritarian, bureaucratic nightmare. The novel has been translated into a stark English by David William Foster.<br />The novel's creepy, sometimes gruesome touches are oddly complemented by a current of ironic humor. Overall, the novel is strikingly similar in theme and tone to &quot;Bedside Manners,&quot; by Luisa Valenzuela (another talented Argentine writer). If you're in the mood for a Kafkaesque satire, give &quot;Patient&quot; a read.	2001-06-09

In 1955, 8 crew members of a Colombian naval vessel were washed overboard. One of them, Luis Alejandro Velasco, survived 10 harrowing days on a drifting life raft before reaching land. The sailor collaborated with Garcia Marquez to produce a series of newspaper articles about the ordeal; those articles eventually became this book, which has been translated into a very readable English by Randolph Hogan.<br />The book is written as the sailor's own first-person narrative. This is truly an amazing tale of endurance under some horrible conditions. Velasco describes his experiences in graphic detail: the harsh weather elements, the disorienting hallucinations, the times of despair. Particularly interesting are his encounters with a variety of marine animals. But it's not all suffering; there are moments of poetic beauty.<br />I've never experienced anything as harrowing as this. But as a U.S. Navy veteran, I can say that Garcia Marquez skillfully captures the wonder that can only be encountered at sea, far from land. An excellent book.	2001-06-08

The stories have been translated from Portuguese into English by Nelson H. Vieira, who also wrote the introduction.<br />Born in eastern Europe, Rawet (1929-84) emigrated to Brazil as a child. Vieira calls him &quot;the proclaimed pioneer of Brazilian-Jewish writing.&quot; Rawet's stories are moody and introspective. His stories often read like extended prose poems, and his language frequently has an odd, almost hypnotic quality.<br />Rawet writes about the immigrant experience, anti-Semitism, family conflict, and other topics. He takes a modern approach to a figure from Jewish folklore in the story &quot;Johny Golem.&quot; Many of his stories are &quot;metafictions&quot; in which the narrator comments on his own work as a storyteller. If you are interested in Jewish literature or Latin American literature, give this short volume a try. I also recommend the novels and short stories of the excellent Brazilian-Jewish author Moacyr Scliar.	2001-06-08

Editors James Grayson Trulove and Il Kim have assembled 30 case studies of homes built between 1996 and 2000. The homes range from a 2,200 square foot residence to mansions of 10,000 and 12,800 square feet. The houses come from locations all over the United States: Lovell, Maine; Duluth, Minnesota; Fayettevile, Arkansas; Seattle, Washington; Tucson, Arizona and many other places.<br />Each case study includes detailed, eye-friendly floor plans, as well as many full-color photographs (both exterior and interior). Other features found in many of the case studies include cross sections, detailed elevations, axonometric drawings, site plans, and other visual supplements. Also included are descriptions of materials used in construction.<br />Although the houses represent a range of design approaches, the overall flavor strikes me as modern. Some of the many highlights include the daring cantilevered elements of the Nomentana Residence; the &quot;Y&quot; House (shaped, unsurprisingly, like the letter &quot;Y&quot;); the Emerson Residence, which beautifully blends traditional-looking shingled gables with some innovative elements; the Townsend Residence, a fantastic, flowing series of interconnected circles and curves; and Ledge House, with its striking blend of rough-looking logs and stone. These are just a few of the amazing sights in this book. I recommend &quot;NAH3&quot; with great enthusiasm.	2001-06-05

According to the introductory note in the Dover edition, the play was first performed in London in 1895. More than a century later, &quot;Importance&quot; is still a sparkling delight. Although I suppose the play is best experienced as a theatrical performance, it also makes a wonderful read.<br />In &quot;Importance&quot; Wilde has fun with the customs and attitudes of well-to-do 19th century English people. As the plot of mistaken identity and romance unfolds, Wilde's characters let loose a string of memorable witticisms and sarcastic comments. One of my favorites: &quot;Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.&quot; Another one: &quot;My duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the smallest degree.&quot;<br />Along the way, Wilde's characters reveal the benefits and drawbacks of being a &quot;Bunburyist&quot; (don't bother looking it up in a dictionary; you have to read the play!). So pour yourself a cup of tea, stuff yourself silly with cucumber sandwiches, and enjoy &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest.&quot;	2001-06-05

As the title indicates, this book focuses on the other animals that inhabited the world of the dinosaurs. The book is divided into three sections. The first is devoted to pterosaurs (flying reptiles), the second to marine reptiles, and the third to a variety of other creatures (mammals, flightless birds, and mammal-like reptiles).<br />The large, full-color illustrations include contributions by a variety of different artists. Many of the paintings are exciting action shots showing these creatures hunting, flying, and engaging in other activities.<br />Creatures depicted include the Quetzalcoatlus (a pterosaur whose wingspan could reach 40 feet), the large-eyed opthalmosaurus (an aquatic lizard), the dinornis (an ostrich-like giant bird), the procoptodon (a giant kangaroo), the woolly rhinoceros, and other marvelous creatures. This is a book that is both fun and educational.	2001-06-04

Washington, is an impressive volume. This book brings together essays, speeches, sermons, interviews, and excerpts from King's books. Together, these many documents offer insights into the life and philosophy of a giant of the civil rights movement in the United States.<br />The book includes the &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, the letter from Birmingham jail, the &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, and more. There are even fascinating transcripts from two television appearances.<br />This is a thought-provoking collection. I was fascinated by King's strong critique of that part of the white Christian establishment which opposed his movement. It is also intriguing to read that, apart from the Bible, King would choose Plato's &quot;Republic&quot; if he were to be marooned on the proverbial desert island with only one book. Also noteworthy is the emergence of King's multi-faith, global vision of humanity.<br />This is an important volume for those interested in African-American studies, 20th century U.S. history, or progressive currents in Christian theology. But more than that, &quot;A Testament of Hope&quot; is truly a testament for all people.	2001-06-01

Jennifer Dussling's text is accompanied by Peter Church's charming full-color illustrations. Together, these collaborators explain the story behind the stone gargoyles that can be seen high up on many buildings.<br />The book explains the practical function of the gargoyles (to drain water from buildings). The book also explains how a stone carver creates a gargoyle, and illustrates various types of gargoyles. The illustrations are particularly pleasing, as are the Celtic-looking design borders that are used on the pages. A must-have for kids with an interest in the topic.	2001-05-25

This volume reprints plates from &quot;Scientific American--Architects and Builders Edition,&quot; originally appearing from 1885 to 1894.<br />The book contains floor plans and elevations of both stand-alone houses and connected homes. If you love the fanciful vocabulary of Victorian architecture, you will find all of your favorite features on display here: eyebrow dormers, circular towers, covered piazzas, cantilevered balconies, complex roof lines, clustered fireplaces, Palladian windows, and much, much more.<br />The only drawback to the book is that some house elevations are not accompanied by floor plans; a few others are only accompanied by the plan of a single floor. But overall, this is a richly detailed celebration of some truly beautiful homes. If you are a student of Victorian home architecture, this book is a must-have.	2001-05-23

The Dover edition contains an English translation of the play.<br />&quot;Hands Around&quot; is a cycle of ten dialogues, each of which is linked to the previous and following dialogue through one or the other speaker. Thus, &quot;The Girl of the Streets and the Soldier&quot; is followed by &quot;The Soldier and the Parlor-Maid,&quot; which is in turn followed by &quot;The Parlor-Maid and the Young Man,&quot; etc. The couple in each dialogue is about to have, or has just had, a sexual encounter.<br />Through his characters, the Vienna-born Schnitzler holds up a harsh mirror to the dishonesty, hypocrisy, and loneliness of life. There are some passages of truly dark cynicism. Consider this statement of &quot;the Count&quot; to &quot;the Actress&quot;: &quot;Happiness? There really is no such thing as happiness. All the things that people talk about most, don't exist... for instance, love.&quot;<br />Schnitzler paints a rather bleak portrait of human nature. His characters' disturbing inner lives are ironically complemented by surroundings that are either sadly shabby or elegantly decadent. Overall, &quot;Hands Around&quot; is a fascinating, if uneven, work of European theater.	2001-05-23

While the speech seems a bit short to justify publication as an independent book (the text of the speech does not even take up 11 pages), this is still an admirable work by a great writer.<br />Morrison's topics in this speech are the joys and struggles of the reading/writing life. She recalls two very different individuals. The first is a student from a privileged background who had never learned &quot;to be alone with a book he was not assigned to read, a book on which there was no test,&quot; and who had to force himself to develop this skill. The second individual is a woman living in a country where women who write &quot;against the grain&quot; face terrible persecution.<br />Ultimately, Morrison celebrates the efforts of the book world to make it possible for all &quot;to experience one's mind dancing with another's&quot; through the act of reading. This small book is a must for admirers of Morrison, and should be of value to all who have a commitment to the interlocking worlds of reading and writing.	2001-05-22

Frazer Smith, is an informative celebration of the home architecture of the southern United States. This volume is actually an unabridged reprint; the book was originally published in 1941 with the title &quot;White Pillars: Early Life and Architecture of the Lower Mississippi Valley Country.&quot; The book includes a foreword by Leicester B. Holland.<br />The book contains drawings and floor plans of many historic homes. These visual elements are accompanied by a generous text. Smith not only profiles important homes, but also illustrates the evolution of the southern home from a single one-room cabin into &quot;dogtrot&quot; homes, and eventually into larger structures.<br />Some of the homes presented in the book are Cragfont (1820) of Tennessee, with its impressive second-floor ballroom; Andrew Jackson's &quot;the Hermitage&quot; (1831); the Forks of Cypress (1820), an Alabama house with a 2-story wrap-around portico; and the Walter place (1855), a Mississippi home with twin octagonal towers.<br />Unfortunately, a perspective drawing and floor plans are not included for every house presented in the book. Also, an unpleasant racist subtext shows up at points in the book. Holland's foreword notes that the book &quot;is a survey of the habitations of man of the Caucasian race [...] of the south.&quot; Elsewhere in the book are offhand or patronizing references to &quot;niggers,&quot; &quot;darkies,&quot; and an &quot;old Mammy.&quot;<br />Since this book is an historic reprint, I believe that these racist remarks should be placed in proper context (but not ignored or excused). But if you want to see the majestic Greek-inspired pillars, covered porches, imposing staircases, and other elements that characterize classic southern architecture, check out this book.	2001-05-14

The anthology includes the work of authors from Argentina, Guatemala, Uruguay, Brazil, Mexico, and a number of other countries. All of the material is presented in English translation.<br />Like most anthologies, &quot;Echad&quot; is a mixed bag. I found the excerpts from longer works to be somewhat unsatisfying. But the stand-alone pieces include some truly outstanding selections. Some of the best include Victor Perera's stunning autobiographical essay, &quot;Growing Up Jewish in Guatemala&quot;; Diego Vega's unsettling short story, &quot;The Stutterer's Suicide and the Psychiatrist's Dream&quot;; Cesar Tiempo's ironic poem, &quot;A Series of Verses to the Venerable Ancient...&quot;; and Yaacov Hasson's fascinating essay about the Jewish presence in the Peruvian Amazon.<br />The authors in this collection deal with many topics, in a variety of genres.

The authors here represent a number of English-speaking Caribbean nations: Jamaica, Trinidad, Guyana, Belize, Antigua, and St. Lucia. These stories capture the linguistic, religious, racial, and political complexity of this region.<br />Some of the most memorable selections include the following: Opal Palmer Adisa's &quot;Duppy Get Her,&quot; which makes use of local supernatural beliefs and vernacular language; Neil Bissoondath's &quot;Insecurity,&quot; an ironic tale about the international economic intrigues of a Hindu businessman in the Caribbean; and Rooplall Monar's &quot;Bahadur,&quot; a humorous tale written all in vernacular. But my favorite in the collection is Ian McDonald's &quot;The Duel in Mercy Ward,&quot; a funny and moving tale about the relationship between two elderly men--one a Christian of black African heritage, the other a Hindu of Asian Indian ancestry--in a hospital ward.<br />The brief author biographies at the end of the book include some bibliographical resources for interested readers. Overall, &quot;Caribbean New Wave&quot; is a good book for those who are interested in exploring the fiction that has come out of the English-speaking Caribbean.	2001-05-13

The book has been translated from Portuguese into English by Eloah F. Giacomelli.<br />The stories in this book contain elements of the absurd and the fantastic. The title story involves a Russian Jewish immigrant community in Brazil--a community which may have found its messiah. &quot;The Scalp&quot; is a creepy tale of vanity and violence. And &quot;The Offerings of the Dalila Store&quot; is an odd exploration of lust and commerce.<br />The real masterpiece in this collection is the novelette entitled &quot;The Short-Story Writers.&quot; This is a brilliant &quot;metafiction&quot; about a short story writer who is writing a short story entitled &quot;The Short-Story Writers.&quot; The narrator documents the quirks and struggles of his fellow short story writers. This is a delightful piece, full of jokes and weirdness. Like the film &quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; this long story takes a playfully surreal approach to exploring the role of the artist in society.<br />This collection has been reprinted in its entirety in &quot;The Collected Stories of Moacyr Scliar,&quot; together with more than 100 other pieces. Scliar is one of the most magical voices in Latin American literature, and his stories deserve a wide audience.	2001-05-12

My first experience of Lee Krasner came through the film &quot;Pollock,&quot; a biographical drama about Krasner's husband and fellow artist, Jackson Pollock. I was so impressed by Marcia Gay Harden's passionate portrayal of Krasner in the film that I sought out more information about Krasner, and found Hobbs' book.<br />This book is filled with full-color reproductions of many of Krasner's paintings. She brought something truly special to the abstract expressionist movement. Her work seems to evoke both the technological energy of an urban environment, as well as primal biological power.<br />The book also has many wonderful photographs of Krasner at many stages in her life. In his text, Hobbs discusses such subjects as the influence of Krasner's Russian Jewish heritage upon her work. This is a visually striking and thought-provoking book. My suggestion? Read the book, and see the movie &quot;Pollock.&quot;	2001-05-12

Clarke, is a science fiction novel with a truly epic scope and vision. This classic blew my mind when I first read it many years ago.<br />In the novel, the people of Earth witness the arrival of the Overlords, a highly advanced extraterrestrial species. The Overlords establish a seemingly benevolent rule over the comparatively primitive humans. But these powerful aliens remain shrouded in mystery. What is their ultimate agenda? Ultimately, the novel reveals the ultimate destiny of the human species.<br />&quot;Childhood's End&quot; has some almost Lovecraftian touches of terror and mystery. But on the whole I find the novel to be mind-expanding, and oddly inspiring. And the Overlord named Karellen is, to me, one of the most enduring creations in all of science fiction. This book is essential reading for serious readers of science fiction.	2001-05-11

The colorful illustrations have a soft, gentle quality to them. Another nice touch is the fact that the artwork depicts people of various racial/ethnic characteristics.<br />The educational value of the book is enhanced by a word list at the end.

Author Lenore Look includes a short &quot;Author's Note&quot; in which she reveals that the story was inspired by the life of her own immigrant grandmother. Look's well-written text is nicely complemented by the colorful illustrations of Stephen T. Johnson. Johnson's lovely artwork is realistic, yet with a slightly hazy quality--as if seen through the mists of memory.<br />Katie, the narrator of the story, recalls a day in which she accompanied her grandmother, called &quot;GninGnin,&quot; to the crab processing plant where she works. Katie gains a greater appreciation for her grandmother's hard work, personal sacrifice, and dignity. A nice added touch is a glossary of Chinese terms used in the book.<br />This is a truly universal story about the bond between a grandparent and grandchild. But be warned: the graphic descriptions of crabs being cracked open for meat will surely nauseate some vegetarians, and upset those sympathetic to animal rights.	2001-05-09

I personally found that many of his poems employ a simplicity of language that is weighty with metaphysical import; in that way, Teillier's work reminds me of the poetry of Stephen Crane, another 19th century United States writer.<br />The poems in this volume often deal with the changing seasons, nature, and rural scenes. The poems also frequently deal with words and language. Teillier often seems to find human language insufficient to express the deeper truths of the universe: &quot;Words are nothing / beside the leaf that comes to life when it passes before your face&quot; (from &quot;Story of the Afternoon&quot;).<br />His poetry frequently has a stark, eery beauty to it. His imagery is often quite striking. Consider this address to snow (from &quot;Night Snow&quot;): &quot;What fingers drop you, / pulverized skeleton of petals?&quot; Those interested in Latin American literature or contemporary poetry should listen to the voice of Jorge Teillier.	2001-05-07

Grossman was one of the many individuals who suffered under Nazi rule before and during World War II. Using his camera, he carefully documented the lives of the Jews who were confined by the Nazis to the Lodz ghetto.<br />Grossman's photographs in this book capture many haunting images: the despairing faces of the trapped people, two children harnessed like animals to a cart, people waiting on a bread line. But the fact that Grossman's stark visual testament survived the Holocaust is ultimately inspiring. This is an important book for teachers and parents to share with young readers.	2001-05-07

The publishers have wisely chosen to make this a truly inclusive photographic essay; we thus get pictures of animals some might consider creepy along with the more stereotypically &quot;cute&quot; baby animals.<br />The book is full of marvelous images: a baby kangaroo peeking out of its mother's pouch, kittens nursing, baby turtles hatching, ghostly white baby scorpions riding the back of their mother, a baby orangutan sheltered in its mother's arms, and more. Other animal babies pictured include piglets, tadpoles, a ladybug larva, a baby white tiger, king penguin chicks, a young caiman, and many, many more. This is a visually impressive book for home, classroom and library.	2001-05-05

Jonathan London's compassionate and easy-to-read text blends perfectly with the majestic illustrations by Jon Van Zyle. Together, they tell the story of a baby sperm whale's life with her marine community.<br />The book is full of memorable images: the adult whales protecting the baby from orcas, the mother whale battling a giant squid, and mother and baby simply frolicking in their ocean habitat. Van Zyle's illustrations (most of which stretch across two-page spreads) are superb; Van Zyle is especially adept at capturing the marvelous play of light in the water. &quot;Baby Whale's Journey&quot; is educational, artistically impressive, and emotionally satisfying.	2001-05-04

The book has been translated from Portuguese into a very readable English by Eloah P. Giacomelli. This novel tells the life story of Raquel Szenes, a girl who is born into a Hungarian Jewish family that has emigrated to Brazil in search of a better life.<br />Scliar narrates both the events of Raquel's life, as well as the inner world of her troubled dreams and fantasies. Many of Raquel's inner and outer struggles involve coming to terms with her Jewish identity. Early in the book, she deals with the complexity of dealing with being a Jewish student at a Catholic school. As she matures into a young woman, we accompany her on her quest for love, friendship, and sexual fulfillment. &quot;The Gods of Raquel&quot; is not Scliar's best work, but it is still a fascinating and valuable glimpse into Brazilian Jewish life.	2001-05-03

Giacomelli (who also translated Scliar's monumental &quot;Collected Stories&quot;). &quot;Max&quot; tells the story of Max Schmidt, who is born in Germany in 1912, the son of a furrier. The novel tells of Max's coming of age and his emigration to Brazil.<br />Max's life story is structured around his encounters with three big felines: a stuffed tiger in his father's shop, a jaguar, and an onca (a Brazilian wildcat). I don't want to reveal too much about the novel's quirky plot. I will just say that Max gets into many remarkable situations: comic, frightening, erotic, and/or absurd.<br />Much of the story takes place under the specter of World War II and the Nazis, and other elements of the novel tap into the myth of the Americas as a new world of opportunity. Scliar also refers more than once to the work of Jose de Alencar, the 19th century Brazilian writer who created a romantic, idealized portrait of the relationship between Native Americans and Europeans. Scliar seems to be ironically commenting on the work of this literary predecessor.<br />&quot;Max and the Cats&quot; is a weird, wonderful triumph for Moacyr Scliar. Combining elements of mystery, realism, and the fantastic, this novel is an excellent example of Scliar's uniquely delightful voice.	2001-05-03

The book combines a simple text with many full-color photographs, and also includes non-photographic illustrations by Colin Newman. This book focuses on the sockeye salmon.<br />The book begins with a female salmon who has laid her eggs. We see the tiny salmon embryos in their transparent eggs. The book follows the salmon through their entire life cycle. Other helpful features of the book include a glossary, an index, a map showing the habitat and migratory routes of the sockeye salmon, and a diagram showing each part of a salmon's external body and its function. Overall, a good educational resource.	2001-05-03

It is basically a one-woman show; the only other character besides Miss Margarida is a non-speaking student. &quot;Miss Margarida's Way&quot; was staged in San Francisco in 1977, with Michael Learned in the title role; this was followed later that year by a New York production featuring Estelle Parsons.<br />In book form, the play is accompanied by an introductory article by Mel Gussow (the article originally appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on July 24, 1977). Gussow recalls conversations with playwright Athayde and star Parsons. Gussow notes that the play was banned, and then censored, in Brazil, but also enjoyed great international success.<br />In the play, Miss Margarida is a teacher who addresses the audience as if it were her class. Miss M is truly a monstrous creation: she screams profanities and homophobic slurs at her class, makes inappropriate sexual comments, and frequently threatens students with violence. Her monologue is grotesque, absurd, frightening, unsettling, pathetic, and sometimes funny. She demands that the class memorize her motto: &quot;The deserving ones, who are they? They are those who obey.&quot;<br />Miss Margarida could be seen as a metaphor for any authority figure or institution: religious, military, academic, or political. The play is a brilliant exploration of the abuse of power, and of the psychology of those individuals who engage in such abuse.	2001-05-03

A gay, Colombian-born poet/novelist/translator/nonfiction writer who lives in the United States and writes in both English and Spanish, Manrique brings both passion and a complex perspective to his work. &quot;Tarzan / My Body / Christopher Columbus&quot; is a fine collection of Manrique's poetry.<br />This book is actually three volumes in one. &quot;My Body&quot; is a bilingual collection of his poetry, with his Spanish original on every even-numbered page and the English translation on each odd-numbered page. The poems in &quot;My Body&quot; had previously been published as a separate volume in Colombia in 1999 (as noted in the acknowledgments at the end of the book). &quot;Tarzan&quot; is a collection of poems written in English. And &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot; is a long poem about the final days of the iconic explorer; like &quot;My Body,&quot; this appears in bilingual format. The translations have been done by Margaret Sayers Peden and Edith Grossman. In addition, the late Reinaldo Arenas, the great Cuban-born writer who lived his final years in the U.S., contributed an introduction to the &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot; section of the book.<br />The description of the book may sound complicated, but Manrique's beautiful poetry speaks with clarity and directness. His subjects include gay life and sexual awakening, bilingualism, Latin America, New York City, and more. Many of his poems pay tribute to the work and legacies of writers who have had an impact upon him: Emily Dickinson, Stephen Crane, Manuel Puig, Walt Whitman, and others.<br />Some of his best poems include the following: &quot;Inscriptions from a Lost Tablet,&quot; in which a concubine from the ancient court of Tiglath-Pileser III speaks; &quot;Poem for Matthew Shepard,&quot; a beautiful tribute to the young gay man who was brutally murdered in 1998; and &quot;Al Was from Alabama,&quot; a moving poem about a man dying of AIDS-related complications. But perhaps my favorite lines come from &quot;Train Trip at Nightfall&quot;: &quot;Like smoky honey / night spills over the countryside.&quot;<br />&quot;Tarzan / My Body / Christopher Columbus&quot; is a complex and rewarding work of literature. Manrique's voice is earthy and compassionate, attentive to the world around him, and always striving towards transcendence. Those who are interested in Latin American literature, gay studies, bilingualism, or contemporary poetry should explore this book, and other works by Jaime Manrique.poem about a man dying of AIDS-related complications.

The text has been translated from Portuguese into English by Margaret A. Neves. This brilliant fantasy describes the life of Guedali Tartakovsky, who is born to a Russian Jewish family that has emigrated to Brazil. The family is shocked when, at the baby's birth, they discover that he is a centaur: a being who is human from the waist up, but who possesses a horse's four-legged body below.<br />The novel's hero thus enters the world marked as an outsider. As his life unfolds, we see his quest to educate himself, to embrace his Jewish identity, to experience sex, to find love, and ultimately to determine his place in the world. Along the way are many stunning surprises--for both Guedali and the reader.<br />&quot;Centaur&quot; seems to me to exemplify the concept of &quot;magical realism.&quot; The book deftly blends elements of fantasy, science fiction, and social satire. Scliar explores many types of relationship: between European and Native American, Jew and Gentile, man and woman, parent and child. This is a deeply moving, truly brilliant novel by one of the most extraordinary voices in Latin American literature.	2001-05-01

Directed towards younger readers, the book combines a simple text with plentiful full-color photographs. Animals described include koalas, bilbies, Tasmanian devils, and many others.<br />The book contains many memorable images: a baby wallaby peeking out from the safety of his mother's pouch, a platypus swimming underwater, a thorny devil lizard trekking across the red sand, fairy penguins congregating by the seashore, and more.

This book brings together all 203 known poems by de Burgos, who was born in Puerto Rico in 1914 and died in New York City in 1953. This is a bilingual edition, with the author's Spanish poems paired with the English translations by Jack Agueros. Agueros also compiled this volume, and wrote a fascinating introduction.<br />De Burgos writes about politics, nature, inner emotions, and the poet's vocation. She often advocates Puerto Rican independence, but her political ideas also encompass a vision that is pan-American, and even global. She pays tribute to a number of iconic figures from Latin American culture: Pedro Albizu Campos, Jose Marti, Simon Bolivar, and Jose de Diego.<br />Much of her work has a surreal, hypnotic quality. She often uses startling, Daliesque language that is rich in images from the natural world. Her love poetry ranges from the melancholy to the ecstatic. Her voice is often paradoxical, often mystical--at times she reminds me of Emily Dickinson. One of my favorite romantic lines comes from poem #63, &quot;Inward Song&quot;: &quot;Don't remember me! Feel me! / A nightingale has us in his throat.&quot;<br />In poem #71, &quot;My Road Is Space,&quot; de Burgos writes, &quot;I am the dancing imbalance of the stars.&quot; This is a good image to apply to her poetry: celestial, joyous, with its own inner logic. All who love Latin American literature or 20th century poetry should explore the bountiful &quot;Song&quot; of Julia de Burgos.	2001-04-29

These novels are the work of Severo Sarduy, the Cuban-born writer who left his homeland for France in 1960. This volume is an English edition, translated by Suzanne Jill Levine, with an introduction by James McCourt. Each novel is an elegantly ornate piece of prose; however, in each novel, the ebullient wordplay seems to overwhelm the basics of plot and characterization.<br />The title character of &quot;Cobra&quot; is a performer in the &quot;Lyrical Theater of Dolls&quot;; Cobra undergoes a torturous physical transformation in the course of the story. The novel also takes us into the world of a gang whose members have names like Scorpion, Tiger, and Totem. The equally bizarre &quot;Maitreya&quot; is a story about Buddhism and sex, among other things.<br />Sarduy's prose is, at times, witty, outrageous, grotesque, luxurious, hallucinatory, and/or sexually explicit. He occasionally throws in sarcastic messages to the reader in parodic footnotes.... The plots (or lack thereof) did not engage me, and I found the characters difficult to connect with. Nevertheless, adventurous readers may find these novels worthwhile; they are certainly remarkable works of 20th century fiction.	2001-04-29

Peron, who served as First Lady of Argentina before her untimely death in 1952, was one of the most intriguing women of the 20th century. &quot;In My Own Words: Evita&quot; contains an English translation of a document (entitled &quot;My Message&quot;) that claims to be Evita's deathbed testament.<br />In addition to this document (which has been translated from Spanish by Laura Dail), the book also contains several other components: a 46-page introduction by Joseph A. Page; an account of an interview with Juan Jiminez Dominguez, who was an aide to Evita in her final days (the account is written by Alberto Schprejer); a collection of black-and-white photographs from Evita's life and career; a few facsimile pages from the contested manuscript; and a chronology of Evita's life.<br />As Page notes, the authenticity of the document has been contested. Was it really dictated by Evita? How much of it is reliable? We may never know. But if it is authentic, it affords a fascinating window into the mind of this extraordinary woman. The document is largely a single-minded defense of Peronism, the political philosophy of Evita's husband, Argentine President Juan Peron. The document speaks of &quot;the absolute truth of Peronism&quot; with a sort of religious fervor. Also interesting is the document's support for a revolutionary, socially-conscious Christianity; if the document is authentic, then Evita could be seen as a forerunner of Latin American liberation theology.<br />The document's weakness is the fact that it seems to be more a political treatise than a true personal testament. But the document, Page's introduction, and the other materials in this book are still very interesting. Eva Peron is a true international cultural icon, and those who have been captured by her spell should explore this controversial, intriguing book.	2001-04-28

The book has been edited by John King, who also translated these essays into English. Vargas writes about politics, literature, popular culture, the writer's vocation, and other topics. His moods vary greatly throughout the book: outraged, annoyed, sentimental, exasperated, and enthralled.<br />The book is filled with fascinating insights and memories. It is fascinating, for example, to read how Vargas Llosa's first novel was burned and denounced. He frequently attacks Cuban leader Fidel Castro. One of the best selections, &quot;The Story of a Massacre,&quot; tells of the tragic slaying of a group of journalists; this piece takes us into the worlds of the Shining Path guerrillas and the Iquichano Indians.<br />Another excellent selection is &quot;My Son the Rastafarian,&quot; about his son's conversion to the Rastafarian religion while staying at an English school. Many of Vargas Llosa's essays explore the lives and work of other writers: William Faulkner, Doris Lessing, Julio Cortazar, Ernest Hemingway, and others. And there are a few weird surprises, like his essay on Lorena Bobbitt, the woman who cut off her husband's penis.<br />In an essay on Hemingway, Mario Vargas Llosa writes, &quot;The condition of the writer is strange and paradoxical.&quot; He adds that the writer needs to &quot;feed the beast within which enslaves him.&quot; Vargas Llosa has been feeding his own &quot;beast&quot; for a long time now, and the world is a richer place because of this. I highly recommend &quot;Making Waves&quot; to all interested in contemporary literature and politics.	2001-04-28

This volume has been edited by Marion Freeman, who also wrote the brief but informative biographical introduction. Unfortunately, this is not a bilingual edition; all of the poems are presented in English translation. The translations are by Freeman, Mary Crow, Jim Normington, and Kay Short.<br />Storni's poetry covers a number of topics. Some recurrent subjects include nature, women's issues, family, sorrow, and the urban environment. The specter of violence haunts many of her poems. At times, her sparse but elegant language, combined with a dark tone, reminds me of the work of United States poet Stephen Crane. At other times, the combination of sensuous, startling imagery and emotional nakedness reminds me of the work of Puerto Rican poet Julia de Burgos.<br />Editor Freeman has selected poems from eight of Storni's published volumes, as well as a selection of uncollected poems. One of her most striking poems is &quot;Litany for a Dead Earth,&quot; an apocalyptic vision of a devastated world. Also excellent is &quot;Fog,&quot; which uses fascinating imagery to describe a cityscape. Striking imagery is also used in her &quot;Portrait of Garcia Lorca&quot;: &quot;The Andalusian hills / of his cheekbones / and the trembling valley / of his mouth / are smothered in climbing vines.&quot;<br />In the first poem in this volume, Storni writes, &quot;I am like the she-wolf. / I broke with the pack.&quot; Perhaps this describes her own approach to poetry. At any rate, hers was a remarkable voice, and this is a fine collection of her work. Those interested in Latin American literature or 20th century poetry should seek out this book.	2001-04-27

The collection has been edited by Matilde Neruda and Miguel Otero Silva. The pieces have been translated from Spanish into a wonderfully inviting English by Margaret Sayers Peden.<br />These essays and prose poems cover many topics: Chilean politics, history, and geography; the work of other creative minds, such as poet Walt Whitman, sculptor Alberto Sanchez, and painter Nemesio Antunez; and the art of poetry itself. Many of the selections are important historical documents of Neruda's own political struggles in Chile. Also included is his 1971 Nobel address, &quot;Poetry Shall Not Have Sung in Vain.&quot;<br />I was particularly interested in Neruda's words of praise for other Latin American writers, such as Gabriela Mistral, the &quot;magical&quot; Julio Cortazar, and the &quot;extraordinary&quot; Mario Vargas Llosa. I was moved by his reflection on the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. And I was delighted by such personal memories as a feast of onion dishes on the island of Capri, or an emotional poetry reading in Temuco. There are also moments of humor, such as a priceless anecdote about Federico Garcia Lorca (in the essay &quot;Latorre, Prado, and My Own Shadow&quot;).<br />In the essay &quot;It Is Worthwhile to Have Lived, Because I Have Love&quot; (included in this volume), Neruda declares, &quot;Poetry will water the fields and give bread to the hungry.&quot; The writings of Pablo Neruda, both poetry and prose, have been both bread and water to the souls of people all over the world. His expansive vision truly embraced what he called the &quot;universal struggle&quot; of all women and men. He is an enduring poet/prophet, and &quot;Passions and Impressions&quot; is a magnificent testament.	2001-04-24

The book is an introduction to the life cycle of the ruby-throated hummingbird. Nearly every page contains a beautiful full-color illustration, along with simple text.<br />Himmelman shows us hummingbirds hatching from their eggs and learning to fly. He then follows a hummingbird on his migration south, and shows us the &quot;dance&quot; with which the male hummingbird seeks to attract a mate. Many other aspects of hummingbirds' lives are also portrayed. The book contains moments of both humor and suspense, and ultimately celebrates the beauty and resilience of these amazing creatures.<br />The book's educational value is enhanced by a short but useful glossary. Himmelman clearly has both a knowledge of and affection for hummingbirds, and both of these things come through in this wonderful book.	2001-04-22

A novel written in flowery, poetic language, &quot;Iracema&quot; tells the story of a romance between a South American Indian woman and a white man who has arrived on the continent. The novel has been translated from Portuguese into an elegant English by Clifford E. Landers.<br />As Naomi Lindstrom notes in her foreword to the book, &quot;Iracema&quot; is an anagram for &quot;America.&quot; The story as a whole has a mythic, legendary feel to it. However, the melodramatic tone of much of the story also feels a bit like a contemporary soap opera. The endless pining and melancholy does get a bit tiresome. And the portrayal of Native Americans is problematic; they seem like stereotypically childlike &quot;noble savages.&quot;<br />Still, &quot;Iracema&quot; is a fascinating tale of intercultural relations. The story contains some episodes of real power. And the book is an important document of the literary quest for a Brazilian identity. &quot;Iracema&quot; an essential volume for scholars of South American literature.<br />One final note: for an interesting book that effectively complements &quot;Iracema,&quot; check out &quot;The Vinland Sagas,&quot; translated by Magnus Magnusson and Hermann Palsson. This book contains two sagas about the Norse discovery of North America, and the early encounters between Europeans and Native North Americans. Like &quot;Iracema,&quot; these sagas are landmarks in the literature of contact between alien cultures.	2001-04-18

The collection is translated from Spanish and edited by Luis F. Gonzalez-Cruz and Ann Waggoner Aken. In addition to including an informative general introduction, the editors provide a separate introduction to each piece, as well as an extensive critical bibliography.<br />The three plays in this collection are intriguing pieces of art. &quot;Deviations,&quot; by Julio Matas, is a Faulkneresque family saga of murder-for-hire, infidelity, insanity, conspiracy, lust, and dysfunction. The play takes place on a sugar mill plantation. &quot;The Chinaman,&quot; by Carlos Felipe, uses a play-within-a-play format to explore memory, love, and loss. This play takes place in the home of a diplomat and his mistress. And finally, &quot;An Empty Shoe Box,&quot; by Virgilio Pinera, is a surreal exploration of power, violence, and the allure of ritual.<br />Cuban writers have produced some of the most innovative and powerful literature of the 20th century. &quot;3 Masterpieces&quot; is an excellent taste of Cuba's theater scene.	2001-04-18

This installment begins in the early 1960s, with Maya and her son living in Africa. As a whole, this book is a fascinating meditation on the ties and disjunctions that exist between African-Americans and black Africans.<br />Maya reminisces about working for the University of Ghana, seeking employment as a journalist at the &quot;Ghanaian Times,&quot; and beginning to pick up the Fanti language of Ghana. Particularly fascinating are her memories of the death of W.E.B. DuBois, the visit of Malcolm X to Africa, and her visit to Germany to perform in a production of Jean Genet's play &quot;The Blacks.&quot; Angelou's book is both the vibrant record of an extraordinary woman, and an important portrait of Africa at a key era in its modern history.	2001-04-17

Neuman: American icon!	&quot;Mad: Cover to Cover&quot; is a glorious full-color collection of the cover art of &quot;Mad&quot; magazine, from its founding as a comic book in 1952 to 2000. The outrageous covers are accompanied by witty and insightful commentary by Frank Jacobs. Since &quot;Mad&quot; has satirized so many aspects of American popular culture throughout its existence, this book also serves as an ironic look at five decades of United States history.<br />Most of the covers feature Alfred E. Neuman, the goofy red-haired kid who, as the symbol of &quot;Mad&quot; magazine, has become an instantly recognizable (and, dare I say, beloved?) cultural icon in his own right. We see, over the years, the many crazy incarnations of Alfred: on Mount Rushmore, as Baby New Year, as Batman's Robin, as Uncle Sam, as Michael Jackson, as a Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtle, etc.<br />The running commentary offers fascinating glimpses behind the scenes of &quot;Mad.&quot; Particularly interesting is the story of the long-suppressed cover depicting the first President Bush burning a flag; with the outbreak of the Persian Gulf War, the &quot;Mad&quot; team decided that the incendiary cover was inappropriate for the time.<br />This is truly a marvelous book, full of color, laughs, and memories. Even if you're not a regular reader of &quot;Mad,&quot; you may find this book to be a fascinating mirror on American fads and foibles.	2001-04-17

This volume, by Olivia Gude and Jeff Huebner, is a tribute to the neighborhood public art of the city of Chicago.<br />The book contains a short, but fascinating, history of the mural movement in Chicago. According to the authors, this artistic outpouring began in 1967, when 20 artists began work on the &quot;Wall of Respect,&quot; a pictorial tribute to African-American culture.<br />The book is divided up by neighborhoods. Each section contains a street map, so you can actually use the book to find the murals that have been photographed. 125 murals are pictured in the book. These works of art span many themes and styles. Each photograph is accompanied by essential information about the mural. Also adding to the book's usefulness is a bibliography and a collection of capsule biographies of major artists in the mural movement.<br />It's hard to pick out just a few representative works from this magnificent collection. But my favorites include the following: William Walker's &quot;Childhood Is Without Prejudice,&quot; with its interlocking faces of many races; Christopher Tavares Silva's &quot;Soaring Toward Excellence,&quot; a symbolic, energetic celebration of books and education; Aurelio Diaz' &quot;Latino Youth, Inc.&quot; mural, with its stunning pre-Columbian imagery; and Jeff Zimmerman's &quot;Paid Programming,&quot; a visual satire in which the United States flag is morphed into a bar-code. But these are just a few of the eye-catching works in this book. Explore &quot;Urban Art Chicago,&quot; and feel the rhythms of the people of a great city.	2001-04-17

These are all black-and-white sketches, accompanied by an informative introduction by Carl O. Schniewind. The sketchbook captures Cezanne's monumental human figures, haunting faces, and lyrical landscapes.<br />The really wonderful surprise in the sketchbook is the fact that the artist allowed his young son Paul (b. 1872) to also draw in the sketchbook. Thus we see these charming childish sketches alongside the work of a master artist. When you also consider the many portraits of little Paul by his father in this volume, the &quot;Cezanne Sketchbook&quot; becomes a moving testament to the love that binds a father to his son.	2001-04-17

The book is directed towards younger readers. Andrea Davis Pinkney's text is well complemented by the rich, colorful illustrations by her husband and collaborator, Brian Pinkney.<br />The book begins with Ellington's childhood, and describes his early interest in music and the beginning of his career. The Pinkneys portray his triumph at the Cotton Club, his musical partnership with Billy Strayhorn, and other aspects of his life and career. The book concludes with the triumphant premiere of Ellington's great composition &quot;Black, Brown, and Beige&quot; at Carnegie Hall in New York.<br />One of the aspects of the book that I like best is Andrea Pinkney's use of hip slang that recalls the era being portrayed. Example: &quot;Yeah, those solos were kickin'. Hot-buttered bop, with lots of sassy-cool tones.&quot; And Brian Pinkney's illustrations combine vibrant color with an appealing &quot;antiqued&quot; look. Overall, an excellent educational book for young readers.	2001-04-11

It brings together a number of Warhol's works of visual art, done in various media, together with quotes from some of his writings. As the title indicates, the illustrations and text all have a Christmas theme.<br />Some of the illustrations are black-and-white, but most are in vibrant color. Warhol uses Santas, Christmas trees, presents, angels, poinsettias, and other motifs. The artwork as a whole is playful and charming. The quotes are fun too. A typical Warholism: &quot;Big smiles make a party better because they're energy.&quot; A supplement at the end of the book gives the date and medium for each work of art--a definite plus for serious Warhol scholars!<br />I have to admit, I'm known as my family's &quot;Scrooge&quot; (doesn't every family have one?) around the holiday season. But Andy Warhol's &quot;Ho, Ho, Ho!&quot; even appealed to me. Even if you don't celebrate Christmas, you may also be delighted by this whimsical book.	2001-04-11

Although the jacket of the book describes &quot;Family Tree&quot; as a &quot;novel,&quot; the book in fact seems to incorporate elements of family history, ethnic history, and autobiography. It is primarily written in the form of a conversation between the author/narrator and her parents, a Jewish couple who emigrated from the Ukraine to Mexico. The book has been translated into a very readable English by Susan Bassnett, and contains many delightful family photographs.<br />&quot;The Family Tree&quot; offers the reader a fascinating window into the lives of the Jewish immigrant community in Mexico. Glantz includes many fascinating anecdotes, such as being treated for head lice as a child, or being temporarily &quot;converted&quot; to Christianity by her neighbors. Her parents also recall the threat of anti-Semitic violence in both Europe and Mexico. Also, the book is peppered with interesting pop culture references: Flash Gordon, Greta Garbo, King Kong, Don Ameche, etc.<br />I was most fascinated, however, by the parents' recollections of the Yiddish literary and theater scene in Mexico. These portions of the book underscore the importance of Yiddish as a Jewish cultural language. Overall, &quot;The Family Tree&quot; is a wonderful book, rich in tragedy, humor, and history.	2001-04-11

Thanks to a series of successful books and videos, Winnie the Pooh and his playmates in the 100 Acre Wood have become some of the best-loved characters in children's entertainment. &quot;Pooh Unplugged,&quot; by Karen Finley, is a merciless satire of these characters and their world. Pooh and company walking around with graphically portrayed penile erections, wearing bondage gear, and making sexual advances towards each other--this is typical of Finley's work in this book.<br />I have to admit, I found a few of the drawings briefly amusing. But on the whole, I found &quot;Pooh Unplugged&quot; to be a cheesy and crude undertaking. Finley's &quot;satire&quot; is, in my opinion, simplistic and uninspired.<br />I should note that I do defend Finley's right as an artist to make a parody of anything she wants to mock. But I don't see much of a point to this weak effort, whose main goal seems to be to merely shock.	2001-04-11

This is a beautiful book, full of energy and joy. Haring's images have a uniquely funky poetry to them. Whether he's creating a robot DJ, whimsical animals, or tribal/iconic looking humanoid figures, Haring imprints his distinctive style upon all.<br />My only problem with the book involves the following editorial note on the publication data page: &quot;The Keith Haring artwork in this book has been reproduced faithfully; however, the colors of some works have been altered.&quot; So. . . which colors have been altered, and why? I'm of the opinion that you don't mess with the work of a master artist unless you have a very good reason, and the editors of this book fail to fully explain this matter of alteration.<br />But despite this matter, Haring's vision shines through. He wrote, &quot;The freedom of the artist is symbolic of the human spirit in all mankind.&quot; Haring's appeal transcends all barriers of difference, and &quot;Dance&quot; truly speaks to that universal human spirit.	2001-04-11

This volume focuses on Wright's Prairie Houses. As Lind notes, the Prairie School of architecture was inspired by the &quot;spacious, horizontal feeling&quot; of the American prairie. This book pays particular attention to several of Wright's Prairie masterpieces built between 1900 and 1908.<br />This book shares many of the admirable characteristics of other volumes in the series: a profusion of superb full-color photographs (both interior and exterior), Lind's interesting text, illuminating sidebar quotes from Wright and others, and a brief but useful bibliography. Houses pictured include the Bradley House of Kankakee, Illinois; the Darwin Martin House of Buffalo, New York; the Stockman House of Mason City, Iowa; and many more.<br />The only flaw in the book is the lack of any legible floor plans. Although floor plans are not a focus of this series as a whole, author Lind does call attention to the distinctive features of the Prairie House floor plans several times in the text. Thus, one or two representative plans would have really enhanced this volume. Actually, one floor plan is included, but it is used merely as a decorative background element: the plan is printed in a pale blue ink and has text superimposed on top of it, so it is not very legible. This matter aside, however, this is a fine volume in an excellent series.	2001-04-10

A key image from the play occurs early on, when one character talks about the experience of lifting up a stone and seeing the slime, fungus, and worms underneath. &quot;Fefu&quot; is about peeling back the gentile facades of life and seeing the unpleasant decay that lies beneath.<br />The play, which has an all-female cast, takes place at an elegant New England country house where the characters of the title have assembled. As the women gather to talk in various groupings, Fornes dissects such topics as gender roles, marriage, and educational conventions. Stirrings of insanity, violence, heterosexual frustration, and repressed lesbian desire contribute to the play's unsettling atmosphere. Overall, a memorable work from a grand master of contemporary theater.	2001-04-06

This volume contains the features that generally characterize the series as a whole: Lind's concise text, many excellent full-color photographs of both building interiors and exteriors, interesting sidebar quotes from Wright and others, and a brief but informative bibliography.<br />This book profiles many of Wright's most noteworthy public buildings: the Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois; the Johnson Wax Building in Racine, Wisconsin; Beth Sholom Synagogue in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania; the Guggenheim Museum in New York City; and more.<br />The many photographs effectively capture the beauty and revolutionary boldness of Wright's architectural vocabulary. The buildings range from structures that look like Mayan temples, to structures that look like extraterrestrial spaceships, to structures that mirror forms from the natural world. Read the book and appreciate the genius of Frank Lloyd Wright.	2001-04-06

Hamer (1917-1977), a poor Mississippi sharecropper, was a driving force in the struggle to secure voting rights for poor African-Americans. This book, directed towards younger readers, effectively tells her story.<br />Colman combines a straightforward text with many historic photographs. The book begins with the dramatic story of the 1964 Democratic Convention, during which Hamer took a stand against the suppression of black people within the Mississippi Democratic establishment. An interesting supplement within the text describes Hamer's influence on singer/songwriter Bernice Reagon. Another such supplement discusses the &quot;freedom songs&quot; that inspired civil rights heroes like Hamer.<br />Hamer's story is an important one, and more children and adults, regardless of race, should be made aware of her achievements. My thanks to Penny Colman for this well-done book.	2001-04-05

The book consists of 93 short chapters (two of which are not numbered), together with Crowley's own commentaries on the chapters. It is marvelous that we thus get to hear Crowley's unique voice speaking in two complementary modes: the revelatory and the analytical.<br />The 93 chapters take a number of forms: poetry, parable, aphorism, vision, joke, and pun. There are numerous intriguing references: to the Tarot, the Qabala, astrology, Egyptian mythology, the &quot;Left Hand Path,&quot; Masonry, the Beast of Revelation, sacred geometry, etc.<br />Crowley's writing is often cryptic, often witty, often elegant. The book is also full of memorable quotes. One of my favorites: &quot;I slept with Faith and found a corpse in my arms on awakening; I drank and danced all night with Doubt, and found her a virgin in the morning.&quot;<br />Like the most enduring of occult and freethinking writers, Crowley challenges us to refocus our dulled organs of perception, and to rethink our stale mental conventions. &quot;The Book of Lies&quot; belongs on the shelf with my favorite &quot;alternative scriptures&quot;: William Blake's &quot;Marriage of Heaven and Hell,&quot; the poetry of Stephen Crane, the feminist satires of Luisa Valenzuela, the dark testaments of Anton Szandor LaVey, Ambrose Bierce's &quot;Devil's Dictionary,&quot; the savagely satirical writings of Virgilio Pinera, and more. But even in this company, Crowley is in a class of his own.	2001-04-05

This is Malcolm's life in his own words, as told to Alex Haley (who also wrote a lengthy epilogue to the book). This book is a powerful narrative with a truly epic sweep.<br />The book opens in Omaha, Nebraska, with Malcolm's family being terrorized by the Ku Klux Klan. Malcolm goes on to describe his entry into the seedy New York underworld, and his career as a burglar and illegal drug dealer. After being convicted and imprisoned, he is converted to the pseudo-Islamic sect led by the charismatic Elijah Muhammad. The rest of the book details Malcolm's ultimate disillusionment with the so-called &quot;Black Muslim&quot; sect and his turn towards a more orthodox form of Islam.<br />This book is many things: a political manifesto, a record of spiritual awakening, an intellectual autobiography, and more. I was particularly fascinated by Malcolm's descriptions of the beliefs of the Black Muslim sect, and of his own education via a well-stocked prison library. Ultimately, Malcolm adopts a worldview that transcends racial prejudice and hatred.<br />At times, Malcolm engages in ranting that seems to distract from the overall lucidity of his narrative. In particular, he often expresses anger towards other African-Americans: &quot;Bishop Chickenwings&quot; (his name for certain black Christian ministers), &quot;so-called intellectuals,&quot; &quot;black Ph.D. puppets,&quot; and &quot;fancy bourgeois Negroes.&quot; But such invective should, I believe, be read in proper historical context.<br />Overall, &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; is a powerful, and even inspirational, narrative. For those interested in African-American history or American religious history, this is a vital text.	2001-04-01

This volume is devoted to the various items that went inside the houses designed by Wright. The book reveals Wright to be not only a skilled architect, but also a master of interior design.<br />This book contains many of the praiseworthy features of other volumes in the series: a concise text by Lind, a treasury of wonderful full-color photographs, and an interesting series of sidebar quotes from Wright and others. The book covers many topics: bedroom furniture, dining room chairs, office furniture, lighting fixtures, cut stone decorative panels, and more. Lind also makes mention of some of the craftspeople who collaborated with Wright on these furnishings. Overall, this little book is a fine tribute to the work of an architectural visionary.	2001-03-31

Written a direct and uncomplicated style, this volume opens in 1957, with Maya as a young mother raising her son in California.<br />As the narrative unfolds, Maya moves to New York City, where she becomes involved in the Harlem Writers Guild. The author goes on to describe her experiences in the theater, her involvement in the civil rights movement, and her work as a journalist in Africa.<br />&quot;The Heart of a Woman&quot; is a fascinating evocation of a turbulent era in both American and African history. I was particularly intrigued by the story of Angelou's performance in Jean Genet's play &quot;The Blacks&quot;; Angelou offers some interesting insights into the relationship between artistic and racial issues. For those interested in women's studies, African-American literature, literary autobiography, or mid-20th century American history, this book is an essential text.	2001-03-31

This book has, since its publication, become a beloved contemporary classic of African-American literature.<br />After their parents' separation, young Marguerite (her given name) and her brother, Bailey, are sent to live with their strong-willed grandmother in Stamps, Arkansas, deep in the segregated South. Angelou also describes her time spent with her other grandmother in St. Louis, as well as her young adulthood in San Francisco. The overall time period of the book overlaps that of World War II.<br />&quot;I Know...&quot; offers important insights into the world of racial segregation, and painfully records the toll taken by racism in its various forms. Also powerful and important is Angelou's recollection of surviving a brutal sexual assault when she was a child. Angelou recalls vividly the authors who made an impact on her during her childhood and young adulthood: James Weldon Johnson, Edgar Allan Poe, William Shakespeare, and others. The book concludes with her sexual awakening as a young woman.<br />&quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; is an American classic which has lost none of its power in the 30 years since it first appeared. Angelou's prose is direct and personal, and marked with passages of wit and beauty. For scholars of African-American literature, women's studies, or literary autobiography, this is an essential volume.	2001-03-30

Haring created an instantly recognizable style with his drawings. His portrayals of heart shapes, human shapes, and other elements have both an iconic quality and a life-affirming energy. Many of his drawings combine a mystical feeling with postmodern playfulness.<br />My only reservation about this book involves a note on the page of publication data. It reads, &quot;The Keith Haring artwork in this book has been reproduced faithfully; however the colors of some works have been altered.&quot; Huh? I see no need to change the artist's colors. I think the editors of the book overstepped themselves with that decision. Nevertheless, this book effectively captures the genius of Keith Haring, an artist who continues to inspire people all over the world.	2001-03-30

Houses pictured in the book include the Rosenbaum house, Taliesin West, Fallingwater, and others. Each photo demonstrates Wright's mastery of color, space, form, and light. If you are interested in the work of Wright or in home design in general, you might really enjoy this book.	2001-03-30
2051021:US	51987970	R2FTXSQFLPF771	0380013924	24612273	The Satanic Rituals: Companion to The Satanic Bible	Books	4	32	43	N	N	A fascinating collection of dark rituals	As founding High Priest of the Church of Satan, Anton Szandor LaVey was one of the most remarkable voices in late 20th century religion, and &quot;The Satanic Rituals&quot; is a key text in his body of work. This volume, which is an ideal companion to LaVey's &quot;Satanic Bible,&quot; makes available some rituals for practicing Satanists.<br />LaVey's rituals have an eclectic, even multicultural, flavor. According to him, the rites in this book have French, German, Russian, and Middle Eastern roots. He also includes rituals inspired by the fictional mythology created by H.P. Lovecraft, a writer of distinctive horror fiction. Although mostly geared towards group activities, many of the texts in this book could be adapted to solitary use.<br />The book is not without flaws and inconsistencies. Whereas some of the rituals appear in bilingual format, others contain untranslated foreign language elements. And although bibliographic references are scattered throughout the text, the book as a whole lacks a comprehensive bibliography. Also, some of the rituals seem a bit impractical. The introduction to the &quot;elektrischen Vorspiele,&quot; for example, warns the practitioner of &quot;the danger of serious injury or electrocution&quot;!<br />Despite these drawbacks, this is an intriguing book. Both the rituals and the introductory essays are fascinating. LaVey even suggests appropriate musical accompaniment for these dark rituals. Rites in the book include a version of the legendary Black Mass, the Ceremony of the Stifling Air (inspired by the history of the Knights Templar), and Satanic baptismal rites (both child and adult). If you have a taste for the blasphemous, you'll want a copy of &quot;The Satanic Rituals.&quot;	2001-03-30

In this one, Lind notes that &quot;about one hundred of [his] buildings--one of every five built--have been destroyed&quot; for various reasons. This book celebrates the legacy of these lost treasures.<br />The book combines Lind's concise but informative text with a wealth of historic black-and-white photographs. In addition, the book contains full color photos of preserved portions of these lost buildings. There are also interesting sidebar quotes from Wright and others, as well as a bibliography.<br />Both public buildings and private homes are covered in &quot;Lost Buildings.&quot; Structures pictured in the book include the Larkin Administration Building in Buffalo, New York; the Lake Mendota Boathouse in Madison, Wisconsin; and the Husser House in Chicago, Illinois. Each structure is celebrated with a short history and with photographs.<br />This book, despite its small size, effectively pays tribute to a fascinating body of Wright's work. For those interested in Wright, this mini-book may make a perfect gift.	2001-03-30

Manrique's Spanish poems have been translated into an engaging free verse by Edith Grossman and Eugene Richie. Each two-page spread contains Manrique's Spanish originals on the even-numbered page, with the English version on the odd-numbered page.<br />Manrique writes about a number of subjects: family, childhood, nature, art, Latin American life, and gay love. His poetry is direct and passionate, and is marked by sensuous imagery. Many of the poems seem to be autobiographical in nature.<br />There are many standout poems in this excellent collection. One of my favorites is his beautiful &quot;Ode to  Hummingbird,&quot; which contains these memorable lines: &quot;Others think I'm looking into infinite green; / a hummingbird is only visible to the eyes of love.&quot; The poem &quot;Toadstools&quot; has a wildly mystical flavor. Another poetic triumph is the title poem, a gentle narrative in which an elderly gay man remembers his night of passion with Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca.<br />Much of this book complements Manrique's excellent prose work &quot;Eminent Maricones: Arenas, Lorca, Puig, and Me.&quot; That volume is a blend of autobiography and literary biography, and readers who enjoy &quot;My Night.../Mi Noche...&quot; will probably like &quot;Eminent Maricones&quot; too.<br />I highly recommend &quot;My Night.../Mi Noche...&quot;. If you are interested in Latino/Hispanic studies, gay literature, or contemporary poetry, spend your own night of passion with Jaime Manrique.	2001-03-28

This volume in the series is devoted to Fallingwater, the amazing modern house designed by Wright in 1935 for Liliane and Edgar J. Kaufmann. This is a &quot;mini-book,&quot; but despite its small size, it is an impressive tribute to a landmark of home architecture.<br />Carla Lind's concise but informative text is complemented by many glorious full-color photographs of Fallingwater. There are both exterior and interior shots that capture many of the home's memorable features: the rough stone walls, the cantilevered balconies, the bold use of glass, the remarkable asymmetrical fireplaces, and more. There are also some fascinating black-and-white historical photos.<br />Lind also includes a bibliography and a chronology. The text is further complemented by a series of sidebar quotes from Wright, Edgar Kaufmann Jr., and others.<br />I have visited Fallingwater. It is a stunning architectural achievement which, I think, no book could completely capture. But Carla Lind has done a good job of celebrating the spirit of this remarkable house.	2001-03-28

This volume focuses on a remarkable group of homes designed by Wright between 1917 and 1927.<br />Like other volumes in this series, this book combines a brief but informative text with a wealth of full-color photos. Lind also includes a bibliography, a chronology, black-and-white historical photos, and sidebar quotes from various sources.<br />The photos of the California houses capture many interior and exterior details. These marvelous homes reflect the spirit of the pre-Columbian civilizations of Mexico and Central America; in fact, they look like modern versions of ancient Mayan temples. It is amazing to look at the patterned concrete blocks, the innovative use of glass, and the other distinctive features of these homes.<br />Wright's California homes are majestic, yet inviting buildings that have a timeless beauty and grace to them. This little book is a wonderful tribute to these great homes.	2001-03-28

This book is part of a series of &quot;mini-books&quot; devoted to Wright. But despite the book's small scale (5.25 by 5.25 inches, 57 pages), Lind has packed in a wealth of words and images.<br />The book contains Lind's insightful text, as well as a wealth of illuminating sidebar quotes from Wright and others. There are many detailed, full-color photographs of stunning fireplaces. There is even a delightful historic black-and-white photo of Wright himself playing the piano near one of his fireplaces.<br />Houses represented in the book include the Hollyhock house, the Hanna house, Fallingwater, and many others. Each fireplace is a beautiful work of art which seems like an organic, integral part of the home. This book will surely delight fans of Wright, and of home design in general.	2001-03-27

This volume, which explores Wright's interest in glass, contains many praiseworthy features: Lind's concise yet informative text, a wealth of stunning full-color photographs, fascinating sidebar quotes from Wright and others, and a useful bibliography for further reading.<br />The plentiful photographs truly capture the genius of Frank Lloyd Wright. We can see his bold work with colored glass and geometric patterns in windows of many different shapes and sizes. It's marvelous to see how each glass creation complements the larger architectural space of which it is a part.<br />Houses represented in the book include the Darwin Martin house, the Schaberg house, the Roberts house, and many more. But my favorite photograph is a breathtaking two-page spread of the second Jacobs house. If you love Wright, if you love glass, or if you love the art of home design, you will certainly love this excellent little book.	2001-03-27

Nikola-Lisa, brings together 13 of her classic paintings, along with brief excerpts from the artist's own autobiographical writings. The result is a beautiful tribute to a remarkable artist.<br />The book opens with a great full-color photographic portrait of Grandma Moses at work at her painting table in 1952. A brief but informative biography sets the stage for the treasures that follow.<br />Grandma Moses was a rural New York farm wife for most of her long life, and her paintings reflect this world. Colorful, lively, and rich in detail, these paintings record and celebrate the daily lives of farm communities. We see classic farmhouses, a horse-drawn carriage, children climbing a tree, cows grazing, people engaging in chores, and other sights.<br />Because the book focuses on a year in Grandma's world, the paintings reflect all of the seasons. We see the green fields of springtime, the brilliant foliage of autumn, and the snowy landscapes of winter. &quot;The Year with Grandma Moses&quot; is a wonderful book that captures the spirit of an American creative legend.	2001-03-26

Colin King's humorous, colorful illustrations complement the simple story.<br />In the book, a little boy known simply as &quot;o&quot; rounds up a group of animals, all of whose name's begin with the letter &quot;o&quot;: octopus, otters, ostrich, etc. He takes them home for some play time.<br />Although all of the &quot;o&quot; words in the main story have a short &quot;o&quot; pronunciation, the author includes a supplement of words that begin with an &quot;o&quot; that is pronounced long: okra, opal, ocean, etc. Each word has an accompanying illustration.<br />The author and illustrator do an effective job of focusing on a single letter of the alphabet. This book is both entertaining and educational.	2001-03-24

As in the other books in the series, colorful illustrations complement a simple text.<br />This book is about a multi-ethnic trio of children, each of whom is simply known by a single letter: x, y, and z. Each child takes a box and fills it with one or more items that begin with his or her letter: an x-ray machine, a yo-yo, zebras, etc. Supplemental pages illustrate several more &quot;x,y,z&quot; words: xylophone, yams, yak, zipper, etc.<br />Overall, a well done book. And if your child works his/her way through the entire series, I can recommend the perfect follow-up: &quot;On Beyond Zebra,&quot; by Dr. Seuss.	2001-03-24

The book contains the complete screenplay (in English), a foreword by director Lee, and many interesting notes and sidebars by those who crafted the film.<br />The book is rich in full-color photos that celebrate the sumptuous beauty of Ang Lee's vision. Looking at the book, I gained an increased appreciation for the artistry and attention to detail that went into the design of the costumes, props, and sets for the film. There are many excellent portraits of the film's superb cast, particularly of Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi, Chow Yun Fat, Chang Chen, and Cheng Pei Pei.<br />The sidebars are particularly fascinating. Many of them give insights into Chinese history and culture. One sidebar tells a little about Wang Du Lu, who wrote the novel upon which the script was based; another sidebar explores the relationship between &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; and Ang Lee's 1995 film &quot;Sense and Sensibility.&quot; The other sidebars are similarly informative.<br />This book is a beautiful keepsake that will allow you to relive one of the most enchanting films ever made. Ang Lee, screenwriter James Schamus, and all others who contributed to this book have given a wonderful gift to the film's fans.	2001-03-23

His friend, the man with the yellow hat, has bought him a jigsaw puzzle. But when the accident-prone monkey swallows a piece of the puzzle, he must go to the hospital to get the situation remedied.<br />That's the set-up for &quot;Curious George Goes to the Hospital,&quot; by Margret and H.A. Rey. Like the other volumes in the series, the book is enhanced by engaging artwork and a loveable hero. The book could also be used to help decrease children's fears of hospitals.<br />If the book has a flaw, it's that George continues to engage in disobedient, (unintentionally) destructive, and dangerous antics. And these antics (unlike his swallowing of the puzzle piece) often have no serious consequences. So parents might want to stress to younger readers that all of George's shenanigans are not necessarily fit to be imitated.<br />Nevertheless, &quot;Curious George Goes to the Hospital&quot; is a delightful book. Adults will appreciate some of the clever details and sight gags that enliven the artwork. And of course, what child can resist George? He's a classic character who has stood the test of time.	2001-03-23

In this volume, there's trouble brewing in the Bear family when Brother and Sister Bear start feuding. But, with a little helpful guidance from their caring parents, the sparring siblings learn some life lessons about fighting--and about making up.<br />This book pairs an easy-to-read text with colorful illustrations. These semi-human bears have an amusingly &quot;cartoony&quot; look to them, and the best of the book's illustrations contain delightful details. I especially love the pictures that show the Bears going through their daily routine--eating breakfast, riding the bus to school, etc. I give &quot;The Berenstain Bears Get in a Fight&quot; an enthusiastic recommendation.	2001-03-23

The book has been translated into a highly readable English by Mark Schafer. In &quot;Rene's Flesh,&quot; Pinera tells the story of Rene, a beautiful youth who is heir to his family's messianic political obsessions. The story is full of homoerotic and sadomasochistic images.<br />A good portion of &quot;Rene's Flesh&quot; deals with the main character's experiences at a nightmarish boarding school. The novel includes weird parodies of both Christian iconography and political movements. Grotesque characters have such names as &quot;Ball of Flesh&quot; and &quot;The Skeleton.&quot; An unsettling air of paranoia pervades the book.<br />Although Pinera is a truly original talent, &quot;Rene's Flesh&quot; is reminiscent of the work of some other significant writers. Pinera's portayal of horrific cultic rites is comparable to the work of both J.K. Huysmans and H.P. Lovecraft. His cutting satiric skill calls to mind Ralph Ellison's &quot;Invisible Man.&quot;<br />Those who are fascinated by Pinera's brilliant fiction should check out &quot;Before Night Falls,&quot; the moving memoir by exiled Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas. In that book, Arenas recalls his own relationship with Pinera. Together, Arenas and Pinera represent two of the giants of 20th century Cuban literature, and &quot;Rene's Flesh&quot; is a dark masterpiece.	2001-03-20

Dr. Seuss has created another entertaining children's classic with &quot;Fox in Socks.&quot; The plot is simple: the clever title character dazzles his friend Knox with a series of increasingly complex tongue twisters. Along the way, Seuss reveals a number of fantastic images: a marching band in which all the musicians are pigs, a crow in a top hat, and more.<br />The book even has a touch of science fiction when the Fox introduces Knox to a weird lake of chewing gum-like blue goo. But it's the tongue twisting rhymes that are the central attraction of this book. By the time you get to the &quot;muddle puddle tweetle poodle beetle noodle bottle paddle battle,&quot; you will certainly appreciate Seuss's writerly virtuosity. This is a fun book, and the Fox earns his place alongside Seuss's most memorable characters.	2001-03-14

But the really fun thing about &quot;Little Green...&quot; is the fact that attached to the book is a clear plastic bubble containing seven little green army men, just like those portrayed in the film. Each little soldier is a nicely detailed, three-dimensional toy.<br />I suppose that some parents will hesitate to give their kids a toy that depicts firearms--the little soldiers are armed with a variety of weapons. But that's a choice each parent must make. Personally, I find &quot;Little Green Army Men&quot; to be a delightful complement to one of the best children's films of the 1990s. And for those adults (like myself) who played with our own little green army men as children, this interactive book will bring back some fond memories.	2001-03-14

As the book's subtitle indicates, this work consists of two shorter pieces. The first, &quot;Old Rosa,&quot; has been translated into English by Ann Tashi Slater; the second, &quot;The Brightest Star,&quot; has been translated into English by Andrew Hurley.<br />The first story tells of the family of Old Rosa, a Cuban landowner whose life begins to fall apart under Castro's revolution. As Arenas explores her family and community relationships, he illuminates such issues as racial prejudice, homophobia, and economic conflict. This is a powerful story which skillfully blends elements of hard-core realism with hallucinatory supernatural touches.<br />The second story, &quot;The Brightest Star,&quot; follows the experiences of Old Rosa's son Arturo in a Cuban forced-labor camp. This is a harrowing tale which deals in part with the redemptive power of writing and fantasy.<br />This book is an important piece of 20th century Latin American literature. The only drawback I found as a reader was the fact that each story unfolds as a single unbroken paragraph; this format, although impressive from a technical aspect, gets somewhat tiring after a while. But I still recommend &quot;Old Rosa.&quot; And I also suggest that those who are impressed with Arenas' gifts as a fiction writer also read his remarkable autobiography, &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; (which has been made into a compelling film).	2001-03-01

The book has been translated into English by Dolores M. Koch. In &quot;The Doorman&quot; Arenas tells the story of Juan, a Cuban refugee who takes a job as a doorman in a New York City apartment building. Arenas deftly blends elements of satire, science fiction, fantasy, fable, eroticism, and absurdism as he narrates Juan's remarkable relationships with the building's tenants and their pets.<br />Nothing is off limits in this bizarre comic odyssey. Religious fanaticism, bestiality, political dogmatism, cybernetic reconstruction, and impotence are just a few of the topics skewered by Arenas' savage, yet playful, imagination. In its social scope and satiric incisiveness, the novel is comparable to Ralph Ellison's classic &quot;Invisible Man.&quot; Arenas' strange narrator, who frequently comments on the process of writing, reminds me of the narrator of &quot;The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas,&quot; the great novel by Brazilian author Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis. And other aspects of the novel read like a warped blending of Dr. Seuss, &quot;Charlotte's Web,&quot; and Franz Kafka. But make no mistake: Arenas is a wholly original talent, and &quot;The Doorman&quot; is a unique literary treasure.	2001-03-01

It's been the subject of controversy over her portrayal of black men and her use of black vernacular language; it's been adapted by director Steven Spielberg into a motion picture that's inspired its own controversy; it's had a whole other life as a text used in college courses. But, so many years after its original publication, and after all of the accolades and debates, &quot;The Color Purple&quot; still holds its own as a compelling piece of fiction.<br />&quot;The Color Purple&quot; is written in the form of letters. It opens with a letter to God from Celie, a rural African-American girl who, as she reveals on the first page, is a victim of sexual abuse. As Celie grows into womanhood, Walker paints a fascinating portrait of the community of people who make up Celie's world.<br />&quot;The Color Purple&quot; is, ultimately, about liberation and redemption. Those who believe that this book attacks black men are wrong. This book attacks violence and abuse, and celebrates those--whether victim or victimizer--who are able to break the cycle of abuse and truly grow as human beings. This novel is bold in its exploration of sexuality--in particular, lesbian sexuality--as a potentially liberating force. And Walker also explores the possibility of an alternative spirituality and alternative family structures to heal those who have been damaged by the racist, sexist paradigms of United States society.<br />&quot;The Color Purple&quot; is also about the power of writing. In her long career, Alice Walker has distinguished herself as a writer of poetry, essays, short fiction, and novels. &quot;The Color Purple&quot; is among the best of her many fine literary achievements, and this novel continues to have a vibrant life of its own.	2001-02-09

Children's author/illustrator Byron Barton has retold the tale for the youngest readers in &quot;The Three Bears.&quot; Barton combines a very simple text with brightly colored, yet simple illustrations.<br />I really love Barton's artwork. His illustrations have a deliberately primitive look to them--a style reminiscent of that of folk artist Grandma Moses. His bears are particularly cute--not at all scary. Overall, I recommend this book for families or classrooms with small children, or for adult folklore enthusiasts looking for an enjoyable &quot;coffee table&quot; book.	2001-02-09

The author, who died in 1908, is one of the major figures of 19th century South American literature. &quot;Quincas Borba&quot; is a sort of companion volume to another of the author's novels, &quot;The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas.&quot; While &quot;Quincas Borba&quot; does not, in my opinion, attain the level of literary inventiveness of its companion novel, it is still a fascinating, and ultimately moving, piece of fiction. It has been translated into a smooth English by Gregory Rabassa.<br />&quot;Quincas Borba&quot; tells the story of Rubiao, who inherits a fortune, as well as a pet dog, from the eccentric philosopher Quincas Borba. Curiously, the dog is also named Quincas Borba. The novel follows Rubiao as he attempts to find love and fulfillment in 19th century Brazil.<br />The novel contains many ironic comments on the craft of writing itself, and examines the political, sexual, and economic complexities of Rubiao's world. The author's writing is peppered with intriguing cultural allusions: Poe, Shakespeare's &quot;Othello,&quot; Homer, Mozart, Kant, Dante's &quot;Inferno,&quot; and more.<br />&quot;Quincas Borba&quot; is an effective mix of comedy and tragedy. Machado de Assis writes with both insight into and compassion for the human condition. Those interested in 19th century literature, Latin American studies, or the development of the novel should definitely read this book.	2001-02-09

Much of the story takes place at the Caribbean mansion of white millionaire Valerian Street. Morrison weaves a deliciously nasty psychodrama involving Street, his flaky wife, the Street's black servants, and Jadine, a young black woman who is niece to the servants and who has been educated thanks to Valerian's money. Into this mix Morrison tosses Son, a dreadlocked black man with a dangerous edge.<br />&quot;Tar Baby&quot; is a frequently outrageous satire of racial identity, sexual politics, consumer culture, class consciousness, and family dysfunctionality. Her cast of characters is colorfully warped in an almost Dickensian manner. Particularly interesting is the portrait of Jadine, the black wunderkind beloved by her wealthy white patrons; I think of her as a whorish postmodern parody of early African-American poet Phillis Wheatley.<br />As always, Morrison's writing is marked by passages of poetic power and grace. Check out, for example, this marvelous description of Son's hair: &quot;Wild, aggressive, vicious hair that needed to be put in jail. Uncivilized, reform-school hair. Mau Mau, Attica, chain gang hair.&quot;<br />Ultimately, I read &quot;Tar Baby&quot; as a comic tragedy of people trapped in a complex web of racial, sexual, and economic mythologies. Profane, thought-provoking, ironic, and rich in scathing humor, this novel is ample proof of Toni Morrison's writerly talent.	2001-02-08

Mason retells a classic story from Greek mythology to beginning readers. Her simple prose is accompanied by Susan Swan's spectacular illustrations.<br />The story focuses on Pegasus, the legendary winged horse. The goddess Athena guides Pegasus to join forces with a young prince in order to defeat a monster that has been terrifying the land. Mason thoughtfully provides pronunciation helps for the mythological names.<br />Swan's illustrations really make this book special. Her artwork appears to consist of cut paper collages. These collages are rich in color, texture, and detail. Elegant Greek temple columns, the feathers of Pegasus' wings, the shaggy many of the monster, the rough gray stones around the monster's cave--all these details are rendered with spectacular skill by Swan.<br />My only complaint about the book is the fact that both prince and monster go unnamed (for the record, the prince is Bellerophon, and the monster is the Chimera--I looked the names up to double-check them). But that's a minor complaint. The beauty and excitement of this book make &quot;The Flying Horse&quot; a worthy addition to the classroom or family library.	2001-02-07
2112354:US	51987970	RYR04OJA0M34T	0374521603	407887817	The Pleasure of the Text	Books	5	39	41	N	N	An audacious--and delicious--little book	&quot;The Pleasure of the Text,&quot; by Roland Barthes, is a work of literary and cultural philosophy that actually transcends the genre. The short book consists of a series of &quot;meditations,&quot; many less than a page long, that explore various facets of language and reading. Barthes' work has been translated from French into an elegantly playful English by Richard Miller.<br />As a whole, the book has an informal, almost stream-of-consciousness feel to it. Barthes' text is richly studded with numerous cultural references--Bataille, the Kama Sutra, Sade, Severo Sarduy, Marx, the Buddhist sangha, Poe, Chomsky, and much more. Barthes often uses sexual imagery as a vehicle by which to construct a philosophy of reading. The result of all these elements is a dizzying, yet oddly delightful reading experience.<br />One of the key themes of &quot;The Pleasure of the Text&quot; is Barthes' attempt to define &quot;pleasure&quot; and &quot;bliss,&quot; and to delineate the differences between the text of pleasure and the text of bliss. From Barthes' project the close reader can thus derive a new way of looking at all texts.<br />Among other topics Barthes considers the hierarchical nature and pleasure factor of the sentence, as well as the erotic potential of the word. And throughout, his writing is marked by passages of wit and insight. A typical observation: &quot;The bastard form of mass culture is humiliated repetition [...].&quot;<br />&quot;The Pleasure of the Text&quot; often takes on a metaphysical, almost prophetic flavor. For those who are willing to dig into this dense text with gusto, it may prove to be an intellectual treasure heap.	2001-02-07

Arenas notes that he dictated part of the book into a tape recorder, and it was later transcribed by a friend. This format probably accounts for the book's intimate tone; I could imagine Arenas sitting in front of me and telling the whole story over coffee. The book has been translated into a forthright English by Dolores M. Koch.<br />&quot;Before Night Falls&quot; begins with Arenas' childhood in rural Cuba. It details his life as a writer, his many sexual exploits as a gay man, and his sufferings under the regime of Fidel Castro. It is amazing to read how Arenas had to struggle to exist as a writer in a police state; he tells how he was forced to hide manuscripts and how friends smuggled his writings out of Cuba for publication in foreign countries.<br />The book contains many shocking and painful episodes, such as his accounts of his own imprisonment and exile. But his life story also contains moments of humor and hope. Particularly interesting are Arenas' accounts of his friendships with other gay Cuban writers, such as Virgilio Pinera and Jose Lezama Lima. Overall, the tone of the book reflects Arenas' many moods: sensuous, angry, joyful, outraged, wry, melancholy, and--above all--defiant. His writing is rich in colorful personalities and fascinating anecdotes.<br />An interesting companion volume to Arenas' autobiography would be the book &quot;Eminent Maricones: Arenas, Lorca, Puig, and Me,&quot; by gay Colombian-born writer Jaime Manrique. Manrique knew Arenas personally, and &quot;Eminent Maricones&quot; contains an account of Arenas' last days as he worked to complete &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; while dying of AIDS-related complications. Having read that book made me appreciate Arenas' achievement even more.<br />At one point Arenas recalls advice given to him by Jose Lezama Lima: &quot;Remember that our only salvation lies in words: write!&quot; Reading this book, I get the sense that Arenas achieved his own personal &quot;salvation&quot; through his literature, and in particular, through this autobiography. &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; is an amazing human testament that moved me deeply. If you are interested in Latin American literature, gay studies, the art of autobiography, or human rights issues, I strongly recommend this book to you.Reading this book, I get the sense that Arenas achieved his own personal &quot;salvation&quot; through his literature, and in particular, through this autobiography. &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; is an amazing human testament that moved me deeply.

While it is an entertaining book with humorous illustrations, on the whole I find &quot;Mulberry Street&quot; to be oddly unsatisfying.<br />The story concerns young Marco, who has been asked by his father to tell him what he sees on the walk home from school. Seeing nothing but a horse and wagon, Marco lets his imagination run wild, until the horse and wagon are transformed into an elephant and brass band, accompanied by numerous other people and animals.<br />Without giving away the ending, I will say that the book seems to deliver a curiously conflicted message regarding storytelling and imagination. Although &quot;Mulberry Street&quot; is not at the level of Seuss' greatest classics, it is still an important landmark in children's literature, and would make a good addition to any family or school library.	2001-02-04

The author, David Walker, was a free black man who used this tract to expose and denounce racism. Walker published 3 editions of the pamphlet from 1829 to 1830, the year he was found dead--possibly the victim of a political assassination. The Black Classics Press edition contains an informative introduction by James Turner.<br />The &quot;Appeal&quot; contains a preamble and four &quot;Articles.&quot; Each of the Articles targets a phenomenon that contributes to the oppression of African Americans: slavery, ignorance, the &quot;Preachers of the Religion of Jesus Christ,&quot; and the &quot;Colonizing Plan.&quot;<br />Walker's tone is bold, but at times he sounds frenzied, even maniacal. In his more outraged moments, he sounds like a 19th century religious fanatic. Consider this statement from Article III: &quot;O Americans! Americans!! I call God--I call angels--I call men, to witness, that your DESTRUCTION is at hand, and will be speedily consummated unless you REPENT.&quot; But if you can read such outbursts in context, you will find the book as a whole to be an incisive, intelligent analysis of a racist societal superstructure.<br />Particularly important is Walker's harsh condemnation of white Christian preachers and institutions who promoted the oppression of black people. Walker reminds us that the &quot;status quo&quot; forces in American Christianity were key pillars of white supremacy. Overall, &quot;David Walker's Appeal&quot; is a crucial document which deserves a wide contemporary audience.	2001-02-03

The book introduces the reader to 14 different animals that you would see at a zoo: crocodile, hippopotamus, toucan, gorilla, and more. Each page combines a one-word caption with a colorful illustration.<br />The pictures are particularly appealing. Bright and colorful, these illustrations combine an iconic quality with realistic touches. From the grandeur of the peacock's tail to the charm of a koala mother and her baby, each picture is delightful. This is a fun book for both child and caregiver.	2001-02-03

Both the title play and &quot;Mystery of the Rose Bouquet&quot; have been translated into English by Allan Baker; &quot;Under a Mantle of Stars&quot; has been rendered into English by Ronald Christ. Together, these three plays demonstrate the imaginative power, psychological insight, and compassion of a major artist.<br />&quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; is probably the best known of the three plays; it has been adapted into both a major motion picture and an award winning musical play. Telling the story of imprisoned cellmates--one a flamboyant gay man, the other a passionate political revolutionary--&quot;Kiss&quot; explores such themes as sexual identity, suffering, and self respect. &quot;Under a Mantle of Stars&quot; is a surreal piece that examines crime, violence, lust, and twisted family ties. The final play in the collection, &quot;Mystery of the Rose Bouquet,&quot; is a moving drama about a hospitalized elderly woman and her nurse. &quot;Mystery&quot; deals with such issues as loss, duplicity, memory, and, ultimately, hope.<br />In &quot;Under a Mantle of Stars,&quot; one character remarks that another character &quot;dares to say whatever comes into her mind.&quot; To which a third character replies, &quot;Which is one form of madness.&quot; Perhaps, like all great writers, Puig shared this special, naked &quot;madness.&quot; But whether madness or genius, his works are memorable and powerful. This is an essential volume for those interested in Latin American literature, gay studies, or 20th century drama.	2001-02-03

In addition to the title rhyme, the book includes &quot;Old King Cole,&quot; &quot;Simple Simon,&quot; &quot;Hey Diddle Diddle,&quot; and other favorites.<br />Cousins' brightly colored artwork is a marvelous complement to the rhymes. She gives her pictures a deliberately child-like quality: rough outlines, curiously distorted human and animal figures. Her pictures thus have a wacky, almost innocent charm and energy to them.<br />I realize that the appropriateness of some traditional nursery rhymes may be debated by some--&quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; is, after all, a somewhat scary and tragic story if one dwells on it too long. But Cousins wisely avoids depicting the gorier elements of some of these rhymes. Overall, I give the book an enthusiastic recommendation.	2001-02-02

Margaret Sayers Peden has translated the Spanish original into a very readable English. Although the book was slow to grasp my close attention in the opening episodes, I ultimately found it to be a powerful and moving story of love in the midst of violence and fear.<br />Allende, who is Chilean, mixes a naturalistic style with several surreal touches in this novel. As the story progresses, her main characters investigate a disturbing mystery, and their ultimate discovery has a profound impact on several interconnected families. Allende uses this narrative framework to explore such issues as gender identity, philosophical conflict, religious difference, censorship, and the role of both the journalist and the soldier in the modern state. &quot;Of Love and Shadows&quot; is an important book for those interested in contemporary Latin American literature.	2001-02-02

Books	4	20	20	N	N	A fascinating view of &quot;Trek&quot; fandom	Originally published in 1975, &quot;Star Trek Lives!&quot; is a significant historical document of the world of &quot;Star Trek&quot; fandom. Co-authors Jacqueline Lichtenberg, Sondra Marshak, and Joan Winston all demonstrate a palpable affection for &quot;Star Trek,&quot; the classic science fiction television series of the late 1960s. This book is both an analysis and account of some of the currents in &quot;Trek&quot; fandom up to the mid-70s.<br />Although some of the pop psychoanalysis strikes me as a little overdone, the book is, in general, a serious and intelligent account of &quot;Star Trek&quot; and its fans. The authors analyze various elements of the show, and discuss such fan activities as the legendary &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions. Interspersed throughout the book are fascinating snippets of interviews with some of the creative people behind the series itself: producer Gene Roddenberry (who also contributes a foreword to the book), writer Dorothy Fontana, actor Leonard Nimoy, and others.<br />I found the most fascinating part of the book to be the overview of the fiction written and distributed by the fans themselves. Long before Captain Janeway took command of the Federation starship &quot;Voyager,&quot; &quot;Trek&quot; fans were writing tales about such female Starfleet captains as Morrow Akal Damion and T'Pelle of Vulcan. A number of writers explored the unknown pre-history of Spock's interspecies parents, Sarek and Amanda. And Jacqueline Lichtenberg's own &quot;Kraith&quot; series became its own sub-genre of &quot;Trek&quot; fan fiction, with more than 40 other writers contributing stories! The authors include short excerpts from many of the various fan creations.<br />It's amazing to read this 1975 book and think of how the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe has expanded since it was published: the feature films, &quot;The Next Generation,&quot; &quot;Deep Space Nine,&quot; &quot;Voyager,&quot; several comic book series, and the ever-expanding series of novels published by Pocket Books.

The book combines autobiographical material by the Colombian-born Manrique with chapters about three other gay male Hispanic writers: Cuba's Reinaldo Arenas, Spain's Federico Garcia Lorca, and Argentina's Manuel Puig. The book thus constitutes an exploration of a sort of pan-Hispanic gay male identity, as well as a moving meditation on the place of the literary artist in the modern world. Portions of the book have been previously published in both Spanish and English.<br />Manrique's autobiographical writing is fascinating. He describes his childhood in Colombia, his emigration to the United States, and his &quot;births&quot; as both a writer and a gay man. Particularly powerful is his memoir of learning how to read; for him, awakening to the power of literacy was a life-changing revelation: &quot;I felt as Balboa must have felt when he first glimpsed the Pacific.&quot;<br />Manrique knew both Arenas and Puig personally, and he writes with tenderness and insight of the last days of these two great writers. In his chapter on Lorca, he &quot;reconstructs&quot; a portrait of the man and the artist through second-hand accounts and through readings of Lorca's own fascinating writings.<br />Manrique describes Arenas, Lorca, and Puig as &quot;the great triumvirate of openly homosexual writers who have written in Spanish.&quot; Reading his reclamation of these three writers as his literary forbears, I was reminded of the work done by African-American writer Alice Walker to recover Zora Neale Hurston as a black literary foremother. Like Walker, Manrique honors those whose revolutionary literature continues to inspire new generations of writers.<br />Ultimately, Manrique expresses solidarity with and compassion for all who have suffered dispossession or persecution due to the prejudice of an entrenched status quo. I recommend &quot;Eminent Maricones&quot; to those interested in Latin American and pan-Hispanic studies, gay literature, and contemporary autobiography.ose interested in Latin American and pan-Hispanic studies, gay literature, and contemporary autobiography.	2001-02-01

Re-reading the book was a wonderful experience that reminded me how important Walker has been to so many people. The book opens with Walker's definition of the term &quot;womanist&quot;: &quot;a black feminist or feminist of color.&quot; The essays in this book, which span the late 1960s, the 1970s, and the early 1980s, thus represent the development of Walker's &quot;womanist&quot; vision.<br />The pieces include book reviews, letters to various publications, autobiographical pieces, and other prose selections. Many of her essays and reviews represent Walker's views on a range of literary figures: Jean Toomer, Langston Hughes, Flannery O'Connor, Phillis Wheatley, Buchi Emecheta, and many more. Particularly interesting is her essay about Rebecca Jackson, a 19th century African-American woman who joined a Shaker community. Especially important are Walker's writings about Zora Neale Hurston, whom she reclaims as a black literary foremother.<br />Other highlights include articles about Martin Luther King and his widow Coretta Scott King, and an account of a trip to Castro's Cuba. She also includes an article about &quot;Conditions: Five,&quot; the important collection of writings by black lesbian and straight women.<br />Alice Walker may be best known to general audiences for her novel &quot;The Color Purple,&quot; but &quot;In Search...&quot; reminds me of her skill and passion as an essayist. This is a collection which is, I believe, historically important for the academic field of women's studies. But it is not just a scholarly artifact; it is also a book that holds power and relevance that go beyond its historical moment.	2001-01-31

Most of the mini-essays in this book are only 2 or 3 pages long, making this a good selection for those whose hectic schedules force them to do their reading in &quot;found moments&quot; during the day. In the book Maya reflects on various topics: spirituality, style, travel, sensuality, and being a woman. Many of the selections contain autobiographical reminiscences.<br />As someone who has read Angelou's book-length autobiographical narratives and poetry collections, I was fascinated to see her writing in a different mode. In &quot;Wouldn't Take Nothing&quot; she reflects on some of the people of her life: her son, her grandmother, her voice teacher, and others. Her musings on spirituality have an inclusive, multi-faith flavor.<br />Some of Angelou's observations may seem a bit obvious. For example, in the opening mini-essay she declares, &quot;Being a woman is hard work.&quot; But what may obvious to some may be a revelation to others, and Angelou doesn't shy away from reaching out to that second group. And throughout the book her writing is graced with moments of wit and passion.<br />In the essay entitled &quot;Power of the Word,&quot; Angelou writes, &quot;I'm a spring leaf trembling in anticipation.&quot; I have no doubt that this appealing collection will leave readers trembling with anticipation for Maya Angelou's next book.	2001-01-31

Each page of the book contains one or two pairs of words that function as opposites: &quot;big&quot; and &quot;small&quot;; &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;light&quot;; &quot;day&quot; and &quot;night&quot;; etc. The illustrations are delightful. Boynton uses a variety of cartoon animals (pig, snail, elephant, turtle, etc.) to demonstrate the meaning of each pair of words.<br />My only reservation about the book is that it seems to reinforce dualistic thinking into children. I know that &quot;opposites&quot; is an important concept for children to learn, but I also believe that children need to develop a more flexible way to perceive and describe the world. Boynton's &quot;Opposites&quot; gives no indication, for example, that there is a &quot;room temperature&quot; in between &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold.&quot;<br />While I recommend this book for both its humorous artwork and educational value, I also recommend that parents take time to teach their kids that there are many variations between the seemingly irreconcilable opposites presented herein.	2001-01-30

And, as in the best of Seuss' books, all these elements come together to celebrate the power of the imagination. The entire book takes place in the mind of young Morris McGurk, who imagines creating an extravagant circus in the vacant lot behind Sneelock's Store.<br />And what a circus he imagines! As the scenario unfolds, we are treated to many marvelous sights: a 500-gallon lemonade dispenser, a Drum-Tummied Snumm, a fluff-muffled Truffle, a Spotted Atrocious, a trapeze troupe, and much, much more. Dr. Seuss' distinctive rhyming style is on full display throughout. Typical lines: &quot;Then my Tournament Knights! Noble apes without fears! / Sir Hector! Sir Vector! Sir Bopps! and Sir Beers!&quot;<br />Throughout the book, young McGurk imagines store owner Sneelock performing in the imaginary circus. This gives the book a subtle touch of gentle subversiveness, since Sneelock is an adult, and thus an authority figure. But the humor is never mean, and in fact Sneelock appears both courageous and talented in the many wild scenarios spun in the boy's head. All things considered, &quot;If I Ran the Circus&quot; is a delight, and another triumph for Dr. Seuss.	2001-01-30

The Essential Guide	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A visual feast for dinosaur lovers	&quot;Dinosaur: The Essential Guide&quot; is an oversized companion book to the animated film &quot;Dinosaur,&quot; which was a big 2000 hit for Walt Disney. This book, lavishly illustrated with scenes from the film, describes the characters, locales, and species that appear in the film.<br />The book is a visual treat. Disney used cutting-edge techniques to bring the creatures of &quot;Dinosaur&quot; to life, and the book captures each animal splendidly. The soft fur of the lemurs, the bony neck frill of the styracosaur, the fierce teeth of the carnotaur--all the details are vivid and memorable.<br />The book's effectiveness is, however, compromised by the fact that the authors seem unsure of their purpose. Is this book supposed to be a guide to the fictional world of the movie, or to the real world of dinosaurs as science understands them? For example, the book is filled with scientific-sounding observations like &quot;Herd dinosaurs are highly social animals, and during the nesting season the lake is the center of their bustling community.&quot; Sidebars with titles like &quot;Cretaceous Life&quot; add to this pseudoscientific flavor. But as far as I know, there is no evidence that dinosaurs spoke English or formed multispecies families with lemurs, as depicted in this film! This flaw aside, this book is a treat for kids who loved the movie, or who love dinosaurs in general.	2001-01-29

And many of the stories have twist endings. This collection has been translated into English by Edith Grossman.<br />These stories deal with Latin Americans on voyages, for various reasons, to Europe. The book thus has a trans-Atlantic, international feel. Highlights of the collection include &quot;Bon Voyage, Mr. President,&quot; about a deposed head of state seeking medical attention in Switzerland; &quot;The Saint,&quot; a supernatural tale of a father seeking canonization of his daughter from the Pope; the creepy &quot;The Ghosts of August&quot;; and the grotesque &quot;Seventeen Poisoned Englishmen.&quot;<br />Throughout the book Garcia Marquez presents many images that are beautiful or disturbing, but often memorable: a drowned man floating with &quot;a fresh gardenia in his lapel,&quot; a moray eel nailed to a door, a bedspread stiff with the dried blood from a murder. An added bonus is the appearance of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda as a fictional character in one of the tales. &quot;Strange Pilgrims&quot; is a varied collection of weird treats from a master storyteller.	2001-01-29

Craft, is an outstanding version of a classic tale. Although you may have read or seen versions of this story before, this book is truly special.<br />The story of King Midas, who gains the power to turn anything he touches to gold, is a tale with an important lesson. The story teaches us to not be greedy, and to treasure the people and things that we take for granted. These are important ideas for both children and adults. Charlotte Craft presents this story in straightforward, yet elegant language. A typical line: &quot;The roses glistened with the morning dew, and their scent gently perfumed the air.&quot;<br />But it is Kinuko Y. Craft's breathtaking artwork that really brings magic to this collaboration. Each illustration looks like a classic painting by an old master--lovingly detailed and alive with rich colors. K.Y. Craft's realistic portrayals of people, animals, and plants are an effective complement to the fantasy elements of the story. This book is both a timeless tale and a stunning work of art.	2001-01-28

This edition contains Alegria's Spanish originals, with English translations by her late husband Darwin Flakoll on facing pages.<br />&quot;Thresholds&quot; (&quot;Umbrales&quot; in Spanish) is a sort of mini-epic in poetic format. Its nine poem/chapters tell the story of a poet's embrace of her vocation. Themes in the book include transformation, initiation, family ties, and the encounter with nature.<br />What really makes the book interesting is its structure. Each of the nine poem/chapters is given a title that has a mythic, or iconic, feel to it: &quot;The River,&quot; &quot;Merlin,&quot; &quot;Chalice and Fount,&quot; etc. Throughout the poems are many multicultural references: Rilke, Merlin, the mandala, Kukulkan, Auschwitz, Fafnir, Deirdre of the Sorrows, John Lennon, and more.<br />As I read each chapter, I was reminded of the Tarot, the system of illustrated cards used by many to attain occult wisdom. Each of Alegria's poem/chapters is like one of the Major Arcana (or key iconic cards) of her own personal Tarot. The book thus takes on a haunting metaphysical quality.<br />And &quot;Thresholds&quot; is, like Alegria's other work, marked by passion, political commitment, and startling poetic imagery. I especially love when she writes &quot;I am the crow's eye / the persistent eye / scanning / fugitive instants of my time.&quot; I feel that our world is enriched by the presence of both Alegria's &quot;persistent eye&quot; and distinctive voice. This is an essential volume for those interested in Latin American literature, poetry, women's studies, and postmodern spirituality.	2001-01-28

As a critic, essayist, editor, and publisher, she has made available some incisive analyses and explorations of the paradoxes of American culture. And she has always written boldly and confidently from her own perspective as an African-American lesbian and feminist.<br />&quot;The Truth That Never Hurts: Writings on Race, Gender, and Freedom&quot; brings together Smith's own non-fiction prose writings from the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. In this collection we can see her development as a thinker. The pieces include her groundbreaking 1977 essay &quot;Toward a Black Feminist Criticism,&quot; her tribute to James Baldwin, and much, much more.<br />Smith discusses the work of such Black women writers as Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker and Toni Morrison. Particularly interesting is her exploration of the work of other Black lesbian writers like Pat Parker and Audre Lorde. She also writes about such volatile political issues as Black-Jewish relations, the Rodney King verdict, and the police brutality case involving Haitian immigrant Abner Louima. And she doesn't shy away from taking on other critics and public intellectuals. Smith doesn't discriminate on the basis of race, gender, or sexual orientation in her feisty quarrels with such figures as Darwin Turner, Elaine Showalter, and Andrew Sullivan.<br />As I write this review, I can hear the cynics and scoffers sneering, &quot;Hey, if she wasn't Black, gay, and female, she wouldn't have anything to write about.&quot; To such a statement I would reply: Read Smith's writings with an open yet critical mind, and with an appreciation for the historical context of each piece. I believe that she has important insights for all people, regardless of our own ethnic or sexual self-identification.<br />In her tribute to James Baldwin, Barbara Smith writes that she loved him &quot;because he made me want to shape prose with a clarity and fire that gave it the power to make people change.&quot; I believe that, in the course of her remarkable career, Smith has indeed changed our world for the better with her passionate writings. Read &quot;The Truth That Never Hurts&quot; and experience her own &quot;clarity and fire.&quot;e with a clarity and fire that gave it the power to make people change.&quot; I believe that, in the course of her remarkable career, Smith has indeed changed our world for the better with her passionate writings.

This book teaches about shapes, and the illustrations consist entirely of silhouettes of various items: people, elephants, boats, keys, etc.<br />The shadow-like illustrations are accompanied by rhymes in the familiar Seussian style: &quot;Peanuts and pineapples / noses and grapes. / Everything comes in different shapes.&quot; While the book is educational and entertaining, I felt that the silhouettes-only art lacked some of the wacky charm of the full Seussian illustration technique. Nevertheless, I recommend &quot;The Shape of Me and Other Stuff&quot; as a fun addition to the family or classroom library.	2001-01-27

This novel by Carlos Fuentes has been translated into English by Alfred Mac Adam. Taking place primarily in 1970, the book tells the story of a tempestuous love affair between the narrator, who is a Mexican novelist, and American actress Diana Soren.<br />The novel captures the turbulence of the era being portrayed. Such phenomena as the Black Power movement and FBI surveillance of suspected &quot;radicals&quot; are woven into the narrative. Particularly interesting is the way that real people appear as characters in the book; the other characters have encounters, and sometimes conversations, with such figures as William Styron, James Baldwin, and Tina Turner. The novel is superbly written, and deals with such fascinating topics as national identity, racial identity, obsession, paranoia, creativity, political radicalism, fidelity, and Hollywood mythmaking.<br />One interesting note: The character of Diana Soren appears to be based on a real-life person, actress Jean Seberg. I recommend that those who are fascinated by Fuentes' novel do a little research on Seberg's life. Finally, I give &quot;Diana&quot; high praise as an outstanding example of the art of the novel.	2001-01-27

Each entry is illustrated by a noun that begins with that letter. To reinforce the alphabet, each letter is actually incorporated into the illustration. For example, the alligator's mouth opens in an angle that physically encloses the letter &quot;A&quot;.<br />Curious George, the loveable monkey of the title, shows up as an observer or participant in most of the entries. As illustrated by H.A. Rey, George is as appealing as ever. I especially liked the illustration of George, bundled up in a snowsuit, looking at an &quot;icy icicle.&quot; This is a good book for children learning the alphabet.	2001-01-26

Cousins retells the story in straightforward, simple language.<br />What really makes this book stand out is the superb artwork. Cousins' pictures have a charmingly crude feel to them; they crackle with energy and color. The story of Noah, who takes two of every species of animal onto an oceangoing vessel in order to survive a flood, has always been an illustrator's dream, and Cousins revels in the scenario. We see alligators, ladybugs, penguins, mice, elephants, puffins, snakes, ostriches, and many, many more species.<br />Some may argue that the story itself is not necessarily fit for the youngest children; the notion of a divine being wiping out nearly all of humanity in an intentional global holocaust is, when you think about it, pretty terrifying! But with some guidance from a caring parent or guardian, this version of &quot;Noah's Ark&quot; could be fun for small children. Thanks to Lucy Cousins for a great job.	2001-01-26

This crisp reproduction is thus an accurate window into this era in United States home architecture. The wealth of detailed artistic renderings also make this a book of great charm and beauty.<br />Based in Davenport, Iowa, Gordon-Van Tine was a trailblazer in the field of prefabricated houses. This catalogue covers the company's products in amazing detail. We see cutaway views of homes that reveal the construction technique. We also see plumbing fixtures, lights, and cutaway views of furnaces.<br />But the heart of this catalogue lies in the detailed floor plans, as well as in the detailed artists' renditions of both exteriors and interiors. This catalogue contains structures ranging in size from a humble one-room vacation cottage to roomy nine-room farmhouses. Both one- and two-story houses appear. The main styles represented are bungalow and colonial revival (the latter including &quot;Dutch colonial&quot; designs), in many different configurations.<br />The exterior drawings capture many features: columned porches, sun porches, various roof types (gabled, hipped, gambrel), dormers, exposed rafter tails, and more. Equally detailed and charming are the depictions of furnished interiors. This is truly a marvelous book.	2001-01-26

The short novel has been translated into a crisp English by Lysander Kemp; it is available in an outstanding bilingual edition in which each two-page spread contains a page of Fuentes' Spanish original and a page of Kemp's translation.<br />As the novel begins, scholar Felipe Montero accepts an assignment to edit the memoirs of the late General Llorente, a contemporary of Mexican Emperor Maximilian. In the creepy, rat-infested home of the general's eccentric widow, Felipe develops a strange relationship with the widow's niece, Aura.<br />This dreamlike tale contains elements of mystery, horror, fantasy, romance, and academic satire. The book also offers tantalizing glimpses into Mexican and European history. This is the first book by Fuentes which I have read, but it has whetted my appetite for more.	2001-01-24

It is also one of the most thoroughly documented systems of human rights abuse in history. &quot;The Classic Slave Narratives&quot; brings together four powerful testaments of individuals who survived enslavement in the Americas. The book also contains an insightful introduction by scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr.<br />As Gates notes in the introduction, it has been estimated that more than 6,000 ex-slaves left some form of written testament between 1703 and 1944--an amazing body of literature. &quot;The Classic Slave Narratives&quot; is thus just a tiny part of a vast genre. Specifically, this anthology contains &quot;the Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano,&quot; &quot;The History of Mary Prince,&quot; &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,&quot; and Harriet Jacobs' &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.&quot;<br />Each of the four powerful texts offers an effective complement to the others in the collection. In other words, each narrative illuminates at least one unique and important aspect of the American slave experience. Olaudah Equiano, for example, tells what it was like for a native African to be enslaved and transported across the Atlantic in a slave ship. Prince illuminates the life of a slave woman on the Caribbean islands. Douglass, born to a slave mother and a white father, describes in detail his quest for literacy. And Jacobs offers an incisive window into the sexual pathology of the slaveowning society.<br />These four texts are both valuable historical documents and fascinating works of literature. Much American literature--autobiography, poetry, novels, essays, and other genres--demonstrates the influence of, or parallels to, these pivotal texts. &quot;The Classic Slave Narratives&quot; is a necessary text for those interested in United States and Caribbean history, in American literature, in literacy, or in human rights.	2001-01-23

Directed towards beginning readers, this book combines an easy-to-read text with full color nature photography on every page.<br />As do the other volumes in this series, this book contains a &quot;Picture Word List&quot; at the end. This feature is basically a visual glossary that illustrates each vocabulary word (&quot;pincer,&quot; &quot;seaweed,&quot; &quot;waves,&quot; etc.) with a photograph. This is a good feature that adds to the book's educational value.<br />We see the seagulls tending their nest and their eggs. Much of the book follows the male gull as he searches for food; we see him encounter a crab, a starfish, and other marine life. Overall, the combination of good photography and literacy aids make &quot;A Day at Seagull Beach&quot; a good choice for children.	2001-01-23

The book has been translated into an elegantly readable English by Edith Grossman. This short, but dense, novel takes place in Latin America during the colonial era. The plot revolves around Sierva Maria, the daughter of a colonial nobleman, who is suspected of either having rabies or being demon-possessed. The drama of Sierva Maria and her dysfunctional, slaveowning family is complicated by the entry of Cayetano Delaura, a priest assigned to examine her case.<br />Garcia Marquez' insightful deconstruction of the sexual and racial anxieties of a slaveowning society is reminiscent of some of the best work of United States author William Faulkner. The use of rabies as a plot device is also fascinating, and tempts me to read this novel, in part, as an ironic commentary on our own era's reaction to the AIDS epidemic. And the novel's satirical view of religious bureaucracy adds a further layer of complexity.<br />Especially noteworthy is Garcia Marquez' depiction of interracial relations in colonial Latin America, and of the cultural and religious hybridization that was an important part of that world. And of course, as in all of Garcia Marquez' great works of fiction, we meet a colorful cast of almost Dickensian characters as the story unfolds. If you are interested in Latin American literature or historical fiction, you won't want to miss &quot;Of Love and Other Demons.&quot;	2001-01-23

Auld's easy-to-read text is complemented by the excellent full-color illustrations of Diana Mayo.<br />Overall, Auld and Mayo are faithful to the original text, with one curious exception. In the biblical Book of Jonah, not only does the king of Nineveh order all his people to put on sackcloth and fast (chapter 3), but he also orders the animals of the city to do so! This bizarre detail is left out of the Auld/Mayo version. And that's a shame; the illustrator missed a wonderful opportunity to depict some marvelous images.<br />A useful map is included at the end of the book. Other study aids at the end of the book are clearly directed towards a believing Jewish or Christian audience; thus, parents who belong to a different faith tradition, or who are interested in the story of Jonah purely as literature, may want to skip this material.  Overall, this version of Jonah is well-done. I give especially high praise to Diana Mayo's fine artwork, which captures many iconic images with both delicacy and energy. This book is a good choice for the family library.	2001-01-23

This book has been edited and translated by Claribel Alegria and Darwin J. Flakoll. Alegria is a distinguished poet who grew up on El Salvador, and Flakoll (who has since died) was her husband and longtime literary collaborator. Those who are moved or intrigued by this book should seek out some of their other work.<br />As the editors explain in the brief introduction, this volume brings together poetry written by Salvadoran revolutionaries who took part in the civil war against the government of that troubled nation. Many of the contributors are identified only by their first name and job within the revolutionary movement. The contributors include literacy teachers, political educators, and members of the guerrilla forces.<br />The poets in &quot;On the Front Line&quot; write about violence, literacy, economic struggle, love, and poetry itself. The tones of the pieces range widely: angry, ironic, determined, affectionate, hopeful. Some of the poems employ a Marxist rhetoric which some readers may find distracting, but that others may appreciate.<br />There are many standouts in this remarkable gathering. In &quot;Pregnancy,&quot; by Lety, an expectant mother speaks with great tenderness about the child in her womb: &quot;Mute astronaut / I sense your small life / sending me cyphered messages from your warm space.&quot; And &quot;What Is Poetry?&quot;, by Eduardo Sancho Castaneda, is a brilliant and biting meditation on the art of poetry itself: &quot;Poetry is subversion, it's a tree whose roots gnaw away at the rock.&quot;<br />Do the editors and poets in this volume have a political agenda? Yes, but this agenda does not take away from the power and value of the poems in this collection. And for that matter, don't most poets (and critics!) have &quot;agendas&quot; of one sort or another? &quot;On the Front Line&quot; is a fascinating and worthwhile anthology. If you are interested in poetry, politics, or Latin American studies, I believe you will find yourself enriched by this book.ting and worthwhile anthology.

In this installment, Brother and Sister Bear, accompanied by their excitable pet dog, take a rocket trip to the moon and back.<br />Although the book's primary purpose is entertainment and literacy education, the Berenstains do get some of the science right. The portray the gravity-free environment of the space ship's interior during the voyage, and they also show that the gravity on the lunar surface is much less than that on Earth.<br />The book is illustrated in the typically appealing Berenstain Bears style. Particularly fun is the orange, green, and purple-colored rocket ship used by the intrepid space travelers. And the rhymes are equally fun. Example: &quot;Two little bears / and one little pup. / They are off to the moon, / going up, up, up!&quot; This irresistible adventure tale is definitely a high point in a beloved book series.	2001-01-22

And I fear that King the &quot;legend&quot; has become so big that people may be paying insufficient attention to King the writer. If you want to experience King's insight and power as a writer, read &quot;Strength to Love.&quot; This collection of sermons is an excellent summation of the philosophy he developed as a Christian clergyman, social critic, and advocate for the African-American community.<br />Most of the sermons in the book begin with a Bible verse which ties in to the theme of each sermon. One of the main themes of the collection as a whole is King's passionate denunciation of racial prejudice and of the tangible injustice that springs from that phenomenon.<br />King is also very critical of those sectors of the Christian world that have historically used the Bible and Christian theology as tools for promoting slavery, American racial segregation, and South African apartheid. Indeed, in the sermon entitled &quot;A knock at midnight&quot; he refers to the Christian churches' historic support of racism as one of &quot;the shameful tragedies of history.&quot; And he is also critical of those Black churches that have reduced Christianity to either a frenzied form of &quot;entertainment&quot; or a snobbish social club. These are hard words that contemporary Christians need to hear and heed.<br />King's own vision of Christianity is bold and revolutionary. And this vision is firmly grounded in the person of Jesus, whom he describes as &quot;the world's most dedicated nonconformist.&quot; While strongly Christian, King is nonetheless respectful of the truths found in other religious traditions.<br />One fascinating sermon includes King's balanced critique of Communism. In another sermon, he praises Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi, who greatly influenced King's philosophy of nonviolence. Ultimately, King's vision and compassion is vast: in &quot;The man who was a fool,&quot; he writes, &quot;All men are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality.&quot;<br />King's radicalism, his willingness to critique the failings of the Christian world, and his rejection of a rigidly fundamentalist style of Christianity have made him a target of ugly criticism from some more conservative Christians. (Consider, for example, author Paul McGlasson; in his 1994 book &quot;Another Gospel&quot; he condemns King as a &quot;false prophet.&quot;) And I fear that others have tried to &quot;sanitize&quot; King's strong message. And that is why &quot;Strength to Love&quot; is such an important book. It is an important historical document of a critical era.

In the book, a contemporary Black mother tells her son about Mansa Musa, the 14th century ruler of the African empire of Mali. Roundtree's simple rhyming text is accompanied by colorful, evocative artwork.<br />My problem with the book lies in the author's portrayal of Mansa Musa, and with the values the book seems to promote. Throughout the book she focuses on Mansa Musa's wealth, military power, and authoritarian control of his domain. Typical illustrations show a decadent cache of coins and golden artifacts, soldiers riding with swords drawn, and armed security guards marching in formation. The text thus seems to celebrate a militaristic, violent, wealth-obsessed police state.<br />Ironically, the text notes that Mansa Musa's empire stretched from &quot;the salt mines of Taghaza to the copper mines of Kakedda.&quot; Of course, Roundtree conveniently avoids mentioning that these sites were probably worked by slave labor. One encyclopedia article I consulted noted that Mansa Musa took a personal retinue of 12,000 slaves with him during a pilgrimage to Mecca. Thus there seems to be a bit of &quot;politically correct&quot; evasiveness to Roundtree's portrait.<br />Roundtree is clearly a talented writer/illustrator, but this book raises some troubling questions. I recommend that concerned parents preview this book before sharing it with their children.	2001-01-22

An ordained minister of the United Church of Christ and a university professor, Comstock brings both sensitivity and intelligence to his subject. Ultimately, his is a forward-thinking and inclusive Christian theology which affirms that gay love and sexuality are not only compatible with the Christian walk, but that the Christian community as a whole is impoverished by the exclusion of self-affirming lesbians and gay men.<br />Comstock incorporates both revealing autobiographical passages and incisive scholarly work into his explorations of several biblical texts. He also has an admirable sense of humility; in his introduction he notes that he does not claim to have constructed a definitive pro-gay Christian theology. Rather, he writes, &quot;My intention is not to speak for others, but to add my voice to others' and to encourage others to speak.&quot;<br />Comstock's readings of biblical passages are fascinating. I particularly liked his bold re-reading of the book of Leviticus; unlike some who selectively harp on a scattered handful of verses, Comstock looks at the entire book in larger political, historical, and cultural contexts. Also remarkable is his analysis of the book of Esther: he sees in the character of Queen Vashti a &quot;role model for lesbians and gay men.&quot;<br />In his explorations of the Bible, Comstock incorporates quotes and ideas from many sources: poet Gary Snyder, literary scholar Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, African-American writer Audre Lorde, and more. Although he is open to other voices, his own vision is strong and compelling. He is particularly adept at taking cliches and assumptions and turning them upside down.<br />Gary David Comstock is a gay Christian whose work is relevant to all moral people, regardless of their own sexual identity or religious orientation. Regarding the Bible, Comstock writes, &quot;I have begun to engage it as I would a friend&quot; (Chapter 1). Engage Comstock's own book as you would a friend, and you might come away with an experience that is both intellectually and spiritually rewarding.ng the Bible, Comstock writes, &quot;I have begun to engage it as I would a friend&quot; (Chapter 1).

It Bites: Real-Life Monsters, Up Close,&quot; the book written by Trevor Day in collaboration with Mike Jolley and Dugald Steer. Directed towards young readers, this educational book is an introduction to a wide assortment of potentially dangerous plants and animals. Species described include the rattlesnake, poison ivy, the piranha, the blue-ringed octopus, and many, many more. Day's text is accompanied on every page by detailed full-color photographs.<br />There is much to like about &quot;Youch! It Bites.&quot; The physical format of the book is interesting. Every two-page spread contains a fold-out page with a surprise underneath the fold. From an educational standpoint, the book is full of fascinating facts and images. The mating dance of scorpions, the bright colors of tropical frogs, and other discoveries add to the book's appeal.<br />The main problem lies in the book's sensationalistic, exploitative tone. I don't like the &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; approach to educational children's books, and &quot;Youch&quot; revels in this mentality. It starts with the book's subtitle. The species in this book are not, in my opinion, &quot;monsters,&quot; but rather animals simply trying to survive. The author constantly dwells on potential death and injury. I fear this book will, rather than get kids interested in nature, instead give them unhealthy phobias.<br />And some of the photos may simply be too graphic and frightening for more sensitive children. Particularly questionable is a huge close-up of a snake beginning to swallow a dead mouse. This is certainly a potentially nightmare-inducing image!<br />The collaborators on this book are to be commended for trying to make science fun. But the result is a very problematic book. I recommend that parents preview this text before sharing it with their children. But for bolder and more adventurous youngsters, this book may be a real treat.	2001-01-21
2133935:US	51987970	R1F64OKKKHL71D	0811209059	414314422	Seven Nights (English and Spanish Edition)	Books	5	21	21	N	N	A leisurely intellectual journey with Borges	&quot;Seven Nights&quot; brings together seven lectures delivered by Jorge Luis Borges in Buenos Aires in 1977. They have been translated into a straightforward English by Eliot Weinberger. Despite the wealth of literary and cultural references made in the lectures, they have an informal feel to them: you can imagine the Argentine master writer sitting across from you at a coffee shop and speaking these words.<br />In the lectures Borges discusses, in turn, Dante's &quot;Divine Comedy,&quot; nightmares, the &quot;Thousand and One Nights,&quot; Buddhism, poetry, the Kabbalah, and his own blindness. The book thus has a multicultural aspect that spans time and language. Along the way, Borges references many other writers: Homer, Shakespeare, Cervantes, Nietzsche, Poe, and others.<br />The book, although rambling at times, is full of characteristically &quot;Borgesian&quot; gems. Consider, for example, the passages where he reflects on the translations of the word &quot;nightmare&quot; (&quot;pesadilla&quot; in Spanish) in various languages. I was also intrigued by his attempt to define magic. Particularly moving and thought-provoking are his thoughts on blindness. Borges suggests that, for him, blindness is no mere handicap, but rather &quot;a way of life: one of the styles of living&quot; that has actually brought to him &quot;some gifts.&quot;<br />Borges is sometimes playful, often witty, and always learned. In the lecture on blindness, Borges notes, &quot;I had always imagined Paradise as a kind of library.&quot; I, too, imagine my personal Paradise to contain a library--and among that library's contents would be the complete works of Borges.	2001-01-19

Murawski, is a collection of extreme close-up photographs of the &quot;faces&quot; of insects and other arthropods. The photos are accompanied by interesting facts about each creature. Much of the educational data focuses on the facial features being pictured; for example, the author explains why different species use different kinds of mouths to eat particular types of food.<br />The photographs are stunning. These creatures are shown much larger than life size, and the photographs capture a wealth of details. These portraits capture a glorious diversity of colors and textures. Species pictured include the dragonfly, the daddy-longlegs, the bumblebee, the cicada, and the grasshopper. There is even a section on the &quot;false faces&quot; used by some creatures in order to fool would-be predators. This is an excellent educational book for children; it would also make a fun &quot;coffee table&quot; book for adults.	2001-01-19

The result is fine book for young readers who are interested in gorillas.<br />Simon describes the different subspecies of gorilla: the western lowland, eastern lowland, and mountain gorilla. He also discusses gorilla anatomy and social life. Particularly interesting is the material about gorilla babies and their development. Simon makes it clear that gorillas are, in general, peaceful beings who have sometimes been inaccurately portrayed by the entertainment industry. Towards the end of the book, Simon discusses some threats to wild gorillas and pays tribute to the work of pioneering gorilla researchers George Schaller and Dian Fossey.<br />Of course, very young readers will be happy to simply look at the stunning photographs in the book. The cameras capture the varied range of gorilla facial expression and body language. Especially moving are the pictures of young gorillas and gorilla family groups. Looking into the faces of these beings, you can really see the genetic kinship they share with humans (Simon notes that our two species share 98% of our DNA).&quot;Gorillas&quot; is another fine achievement for Seymour Simon.	2001-01-18

Subtitled &quot;Tales Based on Mayan Myths and Guatemalan Legends,&quot; this volume has been translated into English by Gilbert Alter-Gilbert.<br />In this book, Asturias draws upon Central American history and culture to create several fascinating short pieces. His style (as I read it through Alter-Gilbert's translation) is psychedelic and florid; Asturias mixes realistic and fantastic elements throughout the book. The result is comparable to a prose version of the paintings of Spanish artist Salvador Dali.<br />I don't find all of the stories in &quot;The Mirror of Lida Sal&quot; to be equally effective. At times, Asturias' indulgence in ornate wordplay seems to overwhelm plot and characterization. But this is still a richly rewarding volume for the attentive reader. Some of the major themes of the book include magic, transformation, and cultural hybridization.<br />The best pieces in the book include the title story, which tells of a working class mulatta's attempt to ensnare the man of her desire; &quot;Anteater Juan,&quot; a bizarre fantasy; and &quot;Legend of the Silent Bell,&quot; a story of religious fanaticism and trans-Atlantic intrigue in colonial Central America. Miguel Angel Asturias is one of the most important figures in Latin American literature, and &quot;The Mirror of Lida Sal&quot; is definitely worth gazing into.	2001-01-18

It has been translated from Spanish into English by Paul Blackburn. The book is a collection of interconnected short pieces that often blur the distinctions between the short story and the essay; some of the pieces further share aspects of poetry and drama. Cortazar also incorporates elements of fantasy, science fiction, horror, and comedy into this work. Call &quot;Cronopios and Famas&quot; a novel, if you prefer; or simply label it &quot;experimental literature.&quot; But whatever you call it, read it!<br />The book is divided into four main sections, each of which is further subdivided into several short pieces. The first section, &quot;The Instruction Manual,&quot; contains such pieces as &quot;Instructions on How to Cry&quot; and &quot;Instructions on How to Climb a Staircase.&quot; Cortazar invites us to look at everyday things and actions from a radically altered perspective; in the process, he seems to point towards an occult, or metaphysical, wisdom.<br />The second section, &quot;Unusual Occupations,&quot; details the antics of a bizarre family (think TV's &quot;Addams Family&quot; as drawn by Dr. Seuss, with input from Franz Kafka). The third section, &quot;Unstable Stuff,&quot; is the most varied and chaotic section of the book, and is rich in fantastic and absurd elements.<br />The final section of the book has the same title as the entire book: &quot;Cronopios and Famas.&quot; In several short vignettes Cortazar draws a portrait of an alternate society populated by three different types (races? castes? species?) of beings: Cronopios, Famas, and Esperanzas. Cortazar describes the individuals of each group, and details many instances of social interactions between the groups. This final section of the book is reminiscent of Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World,&quot; but more cryptic. Along the way we witness the invention of the &quot;wild-artichoke clock&quot; and get a glimpse of &quot;GENITAL, the Cigarette with Sex.&quot;<br />&quot;Cronopios and Famas&quot; is not for the lazy reader. I must admit that after my first reading of the book, I didn't really like it that much. But the second time I read it, I said to myself, &quot;This is brilliant! What was wrong with me the first time I read it?&quot; I wonder what my reactions will be on my third and fourth readings. This book, rich in irony and remarkable images, is truly a remarkable achievement by one of the most innovative masters of 20th century literature.ild-artichoke clock&quot; and get a glimpse of &quot;GENITAL, the Cigarette with Sex.&quot;<br />&quot;Cronopios and Famas&quot; is not for the lazy reader.

This volume uses a very simple text and colorful illustrations to introduce some basic prepositions and adverbs to beginning readers.<br />The simple plot follows the adventure of the Bear family's young boy cub, who &quot;stows away&quot; in a box and gets shipped to town. This is, however, one aspect of the book of which parents should be cautious. Enjoy the book with your children, but make sure they know not to climb into and hide in strange containers--such activity might be dangerous! The hero of our book, on the other hand, suffers no ill consequences from his actions.<br />Overall, &quot;Inside, Outside...&quot; is not the best in the &quot;Bears&quot; series, but it is still an entertaining book with educational value. And the characteristic Berenstain artwork is always charming.	2001-01-15

The result is a delightful book for beginning readers.<br />Like the other books in this series, &quot;Tale of a Tadpole&quot; includes a &quot;Picture Word List&quot; at the end. This is basically a summary of vocabulary words with a photograph to illustrate each word: &quot;gills,&quot; &quot;eye,&quot; etc. The main text of the book begins with the newly laid eggs, and depicts the tadpole (and sometimes his siblings) hatching, evading predators, and undergoing the marvelous metamorphosis into a full-grown frog.<br />The photography is superb. Both &quot;action shots&quot; and more relaxed scenes are skillfully captured. And our star tadpole/frog is a most appealing hero! Overall, I highly recommend this book both for its educational value and for its charm.	2001-01-14

As the title indicates, much of the book's content revolves around loving and surviving as a lesbian in the 20th century. Clarke also writes about racism and injustice, and reflects upon the people and events of her world. Much of the book has a gritty, urban flavor to it.<br />In the poem &quot;wearing my cap backwards,&quot; Clarke writes, &quot;poets are among the first witches / so suffer none to live.&quot; This sets the tone for her poetic style: edgy, dangerous, and allied with the most marginalized elements of society. As she explores her subjects--lesbian sex, racially biased courtrooms, recreational drug use, road kill, and more--Clarke uses language that is alternatingly lusty, playful, profane, enraged, and/or outraged.<br />Some of the most memorable selections from &quot;Living As a Lesbian&quot; include &quot;living as a lesbian on the make,&quot; which narrates the adventure of a lesbian in a &quot;straight&quot; bar; &quot;Indira,&quot; an irony-laden reflection on the life and public image of Indian leader Indira Gandhi; and &quot;sexual preference,&quot; a humorous meditation on lesbian sexual practices.<br />As Clarke spins her poetic webs, she ensnares many public figures: Jesse Jackson, Anita Bryant, Vanessa Williams, and more. Her vision is international, multi-cultural, and unbound by time: &quot;i hear a marimba player chanting / her slave song in portuguese&quot; (from &quot;marimba&quot;). As in her other books, Clarke finds a wealth of inspiration in African-American culture and history.<br />In the poem entitled &quot;living as a lesbian underground: a futuristic fantasy,&quot; Clarke writes, &quot;Leave signs of struggle. / Leave signs of triumph.&quot; This book, along with Clarke's other volumes of poetry, contains powerful signs of both struggle and triumph on the part of a remarkable poet.	2001-01-13

Dr. Seuss' best books tend to have a touch of fantasy (or light-hearted science fiction) to them, and &quot;There's a Wocket in My Pocket!&quot; falls into that category. In this book of simple rhymes, the narrator introduces the reader to the gallery of weird creatures that share his home. There's no plot, but there are Seussian creatures galore.<br />Beginning with the Wocket of the cover, each creature favors a habitat that conveniently rhymes with its name. Example: &quot;And that Zelf up on that shelf! / I have talked to him myself.&quot; The creatures include the pink-and-yellow striped Zlock, the cantankerous Yottle, the creepy Vug, the gravity-defying Geeling, and many others. As always, Seuss' colorful artwork is rich in whimsical details.<br />The narrator loves his home and its weird inhabitants. The book thus seems to have the message that it's OK to be different, or to come from a home that others might find odd. And that's a lesson I like! So enjoy the book, and don't be surprised if you find a &quot;Ghair&quot; under your chair.	2001-01-12

This new version of the collection replaces Sheldon's original comments with those of Arnold Lewis. But the real &quot;stars&quot; of the book are the 93 houses and four casinos portrayed in the excellent black-and white photos.<br />These houses represent some of the most stunning mansions of the late 19th century. Most of these buildings were built in the northeastern United States. Each plate is accompanied by both Lewis' comments and by a first floor plan.<br />The houses themselves represent many of the popular styles of the era: Tudor, &quot;Shingle,&quot; Queen Anne, Chateauesque, Richardsonian Romanesque, Colonial Revival, and Exotic Revival. The crisp photography captures a wealth of beautiful details: covered verandas, stone arches, classical pillars, towers, pinnacles, parapets, half-timbering, castellations, fanciful dormers, and intricate decorative flourishes.<br />The only disappointing aspect to the book is the fact that only the first floor plans are included. Plans for the other floors would have increased the book's value as a record of social history. Nevertheless, the detailed first floor plans do offer fascinating insights into the lives of the wealthy families of the &quot;Gilded Age.&quot; You can imagine yourself wandering through the billiard room or music room of your favorite mansion! If you are fascinated by American home architecture, or if you simply want a taste of this opulent era, you will love this book.	2001-01-12

This is a bilingual edition, with each of Alegria's Spanish poems accompanied by Carolyn Forche's English translations. Forche has also written an introduction in which she explains how much of this book reflects Alegria's emotions over the death of her husband, Bud Flakoll.<br />Alegria's poems are emotionally raw, and graced with lyrical beauty and stunning imagery. Many of the poems in this collection revisit figures from Greek mythology: Ariadne, Circe, Sisyphus, and more. Particularly powerful is &quot;The Reflections of Icarus,&quot; which re-imagines this character as a metaphor for poets. A number of other poems are short, haiku-like creations that examine both nature and the human world.<br />In the poem &quot;This Is a Night of Shadows,&quot; Alegria writes, &quot;My heart wishes / to burst with rage / but it sprouts wings.&quot; This memorable image is characteristic of her work. Alegria moves from tragedy to transcendence, and her work is rich in insight. This is an important volume by one of the great writers of Central America.	2001-01-11

A &quot;picture word list,&quot; consisting of vocabulary words accompanied by photographs that portray what the words stand for (&quot;nest,&quot; &quot;egg,&quot; etc.), is included at the end of the book.<br />The &quot;river&quot; in which the family lives looks artificial--like a zoo exhibit--but I doubt that this element will bother the young readers towards whom the book is directed. The photographs depict the ducklings hatching, taking their first steps, and swimming with their mother. And let's face it: ducklings, like most baby animals, have a built-in appeal!

Many of the poems incorporate Swahili words, and a useful Swahili-English vocabulary at the end of the book adds to its educational value. Also useful is a full-page map of Tanzania which shows the location of Zanzibar Island, Mount Meru, and other important landmarks.<br />The poems and illustrations introduce readers to the people, customs, food, animals, and geographic features of Tanzania. Grimes favors appealing, song-like rhymes in her poems. For example, &quot;A Taste of Zanzibar&quot; begins, &quot;Go to Zanzibar to see / a nutmeg bush, a cashew tree.&quot; Lewin's watercolor illustrations are colorful and have an energetic grace to them.<br />Both the poet and the illustrator seem to take great delight in their subjects. As the book progresses, we encounter a crowded bus ride, an elderly mango peddler's cheerful song, the majesty of Mount Meru, the hot peppers that spice Tanzanian food, and other African delights. This is a wonderful book for children who are interested in poetry, in the Swahili language (or foreign languages in general), or in African life and culture.	2001-01-11

But however you define the word, &quot;Zami&quot; is a powerful and beautiful text which illuminates the life of an African-American lesbian in the mid-20th century.<br />&quot;Zami&quot; begins with the young Audre and her parents, a Black immigrant couple who had settled in New York City. Lorde writes in detail of her cultural heritage from the Caribbean island of Grenada. From her childhood in Harlem to her young adulthood, the book is full of fascinating episodes and poetic language. Lorde's description of using her mother's traditional mortar and pestle to grind spices in the Caribbean style is a particular tour-de-force of sensuous language.<br />Lorde describes the roots of her life as a poet. She also vividly recalls what it was like to be a young Black lesbian in the 1950s. This particular aspect of &quot;Zami&quot; gives the book a special historical value. Lorde's narrative captures many of the cultural and political particulars of that era.<br />Audre Lorde attained a distinguished literary reputation as both a poet and essayist. But serious readers of Lorde must not miss her extraordinary &quot;biomythography.&quot; This is an essential American life story which ranks up there with those of Benjamin Franklin, Harriet Jacobs, Malcolm X, and other important figures. Whether you're interested in the Caribbean-American experience, African-American literature, lesbian studies, or mid-20th century United States history, you will want to explore &quot;Zami.&quot;<br />In this book Audre Lorde writes, &quot;Every woman I have ever loved has left her print upon me.&quot; If you read &quot;Zami,&quot; Lorde just might leave a lasting print upon you.	2001-01-10

Along the way, we learn how the girl born as &quot;Marguerite Johnson&quot; got the distinctive name by which she is known today. King also handles the subject of childhood sexual abuse, of which Angelou is a survivor, with honesty and sensitivity.<br />Angelou's is a fascinating life story. King documents her early family life, her own life as a mother, her career in the entertainment industry, her contributions to the civil rights movement, and her experiences in Africa. We also learn of her emergence as a well-known writer with &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,&quot; the first volume of Angelou's wonderful multi-part autobiography.<br />Hopefully, young readers who are fascinated by this biography will want to explore Angelou's own writings.

Dodd attempts to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; the image of Paul, the apostle who authored many of the letters of the New Testament. Dodd's book is an uneasy blend of &quot;politically correct&quot; posturing and neo-conservative rigidity. Ultimately, Dodd seems to defend an approach to biblical interpretation which allows the believer to continue to wallow in convenient prejudices.<br />Throughout history, the New Testament writings attributed to Paul have been abundant sources of &quot;proof-texts&quot;--that is, texts used to justify one's position--by racists, anti-Semites, sexists, anti-gay bigots, and other supporters of destructive ideologies. (Jim Hill and Rand Cheadle have documented some of the &quot;Pauline problem&quot; in their book &quot;The Bible Tells Me So: Uses and Abuses of Holy Scripture.&quot;) Dodd addresses some of these controversies and tries to re-paint Paul as a misunderstood guy with some genuinely forward-thinking ideas.<br />But I find Dodd's approach to be contradictory and unconvincing. He asserts, for example, that Christians need not follow Paul's restrictions regarding female headgear (1 Cor. 11:5-6) and female leadership in church (1 Tim. 2:11-15), and accuses Christians who take these verses literally of an &quot;interpretive naivete&quot; which Dodd deems &quot;unhelpful.&quot; But then he turns around and asserts that Christians must adhere to an anti-gay interpretation of other Pauline passages. Although he performs ample verbal gymnastics in order to justify his positions, it seems to me that Dodd is picking and choosing which verses he wants to read &quot;literally,&quot; and which he wants to write off as culturally bound. And woe to anyone who disagrees with Dodd's personal likes and dislikes; in his view, they are obviously wrong!<br />Particularly ridiculous is his chapter about Paul's comments on the institution of slavery. A large part of his argument seems to boil down to the equation that ancient Greco-Roman slavery was good, and American slavery was bad. Does it follow that, as long as Christians follow the allegedly benevolent ancient model, it is perfectly all right for them to hold their fellow humans as slaves?<br />Some of the ground covered by Dodd is dealt with in a much more thoughtful and morally consistent manner by Peter J. Gomes in &quot;The Good Book: Reading the Bible with Mind and Heart.&quot; While Dodd has some interesting ideas, and is clearly a skilled writer, &quot;The Problem with Paul&quot; as a whole is riddled with problems.boil down to the equation that ancient Greco-Roman slavery was good, and American slavery was bad.

Alarcon and illustrator Maya Christina Gonzalez. Although marketed as a children's book, this bilingual collection should appeal to readers of all ages.<br />Each of Alarcon's poems is presented both in English and Spanish versions, making this book an added bonus for English speakers who are learning Spanish (or the other way around). The poetry in this book is a populist literature in the tradition of Walt Whitman and Pablo Neruda, and some of Alarcon's whimsical reflections on the natural world also reminded me of Emily Dickinson. And while being part of a great tradition, Alarcon has his own strong poetic voice which stands apart.<br />Alarcon is a United States poet, and, as he explains in the afterword (which also appears in both English and Spanish), these poems were inspired by childhood trips to visit his rural relatives in Mexico. This book is thus a multicultural celebration of family, of ethnic roots, of childhood memories, and of the beauty of nature. Alarcon writes of being taught the alphabet by his grandfather, of walking barefoot on the grass, of befriending a cow name Mariposa (&quot;butterfly&quot; in Spanish), and of other delightful things.<br />Gonzalez' illustrations, which grace every page, perfectly complement Alarcon's celebratory verses. Bursting with color and energy, Gonzalez' work is a stunning blend of realistic and fantastic images. Her best illustrations are rich in details that invite the eye to linger in pleasure.<br />In the poem &quot;We Are Trees,&quot; Alarcon compares human beings to trees, and notes that while &quot;our roots / connect,&quot; our branches also &quot;reach out / to other branches.&quot; And this philosophy seems to be at the heart of Alarcon's work. While celebrating a particular family and culture, &quot;From the Bellybutton of the Moon&quot; also explores universal ideas which are relevant to all families and all cultures. And thus should this book be enjoyed by children--and adults--of all cultures.ich are relevant to all families and all cultures.

This anthology is a stunning achievement. The poets represent a multigenerational group of men and women. These poets also represent many different cultural heritages: Native American, Jewish, Asian, Latina, and more. There is a particularly strong representation of African-American poets: Essex Hemphill, Audre Lorde, Cheryl Clarke, and many, many more.<br />The innovative introduction is written in the form of a dialogue between coeditors Morse and Larkin. Addressing the interesting question--Why a gay and lesbian anthology?--Larkin notes that &quot;all kinds of sparks result when you get us all together in one place.&quot; She also observes that the poems begin &quot;to speak to one another&quot; when so gathered. The introduction also recalls some highlights from the history of 20th century lesbian and gay literature, with an emphasis on poetry and anthologies.<br />The authors are a good mix of both well-known and lesser-known poets. The poems themselves cover many different themes and stylistic approaches. Some of the many highlights include Alexis De Veaux's narrative poem &quot;The Sisters&quot;; Maurice Kenny's &quot;Winkte,&quot; a celebration of the gay Native American experience; and Irena Klepfisz's &quot;death camp,&quot; a painful poem about the Holocaust.<br />If you have a passion for poetry, for lesbian literature, for multicultural studies, or for gay men's literature, you will want to add &quot;Gay and Lesbian Poetry in Our Time&quot; to your library. It is a remarkable volume.	2001-01-07

She orally told her story to a third party, who transcribed it. First published in England in 1831, &quot;The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave&quot; is one of the most important narratives of the slave experience in the Americas.<br />This book describes in detail the reality of the slave experience: the dehumanization of Black people, the moral degradation of their masters, and the ever-present violence. Prince's story is also an important early defense of the humanity of people of African descent. She notes that slave masters &quot;think that black people are like cattle, without natural affection. But my heart tells me it is far otherwise.&quot;<br />Prince tells of her labor in the salt ponds of Turk's Island, her conflict with a hired mulatto woman, her spiritual life in the Moravian Church, and many other topics. Ultimately, she celebrates the desire and hope for freedom: &quot;All slaves want to be free.&quot;<br />&quot;The History of Mary Prince&quot; does not quite attain the level of literary craftsmanship and psychological complexity as do some other classic slave narratives (I am thinking in particular of those of Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs). But it is still a powerful, authoritative, and important human testament. Mary Prince declares, &quot;I have been a slave--I have felt what a slave feels, and I know what a slave knows.&quot; We of later centuries need to hear her words.	2001-01-06

Directed towards younger readers, this book tells Emily's story with simple language and plentiful visual aids.<br />Steven Dobson's evocative full-color illustrations are complemented by black-and-white reproductions of photographs, paintings, and other visual records from Emily's era. We get to see Emily at various stages of her life, and we also see her family, her friends, and the home she lived in. Greene's text takes us from Emily's childhood to the end of her life. Greene pays particular attention to Emily's personal relationships, and includes lines from some of her best-known poems.<br />This book is a fine introduction to Emily Dickinson's world and to her art.

And it contains several characteristically &quot;Seussian&quot; characters, including 6-, 8-, and 10-legged creatures that look like they stepped out of a child-friendly science fiction film. I definitely recommend this book to beginning readers, and to older fans of Dr. Seuss.	2001-01-05
2151895:US	51987970	R3BAOEGNUUAZCE	0860917886	303385885	I, Rigoberta Menchu: An Indian Woman in Guatemala	Books	4	224	258	N	N	A &quot;biomythography&quot; that deserves attention	&quot;I, Rigoberta Menchu&quot; is one of those books which seems to be overshadowed by controversy. A Quiche Mayan woman of Guatemala, Rigoberta Menchu told her story orally to anthropologist Elisabeth Burgos-Debray in Paris in 1982. Burgos-Debray transcribed the story and published in Spanish in 1983; Ann Wright's English translation appeared in 1984. The book, which both gave a voice to the Native American culture of Guatemala and exposed the brutality of Guatemala's civil war, became an international sensation. Menchu received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992.<br />Anthropologist David Stoll later uncovered evidence of inconsistencies within Menchu's story. Conservative cultural activists interpreted Stoll's research as discrediting Menchu's story. For example, David Horowitz blasted Menchu as a &quot;liar&quot; and further condemned &quot;I, Rigoberta Menchu&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest hoaxes of the 20th century.&quot; Many derided such attacks on Rigoberta as politically motivated and intellectually dishonest.<br />I think that &quot;I, Rigoberta Menchu&quot; has, perhaps, been misunderstood and misused by people on both sides of the left/right political divide. And so, for that matter, has the work of David Stoll. While he is sharply critical of the book in his own work, &quot;Rigoberta Menchu and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans,&quot; Stoll also corroborates parts of her story. In fact, at the end of his own book Stoll praises &quot;I, Rigoberta Menchu&quot; as a Guatemalan &quot;national epic&quot; (p. 283).<br />Because of all of the accusations and counter-accusations being thrown around by people with conflicting political and intellectual agendas, it is daunting to even approach &quot;I, Rigoberta Menchu.&quot; Nevertheless, I agree with David Stoll that this book is an authentic national epic of Guatemala; I also believe that it is a book which deserves to be read.<br />I look at &quot;I, Rigoberta Menchu&quot; as a &quot;biomythography.&quot; African-American author Audre Lorde used this term to describe her own autobiographical narrative, &quot;Zami: A New Spelling of My Name.&quot; Think of a biomythography as a life story that combines fact with fictionalized, borrowed, or adapted materials in an attempt to arrive at greater truths. I don't mean to suggest that Menchu, or anyone, for that matter, should be excused for misrepresenting facts. But it seems to me that &quot;I, Rigoberta Menchu&quot; gives the reader clues that it is a &quot;biomythography&quot; from the first page of the first chapter: Rigoberta says of her story &quot;I didn't learn it alone,&quot; and further stresses that &quot;it's not only my life, it's also the testimony of my people.&quot;<br />And if you approach the book carefully, you will discover a powerful and fascinating text. It is impossible in the space of a short review to cover all of the highlights of &quot;I, Rigoberta Menchu.&quot; But a few include her description of the interactions among the diverse ethnic groups of Guatemala, her account of Quiche Mayan religious beliefs and practices, and her descriptions of such everyday activities as making tortillas. Particularly fascinating is her account of how Guatemalan revolutionaries interpreted parts of the Bible in order to aid their struggle; at the end of Chapter XVII she describes the Bible as the &quot;main weapon&quot; of her comrades.<br />Yes, Rigoberta has a political agenda. But so did Frederick Douglass and Malcolm X; this does not diminish the value of their autobiographies as both literary texts and historical documents. My advice is to read both &quot;I, Rigoberta Menchu&quot; and David Stoll's biography of Menchu. Read commentaries on the controversy from all parts of the political spectrum. And read other texts about the violence in Guatemala and in other countries rocked by political strife and ethnic tension.

The book is filled with wonderfully rendered images: penguins diving into South Polar water, a colorful Colombian tree frog, wind-whipped trees in New Hampshire, and more.<br />Throughout the book, Jenkins' artistry is impressive. Each illustration is a photograph of one of his collages, which make use of paper of many different colors and textures. He really brings to life such images as the turbulent seas of the Bay of Fundy. And maps throughout the book add to its educational value.

Full-color photographs by Douglas Keister are complemented by the commentaries of Elizabeth Pomada and Michael Larsen.<br />The book focuses on what the authors call the &quot;Colorist Movement&quot; in historic house restoration. In other words, every one of the homes pictured has been painted &quot;in three or more contrasting colors&quot; that &quot;bring out the decorative ruffles and flourishes&quot; of each structure. So if your idea of a Victorian home is a dull, gloomy old mansion in a state of disrepair, be prepared to have that stereotype blown away. These &quot;painted ladies&quot; are some of the most vibrant and beautiful homes I have ever seen.<br />The book captures many different Victorian era styles: Italianate, Second Empire, Steamboat Gothic, Queen Anne, Octagon, Stick, and Victorian eclectic. And don't miss the special appearance by &quot;Lucy,&quot; the elephant-shaped house built by James Lafferty. The colorist approach to these homes truly accentuates the varied vocabulary of Victorian architecture, with its towers, covered verandas, neoclassical pillars, oriel windows, decorated verge boards, and other fanciful details.<br />The book concludes with some helpful tips and resources for those interested in creating their own painted lady. If you are a lover of Victorian era architecture, buy this spectacular book and prepare to indulge in a decadent symphony of visual splendor.	2001-01-04

Venezia uses reproductions of classic paintings, a simple but compelling text, and his own humorous cartoons to bring El Greco and his world to life. This book is part of a series designed to introduce the world's great artists to children.<br />&quot;El Greco&quot; begins with the great painter's birth on the island of Crete in the 16th century, and takes the reader along on El Greco's travels through Europe. Not only does the book include many full-color reproductions of El Greco's works, but it also includes reproductions of works by artists who influenced him. We get a fascinating portrait of El Greco as a family man, traveler, and artistic innovator. Venezia's cartoons provide entertaining complements to the text and reproductions.<br />This is a truly beautiful and educational book. El Greco's remarkable use of color and light, and his passionate treatment of the human form give his work both visual and emotional impact after all these centuries.

This volume is a thoughtful, and frequently melancholy, collection by the great Chilean poet. William O'Daly has translated the poems into a smooth, graceful English. Although I don't believe that &quot;Winter Garden&quot; is quite in the same league as Neruda's greatest works, it is still a deeply moving work that is graced by passages of transcendent beauty.<br />In this collection of short poems Neruda writes about love, death, nature, and other topics. The natural world is a particularly rich presence: fields, apple trees, Andean snow, &quot;the coasts of Chile,&quot; birds in flight, and more appear throughout the book.<br />Neruda is particularly moving when reflecting upon his lifelong quest to fulfil the poet's duty. It is heartbreaking when he laments, &quot;I didn't have enough time or ink for everyone&quot; and asks forgiveness &quot;from anyone not here&quot; (in the poem &quot;For All to Know&quot;). If you have been moved by the other great works of Neruda, or if you simply appreciate beautiful and emotionally rich poetry, you will want to read &quot;Winter Garden.&quot;	2001-01-02

The text gives interesting facts about each species. And the photographs capture many unforgettable images: a narwhal's tusk breaking the water, a mother polar bear cuddling with her cubs, a lone Arctic wolf standing atop a frosty hill, and more. Both beautiful and educational, this book impressed me greatly.	2000-12-31

This is an eclectic collection in terms of architectural style: Italianate, Second Empire, Carpenter's Gothic, &quot;steamboat,&quot; octagon, and other elements can be found throughout the book. The houses come from towns throughout the northwestern United States, as well as from Canada.<br />Most of the photographs are by Edmund V. Gillon, and his excellent work is accompanied by the commentaries of Clay Lancaster. Although Lancaster's insights are informative and frequently entertaining, he often uses a disparaging tone which is unnecessary, and which some might find arrogant.<br />Throughout the book Lancaster uses phrases such as &quot;a strange conglomeration&quot; (plate 5), &quot;a tight clutter of naive elements&quot; (plate 16), &quot;dull proportions&quot; (plate 53), and &quot;[m]ore gross than odd&quot; (plate 92) in discussing various houses. I think it would have been better to simply have described the stylistic classifications of the architectural elements, and left value judgments to each individual reader.<br />Despite my dissatisfaction with some of the commentaries, I find &quot;Victorian Houses&quot; to be an excellent book. It is a superb record of and tribute to a remarkable period in North American home architecture. Mansard roofs, abundant verandas, ornate iron cresting, elegant pillars, towers, cupolas--all this and more can be found in here. If you love Victorian houses, you will definitely want this book.	2000-12-31

The collection of poems entitled &quot;A Tree Within&quot; represents one of his most memorable achievements. A remarkable diverse blend of short lyrics and longer, Whitmanesque creations, &quot;A Tree Within&quot; is definitely a collection that bears careful reading and re-reading.<br />The book is richly studded with multicultural references and allusions--to Epictetus, Buddha, Gilgamesh, Jack the Ripper, the Aztecs, Don Quixote, and many, many, more. But Paz is not merely trying to dazzle us with his knowledge. He is also introspective and revealing. He struggles with deep questions about language, love, and other concerns.<br />Paz seems to be searching both for an ideal poetic language, and for a form of connectedness that transcends language--a paradoxical quest, yet pure Paz. When he writes &quot;Man's word / is the daughter of death&quot; (in the poem &quot;To Talk&quot;), it strikes me as both a tragically naked confession of inadequacy and a moment of serene liberation. At other times, Paz seems, like Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, to be groping towards the creation of a sort of &quot;secular scripture&quot; for the (post)modern age.<br />In the poem &quot;I Speak of the City,&quot; Paz writes, &quot;I speak of our public history, and of our secret history, yours and mine.&quot; The histories recorded by this visionary genius are certainly some of the most important literary creations of the 20th century.	2000-12-29

This book consists of an open letter to Baldwin's nephew, along with an extended autobiographical essay. Throughout the book, Baldwin writes with insight and compassion about the complexities of race in the United States.<br />Baldwin writes of his spiritual crisis as a teenager--a crisis which led to his career as a youth minister in an African-American Christian church. He writes bitterly of his ultimate disillusionment with the emptiness and hypocrisy he found in the church. Baldwin also writes of his meeting with Elijah Muhammad, the fiery leader of the Nation of Islam sect and mentor to controversial Black leader Malcolm X.<br />Baldwin's testament is a harsh critique of 20th century Christendom. Reflecting upon the rise of the Nazis in one of the world's most &quot;Christian&quot; nations, Baldwin declares, &quot;From my own point of view, the fact of the Third Reich alone makes obsolete forever any question of Christian superiority, except in technological terms.&quot;<br />&quot;The Fire Next time&quot; is both an illuminating historical document of a turbulent era, and a superb piece of literary craftsmanship. All those interested in the art of nonfiction prose should take time to experience Baldwin's mastery of the medium. But even more importantly, we should all take time to consider his ideas on race, on religion, on prejudice, and on hope.	2000-12-29

Although the book's length of 48 pages limits the amount of information that the author can share, the straightforward text and beautiful full-color photographs make this book a good addition to the family library.<br />The animals discussed in the book are grouped according to four geographic regions: forests, mountains, grasslands, and the water's edge. The species pictured include the toucan, the spider monkey, the guanaco, and many more. The book is full of stunning images: the colorful coils of the emerald tree boa, the predatory beauty of the jaguar, the majesty of the Andean condor in flight. Read the book and marvel at the wonders of nature.	2000-12-29

Seymour Simon's &quot;Wild Babies&quot; is a good book for those interested in this topic. Directed towards younger readers, this book covers animal babies of many different species and geographic regions: kangaroos, emperor penguins, dolphins, alligators, giraffes, and more.<br />Each of the 13 species profiles consists of a two-page spread: a full-color, full page photograph on one page, with a simply written but informative text on the facing page. The book is full of memorable images: an elephant matriarch guarding her herd's babies, a polar bear cub and mother ambling across the arctic landscape, a baboon family engaged in a relaxing grooming session, and more. This is an outstanding book for the family library.	2000-12-28

Keith Bonn's &quot;Army Officer's Guide&quot; is a well-written and comprehensive manual for officers serving in the United States Army. But Lieutenant Colonel Bonn's book is also a superb reference work for anybody with an interest in this esteemed institution. The book was in its 48th edition (wow!) at the time of this review.<br />Bonn has packed a tremendous amount of useful and fascinating information into 639 pages. The visual appeal of the book is enhanced by a wealth of charts, diagrams, and other illustrations. Detailed drawings of uniforms and insignia, together with a full-color section on Army medals, ribbons, and badges, are an integral part of the &quot;Guide.&quot; Another nice touch is the inclusion of a 1962 address by General Douglas MacArthur as the preface to the book.<br />It would be impossible in the space of a short review to summarize all of the areas covered in the book. But some of the sections that most impressed me included Bonn's detailed profiles of the various branches of the officers' corps (Infantry, Adjutant General, etc.) and his listing of professional movies and videos. Bonn also goes beyond merely providing facts by dealing with such philosophical issues as courage and leadership. This book is an essential reference work both for every library, and for every individual with a personal or professional interest in the U.S. Army.	2000-12-28

But if you can get past the book's sensationalistic tone, you will find many excellent photographs and interesting facts. The book briefly discusses several species of shark (great white, leopard, thresher, etc.), as well as many other potentially dangerous marine animals: octopi, jellyfish, rays, walruses, sea snakes, and more.<br />Although the author does point out that more people die from bee stings than from shark attacks, the book is still far from charitable to these unfairly maligned creatures. So enjoy &quot;The Really Sinister Savage Shark&quot; with your child, but be prepared to give the shark's side of the story!	2000-12-28

Rey's &quot;Curious George&quot; is, without a doubt, a classic children's book which still has great appeal. But the book has certain unsettling elements which may bother both parents and children.<br />The simple text and colorful pictures tell the story of George, a lovable and mischievous monkey who is abducted in Africa and taken to live in a far-off land. The opening sequence--with George bagged and immobilized prior to being shipped off--sets the tone for some of the disturbing images to follow. George nearly drowning, George imprisoned--rarely have the heroes of children's books been subjected to such frightening treatment.<br />The whole moral issue of the illegal animal trade is ignored. Parents will also probably not appreciate episodes in which George smokes a pipe and engages in other unhealthy or foolish activities.<br />Despite these problematic aspects to the book, George is an undeniably appealing character, and the marvelous illustrations really bring him to life. Furthermore, the final section of the book is a real triumph of artistry and imagination. In a way, the curious primate is a precursor to Bart Simpson and other troublemaking heroes of later books and TV shows. My advice? Buy the book. Read it and enjoy it with your favorite child. But be prepared, in an age-appropriate manner, to frankly discuss some of the troublesome aspects of the book with your child.	2000-12-28

This book brings together essays, speeches, journal entries, and an illuminating dialogue between Lorde and sister poet Adrienne Rich. While each piece stands alone as a complete and thought-provoking gem, the book as a whole constitutes one of the most extraordinary intellectual testaments of the 20th century.<br />Lorde writes from her perspective as a Black woman, a lesbian, a feminist, a poet, a mother, a teacher, and a cultural activist. Her voice is forthright and unsparing in moral outrage, yet filled with hope and poetic beauty. One of the core themes unifying this collection is her incisive analysis of the interlocking, overlapping axes of difference, privilege, abuse, and resistance. As she deconstructs such phenomena as homophobia, racism, and sexism, Lorde is both intellectually ambitious and down-to-earth; in her arguments with academic figures, she never forgets the real impact of discrimination and violence upon those who live outside the relatively privileged worlds of academia.<br />Each piece in &quot;Sister Outsider&quot; makes a unique contribution to the overall impact of the book. &quot;Notes from a Trip to Russia&quot; is a fascinating historical document from the Cold War era. &quot;Poetry Is Not a Luxury&quot; serves as an important part of Lorde's artistic manifesto. &quot;An Open Letter to Mary Daly&quot; offers an illuminating glimpse into some of the tensions within the feminist movement of the 1970s. And &quot;Grenada Revisited&quot; is a powerful counterpoint to the Reaganite view of a military action in the Caribbean. The other eleven pieces are equally thought-provoking.<br />In the essay &quot;The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House,&quot; Lorde expands upon the title statement by adding, &quot;They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change.&quot; Lorde's powerful writings may just give us readers some real tools that we can use to bring about &quot;real change&quot;--both within ourselves and in our society.by adding, &quot;They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change.&quot; Lorde's powerful writings may just give us readers some real tools that we can use to bring about &quot;real change&quot;--both within ourselves and in our society.	2000-12-27

Books	4	40	43	N	N	An impassioned plea from a remarkable scientist	The story of Wilhelm Reich is one of the most frightening and shocking episodes in American history. An innovative scientist and psychoanalyst, Dr. Reich upset many with his unorthodox views on sex, physics, and other branches of knowledge. He was ultimately convicted in a United States court; his writings were burned by government authorities (!), and Reich died in prison in 1957. &quot;Listen, Little Man!&quot; is Reich's very personal defense of his own life and work; the book also represents his bold diagnosis of the disorder which he felt pervaded the human world.<br />&quot;Listen, Little Man!&quot; is a powerful, but problematic piece of literature. Reich seems to have a Messiah complex, and the book often sounds like a rambling, preachy rant. Despite this often strident tone, however, &quot;Listen, Little Man!&quot; is rich in insights into the human condition. And Reich's compassion for humanity shines through.<br />In the book, Reich reflects upon many topics: his own discovery of &quot;orgone&quot; energy, the persecution of Galileo, the rise of the Nazis in Germany, the racial discrimination directed against African-American singer Marian Anderson, and more. Ultimately, he expresses hope that he will be vindicated by history.<br />Those interested in Reich's own testament should also read Robert Anton Wilson's brilliant play &quot;Wilhelm Reich in Hell,&quot; a work which is very sympathetic to the embattled scientist. But first read &quot;Listen, Little Man!&quot;; we, as a human race, cannot afford to forget Reich's tragic story.	2000-12-27

This gifted writer from Argentina writes stories that can be  nightmarish, comic, disturbing, erotic, playful, Kafkaesque, brutal and witty.<br />Valenzuela takes us to many different places, and introduces us to many different people. The mind of a suicidal five year old, a young couple's visit to Venice, the twisted rites of a religious cult, the lonely gaiety of a dance hall, a torturer's chamber--these are a few of her narrative arenas. In many of her stories, Valenzuela plays with the conventions of the art of fiction. In one cluster of stories, she revisits and reimagines the female protagonists of traditional fairy tales; in the remarkable final story, she juxtaposes a tale of sexual violence with a bizarre, bestiality-tinged love story.<br />At times, Valenzuela's writing brings to mind the fictional achievements of Jorge Luis Borges, Mario Vargas Llosa, and some of the other experimentalists of Latin America. But Valenzuela's is a wholly original voice. Check out &quot;Symmetries&quot; and prepare your brain for an odd mixture of pleasure and shock.	2000-12-23

That, in a sentence, is the story behind &quot;Haiku: This Other World,&quot; a collection of 817 haiku by Richard Wright. But this book is more than just an extraordinary cross-cultural tour-de-force; it is the incandescent testament of a truly visionary artist.<br />The haiku genre sounds like a simple poetic format: three lines, the first and third containing five syllables, the second containing seven. Wright used this format to create poetic gems of great power and variety. Many of his haiku employ an anthropomorphizing technique in which various phenomena are endowed with awareness and emotion: &quot; The sudden thunder / Startles the magnolias / To a deeper white&quot; (#228).<br />His language is often startling in its raw earthiness, and often the haiku are touched with humor or gentle tragedy: &quot;Two flies locked in love / Were hit by a newspaper / And died together&quot; (#486). Wright often uses memorable poetic imagery, and many of his poems invite the reader to partake of a sort of altered state of consciousness: &quot;Standing in the field / I hear the whispering of / Snowflake to snowflake&quot; (#489).<br />The tone of the book is often melancholy. This collection reminded me of the work of two other great American poets: Emily Dickinson and Stephen Crane. Like those two, Wright is a sort of secular prophet whose visions of the world point to deeper, and often unsettling, truths. This book is an artistic triumph, and its posthumous publication is an enduring tribute to this great writer.	2000-12-22

The cartoony illustrations of the humanoid bears are visually delightful, and the easy-to-read text is great for younger readers.<br />Although this book is meant for an audience of young children, I must admit that, as an adult reader, I found it quite enjoyable. How can you resist lines like &quot;May we? May we? / May we, please, / dip our tootsies / in the seas?&quot;<br />This book portrays a family that genuinely enjoys spending time together. And it even teaches a lesson in the virtue of patience. This Bears romp is a great choice for the beginning reader.	2000-12-21

Paz, who had served as his nation's ambassador to India, writes with insight and obvious affection for his subject.<br />Paz is a masterful prose writer. His style is smooth and clear, and full of sage-like statements. Consider this observation: &quot;Dialogue between a poet and a saint is difficult because a poet, before speaking, must hear others--that is to say, the language, which belongs to everyone and to no one. A saint speaks with God or with himself, two forms of silence&quot; (p. 118).<br />Paz covers many topics: India's ancient history, the conflict between Hindus and Muslims, the caste system, classical Sanskrit poetry, and more. But, as he notes, the book is not meant to be an exhaustive scholarly treatise. Rather, it is a very personal view of India: &quot;this book. . . is the child not of knowledge but of love&quot; (33). And as such, the book is rich in interesting anecdotes and fascinating insights, from Paz' account of his meeting with the guru Mother Ananda Mai to his reflection on the influence of Rabindranath Tagore upon Pablo Neruda.<br />&quot;In Light of India&quot; is a marvelous companion volume to Salman Rushdie's &quot;The Jaguar Smile&quot;: in that volume of essays, a writer from the Indian subcontinent reflects upon a Latin American country (the reverse of Paz' project). But on its own, Paz' book is a wonderful volume both for fans of Latin American literature and for those interested in India.	2000-12-21

As of this review, &quot;Total Television&quot; is in its fourth edition.<br />The book is basically an alphabetical encyclopedia of thousands of television programs in every possible genre: dramas, sitcoms, game shows, cartoons, and more. Each entry lists the series' air dates, principal performers, and other relevant data.<br />In addition to the main body of encyclopedic entries, the book includes a wealth of supplemental features: lists of Emmy winners, a chronological gathering of one-shot specials, and more. Particularly interesting are the programming grids, which show the nightly lineups on each network for each night of the week. You can turn to a season (say, 1951-52) and see what choices the American TV viewer had each night! This feature is great for historians.<br />Although most of the entries on each series are brief, McNeill spends more time and space on certain series of outstanding impact. These extended articles on &quot;All in the Family,&quot; &quot;CBS Evening News,&quot; &quot;Dallas,&quot; &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show,&quot; and more are truly fascinating.<br />TV has been derided by many with such epithets as &quot;the Boob Tube&quot; and &quot;The Idiot Box.&quot; On the other hand, it was praised in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as &quot;teacher, mother. . . secret lover.&quot; McNeill captures TV in all of its facets: from the depths of inanity to the heights of cultural significance. This book is a great achievement whose reputation, I believe, will increase with future editions.	2000-12-19

Written by Shinta Cho and translated into English by Amanda Mayer Stinchecum, this is one of those great children's books that doubles as a work of delightful humor for adults.<br />This book is not only humorous, but also educational. A diagram of the digestive system and other visual aids help to drive home the science of farts. The book is written in a matter-of-fact, totally nonjudgmental tone. The text is supplemented by drawings that have a quirky charm to them.<br />I suppose that some self-appointed watchdogs of &quot;cultural purity&quot; will whine and pout about a book that celebrates the fart as a joyous, and even noble, part of life. But for the rest of us, &quot;The Gas We Pass&quot; is a treasure.	2000-12-19

But the best of them all may be &quot;The Simpsons Guide to Springfield.&quot; Written as a parody of a travel guide, this profusely illustrated book is a superb celebration of Homer's hometown.<br />The book is, like any travel guide, divided up into several sections: Lodging, Dining, Shopping, etc. Along the way are a number of brilliant parodic features. There are essays written by &quot;Simpsons&quot; characters (example: Rev. Lovejoy's guide to worship in Springfield); sidebars with short quotes from many Springfield residents (Dr. Nick Riviera, Martin Prince, and more); another series of sidebars highlighting many of the historic artifacts of Springfield (Jebediah Springfield's prosthetic tongue, the trillion-dollar bill, etc); and much more. From a map of Itchy and Scratchy land to the marquee of the Googolplex, this book is full of glorious detail.<br />Yes, &quot;the Simpsons&quot; is an entertaining TV show, and this book is a witty and well-constructed tribute to that series. But I think there's something more here. The world of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is like the world of &quot;Star Trek,&quot; J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, or some of the other great fictional universes of human creativity: it is an enormously rich and detailed alternate world with its own inner logic and mythic history. &quot;The Simpsons Guide to Springfield&quot; captures this compelling alternate universe in all its comic glory.	2000-12-18

Since the initial 1969-74 run of the series, the Bradys have returned in numerous TV, musical, and motion picture incarnations. Elizabeth Moran's &quot;Bradymania&quot; is an essential guide to the Brady universe.<br />Moran's well-written book includes profiles of both the major Brady characters and the actors who played them, an episode guide to the original series, a profile of &quot;Brady&quot; creator Sherwood Schwartz, a guide to the Brady TV spin-offs, and many other fascinating features. There are even floor plans to the legendary Brady home! And Moran thoughtfully includes Cousin Oliver, the &quot;lost Brady,&quot; in the profiles.<br />The book could have been improved with more detailed information on the &quot;Brady&quot; spin-offs; I think those short-lived shows deserve the same episode-by-episode treatment that the original series gets. But that's a minor complaint. This is a wonderful book, full of great photos and revealing snippets of interviews from cast members. So if, like me, you are a devoted Bradyologist (that is, scholar of all things Brady), you'll want this book for your library.	2000-12-18

And I eagerly look forward to each new edition (I viewed the 6th edition as I prepared this review).<br />This mammoth work contains both a series of essays on major religious traditions and a series of profiles of individual denominations, fellowships, and missions. The profiles on individual religious bodies number well over 2,300 in the 6th edition. Mailing addresses and bibliographic references (when available) for each individual body further add to the book's usefulness.<br />Melton covers everything from the largest mainstream denominations to the smallest and most esoteric bodies. His broad editorial vision takes in nearly every conceivable religious tradition: Christianity in all its permutations (Anglican, Lutheran, Pentecostal, etc.), Judaism, Hinduism and other Eastern traditions, Neo-Pagan groups, &quot;flying saucer&quot;-related fellowships, Atheist and Humanist associations, and more. Each entry is written in an objective manner.<br />The latest edition of this book should be in every library in Canada and the United States. Furthermore, serious journalists and scholars of religion will find this to be a useful and fascinating edition to their own private libraries.	2000-12-15

Peopled with a Dickensian crew of colorful characters, &quot;Bartleby&quot; is both a Kafkaesque workplace comedy and a profoundly unsettling tragedy.<br />&quot;Benito Cereno&quot; tells the story of Amasa Delano, a Massachusetts-based merchant captain who encounters the Spanish vessel &quot;San Dominick&quot; off the coast of Chile. What unfolds is a disturbing blend of mystery and psychological horror as Delano boards the slave ship, whose crew has been decimated by illness, and meets her captain, Benito Cereno, and his Black servant Babo. &quot;Benito Cereno&quot; is one of the greatest fictional works about the era of slavery; Melville brilliantly satirizes white arrogance while exploring the complex world of 19th century race relations.<br />Together, &quot;Bartleby&quot; and &quot;Benito Cereno&quot; constitute a superb introduction to a writer of supreme skill. These are works of fiction whose power endures.	2000-12-15

Roberts' 341 primary bibliographic entries, each one accompanied by an informative annotation, made available a vast body of work about the lives of Black lesbians.<br />Roberts' book includes a foreword by Barbara Smith, a Black lesbian writer who continues to be a forceful presence as a writer and activist (see, for example, Smith's 1999 essay collection &quot;The Truth That Never Hurts,&quot; published by Rutgers University Press). In her foreword Smith declares, &quot;This book should be available in every library in this country, particularly those in Black communities.&quot;<br />Roberts' entries cover six primary areas of study: &quot;Lives and Lifestyles&quot;; &quot;Oppression, Resistance, and Liberation&quot;; &quot;Literature and Criticism&quot;; &quot;Music and Musicians&quot;; &quot;Periodicals&quot;; and &quot;Research, Reference, and Popular Studies.&quot; A marvelous gallery of photographs and an appendix of materials related to a &quot;lesbian witch hunt&quot; on a U.S. Navy ship further add to the book's value.<br />A wealth of books, magazine articles, recordings, and other materials are covered. Particularly fascinating is the section on literature and criticism, which undoubtedly introduced such Black women writers as Becky Birtha, SDiane Bogus, Anita Cornwell, and Pat Parker to many readers for the first time.<br />These writers are just part of a remarkable gathering of Black lesbian lives. The priestess of a witches' coven, a joyfully recovering drug addict, the co-parent of a child conceived through artificial insemination--these and many, many more have their stories made more accessible thanks to Roberts' careful scholarship.<br />In the foreword Barbara Smith declares, &quot;The book you are holding in your hand is a kind of miracle.&quot; In a society that is often stifled by the triplet horrors of racism, sexism, and homophobia, &quot;Black Lesbians&quot; is indeed a miracle.

Campbell's &quot;Handbook of Scripts and Alphabets&quot; is a stripped-down guide to 40 writing systems from around the world. Alphabetically arranged from &quot;Arabic&quot; to &quot;Tibetan,&quot; each entry contains a brief textual description of each writing system, along with a table in which each character is presented along with a transliteration into the Roman alphabet. The only departure from this format is for a non-phonetic system like Chinese.<br />Because of this no-frills format, there is virtually no depiction of the writing systems as actually used; all we see are the individual characters arranged in grids. The only real illustration is a photograph of a manuscript written in Roman characters; other than that, the various characters are oddly lifeless on the page. It would have been nice to see some lines from a poem, or perhaps a clipping from a newspaper for each script.<br />This drawback aside, &quot;Handbook of Scripts and Alphabets&quot; is an informative work. And, despite the rigid presentation of the various scripts, I find great variety and beauty in this gathering of iconic characters. The loops and curls of the Tamil script, the mathematical regularity of the Cree syllabary, the bold lines of the Batak script--all these and more are a pleasure to behold.	2000-12-15

Practicing Wiccans themselves, Tuitean and Daniels share a wealth of data in a very readable style.<br />Despite its length of only 128 pages, the book covers a good range of subjects: the history of Wicca, Wiccan beliefs and practices, coven organization, festivals and rites of passage, ritual tools, etc. I was particularly fascinated by the brief history of Wicca, which covers the work of Gerald Gardner and other pioneers.<br />The authors describe Wicca as &quot;a modern version of the original pre-Christian, European shamanic religious tradition.&quot; In addition to putting out basic information about Wicca, the authors also clearly mean to dispel &quot;misunderstanding and. . . misconceptions&quot; about this religion and its adherents.<br />Although I do not practice Wicca myself, I am a strong believer in religious tolerance and interfaith education. I thus salute Tuitean and Daniels for their work on this book. If &quot;Pocket Guide to Wicca&quot; helps to empower Wiccans and to dispel prejudice among non-Wiccans, then all people, regardless of religious identity, will benefit.	2000-12-15

This is a bilingual work; the majority of the poems are written in English, and several are written either in Spanish or in a mixture of the two languages. Himself a Puerto Rican who has lived in New York City, Laviera has effectively captured the spirit of a multilingual culture.<br />Laviera deals with many themes and subjects: poverty, United States iconography, history, the work of the poet, multilingualism, and the complexities of ethnic identity. In his writing one can find both pain and joy, all expressed in a powerful vernacular language.<br />As a whole, &quot;Mainstream Ethics&quot; can be read as a unified piece of art, but each individual poem in the collection also shines. Laviera starts out with &quot;lady liberty,&quot; in which the Statue of Liberty herself reflects upon both the problems and the potential of the United States. I read this poem as a wonderful companion piece to Emma Lazarus' beloved poem &quot;The New Colossus.&quot;<br />Other standouts include &quot;latero story,&quot; told by a welfare recipient, and &quot;melao,&quot; about a Puerto Rican-born New Yorker whose son speaks &quot;black american soul english talk.&quot; Alternatingly angry, affectionate, satirical, and hopeful, Laviera writes words that are deeply rooted in urban reality, but always reaching towards transcendent truths.	2000-12-13

The book contains an interview, three short essays, and a lengthy collection of excerpts from the journal she kept during her battle against cancer.<br />In the book, Lorde addresses many of the themes which she has explored in past works: racism, lesbian culture, political activism, and more. The only sour note is the interview, &quot;Sadomasochism: Not About Condemnation,&quot; in which Lorde bitterly critiques a particular sexual subculture within the lesbian community. Lorde's patronizing tone reminded me of the attitude that anti-gay heterosexuals often adopt when talking about the lesbian community! And lines like &quot;Liberalism allows pornography and has allowed wife beating as First Amendment rights&quot; do not help Lorde's credibility.<br />But if you skip the interview, you will find the rest of the book to be both politically incisive and often very moving. I particularly enjoyed the essay &quot;Turning the Beat Around: Lesbian Parenting 1986,&quot; in which Lorde, a Black lesbian who co-parented a daughter and a son with her white woman lover, reflects on the joy and challenge of parenting.<br />And the excerpts from her journal are a beautiful testament to Lorde's own courage in her fight against cancer. The excerpts record her travels to Berlin, Germany; Melbourne, Australia; and other places as she struggled to maintain her physical health while continuing her work as a cultural activist.<br />In one of her journal excerpts, Lorde writes, &quot;Survival isn't some theory operating in a vacuum. It's a matter of my everyday life and making decisions.&quot; Very true. And &quot;A Burst of Light&quot; is a vibrant celebration of survival.	2000-12-13

Rich in clever rhymes and memorable images, this book scores a literary home run on nearly every page.<br />Directed towards early readers, &quot;One Fish&quot; uses simple language in its funny rhymes. Seuss mixes his own created words together with standard vocabulary, resulting in such memorable lines as &quot;just jump on the hump of the Wump of Gump.&quot; And these rhymes are accompanied by a rich variety of images that can only be described as &quot;Seussian&quot;: A mother fish pushing her offspring in a baby carriage, a bed being commandeered by a menagerie of animals, and more.<br />Futhermore, in &quot;One Fish&quot; Dr. Seuss introduces us to a wonderful assortment of Seussian creatures: the singing Ying, the hopping Yop, a truly bizarre creature known simply as &quot;Clark,&quot; and many more. These images are sure to energize the imaginations of both children and adults.<br />Seuss's images range from the joyful to the eerie, from the baroque to the earthy. I give &quot;One Fish&quot; my most enthusiastic recommendation.	2000-12-13

This collection is stunning in its diversity. Essays, short stories, poems, and excerpts from longer works are included. The authors represent thirteen different nations from all over the Latin American world: Chile, Guatemala, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Brazil, and more. The authors also represent several generations of women writers: the earliest was born in 1886, and the youngest in 1955. Short author bios, which include some bibliographic references, are included at the end of the volume.<br />This anthology celebrates the 10th anniversary of White Pine Press's Secret Weavers Series, and thus includes excerpts from the previous 12 volumes in this series devoted to Latin American women writers. A number of different translators worked to make these selections available in English.<br />The selections cover a wide range of themes: ethnic identity, history, violence, sexual politics, the craft of writing, and more. It is difficult to pick out just a few favorites from the dozens of marvelous pieces, but some of the best include &quot;The Ineffable,&quot; Delmira Agustini's poem about the burden and joy of being a writer; &quot;Cage Number One,&quot; Dora Alonso's moving short story which takes us into the mind of a monkey in a zoo; &quot;Protest,&quot; Romelia Alarcon de Folgar's poem which employs imagery that is reminiscent of Walt Whitman; and &quot;Dirty Words,&quot; Luisa Valenzuela's stunning essay which celebrates the ecstasies of forbidden language.<br />Of course, in mentioning those pieces I don't mean to take away from the many other writers in &quot;Secret Weavers&quot;: Julia de Burgos, Ilke Brunhilde Laurito, Alejandra Pizarnik, and many, many more. This is a magnificent collection, filled with passion, politics, and prophetic vision. For those interested in women's studies, Latin American studies, or 20th century literature, this is an essential anthology.s, or 20th century literature, this is an essential anthology.	2000-12-13

According to one estimate, more than 6 thousand ex-slaves left behind, in various formats, written testimonies of their experience. One of the most important of these testimonies is &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,&quot; by Harriet Jacobs. First published in 1861, it is still a powerful piece of literature.<br />Jacobs' narrative, although validated as factual by such 20th century scholars as Jean Fagan Yellin, is written in an almost novelistic style. As a narrative, it is well-structured and vividly written. Jacobs is an outstanding narrator; her voice is rich in moral outrage and psychological insight.<br />Jacobs writes movingly of the terrible sufferings of Black slaves. But equally fascinating is her portrayal of the whites who were involved in the terrible institution of slavery. Her master and mistress are not one-dimensional villains; rather, her layered portrait depicts them as pathetic individuals who are psychologically crippled by the overlapping scourges of white supremacy and male chauvinism. Their cruelty seems to reflect an inner pathology.<br />Elsewhere in the book Jacobs reveals the southern whites' fears of slave revolts, and she paints a richly satiric portrait of a white clergyman who exploits the Bible and Christian theology as &quot;tools&quot; with which to psychologically intimidate the slave population.<br />&quot;Incidents&quot; is a fascinating text that will amply reward the attentive reader. But this is more than just a fine piece of writing; it is also the powerful personal testament of a woman who survived a harrowing ordeal and emerged as a bold advocate of justice.	2000-12-12

Books	4	55	62	N	N	The final (?) testament of a diabolical prophet	Anton Szandor LaVey, author/compiler of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; and founder of the notorious Church of Satan, certainly had a unique position in late 20th century culture. &quot;Satan Speaks!&quot;, published after his death, represents the final testament of this demonic prophet. Whether or not you are a Satanist, you just might find this book to be an interesting, provocative, and even enjoyable read.<br />A collection of short essays, &quot;Satan Speaks!&quot; varies in quality. Some of the selections strike me as underdeveloped, self-indulgent rants: I refer particularly to &quot;Child Abuse,&quot; &quot;Some Professionals and a Poem,&quot; and others. But even some of these grouchy tirades have appealing flashes of dark humor; try &quot;Don't Bathe,&quot; LaVey's celebration of body odor.<br />And the best of these essays range from delightful exercises in creative misanthropy to truly thought-provoking analyses of popular culture. LaVey speculates on the connections between the Jew and the Satanist in &quot;A Plan,&quot; discusses the potential of &quot;The Witch's Shoe as Weaponry&quot; in the essay of that title, and issues a fascinating manifesto for Satanic cultural activism in &quot;The Horns of a Dilemma.&quot;<br />And throughout the book one can find marvelously quotable aphorisms from the man known as the Black Pope. Examples: &quot;Is it coincidence that the most important word to a Satanist is 'Why?'&quot; (from &quot;The Third Side&quot;); &quot;Did Charlie Chaplin have a Hitler moustache, or vice versa?&quot; (from &quot;The Jewish Question&quot;); or &quot;Don't bomb abortion clinics unless you happen to need one, and they won't take you&quot; (from &quot;My Enemy&quot;).<br />&quot;Traditional&quot; religionists and other more &quot;proper&quot; folk may cringe at LaVey's writings, but to the adventurous reader, &quot;Satan Speaks!&quot; is a deliciously stocked candy store. Was this truly LaVey's final testament, or are there hidden demonic manuscripts of his waiting to be unleashed upon a trembling world? Stay tuned!ic manuscripts of his waiting to be unleashed upon a trembling world? Stay tuned!	2000-12-11

Latimer and Karen Stray Nolting, is a beautiful and informative guide to this fascinating family of insects. A well-written introduction gives basic information about butterfly anatomy, the butterfly life cycle, and other relevant matters. But the main body of the book consists of individual profiles of many major species of butterfly.<br />Each two-page spread consists of text, a full-color photograph of a representative insect, and excellent full-color drawings by artist Amy Bartlett Wright. Highlighted sections of each spread focus on each butterfly's habitat, its favorite plants, and the best times of the year that it can be seen. By the time you finish the book, you will be familiar with the Tiger Swallowtail, the Variegated Fritillary, the Red Admiral, and many other colorful species.<br />This is a fascinating book which will be useful to both adventurous types who like to view butterflies in the wild and to those who prefer to read about butterflies from the comfort of their study. And although the book is marketed for young people, I believe it would also be appealing to adults. Ultimately, the authors and illustrator have created a beautiful tribute to a marvelous family of living beings.	2000-12-11

I can't think of &quot;The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson&quot; as simply a volume of poetry. Rather, it seems to me to be the uninhibited testament of a latter-day prophetess; it reads like the visions of a rare mind who pierced through the prisons of convention, and who dared to record what she perceived.<br />Forget any preconceptions you may have had about Dickinson, and start reading the book. As a whole, this collection is a stunning exploration of many themes and images: the world of nature, metaphysics, human emotion, and more.  And throughout, these short verses radiate with psychological insight.<br />And if you read with the attentiveness that these poems deserve, you will discover many treasures. I have been a particular fan of Dickinson's &quot;blasphemous&quot; verses, in which she deconstructs the conventions of mainstream religiosity, and of her erotic poems, which celebrate the sensuous delights of the human and nonhuman worlds. Check out such gems as #324 (&quot;Some keep the Sabbath going to Church-- / I keep it, staying at Home&quot;) or #339 (&quot;My Cactus--splits her Beard / To show her throat&quot;). Dickinson is full of surprises, all written in a style that is stunning and subtly seductive.<br />Dickinson writes, &quot;Exhilaration--is within-- / There can no Outer Wine / So royally intoxicate / As that diviner Brand&quot; (#383). But if you must rely on an &quot;Outer Wine,&quot; dip into the &quot;Complete Poems&quot; and get high on Emily. It's an addiction that's good for you.	2000-12-10

Author Kathleen Krull and illustrator David Diaz have done an outstanding job in bringing to life the story of Olympic heroine Wilma Rudolph, the African-American runner who overcame a disabling childhood illness and ultimately triumphed at the 1960 Rome Olympics.<br />Krull tells Wilma's story in a simple, straightforward way that should appeal to young readers. Her prose is accompanied by Diaz's truly memorable artwork. His full-color illustrations, which strike a perfect balance between realism and stylization, really convey the emotion of each stage in Wilma's incredible journey.<br />&quot;Wilma Unlimited&quot; is a story of working hard and overcoming adversity. Although much of the story is set in the world of sports, the message of this book is universal. If your child is struggling with some problem or setback and needs a book to renew his/her sense of hope, this might be the ideal choice. Krull and Diaz have created a wonderful tribute to a remarkable woman.	2000-12-10

Author John Sergeant has combined an insightful text with detailed floor plans and photographs of the Usonian homes themselves. The result is a book that serves equally well for light browsing and intense study.<br />The book is not without flaws. Some of the floor plans are so tiny that they are difficult to analyze. And the floor plans have no captions labeling each individual room; the reader is left to decipher the plans on his/her own. But these drawbacks aside, this is an excellent work.<br />Sergeant has truly captured the innovative power of Wright's genius. Look at the clustered circles of the Jester house project, the interlocking hexagons of the Bazett house, or the bold &quot;solar-hemicycle&quot; of the second Jacobs house, and you will get a sense of Wright's remarkable vison. Virtually every page brings a stunning image or insight. If you are fascinated by Wright's work in home architecture, you will love this book.	2000-12-08

Turner combines a well-written biography of Ringgold with a wealth of photographs from all phases of the artist's life, full-color reproductions of many of her classic creations, and other interesting materials.<br />An African-American artist who blends African, African-American, and European themes and techniques in her work, Ringgold is a fascinating multicultural creator. This book gives the reader a good sense of the journey she has taken towards her comprehensive artistic vision. It is fascinating, for example, to see a reproduction of da Vinci's &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; together with Ringgold's mixed-media portrayal of African-American children dancing in front of &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; at the Louvre museum in France. Turner's &quot;Faith Ringgold&quot; is a visually stunning book which just may inspire a few artists of the next generation.	2000-12-08

This is a true encyclopedia of the American home.<br />The McAlesters combine an informative introduction with a chapter-by-chapter guide to each of the major styles of home architecture in the United States. Each chapter includes both crisp, detailed line drawings and a wealth of photographs of actual houses themselves. The photographs alone--there are literally hundreds of them--make this book an invaluable reference work.<br />The McAlesters also provide newcomers with a useful primer to the language of home architecture. After reading this book you might find yourself using terms like &quot;hipped dormer,&quot; &quot;decorated verge board,&quot; &quot;roof-line balustrade,&quot; and &quot;ogee arch&quot; when you visit a new neighborhood.<br />From Native American tipis to geodesic domes, from Chateauesque mansions to mobile homes--all this and more is in here.

The protagonist's visit to a country club soon becomes a surreal comedy in which sex, politics, militarism, and economics are all mocked and deconstructed.<br />Along the way, Valenzuela satirizes the U.S. military presence in Latin America, the use of television as a narcotic, and other aspects of 20th century culture. A bizarre cast of characters--the imperious maid Maria, a megalomaniacal military commander, and more--enact scenes that are often funny, often disturbing. And throughout the unsettling refrain is repeated: &quot;Don't think. . . . Thinking's bad for you.&quot;<br />Luisa Valenzuela just might leave you thinking. This is an important work by a major writer of Argentina.	2000-12-07

As the title says, &quot;1001 All Time Best Selling Home Plans&quot; contains a huge number of home designs. Each design is presented in a similar format: detailed plans of each major floor, a short paragraph describing the design, and an artist's rendition (or, in some cases, a photograph) of the home's exterior.<br />This is a truly eclectic collection of plans, ranging from modest cottages to luxurious estates. One- and two-story designs, as well as designs for hillside properties, are represented. Another bonus is the presence of a great variety of architectural styles: Victorian, Pueblo, Greek Revival, Tudor, contemporary, and more.<br />The only drawback to the book is the fact that often more than one design is crammed onto a single page. Thus some of the details are hard to make out. You might find yourself reaching for a magnifying glass on some designs.<br />This negative point aside, this is an outstanding collection.  It would make a great gift for someone interested in home architecture.	2000-12-07

A true illustrated encyclopedia of the American home (as the subtitle says), this book covers a vast range of styles, historical periods, and geographic regions.<br />Each short chapter--beginning with Native American earth lodges and ending with speculative space station housing--covers a specific type of home architecture in the United States. Walker's straightforward prose is accompanied by cutaway drawings, detailed floor plans, and superbly rendered drawings of home exteriors.<br />It would be impossible in a short review to name all of the various styles covered by Walker. He covers everything from such well-known styles as the A-frame and Greek Revival to styles that may be less familiar to some: the baled hay and sod homes of 1890s Nebraska, the silo and yurt homes which gained popularity in the 1970s, and more. Another fascinating part of the book is the presence of many famous homes: Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, Frank Lloyd Wright's Falling Water, and more.<br />Along the way, the reader will encounter many wonderful surprises--check out, for example, the &quot;Elephant House&quot; designed by James Lafferty! &quot;American Shelter&quot; is a book that you can pick up and start reading anywhere. But if you read this from cover to cover, you will have taken a truly epic journey with a master artist-historian.	2000-12-07

Every chapter is full of compelling portraits<br />and memorable insights. He portrays the acts of violence committed<br />against the slave population with graphic brutality; this is an<br />unflinching record of human rights abuse.<br />But the<br />&quot;Narrative&quot; is more than just a cry against injustice. It is<br />also the story of an indomitable young man who defies a corrupt system<br />that was meant to break his spirit. Douglass tells how he gains both<br />literacy and the desire for freedom. This is an unforgettable story of<br />both intellectual and political awakening. It is also a devastating<br />critique of those who used the Bible and the Southern church as tools<br />for the psychological terrorization of the slave population.<br />As a<br />college teacher, I have often used this book in American literature<br />classes. It is truly a story which is relevant for students today. But<br />this is not just a book for academic circles; this is book for all who<br />seek to understand the potential of the human spirit.	2000-12-04

Dr. Seuss's &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; is one of the great classics of children's literature. I'm sure that a less daring author would have left well enough alone. But the good Dr. Seuss had the nerve to write a sequel! And, I'm happy to say, &quot;The Cat in the Hat Comes Back&quot; matches the subversive lunacy and imaginative wit of the Cat's first adventure.<br />The story begins with our narrator, the same little boy from the original &quot;Cat,&quot; shoveling snow with his sister Sally. And, as in the first book, the Cat in the Hat arrives to turn their dull day topsy-turvy.<br />But this is no retread of the first book. The wily Cat has some new tricks to share, and some new friends to introduce to us. Little Cat A, Little Cat B, and the rest--including some brilliant surprises--are wonderful additions to the &quot;Cat&quot; mythos.<br />As in the original, the book has some unsettling nuances. Why are these kids home alone? Just what is that bizarre pink substance in the bathtub? But leave it to the psychologists and literary critics to debate the possible hidden meanings of the book; kids will enjoy the delightful rhymes and wacky illustrations. Congratulations, Dr. Seuss: you have shown that the sequel to a classic can be just as excellent as the beloved original!	2000-12-04

The original Portuguese version by Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis has been rendered into an engaging English by translator Gregory Rabassa.<br />The book's hero, Bras Cubas, is a sort of lovable loser who narrates his own life from beyond the grave. The book is divided up into 160 short chapters, some less than a page long. As the story unfolds we meet a colorful cast of characters: Bras Cubas himself, his beloved Virgilia, the slave Prudencio, the strange philosopher Quincas Borba, and many more.<br />Throughout the novel, Machado de Assis (through his fictional narrator) continually plays games with the conventions of fiction and autobiography. Whether he is instructing the reader to insert Chapter CXXX &quot;between the first and second sentences of Chapter CXXIX&quot; or critiquing his own writing style, Cubas/Machado de Assis is full of surprises that make this novel a literary house of mirrors.<br />And throughout the novel the reader encounters passages of poetic depth and psychological insight. Despite being more than 100 years old, this book has an amazingly modern feel to it. This is a major work in the great tradition of South American fiction.	2000-12-03

But she left behind a body of poetry in which she celebrated life. Parker wrote directly from and about her experiences as an African-American lesbian and feminist, but her work is relevant to readers regardless of their own gender, ethnic heritage, or sexual orientation. Parker's work sparkles with humor and compassion even while it confronts painful subjects.<br />This expanded edition of &quot;Movement in Black,&quot; with a new introduction by sister Black lesbian poet Cheryl Clarke, is a valuable contribution to contemporary literature. In addition to containing the great poems from the previous editions of this book, the new edition contains a rich selection of new poems, as well as Clarke's insightful introduction, a fascinating history of the book's previous incarnations by publisher Nancy K. Bereano, and a collection of tributes by 10 more writers, among them Angela Y. Davis, Audre Lorde, and Barbara Smith.<br />Of course, poetry lovers may want to skip the supplemental material and get right to the poetry. Parker is an American poet in the tradition of Walt Whitman and Langston Hughes. She writes in a raw, forthright vernacular language that addresses the joys and sorrows of real people. She writes about sex, love, prejudice, pain, and friendship. It's hard to pick just a few standouts from this awesome collection. But some of my favorites include &quot;Movement in Black&quot; (from which the title of the entire book is taken), a longer poem that tells the history of the Black woman in America; &quot;The _What_ Liberation Front?&quot;, a humorous poem about a dog who is intent on joining a militant canine liberation organization; and &quot;For the White Person Who Wants to Know How to Be My Friend,&quot; an insightful meditation on the possibility of interracial friendship.<br />This new edition of &quot;Movement in Black&quot; is essential reading for those interested in lesbian literature, African-American studies, and populist poetry. The book is also a beautiful tribute to an amazing woman whose spirit continues to inspire people of all races and sexual identities.African-American studies, and populist poetry.

The book is divided up into chapters, each of which stands alone as a unified and satisfying essay. The book as a whole paints an ironic portrait of Nicaraguan life during the Sandinista revolution.<br />Rushdie makes no claim to be objective; he is sympathetic to the Sandinista government and recalls being given cordial official greetings by some of the major Sandinista figures. But despite this affinity, Rushdie doesn't hesitate to cast a critical, and even satirical, eye on what he sees. In particular, he is wary of the Sandinista policy of press censorship: &quot;[W]hat worries me is that censorship is very seductive. It's so much easier than the alternative.&quot;<br />Rushdie's keen powers of observation take in many of the institutions and personalities of Nicaragua, and he offers pungent insights on some of the racial, linguistic, political, and aesthetic issues facing the nation. &quot;The Jaguar Smile&quot; is particularly fascinating when Rushdie writes of his encounters with such eminent Nicaraguan authors as Gioconda Belli and Sergio Ramirez; reading Rushdie's accounts made me eager to seek out books by these writers.<br />Rushdie's prose--often amiable, occasionally cynical--is a pleasure to read. &quot;The Jaguar Smile&quot; is neither a comprehensive history of Nicaragua nor an unambiguous political manifesto, and should not be viewed as such. But as a skilled writer's record of his impressions of a nation at a crossroads in its history, this book is an impressive achievement.	2000-11-20

But when his birthday arrives he discovers that he has a magical heritage, and the rest of the novel describes his marvelous adventures at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br />Simple enough. But the execution is an absolute delight, and author J.K. Rowling has created a genuine international cultural phenomenon. I believe that the secret to Rowling's smashing success might be broken down into a sort of mathematical equation: (Tolkien + Dickens) x Cleary = Rowling.<br />In other words, she has created a truly magical, yet consistent alternate world (as did J.R.R. Tolkien in his &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; saga), added to that by a propensity to people that world with memorable characters who have a rich assortment of defining quirks (as did Charles Dickens in his many great novels), and multiplied it all by a skill at depicting young people who are realistic and who engage the reader's emotions (as did Beverly Cleary in her novels about Henry Huggins and other characters).<br />I read this book mainly out of curiosity over the endless media hype. And when I did, I discovered a fantastic new world to which I immediately wanted to return, and a cast of individuals to whom I felt immediately connected. And on top of that, I found my vocabulary enriched by an assortment of new words: Quidditch, Muggles, Diagon Alley, Golden Snitch, etc. &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; lives up to--and surpasses--the hype. So whether you ignore or enjoy the media frenzy, read the actual book. You just might get hooked.	2000-11-19

A poet, educator, linguist, political leader, and skilled prose writer, he possessed a truly vast intellect. In these &quot;Selected Writings,&quot; editor Ivan Jaksic and translator Frances M. Lopez-Morillas have made a small sample of his legacy--his collected works in Spanish fill 26 volumes--available to English-speaking readers.<br />Bello's prose and poetry in this anthology focus mainly on the topics of language, literature, education, history, and political science. Some of his more technical writings are a bit dry, and will, I imagine, appeal more to specialists in some of these fields than to the general reader. But to the discriminating general reader, this volume offers a wealth of intellectual delights and insights.<br />Among the book's many fine highlights are Bello's long poem &quot;Allocution to Poetry,&quot; which captures a sweeping vison of Latin America, and an address delivered at the University of Chile in which he prophetically envisions the great Chilean authors who would follow him. His call for universal literacy in &quot;On the Aims of Education&quot; is evidence of a mind truly ahead of its time.<br />Although this is an excellent edition--it includes superb introductory materials, among them a fascinating chronology--there is room for improvement. Some of Bello's more reference-laden writings would, I believe, be more meaningful to a broader audience if they had been accompanied by more extensive annotations. Nevertheless, this is an outstanding book, and an excellent tribute to a man of truly towering intellect.	2000-11-18

Beginning with &quot;the absurd&quot; and ending with &quot;zeugma,&quot; Chris Baldick has assembled a marvelous bestiary of literary terms and has provided concise explanations of each one.<br />Baldick's choices cover a wide range of history, geography, and ideology--from the Senecan tragedy to the campus novel, from the haiku to the Petrarchan sonnet, from Romanticism to Russian Formalism. Particularly useful is his inclusion of many originally non-English terms: &quot;Sturm und Drang,&quot; &quot;bricolage,&quot; and many more.<br />Of course, no project of this nature can be exhaustive, particularly when it is crammed into 246 pages. And yet, I wonder at the rationale behind some of Baldick's inclusions and omissions. Why, for example, is there an entry for Homeric, but none for Dickensian? For the Harlem Renaissance, but not for the Black Arts Movement? For Brechtian, but not for Kafkaesque? For logocentrism, but not for phallocentrism? For science fiction, but not for horror? For braggadocio, but not for tragic mulatta?<br />Nevertheless, this is still one of my favorite reference works. So if you're planning a Festschrift, if you're contemplating a revival of Vorticism, or if you want to spice up your latest jeremiad with some Spoonerisms, check out this book. It will make you feel like a true skald!	2000-11-17

I was captivated by her inquisitive mind and vivacious spirit, which clearly came through in her prose.<br />&quot;A Free Black Girl Before the Civil War&quot; is a selection from the journals of the young Charlotte Forten (Grimke was her married name), all written in 1854. These writings offer a fascinating glimpse into the life of an educated free black girl during the era of slavery. We learn about Charlotte's love for nature, her participation in abolitionist activities, her admiration for the pioneering African American poet Phillis Wheatley, and other topics. Editor Christy Steele and company have provided a rich and colorful assortment of study aids: photographs and illustrations from Charlotte's era, a map of the &quot;Underground Railroad,&quot; a timeline, and other resources. At 32 pages, the book is a lot less intimidating than the adult version which I first read!<br />The book also encourages its young readers to start their own diaries, and offers some tips. A list of relevant Internet sites further adds to the interactive nature of the book. This is an outstanding book for younger readers. Adults who also enjoy it would be wise to seek out the Schomburg Library edition of Charlotte's journals, edited by Brenda Stevenson. Both versions of these historic documents are excellent contributions to the field of African American studies.	2000-11-17

The editors who helm such a project are almost playing god by deciding which authors and which works get into the &quot;canon.&quot; Fortunately, the editors of &quot;The Norton Anthology of African American Literature&quot; have approached their duties with an expansive vision and an evident seriousness of purpose. The result is a collection which, although not without flaws, is a comprehensive and powerful sampling of a great tradition.<br />The editors have chosen a rich selection of works from the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. A good balance of male and female authors is struck. I was particularly impressed by the great range of genres. Poetry, essays, autobiography, short fiction, drama, sermons, song lyrics, and even a few complete short novels are included. Science fiction writers (Octavia Butler, Samuel R. Delany), writers also included in the canon of lesbian and gay literature (Audre Lorde, James Baldwin, Essex Hemphill) and writers whose works have an experimental edge (Adrienne Kennedy, etc.) are included.<br />The extensive author biographies include fascinating information about each writer's life and body of work. Bibliographies and a chronology at the end of the collection are also useful.<br />Of course, no anthology this ambitious is going to please everybody. As much as I liked the book, I still missed the presence of certain favorite authors (Pat Parker, SDiane Bogus, and others). And of the authors represented, there were those for whom I might have chosen some different or additional selections (Audre Lorde's essay &quot;Man Child&quot; would have made an excellent complement to the work already represented). And what about Afro-Latino/a writers like Jesus Colon? With the exception of Puerto Rican-born Arthur Schomburg, they appear to be almost entirely absent.<br />I am sure that others with a love for and expertise in African American literature will cite other authors whom they would have liked to have seen included. And perhaps others will find the collection as it is simply too big (more than 2600 pages!) and overwhelming. But all things considered, this anthology is a truly impressive achievement. It is an outstanding resource for teachers, students, and general readers.or and expertise in African American literature will cite other authors whom they would have liked to have seen included.

But when Ramirez is on target, his satirical power is stunning. &quot;Saint Nikolaus,&quot; for example, is a  savagely funny cross-cultural tale that takes place in Germany. And Ramirez' gentler side also shines in this book. The final selection is a father-son baseball story that I found very moving.<br />Readers who enjoy Ramirez' fiction might be interested in &quot;The Jaguar Smile,&quot; a collection of essays in which Salman Rushdie recounts his travels in Nicaragua in 1986. Rushdie recalls meeting Ramirez, who at that time was serving as Vice-President of Nicaragua, and discussing literature and politics with Ramirez and other Nicaraguan authors. My own reading of that book really enriched my appreciation of Ramirez' own work.<br />Sergio Ramirez is one of the most important writers to emerge from Central America, and &quot;Stories&quot; is a memorable collection. I strongly recommend it.	2000-11-17

Whaling in the 1860's (Smithsonian Odyssey)	Books	2	1	6	N	N	Visually impressive, but morally questionable	&quot;Thar She Blows!&quot; tells the story of Emma, a contemporary girl visiting the Whaling Exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. While telling some friends a story about an ancestor of hers who was a harpooner on a whaling ship back in the 1840s, Emma is magically transported back in time and actually takes part in a whale hunt.<br />Pat Fridell's color illustrations effectively complement the text by Sue Kassirer. The book also contains a short but informative article on the history of American whaling, as well as a useful glossary.<br />The big problem with this book, however, is its failure to deal with the moral issues surrounding the whaling industry. Today we know that whales are highly intelligent, social creatures. Many species of whales were pushed to the edge of extinction by excessive human hunting.<br />But &quot;Thar She Blows&quot; shows not a trace of compassion for the whales being hunted and slaughtered by the book's heroine and her shipmates. The text includes a gruesome, but emotionally detached description of a dead whale's body being cut up (fortunately, there is no accompanying picture).<br />I suppose if you want to teach your children to be utterly indifferent to the suffering of non-human beings, this would be a good book for you. But for those of us who want to raise our children as compassionate and morally aware beings, this book is very troublesome... If your child reads &quot;Thar She Blows!&quot; for its educational value, be sure to discuss with her the ethical issues which this book so callously ignores.	2000-11-16

Although marketed as a children's book, this volume will also appeal to older admirers of the &quot;Good Gray Poet.&quot;<br />Levin has judiciously selected some of Whitman's most memorable poems, and thoughtfully gives definitions of potentially unfamiliar words (&quot;Pleiades,&quot; &quot;hieroglyphic,&quot; etc.) at the bottom of each page. A five page biography of Whitman at the start of the book is another useful touch. Many of Burke's full-color visuals are stunning, and stand on their own as admirable pieces of art. Particularly memorable are the illustrations which accompany Whitman's address to a locomotive and his compassionate description of a slave's body at auction. &quot;Walt Whitman: Poetry for Young People&quot; is a fine book to share with its target audience.	2000-11-16

Not knowing Pali, I cannot judge the linguistic accuracy of Mascaro's translation. But as a lover of both poetry and spiritual philosophy, I can say that this English text is a quiet masterpiece.<br />The text is divided up into 423 short verses, each of which represents a teaching of the Buddha. This is one of those marvelous books which one can open at any page and begin reading. Often poetic, often practical, but always intriguing, the Dhammapada invites the reader to return again and again. Through its verses we can hear the Buddha challenging us to look at life from a radically new perspective; we hear him encouraging us to break free from the psychological prisons which we too often help build ourselves.<br />Also fascinating is Juan Mascaro's substantial introduction, in which he discusses the life of the historical Buddha and puts his legacy in a broad context that is both multifaith and multicultural. Scholars of comparative religion will probably be as interested in Mascaro's introduction as they are in the actual translation of the Dhammapada.<br />In the Dhammapada, we read, &quot;Better than a thousand useless verses is one single verse that gives peace&quot; (verse 101). Juan Mascaro's version of the Dhammapada is certainly a beautiful work of literature. But it is also a profoundly moving spiritual classic. Whatever your religious inclination (or lack thereof), you just might find in this wonderful book some verses that do indeed bring you closer to inner peace.	2000-11-14

In addition to collecting all 135 of Crane's known surviving poems, editor Joseph Katz has written a substantial introduction which places Crane's poetic achievement in context.<br />Most of Crane's poems are written in a free verse using simple, yet quietly powerful language. His words are full of irony and paradox; his vision is sometimes sarcastic and often dark, yet frequently surprises with gentleness and compassion. Reading Crane, I get the sense of meeting an ancient sage on a barren, wind-swept plain. His poems often have an oddly scriptural flavor to them; these are verses that invite return and reflection.<br />Stephen Crane writes, &quot;I have a thousand tongues / And nine and ninety-nine lie.&quot; Nonetheless, in &quot;The Complete Poems of Stephen Crane&quot; the attentive reader will discover a reservoir of disturbing truth.	2000-11-12

A collection of hundreds of Larson's distinctive cartoons, this book will sometimes shock, sometimes mystify, but always amuse.<br />Larson's overall vision is a bizarre, yet oddly coherent blend of fantasy, science fiction, horror, theological speculation, anthropological/zoological observation, and cultural criticism, all distilled through the mind of a master parodist. His trademark technique--the anthropomorphization of the unexpected--is on abundant display in &quot;Gallery 4.&quot; Larson's is a world in which squirrels read newspapers, alien juvenile delinquents abuse human astronauts, tapeworms go on vacation, bowling pins hold cocktail parties, and buzzards give poetry readings.<br />Larson will take on the most taboo subject in order to get a laugh, and he usually succeeds--often brilliantly. Trichinosis, obesity, conjoined twins, suicide, political protest, Native American culture, cryogenics, suffocation, old age, serial killers--nothing is off limits in &quot;Gallery 4.&quot; Larson even makes fun of his own cartoon series.<br />Another of the pleasures of reading &quot;The Far Side Gallery 4&quot; is the fact that you never know who you'll run into next. Larson's deranged imagination captures a whole host of fictional and historical figures: Albert Einstein, Humpty Dumpty, Tito Puente, Dr. Jekyll, Stephen King, and many, many more. When the floating head of Zsa Zsa Gabor threatens the crew of the starship &quot;Enterprise,&quot; you know you're in Larson territory.<br />The short foreword by Robin Williams (he describes Larson's vision as &quot;a National Geographic special on Prozac&quot;) is an added bonus to this collection. For fans of &quot;The Far Side,&quot; this is an indispensable collection; for those who haven't yet sampled the insane genius of Gary Larson, this is a great introduction.	2000-11-12
2214178:US	51987970	RSIM5MO43F2TT	0967686563	86124043	The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ (Official Edition)	Books	3	144	203	N	N	. . . but is it great literature?	Since it was first published in 1830, the Book of Mormon has consistently been the center of controversy. The book makes two extraordinary claims: first, that it is an authentic ancient text that was recovered and translated in the early 1800s by Joseph Smith; and second, that both the writing of the original text and its translation by Smith into English were directly inspired by the God of the Judeo-Christian Bible. Thus the Book of Mormon claims to be both a reliable historical record of ancient American civilizations and a supplement to the Bible--a truly new testament for the modern era.<br />Consequently, most criticism of the Book of Mormon has focused on these two interconnected claims. Is this book an authentic divine revelation? True believers have, over the last 170 years, united themselves to the Latter-day Saint religious movement. Disbelievers have condemned the book as either an audacious fraud or a demonic deception. The invective over the book has often grown quite personal, particularly between the main body of Latter-day Saints (also known as Mormons) and evangelical Protestants who view Mormonism as a heretical &quot;cult.&quot;<br />In all the fuss and furor over the Book of Mormon, however, few people seem to take a truly honest view of it as literature. Whether one views it as a divine revelation written by ancient prophets or as a work of fiction by a 19th century American, I think that all can agree that the Book of Mormon is a work of literature which bears the marks of purposeful construction on the part of any human who had a hand in its creation. Even the belief that the author (or authors) was a prophet does not erase the possibility of human creative agency. After all, a divine being may inspire an author, but that inspiration must be channeled through that author's abilities as a textual craftsperson.<br />And so the question thus arises: Apart from the Book of Mormon's value as a spiritual guide (or, if you prefer, danger as a spiritual counterfeit), is it a great work of literature? And where does it fit in the vast library of human literature? Personally, I think it's a pretty good yarn with some fascinating touches in the areas of form and style. And with regard to its place in world literature, I place it among the great body of works which consciously respond to, rewrite, or affirm the Judeo-Christian Bible: the Qur'an, John Milton's &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot; many of the poems of William Blake, other &quot;American Bibles&quot; like Mary Baker Eddy's &quot;Science and Health,&quot; novels like Zora Neale Hurston's &quot;Moses, Man of the Mountain,&quot; biblically-inspired horror films like &quot;The Omen,&quot; and many other texts.<br />As I said, I found the Book of Mormon to be quite compelling as a story. It is truly a narrative with an epic vision: it tells the story of two great migrations from the Old World to the Americas, and of the great civilizations that rose and fell from the seeds thus planted. The overall narrative spans many centuries of war, political intrigue, and cultural clashes. It is a vast tapestry whose scope calls to mind the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga or similar multigenerational science fiction epics.<br />Within this greater narrative are embedded many gems of localized storytelling and poetic imagery. Check out, for example, Lehi's vision of the tree of life (1 Nephi 8), the parable of the seed (Alma 32), or the story of the Jaredite ocean voyage (Ether 6). That last story contains a marvelous description of ancient submarine-like vessels being lit by a strange phosphorescent element.<br />The construction of the Book of Mormon should excite literary scholars interested in theories about narrative. The text has multiple narrators, some of whom comment on the other narrators. Furthermore, the book's progression moves back and forth chronologically (yet another similarity to some of my favorite science fiction sagas).<br />Of course, the Book of Mormon has itsdrawbacks. While the overwhelming focus on the person of Jesus Christ makes the book priceless to the Mormon faithful, this element presents a stumbling block to the faithful of other &quot;Abrahamic&quot; religions which clash with Mormonism. And secular readers will probably find the book's Christocentricity tiresome and preachy. The book's relative lack of strong female characters has been a point of criticism. Some of the book's racial and ethnic themes (see, for example, 2 Nephi 5) are disturbing. And many will find some of the narrative voices' direct addresses to the reader to sound like spiritual blackmail of the &quot;believe me or you'll be sorry&quot; variety.<br />Moreover, this edition of the Book of Mormon is explicitly geared towards the faithful of the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (and potential converts). It is thus not really an appropriate edition of the Book of Mormon for a pluralistic context (such as a literature course in a public university).<br />These concerns aside, I believe the Book of Mormon to be an important and fascinating work of American literature--a true hidden classic. I found it interesting that one of the great American plays of the 1990s, Tony Kushner's two-part epic &quot;Angels in America,&quot; draws deeply from the Book of Mormon with regard to the play's themes, plot, and characters. If an artist of Kushner's stature can give the Book of Mormon such serious consideration, perhaps it is time for the Book of Mormon to enjoy a wider audience that can finally appreciate and discuss the text as a work of literature, and not merely as a lightning rod for sectarian controversy.drawbacks.

A novelist, poet, songwriter, diplomat, educator, and activist, he left behind a towering legacy when he died in 1938. An essential part of that legacy is &quot;God's Trombones,&quot; a book in which Johnson pays poetic tribute to the &quot;old-time Negro preacher.&quot;<br />&quot;God's Trombones&quot; contains seven poems, each of which is inspired by the art of the classic African-American sermon. Most of Johnson's poems retell Bible stories. &quot;The Creation,&quot; &quot;Noah Built the Ark,&quot; &quot;Let My People Go,&quot; and more--each one carries the reader to the traditional Black churches of Johnson's era. In his preface Johnson discusses the cultural significance of the traditional African-American religious orator and also reflects on his own literary strategies in the construction of these poems.<br />Johnson's poems beg to be read aloud. Whatever your own ethnic heritage or religious inclination, try giving voice to these masterworks: you'll be amazed at the effect. If you are a lover of Christian inspirational writing, a scholar of African-American culture, or a person who appreciates great poetry, &quot;God's Trombones&quot; would make a fine addition to your library.	2000-11-11

Nicolas Guillen has constructed his book length poem of prose fragments, smaller self-contained poems, and other textual forms. The result is a dazzling collage which deconstructs the political, racial, and linguistic anxieties of 20th century Cuba.<br />This bilingual edition has Guillen's Spanish original on each odd-numbered page, with translator Vera Kutzinski's English version on each even-numbered page. Kutzinski has also written an outstanding introduction which contains insights into Guillen's life and art.<br />Guillen is a master of wordplay, &quot;special effects,&quot; and cultural critique. Whether he is capturing the effect of a blinking restaurant sign, creating imaginary newspaper advertisements, or peppering his verses with sarcastic footnotes, he shows that he is a wizard of the word. And he has serious things to say about racism, Cuban-U.S. relations, consumerism, and other controversial topics. &quot;The Daily Daily&quot; is an important work which should be read by scholars of Latin American literature, by fans of experimental writing, and by those interested in Cuban history and culture.	2000-11-11

For all its strengths, however, this book is a one-sided sectarian view whose main purpose seems to be to serve as a proselytizing tool for the Baha'i community; general readers should, therefore, read the book with an open but critical mind.<br />The book covers many areas. Its opening chapters relate the early history of the Baha'i faith, and introduce the reader to such important figures as the Bab, the forerunner of Baha'u'llah; Baha'u'llah himself, regarded as a holy prophet; and 'Abdul-Baha, the successor of Baha'u'llah. Later chapters further describe the new religion's theology, scriptures, and unique calendar. Excerpts from the Baha'i scriptures are effectively used throughout the book to accentuate the teachings of the faith.<br />Because this is a sectarian work, written with an eye towards promoting the Baha'i faith, the book lacks a critical dimension. Sharp-minded readers will have to come up with their own challenging questions and observations about the Baha'i faith. I, for example, was intrigued by the Baha'i faith's acknowledgment of Krishna, Moses, Zoroaster, Jesus, and Muhammad as prophets who share an essential unity with Baha'u'llah. So I wonder--where do the Sikh gurus fit in? Or the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith? Or Indian gurus like Krishnamurti? Or the Native American shamans whose oral traditions have been passed down and preserved? Or contemporary &quot;New Age&quot; spiritual leaders? The Baha'i Faith's teachings about the unity of world religions have ramifications which this book fails to fully explore.<br />Despite this uncritical, idealized portrayal of its subject, &quot;Baha'u'llah and the New Era&quot; is still a valuable book. For scholars of comparative religion, it is essential reading.ading.	2000-11-11

Every so often a new work comes around that truly represents a new high point in the field. Such a work is &quot;Kurt Busiek's Astro City: Life in the Big City,&quot; an intelligently written and spectacularly illustrated volume that tells the story of a remarkable group of superheroes.<br />&quot;Life&quot; is actually a collection of six interrelated stories, each of which stands on its own as a fine piece of comic book art. Together the six tales present a stunning portrait of the fictional Astro City, a postmodern metropolis teeming with costumed superheroes, sinister supervillains and other memorable characters. Among the many heroes we meet are Samaritan, the almost godlike caped hero with a tragic past; Winged Victory, a flying superwoman with a feminist twist; the Hanged Man, a mysterious figure who maintains a silent protective vigil; and Jack-in-the-Box, a demonic-looking clown with a number of high-tech tricks up his sleeve.<br />But just as compelling are the &quot;ordinary&quot; citizens of Astro City: veteran reporter Elliot Mills, legal clerk Marta, and the other working folks whose lives are lived in the shadow of the supermen.<br />&quot;Life in the Big City&quot; smoothly blends elements of science fiction, fantasy, horror, and social commentary. Well-written dialogue is complemented by a wealth of memorable images... The stories explore such thought-provoking issues as ethnic identity and the anxiety of assimilation, gender politics, and the psychology of paranoia. One of the compilation's best tales, &quot;The Scoop,&quot; is a witty and surprising parable about journalistic ethics.<br />The book length comic, or graphic novel, is a rich genre whose practitioners have produced some outstanding classics in recent years.

Together, they offer fascinating glimpses into a remarkable era in the history of the Americas.<br />Translators Magnus Magnusson and Hermann Palsson have also produced a thorough 37-page introduction which discusses the archeological evidence for the medieval Norse presence in the Americas, the historical development of the sagas themselves, and the evolution of the saga as a unique genre of literature. Maps, a chronology, and other resources further enhance this book's usefulness for students and teachers.<br />But don't let the scholarly apparatus fool you into thinking that &quot;The Vinland Sagas&quot; is just a text for the classroom. The sagas themselves, likely written in the 12th and 13th centuries, are still great reading all these hundreds of years later. With their simple, no-nonsense prose style, along with the presence of characters with such names as &quot;Thorhall the Hunter&quot; and &quot;Aud the Deep-Minded,&quot; the sagas have a truly unique quality.<br />And for those interested in the history of the Americas or in multicultural issues, these two sagas contain a wealth of tantalizing episodes and characters. Each tale reflects the conflict between Christianity and Paganism within Norse culture during that great age of exploration. Also fascinating are the accounts of the first encounters between the Norsemen and the &quot;skraelings&quot; (the Norse word for the indigenous inhabitants of this new world). Also noteworthy is each saga's colorful portrayal of the Norse women; both feminist scholars and general readers should be intrigued by these bold foremothers.<br />The &quot;first contact&quot; tale has long been a mainstay of classic science fiction in book, television, and motion picture form. Think of &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still,&quot; &quot;E.T.&quot; and other narratives that depict an imaginary initial encounter between human beings and alien cultures. The stories contained in &quot;The Vinland Sagas&quot; represent the great medieval precursors of such science fiction classics; even more remarkably, these Icelandic sagas are grounded in real history.

But this introduction to the &quot;modern&quot; style of architecture is not just a book for historians: it is visually stunning achievement that will be appreciated by all who have a passion for the art and science of home architecture.<br />The book introduces the reader to 62 marvelous houses which exemplify the modern style. Architects represented include Gregory Ain, George Howe, Richard J. Neustra, Raphael S. Soriano, and many more. Detailed floor plans, exterior and interior photographs, and details of construction are included. The houses range in size from modest 1- or 2-bedroom homes to expansive, luxurious mansions.<br />This book is a spectacular introduction to the vocabulary of the modern period in architecture. The photographs and floor plans capture the bold interplay of geometric shapes, the experimentation with glass and other materials, the profusion of balconies and terraces, and above all, the concern with functionality that motivated the masters of the modern.<br />Co-authors James Ford and Katherine Morrow Ford have included a interesting introduction. Also included is a collection of brief statements by many of the featured architects.<br />This is a great book for those interested in American cultural history, interior design, home photography, and other subjects. But at its core this book is an excellent record of and tribute to one of the most remarkable movements in the history of home architecture.	2000-11-09

This book is a gloriously detailed guide to the series' first eight seasons.<br />Each individual episode gets a full page (in some cases, two pages) which contains a plot summary, full-color scenes, memorable lines of dialogue, writing/directing credits and other appetizing tidbits. The book's many supplemental sections include a complete &quot;Itchy and Scratchy&quot; filmography, a collection of Krusty the Clown merchandise, and a guide to the original Simpsons short films.<br />As ambitious and successful as this book is, there are some omissions. I would have liked to have seen photos and short bios of each of the main cast members who bring these characters to life. Some perspective on the show's impact upon pop culture would also have been welcome.<br />These criticisms aside, this is a wonderfully funny and informative book. From the secret ingredient in the &quot;Flaming Moe&quot; to the lyrics of &quot;The Stonecutters' Song,&quot; this book is packed with delights and surprises. If you are a casual &quot;Simpsons&quot; fan, this book may turn you into an obsessed fanatic; if you are already such a fanatic, you will be in heaven.	2000-11-08

Lovecraft possessed a truly unique voice and vision. There is perhaps no better example of his art than &quot;At the Mountains of Madness,&quot; the superb short novel which is accompanied by three shorter tales in this volume.<br />The story of an antarctic expedition whose members uncover a shocking ancient mystery, &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; incorporates many of Lovecraft's trademark themes and techniques. The short novel blends elements of mystery, science fiction, and horror with a subtle satire of academia.  Lovers of literature will appreciate Lovecraft's references to Edgar Allan Poe.<br />&quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; is also a gripping adventure story, as we follow the narrator into a forgotten world of monstrous landscapes and equally monstrous creatures. Lovecraft's unique prose style--at once elegantly learned and primally disturbing--contributes greatly to the narrative. There has never been a writer quite like Lovecraft, and this brilliant short novel remains one of his best works.	2000-11-08

The two speakers were Peter Vandall and Joe Douquette, elders of the Cree Indian people. &quot;Stories of the House People&quot; is a record of these two men, their community, and their language.<br />Vandall and Douquette, who took turns speaking, delivered their oration in the Cree language. The book contains three versions of the complete text. The first version is written in the Cree language using the distinctive Cree writing system--a syllabary composed of almost mathematical-looking characters. The second version has the Cree language transliterated into the Roman alphabet, and the third version is editor Freda Ahenakew's translation into English. The book also contains an informative introduction, a Cree-English glossary, and several other scholarly aids.<br />I was greatly intrigued the first time I encountered this wonderful book. It is a glimpse into the language and culture of an ethnic group which has survived centuries of encroachment by &quot;Europeanizing&quot; forces on the North American continent. Moreover, the presentation of texts in the Cree syllabary adds a stunning visual element to the book's overall cultural significance.<br />This book is a moving tribute to two community elders who retain both a fierce pride in their heritage and a desire to preserve that heritage. The men both share their own opinions and recall stories which they had heard previously via oral transmission. A colorful tale of a dance contest, a gory trapper's story, and a meditation on that quality known as &quot;Creeness&quot; are some of the orations shared by the pair.<br />This book offers rewarding reading for those interested in Native American studies. And it will also interest those, regardless of cultural heritage, who are interested in preserving the oral traditions of their own community. Perhaps &quot;Stories of the House People&quot; will inspire some young people to take an audiotape recorder or video recorder and preserve the wit and wisdom of their own tribal elders.the House People&quot; will inspire some young people to take an audiotape recorder or video recorder and preserve the wit and wisdom of their own tribal elders.	2000-11-08

If I were the Devil, I would not waste my energy against an opponent whose best weapon is a sloppy mess like this book.<br />Throughout &quot;In the Name of Satan,&quot; Larson refers to Satanic atrocities and conspiracies, but fails to produce a shred of documentation. One of his more ridiculous claims involves being impersonated by demons. Another relates a close encounter with Satan's horse. Reading his rantings I was reminded of the notorious Senator Joe McCarthy, whose witch hunt for suspected Communists ruined many lives. We can be thankful that Bob Larson does not hold a senate seat, and has to use the writing of laughable books as the outlet for his obsession.<br />The self-portrait that Bob Larson creates in this book is far more disturbing than the description of any demon. In chapter 12, for example, he describes how he burned a Balinese wooden carving because he believed a demon was &quot;drawing strength from it.&quot; I wonder--could book burning be Larson's next strategy?<br />The overall air of obsessive self-love gives the book an unintentionally humorous quality. Towards the end of the book, for example, he includes an anonymous (first name only) letter from a girl who writes, &quot;Bob Larson is the most special person in the world.&quot; I get the sense that Larson really believes that line!<br />Larson's book is a good documentary example of a certain breed of Christianity: this particular belief system seems to be more fixated on Satan than on Jesus. Perhaps it would be more accurate to refer to Larson's religious tradition as &quot;Satanophobism&quot; rather than Christianity.<br />This is a book which lacks credibility. It will appeal to naive individuals with low self esteem who want to imagine themselves as courageous soldiers in Larson's anti-Satanic army. For the rest of us, it provides an interesting, if ineptly written, glimpse into the psychology of contemporary religious fanaticism.self esteem who want to imagine themselves as courageous soldiers in Larson's anti-Satanic army.

In this book the full text of Martin Luther King's famous speech is accompanied by 14 superb works, most of them in full color, by 15 different artists.<br />The book contains a thoughtful forward by Coretta Scott King and a brief but informative biographical supplement about Dr. King himself. A magnificent black-and-white photographic portrait of Dr. King in his oratorical mode serves as an effective complement to the rest of the book's illustrations. Also noteworthy are the final pages of the book, in which the artists briefly share their personal thoughts about Dr. King's legacy and about their contributions to the book.<br />The power of Dr. King's speech is greatly enhanced by the beautiful artwork of this book. The pictures encompass many different artistic styles and techniques. Each one is a masterpiece which invites the reader to return and reflect upon it.<br />As I noted at the start of the interview, this book should be enjoyed by both adults and children. It would make a wonderful gift for individuals interested in the civil rights movement, in African-American history, in multiculturalism and racial reconciliation, or in contemporary art. This book is a fitting tribute to one of the 20th century's most influential visionaries.	2000-11-07

Written in simple language and enriched throughout with excellent full-color photographs, this book should appeal both to beginning readers and to children who still need to have books read aloud to them.<br />Powell covers many important topics. She explains different types of physical disabilities, explains the need for wheelchair-accessible public accommodations, discusses guide dogs and other aids, and discusses sporting activities in a disabled context. Throughout the book the outstanding photography depicts disabled people as dynamic, positive individuals who are an important part of the general population. Also commendable is the fact that disabled people of many different ages and races are pictured.<br />The book has only a couple of minor drawbacks. Powell's prose, while very positive and considerate, speaks about the disabled without actually letting any disabled individual's voice be heard. I would have liked to have seen a quote or two from an actual disabled individual incorporated into the text. Also, although the notes for parents and teachers at the end of the book mention such disabled role models as Helen Keller and Christy Brown, such well-known individuals are neither mentioned nor pictured in the main body of the text.<br />These drawbacks aside, &quot;Talking about Disability&quot; is an intelligent and sensitive introduction to an important issue. I recommend this book with enthusiasm.	2000-11-07

The plays include &quot;The Contrast,&quot; Royall Tyler's satire of financial and sexual politics; &quot;The Indian Princess,&quot; James Nelson Barker's musical retelling of the legend of Pocahontas; &quot;The Gladiator,&quot; Robert Montgomery Bird's tragedy of slavery in ancient Rome; &quot;Fashion,&quot; Anna Cora Mowatt's witty comedy about life in New York; and four other gems.<br />Richards has not only written an insightful introduction for the entire anthology, but provides informative separate introductions to each play. He shares relevant details about each author's life and about the cultural context in which the play was written and performed. Extensive bibliographic material further adds to this book's value as a scholarly resource.<br />Richards has also made an excellent selection of plays. These literary works brilliantly illuminate the social, political, and cultural issues which impacted the United States from the late 18th to mid 19th centuries. As the editor says in his introduction to the collection, these texts &quot;will still reward the careful reader.&quot;  Whether one is interested in images of the Native American, substance abuse, racial anxieties, gender politics, or abolitionist thought, one will find plenty of relevant material in &quot;Early American Drama.&quot;<br />I used this book as a class text when I taught a course in early American literature at the University of Pittsburgh some time ago. Some of our best class sessions were spent with the students assuming roles in scenes from these plays and performing these scenes. It was marvelous to hear these classic texts come to life. These are not just texts to be studied by scholars; these plays are a vibrant part of the cultural heritage of the United States. Read, critique, learn, and enjoy.	2000-11-06

This book invites the reader to explore dozens of magnificent houses that represent the Royal Barry Wills philosophy. Detailed floor plans are complemented with a wealth of exterior and interior photographs.<br />Every page of this book is a visual feast. The homes presented represent a dazzling diversity of configurations, but each one bears the Wills trademark of elegant harmony and functionality. The appealing black-and-white photographs record numerous memorable details. We see the turned balusters of a wooden staircase, a multi-paned bow window, a charming cobblestone courtyard--I could go on and on. If you love classic American home architecture, you will want to add this beautiful book to your shelves.	2000-11-05

Co-authors Frank Foster and Lawrence Borts have an obvious love and respect for their subject, and this commitment shows on every one of the book's pages.<br />This is as complete a guide to U.S. military ribbons and medals as I could imagine. The authors describe the history and criteria of each award and provide clear full-color photographs of each one. The book also contains detailed information about the various devices worn on each ribbon, guides to the proper wear of medals and ribbons on the uniform, and much more. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marine awards are all covered. There is even a special section on United Nations mission medals.<br />This book would make a great gift for veterans, currently serving military personnel, and amateur military historians. The many illustrations make this book a truly beautiful reference work. But more than that, this book is a meaningful tribute to the women and men who have actually earned these medals and ribbons over the years. As a veteran myself, I want to thank and congratulate Frank Foster and Lawrence Borts for a stunning achievement. I look forward to the sixth edition.	2000-11-05

Krishnamurti reflects that goal of education should be to help students develop into truly &quot;integrated&quot; human beings, and not merely to turn them into well-trained automatons.<br />Along the way, Krishnamurti offers pointed and thought-provoking critiques of such institutions as organized religion, national identity, and the family. And throughout the book he stresses one of his core themes: a resistance to conformity and mindless obedience.<br />Krishnamurti has been called a modern-day Buddha, and this book is a rich source of aphoristic statements that radiate with insight. On religion: &quot;Organized religion is the frozen thought of man....&quot;  On national identity: &quot;Nationalism is a disease, and it can never bring about world unity.&quot; On morality: &quot;Organized religions are much concerned about our sexual morality; but they allow us to perpetuate violence and murder in the name of patriotism, to indulge in envy and crafty ruthlessness, and to pursue power and success.&quot;<br />For both professional educators and general readers, &quot;Education and the Significance of Life&quot; is a challenging work of spiritual and philosophical writing.	2000-11-05

My immediate thoughts were two: incredulity that I had never encountered this masterpiece before, and an overwhelming desire to share it with as many people as I could.<br />Such is the power of this book. The poem, inspired by the great Chilean poet's visit to the ancient, abandoned city of Macchu Picchu, is presented in a bilingual format; Neruda's Spanish original faces Tarn's English on each two-page spread.<br />&quot;The Heights of Macchu Picchu&quot; contains lines of poetic language that are both beautiful and thought-provoking. But equally intrinsic to this great work is the author's compassion for the human condition--a compassion which transcends the boundaries of time and culture. Neruda's passionate addresses to the men and women who shed their blood and their tears in the construction of this ancient stone city nearly had me in tears myself.<br />This is one of those remarkable poems which is pregnant with the fire of prophecy; it reads like a sacred text for the modern age. Neruda's miniature epic is, I believe, one of those works which will abide as a monument of global literature. It is a gift for the entire human family.	2000-11-05

The concept of the book is simple: the narrator introduces young Conrad Cornelius o'Donald o'Dell to the weird and wonderful letters that come after &quot;z&quot; (yes, AFTER &quot;z&quot;), and provides the wide-eyed child with a marvelous bestiary of the Seussian creatures whose names begin with these letters.<br />Actually, Seuss's post-&quot;z&quot; letters appear to constitute a syllabary rather than a true extended alphabet, but why quibble over technical details? The letters/syllabics and their accompanying creatures represent Seuss at his most delightful. And best of all, he leaves the door open for readers to create their own extension to the alphabet/syllabary!<br />More than mere whimsy, &quot;On Beyond Zebra&quot; is a truly mind-expanding book. Through fantasy and humor, Seuss challenges us to open our minds to new possibilities; he encourages us to tear down artificial walls that restrict our intellectual and creative growth. This book would be as useful in teaching pedagogical theory to college students as it is for entertaining children. &quot;On Beyond Zebra&quot; is a triumph.	2000-11-03

Whether or not you've had such an experience, Akira Nakanishi's &quot;Writing Systems of the World&quot; will open your eyes to the glorious diversity of its title subject.<br />Nakanishi's excellent reference work organizes the writing systems geographically. Each of the major writing systems is carefully profiled, and the phonetic equivalents (in Roman characters) are given for all syllabic and alphabetic characters.<br />The book dramatically illustrates the major writing systems by reproducing pages from newspapers throughout the world. It is marvelous to see the Armenian alphabet, the Amharic syllabary, and many other writings systems thus used in the context of practical daily communication.<br />In addition to the thorough profiles of nearly 30 major systems, Nakanishi gives shorter examples of dozens more writing systems, ranging from those used with extinct ancient languages to new writing systems invented in modern times. The book also contains appendices which explain the classification system for writing systems (ideographic versus phonetic, phonemic versus syllabic, etc.) and the variations in directions in which scripts are written. A glossary, a bibliography, and an index all add to the book's usefulness.<br />Not only is this book informative, but it is also a visual feast which offers delights and surprises on every page. This is a reference work to be savored.	2000-11-03

He vividly describes his experiences as a soldier in Europe during World War II. Particularly harrowing are his memories of slave labor in a German prisoner-of-war camp. We also learn of his academic study of the work of French philosopher Maurice Blondel, his ordination to the Roman Catholic priesthood, and his awakening to the world of gay love and sex.<br />Particularly important are the chapters describing the aftermath of the publication of &quot;The Church and the Homosexual.&quot; McNeill was eventually expelled from the Jesuit order. He also writes of his relationships with a number of gay Christian groups and leaders, and pays warm tribute to his lover, Charles Chiarelli.<br />McNeill's writing style is full of insight and compassion. He is also a delightfully learned and literate writer--the book is spiced with references to and quotes from James Joyce, Kurt Vonnegut, Viktor Frankl, the Roman poet Virgil, and many other authors.<br />The book's annotated bibliography to the works of its author makes it a valuable reference to scholars.<br />The people quoted on the book's back cover blurbs describe McNeill as a &quot;gay saint&quot; and a &quot;prophet,&quot; and &quot;Both Feet. . .&quot; lives up to these tributes. It is a stirring spiritual autobiography that resounds with moral authority and intellectual depth. McNeill's life story is a convincing testament to the possibility of integrating gay love and sexuality into a committed Christian life.	2000-11-03

Editor Roberto Santiago has assembled a collection of writings which illuminate the joys, sorrows, and complexities of the Puerto Rican experience.<br />This anthology has many strengths. It contains a full range of genres--poetry, speeches, short fiction, essays, drama, and more. There is even a transcription of one of Freddie Prinze's classic comedy routines. There is also a good mix of male and female authors: Julia de Burgos, Piri Thomas, Aurora Levins Morales, Jesus Colon, and many, many more.<br />The book does have some flaws. The author biographies at the end of the book are far too short and insubstantial--many of them are only 2 or 3 lines long. More bibliographic data on each author would have made the book a more powerful resource for teachers and students. And the book could have used a firmer editorial hand in parts. The excerpt from Miguel Pinero's play &quot;Short Eyes,&quot; for example, contains no editorial indication that this is in fact an excerpt; readers might be misled to believe that this is a short one-act play in its entirety.<br />Another drawback to the anthology is the relative lack of writers from the 19th century and earlier. With the exception of Jose de Diego, these pioneers of Puerto Rican literature are entirely absent. If you want to read the important poetry and prose of Manuel A. Alonso, Jose Gautier Benitez, Pachin Marin, and others, you will have to look elsewhere.<br />These criticisms aside, &quot;Boricuas&quot; is an excellent collection. The stories, poems, and other selections are full of all the richness of the Puerto Rican experience. Some of the best selections include Migene Gonzalez-Wippler's autobiographical piece about her experience of the Santeria religion, Abraham Rodriguez' multilayered short story &quot;The Boy Without a Flag,&quot; and editor Santiago's excellent introductory essay.<br />This wonderful book makes an excellent class text for high school or college courses; in fact, I used it when I taught the &quot;Literature of the Americas&quot; course offered by the University of Pittsburgh. But this is also a book for outside the classroom; it is a collection to be read, enjoyed, and shared with loved ones. &quot;Boricuas&quot; is a triumph for both Roberto Santiago and for the many authors whose voices are celebrated between the book's covers.uctory essay.<br />This wonderful book makes an excellent class text for high school or college courses; in fact, I used it when I taught the &quot;Literature of the Americas&quot; course offered by the University of Pittsburgh.

A former Dutch colony, Suriname has a population consisting of several distinct cultural groups. One of the most remarkable aspects of Surinamese life is Sranan Tongo, the creole language which is unique to this country.<br />In &quot;Creole Drum,&quot; editors Jan Voorhoeve and Ursy M. Lichtveld have assembled a marvelous anthology of Sranan Tongo texts. The book's useful bilingual format has the original Sranan Tongo on each even-numbered page, with Vernie A. February's English translation on the facing page.<br />This is more than just an anthology; the book is a richly informative introduction to Surinamese history and to the Sranan Tongo language. The explanatory essays and appendices, together with a useful bibliography and index, make this book an outstanding reference work.<br />But the heart of &quot;Creole Drum&quot; is the collected and translated literature. Included are traditional folksongs and folktales, a selection of prose writings of 19th century author Johannes King, selections from the Surinamese periodical &quot;Foetoe-boi,&quot; examples of Surinamese poetry of the 1960s and 70s, and more.<br />Some of my favorite selections from &quot;Creole Drum&quot; were the poems of Johanna Schouten-Elsenhout, whose startling visions dramatize the conflict between Pagan and Christian religious practices in Suriname.<br />This book is a valuable contribution not only to Suriname studies, but also to the overlapping field of Creole language studies. Pidgin and creole languages are a worldwide phenomenon, and the editors of &quot;Creole Drum&quot; brilliantly illuminate the distinctive creole language of Suriname.<br />This is a thought-provoking book which will inspire readers to explore questions about race, religion, national identity, ethnicity, and language politics. But more than that, it contains some startlingly powerful and beautiful literature which should be enjoyed as much as studied. The Surinamese poet Henny F. de Ziel, who uses the pseudonym &quot;Trefossa,&quot; wrote &quot;A true poem is another land. . . / A true poem is made of words that linger on.&quot; &quot;Creole Drum&quot; will take you to another land, and the best of its offerings will linger in your soul., it contains some startlingly powerful and beautiful literature which should be enjoyed as much as studied.

The book consists, very simply, of a series of rhetorical questions divided up among 74 untitled poems (each poem contains from 3 to 6 questions). In this bilingual volume, Pablo Neruda's Spanish text is accompanied on each page by William O'Daly's crisp English translation.<br />Neruda asks questions about a dizzying range of topics--the natural world, religion, literature, history, food, the technological world, language, time, truth, justice, perception, and even his own legacy. Some of his questions are funny, some are disturbing. But all are thought-provoking, and the best of them display Neruda's dazzling ability to use words in surprising and illuminating ways. Who but Neruda would ask, &quot;And at whom does rice smile / with infinitely many white teeth?&quot; (section XII).<br />Reading &quot;The Book of Questions,&quot; I had the sensation of reading some strange work of scripture--the writings of a prophet who had transcended the normal boundaries of perception and who challenges us to do the same. Although Neruda's prophetic voice varies greatly in mood--sometimes angry, sometimes playful, sometimes melancholy--his mastery of his poetic instrument is consistent, and the breadth of his vision is amazing. He is one of those poets--like William Blake, Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson--whose writings constitute a modern equivalent to the poetic legacy of Buddha, Lao-Tzu, or the author of Ecclesiastes.<br />It's impossible to pick out just a few questions with which to give the reader a full sense of the power of &quot;the Book of Questions.&quot; This is a book which one can read at one breathless sitting; it is also a book that, like an inscrutable sage, invites us to return again and again. Neruda muses, &quot;What did the tree learn from the earth / to be able to talk with the sky?&quot; (section XLI); his words strike me as a text which, like that rich, primal earth, could also be a source of wisdom.<br />In section X, Neruda asks, &quot;What will they say about my poetry / who never touched my blood?&quot; I believe that those who read and ponder &quot;The Book of Questions&quot; will say that the poetry of Pablo Neruda is one of the great treasures of world literature.could also be a source of wisdom.<br />In section X, Neruda asks, &quot;What will they say about my poetry / who never touched my blood?&quot; I believe that those who read and ponder &quot;The Book of Questions&quot; will say that the poetry of Pablo Neruda is one of the great treasures of world literature.	2000-11-02

Nor can it be denied that the book is a useful resource. But on the whole, I found myself disappointed by the book. Too often the editors and the contributors take the road of least resistance, and ultimately the book fails to attain its full potential.<br />There is a lot to admire in this volume, which was produced under the banner of the Congress of National Black Churches (CNBC). Interwoven throughout the text of the King James Version of the Judeo-Christian Bible are over 300 short meditations, each one written by a member (primarily ordained clergy) of one of the CNBC's member denominations. These denominations include the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the National Baptist Convention of America, and several others. A useful introduction includes brief histories of each denomination, and short (2 or 3 line) minibiographies of each author appear at the end of the book.<br />Many of the meditations are both inspiring and relevant to the study of African-American culture. Some of the more striking selections include Joseph C. Coles' reflection on Esther 4:14, which recounts an encounter between Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglass. Another notable selection is Nehemiah Mitchum's meditation on Proverbs 22:1, which includes a quote from Shakespeare's &quot;Othello.&quot;<br />Unfortunately, such meaty selections are too few and far between.  Too many of the meditations in &quot;The African-American Devotional Bible&quot; are vague and insubstantial platitudes. These meditations trot out cliche after cliche, and offer no new or challenging insights.<br />Even worse is the book's failure to effectively deal with some of the more painful and controversial issues facing the African-American church. I suppose that it could be argued that a devotional Bible is not the appropriate vehicle for dealing with controversy. But I ask: If Christians cannot confront potentially painful and divisive issues during their devotional reading of the Bible, when will they deal with those issues?<br />The book's &quot;Subject Index&quot; is indicative of the book's overall unevenness. There is only a single entry under AIDS--a disease that has been devastating to many African-American communities. And consider the title of the AIDS meditation: &quot;Loving the Sinner, Challenging the Sin.&quot; Why couldn't they have included a single positive, uplifting meditation for people with AIDS and their families which doesn't harp on the presumed sins of the person with AIDS? And on that note, I have always thought that many Christian preachers employ a dishonest double-standard when they talk about AIDS. Why is &quot;sin&quot; rarely mentioned with regard to those Christians who spend a lifetime indulging in a high-fat, high-salt diet before succumbing to heart disease? (although, to be fair, the author of the AIDS meditation does mention that some acts can render us susceptible to &quot;other diseases&quot; besides AIDS.)<br />The &quot;Subject Index&quot; includes only a single entry on women. And it contains NO entries on the following topics: addiction/substance abuse, abortion/abortion rights, anti-Semitism, domestic violence, homophobia/homosexuality, interfaith relations, poverty, or war. But there are twelve (!) entries on &quot;obedience&quot;--what, I wonder, is the agenda being pushed by the clergy who wrote these entries? For Christians grappling with the truly challenging issues facing the African-American church, this devotional Bible is not terribly insightful.<br />Yes, there is much to admire in &quot;The African-American Devotional Bible.&quot; But it is a sadly limited resource which, I fear, will be used to foster intellectual and spiritual laziness among its readership.ns cannot confront potentially painful and divisive issues during their devotional reading of the Bible, when will they deal with those issues?<br />The book's &quot;Subject Index&quot; is indicative of the book's overall unevenness.

A nun who lived in seventeenth century Mexico, she distinguished herself as a poet, playwright, and prose writer.<br />&quot;Poems, Protest, and a Dream&quot; is an excellent introduction to the life and work of this fascinating woman. This selection of her works includes her famous prose piece addressed to &quot;Sor Filotea de la Cruz,&quot; a hearty helping of her poetry, and two selections from her dramatic corpus. The bilingual format of the text, with Sor Juana's Spanish original on each even-numbered page and Margaret Sayers Peden's elegant English translation on each odd-numbered page, allows one to easily compare the two versions.<br />The distinguished scholar Ilan Stavans has written an extensive 32 page introduction. Stavans describes in detail the historical and cultural context from which Sor Juana wrote; his sensitive and intelligent portrait of the woman and her age made me appreciate and enjoy her writings even more.<br />Sor Juana takes on themes that are still relevant (and often hotly debated) more than three centuries after she wrote these works. The response to Sor Filotea is a defense of female intellectual aspiration in a male-dominated culture; in the defense Sor Juana critically responds to those who use the Judeo-Christian Bible as a tool for intimidating and marginalizing women. With certain factions of the &quot;religious right&quot; still using the Bible as a weapon for demonizing certain individuals and social agendas, Sor Juana's words continue to ring fresh and clear.<br />Equally extraordinary is Sor Juana's loa (a dramatic scene which prefaces a longer play) to &quot;The Divine Narcissus.&quot; The loa is an allegory depicting the early contact between Christianity and the religion of the Aztecs; in this piece I detect a subtle satirical thrust which adds to the complexity of Sor Juana's vision.<br />Sor Juana was a masterful stylist in multiple literary genres, and her depth of psychological and moral insight adds to her stature as a literary giant. Nobody should consider herself or himself literate in the fields of women's studies or Latin American studies without having read the works of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz. &quot;Poems, Protest, and a Dream&quot; is an excellent resource for both independent reading and classroom use.

Vargas Llosa accompanies each of the reproductions with a fictional interpretation that serves as a counterpoint to the primary narrative of the stepmother and her household. This device allows the author to take his reader across time and space, from fantasy to horror as the erotic odyssey unfolds.<br />In both the main narrative and the shorter embedded fictions, Vargas Llosa both shocks and seduces the reader with his sensuous detail and psychological insights. &quot;In Praise of the Stepmother&quot; is a multi-media tour-de-force. A delight for lovers of erotica, classic visual art, and great literature, this book confirms in my mind Mario Vargas Llosa's stature as one of the world's great writers.	2000-10-30

While the book has some strengths, I find that its drawbacks are much greater.<br />The bulk of the book is an explanation/defense of evangelical Christianity in poetic form. Each of the poem's 8 chapters focuses on a particular aspect of the faith: &quot;Jesus,&quot; &quot;Repentance,&quot; &quot;The Bible,&quot; etc.<br />Unfortunately, Everts' faith is a feel-good, self-congratulatory form of Christianity which is incapable of taking on the hard questions. At his worse, Everts strikes me as ethically irresponsible. At the very opening of the poem, for example, he casually dismisses &quot;everything from the Crusades to / the perpetually complex and powerful / Vatican machinery&quot; (13). I am sure that some readers will regard these lines as a bigoted anti-Catholic jab, but I am more concerned about his easy disposal of the Crusades, one of the most tragic and violent parts of the Christian legacy. Real human beings died as a result of Christian fanaticism during the Crusades; are these lives so easy to toss away in a single line?<br />Throughout the book, Everts encourages his evangelical readers to indulge in masturbatory fantasies of &quot;persecution&quot; and alienation. Of his type of Christian Everts writes, &quot;these Kingdom Dwellers. . . / they're illegal aliens, / foreign ambassadors, / a threat to national security&quot; (61). I doubt that many of the privileged campus Christians who will use this book to stroke their egos really know what it's like to suffer true persecution; unfortunately, Everts fosters shallow martyr fantasies over real introspection.<br />There are some good moments in &quot;Jesus with Dirt Feet.&quot; Everts' chapter on the Bible, for example, contains some genuinely insightful poetic language. But as in the rest of the book, Everts' message is compromised either by ignorance or moral cowardice. Why, I wanted to ask him, has the Bible been so potent a source of proof-texts for supporters of genocide, slavery, racial segregation, the disenfranchisement of women, anti-Semitism, anti-gay bigotry, and other evils throughout history?<br />Reading Everts' words I was reminded of the ninth chapter of the &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,&quot; which describes how a Christian slaveowner savagely tortures a disabled slave woman while quoting a Bible verse that appears to justify his actions. Everts' vacuous feel-good Christianity fails to address the seductiveness of Christian fanaticism, the problematic nature of many biblical passages, and the long list of victims of &quot;faithful Christians&quot; through the centuries.<br />Everts condemns the many versions of Jesus which have been popular in various circles: &quot;my grandparents' soft Jesus who blesses nice people who don't smoke or cuss, the liberationists' machine-gun toting Jesus, the atheists' papier-mache Jesus&quot; and others (7). But in his arrogance Everts substitutes yet another hollow (and potentially dangerous) cliche: the trendy &quot;coffeehouse Jesus.&quot;<br />People interested in a truly challenging and meaningful vision of Christianity would be better off reading the works of Thomas Merton, Carter Heyward, Martin Luther King, John McNeil, or some of the other Christians who have, like Jesus, challenged the status quo.

Reed's &quot;Victorian Dwellings for Village and Country&quot; is one of the best. A complete reproduction of the 1885 edition of this book, the Dover reprint is a fascinating and beautiful glimpse into one of home architecture's richest eras.<br />The plan of the book is simple and informative. It is a collection of 35 marvelously detailed designs for homes that range from a humble three-room cottage to an imposing boarding house. Each selection contains front and side (and in some cases, rear) elevations, along with floor plans for the first and (for the 2- and 3-story buildings) second stories. Each building is accompanied by a charming descriptive essay and a detailed estimate of the 1885 cost to build it.<br />The building plans bear such picturesque names as &quot;Lillie Lake,&quot; &quot;Willimantic,&quot; &quot;Ravenswood,&quot; and &quot;Stepping Stones.&quot; Interspersed among the design profiles are a few short essays on such relevant topics as plumbing and building cost estimation.<br />The Victorian language of the descriptive essays is a delight. Consider this description of the New Brighton (Design XV): &quot;It has a tasty and picturesque exterior, and is convenient, cosey [sic] and cheerful within.&quot; But even more delightful are the floor plans and elevations. Covered verandas, inglenooks, decorative trim, towers and balconies--the full extravagant vocabulary of Victorian architecture is gloriously preserved.<br />This book will be treasured by historians, old house restorationists, artists, students of architecture and many more.	2000-10-29

A collection of poems and essays, &quot;Dyke Hands&quot; covers a wide range of the author's diverse interests: spirituality, eroticism, cultural politics, love, and the struggles that come with being a writer.<br />The book is divided up into four sections: &quot;Spirituality,&quot; &quot;Race and Culture,&quot; &quot;Love, Joy, Sex, and Loss,&quot; and &quot;Selves and Selfhood.&quot; Each of the four sections begins with several poems and concludes with one of Bogus' characteristically witty and insightful essays. From a diversity of her own materials, Bogus has thus constructed a unified and satisfying whole.<br />Bogus' poems cover a broad range of themes and poetic styles. Some standouts include &quot;The Creator's Dalliance: Psalm 3,&quot; a playfully rhyming deconstruction of gendered concepts of deity; &quot;Michael Jackson,&quot; a painful meditation on the public image of the celebrated entertainer; and &quot;Making Whoopee,&quot; a highly erotic description of a lesbian sexual encounter with another Black woman.<br />Equally engaging are her four essays. The best of the quartet are strongly autobiographical. &quot;The First Temptation of an Arrogant Christian and a Fledgling Buddhist&quot; is a revealing memoir of the author's own spiritual journey, and of her quest to  integrate her lesbian sexuality into that journey. The final essay, &quot;To My Mother's Vision,&quot; is a stunning memoir of her birth as a poet during a fertile period of African-American cultural production in the 1960s and 70s. Containing Bogus' reflections on her encounters with such important African-American literary figures as Gwendolyn Brooks, Nikki Giovanni, and Dudley Randall, this final essay is a wonderful resource for students of Black literature.<br />&quot;Dyke Hands&quot; will be of particular interest to those interested in the art of poetry and of the essay, as well as to students of lesbian literature and African-American culture. SDiane Bogus writes, &quot;I personally advocate for the good, just, right, truthful, faithful, and an appreciation of the beautiful.&quot; With regard to that goal, &quot;Dyke Hands&quot; is a trumph.the art of poetry and of the essay, as well as to students of lesbian literature and African-American culture.

But Gomi's basic message is sound: relieving one's bowels is a normal part of our everyday lives. In a world where too many people are too embarrassed to ask their doctor about colorectal cancer and other &quot;poop&quot;-related health problems, Taro Gomi's book is especially valuable. If the child (or parent) who enjoys this book feels less squeamish about discussing colorectal health concerns at a later time, than Gomi will have done more than just entertain; the author may have also helped save a life. So buy &quot;Everyone Poops&quot; and share it with the ones you love.	2000-10-28

As a meditation from the mind of one of Mexico's greatest poets, this book is a valuable contribution to Latin American studies.<br />Paz begins by reflecting on the unique aspects of the literatures of the Americas. Then, after a brief autobiographical transition, he discusses his life-long pursuit of that elusive phenomenon known as &quot;modernity.&quot;<br />Although Paz has great insights, his words do tend to oversimplify issues at times. In his reflection on the literature of the Americas, for example, he acknowledges only the great national literatures written in Spanish, English, Portuguese, and French. Reading it made me want to exclaim, &quot;What about the rich tradition of oral literatures in Native American languages? Or the creole literatures of this hemisphere? What about those American writers who have composed their works in Yiddish and other &quot;marginal&quot; languages?&quot; (This criticism is ironic in light of the fact that Paz mentions Nahuatl, a native Mexican language, in passing towards the end of the address). This complaint aside, Paz remains provocative and compelling.<br />And his address yields a wealth of memorable, epigram-like insights. Consider this one: &quot;Poetry, in love with the instant, seeks to relive it in the poem, thus separating it from sequential time and turning it into a fixed present&quot; (p. 16).<br />All things considered, this is a significant text from one of the indispensable figures in the literatures of the Americas.	2000-10-27

The star of this book is five month old Galahad, who lives with his mother Gremlin and their extended family in Tanzania's Gombe National Park.<br />Although marketed as a children's book, this treasure is truly one for all ages. In fact, I bought a copy for my four year old nephew some time ago, but loved the book so much I kept it for myself! (Don't worry; I ordered a second copy for my nephew.)<br />This book is truly a portrait of an entire community. As Jane Goodall follows little Galahad and his mother through a typical day, we get to meet Gremlin's brothers, as well as the other chimpanzees who make up the larger group. Michael Neugebauer's keen eye captures many memorable images--some funny, some touching. Goodall's straightforward prose is the perfect complement to the wealth of beautiful, full-color images. Her insights into chimpanzee life make the book as educational as it is enjoyable.<br />&quot;The Chimpanzee Family Book&quot; reminds us that the strength of family and the joy of childhood are not exclusive to the human race. And the book is also a poignant reminder of the vital need to protect the chimpanzees from threats to their continued survival.<br />So whether you buy this book for your favorite child or your favorite adult, &quot;The Chimpanzee Family Book&quot; is sure to become a treasured favorite.	2000-10-27

Although many of the poems in this volume could stand on their own, this book is a truly unified work which should be read in its entirety.<br />William O'Daly has translated Neruda's Spanish into a simple but sensuous English free verse. In this bilingual edition, Neruda's poems stand side-by-side with O'Daly's excellent tranlations, making the book especially useful to English-speaking students of Spanish (or Spanish-speaking students of English). O'Daly's excellent introduction discusses the history and culture of Rapanui, and also discusses the background of Neruda's poetic interpretation of the island.<br />Neruda's poetry in &quot;The Separate Rose&quot; skillfully captures the complexity of the world of Rapanui. The poet's generous vision takes in both the motley tourists and the monumental stone sculptures that have made the island famous. In some of the book's most powerful poems, Neruda reflects on Lord Wind, the ancient deity said to have reigned over Rapanui.<br />And as always, Neruda demonstrates his command of poetic language. Whether describing airplanes as &quot;enormous aluminum geese&quot; (p. 15), reflecting on his own heritage as &quot;apprentice to volcanoes&quot; (p. 19), or addressing Rapanui as &quot;cry / of the mourning petrel, tooth of the sea&quot; (p. 51), Neruda always uses the tools of language in thought-provoking ways.<br />&quot;The Separate Rose&quot; is more than just an important part of a great poet's canon of writings; it is a moving reflection on a unique and timeless land.	2000-10-26

To that end the book contains a short introduction, along with profiles of 11 acts: Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Enrique Iglesias, Marc Anthony, C Note, Christina Aguilera, Chayanne, Elvis Crespo, Luis Miguel, Carlos Ponce, and Shakira.<br />To her credit, Krulik does pack a lot of essential information--discographies, television and movie appearances, biographical data--into each of the brief (between 6 and 25 pages each) profiles.<br />However, the book's main weakness is its selective nature. Krulik has chosen to profile only a handful of Latin artists, and I wonder why she selected these 11. I have nothing against C Note, for example, but they had only released a single album at the time this book appeared. There are a number of contemporary Latin acts who have been around longer and who had already produced 2, 3, or more fine albums by the time of this book's publication. Why, for example, was Frankie Negron not included? Or Jerry Rivera? Servando y Florentino? Leo Vanelli? Cesar Borja? Charlie Zaa? Each of these acts has the &quot;youth appeal&quot; which would have made their appearance in this book appropriate.<br />And while the book is informative and well-written as a whole, the author's frequent lapses into &quot;teenybopper style&quot; language will surely annoy older or more literate readers. In particular, I found her overuse of exclamation points to be distracting.<br />These criticisms aside, &quot;Pop Goes Latin&quot; is a good introduction to the eleven acts profiled. But as an introduction to the Latin music scene as a whole, it is insufficient.	2000-10-26

Along with such infamous volumes as &quot;Michelle Remembers,&quot; by Michelle Smith and Lawrence Pazder, Stratford's book claims to be the testimony of a survivor of Satanic ritual abuse.<br />Unfortunately for the marketers of this genre, every book of this type (to my knowledge) has been exposed as a hoax. Sociologist Jeffrey Victor, in his 1993 study &quot;Satanic Panic,&quot; offers a rational critique of the title phenomenon and of the bogus &quot;survivor&quot; stories that were so prevalent in the late 1980s.<br />Readers of earlier editions of &quot;Satan's Underground&quot; should have been suspicious from the start. The book is filled with unverifiable information. Although the author mentions being hospitalized, attending college, and moving from city to city, the names of these institutions and cities are never mentioned.<br />But beyond being an apparent hoax, &quot;Satan's Underground&quot; is also a bad piece of writing. Stratford's hysterical, melodramatic prose reads like an inept parody of a horror novel. A typical passage: &quot;Horror seized my mind. Terror froze my heart. The purest sacrifice, the most pleasing sacrifice--the one sacrifice I could never make unless my mind and will were completely broken--was the sacrifice of a child to Satan!&quot; (p. 99).<br />&quot;Satan's Underground&quot; is a significant textual artifact for scholars interested in the &quot;Satanic panic&quot; phenomenon of the 1980s. But as an alleged autobiographical work, the book lacks credibility. And as a piece of literature, the book is a failure.	2000-10-23

An amazingly concise and informative &quot;mini-encyclopedia,&quot; the book contains chronologically-ordered entries on major works of sacred literature.<br />This is truly a multifaith and multicultural guide, spanning the globe and the millennia. The Qur'an, the Pop Wuj (or Popol Vuh) of the Quiche Mayas, the Kojiki of Japan, the New Testament, the Dhammapada, the Zohar--all these and more are in here. Camphausen also includes texts--such as the Iliad or the Kalevala of Finland--which, despite their theological and supernatural content, are not always recognized as sacred literature. He treats each text respectfully and accurately, and frequently provides useful bibliographic references.<br />The book's many reproductions of sacred art make it a rich visual feast. Also noteworthy are the reproductions of pages from the actual works being described; Camphausen shows us the cuneiform of the Gilgamesh epic, the Egyptian hieroglyphics of the Pyramid Texts, and a wealth of other writing systems.<br />At just over 200 pages, this is far from a complete guide. Where, for example, is Mary Baker Eddy's &quot;Science and Health&quot;? The Urantia Book? The Principia Discordia? I'm sure other readers could cite additional oversights; perhaps these could be corrected in a future edition.<br />Despite these oversights, &quot;The Divine Library&quot; is an outstanding reference work. It is a book that I turn to frequently, and I highly recommend it.	2000-10-20

Well-written and logically organized, this is the best kind of reference book: both informative and fun to read.  Although the book's historical survey of the &quot;rat fancy&quot; concentrates primarily on the United Kingdom, this fascinating story will surely be appreciated by rat lovers throughout the world.<br />Mays not only creates an accurate and affectionate portrait of the domesticated rat, but he also creates a comparable portrait of those rat fanciers who have for generations taken these intelligent and personable creatures into our homes and hearts.  This book is a tribute to the strength of the bonds that can exist between members of different species.	2000-10-19

A Bay of Quinte Mohawk and an out-and-proud lesbian, Brant shares her insights on the struggles and the joys that come from being a part of both these worlds.<br />The text itself is a well-woven blend of fiction, poetry, and autobiographical fragments. The tone ranges from mythic to realistic, from tender to angry. The settings range from a 19th century Native American community to a 1960s mental ward. But from these varied elements Brant has fashioned a truly unified text. And whether she is writing about a grieving Indian mother or a young man facing anti-gay prejudice, Brant brings to her words both power and compassion.<br />If you are interested in Native American literature, women's studies, gay and lesbian studies, or just plain powerful writing, take a walk down the &quot;Mohawk Trail.&quot;	2000-09-30
