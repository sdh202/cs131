After the war he returned, to get his university education, and served as a correspondent for United press, ABC, and Newsweek.  This is an account of the occupation of Austria by Hitler, and what Vienna went through while part of Nazidom.  The account of the takeover by Hitler is of high interest and well-told.  The account of the war years is also well done but it was not as interesting.  In the final chapter Weyl gives a good account of Austria since the war, and shows that many Austrians exaggerate their resistance to Hitler. This is a book well worth reading if you want to know about Austria's fall and the dreary war years in Vienna, and the post-war course of Austria.  One is glad that so much that was destroyed in the war has been reconstituted.	2005-10-14

While it does not have the overpowering aura of authenticity that is inherent in Victor Klemperer's I Will Bear Witness (Volume I read by me on 11 June 1999 and Volume II on 7 Apr 2000), I was caught up by this account and though one knew she survived (else the book would not exist) one had to remind oneself of that as she went from situation to situation.  I think it necessary for one to remind oneself repeatedly of the inhuman behavior of so many people during the Hitler years, lest one take civil liberty for granted.  She does meet people who are human but also there are many who behaved in a way which they surely have regretted ever since--I hope.	2005-09-25

It is not.  It deals with the group, the Fight for Freedom Committe, which beginning about June 1940 called for a declaration of war against Hitler. While I know I was young during that time, I do not remember hearing about this group, altho I well remember William Allen White's group devoted to urging support for Britain as a way of defending the US.  The group which this book considers was a more radical group, since they advocated war be declared.  The group did valuable work in regard to the exchange of 50 destroyers for bases, and played an important role in preparing public opinion to accept that procedure.  It also made FDR's actions seem more modest and more acceptable to the bulk of the American people.  The Japanese and Hitler by their acts in December 1941 did the greatest job however in uniting the American people--and the organization which this book tells of became unnecessary.	2005-09-19

But the account soon caught me up and I was totally mesmerized, and the book I found to be a triumph, ranking with Alive, by Piers Paul Read, as one of the most gripping survival stories I have ever read.  I felt it was better than Touching the Void, by Joe Simpson, even though that book is on edge of the chair reading.  Despite Ralston's imprudent behavior I found him an admirable person and the fact that he is still climbing mountains and doing other unbelievable things I concluded was inspiring, imprudent as it no doubt is.  This is a great reading experience.	2005-09-16

He refers to similar books by Thomas Hart Benton (Thirty Years View), James G. Blaine (Twenty Years in Congress), and this book by George F. Hoar, which books served Clark as a model for his book.  John Sherman also has a memoir on his years, but even Champ Clark says Sherman's is dull.  I have now read Hoar's book and found it discursive but with lots of interesting things scattered through its over 900 pages.  Incidentally, Hoar says John Sherman did not write the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890  and probably never read it!  He relates with care and affection the years of his growing up, and the tremendous contrast between living in the 1820s and 1903--when his book was written.  (He died the year after it was published.)  He talks a lot about Senators and judges he knew, and nearly all his comments are laudatory, which makes them not too attention-holding.  The exception is Ben Butler.  He has much bad to say about Ben Butler, though he does name five things about him which he says were praiseworthy.  But these things are overwhelmed by the bad things he has to say about him.  Since so much of the book lauds folk, it is a pleasant change of pace to read him excoriating somebody!  Hoar had wise things to say about the folly of the US conquering the Phillipines, and I found his belief that the US should set a peaceful example of freedom which mankind will be glad to follow pertinent, inasmuch as he added that we should never force even freedom upon unwilling nations at the point of a bayonet or at the cannon's mouth. While Iraq reminds us of Vietnam, a closer parallel might be to the US experience in the Phillipines, where we insisted that we should conquer the \\"natives\\" so we could make them able to govern themselves.  Hoar believed they would have been able to govern themselves without us forcing them to submit to our instruction, and his words sound wisetoday. While I liked Champ Clark's book more, that may be due to the fact that his politics were not as antithetical to my inclinations as were Hoar's.	2005-08-28

An added attraction is that the history of the origin of the Servite order--possibly begun on the day St. Philip was born--is told.  The order did not obtain the definitive approval of the Church until Feb. 11, 1304--long after Philip's death.  Philip was canonized by Pope Clement X on Easter Sunday, 1671, at the same time as St. Francis Borgia, St Gaetano Cajetan, St. Louis Bertand, and St. Rose of Lima.  This is a well-done and very readable account of a great saint.	2005-08-20

The reason I do not give it five stars is because it has no footnotes and no bibliography.  For instance, on page 188 Schwartz refers to \\"Shaw's leading biographer\\" but does not name him nor the title or date of the biography.  How simple to have put a footnote on the page, but there is none.  But aside from this failing, this is a fun book to read and enjoy.	2005-08-14

I have not read Stanley Karnow's book on Vietnam although I found his Pulitzer-Prize-winning book In Our Image, on the Phillipines exceptionally good.  My only complaint about this book is that it is hard to read straight through since the sidebars don't end on the same page and so sometimes one is reading a sidebar and when finishing it has to go back and find out where one left on in the main text.  But if one wants a balanced view of the conflict--probably more critical of the war than some enthusiasts for it--this is the book to read.	2005-08-09

The chapters will be more interesting to the extent you are interested in the topic, but I thought the food chapter was exceptional, as it told us things like what Diamond Jim Brady ate for breakfast.

There are no foootnotes and the three-page bibliography shows there is no original research.  But for all that it is a good work, telling the story reign-by-reign from the time of the Romans till about 2002.  After you read it you should read 1066 and All That, since you will be prepared to appreciate even more the humor of that great volume.  I also found the account of Britain since the Second World War of great interest--maybe because it was turning into history what one has pcked up day by day during the period involved.  The whole volume is easy to read and tells a great story.	2005-07-29

It covers the years from 1915 to his death just after  the Scopes trial in 1925.  It shows that Bryan was of importance in the enactment of five constitutional amendments:  the 16th, the 17th, the 18th, the 19th, and the 20th (even tho the 20th did not come to fruition till after his death).  The account of the Scopes trial is carefully done, though Coletta does show some of the more glaring failings of Bryan in his duel with Darrow.  A good and a bit more balanced account of that trial can be found in Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion, by Edward J. Larson  (read 3 Oct 1998)  (Pulitzer History prize for 1998).   <br />	2005-07-10

The account of the Democratic Convention in 1912 is one of the highlights of the book, and makes clear that Bryan was responsible for Wilson being chosen in that dramatic convention--the account cannot help but make one nostalgic for those bygone days when presidential nominating conventions were meaningful and full of suspense.  Except for Bryan, Champ Clark would have been nominated and elected president--and it is mind-boggling to think about how the world's history would have been changed by such a result at the convention.  The treatment of Bryan's time as Secreatary of State I did not think as well done as Arthur Link's account in his volumes on Wilson's presidency. see Wilson: The Struggle for Neutrality 1914-1915, by Arthur S. Link  (read 4 July 1980)  A minor flaw in this book is that while the footnotes are where thay are supposed to be, at the foot of each page, the bibliography does not list all the books cited in the footnotes!  A good corrective for this book's treatment of Wilson's course up to 1917 is The World War and American Isolation 1914-1917, by Ernest R. May  (read 1 Nov 1984).   <br /> <br />	2005-07-10

The account of the Cross of Gold speech on July 9, 1896, is as riveting account of that most momentous speech in American political history as I have ever read.  I was also surprised by how interesting the account of the 1904 Democratic Convention was--I had never heretofore felt the 1904 polical events of much interest.  Coletta writes balanced history and does not hesitate to point out Bryan's faults, showing he was not a great thinker, was very stubborn and sure of his rightness, having little interest in history or literature.  But the role he played was crucial in making the modern Democratic Party.  If you like political history you will enjoy this volume.	2005-07-10

After you have read the book you will want to read the opinion of the Iowa Supreme Court in State v. Hossack, 116 Iowa 194, 89 N.W. 1077 (1902).  I have never seen better research and insight into the legal events connected with a crime--actually more authentic than Capote's In Cold Blood.

When the book was written the desire to avoid \\"another Vietnam\\" was strong.  Our present President has however disregarded that desire and one would like to have an updated version of the author's thoughts on how Vietnam has affected the present war--which has proven the prescience of the first President Bush in avoiding a prolonged first Gulf War.  This book is as fine a discussion of the aftereffects of Vietnam as I have read--I only wish it were updated to consider the events since 1997.	2005-06-20

The book is made up of two parts.  Part I is called the Social Record, and includes in chronological order articles that Malcolm Cowley published from 1930 to 1941 in the New Republic concerning issues, problems, and ideas of the period.  Though the book was published in 1967, and many of the thoughts expressed in the articles are now obviously simply wrong, the publication of them gives an insight into the thinking of a convinced left-winger who in the early years of the 1930s had only admiration for the tyranny which was being carried out by Stalin--in accord with the thinking of many in those years.  (In 1935 Cowley wrote \\"The strength of the Soviet writers lies in the fact that the political leaders want and need their support, and are willing to grant a great deal of intellectual liberty at the price of receiving it.\\"  A 1967 footnote says \\"This deluded comment must stand for the record.\\")  Part II of the book contains many of Cowley's short book reviews, again from 1930 to 1941, published in the New Republic.  These stand the passage of the years much better than his comments on the political scene and are of much interest.  I found this book an interesting window in the history of the 1930s.	2005-05-28

This book is very fair and balanced in its consideration of this intricate question, and his conclusion (\\"the theoretical structure they (scholastic scholars) erected was not a consistent piece, but it encouraged risk-taking investment and charity to the poor; its practical success may be measured by a comparison between the conditions of credit in medieval Europe and those in classical Greece or China or India.\\") is persuasive.

It gets only four stars, though, since it has no bibliography and its source notes are skimpy and not indicated by footnote numbers.  Faubus was born in poverty and named Orval Eugene, with the Eugene being in honor of Eugene Debs, prominent Socialist leader admired by Orval's father. In Orval's youth he flirted with socialism and later lied about it in his political campaigns.  When he saw the fierceness of reaction involved with the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, he ignored the rightness of the integration decision and plumped onto the side of the racists.  If he had done otherwise he no doubt would not have been governor of Arkansas for 12 years (1955-1967) even though he would have been on the side of decency and right  The years when Faubus was governor were hard years for fair-minded people, though a bit later, Dale Bumpers showed that decent people could be elected in Arkansas.  It is interesting to contrast Faubus' career with that of Dale Bumpers (told with a light touch in Bumpers' engaging memoir, The Best Lawyer in a One-Lawyer Town), but Bumpers came along a bit later and was able to be elected despite the racist tenets of some of his constituents.  This book is well worth reading.	2005-05-14

I remember when I read Frederick Lewis Allen's classic, Only Yesterday (on May 21, 1946), how enthralled I was by the account of the years just before my ken.  Much of the same fascination fuels my appreciation for this book, which considers the forces in the Democratic Party in the Twenties and early Thirties and the struggles between them.  The author's thesis is that the Democratic Party was at least in the Conventions of the 1920's controlled by the conservative wing, and we know that some of those conservatives left the party in the New Deal days.  I found the book full of interesting things, such as a clear explanation of why after the 103 ballots in 1924 the Houston convention in 1928 naminated Al Smith on the first ballot--a result which might mystify but which this book explains convincingly.  Anyone who enjoys political history will be caught up by this carefully researched book--I was.	2005-04-30

Augustus Caesar Dodge was the first man born west of the Mississippi River to become a United States Senator, as well as the first Iowa Senator.  (I call him that because he was the first man chosen by the Iowa Legislature as U.S. Senator--in 1848, tho Iowa was admitted to the Union in 1846!)  Before Iowa was a state Dodge served as a Delegate to Congress and did yeoman work for the future state.  The account in this book of the border dispute with Missouri is especially revealing, few Iowans today being aware of the state's victory in the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Missouri v. Iowa, 7 How. 660 (1849), which defintively settled the southern boundary of Iowa.  While unfortunately Dodge had a benighted view on slavery, on many other questions he was a statesman.  After his defeat in 1854 he served as Minister to Spain, and his efforts there to secure Cuba for the U.S. were strenuous but unsuccessful.  How different the years since 1858 would have been had Cuba become a part of the U.S. back then!  Your time spent reading this old book will be well spent.	2005-04-28

Especially interesting is his account of St. Anthony's Church in Hoven, South Dakota, often called \\"The Cathedral of the Prairies\\" even though it is not a cathedral strictly speaking--it was just built with the magnificence which is sometimes put into a cathedral.  As I read the account I surely wished that I could at once go to Hoven and see the church, which apparently has not been 'modernized' to such an extent as to lose the character which inspired the builders.  The account of how some of these great Dakota churches have been done over so as to destroy their original appearance is so sad, but the people and priests at Hoven did not succumb to the fever which swept thru land in the sixties and seventies.  It is also of interest that some of the destruction which was done to historic churches in that era is now being undone and the churches are being restored to their original magnificence.  The book is a book to treasure, and one is grateful to the authors despite their seeming to be somewhat unfamiliar with Catholicism and its tenets and practices.  Anyone interested in church architecture and living in or planning to visit North or South Dakota should glory in this book.	2005-04-28

Thus it considers the tariff history of the US up to 1923.  Taussig makes a lot of sense when he discusses tariffs, and his discussion shows that ordinarily the Democrats had a sounder position on tariffs than did the Republicans.  Does anyone know of a book which would cover the tariff question from 1923 to the present?

The accused and wronged man charged with the murder brought suit against the law people who wronged him.  That dispute reached the US Supreme Court.  Readers of this book might be interested in reading the opinions in McMillian v. Monroe County, Ala., 520 U.S. 781, 117 S.Ct. 1734 (1997).

These accounts are of much interest, even though sometimes one suspects there is some extravagance involved in the telling, though no one can doubt that fearful things were undergone by the men who served in German submarines.  But I thought the book poorly organized, and there are no footnotes or scholarly apparatus.  The men involved try to put themselves and the German U-boat service in the best light, and this is to be expected.  One wonders whether these men really wish that Hitler had won the war.  I suppose they do, and this is sobering--are there thousands of Germans who are sorry Hitler lost?  I suppose so.  None of the men interviewed for this book ever indicate that they recognize the cause they fought for was an evil cause--they fought for  their country, right or wrong.  Folk who glory in the Decatur toast should sometimes think that it is that attitude--my country, right or wrong--which inspired Germans and Japanese in World War Two and which inspires today's terrorists.	2005-03-05

The account by John Knox of how he came to be Justice McReynolds' law clerk and the odd life had to lead as such clerk is of much interest.  I have seldom read a memoir of greater interest than is this one.  Knox himself is a most unusual person, having a effrontery which amazes one looking at it from the viewpoint of history.  The book is magnificently edited, with citations which enable one in this computer age to look up the cases mentioned and live the time with Knox.  Knox's subsequent career is also of interest, and poignant.  This book is a winner, and anyone interested in Supreme Court history will find reading this book extremely rewarding	2005-02-16

Burdick	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Excellent biography of life and times	Those of you who read the author's Prairie Rebel: The Public Life of William Lemke rightfully can expect that this will be a well-researched and attention-holding book.  Usher Burdick was born 21 Feb 1879 near Owatonna, Minn., and played a leading role in North Dakota's political history from his first tem in the Legislature beginning in 1907 till he finished his tenth term in Congress in 1959.  The account of the tumultuous politics of North Dakota during the Non-Partisan League days and on through the Depression years in this book is intriguing, and while Usher Burdick had his oddities and failings he was pretty consistent in holding the affections of the liberal (as well as the isolationist) wing of the electorate during the years. The reader will find that the politics of North Dakota makes the political history of most other states seem pretty tepid.  People who enjoy this book should also read History of North Dakota by Elwyn B. Robinson and North Dakota: A Bicentennial History, by Robert P. Wilkins et al.	2005-02-15

He underwent much training, survived horrific experiences, and never seemed to lose his wish to die for his country, even after the Emperor said Japan must surrender.

The author is no lawyer, since he has things like a deed, which in Iowa needs to be signed before a notary public, signed with no notary present.  But these are quibbles.  The book catches one up, tho the dialogue is awkward, and  gloom and doom pervade the book.  There is a description of a near lynching of a judge, and such an incident did happen in LeMars, Iowa, in 1933--but the judge was courageous rather than evil as the judge in this book is depicted. By 1935 such an incident would have been quite unlikely. I found only one mention of the author in the Time archives, which I set out herewith: <br /> <br />Sirs:  <br /> <br />Your article on schoolmarm Campbell's one-room Iowa school brings back many, fond memories. I spent the first eight years of my schooling in just such an institution including the black stove in the centre of the room. Such an educational beginning has always seemed to me to be adequate, providing one is a consistent and thorough reader of TIME.  <br /> <br />But your writer failed to make clear one point: did the kids raise one finger or two fingers before going out to the privy ? As I recall, schoolmarms were sharply divided into those advocating the raising of one finger and those advocating the raising of two fingers. There was always considerable suspense among the kids at every change of teachers until that detail was settled. We were never told how many fingers to raise, and the schoolmarm never wrote such instructions on the blackboard in our presence. But after a recess period, or coming to school in the morning we found the instructions written neatly on the blackboard and the teacher very preoccupied with something on her desk.  <br /> <br />As I remember, I preferred the two finger category of schoolmarms.  <br /> <br />PAUL COREY Cold Spring, N.

Yes, this book should have footnotes and a decent bibliography, but it is such a felicitous treatment of its intensely interesting subject that it merits five stars.  I have long looked on In Flander Fields, by Leon Wolff (read by me 8 June 1965, and that year winner of my Best Book Read This Year award) as having told me all I needed to know about the Flanders fighting.  But that book covered only the 1917 time in Flanders.  This book does the first battle of Ypres in 1914, the second (in 1915), the third in 1917, and the 4th in 1918.  In fact, this short book does a able job on the war itself--and serves as a bit of corrective to Wolff's damning view of Haig.  Not that Haig gets the kind of favorable treatment that John Terraine gives him in his book, Ordeal of Victory (read by me with much appreciation on 16 May 1986), but one can see that there is something to be said for Terraine's thesis that the foundations of victory were laid on the Somme in 1916 and in Flanders in 1917 and that if those battles had not been fought the German drive in 1918 would have won the war for Germany.  Groom is a popular historian only but he does an able job in this book, and I found it compelling reading.	2005-01-27

I thought the early part of the book was not very attention-holding and in trying to analyze why I concluded that it was because the author is so eager to give us his politically correct opinion--whereas if he had been more objective his thesis would have been better illustrated.  Don't get me wrong, I agree entirely with the author's views but I just thought that parading them was detracting and he would have been better advised to be more objective.  But the book becomes more attention-holding as we get to the trials, and the latter part of the book is excellent reading.  The research is impeccable.  I so appreciate authors who go to original sources rather than using a secondary source for things they could go to original sources for.  I was struck by the fact that Supreme Court Justice-to-be Frank Murphy, Reinhold Niebuhr, and David Lilienthal, all before they became famous, had roles in the events which are the central concern of the book related to  Detroit in 1925.  And the portrayal of Clarence Darrow and his methods is really well-done.  On balance, the book is well worth reading.	2005-01-22

The account of how he and his parents got out of Hitler's grasp is vivid and breathtaking, and alone is worth the price of the book.  Then his account of growing up in New York, his education in high school and college, and how he became connected with the New York Times is of sustaining interest, as is his account of his career there.

The author's research seems to be thorough and he went to archives and to the sites important to the story he tells as he wrote his book.  There are no footnotes as such, but there are source notes and a bibliography which satisfies me that this is a competent and trustworthy accoount of a rivetingly daring expedition.  It is at times compellingly exciting, to such an extent that one had to remind oneself that they did find the strait which bears Magellan's name and did get thru it.  This book is a winner.	2004-12-13

This book is by Ruth Hanna McCormick's granddaughter but she never knew her grandmother - and was probably better able to gain information which her relatives had.  I found this account of the life of the first woman ever to be nominated by a major political party for a US Senate seat to be well-written and to tell well the interesting life which Ruth Hanna MCCormick Simms led.  Ruth was the daughter of Mark Hanna, the man who made William McKinley president, and she married the brother of Colonel Robert McCormick, longtime boss of the Chicago Tribune.  Her husband won a Senate seat in 1918 defeating the legendary J. hamilton Lewis.  After her husband was defeated for reelection and took his own life, his widow was elected to Congress in 1928, and then ran for the Seante in 1930, defeating the incumbent Senator in the Republican primary but in turn losing to--J. Hamilton Lewis, the man her husband had beaten 12 years earlier.  Thereafter she married a man who was a New Mexico Congressman when she met him--he exchanged seats with a Congressman who before the exchange would lean past Mrs. McCormick to use the spittoon.  The book also includes a detailed account of Mrs. Simms' effort to make Tom Dewey President in 1940 and reveals interesting aspects of the 1940 campaign and tells how Dewey rebuffed her help in 1944.  I found the book a fascinating look into political life from the woman's suffrage effort (in which Mrs. McCormick played a leading role) to the 1940s.  Don't avoid this book merely because it was written by a granddaughter.	2004-12-07

This book tells well the story of exciting things, from well-known ones like the Armada in 1588 to lesser known but equally fascinating things such as the work that Samuel Pepys did to make the British Navy the dominant force it was in his day and in the days thereafter.  Reading this book one understands William Cowper's lines in \\"The Castaway\\" when he says \\"No braver chief could Albion boast than he with whom he went, Nor ever ship left Albion's coast with warmer wishes sent,\\"  referring to Anson's trip around the world in 1740-1744.  The Nelson story is well covered, as is the role of the British Navy in the 19th century.  The book's footnoting leaves something to be desired, since only by referring to the endnotes themselves can you determine if a reference for a statement is given, and there is no bibliography as such.  When will publishers learn that endnotes and footnotes in themselves do not take the place of a real bibliography?  There are conclusions which some will quarrel with, and there are small mistakes, such on page 511 where it is stated that Wilson asked Congress to declare war on April 6, 1917, whereas the correct day is April 2, 1917, and on page 532 where the author says Mussolini invaded Yugoslavia in 1940, whereas it was Greece he invaded.  But these are minor flaws which do not detract enough to give the book less than five stars.	2004-12-02

It is excellently researched and unfailingly interesting.  I cannot believe that it will not win this year's Pulitzer Prize for biography.  Chernow shows what a great man Hamilton was without overlooking the dumb things he did.  So while Hamilton is not canonized, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson are shown to have been possibly not the wholly admirable figures which David McCullough and Dumas Malone painted them to be.  This is an overpoweringly good book, and the account of the duel has not so far as I know ever been better told.  I frankly will be surprised if it does not win the Pulitzer Prize for Biography next April.	2004-11-28

I have often thought such words were overdrawn, since I usually want to finish what I am reading so as to read something else.  But NOT this book.  I found the book page after page compelling reading, and could not help but be fascinated by the accounts of the high stakes litigation in which Boies was continually engaged. Even a case like the Microsoft anti-trust case, dealing with high tech issues not easy to comprehend, is very well-told and enlightening.  This great book concludes with 120 pages on the behind the scene and on the scene account of Bush v. Gore, and tells that complex story clearly and with devastating clarity as to what happened. How Boies could so ably handle such momentous cases in as short a time as he sets out--1997 to 2000--is hard to believe but we know he did.  Nor is the usual fault of lawyer books--puffing themselves--evident in this well-written volume.  He lets his results do the illuminating of his ability.  As the author says, each of the cases he discusses could be the subject of a book in itself and in a way one wishes that each were.  This is a marvelous book, which was a sheer joy to read and savor.	2004-11-12

Benton was born near Hillsboro, N.C. in March of 1782.  He attended the University of North Carolina and apparently was forced to leave because of a suspicion of theft!  He was one of Missouri's first two Senators and served from Aug 21, 1821, till March 3, 1851--the longest consecutive Senate service up to that time.  He was a dominating figure in the Seante, and was not outshone by Webster, Clay, and Calhoun--all of whom were at times in the Senate while Benton was there.

The author gives his views on the relationship between the principals and others assumed to be romantically connected with them, and his opinions seem solidly based on what can be known.  The same is true in his discussion of the Mayerling tragedy.  There are footnotes, though not excessive in amount, and the bibliography though now dated is ample.

Books	5	21	21	N	N	Crammed with interesting things	Ike Hoover was sent to the White House by his employer on May 6, 1891, to install electrical lighting.  He stayed there for 42 years, till he died Sept 14, 1933.  This book is a compilation of his notes on those 42 years.  He compares the different styles of living of the nine presidents he served under:  Harrison, Cleveland, McKinley, TR Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover, and has things to say about each.  He is somewhat deferential to his employers, but we get to know what he thinks despite that.  This is not a profound book but is full of things interesting to anyone caught up by political history.  I decided to read it because so often it is cited in books dealing with the political events of those years.  Some of the things he says tantalize.  For instance, he says he opened post office addresses under assumed names for two president.  Now why do you think they wanted such an address?  And he does tell you what he thinks--for instance he seems sure that Calvin Coolidge was very unhappy that he was not nominated by the Republicans in 1928, even though he issued his statement \\"I do not choose to run for President in 1928.\\"  Apparently he wanted to be chosen without his having to \\"run\\"?

But I do have one gripe about the book--its source notes, listed by chapter, fail to give the page where the clause introducing the source notes appears in the book!  This failure is really unconscionable, since to find if there is a source note for something one needs to go over all the notes for the chapter involved--and the chapters are not identified by page numbers either, so one needs to determine what chapter one is in and then go down the list of source notes to see if any are what one is looking for.  This is a foolish error which could have been cured so easily.  If the book is reprinted I hope that the source notes will be paginated.  But except for this, the book is good reading.	2004-08-22

This one certainly is.  And I found it greatly worth reading though one cannot help but be appalled by the subject: an adulterer many times over, quarreling with his friends as well as all his publishers, a man of unbelievable crudity, an admirer of both Stalin and Hitler, a rabid anti-Semite, a vicious anti-Catholic.  While few books can equal the merit of Swanberg's classic Sickles the Incredible, this biography is eminently readable and holds one's attention to the last page.  It is the ninth book by Swanberg I have read, and I admit I read this because I knew Swanberg did such a good job with his books, not because I was so interested in Theodore Dreiser.	2004-08-09

Jacob Ritner is a remarkable figure, inspiring admiration and eminently worthy of emulation.  His accounts of the battles he was in are vivid and immediate, and the editor of this volume has performed a most worthwhile service in resurrecting from the buried past this correspondence to inspire all who value patriotism and fidelity to duty and to one's marriage vow.  One cannot but be enriched by following Captain Ritner and his wife thru those perilous years from 1861 thru 1865.	2004-08-05

This is an exceptionally excellent book, replete with snatches of humor and wise and poignant thoughts.  It is indeed a memoir rather than an autobiography, and does not dwell much on the author's illustrious career as governor and senator.  The best chapters are toward the end, when he tells of his crowning achievemnet after he left the Senate and gave his superlative speech in the trial in the Senate of Bill Clinton.  I am glad he set that speech out in an appendix since I had forgotten just how able it was.  This book is a great book, and one can recomment it unreservedly.	2004-08-03

Included are well-written accounts of the Medusa in 1816 and the horror the survivors underwent, of the Mutiny on the Somers in 1842, of the Birkenhead loss in 1852, of the Central America loss in 1857 (the subject of another great book, Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea, by Gary Kinder), of the Saginaw (an amazing account of a Pacific wreck) in 1870, of the Mary Celeste in 1872, of the Victoria loss in 1893 (the subject of the great book by Richard Hough: Admirals in Collision), of the loss of No. 6, an early Japanese submarine in 1910, of the Titanic in 1912, of the battle of Jutland in 1916 (also brilliantly told about in Castles of Steel by Robert K. Massie), of the daring Italians sinking Austrian ships in 1918, of the last wreck of a sailing vessel in 1929, of the battle involving the Admiral Graf Spee in 1939, of the Houston loss in 1942, of the battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944, of the awful Pacific typhoon in 1944, and of the 1945 battle off Okinawa.  All of these events are succinctly and authoritatively told about, and this book is a great reference work to have on hand if you are interested in sea losses and battles.	2004-07-11

But the difference here is that Bob Dubois never learns, he repeatedly does the dumb thing, whether it is adultery or use of dope or abusing his wife or his poor innocent children.  One can hardly help being disgusted by a man who does not seem to have a brain in his body.  Only a moron would break all the windows in his own car when he is short of money for his wife and kids, or wreck his home, or booze and do dope when he does not know how to pay for necessary care for his child.  As for all the stuff about voodoo this may be interest to some but to me was a bore.  Surely the account of the Haitians' plight is distressing, but it helps to make this book a depressing one.  Frankly I was glad when I finished this pretentious and not well-written book, and thought Dubois got what he asked for and deserved.	2004-05-24

I admit my interest in the subject stems from the fact that my nine times great grandmother was the defendant in a witch trial in 16th century Germany. in which she was ably defended and was vindicated.  The introduction to this fine volume reads in part:  &quot;The bleak terrain of the witch trials is both forbidding and depressing.  Their vast scale must daunt any writer who hopes to explain the dynamics and significance of witch hunting, while the story of the trials also is bound to provoke discouraging conclusions about the human potential for inhumanity.  Yet the witch craze's prominence in the history of the period necessitates the broadest possible treatment, not only chronologically and spatially but also conceptually.  Our current knowledge of political institutions, social structure, and patterns of thought should be brought to bear when placing witch hunts in their historical context.&quot;  The book succeeds admirably in carrying out the announced aim.  It is the best treatment of the subject I know of.	2004-05-11

Its footnotes constitute a good commentary on World War One books and show that in Britain a lot of good writing is going on on that subject.  The first four chapters give a military history of the war.  Then there are three excellent chapters on the politicians and generals of the war.  Finally there are good chapters on &quot;Men and Munitions.&quot; &quot;Comradeship, Discipline, and Morale&quot; and &quot;Values and Ideas.&quot;  One must agree with the author when he says the only thing worse than a war won is a war lost.

The book pays very little attention to the Dominions--it is written strictly from a British viewpoint and examines exhaustively events in Britain druing the war, as well as all aspects of the war which relate to England.  There are more than 150 pages of text which follow the account of the Armistice, talking about the effects of the War on society, economics, etc.  The book has footnotes (where they belong, at the &quot;foot&quot; of the page) but lacks any bibliography.  I have read scores of books on the Great War, and consider it one of my favorite reading topics, but I found this one a chore to read at times.  A better book written from a similar perspective is Blighty: British Society in the Era of the Great War, by Gerard J. DeGroot.  Also more interesting in general I thought was The Deluge: British Society and the First World War, by Arthur Marwick.	2004-04-24

The central character, outside of his personal morals, is an admirable lawyer with whom one cannot help but empathize.  And tho there are evil lawyers and judges portrayed, the book does not seek to demonize the profession, and at the end the lawyer hero does not go off to some tropical island so he won't have to practice law any more.  A most welcome relief to the lawyer-bashing books a la Grisham.  One of the best legal thrillers I have ever read.	2004-04-12

Geoffrey Ward's two volumes, Before the Trumpet, and A First-Class Temperament are better written and more carefully researched, but they only take his life to 1928.  This book relies on secondary sources mostly, and its footnoting is unhelpful--the footnotes just tell what secondary source the author got the information from.  I have not read the multi-volume works of Frank Friedel and Kenneth Davis, but they are referred to a lot in the footnotes to this book and no doubt are more carefully researched.  Yet I thought reading this worthwhile, and its overall assessment of FDR's accomplishments rings very true.  George Will and Bill Buckley, Jr., and Henry Kissinger supplied blurbs for the jacket, which more hidebound Republicans, clinging to GOP attitudes during Roosevelt's Administrations would not, I presume, do.  Black's assessment of FDR's performance at Teheran and Yalta ably refutes some of the old Republican canards re same, and make for good reading.  All in all, I thought the time spent reading this nice big book was well spent.  There are a few errors, and I mention two: on page 233 Black refers to Senator Harry Flood Byrd as a Virginia favorite son candidate at the 1932 Democratic National Conventio--but at the time Byrd was not yet a Senator; and on page 792 Black says Admiral Darlan's funeral in Algiers on Dec 26, 1942, was attended by the &quot;Cardinal-Primate&quot; of Africa, but there was no Cardinal in Africa in 1942, much less a Cardinal-Primate. The book does have a good 25-page bibliography.	2004-04-05

There is not a bad chapter in the book, and I read it more avidly than any book I can remember.  The accounts of the sea battles--Coronel, Falkland Islands, Helgoland Bight, Dogger Bank, Jutland,--are very well-done and make those events clearer to us than to the people who fought them.  This is a sheerly stupendous work and anyone who has any interesst in World War One will be thankful he or she has lived to be able to read it.  The only mistake I noted is that he refers to &quot;Senator Williams of Tennessee&quot; when he means &quot;Senator Williams of Mississippi.&quot;  Other than that one mistake this is a perfect book and is I am sure the winner of my &quot;Best Book Read Award&quot; for this year.	2004-03-06

I was also annoyed by the apparent approval we were expected to give to the central character's belief that her cloistered twin sister was &quot;throwing her life away.&quot;  The scenario is pretty incredible, and the out of wack reaction Mary has when she gets mad seemed so stupid for a smart lawyer, and made me wonder how smart she could really be.

She does not fail to tell of her in some respects sad personal life, including her moral failings, (e.g., her affair with a Georgetown law professor, named in the book) and outlines in readable and convincing style her activities as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and as a very active and successful Secretary of State.

Daniel served on the U.S. Supreme Court from Mar 2, 1841 till he died in 1860.  This biography is well-done, not only on his Court years but on the interesting career he had in Virginia before he became a judge.  The footnoting is superb, and citations to cases in which Daniel was involved are plentiful  It is worth reading this book to learn of the amazing way he managed to get onto the Court, even though the vacancy occurred on Feb 25, 1841 and President Van Buren's term expired March 4, 1841.  Yet in the period before Van Buren's term expired Daniel was confirmed, even though all the Whig Senators opposed him and all but one left the Senate Chamber when his nomination was voted on.  This amazing contrast to the present day procedure when dealing with Supreme Court nominations will surprise you, and simply to learn this is worth reading the book.  Anyone interested in ante-bellum U.S. history will appreciate this book and I recommend it to such folk unreservedly	2004-01-14

But it is not hagiographical even though the author, now deceased, knew Jeannette Rankin.  Most people know that Rankin voted against war twice--even though she only served two terms in the House, having been elected in 1916 to her first term--the first woman elected to Congress--and then elected to her second term in 1940.  So when Pearl Harbor was bombed she was the only person who voted against war--though a few days later she voted for war against Germany.  She was somewhat eccentric and was active in the anti-war movement during the Vietnam era though not in full sync with the moving spirits in that endeavor.  She lived on till she was almost 93, active and forceful till the end.  While the book has no footnotes and is kind of amateurishly written it tells an interesting story, and gives a fuller picture of an amazing woman than most folks have had hitherto.	2004-01-05

[read 9 Apr 1952], Right Hand, Glove Uplifted [read Jun 30, 1983], I Came Out of the 18th Century [read 3 Feb 1979], I, Too, Have Lived in Arcadia [read 26 Feb 1987], Keep the Aspidistra Flying [read 2 Apr 2002], and What Me Befell [read 24 Feb 2001]).  But it turned out to be a super-interesting book, especially when it got to the actual events leading up to the negotiations with Napolean.  One stands in awe of the superlative job which Livingston did in conditioning Napoleon to be willing to sell and the suspense which attends the negotiations is surprising (since one know that it all turns out for the best, because here I am living in Iowa and an American citizen).  The research is impeccable, and the footnotes ample, and one is even favored with the text of Pinckney's treaty of 1795 as well as of the Treaty to buy Louisiana.  (In the next edition the statement on page 251 that Napoleon died on Elba should be corrected, as well as the statement on page 272 saying Livingston met Talleyrand on &quot;January&quot; 12 instead of April 12, 1803.)  The book is full of interesting tidbits, such as telling what happened to Shays of Shays' Rebellion fame, and to Toussaint after the promise to him was broken and he was arrested.  This is history which cannot fail to be appreciated when read.	2003-12-24

Especially worthwhile to me was Chapter 14, entitled &quot;The Dead, the Living, and the Living Dead&quot; which considers memorials and observances of the men who served in the War. An especially attractive feature of DeGroot's style is his frequent quoting from wartime poetry.  For instance, I was struck by these evocative lines quoted from Ivor Gurney:<br />He's gone, and all our plans<BR>   Are useless indeed;<BR>We'll walk no more on Cotswold<BR>   Where the sheep feed<BR>   Quietly and take no heed.<br />There is an excellent bibliography and I counted 24 books therein which I have read.

Douglas	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Absorbingly interesting and readable	The author has done a good job researching the way a biographer should--he checks sources which some might find too tedious to dig out.  So he has come up with information which shows that it is not wise to rely on autobiography for the facts in some csses.  The legal analysis in regard to Douglas's work on the Court is not very profound, but I don't suppose most readers want the detail which a good law review would give to the very interesting work the Supreme Court did during Douglas' time on the bench.  The unadmirable aspects of his personal life and character are set forth with devastating detail, though the author I think admires some of good work on the Court which his subject did.  Anyone interested in the Supreme Court will find this book greatly absorbing, and anyone interested in the amazing events surrounding the selection of Truman as FDR's running mate in 1944 cannot omit reading this book--and looking at the photos!  In this respect, if you have not read Choosing Truman: The Democratic Convention of 1944 by Robert H.

This story alone makes this book one that one should own, and there are 66 other great short stories therein (some not so short--for instance Billie Budd, Foretopman is included).

Desmond Seward is a popularizer, and this book has no footnotes, but it is a fantastic book and is fast reading. It tells the almost unbelievable story of Napolean and his siblings:  Joseph (1768-1844), Lucien (1775-1840), Elisa (1777-1820), Louis (1778-1846), Pauline (1780-1824), Caroline (1782-1839) and Jerome (1784-1860).  What an immoral lot--one is shocked by the sexual excess thay all indulged in.  This is a good book, with a genealogical table and telling what became of them and their descendants.  But the way Seward writes, it is not serious history.  But it is fun to read, and you will be amazed by how quickly Napolean and his family assumed the vices of royalty.	2003-09-05

I was surprised how what he said resonated with me--filled with opposition to German militarism and detestion of the Nazi horror.  I was again reminded of Hesse's greatness, and I don't see how the language of the translation could be better.  I was greatly moved by the proof that there were good Germans who cringed in pain as they watched the slide to Hitlerian madness.

I would have liked a list of the graduating members of the class of 1966--maybe with their rank from 1st to last, and with Gold Stars by those who died for their country.

It tells well the story of George Wallace, four-times governor of Alabama, and his time, and is well footnoted with a good bibliography.  It is disturbing that as recently as 1972 a blatantly racist message could resonate so powerfully not only in Alabama but in other states as well.  A few years ago the ban on miscegenation which was in the Alabama Constitution was repealed by the people of Alabama (tho it had been inoperative by reason of a US Supreme Court ruling long before)and I found that encouraging, but one has to fear that many of the people who so raucously supported the bigoted and corrupt regime of Wallace as recently as 1972 may not have repented.  Reading this book is as sobering as thinking about the fact that millions in Germany as recently as 1939 supported Nazidom.	2003-08-14

This is shown in a way since after reading it I conclude the U.S Supreme Court's decision was right--in the circumstances shown the family could without monetary loss have permitted their child to not be starved to death.  The account of the trial and of the appellate history of the case is absorbing and shows the author is an able lawyer, admirable in representing his clients.  I have no hesitancy in saying if it had been my child I would not have gone to the efforts which Nancy's father went to in order to have his child die.  But psychologically Nancy's parents wanted the living death to end and their lawyer was right to seek the relief his clients desired.  An extraordinary book.	2003-08-04

I read Iris Murdoch's The Sea, The Sea, (which won the 1978 Booker Prize) on Dec 4, 1983, and her Under the Net (which was no. 95 on the Modern Library panel's list of the 100 greatest novels written in English in the 20th century) and was under-enthralled with both.  So I wa not expecting much when I undertook to read her husband's memoir of his life with her (written during the last days of her life, she having died Feb. 8, 1999), especially since I could not believe it would be great to read about someone having Alzheimer's and of caring for such a person.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Bayley's memoir is great reading, full of interesting information as well as a thoughtful and truthful-sounding account of their life as husband and wife.  Illustrative of the former, on page 118 we learn that Aldous Huxley believed that Piero della Francesca's Resurrection was &quot;the greatest painting in the world&quot; (and it is great to go to the computer and see the painting!) and on page 164 et seq. we have a very uncomplimentary account of the 1981 Nobel-prize-winner Elias Canetti (his name is never mentioned, but there can be no doubt of his identity since the computer will tell those of us who did not know that Canetti is the author of Die Blendung).  We have mention of Montague Rhodes James (and can go to the computer to read his some of his ghost stories, including &quot;The Treasure of Abbot Thomas&quot;, the story referred to by name in this memoir).  Since Bayley is an eminent literary critic (as the jacket describes him) the book abounds with interesting tidbits such as this, and almost persuades me I should read another Murdoch book!  I found this book a great reading experience.	2003-07-29

There is a lot of melodrama, and the Indians are portrayed with some balance.  There are some racist-like views, and a silly scene where Hector, a slave, begs his good master not to set him free.  But the account is fast-moving and event follows rapidly on event.  The scene is 1715 in South Carolina, and involves an Indian insurrection which actually happened, tho it is pretty hard to find much about it in history sources. Some of the speeches put in the mouths of characters in the extremely stressful situations in which they find themselves are not without humor to today's reader.  It is said this is the best of Simms' novels, and knowing that makes me think some of his other novels might be fun to read--this one is.	2003-07-21

Kennedy, 1917-1963	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Balanced and readable	This book has sensational words on Kennedy's health, and does not hesitate to say bad things about JFK.  But Dallek also has good things to say.  I found the book easy to read and I think it is probably the best balanced biography of Kennedy that has been written so far.  Its account of the Cuban missile crisis is chilling, and shows we all owe JFK a big debt of gratitude for his avoidance of nuclear war in that time of great danger. There are some mistakes in the book and I will note those I noticed, which can be corrected in the next printing:  On page 188 LBJ is referred to as majority leader in 1954, but he did not become majority leader till 1955.  On page 236 it is stated that in the 1958 elections the Democrats made a 28-seat gain in the Senate, which of course is false.  It was a gain of about 12 seats.  On page 267 Dallek says Bryan in 1908 chose an 84-year-old man as his vice-presidential rnnning mate, but Bryan's running mate in 1908 was John Worth Kern, age 59.  On page 269 Dallek says Symington was too young to be acceptable as JFK's vice-presidential candidate in 1960!  Symington was 59, older than the two men (Nixon and Lodge) on the 1960 Republican ticket.	2003-07-12

This is an excellent work, well matching the other D'Este works I have read: Decision in Normandy (read 5 July 1992) and Fatal Decision (read 29 June 2003).  Patton did heroic things but there is no need to admire his flaws--and that includes his belief that crude and foul language somehow made him a better man and general, and that he thought he knew more about mental damage than doctors.  But this is a great and enjoyable book to read and I revelled in it.	2003-07-07

The author has good things to say for Prohibition, and pooh-poohs the notion that Prohibition increased drinking--it clearly did not--or that crime increased because of it.  Obviously, however, Prohibition decreased resopect for law.  The author points out the same thing can be said for drug laws--and there is merit in what he says.  Since I so strongly believe in illegalization of harmful drugs I presume that if I had been an adult in 1915 I might have been for Prohibition!	2003-06-13

I myself decided to read this book because it won the Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for General Non-fiction.  I was surprised to see all the heat about the Armenian massacre, since I never previously realized that there was a school of thought which says it did not happen.  I read The Forty Days of Musa Dagh, by Franz Werfel, finsihing it on Jan. 2, 1944, and have ever since accepted as factual the events which served as the basis of that book.  I was and am willing to read an objective book on the Armenian massacre if there is such.  All the heat displayed by the pro-Turkish reviewers of this book would have been better expended by their telling us exactly what objective scholarly work should be read to show that the facts are other than as Ms. Power depicts them in this book. (I would have e-mailed such reviewers directly and asked, but most of them are anonymous.  If any read this, I am not anonymous and can be e-mailed and I invite them to do so.)  I myself thought the book had a lot of things which deserve study and attention.  Sure, there are atrocious massacres which the author does not discuss:  Stalin, the Red Chinese, and I gather East Timor.  Whether they fit into the definition of genocide is a question:  obviously the Communist crimes were aimed at a group, but the Genocide Convention talks about \\"a national, ethnical, racial or religious\\" group and the kulaks and Mao's victims may not fit that categorization (is that why Communist Russia so readily ratified the Convention?).  But the book is almost 600 pages now, and if every atrocity approaching genocide were included the book would be even longer.  So I submit the book is full of information and much of it makes sense, though it is ironic that the current president has given as a reason for war events in the 1980s when Saddam gassed \\"his own people\\".  If we can go to war over past genocide any time we feel like it, then our reasons for war at the time of our choosing  will be greatly expanded.  While one need not agree with everything Ms. Powers says, I think that what she says deserves thoughtful consideration.  I am glad I read this book.	2003-06-13

I think the points that Lamb makes about the men who fought in Vietnam are informative and little known--drug use in Vietnam was about the same as in the U.S at the time, the suicide rate was similar, the honorable discharge rate the same as before the war, etc.  The account of men who returned to Vietnam to visit is full of poignancy.  I thought this was a moving and thoughtful and poignant book, and much more attention-holding than I expected.  No bibliography, though.	2003-06-09

Books	5	13	15	N	N	The authoritative biography	First of all, this book is NOT by Edwin M. Stanton, who died in 1869.  The authors are Benjamin P. Thomas, the distinguished historian who was also the author of Abraham Lincoln: A Biography, which I read with great appreciation on 22 Jan 1993 and which was published in 1952 and which is generally considered the best one-volume biography of Lincoln at least until David Donald's superlative biography of Lincoln (read by me Feb 4, 1996) came along in 1995 and Harold M. Hyman, the co-author of Equal Justice Under Law: Constitutional Development 1835-1875 (read by me with much approval on 10 July 1982).  I found Stanton a good book, tho some of the parts, where the Civil War and the problems with finding a general are reviewed, did not happen to excite me.  But there can be little doubt that Stanton did yeoman service during the War and that he played a big role in the North's successful effort.  The dramatic events during the dispute between Andrew Johnson and the Radical Republicans in 1866-1868 are detailed well in this book, though very laudatory to Stanton.  While I agree with much of the viewpoint of the Radical Republicans I have never felt that the impeachment effort should have succeeded, and I thought the biography of Andrew Johnson by Hans L. Trefousse (which I greatly enjoyed when I read it 31 July 1999)reinforced that feeling for me--and Trefousse is certainly no apologist for the forces against the Radical Republicans.  In fact, the course Stanton pursued during the impeachment fight, when he refused to obey the orders of the president of the United States, his commander-in-chief, grate on one accustomed to the current view of presidential power.  The book is well-footnoted, with the footnotes where they belong (at the bottom of each page, so one can see whether they need to be read or whether they are merely source notes), but there is, sadly, no bibliography.  But as far as I know this is the best biography of Stanton, a man of great interest to any student of the 1860s.	2003-05-28

But it is not nearly as &quot;popular&quot; a work as Freedom from Fear.  Two or three chapters are hard to get interested in, I thought.  He does talk about the AEF's time in Europe, and seems much more deprecating toward it than is usual from American authors.  For instance, The Defeat of Imperial Germany 1917-1918 by Rod Paschall, while it may over-emphasize the role of the AEF, is, I think a needed corrective to Kennedy's down-playing of the American role in World War One.<BR>As the books Kennedy relies on have made clear (e.g., Opponents of War 1917-1918, by H. C. Peterson and Gilbert C. Fite), the record of the Wilson Administration in the field of civil liberties in wartime to a present-day viewer is sobering, the legal system seemingly surrendering to the war hysteria (as some today seem to again urge it do).  The book also has an insightful discussion of the contrast between American writing about the war compared to the more pessimistic view of men who were more sated by their longer involvment in the hell which was the Western front.  Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of interesting stuff in this book--it is just that some chapters may not be overly exciting to a non-economist, for instance.	2003-05-19

If you have not read that book, by all means read this one first, then read it.  This book is an account of a not extraordinary boyhood, but it is told in a poignant, if a bit mocking, way.  When I finished it, I found myself much impressed by the way he told the story.  It maybe helped that Hynes is only a few years older than I am, and that his account of a single summer doing farm work in Minnesota was filled with things I remember from my youth on an Iowa farm.  It was another world and a time now irretrievably past, and I think this is an elegantly told growing up story I enjoyed as much as I did Russell Baker's memorable classic (Growing Up, read 11 Apr 1986) and Jimmy Carter's An Hour Before Daylight (read 11 Mar 2001).	2003-05-14

This book is just as good.  This is not academic history, but Klingaman weaves from other books and contemporary sources an account of the time from Election Day in 1928 till mid-1930, and does a superlative job.  He does not tell what happens in the future but tells the events as they unfold.  The only way that the future is involved is in the selection of the events to be related.  And he does not discuss only the stock market, but brings in things such as the St. Valentine's Day massacre on Feb 14, 1929, and the events when Hoover was inaugurated--supposedly Hoover and Coolidge as they rode to the Inauguration said not a word to each other!  The book is just filled with interesting items of information.  One wonders how different it would be written after the bubble burst of 2000-2001.  I have read at least two other books on the Crash of 1929 (The Day America Crashed, by Tom Schactman--read 3 July 1979--and The Day the Bubble Burst, by Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan-Witts--read 25 Mar 2000)and this book is a better book than either of those.	2003-05-02

For somebody who does not want to spend weeks reading, this great book covers the topic most lucidly and can be read in a few hours.  It is true that it is now over 35 years since it was published, but for sound reasoning and clear exposition I think this book is hard to beat. A couple weeks ago I read L. C. F. Turner's Origins of the First World War, which came out in 1970 and while I enjoyed the reading I do believe this book, while only a little longer, does a better job explaining why Austria and Serbia are the principal ones to blame for the war, and that the murder at Sarajevo was a real cause of the war, not merely the occasion for it.	2003-04-29

The writing is a bit naive but one gets used to it and the story told catches one up.  It reminded me of a Helen MacInnes novel, with the big difference: this account is real!  It was published in 1943 and I understand was a selection of the Book of the Month Club.  There is good propaganda in the account, but that does not really detract from the story, and I found that the book was pageturny.

That being said, after the first hundred pages or so of this book the subject matter takes over and makes this a good read. There is no bibliography as such, but the footnoting is well done and much good comment on sources is found therein. I agree with other reviewers: anyone who can read this book and still claim that slavery was not THE reason for secession has a different reasoning process than I have. If one wants an easier more felicitous account of the road to the Civil War I would recommend the classic study by David M. Potter: The Impending Crisis 1848-1861. It of course covers more than this book. Do I understand correctly that Freehling's Volume II: Secessionists Triumphant, 1854-1861 has not yet been published?  I e-mailed the author and he advised that Volume II will be out shortly.  I will surely read it when I can, since the period it covers in our history is one of consuming interest to any devotee of US history.	2003-04-27

Ketchum, a really great book also.  But this book is mainly limited to 1941 and while it is mostly based on rather ordinary secondary sources, I found it a great book to read.  Most of the book discusses war, but other events are also covered:  Virginia Woolf's suicide, Whirlaway's triple crown, Joe DeMaggio's 56-game hitting streak, Ted Williams'.400 plus batting average, Mickey Owen's passed ball, etc.  Though I lived through all the time, I found the events on Yugoslavia, Greece, and Crete took on new clarity from my reading of this book.  While this is journalistic history, not academic history, I found the book a sheer joy.	2003-04-25

The essays are perceptive, tho some are repetitous.  The listing of all the Jewish Senators, Representatives, Federal judges, and governors is valuable.  I found it amazing that apparently there was no Jew appointed a Federal judge till Wilson appointed Brandeis to the Supreme Court in 1916 and then thereafter there was no Jew appointed to the Federal judiciary till Hoover appointed Cardozo to the Supreme Court in 1931, and not till FDR was any Jew appointed a lesser Federal judge! An excellent reference book.	2003-04-20

Catton tells a lot about lumbering, tho he himself had little to do with lumbering.  He graduated from Bezonia Academy in 1916, there being 11 in his class.  The Academy closed in 1918.  The book ends when Catton goes to college.  It is a pleasant book to read, since Catton is a fine writer.  But Jimmy Carter's book on his rural childhood I thought a more fetching read.	2003-04-14

And then on 31 July 1980 I read Fritz Fischer's bombshellic work, Germany's Aims in the First World War.  And on May 8, 1986 I finished reading Luigi Albertini's three-volume The Origins of the War 1914.  On Nov 14, 1992 I read John W. Langdon's July 1914: The Long Debate, 1918-1990.  The subject long has held my interest but not till now did I read Professor Turner's slim and highly readable study.  He disputes Fischer on a number of points, and it is neat that an Australian contests Fischer's indictment of Germany.  But as one reads one cannot but help but think how bitterly the July 1914 actors on the world stage must have regretted their then actions and inactions as the grim statistics of death and disaster mounted in the years after 1914--and all the world with them.  Though over 30 years old I found this work valuably insightful.	2003-04-11

If I had read it as the events of 1937-1939 were going on I would have understood those events much better.  The author is a great-granddaughter of Lloyd George, but it does not appear this has influenced her in any way I could detect.  Chapter by chapter this book illuminates the issues before the Peace Conference and explains what was done, how it was done, and some of the effects of the decisions and of the course of events after the decisions.  The chapters on the Middle East are most timely (tho Kuwait was not mentioned--apparently it was not a subject at Paris of the supplementary treaties).  There is scarcely a page in this clearly written book which does not tell interesting and important information.  And the book is well-footnoted, tho the footnote only gives the name of the author of the source, and to get the name of the book from which the information is drawn one needs to go from the footnote to the bibliography.  (Something I never heard of before: the author says the Founding Fathers considered adopting ancient Greek as the official language of the USA!) This is the best book I have ever seen on its subject and I think it is a great book.	2003-04-04

The book is of course too long, and there are stretches where it is dull, but there are many stretches herein with considerable interest. The Cloister and the Hearth, to which it has been compared, is a much better book. The same is true of The Three Musketeers. But the first part of the book is quite good, and the historical part involving Napoleon has its moments. But in general when Anthony gets to the USA the book becomes of less interest. The ending is long drawn out, and one reads just to see how it will come out. Hard to believe the book was the no. 1 bestseller in fiction in both 1933 and 1934. I wonder if anyone has ever read it twice. I certainly won't.	2003-03-31

Yet I feel I must, since I was so astounded by how this book grabbed me.  It is a book of interrelated short stories, some very short indeed, but I found I did not want to come to the last page.  While it is an entirely different book from another Vietnam-related book of short stories, A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain--a book I read with great enthusiasm on Jan 15, 1994--I think this book in its way is just as compelling a book as that one is.  Not every stories herein is laid in Vietnam.  One of the best of the 22 stories is \\"On the Rainy River\\" in which the author tells how he decided to go to Vietnam instead of Canada--a story which I am presuming is factual, as I can't help but think most of the stories are, even tho the book is labelled fiction.  Since there are so many reviews, obviously this book is a classic and is being assigned in classes.  It deserves to be read, and I am surprised I did not read it before this.	2003-03-26

It is meticulously researched and footnoted, and there is a comprehensive bibliography.  The viewpoint of the author is not pro-secessionist, albeit he tells us he lives in Richmond.  This book literally allows one to live the last days of Confederate Richmond with the people who were there, and I found this was an experience well worth the time spent reading the book.  It is a good supplementary companion to Jay Winik's April 1865: The Month that Saved America.	2003-03-24

This book does tell a lot about Blease and his connection with the mill workers of South Carolina, but I found even more interesting the account of the career of Olin D. Johnston. Those who only watched his career in the U.S. Senate, once he finally got there, on his third attempt, in 1945, may not (as I did not) realize the extraordinary positions he took while Governor from 1935 to 1939--he took over the highway department by force, defying a Supreme Court ruling--and that he ran in 1938 against Cotton Ed Smith on a platform of 100% support for FDR. The racist climate of South Carolina got to him, however, and not till he became more anti-Negro was he finally elected. The book also relates the fascinating account of Peter Richard Moody, a student at Wofford College, and the poem he wrote in 1936 which led the Legislature to order a mental examination of Moody, and the funny account of the result of the mental exam. The book traces the efforts and hopes of the disadvantaged millhands, and amply justifies the title of the work. Anyone interested in Southern politics should read this enlightening and well-researched book. The bibliography alone runs 30 pages, and I found the book unique in its subject. A minor note: a footnote on page 291 says poet Moody became a professor at the U.S. Military Academy, whereas it appears that actually he was at the Air Force Academy.	2003-03-23

Robinson had an interesting career, being elected to Congress in 1902, elected Governor of Arkansas in 1912, in 1913 elected by the Legislature to succeed Jeff Davis (who is the subject of a really outstanding biography: The Wild Ass of the Ozarks: Jeff Davis and the Wocial Basis of Southern Politics, by Raymond Arsenault), and served in the Senate till his sudden death on July 14, 1937, having been the vice-presidential candidate on Al Smith's ticket in 1928.  While the early chapters of this book, telling of Robinson's early years and his rise in Arkansas politics are interesting, the account of his Senate years is pedestrian and uninterestingly written.  The author has a superficial grasp of the times in which Robinson lived, and while the book is well-footnoted and has a good bibliography, the book is actually a published thesis and was a disappointment to me.  I have read a lot of senatorial biographies and must rate this one of the poorer ones.	2003-03-22

It is indeed a chilling account of the way things are in a country which accords to abortion a higher position than life, and the accounts of the way abortions are performed I don't suppose would be what pro-abotionists would like to read about. But I found the book educational and eye-opening.	2003-03-09

One's admiration for the super-human feats which Shackleton and his men performed and endured, capped by the events on South Georgia Island, make for a fantastically exciting and memorable read.  I doubt I will read as good a book again this year.  I can find nothing negative to say about this book and will look if there is anyone who gives this book less than five stars--after I post this.	2003-03-02

The others: Vicky (1840-1901); Alice (1843-1878); Helena (1846-1923); and Beatrice (1857-1944).  Between them they had 24 children--8, 8, 4 and 4, respectively.  One could say they did not really have happy lives, on balance.  This is an easy-to-read book tho maybe not of great significance.	2003-03-02

The author rightly points out that the Church furnished Joyce an excellent free education, and that it is in the nature of persons who feel inferior to lash out at that to which they owe gratitude.  Much that Joyce did in his private life was stupid, and one cannot admire much of his behavior.  The book also examines his work and gives a worthwhile summary of it.  The author confirms for me the wisdom of not trying to read Finnegan's Wake--it simply is not worth the effort which would be necessary to make any sense out of it.	2003-02-27

Board of Education as the good finale.  I would recommend that after reading this book one should read Simple Justice, by Richard Kluger, which tells the story of Brown v. Board of Education itself superlatively.  The title of this book is from a statement by William Faulkner heavy with prophetic insight:  &quot;We speak now against the day when our Southern people who will resist to the last these inevitable changes in social relations, will, when they have been forced to accept what they at one time might have accepted with dignity and goodwill, will say: 'Why didn't someone tell us this before?

I found this book inferior to Fatal Vision (which I read with much appreciation on 5 Jan 1985) and to Cruel Doubt (which I read 11 Nov 2002).  Many of the names of the people involved in this case have been changed.  One can get the actual names of the people, including the girlfriend, by reading the legal opinions concerning the case.  The conviction was affirmed in a 175-page opinion by the New Jersey Supreme Court in State v. Marshall, 586 A. 2nd 85 (1991).  The most recent decision in the case is Marshall v. Hendricks, 307 F. 3rd 36, decided Sept 11, 2002, which ordered a further hearing in regard to effectiveness of counsel in the penalty phase of the trial, which readers will remember was handled somewhat lackadaisically according to the book.  The book spends a lot of time repeating the whining of the murderer, which surely grew old and tiresome.  I think the book deviated too much from the truth and made up a lot of stuff and I prefer true crime accounts to be as accurate and factual as possible.  This one flunks the veracity test.	2003-02-24

One of the BVM sisters who was at the school at the time and who suffered burns and scars therefrom subsequently taught some of my kids. But the account, the heart-breaking account, of the events leading up to and surrounding the awesome event I found a wrenching and saddening read.  This book is well-done; I was pleased to see  two pages whereon all the dead are listed by name and age.  I would have welcomed a listing of the injured and of the ones who were there but were saved.  One cannot but be thankful that apparently there were about a thousand children who escaped physical harm, though the book fails to mention the number--which I would have appreciated it doing.  As tragedy books go, this one is one I am glad I found and read.	2003-02-23

After reading this book it might be wise to read Roy Jenkins' superb biography of Asquith. While I did not think this was as exciting a book as Jenkins' biography of Asquith, that is due only to the times that each was Prime Minister--Asquith's time was far more momentous.  But I enjoyed this book thoroughly.  One cannot but help admiring Campbell-Bannerman, even he was not a very hard worker.  He customarily spent six weeks each fall at Marienbad.  He was rather against the Boer War, and when he came to power he made peace with Botha and Smuts, to Lord Milner's disgust.  The book has an excellent bibliography, listing books which I would like to read.  When I read this book I noted from said bibliography three books to read:  Arthur James Balfour, by Blanche Dugdale; 25 Years, by Viscount Grey, and Haldane, 1856-1915, by Maj. Gen. Sir Frederick Maurice.  But since I have only read 25 Years.  The other two remain on my to be read list.	2003-02-17

I love that Scarisbrick has modernized the spelling and punctuation of the original documents he quotes.  I think the picture of Henry presented is well-balanced, and does not minimize the faults of the subject of the biography.  The careful examination of the question of the validity of the marriage of Henry and Catherine of Aragon is the best I have ever read, and partisans on either side of that question will see that there is indeed another side to the view they favor.  The examination of the religious views of Henry is detailed and enlightening.  I have always had a negative view of Henry VIII and I still have after reading this book, but the book was instructive and enlightening.  The footnotes are where they belong (at the bottom of each page) and the bibliography is detailed though of course a bit dated in the 1968 edition I read.  After you read this book you will know that you have read a really good biography of this important figure in world history.	2003-02-16

Smith: The Happy Warrior	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Absorbingly interesting and well-done	Though I only a year ago, on Feb. 2, 2002, read Robert Slayton's biography of Al Smith, I have now read this work and find it just as well done, and in some respects better than Slayton's book. This study seemed to concentrate on the things about Smith's life which are of abiding interest, and dwelt less on minutiae of New York local public affairs no longer of interest or concern.  The account of the absorbingly interesting political efforts aimed at the presidency which were pursued in the 1920s are told with verve and clarity.  Especially well-done is the account of how the fierce but unsuccessful bid in 1924 for the Democratic nomination turned into the cakewalk to that nomination in 1928.  The account of the 1928 campaign is also well told, and one, in hindsight, is amazed by the confident optimism existent in the Smith camp till election day in 1928, in those innocent pre-scientific polling days!  Finan also tells the story of the relationship with FDR in the years from 1928 to 1932 with a somewhat different take, showing that what so offended Smith was actually a tactic deemed helpful to FDR's drive for the 1932 nomination.  The sad story of the Liberty League connection and the January 1936 &quot;walk&quot; is covered with insight, and what I felt was the appropriate outlook.  While the bibliography is a bit thin, and the notes could also have been fuller, this does not detract from the readability of the book.  I found few errors, and those minor:  on page 203 Senator Marcus Coolidge of Massachusetts is referred to as a Republican, whereas he was in fact a Democrat; on page 255 the implication is that Senator Tom Heflin of Alabama was defeated on Nov. 4, 1930, but his loss came in the Democratic primary much earlier in the year.  Anyone who revels in political history of absorbing interest will enjoy this excellent book.  I did.	2003-02-10

My realistic soul simply could not accept that even one in the central character's mental condition could do and effectuate what she is related to have done and accomplished.  Possibly one should suspend one's view of reality when reading another's fictional creation, but I never was one much for fantasy and anyway this does not, at least overtly, purport to be fantasy.  Nor could I applaud the ending.  But I am not one to judge a book of this genre.  I kept wondering whether this is supposed to be a Harlequin-type book (I've never read such so...), or &quot;young adult&quot;?  But I guess it is classified as a psychological thriller, but evidence of psychological veracity if present was not noticed by me.  But I am no psychologist.  I felt reading this book was not a valuable use of  my time.	2003-02-09

The one I read was printed in 1907 by The Roycrofters Shop in East Aurora, N.Y. and was translated by Lascelles Wraxall.  But if this is the same work, it is a very readable book, full of the elan and verve one expects from Victor Hugo.  After reading it one can see why Wellington said Waterloo was &quot;a very near run thing.&quot;  The picture Hugo paints, complete with insightful observations made at the battlefield in 1861, is one well worth reading.

Many chapters were of high interest, though one is not sure how objective the author is.  It was annoying that there was not a single footnote, and that the bibliography did not list books alluded to in the text.  The chapter detailing how the Aboriginals were allegedly treated in this century and even into the 1960s was appalling to me, tho Australia seems to have put the worst of that attitude behind it, what with the decisive repudiation of the One Nation Party in the last few years. The author expresses some highly opinionated views on subjects with little effort to tell the other side of the subject, presuming there is one.

The author is an authority on the two dominating figures of those decades, Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt, and I read his dual study, The Warrior and the Priest: Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt, on October 7, 1995, with much appreciation.  Cooper writes in a clear style, and even tho this book read like a college textbook, hey, it is fun to read a college textbook on such interesting subjects as this book deals with.  A good and worthwhile book.	2003-01-23

I found his account of the struggles of his forbears in South Dakota poignant, his account of his time in Bristol, Igloo, Ravinia, Pickstown, and Yankton full of interest.  If you liked Russell Baker's Growing Up (which won a Pulitzer Prize) I think you will also like this book, even tho it might not win a Pulitzer.  You can read this in a few hours, and when you are finished I bet you will have warm and friendly feeling about the author. I surely did.	2003-01-19

It throws light on the endlessly absorbing question: How could Hitler take over the country so completely as he did. I found absorbing the account of the child growing up during the first World War, living thru the inflation of 1923, attaining manhood in the 1920s, and then all at once the ridiculous Nazis are in power and the nightmare begins. This is a well-told account, and of great insight.	2003-01-14

The pictures do it--the text is not by a person with an Iowa farm background, and, I am sorry to say, it shows. For instance on page 79 she talks of tying bales by hand.  Maybe some people did such but I never heard of it--if one had no baler the hay was put up loose into a haymow, though I suppose there may have been balers which did not tie the bales even as in the far distant past there were binders which did not tie the bundles.  Her discussion on threshing overlooks entirely a great tradition in I think most threshing rings: the afternoon lunch and often also the morning lunch.  Minced ham sandwiches or hot dogs never tasted so good!  But you cannot quarrel with what the pictures actually show, whether they correspond with one's own experience or not we know thay are authentic and effectively recall a time now gone.  Do yourself a favor and get this book.  You will savor it.	2003-01-06

They are of uneven quality, but some are great reading.  I especially liked the excerpts from letters written in 1936 by a mother to her daughter, which related the horrendous challenge which living thru that fabulous winter in Iowa was.  There is also a good to read account by a railroadman telling of his work from 1911 to 1956--I thought his upbeat attitude to his hard work made a great account.  Some of the accounts were a bit hard to believe, and one suspects some of the accounts are a bit embellished, but maybe not.	2002-12-29

I was surprised how I was moved by it, tho he is a generation before me.  Some of the farming practices he describes (such as threshing from stacks) I only heard about, but others were not too different from when I was a boy in a different part of Iowa.  Any one who grew up on a farm or has rural roots will be affected by this book, maybe not as powerfully as was I but it is a very pleasant book to read.  The author's few poems (which were published in papers at times) are in the book, and they while not great poetry have a charm which surprises.  This volume is a worthy component of Iowa State University Press' Iowa Heritage Collection.	2002-12-26

The author says he did lots of research but he carefully declines to give authority for what he says in the book and it is really frustrating since it is clear that at times he exaggerates or is slipshoddy with the story.  He tries to make the fantastic story of this gross swindle which led so many dupes to part with their money read like a novel, whereas he would have been far better advised to footnote his assertions and cite where his authority is.  He apparently unearthed the trial transcript and why he doesn't tell us where it can be checked I do not know, since he just skims the trial rather than explaining it.  The lawyer for Hartzell, Carlos Goltz, is a legend in these parts and still invokes comment, tho he has been dead over 50 years.  His role in the trial is not well told.  I thought it odd for the author to tell how he himself was a crook at one time and that this led him to be interested in Hartzell.  One need not be a crook to be interested in this amazing story and I only wish it were better and more carefully told.  I really enjoyed reading the account, but it could have a so much better book.  To get a flavor for the trial read the opinion, Hartzell v. U.S., 72 F.2d 569 (CCA 8, 1934).  It will make you want to read this book, even tho the book is not as well-composed as it should be.	2002-12-21

The last chapter tho makes a person feel better and I am glad the author spent some time finding out what happened to the people involved in the tumultous events of October, 1962.  How pleasant to know that the student body president, the newspaper editor, the quarterback, and the head basketball coach in 2000-2001 were all African-American, and how stupid the rioters must feel now about the views they had in 1962. This is a popular account but it is great reading.	2002-12-19

The authors have done a lot of research and their telling of the dramatic life and feats of Wiley Post makes for a fascinating book.  The account of the two round-the-world flights is full of awesome momnets.  There is a lot of technical flying data, and for the non-flyer this gets a bit long, as does the exhaustive account of the events following the crash on Aug 15, 1935.  From the time that Wiley Post dies there are still 120 pages in the book, but much is interesting and the account of the world-wide grieving is poignant and well-done.  There are good illustrations, tho also I would have liked a map of the the area where the crash occurred.  But overall, this book tells  the story well, and is well worth reading if you are interested in the life of a daring and gutsy early flyer, who should be remembered.	2002-12-08

He was an interesting and great man, and this biography tells his life story withunderstanding if not with too much verve.  What saves the book is that it is so filled with interesting facts, some of which were new to me.  Lyndon Johnson was a big buddy of Rayburn's, as Caro's Master of the Senate makes clear, but the more or less incidental account of Johnson's achievement in getting the 1957 Civil Rights Bill thru the Senate, which is hailed and studied in such detail in Caro's book, is given an entirely different slant in this work, much less flattering to Johnson than is the account in Master of the Senate.  This book is adequately footnoted, and the sources are often indicative of the work that the author went to to get the book right, and there is a good bibliography.  I had a good feeling when I finished this book that it does Sam Rayburn justice.	2002-12-07

It is also a fascinating book, telling of the history of what I call the British Isles.  (The book spends a bit of time discussing what they should be called.) The book is excellent, tho the history before 1066 does not interest me much.  He concludes that Britain will disintegrate into four nations.  The appendices are most interesting and varied.  Never before had I seen a list of the 57 living persons bypassed to make George I king.  One even can find the words and music for Danny Boy!  This book is a treat to read and own.	2002-12-06

The author concludes that biological evolution is solidly probable, but is more wary about cosmic evolution and evolution from non-life to life.  Well-footnoted and all in all I thought an excellent treatment.  The book shows that evolution, far from excluding a Supreme Being, argues to the existence of God and His continued governance.  The author formulates it this way:<BR>Contrary and discordant things cannot, always or in most cases, be parts of one order except under someone's government, which enables all and each to tend to a definite end.<BR>However, in the progress of evolutionary prehistory, and continuing in the present we find that things of diverse natures and processes come together and correlate under one order, and this not rarely or by chance but always or for the most part.<BR>Therefore, there must be some being by whose providence the world is governed.  This being we call God.	2002-12-05

It is written by a National Catholic Reporter correspondent, but the NCR bias is not too overt.  He lists 20 Cardinals who he says are the group of which one will be the next Pope.  But instead of listing them in the order of probability he lists them alphabetically!  One of the 20 is already dead (Cardinal Nguyen Van Thuan), another has turned 80 (Cardinal Etchegaray) and will not even be in the next conclave. He does include in his list of front-runners Dionigi Tettamanzi, Cardinal Archbishop of Genoa, who for some time now has been my prediction for next Pope.  Most of the book is pretty accurate as far as I can tell, tho I did note that on Page 119 he describes Pope Paul V as &quot;the Borgia Pope,&quot; which is incorrect, he being from the Borghese family--not from the Borgia family.  A little older book which deals interestingly with the same topic is Passing the Keys: Modern Cardinals, Conclaves, and the Election of the Next Pope, by Francis A. Burkle-Young.  That authority listed five papabili, but only three of those five are in Allen's top 20.  Cardinal Neves is omitted because of his health problems, and Cardinal Piovanelli I presume because he is already 78--and the conclave is not imminent. This is an absobing book, as was The Inner Elite: Dossiers of papal Candidates, by Gary MacEoin and his committee, which I read 25 Aug 1978 and after reading which I predicted that Albino Luciani would be elected--and he was.  But then when he died I predicted Sebastiano Baggio--and we all know that he wasn't elected.  You should read this book and then see if you can predict the next Pope when the time comes for him to be elcted.	2002-12-01

As I read along its sometimes insipid prose I said to myself:  why do I keep reading?  There was only one answer:  I seldom fail to finish a book I start.  But about the time that Charlotte goes back to Europe this book became exciting to read and began telling me things I had not remembered about the the story from when I read, back in the summer of 1945, Phantom Crown: The Story of Maximilian &amp; Carlota of Mexico, by Bertita Harding, a novel-like telling of the story which really caught me up in those halycon days of my youth.  Of course, one would like to know the truth and the source about things like Charlotte's bizarre crashing into the residence of Pope Pius IX, but it must be more or less accurate, can we not think?  This is a defective book, but anyone interested in 19th century royalty cannot help but be a bit attracted to what it has to say.  Who is Prince George of Greece, does someone know?  He could at least have told us who his ancestors were, I would think.	2002-11-28

It is less &quot;down&quot; on Naploeon than is Schom's book, tho there is plenty to dislike Napoleon for even if one is not universally condemnatory of him. I only gave this book four stars because there are no footnotes, though there are about fifty pages of &quot;sources&quot; listed.  But there is no way to check where McLynn gets any of statements from, and that is not a good thing.  But if that does not bother you you will enjoy this account of the fantastic career of its subject.	2002-11-24

But since I wasn't sure I had anything to add to the 21 existing reviews, I read them before deciding to do one myself.  I certainly did not find this book as unputdownable as I did David Garrow's Carrying the Cross (read by me 16 Jan 1989)or Taylor Branch's Parting the Waters (read 15 Dec 1994) and Pillar of Fire (read 31 Jan 1999).  And Ms. McWhorter does have a tortuous style, well illustrated by the sentence quoted by one of the reviewers.  The page notes in the back of the book, 70 pages of them!) are in such small print that without a magnifying glass it is a real strain to read them.  I can see why Birmingham folk will be particularly interested in the book, but many of the numerous names are meaningless to others, and do not make the reading of this book easier.  There is much appalling recorded in the book, and much thought-provoking.  One cannot help but wonder what would I have done living in the climate of Birmingham in 1963?  Would I have had the backbone, the willingness to be ostracized and possibly injured in property if not in person, and done the right thing?  It is very easy for us in the North to cluck and condemn the attitudes of whites in Birmingham of that day, but I wonder what we would have done in that time calling for heroic behavior if one was to stand for justice and right?  How public would we have been against the evil then permeating white Birmingham?	2002-11-17

This book is just as good, and I found that I kept wanting to get back to reading it.  It is very well-done, and a lawyer can read it without cringing, since the author handles the legal issues--fascinating ones so far as attorny-client relations go--intelligently.  Anyone reading the book will want to read the opinion of the North Carolina Supreme Court which is State v. Upchurch, 421 S.E. 2d 577  (N.C. 1992).  The book does not cover the retrial and I have found out how the retrial came out, but to tell you might be in the nature of a spoiler, so I won't.	2002-11-12

Kienzle.  But this book was mentioned to me with some awe and I decided I would see whether the author has become a better writer since The Rosary Murders, which was his first published endeavor.  I am sorry to report that there  has been no improvement in the writing. The author's plot is even more incredible, and the denouement has the villianous bishop revealed to have done something which a man with his supposed characteristics could not psychologically have done, and the author's feeble attempt to relate it to the principle of double effect, one intended, the other permitted, fails entirely.  The author has an agenda, apparently, to show that the established Church needs to think like the author and do what the author thinks it should do.  He has a perfect right to pursue that agenda but I hope his readers (I don't expect to read another of his books) read him knowledgeably and not think of him as an unbiased witness informing them of Church beliefs and practices objectively.	2002-10-29

The author of this book used to be a priest and thus knows a lot about the inner workings of the Church in Detroit, but is obviously disgruntled and estranged.  His hero in the book is what he would that he would be if he were still in good standing in the Church.  Frankly, I found the writing amateurish, the plot silly and incredible.  The book has lots of gore and everything about the book is unsubtle and heavy-handed and I suppose that is why it is published by a publisher few have ever heard of rather than a major publisher.	2002-10-29

This is the eighth Hassler book I have read, and while it is different from some of his others, there is so much funny in the book my wife told me to go to another room to read since I was helplessly laughing aloud so very often.  There is nothing theological about this book, and in fact nothing judgmental (I thought there could have been at least some indication of non-approval of the adultery), but nevertheless one can't help but be caught up in the zany story.

I cannot see how anyone could enjoy reading this awful book.  The story it tells is really inane, I thought, tho I know one should make allowances for the period in which it was written.  But we all know Dickens wrote in the same time period and his works still enthrall readers.  I cannot imagine anyone being enthralled by this work.  It does not help that Kingsley for entirely gratuituous reasons periodically snarls at what he calls &quot;papists&quot; with obvious bigotry. Towards the end there is a long chapter devoted to telling of a dream Alton Locke had, which I only was able to keep reading because I was determined to finish the book, since I seldom quit reading a book once I have decided, wisely or unwisely, to read it.  Unless you are going to write a thesis or something on Kingsley you will be glad you did not decide to read this book.	2002-10-26

The Fountain is laid during World War One, in Holland, and concerns an English officer interned there and the English wife of a German officer.  The book does considerable philosophizing and the first two-thirds of the book really drug as far as I was concerned.  The book picks up in interest after that, but I cannot say I was greatly interested in the prime characters and their excuses for adultery.	2002-10-22

This account is slipshoddily written by a journalist, not by a historian.  The book has no footnotes and no real bibliography.  So much of the account is devoted to guessing and while the book is rightly sympathetic to the black victims the account often lapses into juvenilistic maudlin journalism.  The story is important, the event is full of horrific atrocities by white people, but the telling is not done well.  Instead of expatiating on how awful things were I would far rather the author had laid out the facts, complete with footnotes.  ...I simply have no faith that this account is objective and accurate.

Since most of the Hawthornden prizewinners I have read (only 9 so far) have been good reading, I decided to read this.  On balance it tells an interesting story and holds one's attention well.  It is laid in Ireland of the 1870s and concerns an upper-class Irish Catholic family, the &quot;proper&quot; members of which are portrayed in a somewhat unfavorable light.  The &quot;rebel&quot; members of the family get most of the attention in the book, as I suppose one would expect in a novel.  I do not regret reading the book, and would read more by Kate O'Brien if I ran across such.	2002-10-06

But I found as I read that it is a tour de force and much is of high drama, taking one into the grunt world that Laurence lived in as a TV journalist (CBS) where the viewpoint is quite different from that of a print journalist.  While Meo, the cat the book is named for, occupies only about 50 pages of the book, those pages are a delight to read, even tho one figures Laurence is exaggerating a bit in describing the tough cat which he found in Hue and his behavior.  This book is powerful and is rightly ranked with Dispatches, by Michael Herr, which I read with appreciation on July 6, 1999, as a great Vietnam book.  However the best book still that I have read on the war in Vietnam is We Were Soldiers Once...And Young, by Harold G. Moore and Joe Galloway.

This is an exceptionally well-done account, not only of the Six Day War itself, but of the events leading up to it, and some on the events after it up to now.  Sometimes books about war get dull even in reciting exciting events, because they spend lots of time relating minutiae about individual units, or read as if they were designed to help wargamers plot the events or help people learn about their relatives' role in the war.  This book avoids that, and I can honestly say there is not a single dull page in the book.  The maps are helpful, tho for us older folk a magnifying glass is helpful.  The book is exhaustively footnoted, but the footnotes are unintrusive and need not be consulted unless the reader wants to get the source for the statements.  (So often the footnotes in a book contain interesting material which makes it necessary to check each one--even tho many are just giving a source.)  And the book truly is even-handed, free from the type of applause which Stephen Ambrose for instance lards his books with.  Particularly I liked the fact that the diplomatic and political events of the war are covered right along with the military--in other words, the interplay of the military events and the political and diplomatic events are given not in separate chapters but right where the reader wants to know them.  I read Colonel Trevor Dupuy's book, Elusive Victory: The Arab-Israeli Wars, 1947-1974, and found it, tho it dealt with such momentous events, a bore to read unless one was enthralled by the technical military spects of war.  This book contains so much which was enlightening to me, including a balanced and convincing account concerning the attack on the US ship Liberty, which till I read this book I could not understand but which is explained in a believable way.  This is the best book about war that I have read since I read With the Old Breed, by E. B.Sledge back in March of 2001.  And that is saying a lot since I have read some great books concerning war during that time, including April 1865: The Month That Saved America, by Jay Winik, and Eye-Deep in Hell, by John Ellis.  Six Days of War is a must-read for anyone interested in the Middle East today--and are we not all?	2002-09-16

Some of the account, when not much was going on in Phillipines (where the Delilah was), were not overly exciting, but the book in its last 70 pages or so is unputdownable.

Rather than read this book, I suggest you read The Defeat of Imperial Germany 1917-1918, by Rod Paschall.  I found it a much better book, still resonating in my memory over ten years after I finished reading it on 6 April 1991.  Unless you are really interested in the various units fighting, the account of those units' various actions and inactions is a drag for one who had no relative in the AEF or is not a wargamer.  Incidentally, on page 10 Eisenhower says that on April 6, 1917 the USA was at war with Imperial Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  But I find that the USA did not declare war on Austia-Hungary until Dec 7, 1917.  I am curious as to why war was declared on that country at that particular time, and would like to know more about the reason for that particular timing.  Since Eisenhower thinks we declared war on Austria-Hungary on Apr 6, you won't find anything about it in this book	2002-08-21

The book shows Verot was a character, as the author says in the best sense of the word.  One does not get the idea that he was episcopal timber from reading about his career as a teacher in Maryland, but from Apr 25, 1858, (when Archbishop Kenrick consecrated him as Vicar Apostolic of Florida) on, one cannot but be impressed with the self-sacrificing and devoted way he performed his arduous tasks.  Putting up with what he did must have been what enabled him to play such a tough and outspoken role at the first Vatican Council, where, inter alia, he called for the rehabilitation of Galileo--which was finally accomplished during this pontificate.  His discourses at the Council, which seem to have been quite numerous and frank, cannot have been very persuasive but contained a lot of common sense.  One wonders how he could fail to be cowed by the scene, being, as he was, a very minor bishop from a poor diocese.  It was during the Council that he was appointed Bishop of St. Augustine.  This is great work on a great bishop.	2002-08-21

I found myself much caught up by this very personal and absorbingly interesting account of living in wartime Germany.  Conditions seemed to get worse after the war ended, altho then at least the bombing was over.  It is a much less detailed account than Victor Klemperer gives in the second volume of his I Will Bear Witness, also an account of life in wartime Germany, but that is told from the perspective of a Protestant of Jewish ancestry, whereas this book has no didactic purpose--it is just made up of letters composed periodically by a mother to her children.  But I found this unpretentious book absorbing in a way different from the Klemperer volumes.  I cannot recommend it too highly for one interested in the experience of Germans while the war was going on.	2002-08-21

But it tells his story well, and shows that up thru 1928 Al Smith was a progressive and able statesman.  After 1932 the author admits that he appeared to have lost his empathy for the people he had done so much for. There are poignant passages in the book, including the account of the funeral in 1944, according to this book attended by 200,000 people--which seems hard to believe. If you want a more thorough study of the subject, I recommend Empire Statesman: The Rise and Redemption of Al Smith, by Robert A. Slayton.	2002-08-12

I found it enjoyable to read and rather moving.  Wilson was an interesting and odd person, and this book accurately shows that after his stroke in 1919 he was no longer the brilliant person he was before that calamity.  Edith lived on till Dec. 28, 1961, which date was the 105th anniversary of Woodrow Wilson's birth. I found this book a satisfying and attention-holding book, tho it is does not pretend to be scholarly.	2002-08-10

I have since read his biography of Charles Dilke (read Oct 19, 1974) and of Gladstone (read Apr 19, 1997), as well as his great work on the battle over the House of Lords in 1910 called Mr. Balfour's Poodle: People vs. Peers (read Jan. 13, 1997).  While this biography relies mainly on secondary sources, it is a great telling of a fantastically interesting life, filled with interest from 1895 (when Churchill was in Cuba during the Cuban struggle for independence) till his death in 1965. 1940 is of course the highlight year of the life, but I found the years preceding that and the years after that equally attention-holding.  And if one had not run across before the words \\"resile\\" and \\"psephology\\" you will come to know them in this book--just an added benefit from reading it!

It is crammed with the author's beliefs, but those beliefs are deserving of attention, and many make a lot of sense.  I was disturbed by the lack of footnotes for many startling statements, and even when there are footnotes they often are unenlightening in regard to the statements footnoted.  Let me illustrate:  on page 248 he has a discussion of Red China, and includes the statement that 20 to 43 million lives were lost in Red China between 1959 and 1961.  There is no footnote in regard to the statement, and I for one would like a hint of the authority for this statement.  I presume the author figures his word should be accepted, but a lot of lesser itmes are footnoted, and it would be helpful if statements such as this were too.  On a pickier note, on page 165 Leebaert refers to \\"Colorado senator William Milliken\\" whereas those of us who observed the Senate in those days know his name was Eugene Millikin.  And It would be nice if there were a footnote for the assertion (page 109) that when Senator Borah died in 1940 his safety-deposit box contained $200,000 in cash--which the author suggests may have come from the Soviets!  Allen Weinstein in his book The Haunted Wood tells of Samuel Dickstein, who served in the House from 1923 to 1945, receiving the present-day equivalent of $200,000 from the Soviets, but $200,000 in 1940 would be well over a million dollars in today's money, so this is pretty sensational stuff, but Leebaert just throws this out and someone who wants to know more about it is given no help at all by so much as a footnote.  Stuff like that.  But the book is a fascinating read, nonetheless, and a lot of what he says may be right.	2002-07-28

It is I suppose mainly a reference book but I read it cover to cover in less than two days.  It includes a number of ratings of Presidents, and also ratings of Supreme Court Justices.  Each person nominated for the Supreme Court is described, together with a sketch of his (or her) work on the Court after confirmation.  Some may disagree with some of the judgments, but in general they resonate well.  This is a great book.  I noted a few errors and will list them, tho they are minor. On page 189 it is stated that &quot;the key slogan of Eisenhower's campaign in 1952&quot; was &quot;Had enough?&quot;  That was the Republican slogan in 1946.  The slogan in 1952 was a much milder one:  &quot;I Like Ike.&quot;  On page 345 footnote 14 lists the Senators who voted against Senator Hugo Black's confirmation as Justice of the Supreme Court, and names one of the six Democrats who voted against him as Burke (N.H.)  This is an error; Burke was a Senator from Nebraska, not from New Hampshire.  On page 364 footnoe 63 gives the citation for United States v. Eichman as 496 U.S. 310 at 4776.  This is an obvious error, since no opinion goes on from page 310 to page 4776.  I have not checked the page number of the language quoted, but it is not on page 4776 since no volume of the U.S. Reports has that many pages.  But these minor errors do not mean the book is poorly edited.  In general the editing is quite good.  This is a book that any person interested in the Court should own.	2002-07-22

It took some getting into, and I found it helpful to read  encyclopedia entries on Hadrian, making this fictional (but solidly based on the known facts) memoir much more interesting.  The prose is liquid and evocative, and grows on one as one reads.  The pagan morality of Hadrian offends, but as Roman emperors go he was a success.  By the time I finished reading this, I was interested in doing more reading in Roman history.  I think this book may be better-done than Robert Graves' I, Claudius (read in the spring of 1959 by me) and his Claudius the God (read 26 May 1981).	2002-07-21

The research seemed very good, and includes data from German sources which made the account especially informative.  The account from the time the torpedo is launched till the ship goes down I found riveting and searing.  I thought the account exceptionally informative and the writing well-done.

Puller, Jr., and (the best of all) We Were Soldiers Once... And Young, by Harold G Moore and Joseph Galloway.  The book is episodic, and thus has no narrative line, which I would have preferred, but the accumulation of accounts is searing.  The account of his return home is horrific, and no matter what one thinks of the Vietnam War, for  him to have had to undergo what he relates is shocking and extremely anger-inducing, and I wish he had told us that he did to the persons who encountered him what he must have felt like doing.

It opens when the author was under 21, on Jan. 1, 1913, progresses thru that year and on into the war.  This is a wrenching book, vivid,super-poignant--written with great beauty.

The author takes up very interesting topics, such as, e.g., the expansion of the president's power in foreign affairs--powered by Justice Sutherland--and the \\"canonization\\" of Supreme Court Justices Holmes and Brandeis and  the \\"demonization\\" of Justices Van Devanter, Sutherland, Butler and McReynolds.  Some of his discussion was hard to follow.  He throws around terms like, for instance,  \\"essentialist.\\"  I guess my study of philosophy and jurisprudence is too far in the past and I wish he had done a better job explaining terms such as that.  I enjoyed about 75% of the book, and am now interested in any rejoinder to the book's claims that may have come out since it was published.	2002-06-16

The Green Flag: The Turbulent History of the Irish National Movement, by Robert Kee, was the best book I read in 1972, and The Parnell Tragedy, by Jules Abels, was the best book I read in 1974 (even tho it is not the best book on Parnell--F.S.L. Lyons' book, Charles Stewart Parnell, which I read 20 May 1979, is equally good and Robert Kee's The Laurel and the Ivy: The Story of Charles SAtewart Parnell and Irish Nationalism [which I read May 1, 1996] is better).  This novel by Thomas Flanagan is written with a most authentic-seeming Irish touch, and the story takes us through the Fenian and Parnell years with a better story line than The Year of the French, the first volume in the trilogy, had for its period, the rising of 1798. Anyone who likes to absorb history by reading fiction could scarcely do better than read this book as to late nineteenth century Irish history.	2002-06-10

We all know that Caro is a master at doing the opposite of what a photographer or painter might do to a subject:  Caro accentuates, underlines, and reiterates the flaws in Johnson, but in this volume much time is devoted to the 1957 Civil Rights bill which Johnson managed to get enacted, and so there are more good things for Caro to say about LBJ than in the earlier volumes.  The opening account of the Senate's history and the extended account of Richard Russell's life and career are digressions of great interest and are exceptionally well-done, and all in all I found this book one that held my attention and great interest to the very last page.  It probably will be the volume which has the most good things to say about LBJ.  The interest of the material for anyone who has followed politics makes five stars essential for this book, tho one might question some of the emphases that Caro puts on his material. But I suspect that the account of how Johnson got the civil rights bill of 1957 enacted cannot be improved upon. There are bound to be in a book this size some errors, and I noted a few that I will list so that they can be corrected in the next printing. On page 20, it is said that Webster's famed Seventh of March speech was given in 1849 instead of the correct year: 1850.  Page 64: Caro says in 1938 Howard Smith was the head of the House Rules committee, but he did not become the chairman of the Rules Committee until 1955!  Also on page 64, and later, Caro says every major domestic law proposed by FDR after the Supreme Court fight of 1937 was blocked, but the Wage-Hour Law certainly qualifies as major legislation, and it was enacted in 1938.  In a footnote on page 1075 Caro describes Elbert Thomas of Utah as a \\"firm southern ally\\" which anyone familiar with hiscareer would know is not true: he was a consistent New Deal supporter. Page 254: Charles Tobey is called a Democrat, but he was a Republican.  On page 96 Caro describes the Southern senators entering the Senate and has Cotten Ed Smith entering with Clyde R. Hoey, but Cotten Ed Smith died in 1944 and Hoey did not become a Senator till 1945 so they could not have entered the chamber together.  Page 361: It is stated that Robert Taft died just four months after accepting the post of Majority leader in January of 1953; but Taft died July 31, 1953, so it is more like six months than four.  Page 362:  \\"the arch-conservative William Langer of North Dakota\\" is a particularly inappropriate description of the rabidly isolationalist but radical Senator from North Dakota, often denominated as \\"Wild Bill.\\"  Page 375:  Brien McMahon is described as a Republican, which he of course was not.  Page 522 calls Welker of Idaho and Malone of Nevada \\"midwestern\\" allies of Taft, which is a new way to look at those states.  Page 562:  Senator Hayden did not become chairman of Appropriations \\"thanks to McKellar's death\\" but thanks to McKellar's defeat by Albert Gore, Sr. (in 1952).  Page 704 and page 776:  Clarence Diggs, Jr. is described as a Chicago Congressman but he was a Detroit Congressman.  Page 1055 names \\"William J. Fulbright\\" but his correct name is \\"J. William Fulbright.\\"  But these obvious errors are minor and do not mean the book is not carefully researched--even tho it would have been nice to have real footnotes instead of the difficult to follow source notes which the book has.	2002-05-28

This entrancing study relies on the personal letters of not only Fighting Bob LaFollette and his wife but the letters of their four children.  The book follows their private lives and reflects their public lives as they affected their private lives.  Thus we get a much more intimate look at the lives of the famed LaFollette family, including all four of the children:  Senator Robert F. LaFollette, Jr., Governor Phil LaFollette, and the two daughters.  This is a study of a very political family from a standpoint such as I never have read before.

Judges, Senators, and ex-President Teddy Roosevelt--and, for that matter, President Wilson--said shocking things indicating that they had little respect at times for the right of free speech or due process.  The country was caught up in hysteria aimed at winning the war, and demanding conformity from every person in the USA.  I thought, reflecting on the current mood of some that nothing can stand in the way of ferreting out terrorists, that this book had something to say to us, published tho it was in 1957. The book does duly note how much better civil liberties fared in the Second World War as compared to the First World War, for which we have to thank  development of the jurisprudence as to the Bill of Rights since the time of the first World War.

And Stanley Weintraub has done great books which I have found thoroly enjoyable:  A Stillness Heard Round the World: The End of the Great War November 1918, (read 24 Nov 1985); The London Yankees: Portraits of American Writers and Artists in England 1894-1914 (read 29 Apr 1994) and the superlatively evocative Long Day's Journey into War: December 7, 1941 (read 23 Nov 2001). So when I saw this book I at once knew I would have to read it, even though I had such a big TBR pile.  But I did not find the book absorbing, and it made me think that maybe there was not enough to make a whole book attention-holding.  I see Weintraub has a book, The Last Great Victory: The End of World War II.  In view of my experience with his books other than this one, I think I will have to find that book and I think it will be better appreciated by me.	2002-05-14

The arguments go on interminably, and are super-exasperating to read.  I nearly always finish a book I start, so I finished this one, but I confess it was a chore, and I was mighty glad to turn the last page.  Why Warren would want to have anything to do with a repulsive (and certainly mentally unstable) woman like Elissa is incomprehensible.  She is one of the most repulsive central characters I have read about recently.  I confess I did think of Emma Bovary as I was reading, since Emma too specialized in doing dumb things--but I don't remember the arguments going on and on and on interminably.  Elissa is a lawyer, but that she would be as good as she is set out as is highly incredible in view of her inability to do simple logical things in her own life.  And I confess I was annoyed by her being described as Catholic but there never being a hint that her conscience or her Faith played the slightest role in anything she decided or did, or that she ever considered seeking spiritual help, despite all the anguish she went thru.	2002-05-14

I found this book not nearly as attention-holding.  One wonders how bad the interviews that did not make the book were, in view of the &quot;badness&quot; of a few that did make the book.  At least one of the interviewees sounded like a candidate for a mental institution, yet his words, complete with obscenities spelled out, were in the book. Some of the interviews, with well-known folk, like Jim Farley and others had interest.	2002-05-11

It is the first book by Elizabeth Peters I have read, and does not inspire me to read another by her.  I thought the character development was very poor.

I found this a rewarding read, since the life of Dagmar, wife and widow of Alexander III, is full of the events which made Russia a centerpiece of history from 1881 to 1928 (when Dagmar died).  It is not an academic biography but it reads very easily and moves right along.  One cannot help but be appalled by the insensitivity of the Russian ruling class before the Revolution--which no doubt explains the ferocity of the events of 1917 and the following years.  And as one who about 20 years ago was very interested in the Anastasia story, and Anna Anderson, (and after reading Peter Kurth's book Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson on Oct 24, 1983, for a time believed that Anna Anderson actually was Anastasia) this book's incidental account of the denounement of that issue was of high interest. This book will be relished by anyone interested in Russian or royal history. The genealogy tables on the covers are helpful to keep straight the tangled families of European royalty.	2002-04-29

I did not read Dutch because the device I heard about was so off-putting.  I have perused the 70 reviews of this second volume of Morris' trilogy.  Usually when a book has as many as 70 reviews I don't bother to add my review.  But in view of some things some have said, I will do so in this instance.  I think this volume is better than the first!  It tells of possibly less intrinsically exciting events--the period when TR was President was not a really exciting times as our history goes--but this book makes the time--Sept 13, 1901 to March 4, 1909--come fully alive.  Morris is a bit overly hagiographical on occasion, but he does point out flaws and mistakes TR made. TR was a dynamo, and often what he sought was right.  But he also was quick to compromise and so did not accomplish as much as he might have.  Today we shudder at the way he handled the Brownsville matter, and are repelled that he came to regret having Booker T. Washington to lunch at the White House.  I found that much of what I thought of as rather dry comes alive in Morris' telling, and I reflect with much satisfaction on this very good book.  Do not be put off by the size of the book:  there are only 555 pages of text, though the 165 pages of notes are full of interesting items.  I read each chapter and then would peruse the notes for the chapter.  And while the bibliography is &quot;select' it is full of books I have read and enjoyed, as well as books which appear worth reading.  Not long ago (on 24 Feb 2001)I read What Me Befell, The Reminiscences of J. J. Jusserand, which is a source for much of what Morris relates, and it made me want to reread that good book.  I surely hope that I am alive when Morris does the final volume, to fully appreciate the irony in the fact that TR deliberately turned the Presidency over to Taft, then in such a short time came to feel that defeating Taft was so important--after all, TR must have known that running against Taft would elect Wilson.  One presumes that he in 1912 did not think that was so bad, regardless of what he came to feel later.	2002-04-23

Wallace (Norton Paperback)	Books	5	22	25	N	N	Exceptionally well-done	This book does an excellent job of telling of a an amazing life.  Henry Wallace was born in a farm house near Orient, Adair County, Iowa, without benefit of doctor or midwife.  He went on to a life extremely beneficial to the American farmer, especially the corn farmer.  When he was picked to become FDR's Secretary of Agriculture, many American farmers were encouraged, and he went on to be the greatest Agriculture Secretary ever.  His career became much more controversial when he became Vice-President.  This book's account of the 1940 and 1944 Democratic Conventions is extremely informative, and no one who lived through those times, or who has an interest in those momentous events, will fail to be appreciative of the good work the authors of this book have done in telling the story of those amazing political events.  The account of Wallace's aberational seeking of the Presidency in 1948 is full of interest, and one is relieved that by 1950 Wallace's political insight was restored.  This is a great book to read, full of insight into a complicated but amazing man.	2002-04-19

Sickles was born in New York City 20 Oct 1819, served three terms in the House of Representatives, and died May 3, 1914.  This account of his life, tho it has no footnotes and no bibliography, is written in a breezy style that easily captivates.  I was tremendously caught up by the story.  It begins with the account of how Sickles killed Francis Scott Key's son on Feb 27, 1859, then goes back to the beginning and tells the whole fantastic, incredible story of his life, with lots of attention to his Civil War career, including his role at Gettysburg.  As Horatio King wrote in Sickles' old age:<BR>&quot;I see him on that famous field,/ The bravest of the brave,/ Where Longstreet's legions strive to drive/ The Third Corps to its grave./ The fight was bloody, fierce and long,/ And Sickles' name shall stay/ Forever in the Hall of Fame/ As he who saved the day.&quot;<BR>Sickles was a despicable character and yet his life is a fantastic saga.  An excellent book.	2002-04-18

But the life and the period is so fascinating  that I found when I had finished the book that I felt I had really learned a lot.

Francis Preston Blair was born at Abingdon, Va., on April 12, 1791, was editor of the Jackson Democratic paper, the Globe, from 1830 to 1845, and died Oct 19, 1876.  I found this book written with a sprightly style and really enjoyed it.  Francis Preston Blair was a confidant of Jackson and Lincoln, and the father of Montgomery Blair (Lincoln's Postmaster-General till the fall of 1864) and of Francis Preston &quot;Frank&quot; Blair, Jr., who served in the House of Representatives and the Senate from Missouri and was a Civil War general and, with Thomas Hart Benton, is Missouri's representative in Statutory Hall in Washington.  Francis Preston Blair, Sr., was among the earliest Republicans, but reverted to the Democratic Party after the Civil War ended.  His life was an extraordinary one, lived thru momentous years, and this is a good book to read.  It is not overly scholarly--footnotes are not copious and there is no bibliography as such, but the author is clearly at home in the period (he has done a biography of Benton, and discussed it with John F. Kennedy, Benton being a figure in Kennedy's Profiles of Courage), and tells the story well.  The period the subject's life covered is a period of high drama and one that has alwys been a source of fascination for me.	2002-04-10

Contrary to some of the reviewers, when Gordon comes to his senses and ceases from the stupidity (evidenced, e.g., by how he handled $50 he received for a poem--do those reviewers really prefer that kind of behavior on Gordon's part?), he rose in my regard and the whole book in retrospect attained a classic status.

The great triumvirate played a dominating role in the history of our country from 1812 till they died, and reading this book is similar to reading the history of the country during that period, because everything happening politically during that time was affected by one or more of the principals in this work.  Peterson does a great job telling the story.  My only complaint about the book is that it has no bibliography, and it is tough trying to make up such from the 55 pages of notes which are in the book.  How much the book would be enhanced by a  bibliography!  But if the lack of a bibliography does not bother you then you should find nothing to complain about in regard to this book.  I was inspired to read the book by the fact that the author's Lincoln in American Memory is such a great book that it won my personal prize for the best book I read in 1996 (a year in which I read 126 books).	2002-03-30

This fascinating volume considers how Lincoln has been viewed from the time of his death to the time this work came out.  The account of the historical research related to Lincoln's genealogy and his early life is particularly intriguing.  It discusses some of the Lincoln literature and indicates what is worth reading.  For instance, he downgrades Otto Eisenschiml's sensational Why Was Lincoln Murdered?, which made such a splash when it came out in 1937, and recommends The Lincoln Murder Conspiracies, by William Hanchett as the best book on the assassination and its historiography.  This was the best book I read in the year when I read it, a year in which I read 126 books.	2002-03-30

He made various trips around Alabama and relates stories he heard from people.  He was at Decatur, Ala., at the time the second Scottsboro trial was about to be held.  He relates comments by people he talked to about the trial and the comments are a sad picture into the racism rampant in Alabama in those years.  The book uses the n word without any qualms, and tho the author does not appear to approve of the Jim Crow way of life his condemnation is absent.  I did not appreciate this dated book, which in 1934 was a best seller.	2002-03-18

I had been somewhat put off by the idea of an oral history.  But the minute I started on the book I found it very readable and the accounts absorbing.  True, some of the interviewees said things that were disagreeable or dumb, but all were interesting to read.  I find I like hearing about what experience one had in the war, and this book has such accounts of over 100 people, some quite famous, and others unknown.  Some of the persons exhibited a bitter or cynical attitude, which might have been different if the interviews had been taken after the Cold War ended, but I suppose if they had been taken after Sept 11 a new note of pessimism would have been apparent.  Reading this book raised to 20 the number of General Non-Fiction Pulitzer prize winners I have read, but there are 23 I have not read.  I am glad this book won a Pulitzer prize, else I never would have read it.	2002-03-10

So when I saw this book I thought it would be fun to read, and it is.  The author incivisvely comments on the best seller lists during the 20th century, and of course it is fun to see which books one read were best sellers.  I was surprised to see that I had read 101 books which were number 1 best sellers in a year, either in fiction or non-fiction.  This surprised me since I do not use, or at least I have not for many years, the best seller list to decide what to read.  It is also interesting to see which great books never made the list.  For instance, The Killer Angels, by Michael Shaara, I have thought an outstanding book ever since I read it back in 1981, and it won a Pulitzer Prize, but never made a year best seller list!  If nothing else, this book will open your eyes to how much poor choosing some people do when they decide to buy a book...	2002-03-10

The author does not mention his first wife who died in 1893 at all and does not name his second wife, whom he married in 1900.  I learned about his marriages from reading the article on him in the Encyclopedia <BR>Americana, not from reading the book.  DePew's fame came from his speeches and his political activity.  In 1910 he published his addresses and orations in 8 volumes!  The book is not modest about its author and  sounds like one would expect a garrulous man in his eighties who is used to being deferred to would sound, telling what a great guy he is and what great people he has known (every President from Lincoln to Coolidge!). The book was written before Harding died and DePew says Harding is \\"developing the highest qualities of leadership.\\"  This quote illustrates a flaw in the book:  he usually only tells us good things about people he knew, tho he must have known interesting unfavorable things about many of the people he talks about.  All in all, I enjoyed reading this book by a man who was a household name in his lifetime but I suppose is unknown to most people today.  I found the book in a college library.  (I like college libraries--they don't weed out old books as public libraries too often do.)	2002-03-02

I read with great appreciation his Native Son a long time ago, and just recently read Black Boy and found it very attetion-holding.  Savage Holiday is ridiculously plotted and the central character is extremely annoying.  The long account of his running around naked in his apartment house was irritating and  frustrating to me.  All he had to do was hold his newspaper in front of himself and go to an apartment and tell what happened and the manager could have been summoned so he could get in his apartment.  I know, the guy was nuts, as we see as the story moves along, but I was very unenthused by this book.  I can see why it was ignored by critics when it came out in 1954.	2002-02-24

John Byng was sent to the Mediterranean in 1757 with a weak squadron, engaged in a battle with the French off Minorca, and then the next day the squadron--some ships in which had been badly damaged--went back to Gibralter.

I found it an attention-holding and riveting experience, not likely to be soon forgotten.  While the language is often crude, obscene, or blasphemous, I recognize that it can be felt this is necesary for \\"authenticity\\" though that makes it no less repulsive and objectionable.  As one is caught up in the account of an extremely volatile and often stupidly-behaving Gulf War veteran I could not help but think of books I have read about horrendous war experiences (e.g., In Flanders Fields, by Leon Wolff, Eye-Deep in Hell, by John Ellis, With the Old Breed, by E. B. Sledge, or We Were Soldiers Once...And Young, by Harold G. Moore and Joseph Galloway)and wonder what men who had survived experiences such as are described in those and similar books would think of the reaction of Chet Brown, Jr., to the 100-hour ground war in the desert.  That said, and especially if one is current on tank operations and lingo, and is not put off by the completely amoral attitude to sex displayed by all the characters of the book, reading this book is a powerful and absorbing experience.	2002-02-15

Shirer.  Neither of those books can hold a candle to this well-researched and well-written study.  May brings new insights into the momentous events of 1938 to 1940, and they provide thought-provoking and well-reasoned answers to questions which have been the subject of study ever since the fall of France.  I think May supports well his thesis that with a few different happenings Hitler could have been defeated in 1939 and even in 1940, with a result changing our whole subsequent history.  (Incidentally, I question the indication that the book has 384 pages.  It has 484 pages of text, 48 pages of footnotes, and a 50 page bibliography.)  This is a book you will find well worth reading if the events of the time are of interest to you, and especially if you lived thru them as did I.	2002-02-14

The book tends to be a bit long, but it is action-filled and while not as good as the other books by Horgan it still is, as indicated by my caption, worth reading.	2002-02-12

It is written by a sociologist who views his subjects quite favorably.  My reaction as I read was:  \\"I am glad I am not a Hutterite.\\"  But if one was indoctrinated as they are from earliest childhood, I suppose one would be accepting of the restrictions which permeate their life.  For example, toilet training frequently begins at three months but always by the time the child can sit alone.  Such a regimen probably affects one's entire life, and accounts for the low rate of dropouts from Hutterite life style.  The book is a 1974 book, and at the time there were 21,521 Hutterites in 229 colonies, compared to 1265 who came to this hemisphere in 1874.  Researching on the Internet I note that there are some 38,000 in 1999.  A colony branches out into a daughter colony in about 14 years.  If you are interested in viewing a world different from anything you know you should read this book.	2002-02-12

There is a lot of original research, but I thought its reliance on a book like The 103rd Ballot, which itself relies too much on secondary sources, was unfortunate.  It has footnotes, but no bibliography as such--to get the books relied on one would need to go through the 63 pages of fotnotes and note the first time a book was noted, which should have been done for the reader by including a bibliography.  Outside of these faults this book tells a great story and recounts the fantastic career of Al Smith in a very readable and interesting way.  Especially good are the chapters on the 1928 campaign and on the years thereafter.  One cannot help but be appalled at the awful bigotry which marked the 1928 campaign--I am sure glad I did not have to live through it: I would have been very sad for my country.	2002-02-05

I found the early part unappealing and I was mightily annoyed by the semi-literate usage (would you believe that the author used &quot;were&quot; when &quot;was&quot; was the normal usge and &quot;was&quot; when &quot;were&quot; was the normal usage? This impeded my reading for many pages, tho I finally got used to it.)  It would have helped a lot if I had known how famous and controversial the Kelly Gang is in Australia.  So, I think, you will appreciate the entire book more (if you don't know anything about the Kelly Gang) if you would put &quot;Kelly Gang&quot; into your browser and this will lead you to a very comprehensive site dealing with the subject. That way you may enjoy the entire book, instead of like me only the latter part of the book.	2002-01-31

I must have thought it was just a Western and I ordinarily skipped them.  Surely a mistake, I now know since after reading the book I surely want to see the movie (rated five stars and &quot;one of the best westerns  ever made&quot; in my Video and Movie Guide). I was really caught up in this story, and my attention was held as surely as when I read &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot;--also a book told from a young boy's view.  I found Shane a poignant, thrilling, suspenseful and satisfying book, and it can be read in a very short time, since it is truly unlaydownable and only 214 pages.	2002-01-29

There is a good text, which gives the background for the events which led to the cemeteries and memorials depicted.  The photos are sobering, and if you are a student of photography would be of great interest.  I sometimes thought the photos were designed more to show off the photographer's skill than to depict what was to be seen--which I confess is what I was looking for in the book, since I have never seen on the ground the awesome sights related to the First World War, and I suppose I never will.  I did not appreciate this book as much as I did a book by Rose E. B. Coombs:  Before Endeavours Fade:  A Guide to Battlefields of the First World War, which I read on 4 May 1991 and which I thought was almost as worthwhile as going to France to see the sites discussed for myself.  Garfield's book has many poignant quotes, but unfortunately does not have a bibliography of any kind.	2002-01-19

I usually don't write a review of a book which already has 255 reviews but I will in this case.  I had read in October of 2000 Page Smith's excellent two-volume biography of John Adams (1155 pages) and figured that I had read enuf about John Adams.  But since all five books by McCullough that I read before this one were such great reading (The Johnstown Flood, The Great Bridge, The Path Between the Seas, Mornings on Horseback, and Truman)I decided I would have to read this one too.  Am I glad I did!  It is better than Page Smith's because it takes less time to read, and yet covers the amazing life that Adams had fully and with great verve.  One small question:  the book says Adams was buried across the street from the church, but that great book, Who's Buried in Grant's Tomb, by Brian Lamb, says that he is buried in the church crypt, and the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress says he is buried &quot;under&quot; the church.  Did they first bury him in the graveyard and then move him to the crypt?  That seems unlikely...	2002-01-19
1695576:US	52754918	R2FGACQ3H9FG9A	0399120181	387601639	The last of the Scottsboro boys	Books	5	32	32	N	N	An unusual and successful account	I came across this book quite by accident, and because I still remembered how much I appreciated and was engrossed by Scottsboro:  A Tragedy of the American South, by Dan T. Carter, when I read it in December of 1969, I at once decided to read this book.  This is a very different kind of book, and tells the story of the Scottsboro Boys from an entirely different angle, but it is just as compelling a book as is Carter's masterpiece.  Clarence Norris was one of the nine Scottsboro boys and since he only went to the second grade, his contribution to this autobiography was via tape recorder.  Wisely, the collaborator with Norris did not fancy him up, and we get to know Norris as he was:  burdened by the ways of the South toward the Negro in the 1920s and early 1930s, with no high regard for some traditional moral behavior, never hestitating to lie or steal or indulge his weaknesses, but nevertheless tremendously wronged by an almost unbelievably racist environment.  There can be no doubt that the Scottsboro boys were innocent of rape, that they were accused because they got in a fight with some white boys and threw them off the train all were hitching a ride on.  One stands in amazement at the mentality that would let them be condemned to death because they angered some white persons by failing to conform to the desired pattern of subservience.  One mourns to learn that the white Southern judge who was conscientious enough to set aside a guilty verdict was at the next election rewarded by being voted out of office.  The book  does not rely on only Norris' account of what happened, but includes excerpts from the trial transcripts almost unbelievable to one used to fair courtroom procedure.  And the life of Norris and his vicissitudes (many attributable to his own behavior) after he got out of prison is a fascinating window into a life most of us are unacquainted with, which I found just as attention-holding  as the account of the horrendous prison situations which facedhim.  And the ending of the book, with a meeting with Governor George Wallace, is one to relish after so much that went before which makes one cringe.  This is a compelling book which you will never regret taking the time to read.  It was in our libray and is probably in yours, I hope.	2002-01-13

The book is easy to read and should be read by anyone interested in the type of book which The Power and the Glory is.	2002-01-12

Glaucus, an Athenian in Pompeii, loves Ione, as does Arbaces, an Egyptian of evil.  Nydia, a blind slave, also loves Glaucus.  Arbaces kills Apaecides, brother of Ione, who has become a Christian, and then blames the killing on Glaucus, who has become temporarily crazed by a supposed love potion given him by Nydia--after Nydia took it from Julia, who had gotten it from a witch at Arbaces' urging.  To illustarte the fulsome style:  &quot;The eyes of the crowd folowed the gesture of the Egyptian, and beheld, with ineffable dismay, a vast vapour shooting from the summit of Vesuvius, in the form of a gigantic pine-tree, the trunk, blackness,--the branches, fire!--a fire, that shifted and wavered in its hues with every moment, now fiercely luminous, now of a dull and dying red, that again blazed terrifically forth with intolerable glare!&quot;  You will not soon forget this awesome book.	2002-01-11

Mann's very readable and informative work on the medieval popes)I found that this book, despite its provocative title, does a good job telling the history of the Popes in 317 pages.  When I first saw the book I expected to merely browse thru it but it caught me up and I read it all. I am giving it five stars not because I agree with all the author's judgments but because it is so well-written that there is not a dull page in the book.  He tilts some to the &quot;liberal&quot; side, but that is to be expected, and I liked the fact, e.g., that he spent more time on Nicholas V than on Alexander VI.  Incidentally, I did not have any trouble knowing which Leo or Gregory was being discussed, since they are all pretty individual persons one is not likely to confuse.  An attention-holding and eminently readable work.	2002-01-07

For a really good state history, read History of North Dakota, by Elwyn B. Robinson.  I found that state history (I am not from either Nev. or ND) unputdownable.	2002-01-04

I can understand those who were in the rescued camp or in the unit rescuing the prisoners, or those related to someone who was, being enthusiastic about the story being told.  But I did not find the author did a good job of telling an important and heroic story.  I think there is no comparison between this work and Flags of Our Fathers, which I found a superlative read, and with excellent references and bibliography.  The bibliography in Ghost Soldiers is pitiful.  The book has no index and no footnotes.  There is not a list of the persons rescued nor of the rescuers.  All of these things would have been appropriate in a book such as this.  The writing at times seemed jejune.  I much more appreciated a lesser known book:  The Hike into the Sun: Memoir of an American Soldier Captured on Bataan in 1942 and Imprisoned by the Japanese until 1945, by Bernard T. Fitzpatrick with John A. Sweeter III, which I finished reading on 1 April 1995.  I  hoped it would at least be in the bibliography, but of course it isn't.  There are a lot better books on the Pacific War out there, and I did not think this book compared at all with Flags of Our Fathers, nor with the extremely moving book from the Vietnam War: We Were Soldiers Once...and Young (which I hear is going to be a movie!) For a good example of how a story should be told see Abandon Ship! The Saga of the U.S.S Indianapolis, the Navy's Greatest Sea Disaster, by Richard F.  Newcomb.	2001-12-31

But no one interested in World War I should omit reading this and I now have and I have found it eminently well worth reading. I think it is more felicitously written than is Gilbert's book, with a surer grasp of the topic and one is bowled over anew by the epic things Keegan points out. I suppose I have read maybe 100 books on the First World War, but this is one not to be omitted regardless of how much one has read in the area.	2001-12-11

But I am very glad that I decided to read it.  It is a great and balanced account of a fascinating life.  No one interested in the polical history of the past half-century should fail to read this. I found that I could read with undivided attention even tho the TV was on!  It simply caught me up, and there was never a dull page.  One has to be bothered by some of the political practices which Tip indulged in but on the other hand I am sure that an honest portrayal of his opponents would indicate that they were no more scrupulous in regard to choice of tactics.  This is a great, great read, and not while one gets a favorable impression of Tip this book is not hagiographical. So don't not read it because Tip was a great Democrat.	2001-12-09

This book is aimed at presenting a favorable picture of him, and is written kind of like old-fashioned biographies.  It pays excessive attention ro Hayes' diary, and contains considerable trivia.  Some chapters are boring.  The most interesting chapters are are, obviously, on 1876 and 1877 and the dramatic events around Hayes' election to the Presidency.

It starts by telling of the False Armistice, then on to the meeting in the Forest, the 72 hours before the signing, the events in Germany, the Kaiser's going to Holland, the signing, the last shots, and the celebrations.  There is much poignancy, and little things reduced me to tears.  The material is gathered from accounts of people who were there and numerous memoirs and secondary sources.  The book also tells of fiction treating the events--for instance, Parade's End, by Ford Madox Ford (which I read 7 Sept 1984 and did not like).  This book is an enjoyable book to read about a fantastic time:  November 1918.	2001-11-26

Those chapters are a fitting end, since the events in the prior part of the book are sobering indeed. While there are a minimum of footnotes, and no real bibliography, the account sounds quite trustworthy. He often mentions authors:  James Jones, J. G. Ballard, Pappy Boyington (yes, he did a book:  Baa Baa <br />Black Sheep, which I read 14 Aug 1990), Ezra Pound, Emily Hahn, etc.  I found this a great book , even tho Dec 7, 1941, is now overshadowed by the newer day of infamy:  Sept 11, 2001.	2001-11-26

Since the author was a very influential juror, pulling for the winner of the case, his selection of things from the transcript probably is skewed some, but if so it is not obvious.  I was fascinated to read how the judge allowed the lawyers, especially the lawyer for Pennzoil, to &quot;run wild&quot; in voir dire, and one cannot but think that the fact the lawyer gave the judge $10,000 for his election campaign may have at least subconciously influenced the judge.  This campaign contribution is discussed in the book, but the author apparently does not see the obvious solution:  a lawyer who gives money to a judge should be barred from practicing before that judge.  This would soon have Texas going to a better method of selecting judges, as many states have.  This is a book which anyone who wants to see how a juror reacts to what goes on should read.  A fascinating account of a mammoth case.	2001-11-12

I had read Murdoch's The Sea, the Sea years ago (well, I finished it Dec 4, 1983, if you really want to know that) and had been underimpressed by it. I should have read the reviews on Under the Net on this site before I read it.  That would have given me some clue to what I was supposed to expect and derive from the book.  I am no student of Ludwig Wittgenstein, but if I had known that Hugo was supposed to be based on him, it might have made me more alert to what he did,e.g.  But I read the book as I do any other, and I found it very unimpressive--and I know that is my fault, I suppose.  So I guess what I am saying is that if existentialism, Wittgenstein, Sarte, Bellow, etc., don't get you very interested  you might not enjoy this book.  I found I was glad when I was nearing the end--tho I admit that  the last ten pages I rather enjoyed!	2001-11-11

This is a biography written as good biography should be written:  chronologically, with footnotes and a 12-page bibliography.  A touch I appreciated is that the author has visited the sites where Marie Antoinette was and tells what is to be seen there now.  She even makes reference to the fantastic apparition supposedly viewed by Charlotte Anne Moberly and Eleanor Jourdain on Aug 10, 1901!  This is an immensely satisfying book, and well worth the time spent reading it, IMHO.	2001-10-29

As expected, there is very little modesty displayed in this book, but then Senator Specter has had a very successful career. This book captures one's interest from the start, and I found that I could read it even tho my wife was listening to tv in the same room! It was just so much more interesting than what was being said on tv. His account of the questioning of Anita Hill is especially riveting, and he does a good job of showing that she did actually change her testimony over the noon recess, thus showing that her credibility was rightly considered suspect. On the Bork nomination I happened at the time to disagree with Senator Specter's position, but he does a fairly good job justifying his opposition to Bork. Anyone who has followed national news for the past 40 years will find reading this book a rewarding experience, I would think	2001-08-30

The book is meticulously researched, and presents, after the examination of the problems sometimes encountered with Supreme Court justices who would not resign, a simple and I think probably effective solution which would not require a Constituional amendment. The book also includes an appendix which lists the burial site of each Justice.  Ten are buried in Arlington Cemetery and none are buried west of Boulder, Colorado.

I greatly enjoyed the essays in this book, and I agree that the best of the nine is Alan T.

I found this a fast-moving, slashing story and one has the impresion that it is carefully researched.  I read my encyclopedia's entries on the siege and battle of Seringapathan and as far as I could tell the book is all right, except that the fictional characters are not mentioned in the article.  (:  We all know of Arthur Wellesley but some of us did not know of Baird.  In the Brittanica article on Baird we find:  &quot;In the defeat of Col. Baillie's force by Hyder Ali, Baird was taken prisoner, and remained a prisoner for four years.  After a short interval at home he returned to India in 1791 and took part in the campaign against Tippoo.  After serving at the Cape of Good Hope he returned to India, and took part in the last war against Tippoo.  Maj. Gen.

There is nothing compelling about this book and it is hard to see why anyone would say that it is worth reading. The review by  S. Berner is exactly right, and I am disappointed that I did not read that review before I read the book.  If I had, I hope I would have sense enough to not read the book. With all the great books there are to read, why waste one's time on a book such as this?	2001-07-16

I began this book June 24 and finished it today (July 9), which is a long time for me to be reading a book, but it is full of interesting and incredible things, things I suspect many New Yorkers don't know about their city.  I recommend this book, but I have a complaint:  there are no footnotes.  If one wants to determine the source for a statement it is practically impossible.  For example, on page 828 there is a statement that Bishop Hughes boasted that Monsignor Bedini, the papal nuncio who visited in 1852, had as his mission to subjugate the American republic.  This sounds pretty incredible, and so I went to the References for the section to see what the source of this statement is.  20 books are listed for the section and there is no way to determine which book supports the cited statement!  The books for the section are listed alphabetically by author's name only!  In the effort to make a easily read book, the authors have ignored the need for persons to be able to check on the book's accuracy.  This is a real defect, and prevents me from giving the book the five stars which it would get if only interest and fascinating information contained in the book were considered.	2001-07-10

There are no footnotes, and chapter notes merely cite a volume--so if one wanted to check the accuracy of what the book says one would have to check the entire cited source, rather than a page in the source!  The author did a lot of interviewing, so the book is full of &quot;war stories,&quot; some of which seem exaggerated.  The book is clearly written for the non-scholar and while I like &quot;popular&quot; history (Richard Hough's Admirals in Collision was the best book I read in 1971) I thought this book too &quot;popular&quot; and a more scholarly study would have been more worthwhile reading.	2001-07-09

(I don't think one should inflict one's review of a book on others unless one does actaully read the entire book.) I found this book tedious at times, especially, naturally, when he was talking about things I know little about and really don't care very much about--the more obscure things about painting, for instance.  Some reviewers have mentioned Paul Johnson and Norman Davies.  I read (on March 8, 1992) Johnson's Modern Times: The World from the Twenties to the Nineties and found it much easier and more fun to read than this book. I also (on Jan 7, 1998) read Norman Davies' Europe: A History, and found it more interesting and a lot easier reading than this book (and not simply because it is not a cultural history as this book of Barzun's is).  There are a lot of good things in this book, but the poor footnoting is an example of poor editing.  At times I could find no footnote for the page even tho a footnote was indicated.  And I would have liked a real bibliography, or at least a list of every book the author tells us we should read (I know, I should have made a list of his recommendations as I was reading--but how convenient it would be to have all the recommendations listed on a couple of pages, instead of having to go thru the book hunting them!).  I am somewhat hesitant to read what he recommends since I did not find the book he wrote compelling reading.  But there is much worth reading and savoring in this book, and the last chapter says many true things about today's world.	2001-06-11

It is by Samuel Hynes, and was published in 1988 by Frederic C. Beil and New York Naval Institute.  It is a great book, albeit one is disturbed by the great amount of boozing and whoring (no doubt truthfully) the author describes.  But the author, now a distinguished author and professor of literature--unless he has retired by now--tells a poignant and realistic story of how he trained to be a pilot and was in 1944 commissioned as a Marine Corps aviator, and went on to action in Okinawa.  The closing chapter is especially thought-provoking and I was sorry to see the book end.  I wish the author had told us more, about how his hasty war-induced marriage went when he returned, and how he came to his present eminent position--little in the book prepares one for his eventual success, except it is obvious that Samuel Hynes is a writer of real power.  This is the fourth book by him I have read.  The others are The Edwardian Turn of Mind (finished 17 Oct 1993); The Auden Generation:  Literature and Politics in England in the 1930s (finished Nov. 4, 1993); and A War Imagined:  The First World War and English Culture (finished 21 Sept 1999).  Reading this book will not remind you of these other books, which are a different genre, but also eminently worth reading.	2001-05-24

DuBois should be felt to be entitled to two Pulitzer prizes.  The author disapproves at least on the surface of some of DuBois's more outrageous positions, but yet Lewis's biases show thru, and one gets the idea that in general if Lewis had not had the benefit of what has happened in regard to Communism in the past 15 years Lewis would be even more approving of DuBois's opinions than he now indicates.  As others have mentioned, it is disconcerting to have a book from a major publisher have so many typographical errors.  One would think they could have been easily avoided.  And the endnotes are a nightmare.  Instead of footnotes there are page notes in the back, with no discernible system: some indicate sources, but I found them very user-unfriendly.  There is no bibliography as such, and overall I thought the book poorly edited.  But the book tells a story of interest, especially during the period from 1945 to 1963.	2001-05-21

Precious  Bane is all dark and sober and dreary, as it tells of rural English life.  Cold Comfort Farm, first published in 1932, is grotesque and airy and ends unbelievably happily.  Flora, with a hundred pounds a year, goes to Cold Comfort Farm to visit her very odd relatives.  She at once takes it upon herself to transform the people there.

It is fiction only because it supplies lotsa dialogue for June 25, 1876--the day of Custer's Last Stand.  This book presents all the events as very concentrated in time, whereas I before reading it had the impression the events were spread over several days.  I am confident this book is pretty accurate as to what happened.  This is a very poignant book, and made me feel I was with the people on that fateful day.  Most worthwhile reading.	2001-05-15

It is an amazing story of pioneer hardship and of a real character who was so mean he makes me cringe.  He tells of life as I am sure it was in Nebraska not long ago--he died in 1930.  The book has moments of poignancy, even for one who never knew the hardship:  &quot;They would never hear the thunder of the ice going out on Niobrara again, never see the gold of autumn along the bluffs, the ash, the slender yellow pencils, the cottonwoods rustling in chartreuse and orange, the creeper blood splashes on the silver of the buffalo berries.

The author begins his story in January, 1945, when he was almost ten, tho there are some flashbacks.  He tells an engaging story, and one cannot help but empathize with the rough time he had in the years from 1945 to the time he came to America with his mother.  I was a bit bothered that he did not tell us when he heard of Hitler's death, and what his and his parents' reaction was.  I suspect that this was because the true reaction may not have been appreciated by his readers.  I felt my time reading this unpretentious story was well spent.	2001-05-08

Somervell's abridgment of Arnold Toynbee's first six volumes A Study of History, so I cannot claim to be a student of his work, but I was impressed mightily by that reading.  This biography of Toynbee by the eminent historian William H. McNeill is of consistent interest and does not fail to relate Toynbee's troubled personal life as well as explore his eminent historical writing life.  After reading this bio I concluded that Toynbee's theories and prophecies have not proved overly valid.  E.g., he feared the U.S. more than Soviet Russia, and that is a novel and unspportable fear to me, naturally.  Toynbee, along with most great thinkers, did not foresee the Soviet collapse.  I think an interesting work would be an exploration of the why so many people looked on Communism as the wave of the future, even including Whittaker Chambers.  Does anyone know of a good book exploring that phenomenon?	2001-05-07

But the idea of present day person living in 1869 and knowing all that has happened since is a difficult one.  Conrad Richter uses a similar device in The Waters of Kronos and I liked that book.  But the author here did not succeed in making me believe in the scenario, and this got in the way of enjoying the book.  But I suppose the scores and the like are authentic?

(I have now read 39  winners and that leaves 15 unread.)  This book starts very oddly and people who quit reading if they are not caught up by a book by page 25 will probably quit reading this.  They shouldn't.  It would have helped me if I had read the back of the title page, which tells whence Susan Sontag drew her inspiration, and how this book relates to the factual setting of the period.  I found this book once the central character and her group decided to come to America very interesting reading, and consistently holding my attention. Extra tidbits which interested me were the stray references to events and people referred to in the story:  e.g.: Mayne Reid?  Do you know who he was?  I looked him up in a reference work.  Ditto as to the novel and play East Lynne.  This is a historical novel where the factual historical references are accurate so far as I can tell, not like some historical novels.  I remember how bothered I was by Sir Walter Scott's Kenilworth, which had no chronolgical consistency to it that I could see. (The story is laid in the period 1574 and 1575, but Amy Robsart actually died in 1560; Shakespeare appears in the book, but was not even born before Amy Robsart died.) Give this book a chance, I say.	2001-04-28

Its early part, setting out the sad record of the Church in regard to killing people I found super-traumatizing.  What a relief it is to see the change which has come in the Catholic position in the last 25 years!  I will quote four compelling memorable sentences:  &quot;Punishment, yes.  Death, no.  People are not to be killed--not by any 'right' of the state, not in God's name, not for revenge, not to deter another, not at all.  That is the nature of the right to life, the dignity of the human person, the law of God, and the teaching of Jesus.&quot;  This is one of the most important and memorable books I have ever read.	2001-04-24

She not only befriends the murderers, but also the families of their victims--some of whom pant and hunger for revenge.  I found this a memorable and thought-provoking book, though I need no book like this to convince me that the deliberate, pre-meditated killing of a human being is wrong, no matter who does it.  The state should not emulate the people who do deliberate, pre-meditated killing.  Look at the definition of murder in your state's laws, and note that capital punishment fits the elements thereof to a t, except for the word &quot;unlawful&quot; inserted therein.  In Iowa the elements of murder are completely fulfilled by a killing if it is premeditated, deliberate, and with malice aforethought.  What element of murder is missing in capital punishment? None of the named, one must conclude.	2001-04-24

It is hard to imagine how this subject could be handled better than does the author in this very good book.  His careful tho unobtrusive footnoting cites often appropriate volumes from Lawrence Henry Gipson's 13-volume opus, The British Empire Before the American Revolution (which I read during the period from 9 May 1982 to June 29, 1982), but this book's purpose is different, and it spends less time relating original source data.  Anderson does a stupendous job showing the importance of the French and Indian War to the development of the attitude which resulted in the American Revolution, as well as giving a sweeping account of the war and of events immediately thereafter, including Pontiac's Conspiracy and the Stamp Act controversy.  I have known about the battle of Quebec since I studied  about it in 4th grade, but the account in this book I found tells the story vividly and with attention-holding clarity.  If you like real history, shorn of the pop patina some sources and authors deliver, this is a book you will appreciate.  Do not be too daunted by the page total:  There are only 746 pages of text, most chapters are relatively short, the type is clear and not too small.  I found this a good solid work, giving adequate attention to events in England and sufficient information as to other theaters of the Seven Years' War so that one gets the whole picture of a momentous struggle fraught with importance for the shaping of today's world.	2001-04-22

Harry Williams' 1970 Pulitzer-prize-winning Huey Long biography. but when I read it (July 5, 1970) I thought it was far too favorable to Huey.  This book, fortuantely, corrects that and is far more chilling in illustrating the methods of Huey.  We often wonder how the German people could have let Hitler attain power and even some wonder why he remained in power.  Huey Long was not on the level of unmitigated evil that Hitler was, but in his disregard for the rule of law and the basic tenets of democratic government he was as frightening a phenomenom as has come across the American scene that I am aware of.  And when one reflects how revered he is still in Louisiana--his statue is in Statutory Hall in Washington, anybody related to him got elected in Louisiana, etc.--it is apparent that his dictatorship was popular.  Apparently most people thought his disregard for law and democratic behavior was ok because they felt they were better off because of it.  In St. Bernard parish in 1932 Long's slate for state office received 3,152 votes.  There were 2,194 registered voters in the parish.  The opposition candidates received 0 votes.  This kind of voter fraud makes Hitler's wins by 98%, etc., seem honest by comparison.  This is a stunning book and should be read after reading Williams' book so that one gets the whole picture of a stunning situation in American history.	2001-04-19

But this book is a good introduction to Chinese history from 1920 to 1976, and subsequent thereto.  I thought the early parts kind of a chore to read, but was very glad I kept on and the coverage for the years since 1945 was infomative and full of interest.  The author spends no time considering views of Mao from outside China (except from Russia), and such I thought would have been of interest.  For instance, the people who are considered so carefully in Barbara Tuchman's Stilwell and the American Experience in China (read by me with considerable appreciation in September of 1972) figure not at all in this account. What a blessing Mao's death was for China: as great as Stalin's was for Russia and maybe as great as Hitler's was for the world.  The book lacks footnotes, tho there are source notes for the pages.  I was dismayed to see no bibliography:  I presume the author figured one could deduce such from the source notes, but I sure would have liked to see a bibliography.  There are two maps, but neither shows the town where Mao was born.  I think maps in a book should show every city or town mentioned in the book, if possible.  But these are minor complaints and I recommend the book to those who want to read a well-written and carefully researched life of a major figure of the 20th century.	2001-04-16

Sometimes it seemed plodding.  Much of the account of World War II consisted in a continuing catalog of German atrocities and losses in air raids.  I cannot say Gilbert has a good sense of proportion.  Some insignificant things get mentioned (McDonald's gets a sentence) and important things are omitted (U.S. politics is the subject of the merest nods).  Even the birth of Israel is directly mentioned only in telling that the U.S. recognized it minutes after it was proclaimed.

The topic is of interest,, but the author grubs in pre-1776 writing a lot, and I did not find I was caught up in the subject, important tho it is.  The treatment is deep in theory, and intellectual history, and while at times this has interested me, I could not find myself enamored by the book--which is a reflection on me, not on the very erudite author.	2001-04-10

Sometimes I thought the author indulged in hyperbole, and I would have appreciated a little more exactitude, but it no doubt is true that life during the twenties and thirties in northwestern North Dakota was a hard and demanding one.  The first part of this book is the best, as the author relates the fantastic efforts necessary for the kids to be educated.  There is a lot of discussion of Norwegian food, and those of you who are of Norwegian descent will gobble that talk up, but for me I could not get too interested in how her mother went to extraordinary lengths to prepare, under primitive conditions, the food she was so good at concocting. There is less talk of the interesting political events during the time than I would have liked.  Appam, North Dakota, which was apparently a home town to the family during these years, has, according to my 1958 atlas, a population of 18.  I would like to have learned whether it was a bigger place when the author was a child.  But the upbeat attitude to her childhood was a real plus for this book--not the dreary catalog of hardship one sometimes gets from depression sagas.  I liked this book.	2001-04-10

She worked very hard and lived in grinding poverty.  She went to college and then taught school and fended off marriage proposals, and never in the book says a good word for the man she married--who was courting her thru the last years she was keeping her diary.  This I found to be quite a book, unpretentious as it holds itself out to be. A most moving account of a time and place one seldom hears about.  I recommend it unreservedly.	2001-04-09

This book has good chapters on early days in North Dakota, and on the wild times politically from 1915 to 1960.  A better book is A History of North Dakota, by Elwyn B. Robinson, which I read with much appreciation Mar 7, 1989.  Even this book says Robinson's book is the best history of North Dakota.  I thought this book was a little overly defensive about North Dakota, but it is full of interesting facts.  For instance I did not know that Senator Nye, when he heard about Pearl Harbor, went ahead and delivered his prepared speech anyway, castigating the Administration for its foreign policy.

This book is not written in a particularly sprightly style and yet I found it a work fascinating in the extreme.  It starts at the very beginning , and I am sorry it only goes up to 1966.  The chapter on the Non-Partisan League (1915-1923) was the most interesting.  And Bill Langer had a fascinating career, the account of which was made more attention-holding for me because I used to go to the Senate gallery when I was going to law school in Washington and listen to his orations.  Unforgettable, since unique.  This is a great and memorable book.	2001-04-09

This is a famous case, and this book gives all the gruesome details.  Boston in 1849 was a small world and many famous persons flit thru the pages of this book: Longfellow, Melville, Charles Sumner, Edward Everett, Oliver Wendell Holmes, etc.  As a true crime book I found it objectionable that the author purported to tell us what persons thought, but overall the book is not bad and holds one's  interest. A shorter account of the same crime written by the famed crime writer Edmund L. Pearson can be found in the book Crimes That Shocked America, edited by Brant House and published in 1961 by Ace Books, Inc.	2001-04-08

I am overwhelmed by what a good job Kershaw has done.  Reading this volume was somewhat more satisfying than reading the first one, because more bad things happen to Hitler in this volume, which cannot help but please anyone.  The book spends a lot of time showing that Hitler was responsible for the Final Solution, and while I was convinced long before Kershaw finished the book, the documentation is valuable--right up to Hitler's final Testament.  The book is well worth reading, and is not as formidable as it looks since there is an index and 194 pages of footnotes and 37 pages of bibliography.  I started it March 26 and finished it April 1.  It is a great and important book, and is much more definitive than Fest's biography, which I until now thought was the best Hitler bio	2001-04-05

A Tour of Presidential Gravesites	Books	5	2	4	N	N	This is a great book	For years I have wanted to tour World War One battlefields, and finally I came upon Before Endeavours Fade:  A Guide to  Battlefields of the First World War, by Rose E. B. Coombs.  I read it cover to cover and felt doing so was the next best thing to touring those sites.  When I finished reading this book, cover to cover, I thought this is better than going to each birthplace! It is certainly a lot easier, and I found it extremely satisfying to see each gravesite, all in the course of a couple hours, and to learn so many interesting things, like:  What state has the most Presidential graves?  Why is there a picture of David Rice Atchison's gravestone in this book?  What President lived the shortest time after leaving office? If these sort of questions intrigue you, as they do me, get this book and revel in all the fascinating things you can learn from it.	2001-04-03

But once the book gets to about 1931 it becomes absorbing reading, and continues so all thru the war.  I know nothing about the author, except what the blurb on the jacket says, and tho he is US-born, he seems much more at home with Japanese history than with American!  Some of his comments on American history seem simplistic and un-nuanced.  He says, e.g., that at the time of the Panay Incident (Dec. 1937) FDR was in his third term!  But his research in Japanese materials seems awesome.  Of course he has a thesis:  Hirohita was a major war criminal but was protected by the Japanese and by the Americans who were to deal with postwar Japan.  I think he proves his thesis, but you should read the book for yourself and decide that for yourself.  The book is well worth your time if you are interested in events in the Orient and the situation in Japan.	2001-03-27

It is pretty awesome to think that in Washington there were hawks who were in favor of invasion, apparently not knowing or not caring that atomic weapons would have been used to resist the invasion. I read Michael Beschloss' The Crisis Years on Oct 25, 2000, and it was a similar tension-filled read.  The Kennedys come out in this book in the end looking pretty good--at least better than the LeMay types.  But Kennedy bashers can find plenty in this book to revel in, also.  It is a good book.	2001-03-23

I know the gutter language is realistic, as I suppose the amoral attitude is also.  But these aspects pale into insignificance when the story itself is considered.  Webb is not the writer that Pat Conroy is, and this book did not quite tear me apart as much as did The Lords of Discipline, but this book has a far more subtle message, and shows inhuman discipline is not necessarily evil.

Powers concludes that Heisenberg did not want to make a bomb for Hitler, and did not want to state so too plainly after the war.  The thesis is well-supported and I accept it.  This is a book well worth reading, tho not as good as Richard Rhodes' book, which well deserved the Pulitzer Prize it won in 1988.	2001-03-20

Its chronolgy leaves something to be desired, and I at least would have appreciated more footnotes, more explanation of the importance of the historical figures who are involved in the swindle, and a more documentary-like account.  In my (1958) edition of the Encyclopedia American there is a one-paragraph account of The Humbert Swindle, but in my (1940) edition of the Brittanica I find no mention of the affair.  Is this because it involved people who were Dreyfusards rather than anti-Dresfusards? I really think this swindle deserves a better book, tho I suppose Hilary Spurling will say that she has told us all she could find on it.  But in view of the extensive press coverage I find that hard to believe.	2001-03-20

I have read all 53 reviews of this book, which I have just finished reading.  When 51 of the 53 give the book 5 stars and the other 2 give it 4 stars you know that this book is exceptional.  I especially liked the fact that Sledge conveyed the horror of war without finding it necessary to give a tape-recorder-like expletives-not-deleted account of the language of the combatants, or to describe their sex lives.  James Webb, who wrote Fields of Fire, would have benefited from reading this book. I also appreciated the fact that at the end of the book there are pictures of the author as a Marine, to remind us anew what a kid he was when he went thru the events he describes so clearly and memorably.	2001-03-11

I spent a rural boyhood myself, but I cannot say it was as rich and varied and interesting as Jimmy Carter's, and it was not spent in Georgia.  This is a very pleasant book to read, and you will never regret spending a little time reading this well-written book, full of insight and nostalgia.

This book is not.  I found the book fun to read, tho it is not well footnoted and its bibliography is not a first-rate one, in my view.

I have never read a more real account of the emotions of the fighters.  It tells of atrocities on both sides and its last chapter is the most convincing account I have ever read as to why the dropping ot the atomic bombs was absolutely necessary to save American and Japanese lives.  I don't think you will find a better book on the battle of Okinawa.  This I found to be a very excellent book.	2001-03-09

But this is such an exceptionally satisfying book that I have to say some things.  I have read every Pulitzer prizewinning work of fiction, and some selections have been really great and some are terrible.  I was overwhelmed by the 1993 selection, A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain, and this selection is the greatest since that one, IMHO.  I particularly liked that the stories each caught me up quickly--usually a deterrent to enjoying a whole book of short stories.  My favorite in the book was the last one:  A Third and Final Continent.  It left me with a very satisfying feeling, knowing that the author had put the best story of the nine last, instead of first or instead of it being the title story.  This appears  to be the sixth book of short stories to win the Pulitzer for fiction.  The first was Tales of the South Pacific--a selection which apparently caused the prize to be changed from Novel to Fiction.  The others have been 1966:  The Collected Stories of Katherine Anne Porter;  1970: Collected Stories, by Jean Stafford;  1978:  Elbow Room, by James Alan McPherson;  1979:  The Stories of John Cheever;  and 1993's, mentioned above.  Interpreter of Maladies ranks with the best of these.	2001-03-09

She knew many German aristocrats, including ones who suffered the extreme penalty for opposing Hitler.  I found fascinating the account of how life went on in aristocratic circles in Germany while bombs dropped and Hitler ran his terroristic regime.  This is another view entirely from Victor Klemperer's monumental volumes entitled I Will Bear Witness, which I read with sheerest fascination on June 11, 1999, and April 7, 2000, since Missy, the author, almost seemed to bear a charmed life.  But like Klemperer's diary, time seemed to move so slow as one reads, knowing that not till May 8, 1945 would the ordeal end--and not even then because life in Germany postwar was no bed of roses for some time.  If one considers the author as the young woman she was, not one in a position to answer for the rise of Hitler or to impede his ruinous course, the diary is a moving tribute to the human spirit.	2001-03-08

But it screams authenticity to me, which may not mean much since I was never in Vietnam.  But the haunting moral dilemmas faced by the protagonists cannot help but inspire thoughts such as:  what would I have done in a like situation?  While Robert E. Lee Hodges is the central character, Goodrich (&quot;the Senator&quot;) faces the more agonizing situations.  Read the book, and you decide.

He was the French ambassador to the United States from 1902 to 1925.  He began this book and was writing it when he died in 1932, so it is not finished.  It begins with the author's birth and ends about the time Teddy Roosevelt (with whom Jusserand was very friendly) ceased to be President. Many of Jusserand's views are very perceptive, and I was especially struck by his comments about the U.S. acquiring its interest in the Phillipines, and that such might involve this country in war with Japan.  It would be a better book if it covered the time of the First World War, tho of course it is written with the knowledge that that war came. And one must admit that the title is novel, eh?	2001-02-25

I think this means the cops are the good guys, and since the cops usually are such in real life, it is appropriate that there be books which show police work as it probably is.  This book is laid in Glasgow, Scotland, and there is some terminology that is odd to a provincialist such as myself, but that  does not detract from the story.  I seldom read this type book, but I liked it.  I no doubt have read other police procedurals, but the one that comes to mind is Ice, by Ed McBain, read by me on April 2, 1995, when I was doing a list which appeared in Newsweek in 1986 listing the ten favorite crime novels (of David Lehman) of the 20th century, and this book I thought was more enjoyable than Ice.  Incidentally, the other novels on that 10 best list were:  The Hound of the Baskervilles (read by me about 1942);The Man Who Was Thursday (read Apr 20, 1952); The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (read 21 Feb 1995); The Maltese Falcon (read 3 Mar 1995); The Big Sleep (read 21 Apr 1995); A Coffin for Dimitrios (read 17 May 1995); The Big Clock (read 4 June 1995); The Chill (read 17 Sept 1997); Ice (see above); and Glitz (read 28 May 1995).	2001-02-24

It is  easy to read, but is sad and poignant. It speaks first from the viewpoint of the 8-year-old, then from the viewpoint of the 13 year old, finally the denouement:  When I closed the book I realized that it would remain in my memory far longer than most novels.  For those of you familiar with Josephine Johnson's Pulitzer-prize-winning novel, Now in November, am I wrong to think this book resonates the way that book has done (read by me over 40 years ago)?	2001-02-19

This book discusses the Patriarchate of Canstantinople before the fall in 1453 and then relates how it fared under Turkish rule.  It is not a happy story, but well worth reading.

I found his account of his growing up, the books he read, the things he did, the world he lived in vividly described and I could not put the book down.  His account of his trip around the world at age 16-17 was very well told, and I thought it could have been expanded with benefit.  His account of his years as a student also held high interest, and his time in World War II, like most accounts of &quot;my war&quot; are high in attention-holding.  The book begins to pall a little in the account of the time from 1945 to 1950, maybe because it is better known to those of us who lived thru the time and knew of the author's activities during those years--tho his political views and mine I must admit coincided then and still do.  So that helps.  It is true that he name-drops but I was fascinated by the people he knew and by how many &quot;dear friends&quot; he has.  If he knew me I would be glad to read about what he thought of me--and most of what he has to say is not bad.  I think this is a great book, and his next volume, which will include his years with Kennedy, will also be great reading, provided they tell us something not told in A Thousand Days--tho, since I read that book in October of 1966, he can no doubt depend on my not remembering too much of what I read then, and so some repetition is in order.	2001-02-15

While three presidents (Jefferson, John Adams, and Monroe) have died on the 4th of July, Coolidge is the only president to have been born on the 4th of July.  His rise to the presidency is actually a story of amazing luck, and McCoy tells the story very well. While in hindsight it is easy to see that Coolidge was not a great president, at the time he did everything seemingly right, and was very successful in making people think he was a good president.  I found this book held my interest throughout and was a very satisfying read.  I will admit that there were a few chapters on his presidency which were on topics not of interest (can one be intrigued today by, e.g., the Kellogg-Briand pact?) but since one wants to cover the entire life they have to be there.  For those of you reading a biography of every president, this does very adequately for Coolidge.  (Actually, I read William Allen White's A Puritan in Babylon: The Story of Calvin Coolidge, but that was back on May 5, 1947, and my memory of that was not too fresh, so I thought I should read this more recent bio, and am glad I did.)	2001-02-10

Series in American History and Culture in the Twentieth Century)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A top-notch political memoir	William Gibbs McAdoo had a fascinating life, and it seems odd that so many people no longer seem to know of him.  He was born in Georgia in 1863, did not finish law school but was admitted to the bar, and after practicing in Chattanooga for a few years went to New York (all on his own, knowing no one there) and began practicing there.  He had a role in completing tunnels under the Hudson River, and in 1912 played a key role at the Democratic Convention in Baltimore which nominated Woodrow Wilson on the 44th ballot (tho thru 43 ballots McAdoo's ballot was cast for Wilson's main opponent!).  Then he became Secretary of the Treasury, and married Wilson's daughter, tho he was twice her age.  As is usual in political or any kind of memoir, McAdoo is not overly modest, but he says a lot of wise things, and one cannot but be impressed at what he accomplished.  So what he says cannot just be bombast. I found his account of running the railroads during World War One really interesting, and to me it seemed like a huge accomplishment.  Unfortunately the book ends with 1918, even tho it was written in 1931.  So we don't learn about the fantastic convention of 1924 where McAdoo led on 100 ballots, but failed to be nominated, nor of course is there anything about McAdoo's time in the U.S. Senate from 1933 to 1938, nor do we learn why in 1934 McAdoo and Wilson's daughter were divorced.  Does anyone know?  This book of course gives no hint as to any trouble between him and his second wife.  The book is full of shrewd comments, e.g.:  &quot;I have found that a good listener is one who is thinking of something else.&quot;  This book ranks with other great political memoirs I have read, such as My Quarter Century of American Politics, by Champ Clark, (read 25 Jan 1989), The Autobiography of William Allen White (read Nov 3, 1990), and Western Democrat, by Arthur F. Mullen (read 25 Jan 2001).  I would like to read Thirty Years View, by Thomas Hart Benton; Twenty Years in Congress, by James G.

It was first published in 1943, and since Zweig and his second wife committed suicide on Feb. 23, 1942, I presume it was the last thing he wrote that was published.  It is of interest that his first wife in 1946 published a book about her first ex-husband (entitled &quot;Stefan Zweig&quot;). The World of Yesterday says nothing about his marriages, but his wife's book succinctly describes how she learned of her husband's affair:  &quot;Hastening back to the hotel, I entered my husband's study from the bedroom.  Unfortunately it was an inopportune moment.&quot;	2001-01-28

He relates his encounters with Hemingway, Ezra Pound, Henry Miller, Joyce, Pirandello, and many others and the account is of interest.  He talks more about art, including Picasso, than interested me, but all in all this is not a bad book to read.	2001-01-28

The first book by John T. Noonan, Jr., that I read was his tour de force, Contraception:  A History of Its Treatment by the Catholic Theologians and Canonists, which I finished reading on June 5, 1967, finding it an exemplary study of a fascinating subject.  On June 16, 1973, I read his Power to Dissolve:  Lawyers and Marriages in the Courts  of the Roman Curia.  Each year I pick a book which I consider the best book I read that year.  For the year 1973 I awarded Power to Dissolve the greatest book of the 55 books I read that year.  When I saw The Lustre of Our Country I knew I could not go wrong reading it, and I was right.  Other reviewers have written well of the book, but even if you do not read the entire book--its chapters are able to stand alone--read Chapter 7, entitled &quot;The Pilgrim's Process.&quot;  It is a dazzling and devastating critique of the Supreme Court's meanderings in dealing with the religion provisons of the First Amendment. This is an excellent book, and anyone interested in its subject will be rewarded in reading it.	2001-01-27

Indianapolis, the Navy's Greatest Sea Disaster	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Searing, poignant, and a pageturner	This account of the loss of the USS Indianapolis on July 30, 1945, is a book that will tear you apart.  I had an overwhelming sense of empathy as the author takes us thru the awful ordeal that 1196 souls (not, for pity's sake, 8000, as an earlier review has it) on the ship went thru when the torpedoes struck just after midnight on that fateful day, just two weeks before the war ended.  While close to a thousand survived the sinking, only 316 survived the ordeal that followed before rescue.  Chills went up my spine as I rejoiced with those suffering men when it fianlly became clear that they would be rescued.  This book cannot be read dry-eyed, and you will remember it long after other reading you have done has faded from memory.  (The book lists the survivors.  I wish that the publisher had added a list of the non-survivors, tho I have noticed there is a website with a complete list of the men aboard that fateful and horrendous night.)  This is as compelling an account as I have read for a long time.	2001-01-16

So I have not read the revised edition, but the original book is very convincing.  Those critical of it do not explain the evidence and how it fails to show Hiss guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  What Hiss did seems incredible, but the evidence remains convincing, despite all the efforts to show that the evidence in some way should not be believed.  And I speak as one who at the time of Hiss's trial very much was hoping that it would be shown he was not guilty, and as one who voted against Nixon every chance I had (1952, 1956, 1960, 1968, and 1972).	2001-01-03

In other words, he is not concerned about what is true, but simply picks out what he thinks happened and then says it did.  When a historical question is presented, instead of telling us there are two or more versions of what happened, Robinson simply picks out one version and tells us that is what happened!  For instance, he says Pope Boniface VIII had the abdicated Pope, St. Celestine V, smothered with a pillow.  It is true Boniface was accused of that, but I believe it is generally accepted that it is untrue.  Because it &quot;seems to make sense&quot; to Robinson his book says that is what happened.  How many other things in the  book are arbitrarily decided by Robinson &quot;to make sense&quot; and are therefore presented as historical fact I do not know.  But readers should approach this book with caution.  A far better account of the Crusades is Steven Runciman's three volume history.  A historian who avoids giving his sources is to be approached with caution, I feel.	2000-12-28

Because I had such good memories of that great book, I decided to read this bio by Peter Levi.  It does a good job, but whether I am not as interested in Tennyson as I was in 1981 or what, I did not enjoy the book as much.  In my youth I committed to memory a few of Tennyson's poems (including Locksley Hall) and that memorization  has been a source of enjoymnet to me for many years.	2000-12-22

This great book and Great Expectations:  The U.S. 1945-1974, by James T. Patterson, were the co-winners of the 1997 Bancroft History Prize.  I found everything in this book good reading and I learned a lot I did not know about the 27 amendments to the US Constitution.  Congress has proposed 33 amendmants to the Constitution, and 27 have been accepted by the requisite number of states and so were added to the Constitution. The research done to write this book is awesome.  I found this book a much better book than the co-winner of the Bancroft Prize merely because this book told me so much more than I knew before I read it.	2000-12-06

That is why I read books about the Holocaust.  It is also why I read this book, telling of what Mississippi was like for black people in the early 1960s.  The murder of Goodman, Schwerner, and Chaney on June 21, 1964, is a defining event in the struggle to bring Mississippi to greater respect for the basic liberties guaranteed to Americans.  This book tells the story in some detail, and also covers other events leading up to the murders.  And there are some pages telling what has happened since (up to 1988, when the book was published).  Very worthwhile and carefully done.	2000-12-06

The author has accounts of France, Britain, Austria, Prussia, Russia, the USA, Mexico, Peru, China, Japan , India, Turkey, and Africa in the years around 1800, and I found much of the material of high interest, and incitive of further reading.  I noted with some surprise that the bibliography lists a book by Bertita Harding:  Amazon Throne, which I read over 55 years ago and found really enjoyable and memorable.  I really never thought Bertita Harding was a serious historian, since her books are so readable even for a teenager.	2000-12-02

There is a lot about ins and outs of housing fights which gets kind of old.  But the parts dealing with politics are fascinating, and thought-provoking.  Some of the excesses of the Daley machine (which was usually on the side I favored in national elections)are really frightening--the kind of things you expect in a country like Communist Russia or Hitlerite Germany!  And the pity of it was that the judiciary was also under the control, to an extent, of the Daley machine.  The book actually is a powerful argument for selection of judges under what is known as the Missouri plan, rather than in contested elections.	2000-11-30

Admittedly my interest was heightened by the fact that Williams was my criminal law teacher at law school, but I found this a fantastic book. Evan Thomas (did you know he is Norman Thomas' grandson?) paints Williams warts and all, and I found it a searing read.  The account of Williams' deathly fight with cancer is most poignant.  Anyone at all interested in law should read this book, and anyone interested in an amazing life will be enthralled by this account.	2000-11-26

This book goes up to 1999, and portrays very well the current dilemmas facing Australia.  If you enjoy the articles in Current History, as I do, this book reminds me of those articles, except it is less bland and neutral.  Ordinarily I avoid histories with designations such as &quot;short&quot; or &quot;concise&quot; figuring that I want a fuller treatment.  But when one knows as little of a country as I do of Australia, I thought this a good introduction to its history.	2000-11-24

In this book he reviews not only the the papal elections from 1878 to 1922, but actually those from 1800 on.

I could not empathize with anyone in the book, but then I am a man, so I suspect it wasn't intended that I do so.  The men in the book are all despicable, and the women (except for the evil Zenia) are weak and non-admirable usually.  The liberal use of scatological language is off-putting. The ending is non-memorable. But Atwood can write, and while I enjoyed this book less than I did Alias Grace, it is alot better than The Edible Woman.  Those are the only other Atwood books I've read.  I will read Blind Assassin, since I try to read all Booker winners, tho there are a number ot them I've not read.	2000-11-18

I think it does a very good job, and shows that there were good things about Louis XIV as well as bad.  I have know since I was a child that he was succeeded by his great-grandson, and this book makes that knowledge meaningful, as it tells of the deaths of his son and grandson not too long before Louis's own death on Sept 1, 1715.

I no longer believe this.  If it did, the federal system which we live under would be seriously changed.  Small states would lose importance, and campaigners would spend even more of their time in the areas where there are lots of people. It would constitute a drastic change in the system which has served us well for most of our history.  If there should be a change, we should eliminate the possibility of &quot;faithless electors&quot; and in case of no majority we should let the House pick the President, instead of giving the House only one vote as is presently the case.	2000-11-08

But reading the Years of Crisis made me  realize how much more worthwhile non-fiction is than is fiction.  The Years of Crisis was an exciting book about things that really happened, filled with tension and all plausible.  The Charm School is, on reflection, far-fetched and improbable.  The Years of Crisis has various judgments, and if one is a Kennedy admirer, as I was during the years involved (1960-1963), some of them make one uneasy about the rightness of one's view in that long ago time.  But it is comforting that he, Kennedy, did do the right thing, and that 300,000,000 million people did not die in atomic war.  This book is full of the tension of the years involved, and was more tense to read than living thru the time!	2000-10-26

It was so much more real and was just as tense an expperience, even tho I knew how it would come out.  I was some annoyed by the protagonists of The Charm School, very much impressed with the importance of religion--and eager to commit adultery every chance they could, and never a hint that the religion to which she was so attached had anything to do with whether she should commit adultery or not.  But the book holds one's interest, even if on reflection one wonders if the time spent reading it was well-spent.	2000-10-26

This book is superlative to follow Georgia politics in years Watson affected it.  One is totally repelled by Watson after 1904, not only by his vicious anti-Catholicism but even worse by his role in the Leo Frank case.  This book is a sheerly interesting book about an awful man.

It is, I believe, the least intersting and most esoteric book I have ever read.  It reminded me of my reading of Fin-de-Siecle Vienna, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1981, and which I long wanted to read and then when I read it I found it a chore to read, and greatly welcomed the last page.  The last chapter of Transformation made no sense for me at all, and reading this book's only significance is that I have read another Pulitzer Prize winner in history.  I thought I should warn persons who might be overly influenced by the other 3 reviews and might think this would be a great book to read.	2000-10-20

Some of the stuff on the less momentous years was new to me.  There are some errors, e.g., on page 788:  &quot;...a prolonged drought spreading westward from the Pacific Coast...&quot;!  The 1927 account refers to Henry L. Stimson as an ex-Secretary of State, rather than an ex-Secretary of War.  (Stimson did not become Secretary of State till 1929.) FDR is said to have been inaugurated March 3, 1933!  There is limited attention to social trends, literature, and such.  I think a more analytic approach would have been more useful and attention-holding.  Much of the 33 and 1/3 years covered is dismal and sad, but we can't blame Gilbert for that. I feel sure I will read Volume II, I am sure.	2000-10-19

After reading this, I now want to again read what became of the people Let Us Now Praise led us to come to know so intimately.  For many pages of this book reading it was a drag, and only my rigid rejection of the &quot;right&quot; of a reader to quit reading a book he has started caused me to continue reading.  But in time I became glad I was reading it.  The minute listing of every item in a room did not entrance me, but the cumulative effect of the recital of rural poverty accomplished its aim,  Agee has his share of nutty ideas, but they do not overly detract from what he is telling us about Alabama in 1936.  I am glad I read the book, and I will have to again look at And Their Children After Them.	2000-10-19

I now have finally read the work, and I was not wrong.  These volumes tell in fascinating detail of the momentous life of our second president, and it is hard for me to see how the telling could be improved upon.  I have only a few presidents I have not yet done.  Any thought as to the best biography of Millard Fillmore?	2000-10-12

This may seem like a narrow issue to be the subject of a 556 page book, but this book is flawlessly written, and has great humor--exposing the idiocy of the slavery upholders--and at times brought tears to my eyes.  A dropback to the stirring events of 1775 and 1776, found on pages 155 to 157, is as good a writing as I have ever seen evoking the sheer drama of those days.   This is a nigh flawless book for one as interested as I am  in congressional history and the years before the Civil War.	2000-10-12

Hitchcock won two terms in the U.S. Senate, and served from 1911 to 1923.  Anyone who is interested in Senatorial biography, as I have always been, will enjoy this work.

Smith actually had an amazing career (elected to the House of  Representatives in 1940 and to the Senate in 1948, reelected in 1954, 1960,  1966, and defeated for reelection in 1972) and this unpretentious book,  solidly but not exhaustively researched, recounts it well.

This I confess  startled me since tho I knew there were Confederate sympathizers in the  South I did not think at this day and age there were some who still  believed slavery was other than an evil system.  This is a pretty  interestingly put together book, tho not very profound.  But I was glad I  read it.

The exorcism which occurred at Earling, Iowa, has been a subject of interest to me all my life. This book expands on the pamphlet Begone Satan, which was first published about 1936 and attracted extreme interest. Time had a full page article about the pamphlet. The pamphlet itself is not carefully written, and so this book, which sensationalizes what is found in Begone Satan and supplies all the X-rated language which Begone Satan omitted, is not to be relied on as being totally factual. A small example of the looseness with research in this book is that it states Sept. 20, 1928, when the first series of exorcisms came to an end, was a Friday. I at once knew this was wrong, since I was baptized by Father Steiger on Sept 20, 1928 (I was two days old) and I knew--and any perpetual calendar will quickly tell--that Sept. 20, 1928, was a Thursday. There are other inaccuracies, and much of the early part of the book is as the author imagined the events probably happened. But the fact is that a series of exorcisms were carried out at Earling in 1928, and the devil manifested himself there in ways that seem fantastic but that are not explainable unless he exists. This may not be a very fashionable view, but of course the devil's greatest wish is that people believe he not exist. The book is an easy read, and introduces one to a fascinating event. The sad part is that there is no really scholarly study of the case available to the public.	2000-09-04

Short was Mayor of Sioux City from 1918 to 1924.  This book tells of his interesting life.  It is not too well-written, but it does  show a lot of research.  Short was born June 28, 1866, this book tells us,  but amazingly enough it does not tell the date of his death.  A footnote  tells that his death was noted in the New York Times of Jan. 4, 1953, so  that must be about the time of his death. Short was a commendable person in  his standing up for free speech, in his ability and courage in standing up  against the Anti-Saloon League, and in his opposition to the Ku Klux Klan.  This book is well worth reading for anyone interested in Iowa history or  Sioux City history.	2000-08-17

I have no Southern background, and have always been pleased the Civil War  turned out as it did, but his book gives some insight into the thinking of  the secessionists and Southerners in the time of the War.  The book is  excellently edited, and the literary footnotes are a big help to see what  the intelligent Southerner  was reading during the war.  Now I would like  to read a biography of Mrs. Chesnut or of her husband.  (The frank tension  between Mary and her husband is an interesting sidelight to the main story  of the diary.)	2000-07-18

It is a good workmanlike story even if without much in the way of elegant writing.    A thing that I could not understand is that  John Quincy Adams is referred to as  the fifth president, and quite a point  is made of this.  Is this a deliberate device to see how many people will  point out that John  Quincy Adams was not the fifth president of the United  States but the sixth president?  I tried to find a way to write to Jim  Lehrer and ask him why he made this obvious error, but Random House's web  site says they won't forward e-mail to him,(or any other author).  Does  someone know why the book calls John Quincy Adams the fifth president?	2000-07-13

But except for that defensiveness, this is a good  book, capped by the astounding information which she gives of  what  happened to Cromwell's body after Charles II came back to England.  That  account alone makes the book  worth reading.  I suspect I will never again  note September 3 as memorable only because Engkand abnd France declared war  on Hitler on that date.  Cromwell won two of his greatest victories and  died on that date as well.  (Though that was, I presume, old calendar).

But the book is actually meticulously  researched and very copiously footnoted and it is full of detail I had  either forgotten or not heard.  It was clear back on July 4, 1969, that I  finshed reading The Shadow of Blooming Grove / Warren G. Harding in His  Times, by Francis Russell, and I liked that book a lot, but yet some of the  revelations as to Harding in this book seemed new to me.  As one who  suffered thru the media's exhaustive coverage of our present President's  sins, I wished that the press of Harding's time had been as aciduous in  telling the truth about Harding.  Maybe the disastrous Republican hegemony  of the Twenties would have been alleviated some.  This book by Carl Anthony  is well worth your time if you have any interest in political history.  And  it does say good things about its subject, tho it is hard to find anything  admirable about her very weak and sinning husband.	2000-06-02

This is a really excellent book, and very straightforward in telling the  story of a skilled demagogue pandering to Arkansas' prejudices. It is a  most excellent account and I cannot see how it could have been done better.   Jeff Davis was elected  governor of Arkansas in 1900, 1902, and 1904 and  elected to the Senate for the term that began in 1907 and was reelected in  1912.  If you have read and enjoyed Pitchfork Ben Tillman: South  Carolinian, by Francis Butler Simkins, as I have, or The White Chief: James  Kimble Vardaman, by William F.

But the account of the years after 1930 is full of interest and the two chapters covering the  years from 1937 to 1947 are very touching.  This book is more defensive of  Baldwin than is his authorized biographer, and makes a good case that  Baldwin's course in those fateful years from 1933 to 1937 was  understandable, tho not prophetic.  I felt the way Baldwin was savaged  after 1939 was repulsive, especially when one remembers that Labor in those  years(1933 to 1937)was calling for disarmament and was rewarded for that  extremely short-sighted course by its stunning electoral victory in 1945.   I was glad I read this book, albeit it was not the easiest book to read.  A  momentous and worthwhile book.	2000-04-09

This book is filled with magnificent photographs of memorials in Belgium and France.  I read the whole thing, altho one ordinarily doesn't read a guidebook word for word.  After I read it I said :&quot;I now can probably save the expense of a tour of battlefields.  Included in the book is a  lesser known poem by John McCrae which starts out:    O Guns, fall silent  till the dead men hear    Above their heads the legions passing on!     (Those fought their fight in time of bitter fear,    And died not knowing  how the day had gone.)<br />   O flashing muzzles, pause, and let them see     The coming down that streaks the sky afar;    Then let your might chorus  witness be    To them, and Ceasar, that we still make war.<br />   Tell them,  O guns, that we have heard their call,    That we have sworn, and will not  turn aside,    That we will onward til we win or fall,    That we will keep  the faith for which they died.<br />   Bid them be patient, and someday, anon,     They shall feel earth enwrapt in silence deep,    Shall greet, in  wonderment, the quiet dawn,    And in content may turn them to their sleep.	2000-03-05

(I read Ron Chernov's Titan:  The Life of John D.

The financial aspects of Morgan's career seemed worth  reading to me, tho I suppose the book's account of them  is not as  informative as some could have made them.  I was repulsed by Morgan's  hypocritical disregard of the morality  he felt was important, apparently  for others only.	2000-02-24

My comment on finishing  volume 7 was &quot;I'd say about 5000 of the 6823 pages were really  interesting reading.&quot;  One of these days I want to find volume 8 and  read it so that I will have read the whole set.    Nor do I agree that this  work was what Professor Smith devoted his life to.  He has a two-volume  biography of John Adams which I am going to read some day, I hope.

Uris is not a great writer, but the story he tells in this book--I think it is his  first (and no doubt owes a lot to his own time in the Marines)--overcomes  his deficiencies as a writer.

In this book one can learn the youngest person ever named a Cardinal  (he was appointed, not in the 1400s, but in 1735!), and the youngest  cardinal ever in a conclave, and the last cardinal to be degraded and  executed.  But this is no National Enquirer type of book, but a meticulous  examination of a fascinating episode in Church History, even though  Innocenzo deservedly is forgotten today.

This covers the years so rapidly--from 11 May  330 to the Fall on 29 May 1453--that one doesn't get to know the  characters.  But it is fast-moving and the story it tells is a story seldom  told and one of amazing events.  The cruelty and murder, etc., that are so  prominent in the story seem unbelievable.  But the book is well-written. I  have not read the three volume work, but I should.	2000-01-08

But I found this absorbing reading.  Reading the 83 reviews on the board, I was surprised that so many  Marines are enticed by the account, but that is all right.  I myself think some of the psychological torture  inflicted on recruits cannot be necessary, and the book's indication of how  Army boot is run now seemed more sensible to me.  But it is satifying that  some of the physical abuse that apparently formerly was employed now is not  deemed necessary.  In other words, if you have read Lords of Discipline, by  Pat Conroy, (fiction, I know, but probably solidly based on the author's  time at The Citadel)it would seem some of the inhumanity is gone from  Marine and similar training and I doubt that is all bad.  I think my  reading this book will be meaningful to me for the rest of my life.	1999-12-06

I have just finished reading this book and the preceding two volumes.  This is very solid work, and if you appreciate, as I do, feeling that an  author has done good and careful research you will like these volumes.  I  have concluded that to really understand the Hitler period one must learn  more about the 19th century in Germany.  It seems to me that Bismarck, by  his brilliant defense of autocratic rule in Germany, helped make Hitler  possible. The footnotes in these volumes are where they are supposed to  be--at the foot of each page--but it is regrettable that there is no  bibliography as such.	1999-10-23

Sammler is a nice guy, in contradistinction to most other central characters of Bellow's novels,  but nevertheless I was awfully bored by this book.

This is a great human interest story, damningly enlightening on what daily life was for a &quot;lucky&quot; Jew  in Germany during the Nazi era.  I will certainly read the second volume,  covering the years 1942 to 1945, when it is published this year.  In fact I  would like to read all he wrote during the years he was forced not to be  able to work from 1935, when he lost his professorship because he was a  Jew, till 1945.

For much of the time I was reading I thought it inartfully written, the story line awfully contrived, and often boring.  But there is a certain power to  the story, and it depicts good people--John Ashley, above all--who should  be admired.  I guess I am  glad I read this book,  but I can't say I think  it is felicitously written.  I concluded the award of the National Book  Award to this book was more to honor an old and famous writer than because  the book is a great book.	1999-06-11

I have certainly not read anything so poignant on Vietnam  since Fortunate Son, The Autobiography of Lewis B. Puller, Jr., which I  finished on Feb 6, 1994.

I appreciated his view on Gandhi, as a good antidote to the hagiographical view so often expressed.  (I have  always had reservations about a man who thought the thing to do was drink  his own urine!)  But I found the footnotes in this book next to useless--I  have seldom seen footnotes so non-revealing.  Sometimes the name given in  the footnote was not in the bibliography.

Dec. 6, 1921,  is the date the Irish delegates signed the  Treaty--the Irish Civil War came in July 1922 and is beyond the scope of  this book.

His chapters on Webster's great orations make Webster's words  come alive.

The apparitions were never accepted by an official Church study--tho never publicly condemned by any bishop.  It is a fascinating account, and  even though this is a very balanced book, I found myself attracted to the  people who believed in the validity of the visions.  The heavy-handed  effforts of Bismarck's Kulterkampf to stifle the innocent faith of the  believers was part of what attracted me.  The visionaries all went into  convents, and did not live long.  The main one made a written  retraction--which was not made public at the time.  This is a very  carefully researched, heavily-footnoted book, and certainly a classic on  the subject.  There is a multi-page bibliography, listing many books which I  would like to read.	1998-12-13

It is an awful and nauseous book, telling of  Rodney Dangerfield, an American in Ireland and England, who is immoral,  blasphemous, and extremely uninteresting.  I was sure glad to get to the  last page.  The blurb on the jacket from Time says Donleavy makes the  reader love Dangerfield for his killer instinct, flamboyant charm, wit,  flashing generosity--and above all for his wild, fierce, two-handed grab  for every precious second of life.  This is all false, IMHO--I despised him  and thought he was a stupid, asinine bore who did revolting things.	1998-10-25

It is a  real novel--ittells a story, it has a beginning, it develops, it has a  searing ending.  It is not riddled with obscenities, nor is it  sex-saturaated.  It tells the story of two rich Montana ranchowners, Phil  and George Burbank. Phil is intelligent and cruel, expert and hate-filled  toward what he disagrees with.  George, his brother, is simple,  slow-thinking--marries a widow whom Phil despisesand is cruel to. so she  takes to drink.  Her son, Peter, is the son of her first husband, a doctor  who killed himself.  The book is expertly written, and seems authentic to  Montana ranch life.  Savage was born in 1915 in Salt Lake City, spent his  youth on a working ranch in Montana, was a U of Montana one year, graduated  from Colby College in Maine.  He taught at Vassar and Brandeis and in 1967  lived on the Maine coast.  I think he is still alive--I first heard of him  when I read about him and Louise Erdrcich in the LeMars library a couple of  weeks ago.  This book has been compelling and meaningful. I recommend it  unreservedly.	1998-09-07

It is  written by a greatniece of Mary Phagan, who was  murdered in Atlanta on Apr. 26, 1913.  It quotes a lot of the trial  documentation, and the governor's commutation statement, and so it was  interesting as a crime account.  But I really could not empathize withe the  author's resistance to a pardon for Leo Frank, tho his guilt seems clearly  not psychologically indicated.  In fact the author's father refuses to  condemn the lynching.  The book is not an inspiring one.	1998-09-07

So I have  read some 1500 pages of Green since he died.  Some of the things in this  book were annoying, but if one looks at the whole as painting a picture I  believe one can see a reason for the sometimes tedious detail.  His  characters sure do a lot of kissing, and apparently the central character  and  her husband were more uxorious than the usual fictional characters,  which is saying quite a bit.	1998-09-06

Its format is superlative.  There is chronology in the front to guide one to the life, and the footnotes are where they belong--on the bottom of the page, so one does not have to go to the back of the book, only to find that footnote is just a page citation.

I finished Peter Kurth's book on 24 Oct 1983 and said to myself that I knew as much about Anastasia as it is reasonably possible to know.  Well, this book is very poor on the years covered by Kurth's book, but very good on the period after Anna Anderson married Jack Manahan on Dec 23, 1968.  They led an eccentric life--their home in Charlottesville, Va., was a  total mess.  She died Feb 12, 1984 and Jack died Mar 22, 1990.  He was always odd, and did crazy thing.  A large section of the book tells of the author's effort to determine if there was a fifth daughter, born in 1903, which was gotten away from the Czar and Czarina and raised by a Dutch couple.  The author of the book is very much convinced Anastasia was Anna Anderson--and in fact this makes the book less convincing.  The book does not cover anything that has been learned since the caollapse of the Soviet Union and the DNA tests indicating all the family died at Ekaterinber! g.  This was not a good book but it was interesting reading, and told some new things.	1998-07-19
