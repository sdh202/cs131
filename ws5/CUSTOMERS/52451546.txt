Jung on Nature, Technology & Modern Life	Books	5	102	105	N	Y	An amazing collection	I wished for years to see what Jung wrote about the natural world and our relationship with it in one volume that would spare me the hassle of going through the Index to the entire Collected Works.  This is that book.  Check out the Table of Contents (click on the book logo above to see it) to get an idea of how clearly organized this book is.  I use it in graduate courses for Jung and ecopsych students.  Highly recommended.	2005-09-18
74367:US	52451546	R1OBPUZH1IAJS2	0060438355	189180443	2: Perspectives in Western Civilization: Volume 1	Books	4	1	1	N	N	definitely worth having	A keeper indeed, as the reviewer mentioned; an outstanding collection of essays on various aspects of Western civilization as examined through a variety of people and perspectives.  Topics include Cervantes's Spain, Rousseau, Queen Victoria, the much-misunderstood Sir Isaac Newton (if Blake had to attack anyone, he should have picked on Descartes instead:  Newton despised the clockwork model of Creation), a piece on Nelson's victory in the Battle of the Nile, Charles Darwin (from whom the term \\"survival of the fittest\\" did NOT originate), Leon Trotsky's rise and fall...<br /><br />The scholars selected for this anthology write clearly, vividly, and in places dramatically.  No heavy citations or footnotes:  instead, gripping narratives of the people and events that have forged the history and development of the West.  I would have liked to see more essays by and about women, however, and by and about pivotal non-white individuals.  The book is plainly white Euro, which is a shame because it's an otherwise excellent set of selections.  Wish list for future editions:  pieces on Susan B. Anthony, Mary Shelley, Malcolm X, the Islamic contribution to Western arts and sciences.	2005-09-04

Grant : Memoirs and Selected Letters : Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant / Selected Letters, 1839-1865 (Library of America)	Books	5	22	23	N	N	the words of a pivotal American	In 1885, Samuel Clemens convinced Grant, who was wallowing in debt from a failed business deal and seeing a doctor for a chronic sore throat, to write his memoirs.  This he did, and this book also contains selected letters and a chronology of Grant's life.  Grant finished the book (two volumes, both included here) in great pain and promptly gave up the ghost.<br /><br />You will not find a more objective narrator.  No childish good guys and bad guys, heroes and evildoers for Grant.  Rigorously but fairly pointing out the weaknesses in his opponents, and sometimes in the generals he served with (Halleck is notorious), Grant never fails to mention their strong points as well.  For example, of his colleague Ewell, later a Confederate general, Grant notes, \\"He was a man much esteemed, and deservedly so, in the old army, and proved himself a gallant and efficient officer in two wars--both in my estimation unholy.\\"  He refers to the Mexican War and the Southern Rebellion.<br /><br />There is something awesome about Grant's objectivity and bravery in the field.  Horses having been shot out from under him, comrades felled nearby, his sword broken by a Confederate bullet, he notes simply that in his time, it's the duty of generals to be shot at.  War is not a poem of glory to Grant.  It is a grisly business, often propelled by paranoid ideologies, to be gotten through as quickly and efficiently as possible.  The sight of entire hillsides covered with bodies did not cure him of romantic notions of battle because he never possessed any to begin with.  The reader may well suspect him of being what people call an old soul, someone who knew, even when young, that below all medals and monuments and patriotic justifications lie heaps of forgotten corpses.<br /><br />If Grant could be said to possess any weakness that influenced his accounts, it would be an excessive modesty similar to that which confined him to wearing a private's uniform (he had a lifelong fear of being castigated for looking too good in uniform).  The facts and backgrounds of his doings are plainly stated, and in the solid, plain-spoken, sturdy prose which Clemens admired, but they seldom point out the historical significance of Grant's actions outside the immediate military context--for unlike MacArthur and Patton, Grant was no narcissist.  Every promotion found him doubtful, reluctant, and obedient to the core in terms of his interpretation of his duty.<br /><br />Grant's inability to see through the scoundrels that gathered around him during the Presidency evidently did not apply to his role as a military commander.  He was clear, for example, that the Mexican war was one of deliberately provoked imperialism.  \\"The Mexican war was a political war, and the administration conducting it desired to make party capital out of it.\\"  (Sounds familiar, except that needing to provoke hostilities, as Polk sought to do, is no longer necessary.  And yet:  \\"...the man who obstructs a war in which his nation is engaged, no matter whether right or wrong, occupies no enviable place in life or history.\\")<br /><br />Interestingly, Grant maintains that the Civil War was largely an outgrowth of the Mexican War:  \\"Nations, like individuals, are punished for their transgressions.  We got our punishment in the most sanguinary and expensive war of modern times.\\"  One wonders whether this lesson, if it be such, will ever be learned off the battlefield.igated for looking too good in uniform).

Books	4	12	13	N	N	clear and sensible	I like the clear explanations in this book, accompanied by helpful illustrations, tips, and bits and pieces from the author's extensive gardening experience.  I've used some of the techniques in combination with French intensive methods that do require an initial double-digging, and the loose, aerated soil of raised beds makes no-tool planting and weed control easy.<br /><br />I do think the way this book is marketed is problematic--starting with the cover:  \\"A New Layering System....\\"  As the author herself points out, the system is sheet composting combined with a no-till approach.  Nothing new there.  And although the \\"no digging, no tilling, no weeding\\" is true, or mostly true, the organic material needed to make a four-foot-by-ten bed raised 24\\" has to come from somewhere.  Again, the author notes this, but the advertising makes it all seem effortless--which indeed it is if you don't mind spending a fortune on peat moss (a vanishing resource--buy coconut coir instead), amendments, and imported soil.  The advantage of double-digging is that the soil is already there waiting for you.  Alas, authors have very little say in how their books are marketed.<br /><br />This one is very easy to read; the author did a fine job of showing how she works.	2005-08-05

This important book examines that notion through the impact of several historically key men on North America.<br /><br />They include Samuel de Champlain, whose missionizing and choosing up sides in various Indian wars set the stage for \\"the most widespread and destructive warfare in North American history\\"; William Penn, whose sincere efforts to coexist peacefully with the Indians degenerated into the unapologetic expansionism of his heirs; George Washington, who foresaw so many of the dangers of military intervention abroad; the tempestuous and bullying Andrew Jackson, who owned slaves, relocated thousands of Indians west of the Mississippi, and set the stage for ongoing wars of conquest in the name of freedom and liberty (and who had the gall to argue that relocating the Indians was \\"not only liberal, but generous\\"); Ulysses Grant, reluctant participant in the land-grabbing war with Mexico, a man who clearly understood that such aggressive moves always bring punishing consequences; the grandstanding Douglas MacArthur, aging momma's boy and self-appointed missionary of Christianity and liberty, finally relieved of command by Truman for suggesting that the United States nuke China; and Colin Powell, whose highly distinguished military career ran parallel with a habit of doing what he was told while silencing his doubts--doubts that nearly always turned out to be realistically based.  \\"I had been conditioned to believe in the wisdom of my superiors....\\"<br /><br />The authors of this book tell a balanced tale without heavy-handed recourse to the lessons unlearned from history, but the lessons stand out anyway:  the conquest of the Phillipines, for example, so many of whose citizens died in the American attempt to liberate them in a bloody, exhausting campaign that only ended when the occupation did.  Concentration camps and torture inflicted by MacArthur's soldiers stained these attempts to mold a nation's fate from above, as did Roosevelt's propagandistic declaration that the insurrection was over (July 4, 1902) when in fact it would not end for many years.<br /><br />A poignant event might well give food for thought:  Woodrow Wilson's 1916 draft of a speech to Congress, which stated that \\"it shall not lie with American people to dictate to another people what their government shall be or what use they shall have or what persons they shall encourage or favor.\\"  Reviewing the speech, Secretary of State Robert Lansing wrote:  \\"Haiti, S. Domingo, Nicaragua, Panama\\" in the margin by way of comment (he might have added Cuba, Mexico, and the Phillipines), whereupon Wilson gave up on the speech, a decision that may well mark a significant difference between the politics of his time and our own.licted by MacArthur's soldiers stained these attempts to mold a nation's fate from above, as did Roosevelt's propagandistic declaration that the insurrection was over (July 4, 1902) when in fact it would not end for many years. <br /> <br />A poignant event might well give food for thought:  Woodrow Wilson's 1916 draft of a speech to Congress, which stated that \\"it shall not lie with American people to dictate to another people what their government shall be or what use they shall have or what persons they shall encourage or favor.\\"  Reviewing the speech, Secretary of State Robert Lansing wrote:  \\"Haiti, S.

Working through the metaphor of Chaucer's famous pilgrimage, he leads us back in time to our evolutionary antecedents, the while providing clear explanations and interesting and amusing anecdotes.  He also takes the time to debunk some of the more common misconceptions about evolutionary theory:  that it leans heavily on fossil record data, for instance, or that it amounts to supposing that a hurricane could blow through a room and happen to knock together a 747:  a convenient overlooking of the minor matter of long-term selection and other gradual forces.<br /><br />The only distraction for me was the author's tone when discussing people he disagrees with:  for the most part Creationists who distort scientific findings to support their faith-based arguments, although he also knocked environmentalists like me as \\"airheads\\" for believing in a correspondence between breathing forests and working lungs.  The professor has a habit of going beyond the issues to get personal, and it's snooty enough to make the psychologically educated reader wonder just who he's really going after, strafing away at times with the aggressive persistence of the fighter jets he says recur in his dreams.  I think a day will dawn when that level of reductionist striking from above must wonder whether it too displays a disconcerting tendency toward what Jung would have seen as projection of the shadow.<br /><br />All in all, however, I greatly enjoyed the book and was very interested to learn so much that I had not seen in other books on the topic.	2005-04-06

Raff's important book goes a long way toward filling this depth-psychological gap by applying what he calls psychoidal alchemy, a perspective that moves our understanding of figures like Sophia beyond the realm of the exclusively psychic.<br /><br />By doing this the author shifts the emphasis from the purely human to the transhuman.  Describing the understanding of personality in terms of an earlier stage of the alchemical opus, he explains that \\"Sophia is not asking you to understand her in terms of your life, but to understand her in terms of hers\\"--a point that nudges the imagination out of egocentricity into something more like an ecology.<br /><br />The author does a fine job overall of sticking close to his own experiences and to the images made available through his scholarship.  This is clearly a book written by someone who cares very deeply about the subject.	2005-02-19

There's only one thing wrong with this book:  it's not long enough!  Not that it's small (308 pages), but the excerpts from people of many different faiths, philosophies, even sciences are only a page or two long.<br /><br />Even so, they are well-chosen.  The book takes you on an excursion of how people find a sense of the sacred in various places, most of them outdoors but some in other places too (like temples).  There are Christians in here, Buddhists, Muslims, Jains, nature writers, scientists, novelists....it's quite a marvelous collection, from Ibn 'Arabi to Thomas Berry to N. Scott Momaday.<br /><br />I'm not sure \\"collection\\" is the word I want; reading this felt more like receiving a gift.  The quotations were so moving that I immediately placed two of them (Ralph Waldo Emerson, Edward Abbey) on the front page of my Web site.<br /><br />Here is one from Hildegard of Bingen, a true Renaissance woman before there was a Renaissance; she is giving voice to the \\"greening\\" (veriditas) force that animates the world:<br /><br />\\"All these live because I am in them and am of their life.  I am wisdom.  Mine is the blast of the thundered word by which all things were made.  I permeate all things that they may not die.  I am life.\\"<br /><br />And this from someone more contemporary:  Stephanie Kaza, describing the interplay between the natural world and the Buddha's moment of enlightenment there under the fig tree:<br /><br />\\"For seven days and seven nights he sat in meditation, supported by the tree.  During the seventh night he was tormented by every possible distraction of the mind...To counter the force of ignorance, he touched his right hand to the earth.  With the earth and tree as witness, the powerful realization of interdependence was revealed.\\"	2005-01-10

Annie Dillard has been widely recognized as one of the finest prose stylists writing in the English language.  She confirms her reputation in this beautiful book, movingly written and organized around the theme of human greatness (and smallness) in the face of transience.  \\"We live in all we seek,\\" and, \\"What a hideout:  Holiness lies spread and borne over the surface of time and stuff like color\\" are two of the many quotable sentences in this book.  The pieces on Teilhard de Chardin, the scientist-priest hobbled hand and foot by Rome, are particularly moving.<br /><br />Like a previous reviewer, however, I was surprised she had not moved much beyond positions set out in her earlier books, especially the exemplary HOLY THE FIRM.  Maybe it's just me, but I find myself increasingly impatient with the \\"why is God silent\\" question, as though the Almighty ought to be personally managing affairs down here.  Sartre's question comes to mind:  asked where God was during WW II, Sartre replied, \\"Where was man?\\"<br /><br />I was also surprised to learn that the author does not consider herself an environmentalist or nature writer--until I read this book, that is.  Pointing out that the people of other historical periods considered themselves in an apocalyptic time, she makes fun of our end-of-days preoccupations:  \\"People have made great strides in obliterating other people, too, but that has been the human effort all along...New diseases, shifts in power, floods!  Can the people of dynastic Egypt have been any different?\\"<br /><br />To this question, which ignores the fact of our contemporary capacity to obliterate just about everything (83% of the planet surface has been interfered with, 1/3 of its corral reefs are gone, 50% of the animals are headed into history, etc.), I would counterpose the opening paragraph of LISTENING TO THE LAND (available here at Amazon.com) edited by Derrick Jensen:<br /><br />\\"We are members of the most destructive culture ever to exist.  Our assault on the natural world, on indigenous and other cultures, on women, on children, on all of us through the possibility of nuclear suicide and other means--all these are unprecedented in their magnitude and ferocity.  Why do we act as we do?\\"<br /><br />Offhand, I would say that makes our situation somewhat different than that of dynastic Egypt.ur assault on the natural world, on indigenous and other cultures, on women, on children, on all of us through the possibility of nuclear suicide and other means--all these are unprecedented in their magnitude and ferocity.

Dostoevsky's question:  what would be the impact of a man without guile, the ostensible Christian ideal?<br /><br />As I read I couldn't help thinking about the innocence and denial so rampant in American culture nowadays.  \\"Teddybearism,\\" James Hillman calls it, referring to the mountain of stuffed animals sent to the remains of the World Trade Center.  Not even the boldest and most Machiavellian maneuvers of the inadequately opposed theocracy now gathering power to itself in Washington can convince nearly 50% of Americans that relentless warfare, poverty, invasion of privacy, and environmental destruction have nothing to do with freedom, security, or patriotism.  It's so bad now that Americans are posing abroad as Canadians to avoid the most embarrassing questions about all the reckless, ignorant, bow-legged posturing to make the world safer for Freedom Fries.<br /><br />Prince Myshkin is not an American, but he is a card-carrying teddybearist.  Lie to him and he'll probably believe it.  Tell him an unpleasant truth about someone and he'll see only the good in them.  He exemplifes the feel-good philosophy of \\"always look on the bright side.\\"  And the result?  He surrounds himself with losers, liars, cheaters, drunks, and at least one killer, even passing up the chance to marry the woman he loves to wed a raving lunatic.<br /><br />Those interested in the negative impact of too much pure-heartedness will find this book an interesting study--and a validation of psychologist Rollo May's dictum that an innocence which blinds itself to the power of the daimonic in man becomes demonic in its effects.	2004-12-09

Not as a missionary out to \\"improve,\\" \\"evolve,\\" or Christianize the natives, or to sell them slicker TV sets; not to study them like infusoria under a microscope; not to turn their gods into meteorology; but to listen, deeply, into the patterns of their life and language, and then--strictly by invitation within that community--to create a thing of beauty that casts a circle of illumination over what had remained hidden in the shadows cast by the mainstream.<br /><br />In Chimayo, New Mexico, that emissary is Chellis Glendinning.<br /><br />At one time Chimayo ranked #1 in drug overdoses in a state (New Mexico) that also ranked first in this grim category.  This book is a story--personal, cultural, wrenching, hard to read in places because disturbing in its detail--of how the Chicanos and Mexicanos of Chimayo went back to their cultural roots to push the dealers out of their town, then apply the wisdom of those roots to healing the victims of the dragon Chiva, \\"heroin.\\"<br /><br />The use of \\"roots\\" is deliberate, because as the author makes clear, the drug problem is a product of a long tradition of colonial expansion and devastation in which a land-based people have been globalized, exploited, and thrust into poverty on soils their ancestors once cultivated and loved.  From out of that soil came the remedies to combat sniffed, smoked, and injected poisons which users employ to forget for a moment that they are poor; that they have few options and scarce employment; that they are seen by the culture that has alienated them as aliens.<br /><br />Whence this black-market plague of Thebes?

What I could have taken heart (not the pump) from, and what Robert Romanyshyn provides in this book, is what he calls \\"a psychological reading of the historical appearance of the science of psychology.\\"  A psychological reading:  a reading that takes psyche on its own terms and disassembles psychological empiricism into a series of working fantasies, a dream too often untended as such.<br /><br />Using the metaphor of the mirror, Romanyshyn brings into his study a sustained reflection in which the reflected-upon and the reflecter transform one another.  This mirrorlike dissolving of watcher into watched, which eludes captivity in numbers or in graphs depicted in psychology texts, cannot be called a property of psyche, for psyche is not a thing or a substance.  \\"Between persons and things, man and world, subject and object, a story appears, a story which is expressed in terms of a way of seeing and speaking about the world.  The story which appears is the appearance of psychological life.\\"<br /><br />What does a psychology offer when it has forgotten this storied quicksilver aspect of its subject?  Automata; a subject without subjectivity; or as the author puts it, an animated corpse.  Read a mainstream psych text and see for yourself:  drives and their derivatives, but no person; mechanisms and libidinal hydraulics, but no soul.  Spiritless schemata whose vocabulary might have been dried in formaldehyde before ever hitting the page.<br /><br />As one of archetypal psychology's original thinkers, the author points out that behind the most \\"objective\\" observation lurks a fantasy, an image; and perhaps nowhere is this truer, and with larger psychological consequences, than in psychology itself.  \\"Psychology, however, forgets this vision.  Focusing on the events of physiology as the facts of psychology, it forgets that these events are primarily ways of seeing psychological life.  Focusing on what it sees, it forgets how it sees.  And in this forgetfulness what originally matters metaphorically is taken literally.\\"<br /><br />What always strikes me about Romanyshyn's work (see my review of his book THE SOUL IN GRIEF here at Amazon.com) is how vibrantly relational its own metaphors are.  They image, connect, dream into each other, now at rest, now in motion, but never static or sealed in glass jars.  Loosening itself from the customary constructs we bring to it, the world he paints for us shimmers into enactments, poetics, that dance around the details he shows us:  the face in the mirror, the old man in the park.

If he felt any connection to the land underfoot, he did not articulate it in this collection of dates, letters, and foundings of clubhouses, golf courses, and polo fields.  Why he wrote the book is unclear, for it comes to an unsentimentally linear account devoid of story, emotion, or anecdote.  The subtitle might have been, \\"Turning a Former Rancho Into Real Estate.\\"  Fortunately, the area under study, though now gated and guarded, remains lush and vibrantly alive.	2004-11-11

This translation starts with the text (it reads like a series of revelations and parables steeped in biblical quotations) followed by the depth-psychological commentary of von Franz.  Of all the second-generation Jungians, perhaps only Edward Edinger matches her in clarity.  In brilliance no one does.<br /><br />Quite a few Jungians of my acquaintance haven't read this book even though it was intended as a supplement to Jung's MYSTERIUM CONIUNCTIONIS, the last of his longer works and his last word on the relationship between alchemy and the unconscious.  Perhaps it's because the book is not an alchemical treatise; it is, as the commentator notes in an introduction, a rush of revelation by a man who resorted to both Christian and alchemical symbolism to come to grips with what must have been an overpowering confrontation with the numen--in this case Sophia, the Gnostic goddess of Wisdom and, in the Old Testament, the feminine counterpart to God.<br /><br />As I read, however, I found myself continually distracted by the damnable Jungian habit of footnoting everything (a dozen per page) as well as by the commentator's inability to write one page without quoting Jung:  a sad and unfortunate habit given her obvious wealth of knowledge and psychological depth.  It's clear too that she did an enormous amount of theological and alchemical research and, I suspect, furnished Jung with a fair bulk of what showed up in his tomes on the art of alchemy.<br /><br />Although this doesn't count against the book's commentary, this doctor of depth psychology finds himself wondering why none of the psychological interpretations take Sophia, the metals, and the Earth at their word.  Again and again, references to the aliveness of these substances are interpreted as the alchemist's projection onto matter.  But what if the alchemist wasn't projecting?d as the alchemist's projection onto matter.  But what if the alchemist wasn't projecting?	2004-09-01

The author struck a compromise between rewriting the original archaic English (the Steinbeck solution, unfinished, alas) and leaving it alone by cleaning it up a bit while including some of the original terms, with translations in the margins (\\"skift\\":  rid).  As the intro mentions, the book isn't a scholarly excursion, it's a retelling of the old great tales.<br /><br />At first I was going to rate this book a 4 because many of the illustrations are too small to see in any detail.  The color plates work well--they are reproductions of medieval images that really give color to the stories around them--but the black-and-whites in the margins are so tiny that even the captions don't help you see what's going on in them.  They should have been redone or omitted altogether.  And then I opened the book to the very first page, and when I saw a tiny color plate of Arthur's crowning looking so blurred and even misaligned, I thought:  this crappy cut and paste just won't do.  So I gave it a 3 instead.<br /><br />I'd like to see the book reissued with better artwork.  The reading is easy and enjoyable.	2004-08-11

Archetypal psychology has lacked an exploration of war and its deeper dimensions.  This clearly written book not only fills the breach, it invites the reader to look into the heart of war:  into the destruction, the religious fascination, and even the love that permeate warfare.  Topics under discussion include the media role in aggression; accounts spoken and written by soldiers under fire; the mythic structures behind the American fascination with guns; and what psychology and philosophy have had to say about one of the oldest human pastimes--all in sparkling prose and flavored with anecdotes and examples.<br />To Christian readers I would recommend considering Hillman's view that Christianity has been martial from the start as a challenge to examine the relationship between the Christian emphasis on love and innocence and its long institutional history of intolerance and brutality.  Is warfare endemic to Christianity?  Are Christians who reject warfare exceptions to an almost universal aggressiveness?  Must Christianity be a religion of missionaries who think they know better than the peoples they seek to convert?  These are some of the questions raised by Hillman's study.<br />Hillman also brings new emphasis to a heavily underrated factor in American aggression:  hypocrisy.  How is it that we select as leaders (and do adults really need leaders to begin with?  Indigenous cultures got on fine with wise elders and mentors) the most insincere and immature among us?  Why is it (as Aaron Kipnis puts it) an old boy's club instead of a gathering of wise old men?  What does it do to us, these deceptive speeches and these Orwellian justifications (war for peace; &quot;democracy&quot; from the top down; &quot;pre-emptions&quot; that precede nothing but endless cycles of violence)?  And from the therapist's point of view:  how does living in a nation addicted to unending warfare and cheap, finger-pointing patriotism impact the work we do with our clients?<br />Hillman's archetypalizing of warfare by bringing it home to the altar of Mars is an elegant move, but for me it always raises the concern:  are we eternalizing something that ought to be analyzed as a cultural institution?  In a book I'm preparing for publication (The Tears of Llorona; look for it here at Amazon.com around late July or early August 2004) I cite recent research by archeologist R. Brian Ferguson that the evidence for organized warfare only goes back as far as organized civilization.  Hillman is correct to dwell on the archetypal aspects--a &quot;ta'wil&quot; move of bringing something back to its ultimate foundations--and while he never makes this a &quot;war is inevitable&quot; justification for armed aggression, I'm wondering if the social-economic-cultural aspect, which he's clearly aware of, needs more mention.<br />In a recent discussion at the Pacifica Graduate Institute, Hillman told me about how it was to visit the Civil War battlefields he mentions in his book.  I was moved to see how deeply he felt about what for him is not a merely academic or intellectual interest.  &quot;The blood of our brothers cries out from the land,&quot; he said, and although he agreed with my phrasing it as &quot;the return of the historically repressed,&quot; he did the subject much dearer justice by cohering so closely to the experience as it struck him.rchetypalizing of warfare by bringing it home to the altar of Mars is an elegant move, but for me it always raises the concern:  are we eternalizing something that ought to be analyzed as a cultural institution?

The author has done his homework, but he also goes well beyond the mere facts and dates to listen carefully into the images, motifs, and themes of London's past and present, and this makes the book immensely valuable as a deeper-than-usual resource into the &quot;soul&quot; of a place the author obviously loves despite its shadows and ugly spots.	2004-05-19

The film GETTYSBURG comes to mind, but stripped of all the &quot;why we fight&quot; rahrah.<br />Those who read history know that by the early 1800s, Napoleon had captured most of Europe.  Only the discipline and seamanship of the Royal Navy had kept him from swallowing all of it.  In his grandiosity he lined up his next target, fabled Moscow, sent in the army, burned the city; but Russia was the rock upon which his Grand Armee shattered.  By the time it ran back to France, most of its vitality lay dying in the Russian winter.  That's the historical context of the novel.<br />For me the start was a slow read--all those balls and drawing rooms and Russian high society--but only until realizing that Tolstoy was setting the stage, introducing key characters, and making an ironic contrast between the insulated world of the nobility and the blood and death that would soon pierce it.<br />What stood out most for me:  people and events.  What a gallery of people:  the parasitic Anna Mihalovna and her insipid son Boris; the callous Don Juanism of Anatole; his psychopathic friend Dolohov; Sonya, clever but faded; the unstoppable Denisov, the Wobin Hood of Wussia (&quot;Weload!&quot;); Prince Andrei, fated for a moment of battlefield transcendence in which even Napoleon seems paltry and limited; girlish Natasha; and Pierre, living proof of William Blake's dictum that excess can lead to wisdom.<br />In charge of the Russian army:  Field Marshal Kutuzov, as weary and patient as the ground he defended.  The clever and enduring peasant Karatayev might serve as his spiritual counterpart, the first an exemplar of the Russian heart, the second a bearer of its soul.<br />The ball where the nobility dance as Napoleon quietly crosses the border; the burning of Moscow; and the terrible carnage as Prince Andrei's men are knocked to pieces one by one in a fog torn by incoming artillery fire:  just three of many poignant, wracking, and unforgettable events in this vast tapestry whose human threads weave their way in and out of what for us is history.<br />A few critiques:<br />My edition of this translation could stand updating.  I don't read Russian, but I can't visualize Russians using words like &quot;fiddlesticks,&quot; &quot;blackguard,&quot; or &quot;at sixes and sevens.&quot;<br />The book's most obvious artistic flaw is all the pages it devotes to the grinding of Tolstoy's history ax.  At least he put most of it in the Epilogue.  An aspect of his view has been called Tolstoy's fatalism:  wars and other big events don't happen because of heroes or geniuses or bad guys, but because power relations within and between societies make them inevitable.  Napoleon no more &quot;chose&quot; to attack Moscow with insufficient supplies than Kutuzov &quot;chose&quot; to hold his ground at Borodino.  Even so, such determinism, &quot;Russian fatalism,&quot; or whatever the reader chooses to call it also serves to polish and brighten the flaws, foibles, choices, and losses of the richly drawn characters, whose strivings are ennobled and illuminated by the darkness of the social forces gripping them.<br />What stands forth clearly in his epic is that the forces of life shine on another scale of magnitude altogether and are, in the end, as proof against final eclipse as the Russian soil in which this masterpiece germinated.y incoming artillery fire:  just three of many poignant, wracking, and unforgettable events in this vast tapestry whose human threads weave their way in and out of what for us is history.<br />A few critiques:<br />My edition of this translation could stand updating.

Deft use of quotations from journals, letters, and interviews brings to life not only Horney herself as she moves through the stages of her life, but the historical background in which she taught, analyzed, loved, and struggled to trust the voice (in Carol Gilligan's sense of that word) which even Freud tried to disparage, emanating as it did from a woman--or as many of Horney's opponents were forced to acknowledge, from THAT woman.<br />Horney, a brilliant analyst, did stupid things on occasion, as all of us do.  She could be impatient, unempathic, and impulsive.  Her cheery humanistic view of human nature may have led her at times to underestimate what Jung called the shadow side of psyche.  Nevertheless, the impact and originality of her ideas inspired generations of analysts and sympathetic readers all over the world.  She refused to keep silent in the face of dissent, and thousands, perhaps millions, of us are the better for her courage.<br />The author mentions that Horney had a gift for inspiring the feeling, &quot;She's talking about me!&quot;  More than twenty years ago, I picked up a book more or less at random one day, read it, and have been training in psychology--my own therapy, BA, MS, and now PhD--ever since.  The book was Karen Horney's SELF-ANALYSIS.  This fine biography helped me understand more about the analyst who stood by spiritually at the start of my own vocation.	2004-01-20

I didn't see in this book that characters were out of character or that the plot or whatnot had problems.  Archie is his usual capable smartass self, and Wolfe's diction and grammar remain laser-precise (to use a metaphor he would scorn).  The difference from the other novels is that this one has a somber note, and it sounded from Stout's deep disappointment with Watergate.  (Wolfe fans know of his respect for words:  &quot;somber&quot; goes back to a near-identical French word that means &quot;grave.&quot;)  Stout was thinking about issues of patriotism and betrayal when he penned this novel, and it shows.  It should.  Nixon was given control of the ship of state, and while steering it he indulged in wrecklessness and flummery.<br />Wolfe does break some of his cherished rules; but can't we allow him to in Archie's last report of his doings?  And he breaks them because the case is &quot;a family affair.&quot;  His self-esteem, as large as his fabled seventh of a ton, has been tweaked.  A murder has happened in his own home--and, twice as indigestible, the victim is mighty Nero's own waiter at Rusterman's.  He requires satisfaction and will halt his planetary momentum at nothing--not even jail time--to get it.<br />Being a male chauvinist lookalike, as Saul Panzer would have it (and not just a lookalike, unfortunately), Archie's machismo could never allow him to comment at length on how he felt about where the investigation led.  His lapses say it for him.  A question implicit in what he and Wolfe discover is:  how does one come to terms with finding betrayal where one expected sincerity?  It can be an anguishing question, and the stylish solution devised by &quot;the family&quot; leaves behind it both a mystery solved but a lesson learned about the need to be critical of those who claim to uphold the law of the land.	2004-01-15

He wrote dozens of novels and stories, and that shows up in the depth of his characterizations and the almost Shakespearian neatness of each scene.  On that level the book is entertaining, witty, clever, alluring, and thoughtful.<br />It is also a novel of poignant moments.  As Leto reviews his lost humanity and thrashes about, his fanatical Fish Speaker guards overhear him.  &quot;The Lord is troubled tonight,&quot; one comments.  The other replies, &quot;The problems of this universe would trouble anyone.&quot;  Leto overhears them, and weeps.<br />His justifications for an all-female army to the macho Duncan are priceless, if rather biological, and the scene with the Tleilaxu ambassador priceless.<br />Previous readers (and reviewers) have wondered:  what exactly is the Golden Path?  I won't spoil the mystery, but I will mention this:  its outcome is Siona, and what she leaves to her descendants.<br />Leto's tyranny is troubling.  Like all tyrants, he insists on its necessity for the good of the people.  That it does in fact open up the Secher Nibw still leaves us with the dilemma of a being formerly human but mutated into something else, and dominated by a past personality (Harum) known as a ruthless autocrat.  But one we pity for his isolation and aloneness and the lost humanity that comes with every predatory occupation.  &quot;Your failure&quot; (he accuses the Bene Gesserrit in a later book) &quot;condemned me, the 'God Emperor,' to millennia of personal despair.&quot;<br />Yet even he has his moments of kindness and even love--and gratitude, as when he replies to a question about whether his Golden Path might fail:  &quot;Anyone and anything can fail, but good brave friends help.&quot;	2004-01-15

If every help manual in the world were written in such a style, we could all follow the directions, no doubt about it.

At the same time, however, it's strange to read suggestions about therapy or counseling without seeing any of the author's background in these disciplines.  Was Wilber trained by therapists?  Has he actually sat with clients and received supervision from therapists?  Listened as a group of colleagues told him about his own countertransference issues?  I don't know.  Perhaps he has.  I hope so.  Because work on yourself isn't enough to make you knowledgeable about psychotherapy--just as meditations on the nature of horseness don't make you an expert on dressage.<br />Wilber does some of the homework in terms of theory, but the real grist, the give-and-take of actual case histories, actual in-session learnings, knowledge of the analytic literature, accounts of the mistakes all trainees make in session, notes on dealing with fighting couples or self-destructive families:  where is it?  Because without it, degree or no degree, we are scarcely in a position to write adequately about psychotherapy, let alone recommend modifications to how it is performed by seasoned practitioners who every day get their hands and hearts dirty with genuine human conflict and tragedy, illness and death.	2004-01-15

At this point nobody in the field is shocked to hear about the Founding Fathers having sex with their patients, however inappropriate or damaging it may have been (Freud seems to have been a rare exception to this kind of acting out).<br />What's troubling to read in this book is not so much Jung's having an affair with Spielrein--harmful enough all by itself--but the casual brutality in how he handled it:  the resumption of it after she had attacked him and asked Freud for help, Jung's lame excuses for dropping her (even telling her at one point that he'd displaced an attraction to Freud's daughter onto Sabina--how nice), the coldness of his self-justification to Sabina's mother when she found out via letter from Emma Jung (basically:  no fee was charged, so it wasn't really that bad--but if you wish to discuss it, that'll be ten francs an hour).... The shocking, manipulative sadism of Jung's repeated betrayals of Spielrein might make difficult reading for those who revere him, even granting that they took place before Jung's \\"confrontation with the unconscious.\\"<br />The book also sheds light on the human background of Jung's theories about the anima.  Plenty here for feminist critics.<br />Kerr also makes a convincing case for Freud's affair with his sister-in-law Minna, although this reader is not entirely sold on it (allow me to keep at least one post-doctoral illusion!).  The affair matters because of Kerr's claim that Jung and Freud indulged in implied threats of mutual sexual blackmail toward the end of their correspondence (I won't show them yours if you don't show them mine).<br />I can see after reading this book why some of Jung's late letters to Freud alternate between aggression and what seems like paranoia.  For six years I ran men's groups and often noticed that clients with a guilty conscience, especially about having had affairs, lived in the constant fear that someone would tell their current partner about it.  Some of what Jung wrote to Freud is consistent with a man who knows his lover (Spielrein) has sent a full confession to a friend and colleague (Freud) but does NOT know just how full a confession it was.  Jung's chronic uncertainty about what Freud did or did not know must have added tremendous stress to the ongoing battle of wills and egos.  But the submergence of the gifted if borderline-prone Spielrein is the real tragedy in this unamusing comedy of errors.<br />This book is not only interesting reading, but a good history of psychoanalysis and its pioneers--very handy for a psychology course.

Didion paints us vivid pictures of how closely the history of a place parallels what goes on in its current inhabitants.  (Susan Griffin's A CHORUS OF STONES comes to mind, but it is less geographical.)<br />California's past is more troubled than most realize.  From the mission system that wiped out thousands of Indians to the settlers who fought for &quot;purity of labor&quot; in the mines while supported by newspapers calling for outright eradication of native Californians; from the war against blacks (IF HE HOLLERS, LET HIM GO), ethnic Mexicans (see the work of Stephen Piti), and Asians (chronicled by Kevin Starr); from the replacement of green hills and native plants with asphalt and strip malls:  the history of the state is a history of brutal conquest, Big Four imperialism, Southern Pacific &quot;factories in the fields,&quot; and masses of people who cannot tell fantasy from reality.  Ethnic cleansing, concentration camps, slave labor, bare-faced corruption in high places:  we've seen it all and go on seeing it all.  Eugenics laws in several states enforced the sterilization of those deemed unfit to breed, but only here could one find an actual State Lunacy Commission to oversee the process.  (We now have a Self-Esteem Committee, a kinder, gentler form of control).<br />Why does this matter?  Because the pain involved continues, as do the machinations and the pavings-over, the taking of roles for selves and the destruction of people and resources (hasta la vista, baby).  In California we have not learned from our own past; we have covered it over and called ourselves liberals and agents of change, we whose Southern California cities were founded primarily by ex-Confederates looking for new places to build plantations.  A hundred years of psychology should have warned us that what we repress from awareness does not go away:  it festers like an untended wound.  For that reason exposes such as Didion's perform the valuable service of showing us where our collective psyche hurts and stands in need of healing.hundred years of psychology should have warned us that what we repress from awareness does not go away:  it festers like an untended wound.

The superegoic hatred of impulse; the Dickensian pasteboard moralizing; the conservative exaltation of appropriate manners and self-restraint....The only characters I was able to care about in this novel were the villains--or rather, given Austen's sterilized offsetting of taste versus boorishness, call them negative role models.  And even they did nothing more dramatic than offering an occasional cold shoulder to the well-bred and undeserving.<br />But then I wonder:  perhaps all this is some fantastic satire?  Perhaps the pomposity and the Emily Postian fussiness is a deliberate attempt at humor?  If so, I'm sorry to say it went above my head.<br />Pride and Prejudice is next; I hope it's a more human work than this one was.	2003-12-17

Use this as a guide to getting your mind into the topic and what it involves, not as a how-to.<br />There is one area that makes me nervous about how much of the book derived from having actually done what it recommends.  About the DirecWay satellite system:  I have used that system, and what's not stated in the book are its numerous glaring flaws.  It is slow.  It doesn't interface well with a wireless network.  It is notorious (I found out after the fact) for having a problem accessing Hotmail.  Customer support is almost useless; the email address and Web site that come with the installation are wrong, and the person who answers the phone very often doesn't know a satellite from a sabersaw.  Any networking you do requiring an Ethernet port won't happen, because there is none.  You can't download a file larger than 170 Mg in any four-hour period (and no, it's not in the product documentation because there's none of that either--all you get is a small online help file).  And the speed is about the same as the 56K modem I once used over a phone line.  Why isn't any of that discussed?  It made me wonder how much of what the author(s) talked about actually came from a hands-on perspective.	2003-11-21

I did want deeper character development, and the ending was a bit of a letdown in some ways, but overall this book entertained me.<br />Few reviewers have commented on the shadowy Priory of Sion, said to be a kind of secret forerunner to the Rosicrucians, the Knights Templar, and even the Masons.  I looked around a bit on the Internet and found sites that insisted on the Priory's reality and others that insisted it was a hoax.  In this novel a main function of the Priory is to safeguard the esoteric wisdom tradition handed down from Jesus to Mary Magdelene.  I've never seen any hard evidence for the claim that they married and founded a dynasty, but in the Gospel of Peter and the fragmented Gospel of Mary you can find references to Mary arousing the jealousy of the Twelve by being Jesus' favorite pupil.  Perhaps the early church deposed the true inheritor of the inner teachings right from the start.  (Check out the &quot;saint&quot; at Jesus' right hand in Leonardo's famous last supper painting.)<br />During my doctoral work on the missions of California I frequently came across people who insisted that Columbus was not a slave-owner, Cortez was not a butcher, and nearly half a million Indians did not perish of syphilis in upper and lower California, nor did the newspapers and the 49ers carry out a systematic program of genocide (&quot;purity of labor&quot; they called it in the mines).  Why?  Because it's easier not to change one's mind about what mom and dad and the church have always said was truth--conviction being safer than disillusionment even if it involves the spectacle of adults telling other adults what they can and cannot read and think.  This novel is a work of fiction, but be aware that it does raise issues that challenge the dominant patriarchal paradigm under which Christendom has operated for so many centuries.cannot read and think.

I've been using it as a kind of checklist of assumptions while writing my doctoral dissertation on the history of colonialism in California, and in spite of an occasional smattering of post-colonial terminology I've found it an invaluable check on my own writing as well as a useful sensitizer to how &quot;third world&quot; peoples are portrayed in the news (e.g., photographs of hordes of children and gun-toting parents in portrayals of the Arab world--as opposed to the suits and neckties of America; in the West we invent things, in China they &quot;stumble upon them&quot;; places like Africa and Indonesia are &quot;underdeveloped&quot; and &quot;mysterious&quot; and even empty--implicit invitations to makeovers by industry and big business; and so forth).<br />Highly recommended for readers with the courage for a straight look at how pernicious the logic of domination remains in &quot;free&quot; societies.	2003-09-25

Not quite, although I did tire of hearing about what a rotten father Frank Herbert had been to Brian.  I don't idealize Herbert and can see the need to be true to how his children experienced him, but as my other reviews indicate, I am not a fan of people bringing relentlessly into print recurrent complaints that ought to be voiced within the family, between friends, or in therapy.  Nevertheless, to see the two reconciled was warming to read; both fathers and sons will appreciate many of the obstacles involved.<br />I was going to comment at length on the poor editing job (the main reason I only gave this book a 3) but reviewers below have already done so.  An obvious catch would have been asking the author to decide between Dad, Father, Frank, and Frank Herbert.  The frequent shifts made my eyes sore.  (I should own up here to a negative impression going in to this biography:  when I wrote the author to ask a question about Chapterhouse, he responded only with a pitch for his own serializations.  This lost him a potential customer.)<br />Many interesting connections are drawn between Herbert's personal experiences and various themes in his books, particularly the Dune books.  For those alone it's a worthy read, and may enhance your appreciation of the original series.  There are also many interesting anecdotes about Herbert's life and the sense of jovial humanity that shines through in his writing.<br />The book is clear and very readable and organized in chronological fashion to make Herbert's life story unfold in a meaningful and easily understood order.  The death of brave Beverly and the family's reactions were particularly moving, and upon hearing at one point that the author could not continue writing, I too put down the book for a moment, feeling the pain in the words.	2003-09-13

We have tended to be a people obsessed with forms of revenge, retribution, surveillance, and punishment we euphemize as &quot;justice&quot; and, since the Bush administration took over, &quot;state security.&quot;  Ironically, those who pass for followers of the man who said to &quot;love your enemies&quot; have been among the most determined supporters of eye-for-an-eye, letter-of-the-law, and, most recently, preemptive strike.<br />In this book the former Archbishop of Capetown has given us not only an eye-opening account of the brutalities and intricacies of post-Apartheid justice, but a model for moving beyond the various forms of institutionalized retribution.  Pointing out the unworkability of trying and sentencing perpetrators of apartheid, he describes the joys and difficulties of the &quot;truth and reconciliation&quot; approach to justice:  the granting of political amnesty to those who make a full confession of their crimes.  An additional beauty of the process is its openness to the stories of those who were victimized, many of whom have been willing to pass up the opportunity for legal revenge in order to speak about their sufferings to those who were responsible for them.<br />Although this amnesty--as opposed to what Tutu calls &quot;amnesia,&quot; the denial approach to the past--has not been a perfect solution to the fallout of apartheid, it has offered the world a model of reconciliation at the level of the trans-punishment consciousness of a Gandhi, a Jesus, a Martin Luther King Jr.  For that reason alone it bears study by readers who are ready for alternatives to the cycles of retribution that inundate the world even now with ever-widening circles of &quot;moral&quot; warfare and all the rest of the self-justifying brutality that only creates new injustices.	2003-09-13

Like her other books, this one was clearly written, easy on the eyes, clever, witty, and packed with interesting out-of-the-way information.  It's a pleasant and well-composed discourse through the history of romantic love in the West.  If you come to it from that point of view, you might like it.<br />If a criterion of a good read is that the author inspires in you some of the emotions she describes, then most of the book succeeded for me:  at times I wondered what she'd be like on a date....<br />Parts of the book get into human instincts.  While there's evidence for these--the rooting instinct in babies, for instance--we need to bear in mind that human instincts are heavily modified by time, place, and personality.  The maternal instinct, for example, is painted in ideal colors:  the loving mother mirroring her baby.  We've all seen that; but some of us have also met mothers who hate their children (or, worse, feel indifferent toward them) and whose maternal instinct never sees the daylight.  We shouldn't follow Freud's old 19th Century slippage from psychology into biology unless we're prepared to ignore the social and spiritual roots of human motivation.<br />I appreciate the author's knack for collecting a lot of information on a given topic, then giving us the best fruits of her learnings in breezy and often poetic language.	2003-05-30

After reading the introductory material I was surprised at the brevity of the chapters:  a consequence, perhaps, of how much lore has been lost down the centuries.<br />This book broke new ground not only by celebrating the goddesses (and by implication women and femininity) but by pointing out that &quot;the&quot; Greek myths known far and wide were preceded by matriarchal traditions transmuted by incoming Dorian patriarchs (see also the work of Maria Gimbutis and Riane Eisler) and centuries of his-story.  The author strives to recover something of the earlier traditions in her lively, and at times lyric, reconstruction of the pre-Olympian goddesses.<br />The book left me with an open reflection.  To some extent the story of Ulysses has followed me for years (or I have followed it), and I've come to appreciate what I perceive as the feminine warrior protectiveness of Athena, one of my favorites of the Greek pantheon.  As Minerva her visage adorns the Great Seal of my homeland, California.  And yet according to this book, Athena was made into a soldier by bloodthirsty male barbarians.  Although there can be little doubt about the patriarchal distortions of the Greek goddesses--how many positive stories do you hear about Hera?--I'm wondering if we lose something in relegating quite so much to these distortions.  Athena &quot;feels&quot; fiercely protective (but not soldierly) to me in dreams, in active imagination, and in fantasy:  is this her quality, an archetypal aspect of her being, or does it merely derive from my being a man raised in a patriarchy?  Or a man with an assertive anima?  I don't know.<br />In any case this book remains a nice counterbalance to the usual versions of Homeric and Olympian mythology we find even now in most books dealing with Greek deities.  There is also a cutting criticism of Jungian conflations of goddess, femininity, and darkness that will delight readers tired of hearing about the passive, yin-like, and shadowy &quot;archetypal feminine,&quot; a convenient category for shoring up unjust power relations.e, and shadowy &quot;archetypal feminine,&quot; a convenient category for shoring up unjust power relations.	2003-05-30

If this level of silencing is somewhat unusual, bear in mind that the American phobia of death has motivated a clinical-medical bureaucracy designed to make this most final of departures clean and pretty.  (In Southern California we even have Forest Lawn, a kind of Disneyland of Death, where the fast food paradigm has been applied to the managing of passed-on loved ones.)  What it does instead is hold the dying at a distance while traumatizing those who survive.<br />Much of this book was written during the author's caretaking of her father-in-law as he lay ill, sometimes comfortable and sometimes in pain.  It is not a book to entertain or philosophize, but to reveal what such an experience can be like:  the details to tend, the feelings that surface, the constant struggles against laws written to protect people from getting close to death's unpleasantness.  For the author, \\"standing the watch\\" was a way to deepen her connections with her patient as well as with her husband and family members.  It also allowed her to deal with the unfinished pain around her previous inability to properly mourn her father.<br />Some among the existential philosophers have insisted that we all die alone.  That is often true given the legal and medical and psychological isolation of the dying in our death-fearing culture.  But what's so often taken as a normal state of the end of an existence need not be.  The man tended by a woman who started life as a war orphan and the son who married her died at home in the presence of loving family members who took the time to see him off.<br />For him this was a great gift, and for them a reminder to seize the time while refusing to let our pioneer cult of individuality keep us from exploring those healthy interdependencies that make life worth valuing enough to end on a note of dignity.them a reminder to seize the time while refusing to let our pioneer cult of individuality keep us from exploring those healthy interdependencies that make life worth valuing enough to end on a note of dignity.	2003-03-19

My few forays into economic topics have left me wandering in seas of abstraction....until now.  If I could be made to understand anything at all in this field, you will be too--trust me on this.<br />The author has quite a diverse background that uniquely qualifies him to write such a book:  he is a conservation biologist with a wide knowledge of economic theory and hands-on training in several related fields.<br />Another valuable aspect of this book is its courage in confronting a taboo topic:  unlimited growth.  Unlimited growth is good?  Well, says who?  And why?  The author goes through a quick survey of past economic thought to illustrate how our growth obsession came to be.<br />Part One of the book deals with the topic of &quot;The Runaway Train&quot;:  an economy dependent on eternal expansion--clearly an impossibility on a planet of limited (and rapidly diminishing) resources.  Part Two is about stopping the train and deals with relations between three socioeconomic classes:  the liquidators (the wealthy), the steady-staters (the unwealthy), and the amorphs (everyone else).<br />The author mentions Maslow's need hierarchy.  The liquidators tend to be obsessed with levels three and four:  namely, belonging and esteem needs.  Psychology has come a long way since Maslow, however, and we now see things more in terms of socially sanctioned conditioning forces and the perpetuation of narcissism.  The hierarchy itself has taken a beating and should perhaps be replaced with a more current model of human motivation that does more justice to the impact of class and ethnicity.  It could even be argued--and probably would by Maslow himself--that the insatiable urge to accumulate wealth has nothing to do with either belonging or esteem...but a lot to do with more antisocial propensities.<br />For me the least helpful part of the book discussed women in terms of a &quot;mothering instinct&quot; and brought biological images into the discussion of gender relations and economic motives.  When we start talking about wealth as an exhibit of plumage to attract the females, we are on extremely unsafe ground.  The basic point--that unchecked consumption is harmful--can be made without reductionistic metaphors which postcolonial and feminist psychological thought and cross-cultural research have long since challenged as Western biases and grand narratives that obscure more than they reveal.<br />I wish this book well in educating the majority about liquidating vs. steady-state styles of being.  As I write this review the flag-waving majority in America seem capable of believing whatever the powers that be tell them via a mass media apparatus owned by--guess who?--the liquidating class, poised to liquidate more than assets.  Perhaps in place of the need hierarchy and the biological metaphors could appear a discussion about how to grapple with the ongoing and aggressive colonization of consciousness so evident in the West...a colonization so powerful that even the prospects of environmental destruction and the mass extinction of life on Earth are insufficient to halt it.part of the book discussed women in terms of a &quot;mothering instinct&quot; and brought biological images into the discussion of gender relations and economic motives.

There is a minimum of speculation and a maximum of sense and event.  The life of the ranch, its voice, surfaces now and again through human conflicts and encounters against the backdrop of its imminent sale.  As Jane Wheelright says:  &quot;The coastline of the ranch is like the floor plan of my life....&quot;<br />Both writers are Jungian analysts, and most of the Jungian commentary is provided by Lynda Schmidt, who on occasions describes the ranch as a &quot;manifestation of the Self&quot; (for Jung, the Self with a capital S meant the archetype of totality; he also called it the God-image).<br />I think we must be very careful--and Lynda Schmidt generally is--when we bring in archetypal concepts, because how we do so can either illuminate or devalue their manifestations.  It's like describing one's wife as a Goddess figure or an anima container:  what happened to the actual woman?  If we see wilderness as a manifestation of the Self, or even of God, is this helpful, or does it shift our attention away from the wilderness as an entity in its own right?<br />This is one of the few books that take the land seriously.  Here is a characteristic passage:<br />I had a strong sense of being buried deep in the soil, lost under the vast, rocky ledges, melted into the landscape, submerged as an integral part of that place.  None of the others in my generation had the remotest sense of being so influenced.  I was starting at scratch and I felt like a child about to be orphaned.	2003-02-09

Most emphasize the \\"pioneer\\" (read:  white colonization) days, and the rest the technical magnificence of the Valley of Silicon Delight.<br />This new important work delineates the history of ethnic Mexicans in the county, particularly its East Side.  From the poisonous mines of Almaden to the poisonous laboratories of the West Side, it has been ethnically based labor for low pay that has allowed the county to develop in all its prolific economic richness.  The author's book provides an overview of these dynamics through research, figures, facts, and eyewitness accounts.<br />The \\"devil\\" mentioned in the title has to do with racism, and the book goes beyond the usual sociological and psychological explanations of racism to emphasize its classist underpinnings in a supposedly classless society.  Also emphasized are the creative responses in opposition to it as ethnic Mexicans have made their voices heard and refused to be subjugated without meaningful forms of culturally enhancing assertiveness.  Highly recommended.	2003-01-24

After a Preface and an Intro full of apologies for the selection itself, we come to sentences like this:  &quot;Faced with an incomprehensible and multifaceted alerity, the European theoretically has the option of responding to the Other in terms of identity or difference.&quot;  Or this:  &quot;The process of describing the colonized [in Ireland] and inscribing them in the discourse as second-order citizens in comparison with the colonizers commenced with the invocation of the judicial and military power of the State....&quot;  Can you tell the difference between these sentences, written by authors of different cultural backgrounds?  Me neither.<br />It would be nice to see a collection in which the authors speak in their own voices without inscribing, discoursing, deconstructing, alerity-ing, or counter-hegemonying themselves--and us--into numbness.  The field is really too promising, too important, to leave to yet another jargonized and specialized vocabulary that does the authors' obviously thoughtful experience no justice and some harm.	2003-01-17

I hate to say critical things about one of my favorite California historians, but you're better off with any of his other books.  This, written as a kind of memoir, spends more time on historical events in the US than it does on Carey.  Another problem is his recurrent pointing out of how he foresaw certain events and was not surprised by others--it reads as though he feels he hasn't been given enough credit (which he hasn't) and must bring his foresightedness to the reader's attention.  Maybe he was old and lonely when he wrote this, but in any case it's not of his usual calibre.  Clearly written, though.	2003-01-10

For me, what clearly emerged during the author's confrontation with her storytelling ability, her extraverted extravagance, and her occasional bullying, was that Benson was being made to feel exactly how Steinbeck would have felt, especially toward the end of the marriage.  And the same with getting lost at times in New York, and feeling &quot;out of touch&quot; here and there, and worrying about bad reviews:  I think the biographer actually became the subject of his biography a little, sharing from his own rather humble and introverted point of view what Steinbeck couldn't or wouldn't bring himself to write publicly about regarding his own private struggles, doubts, confusions.

It is a measure of McWilliams' penetrating and witty grasp of the state and its foibles, follies, and fandangos that most of what he wrote is still so relevant and even indispensable.<br />McWilliams' central premise is that the discovery of gold catapulted California through what took other regions of the planet centuries to go through--hence our individualism, do-it-yourself lifestyles, and general motion and mayhem.  We've been doing reenactments of the Gold Rush ever since.  As he puts it:  &quot;Essentially California developed 'outside' the framework, the continuum, of the American frontier.  The difference is that between a child raised in the home of his parents, with relatives and familiar surroundings, and the child taken from his home at an early age and brought up in a remote and different environment.&quot;  Quite so.

My reaction to visiting the Serra Missions was not spiritual delight, but anger, sorrow, and nausea.  (My Cherokee ancestors walked The Trail Where We Cried.)  At the same time, the author doesn't pitch religion; he photographs and writes up his reactions, and his sense of wonder comes through nicely.	2002-11-20

Maryk, Keefer, Keith, and of course Queeg are unforgettable, Queeg in particular, for every one of us--Navy or not--who has suffered under a paranoid perfectionist will recognize Queeg's style in a heartbeat. The strawberry \\"crisis\\" is a case in point.<br />As the novel progresses, young Willie Keith seems to come around to a more Navy-oriented point of view--namely: incompetent and eccentric officers are part of the hazards of war; one must simply make do. At the risk of mistaking Keith for Wouk, I found this a troubling conclusion, given the madness of poor Stilwell, the life-risking incidents aboard the Caine--and of course my own vivid encounters with Queeglike imbeciles too perfectionistically by-the-book to listen to reason or feel even an ounce of empathy for their victims. Chains of command of any kind attract just such personalities. But the consequences should not be passed off as business as usual.<br />Like any good novelist, Wouk paints the reader vivid pictures of events, scenes, little dramas and big ones. At times you can smell burning oil and hear the curses of overworked sailors. It's pleasant to see Willie Keith grow up with all this as his chosen context.	2002-11-13

Drawing examples from art and literature and the lives of those who create them, the author illustrates for us the potential richness and vitality to be gained--on both sides!--through a dialogical approach to these inner figures when they arise and display their astonishing aliveness.<br />In theoretical terms, this approach supplements and expands our social and developmental notions.  Operating &quot;inwardly&quot; or &quot;outwardly,&quot; psyche is an exquisitely dialogical process.<br />For clinicians and nonclinicians alike, the author's interpretation of what we fear from unbridled fantasy--psychotic states, hallucinations, multiple personality, and the like--as impoverished and dissociated disturbances rather than enlivened conversations with liberated faces and voices will encourage further exploration of the imaginal (as opposed to &quot;imaginary,&quot; which for most means &quot;unreal&quot;).  If anything, it is the repression and disavowal of the imaginal that supports various states of pathological possession.<br />If the sudden guests who summon our attention subvert the rigidity of our well-developed ego atop the air-conditioned skyscraper of personality, they simultaneously enrich the flexible potentialities of a humbler and more dialogical kind of consciousness.	2002-10-11

Yes, it rambles.  Yes, it is self-indulgent.  Yes, it's a travelogue, some of the detail entirely incidental.  And he uses too damned many italics on words that don't merit them.  Tra-la.<br />This book was written by a man who went through tragedy so terrible that in publicity photographs taken afterward, he looks to have aged about twenty-five years in six.  He does not, like C. S. Lewis, explain his grieving as a kind of conversion, nor does he go into the depths of it, as Robert Romanyshyn does.  And why?  Because Mr. Peart is not a novelist or essayist or psychologist:  he is the lyricist for the rock band RUSH, and this book is the story of what he did when, deep in grief over his dead daughter, his wife died as well:  he got on his motorcycle and rode.<br />The result is this book, a kind of journal-in-motion.  Some will view it as an escape.  But with a man like Peart, to ride away from pain too enormous to face all at once is to ride, eventually, toward it, taking it into his soul piece by piece along the way, finding a bit of it here in a rainy day, there in an engine clogged by an accidental dousing of diesel fuel.  There is no one-time immersion, no epiphany to the sound of literary trumpets, no:  like many a Rush song, it is a gradually growing sense of enlivenment, like that of many an inwardly dead-feeling survivor who learns, a little at a time, to live--and to run, as M. Scott Momaday says of his character Abel, beyond (because through and out the other side of) his pain.<br />It bears reflection, too, that the former atheistic fan of Ayn Randian individualism learns bit by bit to connect--and when he does, he allows himself to do what so many men lack the courage for:  to depend.	2002-09-30

The first is the cost. The book is no larger than a moderate-sized hardback. It's not even three hundred pages long.<br />The second reason is what I see as a fatal conceptual flaw. There is much of interest here about the relationship between California as a locale and the writings and personalities of Steinbeck, Austin, and other Californian authors. But the author insists on attributing how they experienced the land in terms of \\"projection,\\" a psychological concept heavily criticized for its dualistic nineteenth-century thinking. It originated in Freudian psychoanalysis, where even there it was never used so freely; analysts point out that only when something is conflictual and repressed do we \\"project\\" it--and only then onto people, not places.<br />Nowadays analysts talk less about projecting than about intersubjective fields in which all participants make a psychic contribution. Something analogous (suggests depth psychology) might be true of place. As indigenous peoples insist, we do not animate places with godlike beams of projection; we interact with them in much more complex and mysterious ways--and sometimes even through our psychological weaknesses. (For more about this, see the writings of Robert Romanyshyn and Keith Basso.)<br />This could be an outstanding book if it took the voice of landscape seriously and on its own terms instead of reducing it to geography and psychology. At the very least the point of view of indigenous writers deserves a mention.	2002-09-23

Very often, when sexual abuse survivors tell their tale, they have been made to feel so much like objects that even as adults their earlier thoughts and feelings remain hidden.  In this case, however, the author has given us glimpses of the inner life of a child terrorized by a man given permission by a patriarchal religious background to be \\"head of the household\\":  that is, a darth vader, the head domestic terrorist.<br />As the tale unfolds you can see how the perpetrator isolates, then brainwashes his victims while increasing their physical and psychological dependency on him.  And how black-white, this-that, right-wrong beliefs merely reinforce his own absolutist opinions and literalistic excuses for seduction and violence.  The self-justifications, the lies, the false faces and twisted thinking were familiar to me through my counseling work with perpetrators, whose primary agenda is the complete control of family members.<br />What the author also details for us is the adulthood fallout of abuse, and the lifelong struggle for clarity.  Sticking closely to his experiences, he shows us what it is to try assembling a self without having had a sense of self--and burdened at the same time with the hyper-rigid shoulds, oughts, and other forms of shame and self-hatred deposited into his psyche by the abuser.  (I believe it was Elie Wiesel who said that it's always the victims who feel shame, not the executioners.)<br />A particularly sad moment:  sitting in the courtroom hearing attorneys warp a sexual abuse case into a religious battle, the author thinks:  why did I put myself through this ordeal?  Such legalistic wranglings only serve the perpetrator, of course, mirroring as they do his own attempts to control other people through misrepresentation, procedural weaknesses, and word games.<br />In spite of this, the author moves ahead with his own healing, demonstrating that the benefits of asserting oneself don't necessarily depend on happy outcomes, legal or otherwise.  To find that the world isn't so bad a place to inhabit in spite of all the suffering, and to become comfortable with one's differentness, are only two of the treasures he uncovers on his pilgrimage.  A third is learning to get more comfortable--despite abuse, rejection by \\"Christian\\" elders, and a homophobic society--with being gay, a thing hard to come by even without having been incested or raised in a fragmented family.  (Remarkably, the abuser has written about the sinfulness of his son's homosexuality.  Apparently it's OK to terrorize an entire family, use spirituality for subjugation, and even rape one's children--but not OK for a man to show love to another man.  The family values of perpetrators and those who support them are truly unique.)<br />Finally, the book is also a topical reminder that sexual abuse is not confined to (or mismanaged by) the Catholic Church, and that many \\"Christian\\" organizations are more interested in protecting their clergy than its victims.  In this they resemble the gentlemen whom Jesus criticized for shutting the door on those who follow.  Not every church, temple, or parish provides a safe haven for perpetrators, of course--but an emphasis on politics, male control of women, missionary persuasion, ideological domination, and uncritical obedience make large religious organizations attractive to victimizers looking for protection and self-authorization.  The more political an organization, the greater its usefulness to predators adept at making rigid rules work in their favor.<br />I recommend this book to abuse survivors actively engaged in the struggle for selfhood.herwise.

A good example is the author's letter to Marvin Minsky, whom he calls \\"vermin\\" and to whom he delivers several other personal insults.  This kind of rhetoric precludes all chance at dialog and makes one look to those still on the fence like a well-schooled loudmouth.  (I find Minsky's thoughts about the fusion of machine with human downright frightening, extraordinarily arrogant, even apocalyptic....but I've never met the man and would not presume to call him any names until I did....)<br />By all means let us launch uncompromising and openly outraged attacks on the denial that excuses behaviors and attitudes that clearly harm self, community, and world--but can't we do it without all the self-defeating shaming, finger-pointing, and personal attacks that make us sound more petulant than earnest in our concerns?	2002-08-18

I know of only one newsman with the heart and guts and literary power of the author, let alone the worldweary humor that never wearies, and it's not Mencken, although his work sometimes reminds me of Mencken's.

What impressed me most about this book was its emphasis that imperialistic exploitation is not a dead relic of a past we Anglos are ashamed of and wish to forget.  The fun continues, and it makes little difference what we call it:  manifest destiny, bringing civilization to the primitives, or new world order.<br />Another point:  we've been long overdue for a Deloria-style criticism of Anglos who exploit Indian folklore and beliefs.  I refer to those who claim esoteric knowledge from Native shamans and all the rest of it.  What such folks, including the anthropologists and social scientists who pretend more objectivity, never ask themselves is:  do I have any right to make a profit and gain a reputation from the people I claim to have learned from?  What do they get out of it?  Does it benefit them or harm them?  (The claim that Indian people don't need any kind of concrete benefits because they aren't \\"materialistic\\" is particularly nauseating.)<br />At one point, while contemplating doing some interviews with local Indians about their experience of being blinkered, baffled, and b.s.ed for 250 years, I reread parts of this book--particularly the \\"we want to be left alone\\" parts--and decided that I lacked the temerity even to ask for such interviews.  Deloria suggests that no research of any kind be done that isn't approved in council and that doesn't clearly demonstrate some use to the Indians themselves.  I would also suggest to other Anglo readers that before they involve themselves in matters indigenous they be very honest about their motivations--particularly where any notions of being \\"helpful\\" might occur.  Our \\"helpfulness\\" has been genocidal and even now perpetrates stereotypes, as Indians may tell you if you're genuinely receptive to the feedback.<br />Books like this are a good reminder that the true primitive is he who goes on colonizing others--intellectually, religiously, economically--without having the courage to look at his own dark side as it flourishes in the here and now.ishes in the here and now.	2002-05-09

The editors of this version have put them in roughly chronological order and taken out some of the more repetitious pieces--and it really works well when you sit down with this remarkable book and make your way through the life tale of the greatest of all tall tale men.<br />What also comes through clearly is the immense sadness and loneliness he felt at the end of his life.  He is a man looking back on a lifetime of irreplaceable moments, some tragic, some unjust, many downright hilarious--and some unspeakably poignant, as when Twain mentions his pride to discover that his little daughter Susy, who died before him, had started writing his biography.<br />If you want to know more about the man who saw a river so wide it only had one bank, this is the place.  More than almost any biography I can remember, this one made me smile, made me laugh loudly, and just as often filled my eyes with tears.<br />&quot;I love to think of the great and godlike Clemens.&quot;  -- Rudyard Kipling	2002-05-04

The author uses an impressive accumulation of scholarly research--maps, documents, explorers' accounts--to trace the origin and development of the myth that California was an island.  Highly readable and very clearly organized and written.  Although I found her conclusion that the island myth comes from what people project onto California (from an ecopsychological standpoint, the myth might represent the imaginal presence of the landscape protecting itself) to be reductive, this is an invaluable resource for anyone researching early Californian cartography, especially as a history of errors.	2002-04-29

And laugh.<br />Reading it, I was reminded of the Hispanic legend of La Llorona, the ghostly Weeping Woman who dwells near bodies of water.  Some version of her shows up in every time and place where the feminine is enslaved, used up and exiled.  The land itself weeps Lloronic tears.  So do haunted houses.<br />In our Get Over It society it is often asked:  why must we continue to dwell on such terrible pasts--the Holocaust, slavery, or, as in this novel, whose unfolding story is its own and only \\"message,\\" the genocidal times just after the Reconstruction that ought really to be called the Redestruction?  (As though we ever really did dwell on them!)<br />Because to forget is to repeat the past.  To forget that our racist, imperialist age of empires has infected us with a microbe of intolerance gives it the quiet in which it mushrooms into still more hatred, still more retaliation.  When politicians start talking about ridding the world of evil, the one thing you can count on is that denial of the past has helped reawaken the plague....and that the only possible containments are the awareness of being its carriers (I speak as an Anglo-American whose country is fed with steady transfusions of incomprehensible injustice), the courage to differ--and the stories of those we have tried in vain to silence.<br />For the dead, too, speak in this novel.  To contemplate how many of them stand behind it in the shadows of being is to sit, for a page or two at a time, within a hallowed space.	2002-04-12

The English translation is very clear and put together from sources other than Las Casas, whose facts weren't always straight.  For some reason the paragraphs are all center-justified and taper out oddly.  Various theories about Columbus's landfall are discussed.<br />The one flaw is the introductory pieces that whitewash the man himself.  Made out to be a bold, great hero, he was in actuality a gold-obsessed sailor, a poor mariner, a perpetual whiner whose crew could barely stand him, an intolerant European who assumed every land he touched belong to his King back in Spain, and of course the initiator of the slavery system in Espanola.  His men built the first fortress in the so-called New World, and they brought several Native captives back to Spain.  Fortunately, some of these events are mentioned in the Log itself.	2002-04-10

Pilar's tragic stories go on and on, as do pointless conversations in caves with desperate people swearing at each other and hitting each other in the mouth (which, alas, only encourages more conversation instead of silencing it).  The constant use of &quot;obscenity,&quot; &quot;muck,&quot; etc. instead of the real swear words is truly wearying, and the translation of Spanish terms into &quot;thee,&quot; &quot;thou,&quot; and &quot;less bad&quot; mean nothing at all to the casual English reader.<br />Nor is Robert Jordan (why does Hemingway keep using his full name throughout the novel?  That's irritating too) much help, being a typical Hemingway strong-and-silent-type who drinks too much, enjoys bullfights, and lives to sleep with pretty 19-year-olds.  &quot;The earth moved&quot; is the best he can do in the supposedly passionate and brief love scenes with Maria, who enjoys pouring him more wine while washing his feet.  His doubts about doing his duty are neither profound nor convincing.  Until well into the novel he's a too-typical freedom fighter who justifies duty over Eros in dreary inner conversations.  Like another reviewer put it, I wished a quarter into the novel that he'd spare me his musings, blow the damned bridge and go home.	2002-03-30

I'm astounded that nobody here has reviewed this fine book, a series of essays that provide an exquisite blend of the public and the personal, all woven together in a fine, sincere prose so characteristic of this author.<br />Although the themes dealt with here are similar to those in her A CHORUS OF STONES, these are formatted more as straight-up essays with occasional dashes of literary experimentation.  They are readable and revelatory in their interconnection of women's issues, feminism, ecology, history, and contemporary events, all held together around the central theme of Eros.	2002-03-15

Well, where do you go after stating such a premise?<br />He goes into a lengthy first chapter on mathematics, which only by the barest of ideas links up to the development of his thesis.  He then takes off in other directions, and soon the reader knows for certain that Spengler was to be taken at his word in the Introduction:  he's out to present a philosophy, not a history of civilization.<br />And present it he does, no matter how distant the connections and associations his intuition insists on bringing into the discussion.  It's not that they don't connect, but that (per the intuitive's inherent weakness) many only connect in ways that don't really matter and could have been left out of even this, an abridged edition of the original work.<br />The latter part of the book revives the reader who gets that far, but it's a lot of work for the gold one finds there.  Perhaps Spengler makes his central point best by the very fragmentation and disconnection so evident in his prose.	2002-01-18

Certainly he'd never have argued that because a patient's stomach hurt during a painful recital of an early memory, this indigestible piece of emotional trauma was &quot;caused&quot; by the gastronomic rejection of a burnt piece of toast eaten just before the session. OF COURSE psychical activity has a physical substrate. And, perhaps, vice versa. What he'd have wanted to know was: in what psychological situation was all this embedded?<br />One can't help but admire the boldness and honesty with which Freud presented his own dreams and associations. We might speculate in hindsight that Irma, the partially cured patient whom Freud tried to talk out of her hysteria, showed up in his dream with throat and stomach symptoms and an illness caused by a bad injection to protest the way he injected women with his sex-etiology theories, thereby in effect silencing their true voice; and smile at Freud's dream of an orator named Lecher, a dream he had shortly after accepting a position in which he did a lot of public speaking about psychology.<br />But that we can speculate thus we owe largely to the techniques inspired by Freud himself.  He was often wrong, but the spirit of his endeavor lives on.	2002-01-11

In this small book Freud takes a mistranslated childhood memory of Leonardo's--one in which a kite (Freud thought it a vulture) opens the baby's mouth with its tail feathers--and makes a case for a genius born out of wedlock left alone too much with his mother, and therefore prone to homosexuality.  Lame.<br />As always, though, Freud at least arrives in the ballpark, even if he doesn't understand the game.  Initial memories are often strangely prophetic, even when constructed out of fantasy; and so perhaps the fantastic kite--known for its interesting flight configurations--suckled the young Leonardo's latent inventive urges, or even symbolized their later expression.<br />Note:  in this study first appears Freud's use of the term Eros, which he later makes such a fundamental part of his theory.	2002-01-08

Even so, these elements make it an interesting psychological study in what happens to the Anglo colonizer mentality when it encounters years of solitude--and then, finally, what Jung would have called its shadow, in the form of subservient Friday, whose life has been saved, not out of compassion, but from a need for an able fellow navigator off the island.  It won't surprise the reader that one of the first words Crusoe teaches him is &quot;Master.&quot;<br />Not recommended for children except as an examination of archaically unabashed white superiority left to its own devices.	2002-01-04

This sounds to me like the Christianistic bias toward spirit and against embodiment that Jung beat up on so often in his writings and seminars.<br />Speaking of Jung, Hannah mentions his rudeness and irritability toward her, then justifies it by saying it did her some kind of individuative good.  This common Jungian excuse for being mean to people needs to be shelved in favor of taking personal responsibility for one's bad temper; in a fit of idealization, too many followers have passed off Jung's as though it were some sort of profound emanation from the unconscious.  For more on this dynamic read up on Anna Freud's description of the defense known as &quot;identification with the aggressor.&quot;<br />While most of the material is standard Jung and none of it is particularly deep or detailed, it's clearly written and to be recommended as a very basic introduction to classic Jungian thought.	2001-12-27

The animism argument is an outdated one and has been pummeled both by ecopsychology and by the aboriginal feeling for the sacredness of place.  Edinger was an excellent Jungian analyst, but he was obviously no ecologist.  Nor do his descriptions of traditional spirituality as less developed than, say, individuative methods do him or Jung much credit.  Why do Jungians so often forget that Jung was a theist?<br />Given this, his dream (p. 74) is informative:  finding himself in an alien-feeling world, he sees that the people listening to him are afraid of catching an infection from him--upon which he dances a jig, no longer afraid of them, and says, &quot;Jumping Jehosephat&quot;--an able description of the missionary enthusiasm with which a former Jehovah's (Jehosephat) Witness goes about acting his part in a kind of exteriorized play in which the world's a dangerous stage of &quot;conflict and intrigue.&quot;<br />A plus is that this book is free of all the alchemical, etc. imagery originally reproduced to good expository purpose by Jung but wearyingly repeated by so many of his followers in their explanations of his thought; even the mandatory photo of Jung is absent.  Another plus is that the selections from Jung's letters were well thought out and provide fascinating insights to readers who haven't read what's been published and translated so far of Jung's voluminous correspondence.	2001-12-27

I've read several women's history books and have found things in here not accessible elsewhere.<br />At the same time, I don't find descriptions of men as biological &quot;deviants,&quot; the attacks on phallic symbolism, etc. the least bit helpful. They are certainly understandable, and I do hear the anger behind them--millennia of anger. But by attacking manhood itself rather than its least mature and most destructive manifestation--patriarchy--this book risks offending men who are appropriately ashamed at His Story, open to hearing what women have to say about it, and willing to admit that we do carry attitudes and ideas that invalidate women, even those of us who work so hard to unearth and get beyond them.<br />Both sexes certainly need fresh looks at the past, and this book goes far toward providing one in some respects. But the demonization of either sex serves no one (except powers-that-be who wish to divide us), and if anything demonstrates more clearly than the text the damage done over the centuries to women forced into positions of degradation and passivity. One could even argue that the &quot;inferior by nature&quot; thesis originates in patriarchy and is not at all liberatory.  It is, rather, a symptom.<br />I've been happy to recommend some tremendously angry women's literature to other men and even taught it in my men's groups.  But as much as I continue to try to hear those feminine voices that still make me uncomfortable with the amount of sheer pain and rage they so necessarily vocalize, I will recommend no book that implies that there's something inherently wrong with being born male.	2001-12-24

A rare collection of important voices.<br />The idea of ecopsychology is to open up awareness to the unheard voice of the Earth.  &quot;Animism&quot; is a 19th century assumption that assumes the world lives only to the degree we project into it.  The authors here realize that animism is a reductionistic and outdated concept that only serves to justify the ongoing rape and dematerialization of the natural world--a world that in fact projects her presence into those of us who can learn to hear her.<br />This is not a back-to-nature project but a necessity if we are to preserve what's left of the Earth from our greed, haste, and the global warming of the psyche endemic to a society of rapacious and immature consumers too bent on private advantage to do what our ancestors did for a million years of history and prehistory:  recognize and respect her personhood.  And today, we can do so with all our critical faculties intact and a bit of help from green technics.	2001-12-22

Or rather, the reverse....<br />Although I can't follow Freud's evocation of the dream censor, that device which scrambles images and feelings to keep them unconscious, or the classification of Hanold's state of possession as a delusion (not meant by Freud as &quot;false,&quot; however), this well-written study is a nice example of a fair-minded psychoanalytic interpretation--in this case, one that uncovers a repressed but potentially passionate love for a flesh-and-blood woman.<br />To Freud's description of the Vesuvius dream as anxiety caused by repressed erotism--certainly true in this case--I would add that the woman buried under ash also represents the very real possibility that Hanold's capacity for relating to women, the world, and humanity is in danger of being repressed for good.  His soul is on the line, and it requires the cleverness and insight of Zoe to awaken it and fulfill its promptings.<br />In general, the Standard Edition translation into English, though comprehensive, has done Freud's literary voice little credit.  Where he'd have written that &quot;the beloved becomes infused with desire,&quot; Strackey would have interpreted that &quot;the object achieves a libidinal cathexis.&quot;  Helen Downey's translation brings out the warmth and wit of Freud's immense eloquence while remaining true to his scientific formulations.	2001-12-20

Strackey translates &quot;kultur&quot; (culture) as &quot;civilization,&quot; &quot;I&quot; as &quot;ego,&quot; and in general makes Freud seem so lifeless and cold-blooded that it's nearly impossible to get an accurate feel for his thought.<br />Without defending Freud's obvious reductionism, it needs saying that it was he who prompted us to ask:  do the demands of modern life encourage or pathologize our innermost strivings?  What do they do to our eros, our capacity for loving and feeling solidarity?  And how do they stimulate our frustration and aggression?<br />While I disagree with Freud's conclusion that the total psychic repression of powerful passions is a necessary evil for the existence of culture, I do think he challenges us to wonder about just how high a price we pay for what we believe to be the &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;nobler&quot; achievements of the mind.	2001-12-20

Fromm rigidly adheres to his version of the humanist position here by claiming that the mystics of all faiths have been imbued with the glow of man's powers--powers of heart, mind, spirit--rather than God's, God being a symbol of those same powers, awaiting unfoldment.<br />From a theistic/mystical perspective, however, this is a side-effect, and if taken for the Source of the experience brings on a tremendous inflation of the ego.  No mystic really thinks, as Fromm does, that man is the measure of all things.  Fromm is best when he sticks to human psychology--THE SANE SOCIETY, ESCAPE FROM FREEDOM, THE ART OF LOVING are worth buying.	2001-12-07

I'm a native of Southern California, and I have yet to find a better book on this territory even though this one was originally penned in the late 40's.<br />The colonizers, the boosters, the flamboyant pillars of society who bamboozled, bulldozed, and boutiqued their way into California:  they and other characters appear on the McWilliams stage in a fascinating--and at times disturbing--progression in which the land itself, that most neglected of characters, puts in appearances too.  For we Southern Californians live in a land of constant paradoxes; to quote the author (&quot;The Land of Upside Down&quot;):<br />&quot;To their amazement&quot;--he means tourists--&quot;they discovered that umbrellas were useless against the drenching rains of Southern California but that they made good shade in the summer; that many of the beautifully colored flowers had no scent; that fruit ripened earlier in the northern than in the southern part of the state; that it was hot in the morning and cool at noon...here, in this paradoxical land, rats lived in the trees and squirrels had their homes in the ground.&quot;  No wonder we're all a bit topsy-turvy out here.<br />My one objection:  I disagree with the author's description of the early Missions as &quot;concentration camps.&quot;  That through disease and, later, a mis-education that left the Native converts vulnerable to ranchero exploitation and settler genocide is beyond question; but however misguided their efforts, those early padres had no conscious agenda of wiping out a people.  Nevertheless, McWilliams's detailed accounts of Mission life provide a much-needed antidote to the idealization and denial and Eurocentric bias that saturate most Mission histories.<br />If you want to know Southern California better, then of course you must stand on her soil and listen to her voices; but you could do much worse for an intro-at-a-distance than this fine book, which fellow natives will find confirming and eye-opening.outhern California better, then of course you must stand on her soil and listen to her voices; but you could do much worse for an intro-at-a-distance than this fine book, which fellow natives will find confirming and eye-opening.	2001-11-21

I do not accept the justification that complex philosophical matters require bad writing. Prose loaded with twenty-cent words and pompous jargon is not only a poor start for the struggling student, but an unwitting comment on the writer's capacity for the kind of pompous intellectualizing that drives students and seekers OUT of philosophy.<br />With the exception of essayists Nancy Love and Simone Chambers, most of the contributors to this troublesome tome need to go back to Strunk and White, William Zinsser, and basic English composition to learn how NOT to write sentences like this one:<br />&quot;The insight of the metacritique of pure reason is that the comprehensiveness of a system of reason cannot be predicated on comprehensiveness itself, and that a certain amount of incomprehensibility is necessary to make 'systematic' or 'complete comprehension' possible.&quot;<br />Setting aside the question of how many times can we work &quot;compre-&quot; into an incomprehensible phrasing, in plain English it means--I think--that a thought system's clarity doesn't guarantee the scope of its applicability.

We had just had a class in psychoanalysis, a useful but highly reductive set of theories and therapies.<br />Although I can't repeat the response here, much as I'd like to, it was splendidly animated, asking in essence: if love is all projection, what does that say about the beloved--HER feelings, HER reality?<br />Although you can't know the St. Elmo's Fire that cavorts from the very windows wherever Dr. Goodchild speaks unless you're there to have your hair raised by it, the passion behind it lights this fine book of hers, in which Sekmet and Shakti, angels and aliens rise like currents of celestial fire to charge the dance of Chaos and Eros, the mythic pair so often pushed off the dance floor by Chaos and Order or just Order, finally a solo in the positivist pageants of our time, so addicted are we to programs, lists, and control, we heirs to Apollo and Rome.<br />And so the Chaos we try to arrange out of our lives and relationships (thereby depotentiating both) breaks in again in unexpected places, angered at going unrecognized, eager to initiate us into a richer and more genuine--and more tumultuous--kind of Eros than we're used to. For there's no such thing as a safe love, or a truly orderly vocation. Would we want them if there could be?<br />Some of my classmates question whether depth-related learnings are still relevant, what with falling bombs, terrorist attacks, a literal anthrax to match the psychic poisoning of our era. In and below such surface-level cataclysms and the pain they involve Dr. Goodchild reads the re-emergence of a long-repressed cosmological love intimately bound up with everything else we've managed to marginalize: the fleshly, the feminine, the esoteric, the earthly, the imaginal. To quote from the book:<br />&quot;Could it be that the chaos of our world, losing its way in breakdowns on all levels from the personal to the political, from the cultural to the geophysical, signals that moment of deadly peril where collective consciousness seeks its own destruction and dissolution, in order to birth a relation to this complex Mystery, a connection that we can only approach, that we can only forge, with an attitude born of a willingness to suffer, and of a love that can only emerge from our grief?&quot;<br />Obviously, this kind of love has nothing to do with a manically optimistic &quot;everything is love, man&quot;; its wellsprings are deeper and its cost far higher than anything rainbow stickers and positive affirmations could tap.<br />&quot;Love is a paradox and evokes all our shadows.

(A newcomer to Ibn 'Arabi's writings, I'm reviewing this book from a depth-psychological point of view.)<br />If you've read my other reviews you know I'm a relentless critic of unreadable writing, much of which is symptomatic of a narcissistic unavailability better dealt with in therapy than through a publisher or fan club.  Corbin is not easy to follow in places, but it's the concentration of the material that makes for more careful study--and makes more careful study worthwhile.<br />I was particularly moved by the image of the saddened God breathing out a sigh at being unknown, a sigh that made space for humans to reflect God back to God and thereby become the &quot;secret treasure.&quot;  Corbin's criticism of &quot;becoming one with God&quot; mirrors Buber's of &quot;doctrines of absorption&quot;:  both praise a dialog between person and the Divine rather than a reduction of one to the other.<br />Note to students of James Hillman:  while many of Hillman's ideas can be found here (the heart as an organ of soulful perception, for instance), Ibn 'Arabi makes a clear, non-Hillmanic distinction between Forms (Images) of God and the ineffable true God that shines through the Forms like light through stained glass.  This distinction does not exist for archetypal psychology, which collapses the archetypal image into the archetype itself and regards extra-psychic activities as outside its purview.	2001-10-23

Although it's nicely written and photographed, NO book reissued these days as a historical outline or overview has ANY business referring to Native Californians as &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;childlike&quot; or the colors of their artwork as &quot;barbaric.&quot;<br />As for 90% of these &quot;simple&quot; people with a rich cultural and spiritual life having been wiped out through warfare, culture shock, deicide, and disease, the authors weigh in on the pro-mission anti-mission argument by resorting to this supposedly measured justification:<br />&quot;...the treatment of natives by the Spaniards, though open to criticism by modern standards of political morality, was certainly no worse than that practiced in other colonial empires of the time.  Slavery was condoned by all the world empires until late in the 19th century...Basically, the conflict of Spaniard vs. Indian was that of two cultures widely separated in style but fated to collide, and the reduction of the weaker by the stronger was inevitable.&quot;<br />To argue that one form of subjugation is &quot;no worse&quot; than another, or that it was an inevitable result of the meeting of two cultures, is a cynical--no, a despicable hypothesis; and until this racist book is rewritten to eradicate these irresponsible &quot;reasons&quot; for ruthless colonialism, I urge the potential reader not to buy it.

It should be considered &quot;unrated&quot; by me because I seldom feel comfortable assigning numbers to people's memoirs.<br />----------------------------<br />In a country possessed by the demon of efficiency, it's easy to forget that in the aftermath of tragedy, it's normal to alternate between mourning and cheer.  Instead, we tend to derail both by stuffing the need to mourn; the tears denied then turn into anxiety, heavy-heartedness, or even depression, one reason Prozac is so popular in a country that will not let mourning work itself out naturally.  (&quot;Break down&quot;; &quot;losing it&quot;:  what mechanistic metaphors for what in other cultures is so natural an opportunity to grow through initiation!)<br />Some books do a good job of helping us greet our mourning--Romanyshyn's THE SOUL IN GRIEF, C. S. Lewis's A GRIEF OBSERVED, etc.  But they aren't so great at reacquainting us with the crazy, funny, absurd side of the tragic--and that's where this conversationally written book comes in.<br />In it you will meet various characters.  The first is the author, whom you might already know through her Saturday Night Live persona and her various performances.  You will meet her parents, who bestow upon her the fabulous unasked-for blessing of moving in for a while.  You will meet Rita, who needs a wig, and Gus, who eats out a lot.  And you will meet Mike, diagnosed with lymphatic cancer around the time that the author is diagnosed with a rarer kind.<br />Incidentally, you will also meet the Pope, the author's favorite person in all the world.  Well, not the Pope himself, but one of his books, to which the author had a strong reaction when she picked it up at the bookstore.  (Funny thing:  I picked up one of his books once and had the same reaction.  There must be something about his aura of benevolence that brings that out in people.)<br />At a time when more and more public figures bash parents and ex-lovers in the name of &quot;speaking my truth&quot; (&quot;venting my spleen&quot; would be more accurate), the author has a nice way of writing personably about loved ones and their foibles without demonizing anyone.<br />To those stern folks who don't think that even death can be laughed at, I can only commend the words of Robin Williams:  &quot;Joke 'em if they can't take a f---.&quot;parents and ex-lovers in the name of &quot;speaking my truth&quot; (&quot;venting my spleen&quot; would be more accurate), the author has a nice way of writing personably about loved ones and their foibles without demonizing anyone.  <br />To those stern folks who don't think that even death can be laughed at, I can only commend the words of Robin Williams:  &quot;Joke 'em if they can't take a f---.&quot;	2001-09-30

Oh, and 3. the publisher needs to spend more on the paper:  it's no good for penciling notes on.<br />I'm not certain that the question of the integrity of one's work comes down to the quality of one's attention, as the author seems to maintain.  The dilemma, say, of a scientist who designs nuclear weapons and then realizes one day--perhaps when jobs are scarce--that the work is eating up his soul even though it supports his family becomes a real dilemma, not only a problem of the ego that vanishes in the light of understanding.  Doing a job he feels to be evil consciously doesn't make it any less evil to him; and consciously quitting and letting his family starve while he looks for work hugely impacts them.  In fact, it's his heightened awareness and its unwillingness to &quot;turn away from truth&quot; that deprives him of his ability to feel good about his integrity no matter what he decides.<br />Needleman is right, though, that we must make peace with our relationship with money if we're to heal the split between our physical requirements and our thirst for meaning.  To do that we need more, not less, &quot;materialism,&quot; a more conscious probing into matter, the body, the things of the world, which today's electronicized economics have gone far toward dematerializing.<br />The book reminds me a bit of a quotation by Walter Kaufmann, who wrote about Shakespeare's solution to the dilemma of vocation vs. occupation (remember that, like Beethoven, the world's pre-eminent playwright was also an efficient businessman):<br />It has almost become a commonplace that the modern artist<br />has lost contact with his audience and that the public no<br />longer supports him as in previous ages...Shakespeare came<br />to terms with the obtuseness of his public: he gave his pearls<br />a slight odor of the sty before he cast them.

For this reason the psychotherapist must taken environment into much greater account than has previously been attempted.<br />The author's equation of mental health with freedom parallels liberation psychology's emphasis on addressing the social conditions that make for physical and mental suffering.<br />This book was first published in 1968, and it's in need of updating.  Contributions not only from lib psych but also from archetypal psychology, which &quot;tends the soul of the world,&quot; and from ecopsychology and ecofeminism might be included as well.<br />Even so, most of the conditions described by the author--widespread poverty, power politics that keep it in place, the elitism of the psychotherapist, the indifference of the medical establishment--have remained in place.

It's not.  In fact, the suggestions offered by the author throughout the book are relevant, doable, sensible, and verifiable.  Grouping the outside forces that make for violence into six Pathways to Prison, Dr. Kipnis goes on to explain what they look and feel like from inside the young rager--and it is that part we sorely lack in our sorry stabs at &quot;explaining&quot; youth violence from the outside, its perpetrators objects to be warehoused for a profit as slave labor.<br />Most of the violent males I've counseled have already done jail or prison time--and yet even with them, listening carefully, confronting them firmly and respectfully with the consequences of their behavior, educating them about basics like managing addictions and painful emotions, and showing them that strong males can be gentle, patient, and nonviolently assertive gave our counseling center (Cornerstone) close to a 90% success rate (meaning:  90% men who completed the full program never reviolated their probation).  I wish I'd had this book available then, for them and for me.  So much more can be done with young men before they ever get to this point!<br />Dr. Kipnis is President of the Fatherhood Coalition, a nonprofit that among other things encourages fathers to be an active, available part of their childrens' lives.  I can tell you that of the hundreds of violent men I've worked with, not one--not one!--had had an adequate, let alone loving, relationship with his father.  Given our country of unavailable dads (and moms, of course), do you begin to see why more young men are imprisoned in the US than were locked up in pro-aparteid Africa?<br />This and other dynamics behind the immense problem of young male violence are explained in this book with clarity, erudition, and personal experiences convincing far beyond the usual theoretical models.<br />The Talmud talks about the &quot;Master of Return,&quot; the man who took the wrong way and then found the right way; in the eyes of God such a man stands higher than even the angels in heaven.  One such man has penned this book, as you'll see for yourself when you read it.

Jung: His Myth in Our Time (Studies in Jungian Psychology by Jungian Analysts)	Books	2	22	30	N	N	an extended study in idealization	The author, who is one of THE most under-rated and under-written-about female theorists who studied under Jung (where is there a substantial biography for her??), is always brilliant to read, her work packed with fascinating insights and an almost superhuman erudition.  This book is no exception.<br />At the same time, however, it gets nowhere near the quality of her other books.  Propped up by endless quotes from Jung's supposedly autobiographical MEMORIES, DREAMS, REFLECTIONS, a book I often go back to but always with the knowledge that it's been heavily censored, von Franz sustains a justificatory tone throughout that is embarrassing to read.<br />At one point, for instance, she deals with the accusation that Jung had anti-Semitic tendencies, perhaps because he had some shadow issues to work on.  She quashes this notion strenuously and puts it all down to Jung's &quot;optimism&quot; and tendency to say too much (not to mention his opponents' projections...always a good place to go when defending one's allies).  God forbid that Jung should cast a shadow!<br />It saddens me that von Franz so seldom struck out on her own without checking in with Jung first or crediting him with the tremendous innovations she brought to his thinking.  But nowhere is her unwillingness to question Jung more evident here, where scarcely a paragraph escapes the praise piled high on the Great Man's head.<br />That he was a great man, a truly daimonic genius who gave us the golden key to transpersonal symbolism, does not change the fact that he was a human being who could be narcissistic, irritable, arrogant, impatient, misogynistic, intolerant, racist, bad-tempered, and downright cruel to the women he supposedly loved.<br />When I write I often refer to teachers who've impacted my insights about human nature; ordinarily, it would be inconsiderate for me to bring in their human flaws and blind spots.  But were I to undertake a biography of any of them once they had shuffled off the mortal coil, it would be incumbent upon me not to whitewash them.  You will find many interesting observations about Jung's life in this book; but the picture it offers of him is thoroughly one-sided.coil, it would be incumbent upon me not to whitewash them.

It reads like a professional journal article, and it's difficult at first to feel confidence in a writer who won't write a paragraph without packing it with references.  But this reminded me about the entrenched prevalence of male pedanticism in fields of social and psychological endeavor.  You are free to write informal and yet scholarly books if you're Kirkpatrick Sale or Joseph Campbell or Isaac Asimov; but, tragically, it's still an uphill battle for women to publish works as comprehensive as this without recourse to a literary style that reeks of hierarchy and nomenclature.<br />Never mind that.  The information packed into this otherwise readable book makes the journey well worthwhile, and its author does a fine job of touching on the key points of each theorist without getting lost in what could be endless elaborations.  If you are interested in understanding and fighting the psychology of oppression, patriarchal or otherwise, or are actively working with people who are, then this book belongs on your desk.	2001-08-31

For that reason I've been suspicious of supposed parallels between, say, quantum physics and psychodynamics (e.g., referring to insights as collapsing wave packets). Psyche we can feel and breathe; physics remains &quot;experience-distant,&quot; to use Kohut's term.<br />This book convinced me that complexity (or &quot;chaos&quot;) theory affords a workable bridge between these two realms. The author ably translates concepts not only from psychology, but from ecology, politics, and even shamanism into a non-reductive systems framework with which we can grasp the interface between mind and milieu, the while avoiding the EITHER experience-distant OR experience-near split that runs through so much postmodern thought. For that alone I would rate this book highly.<br />Moreover, these theoretical discoveries and speculations are applied to urgent contemporary crises like warfare, poverty, and social injustice, framing them as our unconscious attempt to push an overly rigid, &quot;high-grid&quot; civilization closer to the edge of chaos, where new channels of information can open and correct systemic imbalances.<br />Even biology plays its part in this coevolutionary swirl. Why, for instance, does an illness like schizophrenia, widely and accurately linked to brain dysfunction, nevertheless have such a low recovery rate in the West compared to &quot;undeveloped&quot; nations where the mentally ill are the focus of healing ceremonies performed by the entire community? Why in the West do we reduce mental life to brain instead of emphasizing that neural tissue is also transformed by our experiences? To what degree are affective disorders a symptom of the repressed urge to connect, an urge that when frustrated for too long surfaces in distorted guises like widespread mood disorders, mass movements, ideologies, isms?<br />Be aware that this isn't a book for readers new to science.

Here are some illustrative quotations:<br />My practice tells me I can no longer distinguish clearly between neurosis of self and neurosis of world, psychopathology of self and psychopathology of world.  Moreover, it tells me that to place neurosis and psychopathology solely in personal reality is a delusional repression of what is actually, realistically, being experienced.<br />The world, because of its breakdown, is entering a new moment of consciousness:  by drawing attention to itself by means of its symptoms, it is becoming aware of itself as a psychic reality.<br />Let us imagine the anima mundi [world soul] neither above the world encircling it as a divine and remote emanation of spirit, a world of powers, archetypes, and principles transcendent to things, nor within the material world as its unifying panpsychic life-principle.  Rather let us imagine the anima mundi as that particular soul-spark, that seminal image, which offers itself through each thing in its visible form.	2001-08-15

Although well and clearly written, as all his books are (just reading his sentences can be a joy), he left behind many of its major premises long ago, a fact he recapitulates in a Postscript added in 1994.<br />For instance, in contrast to what this book presents:<br />1.  &quot;Soul&quot; was a word he liked to use in the 60's, whereas now he talks about &quot;psyche.&quot;<br />2.  Soul here is to be explored by an &quot;insearch&quot; (as opposed to &quot;research&quot;), a turning within.  Soul in the world is not mentioned--or as Hillman writes about himself with such a severe tone, &quot;The author doesn't even get to the window.&quot;<br />3.  What Jung called &quot;the shadow&quot; is also in the world, not just in us as a moral problem.<br />4.  Soul is not something lost that must be found (the Christianistic premise, God forbid).  It is evident everywhere, within and without, and most particularly within our symptoms.<br />5.  Psyche is a &quot;third&quot; between matter and spirit.  (I have to bark here.  Hillman's notion of &quot;spirit&quot; is everything the mystics say isn't spiritual:  order, literality, authority, mentality, rationality... But I'd agree that psyche is a third between matter and mind.  Because all this senex stuff is mind, not spirit.)<br />Etc.<br />For students of Hillman and archetypal psychology, the book might make an excellent contrast between his very early and more traditional Jungian thought and his more radical, later, re-visioning psychological polytheism.  Otherwise, you're better off with his later work:  gems like THE DREAM AND THE UNDERWORLD, RE-VISIONING PSYCHOLOGY, INTER VIEWS, THE THOUGHT OF THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE WORLD, and THE SOUL'S CODE.	2001-08-12

It is a nice study of power and its intricacies from a depth-psychological, multidisciplinary, poetic perspective.  A reader new to Hillman won't find this work as technical as others (e.g., Re-Visioning Psychology).<br />As someone who worked in Corporate America for 15 years, I feel uncomfortable with psychologizing repetition, control, leadership, etc. without giving due emphasis to the enormously widespread pain and suffering these cause to those of us subjected to them by bosses who belong in daily therapy but are too narcissistic to ever go there.  It's very nice to link up repetition with a deep need to polish, or to give a nod to the &quot;born&quot; leader--but unless we also emphasize the shadow side of these states and qualities, they all get taken right to the bank.  I must say I'm glad that some of the people I've had to report to never came across this book; they'd have used it as an excuse to be MORE controlling, intrusive, demanding, and downright tyrannical.<br />I can't quite figure out why Hillman wrote this book.  His nod to people in business, maybe?  An attempt to explain a bit of psychology to them?  Surprising to see the Nietzsche of depth psychology offering so many of what look like justifications for precisely the kind of corporate behavior that drives people into stress disabilities and two of my own colleagues into suicide.	2001-08-10

Nevertheless, the idea that standards from outside drive a gifted student to despair takes on new prophetic meaning as the current U.S. government strives to force all students (and teachers) into standardized measurements that can only shame those who do not &quot;measure up&quot; or whose uncalculatable gifts--you know, artistic talent, intuition, faith, courage, imagination, passion, idealism, love of learning--all that trivial stuff--will now fall ever more deeply into the cultural shadow.<br />Later in his life, Hesse saw his early novels as hopelessly bourgeois.  Some critics have followed him in this, but it's simply wrong.  He always wrote from the heart; the difference is that the later novels spring from a heart fully cracked open.<br />BENEATH THE WHEEL reflects the beginnings of that painful opening up to wider vistas for the author....and, it is hoped, for the reader as well.	2001-07-29

It is.<br />Freud has an uncanny habit of failing to interpret the symbolism of his own theoretical work.  The split Moses, based on the primal father (see Totem and Taboo) killed and eaten by rebellious sons:  what more accurate picture could the reader want of the fate of Freud's Wednesday Psychological Society and its rebellious offspring?<br />Stylistically, however, Freud reads a bit like Conan Doyle, and the interest he creates with his detective-story reasoning is matched only by his immense lucidity and command of the written word.	2001-07-23

Hesse was such a man, of course.  As the book's fictional bourgeois narrator says about Harry Haller:<br />...He called himself the Steppenwolf, and this too estranged and disturbed me a little. What an expression! However, custom did not only reconcile me to it, but soon I never thought of him by any other name; nor could I today hit on a better description of him. A wolf of the steppes that had lost its way and strayed into the towns and the life of the herd, a more striking image could not be found for his shy loneliness, his savagery, his restlessness, his homesickness, his homelessness....<br />He also has this to say, and for me this beautifully sums up the novel's impact:<br />And now we come to these records of Haller's, these partly diseased, partly beautiful, and thoughtful fantasies...I see them as a document of the times, for Haller's sickness of the soul, as I now know, is not the eccentricity of a single individual, but the sickness of the times themselves, the neurosis of that generation to which Haller belongs, a sickness, it seems, that by no means attacks the weak and worthless only but, rather, precisely those who are strongest in spirit and richest in gifts. These records...are an attempt to present the sickness itself in its actual manifestation. They mean, literally, a journey through hell, a sometimes fearful, sometimes courageous journey through the chaos of a world whose souls dwell in darkness, a journey undertaken with the determination to go through hell from one end to the other, to give battle to chaos, and to suffer torture to the full.<br />--And yet, and yet...Hesse later wrote a beautiful Author's Note in which he emphasized that to descend is not enough; to live in shadows and be eccentric and feel despair...no, that's not the novel's destiny and shouldn't be the reader's either.  Here is the last piece of that Note which expresses Hesse's view of regarding the work as only doomful:<br />These readers, it seems to me, have recognized themselves in the Steppenwolf, identified themselves with him, suffered his griefs, and dreamed his dreams; but they have overlooked the fact that this book knows of and speaks about other things besides Harry Haller and his difficulties, about a second, higher, indestructible world beyond the Steppenwolf and his problematic life. The &quot;Treatise&quot; and all those spots in the book dealing with matters of the spirit, of the arts and the &quot;immortal&quot; men oppose the Steppenwolf's world of suffering with a positive, serene, superpersonal and timeless world of faith. This book, no doubt, tells of griefs and needs; still, it is not a book of a man despairing, but of a man believing.<br />Of course, I neither can nor intend to tell my readers how they ought to understand my tale.

But he should not be in the position of expecting us to believe them without proof.<br /><br />It doesn't surprise me that he hid from the public.  He'd have been asked embarrassing questions like:  why all the inconsistencies throughout your books, some of them really rather flagrant?  Are your writings scholarship or fiction?  Why have you not informed the reader of the genre in which you believe you work?  Why did you play such a dumb Watson to don Juan's Sherlock Holmes of the spirit?

Another outstanding example is Gurdjief, who after bragging at length about his ability to flummox people turns around and asks for belief in the mystical brotherhood he supposedly encountered in the mountains.

However, aside from the relatively minor matter of rather slapdash editing, what I find objectionable is the job she did on her ex-partner.<br />When you get into a relationship, even one with a celebrity, it ought to be understood that the intimate details and conflicts will not, at some point, be turned into a book and displayed to the public.  All through this book I wondered:  how does Julie Cypher feel about this kind of glaring exposure?  And even if she agreed to such an expose and applauded every word, how will their children feel about it?  Can you imagine growing up knowing that EVERYBODY sees you as the child of one parent who apparently had numerous affairs and of another who told the entire world about it?<br />For that reason I regard books like this as mean-spirited.  It's certainly not right to be lied to and cheated on, but that does not in any way authorize this kind of hitting back.  Better, and more healthy, to deal with the problems assertively as they arise rather than store up a huge fund of anger and let it fly like this.<br />I continue to love the author's music, but I'm extremely disappointed that she has chosen to write such a book under cover of &quot;letting it all out&quot; or being on a journey of healing.  And while there is much to be said for the bravery of allowing one's fans to learn from one's personal difficulties--and Lord knows Melissa has been through enough to make her an expert on suffering and abuse--there is nothing helpful or healing in shaming ex-partners.	2001-07-22

He is correct, however, that the American Eagle is an appropriate symbol for our nation:  not for the reason he states (arrows in one talon and olive branch in the other), but because the eagle ours resembles, the Imperial Eagle of Rome, flapped its wings over another militarized and hubris-infected empire bent on political and economic domination (nowadays called &quot;global leadership&quot;).<br />Books like THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES and THE POWER OF MYTH provide less biased introductions to Campbell's thought...and in fairness to him, he did grow beyond some of those biases, as is evident in video interviews conducted in his later years.	2001-07-20

That people still defend such intolerant theses in order to justify The System As It Is goes farther to prove Freire's points than Freire did himself (although on occasion he humorously acknowledged this kind of &quot;help&quot;).<br />Freire looked forward to the day when people would understand the poor and the marginalized through THEIR eyes and hearts instead of passing judgment on them or ignoring the social context of their misery....something Jesus was known to be in favor of.  But this requires the risk and the labor of giving up a lot of illusions and actually being with these people and imaginatively feeling how they live, and why.	2001-07-07

Sometimes it takes genius, and heart, to say what everyone already knows but can't quite vocalize.  Education that takes the person's needs and social context into account; that helps him through dialog rather than imposing top-down curriculums in order to fit him to the rhythms of the dominant socioeconomic powers; that challenges him to think critically about his place in society and the world (&quot;conscientization&quot;); that encourages him to envision what he can do, where he can go....it took Paulo Freire not just to express these laudable goals, but to show us through his work how he actually helped accomplish them among people written off as inferior peasants with no voice in world affairs.<br />Famous for his book PEDAGOGY OF THE OPPRESSED, kicked out of countries for daring to train farm workers and laborers in literacy and critical appraisal, Paulo Freire takes us behind the scenes and shows us what he was thinking, doing, and feeling throughout his long and radical career.<br />Reading his other work, one might have guessed, say, that when he was much younger, the good doctor was blasted during a lecture on Piaget by a laborer who stood up and asked him on what side of town Freire lived and whether HIS household crammed several unwashed and hungry children into one room.  But such anecdotes are of invaluable worth in showing how Freire learned what he learned--painfully.<br />That the reader can sense in his wordplay that finally the man who'd done so much for others took this opportunity to wane autobiographical may cause a smile or two.  But it shouldn't be mistaken for narcissism or pomposity.  An activist and faithholder in people oppressed and in despair has earned the right to his eloquence, and it's nice to feel him enjoying it here and there.<br />For the student of human nature, Freire's own (alas, briefly mentioned) childhood of poverty and early struggles will be of interest thanks to Freire's own take:  that these didn't determine his later life so much as gave him tools with which to empathize with other marginalized people.  Reading this, I thought of James Hillman's &quot;acorn&quot; notion:  that the soul comes into life knowing what it needs, even if it needs unsparing adversity.  To a man like Freire, adversity is not an &quot;opportunity&quot;--a manically cheery thesis--so much as the canvas from which he works.ater life so much as gave him tools with which to empathize with other marginalized people.

This book avoids that error by placing even emphasis on what happens inside the patient and between patient and therapist.  The authors blend self psychology, object relations, and other fields to lay out an elegant exploration of interacting subjectivities.<br />The conceptualization of psychopathology as either pathological structure OR missing psychic structure is particularly helpful and shows the common ground between self psychology (which tends to see things in terms of disintegration) and object relations (which at its worst regards the patient as a person full of toxic objects...a convenient notion when the therapy isn't going well!).<br />The authors also contend that selfobject transferences aren't so much a type of transference as a dimension that runs through all transferences--indeed, all relationships to varying degrees.<br />The book starts out with a lot of philosophy, in order to establish a context for perspectives presented later.  Some of it was interesting, but most a rehash.<br />The only real problem I had with this book is that it wasn't long enough.  So I guess I'll have to read more books by these authors.	2001-07-03

But the book's first half is mostly chapters written to defend various Kohutian self-psych concepts from misunderstanding critics.  The defenses are theoretical and philosophical with a few extremely brief case examples thrown in.  Many words on the nature of theories and theorizing, too few of clinical substance until the final few papers.<br />As long as so much defense was going on, why not include a reply to Kernberg's criticism that self-psychological case examples tend to reflect an unwillingness to interpret rage?  In the case example of a borderline patient on p. 133, the client's &quot;apparent&quot; cure and later regression is explained in part by the therapist's (and patient's) shifting perspectives--but the mention of rage is conspicuously absent.  Did the therapist ever deal with it?  If so, how?  One suspects not but cannot tell.<br />I don't plan on reading more of Goldberg's books unless a reader of this review can recommend one more specific to self psychological cases and concepts and less expository on notions that might concern philosophically-minded therapists but will not concern their patients.	2001-06-30

Whether the mood is justified is another matter.  In this case, it would seem so.  Jacoby presents convincing examples of how thoroughly the psychologies he discusses sell themselves out to the economic and political machinery of civilization--while regarding themselves as tools of &quot;authenticity,&quot; &quot;awakening,&quot; &quot;sensitivity,&quot; and &quot;self-realization.&quot;<br />One example:  by insisting on these nice goals in the face of, say, corporate takeovers, the implication is that the pain people feel is entirely subjective.  By focusing on finding &quot;meaning&quot; and a &quot;new attitude&quot; in the face of societally inflicted adversity, psychologists do their part in making that adversity seem like business as usual rather than a form of injustice that ought to be protested.  (Compare this with Martin-Baro's insight that plenty of psychological pain is actually psychosocial rather than individual.)<br />Fromm, Maslow, and Rogers get a particularly bad beating, and perhaps their counter-phobic and regressive cheeriness deserves it.  Nevertheless, it's painful to see such pummelings inflicted on these men.  I can see using sarcasm and irony on, say, the get-rich-and-grow notions of a Deepak Chopra.  Salesmen like him are asking for it.  The same with all these &quot;we make our reality&quot; New Agers whose mania is matched only by their denial.  But Abe Maslow?<br />In his desire to unmask the humanists and neoanalysts as hypocrites and philosophical dilettantes, Jacoby says next to nothing about their accomplishments--Karen Horney's modification of Freud's useless theory of women, Fromm's illumination of the flight from freedom, etc.  Nor about Freud's shortcomings, his reductionism in particular.  The word doesn't even appear in the index.  Cutting criticism serves a useful purpose, but this verges on throwing out the baby with the bathwater.<br />Even so, Jacoby's concise, forcible, organized prose is a pleasure to read, even when one flinches at a particularly scathing observation.reedom, etc.  Nor about Freud's shortcomings, his reductionism in particular.

Is the somatic component there?  The cognitive?  And, since affect involves an object, is the object relation there too?  If not, how far from consciousness?  What defenses protect it?<br />The book is organized into sections on the role of affects, developmental aspects of broad-spectrum personality disorders (not necessarily (thank God) in the DSM sense), clinical applications of object relations theory (discusses the transference, structural change, and other such considerations), technical approaches to severe regression, and the dynamics of sexual perversion.<br />In this last section, Kernberg mentions that per classic analytic thought, homosexuality = unresolved Oedipal conflict.  The man who loves a man is actually submitting to dad and thereby failing to identify with him and grow up.  Explaining that the biological and clinical evidence is not yet in, Kernberg states, honestly enough, that in his clinical experience few homosexual men fail to present significant character pathology.  But would a psychologically mature homosexual want to do therapy to begin with, especially within a tradition known to see homosexuality as infantile?  And if the &quot;I've always been like this&quot; explanation given by my clients is true--and I think it is--then how is one to entirely escape significant pathology while growing up gay in a homophobic society?  Unfortunately, these questions are not addressed in this otherwise indispensable work.<br />An extra gift is the author's obvious willingness to see beyond even the most destructive behaviors to the sense and suffering at their core.ift is the author's obvious willingness to see beyond even the most destructive behaviors to the sense and suffering at their core.	2001-06-04

But the constant references to them throughout the analytic literature get one wondering about a sort of theoretical perversity, a morbid preoccupation with the shadows of love to the cost of illuminating its joys and burning passions.<br />Though a brilliant thinker, Kernberg occasionally shares the analytic tendency to be centuries behind everyone else.  For instance, he recognizes his debt to Stoller, who maintains that erotic love must have &quot;mystery,&quot; and to Balint for his emphasis on &quot;tenderness.&quot;  Nor will the reader gasp in admiration to learn that self-love and love of others develop together and enrich one another.  Sorry, but these are NOT revelations--except to a discipline so tradition-bound that only its own coinages are acceptable currency.  (Methinks analysts could learn a lot from the Vatican's attitude toward Galileo.)<br />Nor will the tiresome equation of homosexuality with unsatisfactory object relations prove helpful, least of all to LGBT couples.<br />Kernberg shines best here in discussing narcissistic and superego influences on relationships.  He also makes the case that society tends to attack love relationships, which for that reason need to fortify and ground themselves.<br />If you're looking for more, I recommend the generally non-reductive ART OF LOVING by Fromm.	2001-05-19

Others will welcome the exposition of why dreams do what they do.<br />Dreams, not just as imaginal compensations for the narrowness of conscious daily life, but as completions, as fillings-in to be lived as night-time dramas; dreams as metaphoric missing pieces of what we neglect in our journeys toward wholeness; as messages, or letters, in the Talmudic sense, we must open to understand:  all this is here, and warmly recommended.<br />I can't write a book review without at least a brief comment on style.  In this case, nothing close to the poetry of a Hillman or a Romanyshyn.  Adequately expository, though.  They do a good job of seeing to it that the reader gets the ideas.<br />The authors claim to have written for clinicians, but the educated non-therapist unacquainted with the tools of dreamlife can find real gold in this book.<br />If you're curious beyond the simple &quot;did I dream that because I ate a bad hamburger&quot; or &quot;I can't understand my dreams, so they don't make any sense,&quot; then begin here.	2001-04-08

Simply written, mythically convincing, and conveying an idea--Gaia--so evident to the intuitive feel of life here that it's hard even to summon the will to question it.<br />Lovelock treads difficult ground.  Apparently unaware of depth psychology's amplifications of the &quot;anima mundi,&quot; the World Soul described by Plato and so many aboriginal socities, Lovelock seeks to move the proof into the realm of science without sounding--in this book--overly scientific.<br />One could wish he'd dreamed into the Gaia image more deeply and less literally.  At the same time, empirical research could go a long way toward establishing the systemic, globe-regulating processes he envisions in this book.  Whether such science would convince those who benefit financially from colonizing and exploiting the world's resources is open to question.<br />While I don't share the author's optimistic belief in Gaia's capacity to regulate herself despite our ever-increasing power to disrupt her systems, I admire the attempt to give current form to an ancient idea...an idea with tremendous archetypal punch and relevancy.<br />If you buy this book, use it as a point of departure--into biology, ecology, or ecopsychology, perhaps.

In that sense the book is an invaluable milestone.  Because of this, it poses liberation (in the sense of liberation from oppressive social conditions like poverty and tyranny) as an intellectual issue, historically and theologically.  Correction:  it appeals to an intellectual understanding of what the author obviously has lived and felt very deeply.<br />Having just read LOVE IN A TIME OF HATE, I bought this book expecting to read flesh-and-blood examples of liberation theology as brought into the streets.  You won't find much of that here.  It's more of an account of how the movement has gone on in circles theological.  As such, it poses vital questions to believers and clergy alike--questions of conscience, questions of the relevance of Scripture and the risks involved in living a Christian life of service and conscience in perilous situations.	2001-04-08

People of nature, enviously demonized as childlike or primitive, suffer like the rest of us--but why do they do without neuroses and eating disorders, mass murder and organized intolerance?<br />Because it's our cultural separation from the seas and stars that makes us mad, and WE are the culture.

Listening to the soul of the world, Chellis Glendinning hears in it an anguish echoing her own--and acts bravely and actively on behalf of both.<br />There's an annoying idea at my school (Pacifica) that all such activism = acting out, a kind of puerile and heroic impulsiveness--whereas working the imaginal, perhaps from within a well-lighted office on convenient days, should be enough.  The example of the author's way of being indicates otherwise.  We certainly need to monitor our activism, lest it become just another kind of colonizing arrogance so characteristic of our empire-driven civilization; at the same time, to say and do nothing except in private is not enlightened or soulful, it is cowardly.<br />Good work, Dr. Glendinning!	2001-02-15

A question for me was whether the numen and the mainstream really have much to do with one another, and if so, how.<br />As a man who has practiced psychotherapy from a depth perspective, I couldn't subscribe to the metaphor of our psychological makeup as a pitted driveway down which we make our gradual way Home--the idea being neither to speed up the drive (yes, I can see that) nor to focus so much on the bumps (hm...).  It seems to me that when we substitute attentiveness for wallowing or victim-thinking, we find in those inconvenient and efficiency-impairing bumps what we banish from our ego-dominated daily consciousness.  As Jung pointed out, gods and goddesses--marginalized meanings and secret magic--dwell in our wounds and weaknesses.  While there's much to be said for mental and spiritual health, I'm no more a fan of the &quot;work through and transcend forever&quot; paradigm (which one sees far more often in theory than in life) than I am of the rather Freudian and Americanized Far Eastern view of the unconscious as a dusty warehouse to vacuum out and purify, whether through meditation or psychoanalysis.<br />Nor does such a paradigm offer anything to the homeless person, the victim of violent crime, the pregnant teen who can't read, the patient suffering from a severe personality disorder.  They must get their fulfillment elsewhere, and very often more heroically, if less consistently.  Such people tend not to be taken into account in those developmental schemes of spiritual evolution which become popular and lucrative; and it's to the author's credit that he gives some space to gently explaining some of their rather arrogant shortcomings.<br />Fragmented, distressed, or relatively intact, we are always somewhere within complex and image, psyche and stress; the beauty is in how we come to terms with that and even draw on it in our yearning to host the Sacred shining through it.  &quot;You can make the move to Nirvana,&quot; Hillman writes, &quot;but the gods always find out where you go.&quot;<br />A danger I see in most spiritual practice based on Eastern meditative work is in its purity-loving haste to regard what in the West we think of as &quot;negative&quot; emotions as fleeting states to be observed inwardly and released.  Take anger.  If a boss or a husband or a family member is crashing your boundaries or even mistreating you, feeling through the anger isn't enough.  You have to stand up for yourself.  You have to either kick some ass and change the situation or leave it behind.  I didn't see this addressed by the author, but I can't tell you how many people I've met who believe they can find peace by &quot;changing my attitude&quot; or &quot;becoming mindful.&quot;  It's nice to simply be, but sometimes the way to handle a dilemma is by taking it by the horns.  (&quot;Nothing was ever achieved in this world except by direction action.&quot;  -- Gandhi)<br />The book is particularly valuable as an antidote to so much of the get-there-quick, pie-in-the-sky, manically optimistic fast food on the market today.  The fact is that being spiritual is hard, hard work, effort beyond effort.  There's no way around it, and the author is well aware of that.

This book describes one of his ancestors. There were many Williams and Oranges, but WOO by historical consensus refers to the William who became king of England, Scotland, and Ireland.  That I'm annoyed at having bought it by mistake will therefore be reflected in the tone of this review.<br />Now, it's fine to write in defense of a belief so long as one makes this clear up front. The author didn't. He described this William as a wonderful Christian hero commissioned by God so that wrong might fail and right prevail.<br />I don't mind that the author believes this, but I certainly do mind the lack of objective narrative. True, the book is written for children (another point of annoyance, for it wasn't advertised as such), but all the more reason for at least acknowledging that the wonderful hero was seen--correctly--as an acute religious and political threat by the Catholics of his time. He was no saint; he was a shrewd politician not known for having a mild temper.<br />I would be happier were apologists of a faith to stick to why they find certain people and events meaningful instead of moving right into this &quot;God willed it so&quot; propaganda that rewrites history, blurs the real issues and increases the interfaith intolerance from which the world has suffered too much already. For that reason I certainly wouldn't recommend this book for children. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone, except perhaps as a demonstration of how one can slant a point of view.<br />Was this review sharp enough? &quot;Every bullet has its billet.&quot; -- William of Orange (the real one)	2000-12-28

Are the figures that confront us in the &quot;waking dream&quot; of reverie &quot;only&quot; imagination?  Are they really products of the conscious ego?  Or are they supernatural voices, otherworldly faces?  Perhaps none of these so much as charged personifications who demand to be taken seriously and loaned the respect due any form of creative sentience.<br />It was Freud who outraged us with his psychological notion that we are not necessarily masters in our own &quot;inner&quot; house.  Jung took this a step further by creating tools with which to engage these real figures (for the psychological is THE reality through which we engage our worlds) via dreamwork and fantasy and what he called active imagination.  Dr. Watkins opens this depth-psychological tradition of inquiry into an attentive space in which individuation--or, as she likes to say, liberation--is not a colonial endeavor to conquer lost territory or dredge psychic wreckage to the surface of the mind, but a way of humbly participating as receptive partners in the delicate work of soulmaking, of befriending the Ones who inhabit the same psyche we do...a psyche not bounded by brain or body.<br />For psyche is not in us; we are in it, and invited, should we listen with ears sensitized by Dr. Watkins' suggestions and examples, to a mutuality of enrichment in which we and the imaginal get to know one another.	2000-12-16

What a joy it was to turn away from a discussion with a psychologist who believes in psyche as quantifiable brain extrusion (how come these hermetically sealed folks are always the politically correct ones as well?) and get lost in this wondrous work by a marked man known to frequent the Pacifica Graduate Institute, one of my favorite hangouts and a delphic magnet for depth-oriented subversives.<br />The author has given us a finely researched prose-poem pulsing with creative insights and daring questions:  a psychology of the gut for a malnourished time when so much psychology has become gutless as well as bloodless, dismembered and disembodied.  A time that has recorded the inversion of Jung's dictum that the gods have become diseases, for when &quot;the cry for myth&quot; is strangled in the rationalist throat, diseases inevitably become our gods.<br />A few quotations from the book:<br />&quot;The wound is a special place, a magical place, even a numinous site, an opening where the self and the world may meet on new terms, perhaps violently, so that we are marked out and off, a territory assigned to us that is new, and which forever shifts our tracing in the world.&quot;<br />&quot;Identity involves suffering, a suffering into the self through soul.&quot;<br />&quot;Where we have been marked is where the soft spot of our being is, where we are most finite; but it is also where the hinge is located that marks the pivot of our history and our destiny.&quot;<br />This book won't catch you if you're into trance-ending your wounds and weaknesses, flying over them into a stratospheric spirituality that gleams with powdered sugar and positive thinking:  a Promethean leap that disregards the shadow over which it later stumbles into a deflating, angry bitterness akin to that of Captain Ahab, the idealist-gone wrong who raged, &quot;There can be no hearts above the snowline.&quot;<br />But if you want to listen to the spaces opened up by hurts (&quot;Invulnerable am I only in the heel,&quot; wrote Nietzsche), then this enfleshed poetic journey through literature, myth, and psyche itself will stir your blood and get your soul in motion.nly in the heel,&quot; wrote Nietzsche), then this enfleshed poetic journey through literature, myth, and psyche itself will stir your blood and get your soul in motion.	2000-11-02

It does not compare to Hemingway or Annie Dillard, but it caught me enough to sit in the bathtub and read for two hours in order to finish it.<br />I'll start with the weaknesses:  it read like a bestseller, shallow but entertaining in places.  The author's voice emerged too clearly through the quick summaries of characters better left describing themselves through their actions.  The romantic elements meant to be spicy were tepid, the mandatory violent minidramas rather stock.  The candidate's ideas were sold as a huge novelty; many were not, although I appreciated them and the speeches made for them were clever.  I'm not economist enough to know whether tax breaks could encourage that much innovation.<br />(Note to author if he should read this:  pro assassins tend not to dine with their employers.  Trust me on this.  Very often the real pros never meet or even talk with those who use their services.  Nor do they case important speeches personally, let alone do the killing themselves.  They hire fanatics, one reason the Secret Service employed consulting psychologists to filter through crowds looking for certain expressions, gestures, etc.  Given equipment that can register physiological changes at a distance, I don't know whether they still do.)<br />On the plus side, the plot moved well, the hero seemed noble, the suspense suspended, the sideswipes at attack ads and big-party business-as-usual were accurate and delightful to read, and we got to see exactly what might happen should a third-party man of honesty and integrity decide to try for the American Presidency.<br />Part of the tension involved Edwards' weakness for picking rather sneaky campaign supporters--&quot;beauty pageant operators,&quot; as his wife, the book's voice of reality, tells him.  He should have listened to her.  A candidate who agrees to be &quot;imaged&quot; and &quot;packaged&quot; in a certain manner violates his commitment to be honest to his constituents.  Nothing is less honest than manipulative, mass-appeal advertising.  Edwards believes it is necessary, and for a good cause...but where have we heard that before?  Even the devil has ideals.  Edwards is no devil, but he doesn't realize that playing with words and perceptions is contrary to the democratic spirit and in the end will undermine the &quot;will of the people&quot; our current game-show-host-leaders keep referring to.  (You know, the ones we're Gored by and Bushed with....)<br />A moment of increased honesty emerges when his wife tells him that he loves the admiration.  He does.  But his willingness to compromise opens a weakness in his shining armor wide enough for shadowy people to show up--exemplifying, in psychological terms, the shadows cast by every idealistic leader who fails to take his own narcissism and sleight-of-hand into full account.  In that Edwards is no different from the candidates and conmen he looks down on, the Als who twang their words in the Deep South and the Georges who thump the &quot;family values&quot; bible, except in this:  he is willing to deal squarely with the resulting consequences and unwilling to smear his competitors or cover up his flaws.  &quot;It's not whether you win,&quot; he tells a supporter he fires for unsavory tactics, &quot;but HOW you win.&quot;  Or how you lose, for losing with integrity is no defeat.<br />This book speaks of the need to believe--to believe things CAN be better, that good leadership and beneficial public programs ARE possible.  But if fundamental change is to come to the American people, I don't think it will begin with either politics or economic reform.  However inspiring, an Edwards wouldn't convince as many mainstream voters as he does.  That hurt the book's believability a bit for me.<br />For instance, take the Electoral College, which receives some attention by the author.  The College was set up as a check on mobocracy, on a blind majority overrunning the fragile procedures of a new government.  But it was created in a vastly different age, in which a far smaller country was run largely by white Protestant males.  Despite all the changes and diversifications and expansions since then, however, the College remains.  Why?  Because no one smart or charismatic enough has gotten into politics and done away with it?  No.  Because it dilutes the vote.  Those who lead know very well that putting more weight on electoral votes than popular votes convinces big sectors of the public not to vote at all.  And they know who benefits from that.  Blatant gerrymandering could not be so effective.<br />What's crucial about this is that we put up with it, just as we put up with sloganizing and mud-slinging and a well-panned focus on appearances.  We allow extraverted boys pretending to be men to hold power.  We listen and nod our heads when the Democrats tell us what we want to hear while the Republicans tell us what we wanted to hear fifty years ago.  (The only real difference between the two is that the former wants the government to act like a parent and the latter wants parents to act like the government.)  We put up with it because as they make fools of themselves in the places of power, we realize at some level that the majority of us behave similarly, if less spectacularly, in our own hearts and homes.  We are the leaders we complain about, writ small.<br />Into a nation in which money and appearance are everything and actors and athletes are treated like saints, a brutal, &quot;well, that's business&quot; nation of which Thoreau wrote, &quot;The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation,&quot; comes a real leader, a mature man who refuses to act like a boy and who refuses to entertain us.  We wouldn't vote for him, the majority of us, we'd laugh him off the stage, out of fear, shame--and envy.  We're safe with buffoons and cynics.  Whereas true idealists unwilling to sell out their idealism...well...<br />But it doesn't have to be that way!<br />An Edwards in the political sphere would help.

You really get a feel for how different the situation can be viewed through these three lenses...and for the courage required to present it in innovative and subjective prose not typical of acceptable scholarly &quot;social science.&quot;<br />I found myself put off a bit by what I perceived to be a steady note of defensiveness throughout the book, a tone that felt partly assertive and partly self-justificatory, even in those places where the author emphasized that feminist writers of social science need not accept the academic standards of their male colleagues and critics.  &quot;We don't need no stinking postmodern graybearded men,&quot; it seemed to say in different ways.  At times the sarcasm directed at these critics was quite open, and it distracted me from the excellent content of the author's arguments.<br />I would ask male readers of this book, which I recommend for its fine critiques of the postmodern anthropological tendency to condemn all field research as oppressive colonialism, to bear in mind its context:  namely, thousands of years of patriarchy which we've yet to see any end to, particularly in academia.  And to reflect that we can't dismiss such books as mere axe-grinding, political or otherwise, because while entirely personal bitterness ought to be dealt with personally, this sort affects half of us directly and the other half through collective complicity.  If anything, these axes need to be even sharper.	2000-10-14

I've adjusted my rating of it because it does indeed contrast opposing viewpoints, some of which (as a counselor involved in the field) I continue to find troubling but recognize as valid contributions to this anthology.<br />-------------------------<br />Writers who see domestic violence as an ongoing, serious, criminal activity are contrasted with those who believe it to be exaggerated and overmeasured.  As a man who has worked with both male and female perpetrators as well as a number of male and female victims of domestic violence, I cannot concur with statements that seek to underemphasize the catastrophic impact of what really is a national epidemic.<br />I was particularly dismayed by characterizations of feminists who point out the patriarchal context of DV as so black and white that all men are supposedly regarded as potential batterers and rapists.  I've yet to meet a counselor, critic, or victim advocate of the feminist perspective who really believes this; the relative handful who do tend not to succeed in such an emotional arena, nor do they tend to be trusted by their male and female colleagues.  It is also incorrect to imply that feminists by and large think patriarchy \\"causes\\" DV.  What many maintain rather is that patriarchy forms the context that gives men implicit permission to control women.  DV is merely the extreme example of this kind of male privilege.<br />My own paper emphasizes the need for holding perpetrators accountable for their acts of violence.  And so we should.  But that accountability and those acts exist in a society of outrageous violence and an ongoing unwillingness to take women's claims of male privilege, power, and abuse seriously.  I can't tell you how many battering men have immediately launched into \\"if it weren't for the women's movement\\" or \\"this is all exaggerated\\" or \\"it was OJ's fault that I got arrested,\\" ad nauseum, to justify their own misbehavior.<br />If we are to get a handle on this terrible tragedy of terrorism in our own homes, our own culture, we surely must pay more careful attention to its victims, whose bruised faces and broken bones tell their own tale without recourse to studies or statistics.  For this purpose the book does do an adequate job of presenting these crimes in their actual detail, regardless of those who would minimize them might wish to think.ad nauseum, to justify their own misbehavior.<br />If we are to get a handle on this terrible tragedy of terrorism in our own homes, our own culture, we surely must pay more careful attention to its victims, whose bruised faces and broken bones tell their own tale without recourse to studies or statistics.

This gem is not only well-researched and clearly written; it is a deeply  moving overview of the life of the world's greatest scientist, not just as  a theoretical physicist, but as a human being struggling to be true to  himself in trying times.<br />Although Clark does explain a bit about  special and general relativity, he does so only to aid one's understanding  of why Einstein's contributions were so crucial.  You will see Einstein as  a curious boy, as a troubled student, as a young man making his way in the  world, and then as a post office clerk who worked on physics when his  bosses weren't looking.<br />You will see the tide slowly turn as physicists  of his day began to take this uncredentialled but highly original thinker  seriously.  And then the day dawns when an experiment proves that gravity  indeed bends light....and Einstein wakes up famous.<br />The book is also full  of those charming anecdotes one loves to hear about Einstein, ever the  absent-minded professor and &quot;dropper of conversational bricks,&quot;  such as the performance in which, armed with a violin but off rhythm, the  greatest living physicist is chided by the director:  &quot;Einstein, can't  you count?&quot;<br />What comes through best is Einstein as a great-hearted  and humble man who wanted &quot;to know God's thoughts&quot;; a man of  conscience troubled by the wars and other injustices of his time and  (unlike most of us) actively trying to do something productive about them;  and most of all, a profound man whose central mood, known to every child  but never to be outgrown in the inwardly alive adult, was his loving awe of  the unknown.	2000-09-13

All you'd  need do is invert the criticism, questioning its premises and in effect  turning it back on the critic:  an old philosopher's (and lawyer's) trick  disguising itself as a postmodern innovation.<br />In any case, I don't deny  the necessity for Derrida's work and find various aspects of it challenging  and stimulating.  But I get mightily irritated with the constant word games  best left to poets, most of whom eschew verbosity and ground themselves in  the soil of daily lived and felt experience.  Derrida's gymnastics obscure  what they ought to be clarifying (unless one claims that the point is to  obscure in the name of overturning our usual notions of clarity...see what  I mean?).<br />In Zen, the koan &quot;deconstructs&quot; the student's  stucknesses until nothing is left but the experience; in Derrida,  deconstruction deconstructs even itself until there's nothing left at all.  If intellectually gifted writers are going to resort to such showy  maneuvers, they may be right to object to a charge of nihilistic  grandstanding, but one would hope they'd see the shadow of truth in the  accusation.	2000-06-08

About one man's  journey into the hell of his own being, paralleled only by the hell of a  world he finds no home in; words from Hesse's DEMIAN come to mind:   &quot;My story is not a pleasant one....It is a story of nonsense and  chaos, madness and dreams--like the lives of all men who stop deceiving  themselves.&quot;<br />It's been years since I first came across this  remarkable novel of the archetypally lonely man aptly named the  Steppenwolf, and yet I still recall so much of it, especially the Author's  Note which Hesse wrote when he felt the book was being misunderstood:   pointing out that Harry Haller's (Hermann Hesse's) sufferings were opposed  by a &quot;positive, serene, superpersonal and timeless world of  faith,&quot; Hesse adds, &quot;May everyone find in it what strikes a chord  in him and is of some use to him!

This bears reflection, for people can't be evil, as is  traditionally taught in the Christianized West, in the same way that dirt  is brown... although believing so has salved quite a few consciences and  put a good deal of self-inquiry into one's own less spectacular  destructiveness asleep.	2000-06-03

Judging from the mania and hatred of his tone, Nietzsche was suffering when he wrote this from whatever (syphillis?) would soon destroy his mind. But of course it's impossible to say how much an influence that had no what  he wrote here about Christianity.<br />The book is useful mainly as a study  in how one can fuss and fume at Christianity all one wants, but in the very  forms of our debate we tend to invite in Christian assumptions that have  informed our culture for two millennia.  Nietzsche, who was a pastor's son,  might have given his own assumptions a look or two before writing this,  keeping what he liked and discarding what didn't nourish him.  Needless to  say, stereotyping, blaming, and attacking an entire belief system does no  one good, least of all the attacker.<br />&quot;When one hunts monsters, one  must be careful not to become a monster oneself--for when you look deeply  into an abyss, the abyss looks deeply into you.&quot;  -- Nietzsche	2000-06-03

He is particularly adept at interpreting women's strength and assertiveness as pathological animus activities, nor does he pause to wonder at the impatience in some of his statements or the disagreeing reactions of some of the women in his audience.<br />This quotation is out of context, of course, but its flavor illustrates what I mean:  &quot;I am afraid,&quot; decides Jung, &quot;women often have a tendency to talk of things as they ought to be or as they desire them to be, or as they should become, but never as they are.&quot;  UGH!!  Still more alarming is how infrequently the audience openly questioned such outrageous remarks by the great man.<br />If you can get past all that and Jung's endless demonstrations of how smart he is, then you'll find treasures and glowing grottoes of psychological insight here and there, such as his brief description of how the Self differentiates out of the collective unconscious.<br />This edition has an informative intro that sums up some of the other issues brought into the seminar and why it was prematurely terminated.	2000-06-01

I still think the message gets in the way of the story.  But how does an author go about reworking what for her was a classic hero-rescues-girl story, especially given what the feminists have shared with us about the patriarchal context, assumptions, and impact of such a tale?<br />LeGuin gave us a splendid original trilogy.  If she wants a bit of vengeance (or whatever it is--one shouldn't psychoanalyze via fictional characters!) on old Ged, or at least to take him down a peg or two, that's certainly understandable.  At the same time, there's a realization in this book that the hero needs to refashion himself once his younger heroic days are over.  Ged accepted the risks of becoming normal and mortal, and now his dilemma is:  how does an aging man, warts and all, find ways to live a meaningful life and find some kind of realistic intimacy with women?	2000-06-01

Read this book  to see why creativity is so central to the human experience.

My one criticism is that the author tends to see in some of  Beethoven's clearly neurotic behavior (e.g., his obsession with his nephew;  his incredible personal messiness; his narcissistic rages at certain  colleagues) an overabundance of some sort of energy--which may indeed be  the case at a very deep level, but hey, misbehavior is misbehavior.  Nevertheless, an excellent Beethoven resource.	2000-05-18

Einstein once said  that he could explain relativity to an uneducated barmaid-- and was famous  for the clarity with which he educated nonscientists.  One could cite many  examples in the philosophical world as well (Camus, William James,  etc.)...writing this bad isn't so for technical reasons, but for stylistic  and egotistic ones.

As with most of his other books, I wish this one had been longer, so much compact wisdom does it contain. Look out for his image of Leviathan as collective &quot;stuff&quot; needing cooking in the fires of consciousness--awesome.<br />At the same time, as you read be aware that as a symbol, Moby Dick cannot be pinned down to anything in particular, even the Self, which is Edinger's interpretation.

I wish it had been a longer book--very enjoyable.<br />There is a remarkable section in which Edinger defends his thesis that the ego's individuative activities leave some sort of permanent deposit in the collective unconscious.  He backs this up with several extremely interesting examples from various literary and religious sources.  For me, this kind of thinking bridges the gap between Hillman's reduction of archetype to image (phenomenologists tend to be impatient with spiritual mysteries beyond word or image) and, the other extreme, the traditional Jungian Kantianism of regarding the archetype as some sort of untouchable realm of Platonic ideals.  The deities NEED us, and it's regrettable that Edinger left us only these tantalizing hints of that.	2000-05-18

Despite Lord Russell's criticism that &quot;intuition works best in bats, bees, and Bergson,&quot; in this work Bergson not only finishes the uprooting of the Western and Platonic disembodied intellect (a  deconstruction taken only so far by Kant), he presents us with the  spectacle of unbridled life creatively shaping, not only its world, but  itself in accord with its own telos:  the need for eyesight creating the  eye, so to speak.

Christian rigidity and stodginess and &quot;the letter of the law must be obeyed&quot; at its finest. An excellent exposition on the logical consequences of deeply distrusting human beings.<br />To be more specific:  Hobbes' key assumption, that humans in a state of nature are uncontrolled brutes, is not only contradicted by all sorts of anthropological evidence; it's a projection that we Westerners like to place over aboriginal peoples in order to justify colonizing them.<br />Read Camus' THE PLAGUE instead, where Tarrou refers to a Hobbesian bureaucrat as &quot;Public Enemy Number One.&quot;	1999-10-14

Should be considered an autobiographical myth (as Jung himself implies) rather than precisely factual.  The first  sentence is one of my favorites:  &quot;My life is a story of the  self-realization of the unconscious.&quot;  -- Craig Chalquist, M.S.,  creator of the Thineownself self-exploration site.	1999-10-14

I recommend this as an intro into the understanding of what Grof and Grof have dubbed &quot;spiritual emergence,&quot; an increasingly common pattern of psychobiological activity often misdiagnosed as psychotic.  -- Craig  Chalquist, M.S., creator of the Thineownself self-exploration site.	1999-10-11

Once again Edinger turns his analyst's eye on a seminal topic--in this case, the apocalypse archetype--and provides useful interpretations and amplifications.  The book's one drawback is the degree to which Edinger's  rather fundamental Jungianism shows through...proving the book's thesis  that it's easy to become possessed by this particular archetype.  Recommended. -- Craig Chalquist, M.S., designer of the &quot;To Thine Own  Self&quot; Web site.	1999-10-04
