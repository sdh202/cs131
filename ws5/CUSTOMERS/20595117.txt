Here it should be remembered that Kimmerling is a scholar of very questionable credentials whose major achievement is ignoring the actual history of the Arab inhabitants of Southern Syria ( As they thought of themselves until Arafat et al. in the early sixties provided them a new name , a national identity, and a way of bamboozling the world. Here Kimmerling tries to prove that Ariel Sharon is involved in destroying that new national Arab identity .<br /><br />However since this book has been published Ariel Sharon withdrew Israeli forces from Gaza, and went before the United Nations to openly support a Palestinian state, even though he firmly believes that historically the Jewish claim to the Holy Land is  a far more legitimate one.<br /><br />Kimmerling ignores totally the eighty -years plus  war the Arabs( Not only the Palestinians ) have waged to drive the Jews from the Middle East. He ignores the fact that the Palestinian Arabs have refused Great Power offers of a state within the Holy Land five - times. He of course ignores too the fact that Ariel Sharon , the villain of this piece, is in favor of the Bush road-map plan calling for a Palestinian Arab state.<br /><br />Kimmerling has devoted his academic life to constructing Palestine for the Arabs, and destroying Israel for the Jews.<br /><br />He will have his own small chapter in the book of Jewish self- hatred ,Torquemada to Chomsky.<br /><br />It is not the worse thing in the world to be pompous, as the writing in this book is. However it is one of the worse for a historian and sociologist to ignore the evidence of history and present reality,and to create a text which is a tissue of myths and lies.	2005-10-09

This thesis has been developed by among others, Dore Gold, in 'Hatred's Kingdom' ,Gerald Posner in \\"Secrets of the Kingdom\\" and John R. Bradley in 'Saudi Arabia Exposed\\".<br /><br />Murawiec a career diplomat has however special insight into the processes of diplomatic corruption especially within the State Department. He cites the present ruler of Saudi Arabia Prince Abdallah's remark that ' taking care of career diplomats when they finish the service' is the best introduction and incentive to new diplomats as to how to act in regard to Saudi Arabia. Murawiec thus points to the tremendous amount of corruption done by Saudi money within the realm of the U.S. government.<br /><br />He is a strong advocate of a new policy toward Saudi in which the US would get tough with the Monarchy. It would insist on end to anti- Western and US propaganda in the schools, an end to the training of ' fighters' many of whom make their way into Iraq to attack American soldiers. It would insist on true reforms within the Saudi regime, and an end to its vast support network for Terror throughout the world.<br /><br />Murawiec believes the Saudis control over the oil market has led to a great increase in the poverty of the poorest nations. While he does not advocate, what might seem , the most logical step for stablizing world oil markets, the takeover of Saudi oil by a US led democratic coalition he does insist that the present situation is one which threatens to lead disaster to the world - economy as a whole.<br /><br />This is a timely wake- up text about a corrupt Middle Eastern regime which unfortunately has been corrupting US diplomacy and foreign policy for decades.	2005-10-09

In this book he presents a clearly argued refutation of this personal charge against him by outlining a peace plan for the Israeli- Palestinian conflict which in his words is both pro- Israeli and pro- Palestinian.<br /><br />Essentially he adopts the two- state position of what in Israel has long been called the ` peace- camp'. It is pretty much the Peres- Beilin plan in which Israel cedes most of the West Bank ( Judaea and Samaria) and Gaza, and in return receives an end to Palestinian terror and violence, and complete international recognition of its legitimacy.<br /><br />In the first part of the book, ` Overcoming the Geopolitical Barriers to Peace' Dershowitz presents the heart of his plan, and answers questions as to possible difficulties with it. The final goal is two states with secure and recognized borders, an end to violence, and end to all claims each side has on the other. In the course of this he indicates that claims which have long been neglected by the world, such as that of Jews expelled from Arab lands must also be taken into account. He indicates that one of the great sticking points, the question of Palestinian Arab refugee return must be solved within the framework of the Palestinian Arab state. He also answers objections to the critics who claim such a state would not be viable. He too criticizes what he calls `extremists' of both sides who would reject all compromise. But he makes it clear that there is a great assymetry here in that the Jewish extremists are on the margin of Israeli society, while Palestinian extremism and rejectionism is the present commanding position within the society.<br /><br />In this regard Dershowitz has no illusion as to what has been the major reason peace has not been made to now. Palestinianian rejectionism of the Peel Commission report in 1937 which would have given them eighty percent of the land West of the Jordan, their rejection of the UN partition plan of 1947 , their rejection of post -1967 peace plan, their rejection most recently in 2000 of the Israeli ( Barak) and US (Clinton) plan which would have given them ninety- seven percent of the West Bank, the control over the Temple Mount, and control over East Jerusalem  has prevented peace from coming earlier. The basic Palestinian Arab rejection of any Jewish sovereignty in the Holy Land is what has made the conflict persist.<br /><br />One source of hope for Dershowitz is the belief that with Arafat's passing a new and more realistic Palestinian leadership will emerge which will opt for the realistic benefit of its people, and not a demagogic vain hope of destroying Israel. Dershowitz seems optimistic that the Palestinians can take a new tack. And while this book was published before the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza he probably believes this an encouraging sign( However one- sided) for peace.<br /><br />In the second section of the book `Overcoming the Hatred Barriers to Peace' Dershowitz briefly but convincingly makes a case for the idea that outside forces which presumably aim to help the Palestinians have caused them tremendous damage. These forces whether the U.N or a certain element of the media and academic world have by demonizing Israel and justifying Palestinian violence encouraged the Palestinians to believe that they need never be responsible and compromise. Deshowitz has his own score with the Evil - Three of Hate- Israel propaganda Chomsky- Cockburn- Finklestein and makes a brief but effective skowering of their being more Palestinian than the Palestinians , in promoting hate of Israel.<br /><br />In this regard one central element Dershowitz claims in any peace - agreement must be the end to the demonization of Israel. And this of course especially by the Palestinian ,Arab and Islamic media for whom it is a major source for distracting their readers from real domestic woes.<br /><br />As for the nuts and bolts of Dershowitz's plan and its realistic possibilities I have my reservations. He does make a very convincing argument that a ` one- state solution' is impossible, a clear cover for the destruction of Israel by demographic means. But my sense is that he does not go fully enough into the dangers of the ` two- state solution.' And my sense is that he is very over- optimistic about a Palestinian transformation towards acceptance of Israel.<br /><br />Yet on the whole I believe his effort is a truly positive and fair one, that aims at providing benefit to both peoples.om real domestic woes.  <br />As for the nuts and bolts of Dershowitz's plan and its realistic possibilities I have my reservations.

We all need a spiritual teacher	This book has helped many people. Its message is that 'Life is difficult' and that we make it more so by running away from our responsibilities and pretending that life cannot be difficult. Peck's prescription for a better life is realizing that life involves a constant effort to understand and improve ourselves. He supplies case- histories of people who seem to have given up or be lost, and then in psychotherapy with him find a way to make better lives. One especially moving story was of a young man who simply could not feel joy at anything in life. He simply had lost his enthusiasm. It turned out that not only had this young man lost a best friend, he had grown up in a world where his two elder brothers knocked down immediately any idea he might have. They tormented him continually and made fun of him. And the parents never paid attention. Peck in two years of psychotherapy was able to teach this young person to stop being fixated at what he was when he was ten years old. He taught the young man how to respect his own thoughts.<br /><br />Peck's message again is of a new psychologyof love, traditional values and spiritual growth.He warns against our tendency to escape from freedom, and to rely on outdated maps of our situation.<br /><br />My sense is that this book has helped so many people in part because so many of us need help. We are continually looking for a message, a word of wisdom or spiritual insight that will help us , and renew our faith in ourselves and life. We are continually looking for a spiritual teacher that will be able to help us.<br /><br />I must admit that this book does not really provide me personally with the kind of message and help I feel a need for at the moment.<br /><br />How I miss my teacher and friend the Holy Teacher Dovid Herzberg who taught by his example a love of people and joy in being with them which lifted up all those who knew him.<br /><br />Scott Peck by this book probably helped thousands maybe even tens of thousands of people.

In time it became one of the inspirational classics of Jewish ethical literature.<br /><br />The emphasis in the work is on ethical behavior, on the virtue of giving as Hashem is a Giver. Its opening chapter Charity brings Wealth illustrates a point I once heard from a Yerushalmi Habad teacher HaRav Rabinovitch who for many years has given Shiurim in the French Hill synagogue.<br /><br />He taught that the true rich person is the one who gives Tsedakah. Why? When a person has money and spends on himself , then the money goes away.

He gathers together midrashim and provides by his ordering and interpreting a midrash of his own.<br /><br />This volume has an introduction on the subject of 'Agnon and Sinai' by the distinguished scholar Judah Goldin, a preface by the translator Michael Swirsky.<br /><br />One Midrash talks about why the Torah is said to have been given on Shavuot and not received on it. And Rabbi Simchah Bunim says this is because the Torah is given on one day and must be received every day.<br /><br />This anthology is of course specially relevant around the time of Shavuot ( as there is the tradition of learning always about the holiday or experience some time before the time as well as during it) but it can be learned from each and every day of the year.	2005-10-02

A second advantage is that it does this by giving a detailed description of the time and world in which Twain lived in. It takes the reader through the wandering Twain's adventures in America , and as an innocent abroad. It relates turning point moments in Twain's life in a dramatic way, as for instance his meeting with William Dean Howells in the Atlantic's office in Boston, a meeting which not only open a forty- one year old friendship but pave the way for Twain's acceptance by the New England Literary culture which dominated American Letters.<br /><br />Powers also gives insight into the unique genius of Twain. There is a wonderful paragraph in which he describes the child's gift for hearing and seeing in unusual ways. And how this gift would totally transform American literature bringing into the colloquial voices of so many different American worlds.<br /><br />There have been other very good biographies of Mark Twain but this one in its most detailed reading of the life is a real contribution to our understanding of America's greatest comic writer.	2005-10-01

This singularity will mean our transformation in a way beyond that which we can conceive now. It will be the beginning of a new Age of Evolution of Mind on the planet, and in the Universe. Mankind will merge with Technology, and what comes out of it will be Intelligence beyond anything we can possibly know now.<br /><br />Kurzweil in an interview with Edge's John Brockman described the process as follows:<br /><br />\\" Within 30 years we'll be able to create non-biological intelligence that's comparable to human intelligence. Just like a biological system, we'll have to provide it an education, but here we can bring to bear some of the advantages of machine intelligence: Machines are much faster, and much more accurate. A thousand-dollar computer can remember billions of things accurately - we're hard-pressed to remember a handful of phone numbers.<br /><br />Once they learn something, machines can also share their knowledge with other machines...<br /><br /> So we can educate machines through a process that can be hundreds or thousands of times faster than the comparable process in humans. It can provide a 20-year education to a human-level machine in maybe a few weeks or a few days and then these machines can share their knowledge.<br /><br />The primary implication of all this will be to enhance our own human intelligence. ...<br /><br />Most importantly, we'll be able to enhance our biological intelligence with non-biological intelligence through intimate connections. ...<br /><br />If you follow these trends further, you get to a point where change is happening so rapidly that there appears to be a rupture in the fabric of human history. Some people have referred to this as the \\"Singularity.\\" There are many different definitions of the Singularity, a term borrowed from physics, which means an actual point of infinite density and energy that's kind of a rupture in the fabric of space-time.<br /><br />Here, that concept is applied by analogy to human history, where we see a point where this rate of technological progress will be so rapid that it appears to be a rupture in the fabric of human history. It's impossible in physics to see beyond a Singularity, which creates an event boundary, and some people have hypothesized that it will be impossible to characterize human life after the Singularity. My question is, what will human life be like after the Singularity, which I predict will occur somewhere right before the middle of the 21st century?\\"<br /><br />As I do not come from the world of Artificial Intelligence or Technology, or even of Science my response to all this may simply seem to those who knows those worlds naïve and irrelevant.<br /><br />Nonetheless I will ask the questions which seem to me at the very least point to a certain problematic quality in Kurzweil's prediction.<br /><br />First of all , it seems to me human life and experience have far more in them than `Intelligence' and ` Knowledge'. Abstracting one quality of human life out from the total flow of life, and giving that absolute value seems to me to misread and ignore much of what human beings consider most valuable in human life. Where is real love and intimacy in the utopian future Kurzweil is describing for us? Where is the importance of the life- story of the person, in striving cradle to grave to make a meaningful contribution to the world?  Where are whole aspects of experience, the poetic, the religious? And where too is so much of what is unique and precious in life which is connected to our specific physiognomy, our bodily being?  Are these minds of the future going to walk across Boston Common as Emerson did one day, ` glad to the brink of fear? `<br /><br />Now I know Kurzweil argues that in the machine- human merge there will open up virtual realities which will provide a variety and richness beyond anything we know now? But what I wonder of the singularity of human experience and the special relation to all I know , because it is mine? Are there going to be ` individuals' in this world of minds downloading minds? and if there are what parents and family will they have ? Or are parents and family irrelevant to the overall Evolutionary development of Intelligence?<br /><br />What I am trying to say is that I do not know, cannot possibly give a technological evaluation of the state of nanotechnology, or even of stem cell technology. I cannot really cancel out the feasibility of some of Kurzweil's predictions for us. But I can question whether the outcome which he so values , this vast development of INTELLIGENCE is truly desirable.<br /><br />And here I come to a point made by a number of other Amazon reviews, and that is that Kurzweil downplays the dangers of such technologies. Here I think he might do well to take a look at the human condition as we now see it on the planet. The twenty percent living on less than one dollar a day , the other twenty percent living on less than two dollars a day, the situation of vast inequality which the new technologies are likely to reenforce. The long human history of war, and the present situation in which totalitarian terror threats Mankind as a whole , too raise the question of whether some of the new dominating- technologies might come into the control of forces which are not exactly tolerant and democratic. The rising star of China has put the lights out all over Tibet, and might do so for a good share of humanity should it control these technologies.<br /><br />Here it is possible to multiple dystopic scenarios to counter Kurzweil's essentially optimistic one. I do not know how this will work out in the future, but anyone who has studied the history of Mankind a bit, and even the history of intellectual elites knows that Intelligence is no guarantee of Morality, and may in fact be used in the service of great Evil.<br /><br />One final point which may trivial to those who have a grand vision in the world. It seems to me that for most human beings what is most valuable is the few human beings we most truly love. Replacing them with virtual models of what they are, or somehow trivializing them by making for them artificial substitutes ( However improved in durability and computing power) is not I think what most of us want.<br /><br />It is the singularity of those human beings we love, and of life itself which seems to me most valuable.ce and the special relation to all I know , because it is mine?

Both claim that this book is not only tremendously funny but a very deep probe into the nature of Yiddish, and in fact Diaspora Ashkenazi experience.<br /><br />This is what Lambert has to say about the lead idea of the book.<br /><br />\\"Yiddish, Wex argues, is most comfortable when it's complaining. It's \\"a language that likes to argue with everybody about everything.\\" He explains this as consistent with the Mishnaic scholars (who \\"disagree 99.8 percent of the time\\") and the principle of \\"aftselakhis\\"-\\"the impulse to do things only because someone else doesn't want you to.\\" The kvetch, or complaint, is thus the basic unit of Yiddish thought, as developed over hundreds of years of Diaspora living: \\"kvetching becomes a way of exercising some small measure of control over an otherwise hostile environment.\\"<br /><br />It is rare when we find a book which not only enriches our thought but makes us laugh outloud.	2005-09-29

Kurt Messick. Messick's reviews are among the best I know. They are usually careful and often profound readings of the texts in question.<br /><br />He points out that Hubert G. Locke's title is somewhat misleading as the focus is not on Racism, nor the Holocaust but rather on issues of religious faith and doubt occasioned by Locke's loss of his parents.<br /><br />I found this work to be a sincere and moving one. Locke writes beautifully about his mother and her religious faith and what this meant to him. The doubts raised in him by her loss are I am sure familiar to everyone who has lost a loved one. In the Jewish tradition a person who has lost a close relative is freed of religious duties before the time of the burial. It is understood somehow that this is a time of tremendous questioning and turmoil.<br /><br />Locke sets out the story of his own intellectual journey. He seems to an especially sensitive and understanding person. When he speaks about the way he conducted so many funerals without understanding really what the people must be going through(Something he could only understand when suffering his own loss) he shows his modesty and awareness of human failing.<br /><br />No one I believe can answer the questions raised by the seemingly disproportionate suffering of good people, the questions of the reality of the Afterlife in a clear and decisive way. The great teacher Maimonedes taught us that it does not make much sense to speculate on such questions.<br /><br />In the end as Locke understands we are left with our need for God and the faith which may not abolish doubt but contends with it and at vital moments overcomes it.<br /><br />This is a profound book by a very noble and admirable human being.	2005-09-29

In this work he is obsessed with the turning point event which is the use of nuclear weapons. As he understands it Mankind lived throughout its history with threats to individual life, but nuclear weapons have brought a new kind of collective threat, a threat that Mankind will completely destroy itself.<br /><br />Koestler's concern here connects with his perception of Mankind as a kind of defective product of Evolution. He especially focuses on the conflict between our reptilian brain , our lower mammal brain and the brain of reason our neocortex. He too sees the human propensity for violent conflict as something which relates to our being controlled by the emotional lower brain. But he too singles out our propensity for 'loyalty' for collective bonding as source of violence. And his claim is that the kind of individual criminal act people often focus on when talking about the defects of Mankind, is secondary to the evils we do out of loyalty to the Collective.<br /><br />Koestler in analyzing the human situation also makes an effort to supply an overall theory of the organization of reality. He speaks of a heirarchal principle in which things are organized in all realms in two directions. The Janus- like character of reality is that each thing is organized as independent and autonomous on one level, and as a part of a higher whole on another. This dual aspect character in which the ' wholes' or as he calls them 'holons ' are greater than the parts he seems as integrating all realms of experience.<br /><br />Koestler writes a chapter on Humor and on the Act of Creation. He sees humor as operating by what he calls 'biassociation' which involves bringing two different frameworks into connection. He provides many examples. But I do not feel myself capable of adequately assessing his theories here , though I do have a basic feeling that ' comprehensive and all - inclusive explanations' cannot really cover the various kinds of creative activity there are.<br /><br />This is an ambitious, challenging work. I must admit his pessimistic evaluation of human character and nature set me back a bit. The horrifying possibility that Disaster is the Ultimate end of us all does not warm the heart.<br /><br />Again I do not feel I can properly evaluate Koestler's theories but I do appreciate his capacity to arouse interest and curiosity.<br /><br />A truly outstanding work.sive explanations' cannot really cover the various kinds of creative activity there are.  <br />This is an ambitious, challenging work.

Nuland is not only a physician and writer, he is a compassionate human being and an educator. He aims in this work to teach us how to prepare for the inevitable, how to better understand how to deal with death when it comes.<br /><br />As he understands it there is a tendency to romanticize the final moments, to imagine the end of the drama is a kind of bedside scene in which family and friends gather to say farewell to one who peacefully slips off. Nuland would disabuse us of that notion and teach that Death is ordinarily more messy prolonged and complicated than we would like. And that it often comes only through the deprivation of the dignity of the suffering patient.<br /><br />He emphasizes that our human goal should be not to focus overmuch on the death of the person, but rather on their life and its remembrance.<br /><br />He examines the major causes of death, Old Age, Cancer, Heart Disease, Trauma, Aids, Alzheimers. He gives us moving case - histories one of his own grandmother's passing from the world, the other of a young child suddenly killed. He underlines the point that no matter how healthy the person thinks they are they can never know when and how Death will come. No one has a guarantee of an easy way out.<br /><br />He does not really touch upon any religious or spiritual consolation. And though he indicates that he did say the Jewish prayer of mourning Kaddish for his mother he gives no indication that he believes in an afterlife.  \\"If there is a God,\\" he says, \\"He is present as much in the creation of each of us as He was at the creation of the earth\\".<br /><br />He again would have us focus on life. And so he warns against those who would struggle at any and all costs to artificially extend life through heroic measures i.e. he urges an acceptance of Death as inevitable and necessary. He on the other side  he is in general against giving patients' the right to take their<br /><br />own lives.<br /><br />This work may tell some more than they ever want to know about death, and may help others better prepare for it.<br /><br />The late William Saroyan on his deathbed was seen shaking his head.

Agnon was not simply a great writer but one steeped in Jewish literature and tradition. And with a deep and abiding love of the Jewish people and the land of Israel.<br /><br />The book which Dafna Agnon- Golan has produced is a one- sided anti- Israeli document. It makes no effort whatsoever to examine the Palestinians and other Arabs role in initiating and perpetuating the conflict as a violent one. The author does not seem to recognize 'Israeli self- defense' as a legitimate purpose. In face in the concluding passages of the book she celebrates the fact that her child will not be going to the Israeli Army. So when there is need to respond somehow to Arab terror and violence the Agnon- Golans will not be a part of this. They will be at peace with themselves.<br /><br />Sympathy with the 'other'is the heart of human morality. There is nothing wrong with Dafna- Golan's caring for the Palestinians, being concerned about their suffering, trying to help them. But when this is done by distorting the truth completely, disguising the true actions and motivations of Palestinian society as a whole, - when it is done by showing no sympathy for the victims of the atrocities the Palestinians have committed against the Jews - when it is done with no real balance , and fairness- it stands truth and morality on its head.<br /><br />Agnon is better off that he did not live to see such dishonorable use put to his great name.	2005-09-26

It advocates greater cooperation between the European Union and the United States in promoting and extending democratic freedoms throughout the world.<br /><br />It points to the trend in the world towards extension of democratic freedoms and believes the West should have the mission of fighting poverty throughout the globe and extending democratic freedoms insofar as this is possible.<br /><br />All this is wise and good, but the author tends to downplay the negative forces working to undermine the West. He repeatedly faults Europe for not integrating its Muslim population without considering the possibility that that population is resisting the idea of integration, and in fact promoting an eventually Islamic Europe. Here Garton Ash would have done well to have read Bat- Yeor's work, \\"Eurabia\\". He does not consider in depth the dangers to the world economy presented by OPEC, and the oil monopoly.  He does not look at the terrible repression of women which is so widespread throughout the Islamic world.<br /><br />And so while his values and ideal aims are commendable he does not give a detailed enough presentation of the obstacles in the way of their realization.	2005-09-25

This book is a shameful blood- libel.<br /><br />The 'Holocaust' was the Nazi effort to destroy every man , woman and child of the Jewish people. Approximately six- million Jews over one third of the Jewish people were murdered by the Nazis.<br /><br />The Palestinian Arabs have been engaged for over eighty years in a struggle over control of the Holy Land with the Israeli Jews. In that time the Palestinian Arabs have refused five major efforts for Peace, including those brokered by the British, by the United Nations and by and the United States.<br /><br />In the wars which have been fought over the land and in which neighboring Arab armies joined the Palestinians in fighting against the Jews of Israel twenty- thousand Israelis lost their lives, and more than fifty- thousand Arabs were killed.But this was in war , and not in indiscriminate attacks on civilians.<br /><br />There was never a communal effort or national policy on the part of the Jews to destroy the Palestinian people as a whole- and certainly no policy to kill indiscriminately. In fact the opposite has been the case and Palestinian terror has taken many innocent lives. The tactic of suicide- bombing is the most recent tactic of terror efforts which have gone on for years.<br /><br />This book is one big lie throughout.	2005-09-23

I happened to be around then, and along with my sister who bought me the book eagerly rushed to read it then. I have read it more than one time since, and will write a few words about it without in any way attempting to be comprehensive or definitive. A very subjective few words.<br /><br />Salinger in this work is building the Glass family myth. This would be his central fiction for the major part of his publishing career post \\"The Catcher and the Rye\\" Along with the 'Franny and Zooey\\" there is the earlier \\"Nine Stories\\" which contains the first story about  Seymour Glass, \\" A Perfect Day for Bananfish' something about Waker and Walt Glass, \\" Uncle Wiggly in Connecticut\\" and a story about Boo- Boo Glass Tannebaum,\\"Down at the Dinghy\\"  Two more long stories published as one volume, \\" Seymour an Introduction\\" and \\"Raise High the Roof Beams Carpenter\\" were also published as one volume. And then there is the final story Salinger published before going silent, the long New Yorker tale( Hepworth) savaged by the Salinger critics. In this one the colloquial speech which is so much of Salinger's special appeal became overly- mannered kind of solipsistic discourse.<br /><br />All this is a long prelude to a few words about 'Franny and Zooey' The stories ostensibly have to do with the crises of two of the younger Glass family members. Franny's crisis relates to her relationship with the ' section- man Lane Coutrell' whose academic pretentious values mark him out as part of the kind of ' phony  world' Salinger is always condemning. The actor Buddy too has his crisis relating to the mundane world of acting. The epiphany and final sentimental ending of the story which has to do with ' doing it for the Fat Lady' is Salinger's way of saying that despite all the sordid realities of realities there is no escaping if one wishes to be truly holy, from contending with everyday life and ordinary people.<br /><br />In the context and in the background is of course Salinger's creation of this family of geniuses, of oddball mystics, Jewish- Irish in origin who have a real flair and feeling for everyday American culture. The father Les has been an old vaudeville man and the mother Bessie softshoed with him on the old Pantages circuit.<br /><br />Along with creating the ring- ding authentic poet genius Seymour and the storywriter Buddy who is his ' amaneusis' Salinger gives us a picture of a lovable family who must deal with the everyday world, but somehow cannot. The great symbol of this is of course the family superstar, guru, oldest son, Seymour who commits suicide in 'A Perfect Day for Bananafish' a suicide not unconnected with the seemingly bourgeois, petty character of his wife and mother- in- law.<br /><br />'Franny and Zooey' has great Salinger dialogue and is wonderful in the whole feeling it gives of the Upper West Side special Glass- Salinger world. 'Manhatanee' and 'Salingerese' speak here at their best. But it also has that pretensiousness, that religious condescension, that simplicity of message( Go East young Westerners and be in touch with your true higher soul) which is at the heart of much of Salinger's work.<br /><br />In other words fifty years later aside from the Literature and the delight of the language and a world gone, all of which can be loved, there is a kind of criticism. I believe Salinger spiritually got it somehow wrong, and that this too relates to his continuing silence as a writer.<br /><br />But this does not detract from the special world he created and the pleasure of reading he has given to so many.nd in the background is of course Salinger's creation of this family of geniuses, of oddball mystics, Jewish- Irish in origin who have a real flair and feeling for everyday American culture.

He points to the fact that people are living longer than they ever have, that the baby-boomer generation is moving into its senior years, that this new generation of elderly people has a power and wealth that no other such generation has had, that with the birth- death there is a dramatically shifting proportion of the elderly in the general population, that this major demographic change is going to effect all aspects of our lives, including family and work. And that it is necessary to take action to prepare for the changes, and make better lives possible.<br /><br />Dychtwald is an interesting writer, and he certainly is on to a major social trend. I myself however believe he is a bit optimistic about the whole thing. I think our world will be much sadder if it has very few children in it. I think it will be much sadder if it has predominantly elderly people in it, however successful they all are at looking 'younger' than their biological years.<br /><br />I believe Mankind will make a major mistake if it allows the Elderly to overwhelm the younger generations.<br /><br />I also have quite a bit of skepticism in regarding to the whole ' cyclic ' life business. I suspect some of us do not want to have 'three or four families' but rather that the one we have is enough. I suspect too it is very optimistic to talk about going back and learning, and making new careers. How many eighty years old are going to do Mathematics?<br /><br />Youth has powers which are unique and tragically passing. They cannot be replaced simply by adding years on our lives.<br /><br />I will conclude with one small anecdote relating to my own grandmother, my Bubbe Zeibert of blessed memory. She was a very kind and wise women. When she became so ill that she could no longer be cared for at home my mother reluctantly had to have her admitted to an Old Age home . Once when we were visiting my mother asked her how the place is. She answered,\\" Good, good. But only one problem. There are so many old people here\\"<br /><br />I am afraid if the vision outlined here comes true many of us are going to feel the same way..

He was ninety- six years old. Thousands of words have been written about him and his life- task. Certainly one of the major contributions he made was to make people aware of the enormity of the crime which was the Holocaust. After the war many wished to forget, but he out of a strong sense of duty to those who had died, to those who had been murdered and suffered so much , made it his business to make the world remember. And he too made his business to bring to justice those who committed the crime. And as he said many times he did this not only for the victims, but for the future generations of mankind so that such an evil would never come again not only to Jews but to all of humanity.<br /><br />He personally made a major contribution to bringing to justice more than one thousand war criminals, including Eichmann,Stangl , and the Nazi who took Anne Frank from her home and sent her to her death.<br /><br />In this work he ponders the question of forgiveness . He is asked by a Nazi who repents of his crimes for forgiveness. And the question the book asks is whether such forgiveness should be given. It seems to me the answer to this question is given by something which Wiesenthal himself wrote. He wrote that while it might be possible to forgive someone for an injury done to oneself, one has no right to forgive for others. It is those who have been murdered who need to be requested forgiveness of. But one and one half - million Jewish children were not given the chance to answer. I think that no one has the right to answer in their name.<br /><br />Wiesenthal was after the war urged by his wife to take up his profession as architect . He could not . He dedicated himself to the memory of the victims, and to having justice done. He explained this as follows. He said that when the day would come and he would die he would go upstairs. And there he would meet those who had not survived the Shoah. They would crowd around him , and say, \\" You were lucky, you had life all those years. What did you do with them\\" And Wiesenthal said, \\" I would say to them. I did not forget you.\\"<br /><br />May the memory of this great Jew and human being be a blessing for all of us.im , and say, \\" You were lucky, you had life all those years.

Here it should be noted that Van Creveld is the person who upon the US invasion of Iraq predicted that the Israeli Army in a coordinated move would expel all Palestinians from the West Bank. Of course this loudly made prediction as many of Van Creveld's claims in this book proved to be nothing but the empty product of his very disturbed imagination.<br /><br />Consider his description of the situation of the Israeli Army vis- a- vis the Palestinians now. He considers a bloated Israeli force to be incapable of real action, and possibly subject to collapse. However in the past few years Israeli intelligence has been superb,and its forces succeeded in halting the Palestinian suicide - campaign. The Palestinian leaders especially of Hamas and Islamic Jihad were all in hiding.<br /><br />Here it should be noted that most military experts, including Jane's believes that Israel should it wish can completely overwhelm any Palestinian military threat in a few days. And in fact after the Palestinian suicide- terror campaign climaxing with the Pesach Seder in Netanya murders, the IDF took all the West Bank back in twenty four hours.<br /><br /> Aside from the erroneous military assessments of Israel's present strength Van Creveld repeatedly undermines his own credibility by gratuitously insulting Israeli leaders and military figures. This may relate to some psychological problem he has , but his editors should have been more careful to diminish this kind of insult.<br /><br />Van Creveld also attacks the Israeli nuclear doctrine of 'opacity' while at the same time underestimating the nuclear threat presented by the Islamic world, especially Iran.<br /><br />He too has a sentimental, uncritical look at Palestinian violence which he diminishes the ' monstrous ' and ' inhumane ' character of.<br /><br />In general Van Creveld does not give a fair overall picture of the IDF as it has evolved through the years. Israel, according to Jane's and others, has evolved in its military capacity to the point that the qualitative gap between it and all Arab forces is far greater than ever before. Its command- and- control systems have no match in the Arab world.<br /><br />While it does face terror- threats today from Hizbollah in the North to the Palestinians in Gaza and Judaea and Samaria, and a potential non- conventional threat from Iran, and perhaps elsewhere. it is nonetheless considered to have a far superior military force than all its enemies combined.<br /><br />Its weakness is in the political realm, about which there is much to say , but not in this review.<br /><br />As for Van Creveld's work it does not do justice to the  subject it surveys.erall picture of the IDF as it has evolved through the years.

This is a ridiculous claim which aims at concealing a fundamental truth, that there is a kind of criticism of Israel which whether justified or not is not at all anti- Semitic, and another kind of criticism of Israel which is definitely anti- Semitic. And this kind of criticism of Israel is the kind which wishes to do harm and bring destruction to the Jewish state.<br /><br />In fact Chomsky Cockburn Finklestein are along with the late Sheik Yassin the present members of Hamas Al Quaeda, Mr.Saddam Hussein, the present regime of mullahs in Iran, working with all their strength to destroy the Jewish state.<br /><br />Finklestein is an anti- Semite because he hates and wants to destroy Israel<br /><br />He is an Anti- Semite because he for years has insulted survivors of the Holocaust even making a strange definition whereby he denies most of them the status of ' survivor'<br /><br />This is not a matter of playing semantic games.<br /><br />The Finklestein who supports the Palestinian causes has not one negative word for suicide- bombers, not one negative word for a Palestinian society that has repeatedly refused offers of peace by Israel.<br /><br />As for Finklestein's attack on Dershowitz's ' A Case for Israel' The fact is Dershowitz is a courageous person who has dared to call ' terrorists' ' terrorists'. Though I believe his political position in which he advocates Israel 's surrendering most of the West Bank ( Judaea and Samaria) to the Palestinians is mistaken this comes clearly out of his desire to achieve compromise and peace. It does not come as it does with Finklestein out of denial of the Jews historical connection to the land of Israel.<br /><br />I would make one point. Finklestein, Chomsky Cockburn et al are in the camp of the totalitarian terrorists. They tacitly or not have more sympathy for the opponents of the US and the West, than they do for the United States, and its ally Israel.<br /><br />They are not simply traitors to the Jewish people but traitors to the United States, the West , and all that is decent to mankind.<br /><br />The University of California Press should be ashamed that it published this mendacious and invidious work.terrorists.

It seeks to identify the major social trend of the human future, and indicate ways it can be shaped for the benefit of us all.<br /><br />The dramatic rise in the average length of life which took place in the twentieth century is according to Ken Dychtwald going to continue in the future. The great cohort of the Baby Boomers, seventy- six million strong is moving into 'Old Age' and they will bring with them new demands and even a new definition of the condition of 'Old Age'.<br /><br />As the author sees it we are moving toward a 'gerontocracy' where the older segments of the population will have more and more power, not only in the market- place, but in determining the values and priorities of society as a whole.<br /><br />For Dychtwald the fact that more and more people will live longer and longer lives, and will be an increasingly large proportion of the population raises challenges for Humanity as a whole of a kind we have not faced before.<br /><br />Will Old Age become as it is for so many now a story of chronic illness, increasing disability? Or will the new technologies and medicines that are emerging enable for most a transformation where not only the age of old age will be pushed backward, but where a new ' cyclic' kind of life- style will begin with people starting new careers, new lives, new worlds of interest in old age?<br /><br />The questions are many and Dychtwald provides a text which is tremendously rich in information and suggestions.<br /><br />He points to the fact that the United States is not now really preparing itself for this dramatic demographic change. And he indicates that nonetheless many prescient and active individuals are moving toward extending their lives in a healthier and better way.<br /><br />There are many questions raised by the books arguments that I cannot begin to address in this review. One is the question of what happens to the human spirit , the human power of innovation, the whole feeling of hope in life when there is in effect a world of older generations only, with so little youth in it?<br /><br />Other questions I have relate to the overall purpose and meaning of lives seemingly dedicated to their endless extension and pleasure.

Thoreau defined it as the person who can't walk in step with the others because he 'hears the sound of his own drummer'.<br /><br />Brautigan put a number of things together. A kind of clearness in telling about what he was seeing right before him. A kind of whimsical random associativeness which broke up the prose line, and often make it feel as if what was on the page had nothing to do with what had come before it or after it. And most savingly, a kind of humor , this very much connected with the going his own way, and displacing things and putting them in strange order. Surprise.  He also had a closeness to America, whether he liked it or not.<br /><br />I agree with many of the readers about his big problem being that he often seemed to not really know or care what he was talking about. Writing was his business, and whatever came to him that's what made it on the page. So it seems.<br /><br />But he had a kind of lightness with it all, and he could really sometimes make the reader laugh, which in my opinion, is saying a lot.<br /><br />I do not know what he really believed, unfortunately.<br /><br />Reading him is like taking a ride in an amusement park. You enjoy it but you are not exactly sure you know why. And in the end it is not something that is going to stay with you in the strongest way.<br /><br />Enjoy the reading while you are reading it- and don't expect too much more.	2005-09-20

All his books have his own strange combination of truth- telling , fantasy, crazy fact,jibe, reflection, and original insight.<br /><br />In this one written when he is eighty- two he does a hatchet - job on the Bush Administration, the consuming -carelessly gas- guzzling American, and humanity in general. The title of the work is explained by Vonnegut,\\"\\"I am a man without a country, except for the librarians and a Chicago paper called In These Times.\\"<br /><br />He criticizes humanity for being chimpanzees in love with their own power. But as always with Vonnegut there is some lurking hint of redemption and cockeyed affection in the pages. In these essays one center of that is his essay on extended families which he favors. He is dismayed at the thought that most people today are so self- centered that they give little time to planning and acting for generations ahead.<br /><br />With Vonnegut the diatribe can be tiresome but it is most often redeemed with some flash of crack- up humor.In explaining why he wrote the book at his advanced age when his own father retired at fifty- five,he says \\" I've lived a long time . I didn't plan to live so long. It was a graceless thing to do. But what am I going to do with myself. This is what I do.\\"<br /><br />In reflecting upon humanity , he says \\" Only a nut case would want to be a human being, if he or she had the choice\\"<br /><br />This kind of stuff may be tiresome, but I don't think Vonnegut should be taken so literally. The humor tells us that despite all the condemnations he has a bit of hope at least for some of us.<br /><br />Vonnegut's writings have given a lot of people pleasure through the years. That he is disenchanted with most of us does not mean that we should be disenchanted with him.<br /><br />I think instead we should take the best of what he has to give, and consider seriously his criticisms of us, even if a good share are judged by us to be unfair.<br /><br />The planet is helped a bit by having this kind of old codger and his writings around.<br /><br />You may not like us so much Mr.Vonnegut, but some of us sure do like you.of us, even if a good share are judged by us to be unfair.  <br />The planet is helped a bit by having this kind of old codger and his writings around. <br />You may not like us so much Mr.Vonnegut, but some of us sure do like you.  <br />	2005-09-20

How did one who for years had fought against Palestinian terror and knew the leaders of that terror well, suddenly come to believe that the terrorists would totally change their character and intention? How did Peres who lived all his adult life in the Middle East come to believe that the peoples of the Middle East, rooted in religious and social economic customs of centuries,would overnight change their character and become Northern Europeans?<br /><br />The answers to this may have to do with the ambitious Peres understanding of just how tired the Israeli public is of war, and how much they long for peace?<br /><br />The fact is however that the vision Peres set out in this book has twelve years later proven a fantasy and an illusion. The Arabs are still by and large mired in backwardness( Even their oil boon does not stop them but only leads them to more and more purchases of weapons). The campaign of terror including suicide- terror they launched in the wake of the failure of Oslo has taken by this time over a thousand Israeli lives.<br /><br />The 'new Middle East' looks very much like the Old Middle East, only even worse in terms of fanaticism and Israel- hatred.<br /><br />Peres should have retired long ago. But he is unbelievably still in the Israeli cabinet today, about to be again chosen leader of Israel's second major party, and even more eager than before to trust those Palestinians now accumulating more weapons in Gaza than they have ever had before.	2005-09-19

And I remember how his tales did not provide the kind of pleasure and insight I had found in other literature. \\"The Gold Bug\\" confounded me , and \\"The Tell- Tale Heart\\" frightened me, and the truth is even in adult years I have never taken much delight in the reading of the fictions of Poe.<br /><br />The horror of real life has always seemed to me more than enough, and I have never particularly enjoyed the mood and tone of Poe's fictions.<br /><br />I must admit too that Poe always seemed to me even when reading him as a child , 'extremely weird' to use a children's word. And ' weird' not simply with the connotation of ' strange' but of 'frighteningly so'.<br /><br />In any case there is a Poe that I have treasured. It might not be in the whole of the poem, but in the rhythmn of 'Nevermore' there did strike a kind of fascinating note. And there are in the poetry of Poe great lines, 'the beauty that was Greece, the glory that was Rome'. And a sadness and a feeling of tragedy in some of the love- poetry.<br /><br />Poe is of course much else to most other readers than to me, and the lovers of mystery stories, and detectives, of fictional conundrums tending toward horror, and of strange obsessions with beauty that dies young, will find more than they ask for in this anthology.	2005-09-19

But the editors of this anthology take an earlier point of origin and begin with the great myth - master and singer of songs of innocence and experience, William Blake. They include in their anthology  not simply English Romantic poets but also the Americans , Emerson and Thoreau( Transcendentalists) and Poe. They also include a number of minor, lesser known poets.<br /><br />But what is most important is that they have most of the great definining poems of English Romantic Poetry, the great poems of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats.<br /><br />There are of course as many definitions of Romanticism as there are of other key intellectual-historical concepts such as 'Nature' and 'Classicism' But one clear element is a new found emphasis on self, and subjectivity , the expression of the individual's feeling of the world. Wordsworth went to everyday life and language, to nature and the world of the ' simple people' he met in his countryside wanderings. Coleridge went to the world of myth and mystery, but they both provided in deeper ways whole worlds of feeling which were at times ' deeper than tears'.<br /><br />An outstanding anthology of one of the most important 'movements' or ' periods' in the world- history of poetry.	2005-09-19

They are without basic health and educational services. Twenty- thousand of these people die each day.<br /><br />His work here is an effort to transform the situation of these people, and provide them with the opportunity for a more decent life. In order to do this he believes that there must be an investment on the part of Western and prosperous nations  amounting to less than half - of - one percent of their annual GNP. He believes this capitol if used wisely can be a vital element in moving the poorer societies from situations of stagnation to one of modest growth and trade.<br /><br />Sachs has traveled the world and is an expert on the particular economic situation of hundreds of different locales. He sees the importance of geography in the whole equation of development. For instance he claims that one reason the Indian subcontinent was able to make progress in a way sub- Saharan Africa could not was because of its vast watered areas.<br /><br />He also sees the tremendous need for a transformation in health and sanitation services , if there is to be a major move out of poverty.<br /><br />I  myself have little knowledge of the worlds he talks about, and no professional economic qualification which would enable me to judge with any confidence the feasibility of his ideas.<br /><br />What I can say is that his vision and effort are in my eyes tremendously admirable and courageous. They are the vision of one who cares, who is willing to tackle a seemingly implacable human problem and find an innovative answer to it.<br /><br />My prayer is that he will know a real success, and that one ancient dream will come true and the great mass of mankind will live in conditions which enable them to pursue lives of dignity.	2005-09-19

'Candide' is perhaps the only work which still appeals to anyone outside the realm of scholarship.<br /><br />Voltaire was the great fighter against superstition , irrationality, cruelty and oppression. Yet he himself was often superstitious, irrational, cruel and oppressive. A person of pique and of pose, and a very good hater .He certainly does not present an example of a lovable and kind human being, a good person.<br /><br />His vast intellect was devoted to learning many different kinds of things most of which are outside the canon of our knowledge today. He did not really after all have a scientific education and worldview, and was much closer to being a Continental theorist than a good common - sense empiricist.<br /><br />His spite and his hatred in regard to Christianity, took a specially malicious turn in relation to the Jews. Instead of sympathizing with arguably the most oppressed group in Christendom he oppressed them further.<br /><br />He is a thin man, with a razor - sharp pen, and  a very cutting way of describing his fellow human- beings.<br /><br />If all of mankind were created to be objects of satire, then he would be the great understander of humanity.<br /><br />His writing leaves a bad taste in the soul, because even when he is trying to right an injustice in it, one feels that there is no real love of people or of humanity in it.	2005-09-18

She comes up with a list of characteristics which describe their behavior. The first and primary one is social dis-ease. By this she means 'all our chronic inhibitions and handicaps.\\" It is discomfort and awkwardness in the whole realm of social interaction. \\"Embarassment, insularity, awkwardness, perverse obliqueness, emotional constipation, fear of intimacy and general inability to engage in a normal and straightforward fashion with other human beings.\\"<br /><br />She sees the famous English ' reserve' and its opposite 'English hooliganism' as signs of the same basic disorder.<br /><br />To this dis- ease she says the English reflexively respond. The first response is with Humor. English understated and ironic often self- deprecatory humor is the great reflexive action to awkwardness. The English play it and themselves down.<br /><br />Another reflexive action is ' moderation' or ' the avoidance of extremes of any kind'.\\" Our moderate industriousness and moderate hedonism\\" and \\"our ambivelence,apathy, woolliness, middlingness, fenc- sitting etc.\\"She says the English do everything in moderation except being moderate.<br /><br />A third reflex is 'hypocrisy'But she sees this not as a negative but as expression of the English desire to be fair, and not insulting. And she shows how English speech is filled with phrases 'sorrys ' of various kinds which aim at not intruding and hurting.<br /><br />Other basic English characteristics are what she calls ' empiricism' that is a preference for the concrete, the sensually realistic , rather than for wooly theorizing. And along with this there is the English 'eeyorness' by which she means ineffectual complaining, 'moaning' non- stop in a not - very serious way. This relates too to a typical English pessimism, or skepticism. She also speaks about how strongly class- conscious the English are in their speech and manner. And how for them the values of fair play, courtesy and modesty are central.<br /><br />I must admit that her analysis taught me quite a bit about the English. I recently had to spend a month in England in not very pleasant circumstances in a hospital. I found the great share of the people there extremely polite and considerate. I was however a bit puzzled by their capacity at preserving a distance, and their clear avoidance of any kinds of strong emotional expression. For instance I wanted to thank one nurse who had been especially kind to my wife and myself. But I saw that any 'emotional thanks' was out of place, and that she took the manner in a much lighter way.<br /><br />Again I learned by this book , but it is not seem to me the whole story.<br /><br />One of the things which most strikes me about the English does not necessarily have to do with their way of acting in everyday life situations now. Shakespeare is English and so is Wordsworth, and so is Newton and Faraday and Darwin. And the list of very great English is very long indeed. And in my own field of Literature certainly the English have created one of the great literatures of mankind.<br /><br />So my question is not simply how the English manage in everyday life, and how their character is expressed there. As I see it the English are of Mankind 's ' great peoples' ' great creator peoples'.<br /><br />Now in England I had the feeling that the society as a whole has a very high level of competence, and technical skill. That's one thing, and England's tremendous place in the Scientific and Technological Revolutions of the past five centuries is clear. But how does this relate to the soul of a Wordsworth or a Milton or so many others, the English genius.<br /><br />But perhaps I am unfairly asking that the author have written a book different from the excellent and informative one that she did write.st admit that her analysis taught me quite a bit about the English.

And I am aware too of the historical role, sunny Italy played for those lost in the cold north who dreamed of  new life Goethelike in the land of the south. I too know that one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world is the community of Rome which as I recently saw is sadly depleted and has not recovered from the terrible deportations in the time of the Nazis.<br /><br />All this as prelude to saying that Barzini does not give a comprehensive description of Italian character, but rather a series of essays which show to the reader aspects of Italian life.<br /><br />The Italians lively, energetic, clinging to their own homes and ways so closely, so richly musical, so passionate in their enjoyment in life , seemed at one time to set a standard for how human beings should live.<br /><br />I do not know how much of this book is dated, and how much Italy today is simply a depleted, demographically dying, aging and tired society.<br /><br />In our recent visit to Italy though I felt a strong sense of the beauty of the place and the beauty of people.	2005-09-18

The fact that this understanding is developed by someone who comes from the Liberal Left, a time when so much of the Left has gone in direction of extreme distancing from any vision of this kind , makes the work to my mind especially valuable.<br /><br />What Berman dares to see is that the United States is not as painted by many of the extreme Left in Iraq out of a colonial urge but rather , whether unsuccessfully or not, out of the countering of a real enemy.<br /><br />Radical Islamic Fundamentalism takes more than one form, whether from Wahhabite Sunni inspiration or from Tehran's Shiite variety, whether through Bin- Laden's Al- Quaeda or from the 'Iraqi insurgents of Zarqhawi. But the threat to the whole fabric of world- civilization is very real indeed.<br /><br />It seems to me that this book might be a tremendously valuable one to those from the truly liberal left, who might come to see where the real threat to our civilization is coming from.	2005-09-15

A good part of the examples presented relate to the tremendous success Palestinian terrorism has had in moving the international community to applaud and reward terror. Today Terrorism is thriving on many different fronts, most of which have some connection with a discontented Islamic group of one kind or another.<br /><br />Since this book was written we have not seen the international community forcefully take a stand in support of the US in its effort to move Iraq to a democratic future. Instead the Sunni terrorists who are daily murdering their fellow Muslims are rewarded by the support, clandestine or otherwise, of Arab  countries.<br /><br />The Palestinians, who have done more for international terror than any other people, have just been given the prize of having Jews removed from Gaza. Their reaction was the burning of synagogues and promises that they will war against Israel until they have destroyed it completely. For these kind actions they were treated as usual with kid gloves by the Western Media, which has an ambivalent attitude towards terror.<br /><br />Dershowitz in this book makes recommedations for American policies including the introduction of identity- cards, which he hopes will stem future acts of terror.<br /><br />Most experts however believe that the cat is already out of the bag, and that the US is filled with sleeper cells , ready to produce the next great mass horror. Let's pray this is not true, and the terrorists have been trying, and have not succeeded to this point.<br /><br />One more point in this rambling review. The US war on terror is compromised by its support of the Saudi Regime. The Saudi Regime has cultivated Wahhabi Islam which is the main source not only of the Osama Bin- Laden way of thought but of most of the radical Islamic terror in the world. The US has not known how to deal with the Saudi problem. And now has a great threat in terror coming from Iran, the threat of nuclear terror.<br /><br />Dershowitz does not outline the full range of problems confronting the West in confronting Terror. But he does show how Terror has paid, and has not been stopped.<br /><br />Unfortunately, if the Western world does not learn to do better against this scourge, all of human civilization , and the worlds of freedom which so many of us have been fortunate to have known all our adult lives, will be severely threatened in the future.threat of nuclear terror.  <br />Dershowitz does not outline the full range of problems confronting the West in confronting Terror.

(The scattered- brain man from the village Azar)<br /><br />Her poetry is a poetry of in- and - outs, of threshholds between different worlds, of windows and mirrors, of the Latvia- Russia European north of her childhood, and the Mediterranean Israel of her late adolescent and adult years. It is a poetry of intimacies and minor inflections, of focusing on small details whose meanings magnify in quiet intonations.<br /><br />As far as I can tell the poems are here very ably translated, and give a real reflection of her work and world.<br /><br />The play is translated by the master translator of Hebrew Drama the late T.

However as a reader of Hebrew it would have meant much more for me had this been in a parallel- text edition.<br /><br />The volume contains one - quarter of Goldberg's collected verse and the editor- translator claims that this includes her most well- known poetry.	2005-09-14

He is close to being the greatest of all aphoristic philosophers. And his writing has a strength, an intensity that profoundly strikes the reader.<br /><br />In this 'summa' of his own thought made before he went off into his last years of complete non- communicability he summarizes his major works, and discourses on and on about the subjects which most disturb and obsess him.<br /><br />One would like to see in this obvious work of genius something worthy of praise alone. For Neitzsche is courageous, he is bold, he is daring and his daring is a daring to truthfulness , in irony even about himself, or what he knows about himself.<br /><br />Yet there is a message which is conveyed in the work beyond the straightforward meaning of the page. It is in the tone and in the stance. It is in the hysteria and the hatred. And this is where my objection to Neitzsche comes.<br /><br />For if he was an opponent of Wagner, and would have despised with all his soul the complete misinterpretation of his message made by the Nazis ( Their collective racism was far from his teaching as I understand it of what the 'overman' should be) the very tone of his hatred and hysteria, the very pose of all knowing certainty , the firmness of his tone and voice certainly transmit something that most hatefilled and evil movement absorbed.<br /><br />For the rest, for the lonely individuals finding in Neitzsche some deep solace( \\"The thought of suicide enables me to get through many a rough night\\") for the critics of certain forms of Western thought, Neitzsche might provide a more excusable message.<br /><br />But the style is also the man, and the man who wrote 'Ecce Homo' was not only not to be compared to the first Christian, he is in some deep human terms , less than wholly commendable.<br /><br />God should give us kinder and saner geniuses.	2005-09-14

But now on many diplomatic, political and military fronts it is creating new challenges for the United States. The most publicized of course is the nuclear front where Iran in defiance of the IAEA continues to work on its enrichment program. But more than this Iran has systematically conducted a campaign of lies and deceptions in order to hide its nuclear program. Berman himself is not sure how close Iran is to nuclear weapons at this moment, but he considers this threat one of the major challenges not only for military reasons, facing the United States today.<br /><br />Iran both in the Persian Gulf and in Central Asia is crowding the United States diplomatically. The outcome of the American effort in Iraq to create a viable democracy is certainly threatened by Iran's increasingly closer ties with the Iraqi Shiite majority.<br /><br />Berman points to the sources of instability in Iran. Its extremely young population the great majority of whom have known nothing but the regime of the Mullahs are restless and discontent. There are high rates of unemployment, and a general sympathetic attitude toward greater liberalization in cultural matters. But all the elements which are working from inside to shake the regime, are as Berman sees it, working at a slower pace than is the diplomatic and military threat Tehran is presenting to the West.<br /><br />Berman details operative policies through which the United States can counter the growing threat from Tehran.<br /><br />This is an invaluable and timely book which every student of US foreign policy would be advised to read.	2005-09-13

And in her great work, ' The Human Condition' she presents an anthropology of her own, in which active man, fabricating world- building man, and contemplative man are placed in terms of historical development, and overall philosophical meaning.<br /><br />This small work touches on some of the major themes of Arendt, including what is in my opinion, the great moral error of her life, the arrogance towards the victims she displayed in writing,'Eichmann in Jerusalem.'<br /><br />It is a good small introduction.

A passionate champion of modernism in Literature he in his pioneering volume 'Axel's Castle' introduced to the American public Joyce and Proust. A college classmate, rival and critical conscience for F. Scott Fitzgerald he also contributed to the promotion and understanding of Fitzgerald's work. As a cultural critic in his monumental work on the Russian Revolution 'To the Finland Station' he showed his great skill in biographical writing, and his capacity for flawed historical judgment. A person with a tremendous appetite for work, a great creative energy (Despite his addiction to alcohol) he late in life studied, learning Hebrew to do so, the Dead Sea Scrolls and wrote an important volume about them. He too late in life published his opionated and forceful journal ' Upstate' In an early novel ' Hecate County' he revealed a sexual frankness unusual for its time. Most importantly though he was a passionate lover of Literature( American Literature especially) and the kind of critic whose writing was not meant for a jargoned academia but for the broad public. His work on Civil War Literature ' Patriotic Gore' is another of his outstanding critical efforts.<br /><br />This tremendous record of literary and cultural achievement is as Dabney so methodically and painstakingly evidences  compromised by a personal life and character less than admirable. Wilson was an uncertain friend,and a poor husband to his four wives. His most famous marriage to the writer Mary McCarthy did have the redeeming element of producing his only son, Reuel, but was a 'nightmare'. Wilson was quick to anger,and a master of verbal abuse. Even with those he genuinely admired and championed most notably  Nabakov he eventually quarreled bitterly with.<br /><br />With all this the story of his life and work is dramatic, interesting, filled with meetings with the central cultural and creative people of his time.<br /><br />His life and work raise and do not answer the question, more extremely perhaps raised by the life and work of a more famous American writer who Wilson did not incidentally think much of , Robert Frost- i.e. how the writer can be so good, while the person so less than admirable.<br /><br />Nonetheless, for all those interested in the literary life, in American cultural history this volume is an invaluable 'must'.ve people of his time.  <br />His life and work raise and do not answer the question, more extremely perhaps raised by the life and work of a more famous American writer who Wilson did not incidentally think much of , Robert Frost- i.e. how the writer can be so good, while the person so less than admirable. <br />Nonetheless, for all those interested in the literary life, in American cultural history this volume is an invaluable 'must'.	2005-09-06

Without delving into the private instances of this it is possible to cite his public behavior.<br /><br />He in Israel insulted survivors of the Holocaust by playing against their will the music which was the signature sound of the Nazis, the music of the violently anti- semitic Wagner. Barenboim too has made violent and racist remarks against Israel<br /><br />even going so far as to speak in defense of Palestinian terrorists.<br /><br />No doubt a brilliant musician but a person full of himself, arrogant and egoistic.<br /><br />Barenboim's book like his life should be skimmed with concentration being placed on the musical parts only.	2005-09-06

The long title story 'Goodbye Columbus' seems to announce that a successor to F. Scott Fitzgerald has at last appeared in the world of American writing. The freshness, the youth , the energy, the romanticism tempered by irony. 'Goodbye Columbus' is not Gatsby but it signals the coming of a great new star.<br /><br />In the other stories too Roth appears with a mastery beyond his age, a techical skill and brilliance, a power of irony, a delightful humor.<br /><br />He also comes with an offensive irrevence and critical view of Jewish American middle - class hypocrisy. But I believe that as Roth himself would later intimate even the fiercest of that criticism ( as it would come late in the true genius work, 'Portnoy') bore in it a tremendous amount of real feeling, identification, love.<br /><br />Roth too is a superemely American writer concerned with the broader American destiny and meaning. His politics are not to my taste but one feels in his writing a real sense of the touch and taste of American life, an exuberant appreciation.<br /><br />These are the first writings of what will become a major American writer.<br /><br />It is interesting that the novel is in my judgment a flat disappointment. And Roth's career does have many flops mixed in with the gems. Perhaps that is the price of experiment or speaking in many voices.<br /><br />But the opening stories, the 'Goodbye Columbus' collection is a winner.	2005-09-05

If I just think of those I know beforehand there is William James famous ' The Moral Equivalent of War' which talks about the place of sport in American life. There is perhaps the most well- known literary essay of the century T.S. Eliot's 'Tradition and the Individual Talent' in which he argues that each new literary work of significance redefines the whole Tradition, makes us see it all in a new way. There is F. Scott Fitzgerald's tremendously moving personal essay on his own breakdown,'The Crack-up' in which he tells us ' in the dark night of the soul it is always three o'clock in the morning. There is James Baldwin's searing essay, 'Notes of a Native Son' and Mark Twain telling us in 'Corn-pone' that where the person gets his core- pone is where his opinions is. It is a typical humorous and brilliant Twain attack on the common-sense conventional mind, and a call for the kind of independent thinking he in his work so exemplified.<br /><br />There are a considerable number of essays on race, on the condition of the blacks in America. Richard Wright, Zola Hurston, Baldwin, Maya Angelou. There are outstanding essays on science by Lewis Thomas, Stephen J. Gould, Oliver Sachs.

For many he is the Reform and Conservative Jews' Orthodox Rabbi. For some he is the person who has gone so far astray from traditional positions so as to be no longer part of Orthodoxy at all. Yet even his most fierce opponents would find it hard to deny that he has been a tireless worker for the Jewish community and world through these years.  And that he has in his thought addressed important questions others dared not approach.<br /><br />One area in which he has pioneered is in Jewish- Christian relations. In this present book he tells in a remarkable autobiographical first- chapter the story of his efforts in these directions.  He in this chapter outlines positions he has been developing for over forty years, positions which involve a radical rethinking of the Jewish relationship to Christianity.<br /><br />This rethinking comes out of his historical knowledge of Jewish- Christian relations, and his understanding of the Christian roots of the Holocaust. More than anything else Rabbi Greenberg seems to be working for a kind of `tikkun' in Jewish- Christian relations that will prevent  disaster in the future.<br /><br />What he proposes is a relationship which goes beyond mere tolerance. He proposes that both Judaism and Christianity each other as valid religious responses, as valid Covenant religions.. Both religions as he understands it have their task, and their chosen place. Both present visions of Divine Redemption which have and can help bring about tikkun olam, a better world, a world more filled with life and goodness. For him Judaism is the senior partner, with its own special niche and relation to God. And Christianity is the religion which has spread the vision of one moral God to a vast share of humanity.<br /><br />Rabbi Greenberg understands the terrible asymmetry in Jewish - Christian relations historically, in terms of persecutor- persecuted.

It is very far however from being ' comprehensive' and at times its choice of subjects seems quite arbitrary. It does not address in a full way the question of why so many of the great modern art- historians from Panofsky and Aby Warburg through Meir Shapiro and Moshe Barasch were of Jewish origin. Nor does it give sufficient mind and attention to the one 'modern Jewish artist' (Chagall) who it seems to me ( and to most others) towers above all other Jewish visual artists.<br /><br />Of most interest to me was the general introductory remarks by the editor Catherine Sousloff, and Larry Silver on Maurcy Gottlieb.	2005-09-04

Its thesis is that the real cause of suicide- bombing is political occupation. And that once that political occupation ends then suicide- bombing will cease to exist.<br /><br />This is in other words a  call for the US to bring home the troops from Afghanistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia or wherever else in the world the US confronts suicide- bombers.<br /><br />This thesis also aims to dismiss the idea that Islamic fundamentalism has a central role in the wave of suicide- bombing which has so intensified in recent years. This thesis however is  contradicted by Caryl Christian  in the September 2005 NY Review of Books. Christian points out that the goals of Al-Quaeda cannot be confined to expelling a particular nation's armed forces from a particular state or area. But rather that their goals have implications relating to the whole concept of global jihad.  He points to another recent work that of Farhad Khoskhavar which studies the cult of martyrdom among educated Islamic youth in the West, the kind of alienated young people who were responsible for the London suicide- bombing of July 7, 2005. Christian points out that the percentage of Islamic suicide- bombings has climbed radically through recent years, and that Pape's thesis made thus more sense some years ago than it does today.<br /><br />\\"Of all the suicide bombing campaigns now underway in the world, most seem to be driven, to some degree, by the grievances of Muslims.<br /><br />So something is changing, and that something has a great deal to do with Islam-particularly with Sunni Islam, and particularly with the aggressive version of Sunni Salafism propagated by bin Laden and his followers. And speaking of homelands-how does al-Qaeda define its own?\\"<br /><br />I would also point out that in many conflicts where suicide- bombers operate what they essentially demand is not an ` end to occupation' but rather a destruction , a total destruction of the enemy. Palestinian suicide- bombers could not really operate in Gaza, but they did operate in West Jerusalem whose population is entirely Jewish. The Palestinian suicide- bombers have always made it clear that their goal is not to remove Israel from Gaza and the West Bank, but rather to destroy Israel entirely.<br /><br />It seems to me that in underplaying the Islamic element Pape distorts the present situation and danger. In Iran the new President speaks openly of global jihad which will eventually make the whole planet part of the house of Islam.<br /><br />For Bin -Laden the `umma `is not a nation- state but is rather the world as a whole as it will be taken over by Islam.not really operate in Gaza, but they did operate in West Jerusalem whose population is entirely Jewish.

It is rich with information about all aspects of Spanish culture and life. Michener was a writer who loved people, and loved talking to them . And this book contains the accounts of hundreds of conversations on all aspects of Spanish life.<br /><br />It describes in great detail some of the main areas and cities of Spain, Madrid, Cordoba, Salamanca, Sevilla, and the Entremurada region.<br /><br />It gives a tremendous amount of detail on different kinds of food and places of accomodation.It is often in this regard very critical.<br /><br />Michener is a very good writer but not a great one. And there are passages of the book which are very interesting but fail to reach a higher level of poetic inspiration.<br /><br />A number of the set pieces in the book are truly wonderful. I greatly enjoyed his account of the medieval Jewish traveler Binyamin Mitudela and the comparison Michener makes between his travels and times and Mitudelas.<br /><br />The book is dated in certain ways. It is of course not up - to- date politically. But also in attitude. I think no editor today would allow the passage in which Michener talks about why all young married Spanish women are fat and content. And how they know in the land of no- divorce their husbands will not leave them even though all the husbands definitely take more attractive women as mistresses.<br /><br />Michener writes a lot about bullfighting a sport he admires. I however found many years ago in the one bullfight I attended a lot of cruelty. I think more people today would share my concern that the cruelty to the animals simply does not justify the glorious spectacle of the bullfight.<br /><br />On the whole I think it is possible to learn a lot from this book about Spain, and too about James Michener.	2005-09-03

It was a required reading work, a rite of passage work for any young person who wished to know the ' literary conversation- pieces' of the time.<br /><br />And it is a ' gripping narrative' a read that holds the reader's interest, especially as it is written in a clean, spare, very understandable prose.<br /><br />Yet I must admit the violence and cruelty which are the central message of the work in regard to what human nature is in essence, turned me off. As an adolescent dreaming reader I was looking for works which would give hope and faith in life. On the adolescent level 'The Catcher in the Rye' moved me to rereading again. And on the more adult level 'War and Peace' seemed to show the complexity and beauty of life in a way which made ' Lord of the Flies' seem to be a narrow- minded cartoon.<br /><br />We may be bad and evil sometimes, and many of us may be bad and evil all the time, but not all of us are evil all the time.<br /><br />The book to use a Faulkner phrase ' had no redemption in it'.

The author sees our Culture as having lost its basis in discipline, and consideration of the others. He sees modern Britain as a society in which people live selfishly for their own individual pleasures without thinking of the good of others, even the good of other family members.<br /><br />He indicates for instance that in less than half of contemporary British homes there is a 'dining table' He says eating has become for most people in England a continuous individual affair. There is no need as when sitting with others to show a modicum of respect and patience. It is one bit of junk gratification after the other.<br /><br />Darymple in pointing to the trend toward ' lack of responsibility' and increasing childishness in the modern world notes how people no longer use the word ' unhappy' They instead use the concept ' depressed' which implies that their condition is a medical use which can perhaps be cured by taking some kind of drug. Saying that they are ' unhappy' might require of them real effort to deal with their own problems and change their life for the good.<br /><br />This fleeing from responsibility also relates to the ' premature adulthood' seemingly given young people today, who may seem to have adult experiences at a young age but who according to the author remain fourteen forever.<br /><br />As one who recently visited England I must report that my experience does not confirm the brilliant analysis of the work. I was there it is true mostly in a geriatic ward of the hospital where most of the people were unfailingly courteous and considerate.But in other places also I found the English to be in general competent and considerate, especially on the road.<br /><br />I of course however know England only superficially. It seems to me that the author's analysis does say a great deal about the modern situation also in the United States and other Western societies.<br /><br />I would also add the originality of many of the ideas here make this work especially delightful to read.he originality of many of the ideas here make this work especially delightful to read. <br />	2005-09-01

What could be more important than teaching the value of increasing kindness and compassion in the world? And this especially when it is done by real- life encounters, contending with situations in which kindness may involve great sacrifice?<br /><br />Nonetheless I would temper the thesis of this book by a word of wisdom from the Jewish tradition i.e. that he who is kind to the cruel winds up being cruel to the kind.<br /><br />That is, no matter how admirable kindness and compassion in many even most situations in life, there are situations where it is not only inappropriate but rather brings great damage. Absolutizing any moral quality in this way, even kindness, inevitably leads to its becoming a kind of mantra, a formula which precludes real judgment decision and right action.<br /><br />The world is filled with cruelty and with selfish mean people.Unfortunately as the psychologist Miriam Adahan who writes on the subject of ' abuse' such people will not be the ones reading this work. It is much more likely that those who value 'kindness' already will be reading this work. This does not however cancel out the great importance of teaching and exemplifying kindness.<br /><br />One other reservation. It might all be well to talk about bonabo monkeys altruistic tendencies but many animals engage in the most vicious and cruel kind of warlike  behavior to their own species. Jane Goodall reported on chimpanzee band wars of the most cruel kind. Wilson has shown how 'ants' engage in the most cruel kind of warlike activity. 'Nature' whatever that is, may not be all ' red in tooth and claw' but it often is. So the way to preach human kindness is not necessarily by pointing to Nature's examples.<br /><br />Kindness as the Jewish religious tradition teaches is the first moral imperative- it is the walking in the way of G-d-it is living in the divine image. We all need to be more kind, but we all too need to have the strength to know when 'the evil' must be resisted.	2005-09-01

His remarkable persistence helped produce some of the most famous photographs of the twentieth century, including the signature- piece photograph of the sailor kissing the nurse at Times Square on V-J Day. Though he presented many pictures of scenes from everyday life in America he is perhaps best known for portraits of the famous, from all walks of life. His Blanchard and Davis captures the pugnacious spirit of the great West Point running duo, his Buckley family portrait captures the casual elegance of America's most famed Conservative intellectual family, his cold camera catches the very epitome of evil hatred in the famed photoportrait of Goebbels, his most difficult subject Hemingway nonetheless projects a somewhat misleading strength and solidity.<br /><br />Eisenstaedt loved his work and lived for it. And there is a certain special kind of light which emanates from his best photographs, the light of life seen into , recaptured on film and presented to us as gift for our immediate viewing and deeper reflection.<br /><br />I by the way strongly recommend reading the more extensive and simply better review by Donald Mitchell of the Eisenstaedt work which also appears on the Amazon site.	2005-08-31

I am not a scientist by training and a good share of the most technical description and discussion did not really make that much sense to me.<br /><br />Nonetheless I learned much from the book. The main premise that there remains much to be discovered and known seems to me indisputable .And this even though there may be realms such as quantum physics where the main map is already largely drawn, and the questions which remain are of more minor significance.<br /><br />The most challenging questions are as I understand it those which relate to the human mind and human situation. It is clear that we are not even close in having a real understanding of how the ' mind ' works. And in a world in which there are so many rapid developments scientifically and techologically it is clear that the major question, of the future of mankind( And our possible replacement or supplementation by other intelligences) has no clear and simple answer.<br /><br />Maddox writing toward the end of the book on the possible disasters of Mankind is especially disconcerting. He does not go into the detail that Martin Rees does in presenting the various ways we may finish ourselves off, or be finished off, but he is disconcerting enough.<br /><br />Above all though I think he achieves his main purpose in the book, and refutes those who want to argue that the main scientific  problems (John Horgan) have already been taken care of.<br /><br />Anyone who studies history or the creative life of mankind knows that so long as we are here and thinking and exploring we will be making and creating new problems and new questions.	2005-08-30

I  have my doubts about the accuracy of this and it seems to me more like a piece of self- advertisment than anything else. Tasteless, even if true.<br /><br />Worse . The editors of the book do not seem to realize that in Literature it is quality that counts, even when one is measuring quantity. It is absolutely insignificant that some person named Jones happen to put the most words on paper in writing a thing he called a novel. It is however of significance that of all the very long novels ever written Tolstoy's 'War and Peace' is the greatest. There is no hint of Tolstoy,Shakespeare, Dante, or any of the other greats of world- literature in the section on literature.<br /><br />Trivia and even quadrivia need  to be more significant than this if they are to be of real interest.	2005-08-30

There are certain travelers one thinks of DeTocqueville who in their journeying provide an understanding of the world they are seeing which is much deeper than any native has. There are travelers even fictional ones like Huckleberry Finn who make of their traveling a rich adventure in knowing places and their characters.<br />Theroux in the few books of his which I have read has I am sorry to say never really seemed to me to get beyond the reported and incidental, the minor personal anecdote which does not illuminate in a deep way.

And if it is at times possible to be impatient with the narrator for his clinging to his obsession, for his continuing to love and need to love the one who no longer needs him it nonetheless hangs together to the end as powerfully convincing.<br /><br />The work is written with great skill and insight.<br /><br />However I believe it does not really make the rejecting wife into a convincing character, in that we do not really see her from inside or grasp what she is truly looking for. In contrast the narrator is most effective when he describes his own feeling.<br /><br />A more powerful conclusion from my point- of- view would have involved a more elaborate meditation on the effects upon the children of their parents' break-up. It is the children who after all are the unwitting victims of their own parents , and in this case especially their mother's terrible selfishness.	2005-08-29

They discuss the meaning of the words, the relation of each blessing to others, the theme of the prayer, and its historical background.<br /><br />This an outstanding introductory guide.<br /><br />For me the test of any Jewish ' sefer' of this kind is whether it is possible to not simply increase one's learning through reading it, but also strenghten one's sense of the meaning and depth of the Jewish tradition.<br /><br />This Sefer handily passes the test.	2005-08-29

Lee Harris may well be such a thinker.<br /><br />In this work he focuses on showing how Western Civilization has developed to a point where it is no longer instinctively capable of recognizing its enemies. Harris sees that the shock of 9/11 was simply incomprehensible to those intellectual fantasists who live in the world of their own ideal goals- and who consequently lack the courage to see the true motivation and determination of their enemies.<br /><br />He argues that Western Civilization led by the United States is in a fight for its life- and must understand this and pursue its enemies with a determination and strength which nonetheless does not degenerate into the kind of immoral murderousness those enemies consistently display.<br /><br />This book is rich in ideas, and strong in rational thinking- although it is somewhat difficult to read.<br /><br />Nontheless Harris raises big questions and provides big answers- and the reader is certainly recommended to test his own feeling and sense of Reality against the hard picture of our world which Harris presents.	2005-07-28

In this volume there are a number of such songs, songs played over and over again, some of which even have taken on a historic dimension. For instance 'Ha-Ish Ha-Hu' is the poem most associated with the life and death of Yitzhak Rabin.<br /><br />Natan Yonatan was a poet of love and of nature. He too wrote many poems about his son and his sons friends. His son who fell in the Yom Kippur War is the subject of the deeply moving \\" Another Poem on Abasalom' \\" Your father loved in you all that he was not, / See now this man trembles all over. Why/ Did you think I would make you king?/<br /><br />Yonatan was a well- known public figure in Israel for many years the editor of Sifriat Poalim, and President of the Writer's Association. He was an outgoing, vibrant personality who read his poems through many years up and down the land of Israel.<br /><br />His poetry is infused with a certain kind of romantic longing. In his famous 'Hofim' poem one can feel the mixture of longing and sadness in the land and for the land and the human soul.<br /><br />Without bombast and without pretentious proclamation he displayed his love and connection with the land of Israel, his intimacy with it through his very deep connection to different layers of the Hebrew language, Biblical, Mishnaic, modern.<br /><br />It seems to me that his poetry in Hebrew has a melodiousness which is essentially untranslatable. And that the whole range of its intonation and special beauty can be felt only in Hebrew.<br /><br />Nonetheless valiant efforts have been made here by translators Janice Rebibo, Richard Flantz , Mel Rosenberg, Karen Alkalay-Gut,Gidi Koren, and the poet's widow Nili Carmel-Yonatan.<br /><br />I close by giving a sample, a translation of one of his best known poems.

In this small work his aim is not to define the undefinable, or know the Unknowable ( The Nature of God) but rather to help human beings strengthen their relation to God, and their sense of meaning in their own lives. He writes,\\"If we believe in God as Creator of the Universe  , then creation has a mighty purpose and life has an infinitude of depth. If man is to find meaning in life, he must seek God's purpose in creation and spend his days trying to fulfill it. The existence of man, a creature who can search for purpose in life, is no longer a mere accident, but the most significant phenomenom in all creation. The concepts of good and evil take on awesome proportions. That which is in accordance with God's purpose is good, while that which goes against it is evi.We are nothing less than partners with God in fulfilling His purpose.\\"<br /><br />As Kaplan understands it the way to understand God is to experience God. This comes in the Jewish tradition \\"through the observance and study of religious teachings.One who does not do this ultimately denies God. Our sages thus teach us that God says, \\"If they would only abandon Me but keep My Torah, its light would bring them back.\\"<br /><br />Kaplan teaches that through the light of Torah and living a life in accordance with its teachings we help bring the Light of God into the world and closer to us.<br /><br />This is a small book , but it has great and essential teaching in it.	2005-07-27

But what he does in effect is try to argue that Jews are anti-Gentile, that this is the heart of their ' evolutionary strategy'(nu?) and that this leads to resentment hatred, and  murder of Jews.<br /><br />He in doing this ignores wholly the fundamental teachings of Judaism which teach that every human being is created in the image of God, and is thus of infinite value.<br /><br />He ignores the fact that the most frequently mentioned commandment in the Jewish Bible is the one about honoring and respecting strangers because the Jews who were strangers in Egypt understand this kind of suffering.<br /><br />He ignores the fact that among the great Jewish contributions to mankind is the idea of equality before the law.<br /><br />And while ignoring the heart of Jewish teaching he also ignores the facts of Jewish history.<br /><br />If Jews are so ' successful ' in evolutionary terms why is it that the Jews who numbered five to eight million people , one out of every ten citizens of the Roman Empire today are less than two tenths of one percent of mankind as a whole. That is had the Jews simply grown at the same rate as the world's population they would be over two - hundred million today, and not around thirteen million.<br /><br />Jews would not be the Chinese but they would be among the larger peoples of mankind.<br /><br />Another important area of distinction which escapes the author is that between the actions of individual Jews and that of those acting for the benefit of the Jewish community. The great majority of ' prominent Jews' have no direct relation to action for the Jewish community. And as Hannah Arendt pointed out often their ' prominence' works against the Jewish community as a whole.<br /><br />One more point. To talk about Jewish successful 'evolutionary strategy' in the same century when over one- third of the Jewish people were murdered is obscene.<br /><br />The Jews are the only people who have not replaced their losses from the time of the Second World War.<br /><br />So where is their ' evolutionary numerical success'?<br /><br />On the other hand , the Jews can say that among their contributions to mankind is the transmission of the idea of One Creator God who relates to each individual human being with love and consideration.<br /><br />This teaching is however one which the author of this particular piece of hate- literature chooses to reject.<br /><br />Instead of this work I strongly recommend readers look at  works by two non- Jewish writers, Thomas Cahill's \\"Gifts of the Jews\\" and Paul Johnson's \\"History of the Jews\\" These works also have the advantage of being in readable prose.murdered is obscene. <br />The Jews are the only people who have not replaced their losses from the time of the Second World War. <br />So where is their ' evolutionary numerical success'?  <br />On the other hand , the Jews can say that among their contributions to mankind is the transmission of the idea of One Creator God who relates to each individual human being with love and consideration. <br />This teaching is however one which the author of this particular piece of hate- literature chooses to reject. <br />Instead of this work I strongly recommend readers look at  works by two non- Jewish writers, Thomas Cahill's \\"Gifts of the Jews\\" and Paul Johnson's \\"History of the Jews\\" These works also have the advantage of being in readable prose.	2005-07-26

Certain kinds of popular culture activities which are considered by most educators to be wholly negative such as game- playing on the Internet, watching Television may increase cognitive- skills, and  raise ' intelligence'. Johnson relies on the Flynt reserach which showed that I.Q. schools in the United States  have in fact been rising over the past decades. Johnson attributes this rise to the increasing complexity of the kinds of popular culture activities a mass audience participates in.<br /><br />He goes on to say that this means that while most educators are deploring the overall decline in book- reading this decline is really no sign of a decline in the cultural and moral level of humanity. There may well be something to this thesis and the figures in regard to I.Q.<br /><br />But it seems to me that Johnson imperfectly understands the true range of meanings of book- reading. First of all, he does not touch upon the spiritual or religious dimension of sacred texts. Secondly, he does not consider the meaning and value of great literature , and why it offers something to the mind and heart no kind of ' game ' ever can.<br /><br />It also seems to me that the kind of ' intelligence' one develops in game- playing or watching television is  different from that which one develops in doing scientific research or technological invention.<br /><br />As someone from the book- culture who does not know the game- world in depth but has watched a bit of television in my time it seems to me that on the question of morality too , Johnson is very much exaggerating. Most of the games that I know of are about ferociously competing to win. Most have no questions or tests of morality involved but are really part of the ' consumer pleasure culture' They are meant to be ' fun'.<br /><br />I would suggest that fun can be fun and is alright but when it is the first value of a society the society will in the long- run suffer.<br /><br />My sense is then that though Johnson may have a point he has done what many writers do in trying to make their own particular point more popular and important than it is- he has exaggerated it to the point where it loses its significance.<br /><br />To add force to this argument I will quote Johnson himself in what for me are the best pages of the book when he tells us what books can do which the game- world cannot.<br /><br />\\" You can convey attitudes and connections in the online world with ease-you can brainstorm with twenty strangers in a way that would have been unthinkable ten years ago.

But how is it possible not to be outraged when one considers that the Times, and its chief during the Second World War Arthur  Sulzberger may well have been responsible ,through their downplaying of the story of the Nazi extermination campaign against the Jews, for not preventing the deaths of tens of thousands of people. Stories from the 'Times ' pointing out the evil of the Nazi plan might have for interested induced the Allies to bomb the rail- lines leading to Auschwitz. And that ' small action' might have saved thousands upon thousands of lives.<br /><br />Moreover Leff does not simply rage out of thin air, but very carefully documents the whole story of the Times action. And she puts especial emphasis on the bias of the then publisher  Sulzberger .His anti- Zionism, his desire to dissociate himself from any national Jewish connection, his fear of having the Times be labeled as a 'Jewish newspaper' all these were part of the formulating of a top- down policy in which the story of what would later come to be known as the 'Holocaust' was downplayed.<br /><br />One feels the author has done a long- due and necessary job.	2005-07-19

It took him thirteen years to get through it one time.<br /><br />In any case this Artscroll should be of real help to those who know some Hebrew and need the English translation to give them the fuller meaning.	2005-07-18

He is also a writer rich in ideas whose analyses and interpretations add new dimensions to the meaning of the works he interprets. In this work of collected essays he writes upon the forebearers of modernity, Renoir , Picasso, Braque, Soutine, Chagall . He also writes about more modern artists  Marin, David Smith. He also writes on TS. Eliot, and on Kafka.<br /><br />In a sense Greenberg was one of the critics who helped define ' modern art'. In this he equated modern art with the 'avant garde'. The avant garde artists were for him those for whom the subject of art had become art itself. The artists and poets he focused upon he understood as being without a kind of secure public that for a period of time in Western Art had supported the 'elite work' which is art. In this he saw Yeats, Rilke, Stevens as Rimbaud, Mallarme, and Valery poets whose real effort was in an effort to make a world of their own art- language and form.<br /><br />We are now nearly half a century since Greenberg wrote these seminal essays. And it seems that while he may well have helped define a moment in the history of Art and even of Literature , Time and History have not stood still. And the question of a content in art and literature which comes from human life and experience, and too relates to our social reality is still with us, and has returned in greater strength. And this while it also possible to maintain that Greenberg's interpretative line really only partly defined the world of for instance a Stevens or a Yeats whose fictional and imaginative universes were too anchored in Key West and Sligo and other real spaces of our own dark beautiful and recalcitrant earth.	2005-07-18

His thoughts on ' envy' will I believe help most readers better understand the subject, and reflect more deeply upon their own relation to it.<br /><br />He points out that ' envy' of all the vices has the least positive to be said about it. About this I am not so sure. Surely most of us are ashamed of envying especially when the other person or persons envied is someone close to us who we should want the good fortune of as much as our own. But envy is not necessarily the worst of sins. We after all often by envying express a certain kind of admiration , and recognition of the value others have which we would like to. Envy becomes truly evil only when it moves us to action to truly hurt another or deprive them of their good. And even then in many instances such ' action'( Think of various kinds of ' fair competition') is not necessarily sinful.<br /><br />Epstein points out that we are jealous of what is our own, and envious of what is others.(which we ourselves do not have) Epstein writes a series of short essays some of which deal with qualities and characteristics of others that we envy, Shakespeare's ' this man's art and that man's scope'.<br /><br />One central point on the whole subject of envy is how foolish we so often are in envying others when they have their own life and story, and fate. Often we envy someone who we believe to have a better fortune than our own only to learn that they have sufferings and troubles beyond those we imagined.<br /><br />'Envy' is a seemingly inescapable element of our nature. And this little book may do an enviable job of helping us  understand it a bit better.<br /><br />And this said with the minor praise of one who might envy Mr.Epstein's talent and success which is considerable.	2005-07-17

In that edition Beardsley maintains he wanted to show the independent value of the aesthetic realm and therefore worked in that direction. In the present revised edition he also tries to bring essays which connects artistic work with other realms of human activity.<br /><br />Anyone who has interest in the Theory of Art should have this volume in their library. And this because it does give a good sampling of the best scholarship on the subject.<br /><br />Beardsley in the new preface to the work talks about a problem he more or less skimmed over in the first edition, ' defining art' . He cites one essay that of M. Weitz who uses Wittgenstein's family resemblance concept to say that it is mistaken to define Art as one set of concepts only when there are ' overlapping concepts' between different realms.<br /><br />But of course making a definition of Art is only one problem of Aesthetics. ( Some by the way might answer in the famous Louie Armstrong style when asked to give a definition of 'jazz' Satchmo said ' If you got to ask, you don't know what it is' . This reminds me in a way of certain definitions of literature such as Kafka's an' axe to break up the frozen- sea within' .<br /><br />But of course the question of intuitive and instinctive reaction as opposed to more reflective response is one of the questions considered in this very rich and valuable volume.	2005-07-15

I share completely the view of one excellent Amazon reviewer who spoke about Sack's special gift for understanding others. His great brilliance and originality in thought combine with a tremendous capacity for listening to, and observing others while respecting them for what they are. His researches seem to thus add a dimension to our sense of the wondrous quality of the human mind and creation. There really is more in Sacks researches, more in his case studies than is ' dreamnt of in our philosophies'.<br /><br />My sense is that this is a fairly representative selection of his work. But my sense is also that it would have been possible to make a remarkable anthology of his work  simply by randomly selecting chapters from his books. His work is that good. Interest does not flag from chapter to chapter but is sustained throughout. I found that true also in regard to his autobiography ' Uncle Tungsten'.<br /><br />All in all then this publication while in no way revolutionary is valuable in that it gives the public a sample of the work of one of the finest writers, scientists, medical people ,and human beings living and working today.<br /><br />All of mankind is enriched by this man's work.	2005-07-15

The neo- conservatives are distinguished from the old - line Republican conservatives. It tells of how this group two of whose prominent figures were Irving Kristol and Norman Podhoretz moved to the center of American political life. And how they and their colleagues became important figures in forming both domestic ( Supply- side economics) and foreign policy.<br /><br />This book is detailed and thorough, but somehow not very exciting. But it is a competent telling of an important chapter in modern American history.<br /><br />A few interesting points.<br /><br />William F. Buckley disassociated himself early from the 'lunatic anti- Semitic right' and this helped in his pushing Conservative thought to the center of American political life.<br /><br />The neo- cons were very concerned to have realistic , practical workable social policies, and were tired of grandiose and empty promises of Liberalism.<br /><br />Neo- cons like Kristol and Podhoretz felt a deep gratitude to America and were alienated by the Leftist hatefilled attacks on American policy.<br /><br />The 'anti- Semitism' of the left did not begin yesterday or four years ago, but Podhoretz and others felt it strongly in the seventies.<br /><br />The Conservative ' revolution' was achieved in good part through the alliance of the neo- cons with more veteran conservatives like Buckley.<br /><br />America seems to have greatly benefited from the neo- con contribution to its political life.	2005-07-14

For James one of the key phrases in the definition is in seeking the ' cash - value' of an idea.<br /><br />What this means is I think, something like this. We ordinarily think of a statement as true if it corresponds to reality, or we believe it corresponds to reality. The test of the truth is in the correspondance. For James the test is not in this but rather in the consequences of the idea in the marketplace. The truth of the idea is its ' uses'.<br /><br />In this way truth- seeking does not look to a prior reality but to a future one. And truth- seeking is not a passive spectator sport in which we simply ' see' the correspondence it is instead a creative activity.<br /><br />The truth is in a sense the way we shape the future out of the present.<br /><br />'Pragmatism'places an emphasis on future facts and empirical realities.<br /><br />Now this said it is important to understand that James is in a sense contending with the whole of the philosophical tradition. He is saying that in its Rationalism and search for some kind of Prior Absolute Idea it is missing the truth that is being made in the marketplace of the world.<br /><br />I believe that there is much which can be said that is ' critical' of this idea. But James would of course welcome such criticism and would contend with it in the marketplace of ideas.<br /><br />'Pragmatism' is a real contribution to philosophical literature and it is important for anyone interested in the philosophical tradition of the West to know it.ed in the philosophical tradition of the West to know it.  <br />	2005-07-14

This means in Sartre's terms that Man is born without an Essence, a fundamental nature. That Nature is shaped instead by decisions, by conscious choice, by our freedom.<br /><br />But human beings, contrary to Sartre are born into family, communal , national , religious traditions. They are born into worlds in which there are values. They do not begin their journeys in life as blank slates.<br /><br />This means that the ' freedom' which Sartre tends to make his absolute (i.e. while denying that we have a nature he makes Freedom our nature) is qualified and limited for all of us in many different ways even before we begin to make conscious choices.<br /><br />Nonetheless the pessimistic doctrines of Marxism and certain forms of Christianity which tend in the direction of a total determination of our collective nature , are rightly criticized and qualified by Sartre.<br /><br />Sartre's celebration of the possibilities of human self- creation and transformation of reality certainly provide a special kind of hope, and youthful sense of our own humanity.<br /><br />\\"We are the makers of what we are, of what we are, and what we are not\\"<br /><br />I would see parallels here between Sartre's existensialim and James-  Dewey American pragmatism.<br /><br />Nonetheless I would want to argue that in negating the importance of our connection with Transcendence i.e. with God, Sartre woefully, and unnecessarily limits human freedom.<br /><br />For for many human beings the greatest free act of their life is their choice to devote their lives to making closer connection with God.	2005-07-13

Nonetheless the ranking of Mohammed as the most influential person in history is bizaare indeed. Mohammed is no doubt the most influential person in history to the one- billion Muslims in the world. But what about the rest of us?<br /><br />Asking the question this way of course reveals the absurdity of the whole enterprise. Now if he wished to choose the most influential person in the world on the basis of the number of people who follow his teachings as a way of life then he should have Jesus as the first. Also if he wished to choose as the most influential the person the most books were written about him he should choose Jesus.<br /><br />But if he wished to choose the first great teacher of the idea that there is only one God in the world, then he should have chosen Abraham. After all without Abraham there is no Moses, and no Jesus and no Mohammed.<br /><br />If he wanted to choose the most influential person for the Jews without which the world would have no Ten Commandments then he should have chosen Moses.<br /><br />If he wanted to choose the most influential and powerful single literary creator of all time then he should have chosen Shakespeare and not left him in place thirty - one.<br /><br />If he wished to choose the scientist who has given us the closest picture we now have to what the physical structure of the universe is he should have chosen Einstein.

I have personally known many people who lost relatives in the Holocaust. And in fact if one wishes to extend this to cousins it is rare to find Jewish families of Eastern European origin who have not lost family members. Thus the first question that always came to mind was; ' How can they possibly do this?'<br />But then the terrible truth emerged. There are people who still support the Nazis because they share the Nazis aims, and are Nazis themselves. The Holocaust deniers are anti- Semites who would like to do away with the Jews.<br />In this work Deborah Lipstadt tells of her trial in which she is accused of having defamed David Irving, who is the most well- known Holocaust denier in the world.<br />She tells of the preparation for the case, and of the decision not to win on a technicality but to go to the heart of the matter i.e. to prove that Irving denied the historical reality of the Holocaust, and to prove that the Holocaust in fact did happen.<br />In the end Lipstadt won the case, and Irving was discredited as a historian . The whole enterprise of ' Holocaust denial' was revealed to be a scholarly sham.<br />However Lipstadt has no illusions about this putting an end to Holocaust denial, or the continued efforts of anti- Semites to harm the Jewish people.<br />I was not at all surprised to find a long piece of Holocaust- denial  on this Amazon review site by one reviewer who denied the Nazis ever planned the destruction of the Jewish people This planning first took place at the Wannsee conference. The Wanssee conference is defined by  Wikipedia as follows: \\"The Wannsee Conference was the discussion by a group of Nazi officials about the \\"Final Solution of the Jewish Question\\" (Endl&ouml;sung der Judenfrage). It took place on January 20, 1942 in the Wannsee Villa overlooking the Wannsee lake in southwestern Berlin and would lead to the Holocaust.\\"<br /><br />Evil persists in the world.

Lowry (A Methuen paperback)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	The life and work of Lowry	This is considered the most complete and authoritative biography of the artist L.S. Lowry. It tells the story of a life of dedication to Art , and of a personal isolation mitigated by friendship. Lowry's great revelatory moment was when his parents and he were forced to move from one side of Manchester, the wealthy, to the other, the world of the mills. It would be the mills, the world of urban hardship and poverty which inspired his most well- known work. And his pictures of the industrial landscape filled with figures of sticklike isolated human beings would become his most well- known work. Later he would change his subject, devote himself more to portraits which were most powerful when they revealed a kind of oddness and sadness of soul in their subjects. That oddness and sadness too characterized in some way Lowry himself.<br /><br />Emotionally his story is of prolonged and close ties to his parents, especially his mother. A petulant dissatisfied woman she nonetheless held him emotionally. He with care nursed her for the last seven years of her life when she was unable to move. And he said after she died that the meaning and purpose had gone out of his life. And in some way he did feel this throughout though in the last thirty some odd years of his life his work was increasingly recognized and appreciated.<br /><br />Lowry lived a ' double- life' as artist and rent- collector, something which he did much to hide. He was known as a good friend and especially generous to young artists after he himself became successful.<br /><br />This work is an exhaustively researched one.<br /><br />I might add, that it focuses on the life. And while there are a number of outstanding passages describing the work , and much background information which will certainly help any student of the work understand it better, the heart of this work is a very careful and skilled telling of Lowry's life- story.	2005-07-12

We look around us for familiar faces and when we see a smile, the smile suddenly turns to be the grotesque laughing of an enemy stranger.We think we are where we are but we are not anywhere where we can tell what this is.<br /><br />And through it all there is a haunting lure of darkness and distress, an atmosphere of Evil about to be done to us.<br /><br />No one can enter Kafka's world unless they read of the long chains of prison within himself , and which give themselves names as his world.<br /><br />The 'Castle ' is not a 'Castle' and the book is not a book. But once we enter them both we will not be able to get out without screaming that the world is far more horrible than we ever dreamed.<br /><br />We will never get out even as we have never been able to enter.	2005-07-12

It was J.D. Salinger who brought me to it. And the central idea that he taught from it was the art of 'aiming without aiming'. Or rather how wrong and forced effort which is wholly concentrated on ' result' and 'result' alone (i.e. hitting the bullseye) leads to missing the mark.<br /><br />The great idea of this work is the idea of a kind of practice which leads to effortless effort, to a 'hitting the mark' without aiming , to somehow allowing one's own inner powers to be in harmony with the task one is doing. To let the whole of one's being flow into the activity and with it as one.<br /><br />With this in mind I years ago wrote a small forgotten work 'Zen and the Art of Swimming' . I also practically ' felt the reality of the main idea ' of this work in surprisingly a ' basketball game ' Here it was not one individual but a whole team of flowing and moving right, only to have this of course be broken by the other- sides time- out.<br /><br />There is a way of doing a thing in which we are so wholly within it that enjoyment naturally comes to us.<br /><br />This is the 'Zen ' I understand as central to this book.	2005-07-12

Salinger, A Biography	Books	3	0	1	N	N	This is not the Salinger biography his fans have long been waiting for	Like so many readers and fans of Salinger I too have had great curiosity about ' who he really is'. So when the Hamilton book came along I was eager to see what he had discovered that was not already well- known. Despite reservations I share with Salinger about the mistakeness of wanting to know more about  the writer than his creation, I did have a look at this work, and learn some new things especially in relation to his family life.<br />But it was more on the level of the sordid than the inspiring. And it seemed to confirm the rightness of the attitude Salinger himself has religiouly promoted, that is of seperating work from life.<br />In any case Salinger's privacy would be hard put upon in later works especially the one by his daughter.<br />This work does however seem to point in a certain direction that is not so wonderful . It seems to suggest that Salinger in life is a far meaner and far less charmingly quixotic character than old Holden or even supiciously holy - Seymour.<br />In any case this is not the Salinger biography his fans have long been waiting for.	2005-07-12

I remember reading it years ago, and how it seemed to me the very opposite of everything America stands for.<br /><br />America in my mind then, was brightness and optimism , a new hope and a new dream. It was moving Westward, and pioneering. It was clear and simple and beautiful<br /><br />Kafka's 'Amerika' is complicated and mind- ridden. It is filled with paradoxes and absurdities, with strange cruel meetings .The atmosphere of nightmare and difficulty that pervades Kafka's work was felt by me then as in absolute contradiction to the American spirit.<br /><br />Of the novels , 'The Castle ' 'The Trial' and this one I find this one the least satisfying, the most incoherent. It is very much a super- incomplete work. 'Incompleteness' is of course part of Kafka's legacy and gift .But here it seems often as if there simply has not been enough time given to the text.<br /><br />I am in any case a reader of Kafka's diaries, parables, stories, shorter works more than I am of his novels which I find somehow tiresome.<br /><br />This is to my mind the least satisfactory of all of Kafka's work.<br /><br />And yet as Kafka reveals to us our own contradictions, paradoxes and fears in a way no one else can- this work too has its meaning and instruction.	2005-07-12

The image is of Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot'. God has disappeared and is not part of our lives and we have to wait for God to return. Or if we are real searchers we would not wait, but would make the effort ourselves looking in various aspects of our experience to find the ultimate religious meaning.<br /><br />But Heschel's premise here is the opposite one. God is actually looking for us. God wants us. I remember speaking with one of the most loving teachers of Hasidism of modern times, the late David Herzberg of blessed memory. When I asked him about the meaning of the religious concept 'Avodat Hashem' service of God' His answer surprised me because it was different from anyone else's. He said it was God's service, God's work what God does to help and connect with us. This is very much like what Heschel is saying here. God is calling out to us ,God is Present  as the Kotzker Rebbe says 'wherever we let God in'.<br /><br />Heschel was a great poetic and religious soul , who feels and teaches God's searching for , and connecting with us.<br /><br />This is a tremendously inspiring and thought- provoking work.<br /><br />I will only say one more word. That as a ' poetic thinker' Heschel's meaning is something suggested and sublime, something we cannot be sure we understand.<br /><br />What we can understand is the underlying tone of holiness throughout this work.	2005-07-11

It is close to half a century ago that he first warned us about 'the affluent society' and the dangers of being too addicted to ' the conventional wisdom' Now at the heroic age of ninety - five he has written this present little work which also aims to wake us up, to stir us to new awareness. And to make us understand that our ordinary present , common- sense understanding of the Economic world is not realistic and true. Instead we live in a world in which we are taken up by a whole list of ' innocent frauds'. The gadfly Galbraith, the truthteller who sees what no one else does is now going to rip the mask off once again. And he is going to lay bare the naked truth of our economic life and reality.<br /><br />However much of the new naked truth corresponds with old truths. As Galbraith himself says  the fact that the stockholders and Board of Directors do not really run companies has been known for a long time through the researches of Alfred Berle Jr. in the thirties. The tremendous power of Management is an old story which takes on new aspects in the Global Age.<br /><br />Another old complaint of Galbraith recycled here is the mistake of looking at GNP alone as economic indicator in regard to the quality of life of our society . One of Galbraith's central themes has been the misallocation of public monies for purposes of private consumption instead of for the overall social and cultural good.<br /><br />This work has then as I understand it much old wine in a new bottle. But Galbraith is still a master vintner, though I sense a bit less irony, humor and happy hatcheting than in the older work.<br /><br />One more point is that the book ends with a bit of an anti- war diatribe. It is hard to argue with the truth that War is Cruel and Evil and is something Mankind would do better to be entirely free of.<br /><br />But it is another to argue that the wars of this century and even the war on Terror that the West is now in simply come out of commercial greed, and the needs of large- scale weapons manufacturers. There are after all geopolitical dimensions to reality which have meaning of their own. Ideological elements ( whether Nazism,Stalinist Marxism or Islamic Fundamentalism) do compel societies which do not wish to live under their rule, to resist them.<br /><br />Even the wise and experienced have no right to foist on us simplistic formulas for the reading, or misreading of complex realities.Terror that the West is now in simply come out of commercial greed, and the needs of large- scale weapons manufacturers.

The book concludes with a list of practical recommendations for achieving this purpose. Among these are the providing of support for scholars of Judaic studies in China, the building of a special center Beijing for Jewish studies, the setting up by American institutions of organizations in China, the bringing together Jewish entrepreneurs and business men with their Chinese compeers, the strong involvement of American Jewry in the whole building of a stronger network of communications.<br /><br />As Wald sees it ( And he is not alone in this) China is a growing power that it would be foolish for the Jews of the world to ignore.<br /><br />I believe very much in the direction of his effort though I believe he does underplay the vast assymetry of the relationship, and does not fully consider the way China even now acts against Israel through its support of Iran. China wants to know and learn and take from everywhere it can. This includes from the Jews.<br /><br />But what can be gotten back from the Chinese is another question.<br /><br />It is clear that the kind of mutual values, shared heritage that exists between the people of Israel and the people of the United States cannot really be emulated by a relationship with two peoples whose histories are by and large so unconnected.	2005-07-10

When in the wake of 9/11 he rallied the City , showed great sympathy for the victims, maintained and inspired a fighting spirit that got the City back on its legs again. Guiliani also had prepared City services beforehand , and was not one of those who turned his back on the warnings of a possible terrible terror event.<br /><br />Fred Siegel who writes this biography was also one of those who helped Guiliani develop his own original strategy for contending with what seemed a collapsing city when he took over as Mayor. Guiliani's novel approach to crime, social welfare, and the economic well- being of the city was responsible for a dramatic turn around in the ' liveability' and ' image' of the City.<br /><br />His toughness, independence, and strong sense of principle made him a figure respected both in the City and on the national scene.<br /><br />This work tells his story including the somewhat problematic chapters of his own personal life.

But there is a great deal of inspirational teaching here .<br /><br />Here is a citation of one teaching of many, many.<br /><br />\\"When we have faith , then our livelihood is like receiving manna from Heaven- we can rely on Heaven to send it to us.This way, we are content with whatever we receive, and have no desire for more and more.Conversely, when a person does desire more than what he is given, he destroys his whole life with the desire for wealth, for there is no manna in that. ( Likutey Halakhot, Netilat Yadayim li'Seudah 6:85)\\"<br /><br />As this little excerpt illustrates \\"Advice is Wise only when it is wisely taken.\\" There is also of course a temptation to interpret such a verse in a way which would free oneself from the need to make any effort at a livelihood. I may be wrong, but I don't think Rebbe Nachman is saying this.<br /><br />In any case I wish that the reader will have the Siyata d'Sheminyah to read wisely even the wisest of works.	2005-07-10

This volume contains beautiful color reproductions of Lowry's work, and its seems to me a highly perceptive description and interpretation of the artist's work by Michael Howard.<br /><br />When I first saw the matchstick like figures of some Lowry's cityscenes I was instantly charmed by it. At the same time it seemed to me to present a childlike primitive even Grandma Moses - like way of seeing things.<br /><br />But later through looking a lot at the work of Rifkah Goldberg ,whose figures have the same kind of stoic immobility that Lowry's do, I began to sense a kind of strange beauty in the work.. It is  the Manchester world of many machine- made or machine- like figures each somehow set off by itself completely alone and isolated , barely able to move and certainly unable to communicate.<br /><br />In one 'family picture' in this work there is a father and two sons . Howard points out that Lowry did not have a wife and children of his own. And that the family presented in the picture is a totally dysfunctional one with each of the people wholly isolated.<br /><br />Lowry painted the sea and smokestacks of the city and the sticklike figures of a matchbox world. Still it feels upon the looking and re- looking at it as if it is a singular way of seeing things, the brilliant gift of a lone and lonely individual to enhance however difficultly Mankind's picture of the world.	2005-07-10

I am not part of the target audience as I am not a woman, and am not a student of Kabbalah or Jewish mystical practices.<br /><br />Still I read the work out of my interest in Jewish life and experience, and in my concern for the Jewish future.<br /><br />I therefore strongly recommend that the reader of my review take it not as any kind of definitive statement, but rather as a subjective view which needs to be complemented by the views of others.<br /><br />The book is  a strange amalgam, but not an ineffective one . It is at once a kind of spiritual autobiography, and introduction to Jewish mystical teaching and practice. It is also and the second part of the work is devoted to this a set of exercises or teachings on how to achieve the meditative and spiritual aims which are Besserman's goal. In this last part of the work there are four Paths given, a Path of Letters, of Emanations, of Sounds, of Song and Dance. My review does not relate to these paths, and whether they are practically useful or not.<br /><br />The story which is told by Perle Besserman is of a girl who found herself confined, and not understood in a traditional religious framework. Her  desire for a closer connection and understanding with God she felt was thwarted all through her time of religious studies. She especially felt that the Judaism she lived and learned was primarily for men. And that women were to be their footstools.<br /><br />She rebelled against this and went on a path of spiritual exploration. As I understand it she abandoned Halachah,  living by Jewish law and instead searched to find her own spiritual truth and way in life. This led her to seek out some of the great Jewish teachers of modern times. And there is an interesting section on her experience with Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook in Israel. There is also most importantly for her the story of her friendship and learning with the Rabbi and Teacher who is considered most responsible for the revived contemporary  Jewish interest in meditation and  mystical practice, Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan. Even with him she was not content with the traditional emphasis on seeing things from the male point of view , and was urging toward his developing or revealing a way of feminine relation to the Divinity, or perhaps the feminine aspect of the Divinity. Kaplan tragically died before her course of learning with him could be completed, and she thus had to strike out on other paths. These included ways of mystical practice which do not have their source in the Jewish tradition. One central source of her learning has been the Buddhist tradition.<br /><br />All of this leads her to finding her own way of transforming mystical teaching which brings her to a deeper and more fulfilling sense of her own spirituality.<br /><br />My  summary  does not do justice to the richness of Besserman's language and learning. She has studied for years and in a way the most valuable part of the book is the knowledge that she does convey about Kabbalah.<br /><br />With all this,  I found her story a not very encouraging one.<br /><br /> On one level, on the level of an individual's struggle and effort and attainment of learning, I admire what she has done. But on the level of a contribution to the world which she comes from, to Jewish communal life, and to the Jewish future I find her enterprise seriously lacking.<br /><br />For what I see in it is simply another individual rejection of Jewish communal responsibility and feeling.<br /><br />There is one incident in the book in which Besserman returns to visit an old friend. This friend was with her a 'rebel' against the narrow 'Beis Yakov' religious school  world. But instead of like Besserman getting out of , she went back deeper into it. She even married the boy Besserman had a youthful crush on. When Besserman visits her she is an ultra-orthodox woman tied down by her growing family, sunk in the traditional woman's role. Their meeting results not in a renewal of friendship but in a misunderstanding in which Besserman is unfairly chased away.<br /><br />Yet the picture presented here, and the drastic dichotomy between the two women and the future seems to me a false one. The fact is that the Jewish people today are suffering from a ' birth dearth.'. We are after the Shoah in demographic decline. And the burden of having a family is not something which is as presented here , a somehow ' valueless limiting thing'.<br /><br /> Today far too many  Jews are escaping into either 'no Jewishness at all ' or a kind of ' non- historical selfish individual spiritualism' which contributes nothing to Jewish community, history and future.<br /><br />There is a Jewish people also. And the absence of relation to it is felt most strongly in this work.sunderstanding in which Besserman is unfairly chased away.  <br />Yet the picture presented here, and the drastic dichotomy between the two women and the future seems to me a false one.

As I understand it the Rambam teaches that the life- in- the - world to come is a life of the soul.<br /><br />  This small volume gives the views of arguably the greatest of all Jewish thinker on an important subject of Judaism. Thus, its great value.	2005-07-08

It is interesting that to the year two- thousand over forty- percent of the science winners came from the United States. And that after this came Britain around fourteen, Germany ten , and France five percent.<br /><br />It is also interesting that though they constitute less than two tenths of one percent of the world's population Jews have one according to the count made in this book , thirty percent of the prizes. This figure is probably somewhat high but still the disproportionate number of Jewish winners is notable. Also certain Protestant sects have a very high proportion of Nobel winners.<br /><br />The analysis however touches upon another factors beside nationality and religion. It considers the educational background of the Nobel Prize winners, and points to universities which have had many winners as students or as faculty.<br /><br />There is also analysis of the ages of winners, and analysis according to gender highlighting the relative small proportion of women who have won Nobel Prizes. This is likely to change in the years ahead with greater educational opportunities for women.<br /><br />This is an interesting study or rather set of studies, and is highly recommended for anyone who wishes to know about the world's most renowned prize for achievements of the Mind.	2005-07-07

The two hundred photographs were from the archive of Frances Broderick, who was a historian of Lansingburgh.<br /><br />When I was growing up in Troy , Lansingburgh was already part of the City of Troy. We used to call it , 'North Troy' or 'The Burgh'.<br /><br />I remember it well because my father Reuben Kelly Freedman of Blessed Memory had his junk shop very close to Lansingburgh.<br /><br />I also remember it because my father's friend the late Freeman Nielsen a brushmaker and true gentleman had his place in Lansingburgh . We would go to visit them on Sunday, and visit also Freeman's only child called 'Sonny' who was in a wheelchair. Freeman's wife, Sonny's mother had died in childbirth, and Sonny had been born paralyzed, and with other serious mental limitations. The care that his father gave him through those lonely years was always an example to us of human devotion and sacrifice. My father used to praise Freeman Nielsen not only as a great craftsman but as a wonderful human being.<br /><br />He was of course only one resident of Lansingburgh.<br /><br />Another was Herman Melville. I can remember standing on the banks of the Hudson and looking across the river in Lansingburgh from a place which supposedly was the place Melville was born.<br /><br />The photos of this album and the description of the author suggest Lansingburgh had an importance in the nineteenth century it did not quite preserve in the twentieth.<br /><br />I always remember it as a district of houses upon houses without any real shopping area, or downtown. I always felt a  strangeness being there, and felt it far far away from home.<br /><br />How strange time and life is, for now writing this more than an ocean and so many years away I feel it close.<br /><br />The work done in assembling this album and somehow reviving a certain time and place in history is admirable.	2005-07-06

It is especially good in its description of the whole industry built around this subject.<br /><br />Nonetheless it is exaggerated and misleading also.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is obesity is a definite health danger. It does make serious inroads in our quality of life. Take a look some time at those who live with their minds intact into their nineties. Almost all of them are thin.<br /><br />Personally like most skinny kids I some time in my life discovered myself to be bothered by my heaviness. Not the aesthetic question primarily which bothers so many others. But the greater difficulty in moving, the more frequent aches.<br /><br />Obesity is indicated in arthritis, in diabetes as well as in the heart- disease- stroke area.<br /><br />It may be of greater damage to go up a hundred pounds and down a hundred pounds. But if you are thirty or forty pounds overweight losing ten or fifteen will make you feel a lot better. It will also make your numbers a lot better at the doctor.<br /><br />The truth is it is hard for many of us after a certain age to maintain a reasonable weight. Exercise, fruits and vegetables , avoiding the most fattening of foods , a moderate reasonable regimen is recommended.<br /><br />Being fat is bad, being very fat is very bad for your health.<br /><br />This may not be the number one problem in the universe, but it is a real one in America.<br /><br />One more point. Rip-off artists, and making a buck out of other people's problems are part of the game. So is showing up the phonys in the business. For showing up the phonys this book is to be commended.<br /><br />For minimizing a real problem and for exaggerating it too should be criticized a bit.	2005-07-06

He was a pioneer in the teaching of Hasidism, and also in the teaching of Jewish Meditation, Kabbalah, Bretzlav Hasidism and much much else.<br /><br />In this work he brings us Hasidic teachings, and primarily the teachings of Hasidism's founder 'The Baal Shem Tov' on a wide variety of subjects.<br /><br />In writing of the relation of Kabbalah and Hasidism he says,<br /><br />\\" In many ways Hassidism was a logical extension of the Kabbalah - but with an important difference. While Kabbalah brought man to God, Hassidism brought God to man. Kabbalah raised the initiate to the upper worlds, offering him a glimpse of the Holy Domain , along with its angels, emanations, vessels and luminations. Hassidism, on the other hand, did just the opposite. It brought the Heavenly Domain down to man, showing him the type of life and dedication that it predicated. The Biblical lesson,\\" Know Him in all your ways\\", became a watchword of the Hassidic world. \\"<br /><br />There are chapters on God, Creation Man,Israel and the Torah, Faith Love and Reverence, Meditation and Prayer, The Commandments,Torah Study,  The Sabbath and Holy Days,Life and Society, Sin and Repentance, Divine Providence, The Ultimate Future.<br /><br />Along with the writings of the Baal Shem Tov which make up over half the text there are other works from the other great master of Hasidism that tell about the Baal Shem Tov's teachings. There is the ' Kedushat Levi' and ' Degel Machane Ephraim' and 'Keter Shem Tov' There are passages from 'Noam Elimelech' and 'Midrash Pinchas' and 'Avodat Yisrael'.<br /><br />There is a whole world of Judaism in this work. It could not be more highly recommended for uplifting the Soul in the worship of Hashem.	2005-07-06

I think Aristotle died 'of' Chalcis Eubeoa\\") Also others featured here, Carson who passed away this year who gave so many Americans their nighttime entertainment, and George Burns who with his, \\"Gracie.Say good night\\" always brought a smile. And even Joey Bishop who never seemed to me in the least funny , and Woody Allen( Unlike everyone else who reviewed this book I did not find his interview either interesting or funny, though I admit he has made a few clever remarks in his time. ie.\\" I don't want to be an immortal.

The Ray was not a lamdan who happened to have and use a smattering of general culture, and he was certainly not a philosopher who happened to be a talmid hakham, a Torah scholar....

Norbert Wiener who would go on to become an important mathematician and one of the principal developers of communication theory, and his own specific discipline 'cybernetics' tells here the story of his most unusual childhood and youth. At the center is his relation to his father Leo Wiener who was a Professor of Slavic Languages, and an extraordinarily ambitious person. He pushed his son from an early age in much the same way that John Mill pushed John Stuart Mill. In the process he was often cruel. \\"He would begin the discussion in an easy, conversational tone. This lasted exactly until I made the first mathematical mistake. Then the gentle and loving father was replaced by the avenger of the blood.... Father was raging, I was weeping, and my mother did her best to defend me, although hers was a losing battle.\\" The father pushed Wiener so well that he enrolled in Tufts University at the age of eleven finished four years later with a degree in Mathmematics. The father was also a publicity - hound who publicized his son the genius, and claimed it had nothing to do with any genetic quality or special gift of his son, but rather was solely attributable to his own educational methods. The father too saw too it that the son had a family life, and selected one of his students to be his son's wife, and practical daily life manager.<br /><br />Wiener despite all this went on to become a distinguished MIT professor of Mathematics, an original genius and a highly respected teacher.<br /><br />This autobiography is one of two and there is another work by Wiener covering his later years.<br /><br />However anyone who wishes to know the life- in full should also look at the biographical literature, that contains much about the life of genius he himself did not apparently wish to tell.	2005-07-04

It is told by Judith Grunfield a pioneering Jewish educator who had a central part in this operation, and in the subsequent education of the children. Most of the children had been rescued from German speaking part of Europe by the courageous and innovative actions of Rabbi Schoenfeld . Many of them left their parents never to see them again.<br /><br />The Gentile English villagers were somewhat confused at first by the strange customs of the Jewish children. The Jewish children all politely refused to eat the first big meal they were offered, a juicy ham dinner. But in time the villagers came to understand and respect the Jewish children, and were generous in helping them.<br /><br />The devoted educators that Grunfield speaks of saw too it that both the Jewish education, and the education which would enable them to succeed in English society were given in an appropriate way.<br /><br />Most of the children who went through the years of Shefford went on to make good family lives and careers for themselves.<br /><br />The book would have been even more moving had Grunfield chosen to tell us many of the individual stories. She does tell some .For instance of one little girl who refused to be in any way at rest until she was with her brother. Her brother had been left in Europe and somehow through the devices of Rabbi Schoenfeld was reached, and brought out.<br /><br />The story occurs of course against the background of the terrible destruction of the Holocaust. Of course many of the children as I said before, never saw their parents again.<br /><br />This episode of Shefford and the generous people there is called by Grunfield a ' sliver of light'.	2005-07-03

For that is of course impossible to learn from anyone, but rather can only come as a gift of God.<br /><br />Botton does however try to teach lessons about certain aspects of Proust's experience which he believes most of us can learn. Some of these relates to the theme of suffering, which Proust certainly was a fine expert in, and the other jealousy and love.<br /><br />It is strange but I in reading Proust never believed that the kind of degradation in suffering he found so fascinating is something most of us would be very wise to imitate.<br /><br />I also found the Proustian torments of jealousy and absence something not so much unreal, but truly secondary in what might be called a different kind of love drama or story.<br /><br />Is there in Proust's world a single story of love based on mutual respect, understanding, on kindness , on consideration, on recognition of the autonomy of the other, on real physical intimacy and pleasure which also has an element of sanctity?<br /><br />I don't think so.<br /><br />This is an amusing book, but it does not touch upon worlds which I believe are much richer in human blessedness.	2005-07-01

"Laughter" by Henri Bergson	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Two major theories of ' comedy'	This review is partial, and does not include the major essay of Wylie Sypher that serves as epilogue for the essays of Meredith and Bergson.<br /><br />Meredith, Bergson, and Freud are among the few who so far as I know  have  presented major theories of comedy and laughter. Meredith's discussion of comedy involves a distinction between the low comedy of laughing, slapstick and its varieties, and the high comedy of intellectual perception. This latter is his main interest and involves as he understands it our discernment of some distinction between ideal and real. It is this high comedy which is a moral corrective and enables us to put the arrogant, and rude in their place.<br /><br />For Bergson the theory is a theory of laughter. It has to do with his own major philosophical distinction between the 'mechanical ' and the ' spontaneous' between the rigid and that which flows. For Bergson laughter can come at our observation of someone walking along and falling down, comes as some kind of break in the expected pattern of motion and action.<br /><br />Neither of these theories begins to cover all the different kinds and ways we smile and laugh at others. They are , as I understand it a start at trying to find the essence of a set of realities which may in fact have more than one essence.<br /><br />These works then as I understand it are invaluable starting points for thinking more deeply about the subjects of what comedy and laughter are .<br /><br />And writing this I am quite dismayed how humorless it is.<br /><br />And this as if to remind that true comedy ( at least as literature( requires a power of invention and creation out of the ordinary.<br /><br />Is this perhaps the ' germ' of another way of thinking about comedy i.e. as a special kind of human inventiveness involving surprise	2005-06-29

But these are cancelled out by being among some of the greatest popular song lyrics ever written.<br /><br /> Perhaps  the lyricist is almost absolutely dependent on the quality of the ' melody' in order to have his words become memorable as part of a great song.<br /><br />Ira Gershwin in this was fortunate enough to work with some of the greatest of all writers of popular song, first of course and above all his brother, George.<br /><br />As I write this I am humming the melody of the Gershwins' classic \\" Embraceable you\\".<br /><br />How much pleasure and delight did these two great brothers give, and how much do they still give, to the world.	2005-06-29

Thus I have nothing to say about the latest innovations, whether politically correct or not. And certainly I have nothing to say about the Music of the middle and latter parts of the twentieth century.<br /><br />I read this book as a university student many years ago.<br /><br />I found it had two great virtues. First it gave a sense of the whole development of Western Music. Secondly it gave a real sense of the composers' lives and struggles, and what went into the making of their music.<br /><br />If I recall it had wonderful little epigraphs setting off each chapter.<br /><br />It gave the real sense that later composers learned from and developmed from earlier ones. I think now of a certain parallel in the histories of Western Art and Western Literature. New techniques emerge in all these areas as a result of an overall process of development.<br /><br />How different that is from saying ' each point of history' is ' equal' to every other, and what happens in ' one time' is essentially as good a ' starting point' for ' relating to the whole ' as what happens in another.<br /><br />It seems to me in this sense that the original Machlis textbook reflected a different attitude people had about culture and life in the West. I may be wrong, but it seems to me there was a 'more hopeful' sense of ourselves even in Music.<br /><br />I am not an aficionado of modern music, and do not know where we are now. I did sense that when we had gotten in this text to Schoenberg and then still later to Cage , when we had come to music which was ' not pleasant to listen to' some kind of note of doom was being sounded.<br /><br />But overall, this was a truly enjoyable text to learn from.	2005-06-29

Show- business biographies tend to feed upon some of the lowest levels of human curiosity, our instinctive desire to know the dirt and the smut of the celebs. Eddie Cantor was however as show- business people go , and they will all forgive me for this, a very decent, honest, hard- working and good person. In this autobiography of two parts he tells of the long road from a little East Side tenement on Eldridge Street all the way to the Colgate Comedy Hour . He did it all on the way including vaudeville and all the road - shows imaginable.<br /><br />He was the most peppy of all of entertainers filled with life and fun. A little guy with big eyes , whose trademark  was rolling them he would talk on Sunday night about his wife Ida and his five- daughters just before or after rendering an always upbeat ' Jeepers Peepers where'd you get those peepers, Jeepers Peepers , where'd you get those eyes?'<br /><br />He was essentially an entertainer as cheerer- upper. He didn't leer or threaten he smiled and danced on. Along with Jolson and Jessel and a bit later Uncle Milty he was an American household word. I can remember his bringing that young great hope his protege ( The son he did not have) Eddie Fisher on the stage for his great debut.<br /><br />Cantor was in Joe Franklin's words ' the greatest', if by the greatest is meant a very good, helping person in a very hard cut- throat world.<br /><br />This volume also has C.D.s with so those who never heard him, which I suspect is most of the world now alive, can get a feeling of it.

His researches were in a wide variety of areas including nuclear science, genetics, molecular biology , X-ray chrystallography, mineralogy, physical chemistry.<br /><br />The most valuable parts of his memoirs are his descriptions of his own scientific work and discoveries.<br /><br />Pauling's motto was \\" Never put your trust in anything but your own intellect\\" and he was a tremendously independent researcher, and thinker.<br /><br />His reputation and his great work were in science, but he also thought out loud and independently on political and health subjects.<br /><br />I remember hearing him talk years ago at Harpur College in Binghamton New York. I was expecting to hear him talk about his scientific work and discoveries. Instead he went on endlessly about Vitamin C as a cure to all our health problems. Yes, Pauling along with being a pioneering intellect and scientist was a crank also.<br /><br />His crankiness had its political side in his Pacifism , a pacificism which led to his being accused of being a fellow traveler.(i.e.Communist ).<br /><br />In fact the idea that nuclear war is insane is one of the most sane ideas imaginable. But equating the US and the late Soviet Union as Pauling often did was mistaken and wrongheaded.<br /><br />Above all it is best to think of Pauling as a scientist. The enthusiasm he had in exploring nature is felt throughout this work.<br /><br />He believed himself and other scientists fortunate in that he thought scientists could appreciate and enjoy so much more of the world than others.<br /><br />He was a true American original , a pioneer researcher at the highest level, and not without a  certain sense of humor.<br /><br />This book may not bear a cover- to - cover reading but whoever looks and searches in it will find much material for the investigating human soul.	2005-06-28

Upon beginning to write about them I invariably discover how much time I gave to something which seemed so worthwhile at the time, and which I have almost completely forgotten. I then ordinarily do some catch- up learning about the book. And my review becomes an amalgalm of distant past and most recent present impression. And meanwhile the heart of the book is forever unknown to me and lost. And my review is only a minor tracing an impression both of the book itself and what of my mind knew when reading through it.<br /><br />This certainly applies to my reading of this particular work, ,the one work of Levi- Strauss which I remember reading with any degree of real understanding and pleasure. His making of a life and career as an anthropologist which are a good part of the first part of the work interested me then.<br /><br />The long travelogue and explorations into Amerindian society and mind, interested me less.<br /><br />I understand though  that the real voyage is into and along with the mind of Levi- Strauss itself, a mind much more complicated than I was ordinarily used to meeting and ingesting .<br /><br />I do remember however the somewhat majestic tone, the tone of restrained sadness of quiet mourning which seemed to go through the work as Levi- Strauss met with worlds being lost and deterorating , in part through their  meetings with the very kind of Western mind he himself exemplified.  It is the mind destroying the object in the process of knowing it , as the Western explorers of these tribal societies transformed them out of their own natural state by meeting with them.<br /><br />For Levi- Strauss and this I remember, the ' primitive mind' is not ' primitive at all' and may be in its linguistic complexity and social structure far more intricate than the ' civilized ' as it were sophisticated worlds we believe we live in.<br /><br />I read this work as a way of being acquainted with a great mind, a mind which to my mind proved to be quite elusive and even distant.<br /><br />But clearly the exploration made by Levi- Strauss of his own inner and external worlds is one which calls to the curious human mind and heart in its quest for understanding ' of the other'<br /><br />Montaigne took a trip in the  Brazilian jungle  in the twentieth<br /><br /> century, looked in the mirror and saw the face of Levi- Strauss.which to my mind proved to be quite elusive and even distant.<br /><br />But clearly the exploration made by Levi- Strauss of his own inner and external worlds is one which calls to the curious human mind and heart in its quest for understanding ' of the other'<br /><br />Montaigne took a trip in the  Brazilian jungle  in the twentieth<br /><br /> century, looked in the mirror and saw the face of Levi- Strauss.	2005-06-28

I think of reports made from all kinds of whistle stops on Presidential campaigns.  I think too of his capacity for friendship, and how that does move through these letters and give them a warmer feeling of comraderie.<br />I think also of Cooke's basic real affection for America, his interest and appreciation of much what is good and beautiful in it.<br />I think too of how many listeners he delighted with his wit, and dry humor and clear - cut language.<br />This is a lifetime work of special meaning and value for the many thousands who waited each week for those fifteen minutes of his often most delightful and insightful talk.	2005-06-28

During the twenties and thirties poor Jewish boys who had no other way up the economic ladder went into the ring. Bodner says that during that time over thirty- percent of the professional fighters were Jews. And so were many of the trainers and managers. And so it was not anti- Semitism or ' showing that we are just as tough as the Goyim' that put these people in the ring.<br /><br />A good share of the fighters got out in time, before they were ' punch - drunk' and went on to make respectable lives for themselves. They married had families of their own, and did not send their children into the ring. In this they were much like Jewish mobsters, a one- generation phenomenom.<br /><br />An exception to this rule was a Jewish fighter who lived down by the Hudson River in old shack in Troy, New York, the late Joe Bedell. He had once been a leading contender, and my father used to visit him when he had no one else in the world. His story was a different one, of a man who had known two minutes of glory in the ring, and had for whatever reason just dropped out of life.<br /><br />I in my childhood knew this world of the Jewish fighter quite well. One of the pictures my father had in the Junk shop, and which my brother, Jake Freedman, who was also a Jewish fighter at one time, loved was of a bloody- faced Abe Attell fighting for the featherweight title, I believe against Joe Gans.<br /><br />As opposed to what Bodner says in this fine book there was I think a large element for many Jewish youngsters of proving how tough they were, and disproving the old taunt that Jews ' can't fight'<br /><br />In regard to reenforcement of this theme  a previous fine book which chronicles the story of Jewish sports figures including Jewish boxers is Harold Ribalow's 'The Jew in American Sports'.<br /><br />This outstanding  book gives a nostalgic picture of another world and another time.<br /><br />Its main theme is summarized in a saying of the late great Reuben Kelly Freedman who was a bit of an amateur Jewish fighter himself<br /><br />,\\" The only good fighter is a hungry fighter'the late great Reuben Kelly Freedman who was a bit of an amateur Jewish fighter himself <br />,\\" The only good fighter is a hungry fighter'	2005-06-27

This is one of de Rougemont's key questions. And it seems to be based on his sense that the only true passionate love, is adulterous love, the love of the forbidden, the hidden love of the knight for the Lady who belongs to another.<br /><br />In tracing the 'Myth of Love' in the Western literary tradition through the past seven centuries de Rougemont finds a central theme, that the Love of Passion, the Love of Eros is not the love of Agape, the Love of Christian charity. It is instead that sinful forbidden love for the one who one has no right to.<br /><br />Here I do not doubt that de Rougemont has isolated a central motif , theme , ' topoi' of Western Literature, and perhaps of Literatures, not Western also. I do not wish to minimize its importance , and as I write this the image of 'Bovary' and 'Anna Karenina' both come as its confirmation.<br /><br />Yet there also is in my my mind the image of another kind of Love, Biblical love,  of Abraham's love for Sarah, of Isaac's for Rebecca, of Jacob's for Rachel. Those loves, at the beginning of one side of the Western Literary tradition seem to me to suggest a kind of passionate intimacy , whose model is sanctity. That is to say against de Rougemont I would want to say that there is a kind of passionate love in marriage , outside the Romantic as he sees it, and this passionate love is the love of Kedushah of holiness. It is too the kind of love which Tolstoy portrays in his parallel- couple to Anna and Vronsky, Kitty and Levin.<br /><br />In any case the rich suggestiveness of de Rougemont's study and the depth of his thought make it a , at times dense and difficult , but also particularly meaningful work.	2005-06-27

James Watson who was then a twenty- four year old visiting American scientist worked with the team of the British Francis Crick , and this team succeeded in beating the Linus Pauling team to the discovery. There are of course many ' doubles' in the history of science, perhaps most famously Newton- Leibniz invention of the differential calculus, and Darwin- Wallace's discovery of evolution through natural selection. But the ' double ' here was avoided in part by Crick- Watson's fierce competitiveness, and making use without permission of the work of another .(Rosalind Franklin) In other words the story here is valuable in being  a realistic ( if incomplete) story of how this monumental discovery was actually made. But it makes in a way the whole process seem if not less exciting, than less emotionally and spiritually satisfactory than one would like in regard to a discovery of such great importance. Compare the kind of wheeling and dealing done by Crick and Watson with Wilkins in filching the Franklin work, with the very different spectacle of Einstein alone through thought- experiments wholly transforming the way we see the world.<br /><br />I also to tell the truth did not find the Watson who tells the tale a particularly likeable character, and Crick even less so.<br /><br />This book however does give a real sense of how scientific work is often done, and does in its best moments provide a sense of the excitement of great discovery.	2005-06-27

One particular helpful feature of the work is the detailed chapter- headings, which serve as a kind of summary of the work as a whole.<br /><br />The story of 'Dizzy's spectacular climb ' up the greasy pole' to the Prime - Ministership, his rivalry with Gladstone, his closeness with Queen Victoria, his brilliance as strategist in defending and extending the Empire is told with quiet sympathy by Blake.<br /><br />Also there is a close chronicling of Disraeli's personal relations, including those with his somewhat distant literary father, his  especially supportive sister, and very close wife.<br /><br />Disraeli's Jewish origins , his misunderstanding of them and yet his pride in defending them are also part of the story of this sensitive, insightful and supremely  'romantic' political leader.	2005-06-27

Plus update	This book was published in October 2003, and this review is being written in late June 2005. This is important because even though the fundamental picture of Anti- Semitism in the Islamic world, in Europe, and to a lesser degree, the United States is valid there is an element of Schoenfeld's analysis that has already failed to pass the test of time. When he wrote the work there was a great deal of hope that the US effort in Iraq would effect a fundamental transformation throughout the Middle East, toward Democratization, and with this reduction in Terror, and even reduction in anti- Semitism.<br /><br />But as it appears now the situation in Iraq is a quagmire. Defense Minister Rumsfeld said a few days ago that the Iraqis would have to win it ' by themselves' indicating that the US might leave fairly soon , and with it leave a big mess. This summer there is also planned the Israeli disengagement from Gaza which is being interpreted by all Palestinian groups, and especially the Terror groups as a victory for violence.<br /><br />In other words the reduction of anti- Semitism hoped for by Schoenfeld in this book does not seem on the way. In opposite the election of a hardliner President in Iran earlier this week, who referred to Israel as an ' illegimate state' only underlines how strong Anti- Semitism in the form of Anti- Zionism is in the<br /><br />Islamic world.<br /><br />And here one warning made by Schoenfeld is extremely timely. He shows how many Jewish leaders, including Louis Marshall believed that the Nazis were just a bluff, and would go away of themselves. It seems to me that anyone who thinks a bit about Jewish history should understand that the fundamentalist terrorists who are threatening destructive action to Israel are not just going to go away. It is extremely alarming that when a month ago the leading Islamic clergyman connected with the Palestinian Authority called for ' the genocide' of all the Jews in the world , no one paid attention. There was no outcry. Israel did not even attempt to intervene.<br /><br />Schoenfeld outlines a situation of increasing danger for the Jews through the actions of anti- Semitism. Since he wrote the book the dangers have only increased. And here I would point out that the greatest dangers are what might be called ' state- anti- Semitism', and especially the state Anti-Semitism, of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority.<br /><br />The return and intensification of the one world's oldest ' social diseases' ought to be I want to suggest a source of worry not only for Jews, but for all those who care for human dignity and freedom.<br /><br />For if the Islamic world succeeds in its goal of destroying the Jewish state this will not simply mean the end of one small democracy in the Middle East. It will be a signal that Terror and Totalitarian violence are on their way to taking over the world.l did not even attempt to intervene.  <br />Schoenfeld outlines a situation of increasing danger for the Jews through the actions of anti- Semitism.

He knew his fellow late Stoic philosophers well, and his wisdom is much in accord with theirs.<br />As Epictetus taught what is not in our control is not for us to worry about.<br />Marcus Aurelius shows his concern for us in other ways, in teaching us how to bear the pains and sufferings of this life, and to minimize the pain.<br />We are after all, even the Emperors among us, merely minor specks of dust in a vast cosmos in which there is great darkness.<br />The wise words here are for a time of trouble, a time of war at the borders, a time of imminent decline, a time when Hope seems to be going out of the world.<br />Contrast the wisdom of others lives at other times. Wordsworth's 'Bliss was it to be alive that day , and to be young was very heaven' Or Whitman's \\"Do I contain contradictions.Well then I contain contradictions.

In other words this particular book is one - chapter of a much larger volume , reprinted at the centennial neither of Einstein's birth or death, but of his annus mirabilis 1905 when he wrote the five papers that revolutionized Mankind's understand of the physical world.<br /><br />Einstein was sixty- seven when he wrote this , and he in his usual lightly humorous vein said that it might constitute an ' obituary '. In fact Einstein lived for nine more years. But of course the great scientific work was done over twenty- five years before he wrote this sketch.<br /><br />In the sketch Einstein traces his own scientific development, and describes briefly his major discoveries.<br /><br />He also explains at the outset his early understanding that the world of human wishes, desires and subjectivities was not to be his prime realm of concern. He wished to be among those who lived in what he regarded as the refined realm of understanding the physical nature and world as a whole. The quest for the impersonal and objective truth through the hard work of thought is the central theme of Einstein's life. And if it yielded him long years of frustration it also provided him with miraculous revelation of a kind the world as a whole would come to wonder at, and be transformed by.	2005-06-26

Another Amazon reviewer has pointed out that it omits Einstein's writings on science which he rightfully says is something like speaking about Mozart without speaking about his music.<br /><br />Yet Einstein was already by 1932 a world - figure. And one of the great tests of his life, and proofs of his being , beside a great genius, a very decent and moral human being , was the way he reacted to the Nazis.  When they were beginning their racist attacks on the Jews, Einstein proudly announced his Jewish origin. Instead of trying to play up to authority as did for instance Heidegger he showed an ability to sacrifice his own private position within Germany , then the great center of scientific research.<br /><br />This volume contains a chapter on his relation to the Germany of the time. It also contains a more extensive chapter on his relation to the Jews, to the building of a homeland , to the conception of peace between Jew and Arab in the Holy Land.<br /><br />The volume opens with Einstein's reflections on the meaning of life, and on the way he sees the world. They come , I think, very much out of his own sense of himself. Einstein highly prized the private individual. He believed that the individual did not exist to be absorbed in or be a slave to the State, but rather the State existed in order to enable individuals to pursue their lives and creative endeavors. In this work he champions the political system of the United States because he believes it best enables individuals to find their way to real creative and productive human endeavor.<br /><br />He says,\\"The real valuable thing in the pageant of human life seems to me not the State, but the creative, sentient,individual , the personality: it alone creates the noble and sublime.\\"<br /><br />Einstein in his humble away talks about the dependence of the individual, of himself on the contributions of so many others in society.<br /><br />And he talks about the fundamental values for which he has lived, Truth, Goodness and Beauty.<br /><br />When one thinks of the other outsized giant of science, Newton and compares Einstein with him, one is again struck at how remarkable it is that a person of Einstein's incredible genius in scientific work, should also have been in so many ways a decent, sane, moral human being.<br /><br />Mankind is enriched by his being one of us.ndamental values for which he has lived, Truth, Goodness and Beauty.  <br />When one thinks of the other outsized giant of science, Newton and compares Einstein with him, one is again struck at how remarkable it is that a person of Einstein's incredible genius in scientific work, should also have been in so many ways a decent, sane, moral human being.  <br />Mankind is enriched by his being one of us.	2005-06-26

Widiger lists three incontrovertible principles of Malthus:<br /><br />\\"That population cannot increase without the means of subsistence, is a proposition so evident, that it needs no illustration.\\"( But of course today we have population declining in many areas of the world where food is superabundant. In otherwise Malthus did not foresee the kind of demographic transition Mankind is going through, precisely in those societies which have freed themselves completely from living at subsistence level.<br /><br />)<br /><br />The second principle is as  follows:<br /><br />\\"That population does invariably increase, where there are the means of subsistence, the history of every people that have ever existed will abundantly prove.( Again this is no longer the case. We are according to demographers such as Ben Wattenberg and Kenneth Longman living in a ' birth dearth' era at least in the most advanced societies of Europe.)<br /><br />The third principle is:<br /><br />\\"And, that the superior power of population cannot be checked, without producing misery or vice, the ample portion of these too bitter ingredients in the cup of human life, and the continuance of the physical causes that seem to have produced them, bear too convincing a testimony.\\"<br /><br />In opposite ,the global transformations involving movements of masses of people from the countryside to the city,the increase in the level of education of women, the invention of safe means of contraception have all taken the ' necessity' out of Malthus 'law'.<br /><br />We live in a different situation than the one he envisaged. And even if global malnutrition does persist, it does not persist because of problems of scarcity but rather of distribution.<br /><br />All of this of course,  does not diminish Malthus genius, or the rightful place he has in the history of social science.

His humor and modesty and wisdom are everywhere in evidence. Einstein's writing often has an aphoristic quality, and there are many memorable sayings in the work.<br /><br />A small sample of them follow:<br /><br />\\" As for the search for truth ,I know from my own painful searching , with its many blind alleys, how hard it is to take a reliable step, be it ever so small, towards the understanding of that which is truly significant.\\"<br /><br />\\"With fame I become more and more stupid, which of course, is a very common phenomenon. There is far too great a disproportion between what one is, and what others think one is, or at least what they say they think one is.But one has to take it all with good humor\\"<br /><br />\\"Where the world ceases to be the scene of our personal hopes and wishes, where we face it as free beings admiring, asking and observing, there we enter the realm of Art and Science. If what is seen and experienced is portrayed in the language of logic, we are engaged in science. If it is communicated through forms whose connections are not accessible to the conscious mind but recognized intuitively as meaningful ,then we are engaged in art.Common to both is the loving devotion to that which transcends personal concern and volition.\\"<br /><br />This volume touches upon many sides of Einstein, his humanitarianism, devotion to peace, his Zionism, his sense of the beauty that is to be revealed through the objective understanding of  the universe.\\"<br /><br />The book takes the form of the questions his correspondents asked ( Most often given in paraphrased form by the authors of the book) and Einstein's responses to their questions.<br /><br />If I had one question to ask him it would be, \\" How is it that it was given to one human being in one relatively short period of time to totally transform  Mankind's understanding of nature?

It is the picture of a person of enormous dedication, of a startling power to devise in his own mind ' thought- experiments' that would lead to changing completely mankind's conceptions not only of the world but of its own powers.<br /><br />It is the the story of Einstein's reluctant political involvements, his devotion to peace, his great humanism, his Zionism and contribution to the building of Hebrew University, his opposition to Fascism, his famous letter to President Roosevelt that pushed the Chicago project for building the Atom bomb, his torments of conscience over his discoveries having been used in war.<br /><br />Most importantly it traces the scientific career of Einstein including the legendary moment of great triumph in 1919 when his general theory of Relativity was experimentally confirmed, and Einstein transformed overnight into a world- famous figure.<br /><br />It also tells the story of Einstein's struggle for over thirty- five years throughout the whole latter part of his life to devise a unified field theory .

I would also emphasize a point that Pelzer himself makes in this excellent work, 'There are no guarantees'<br /><br />Still almost of us have ways in which we can improve our own lives.<br /><br />I would only add from my own point- of- view that were I to write my own personal ' self- help work' it would have to include the religious dimension in a more prominent way.<br /><br />The greatest help of all is in being in real relation to God.	2005-06-24

In this outstanding work of investigative journalism Kenneth Timmermann speaks with a wide variety of privileged sources, including former Iranian intelligence agents, members of the families of present high- ranking Iranian officials,and a wide range of Defense experts and  provides  a frightening picture of the growing danger Iran presents to the world.<br /><br />Iran for twenty years lied to the world about its clandestine nuclear program . Though it is now playing a certain game with the IAEA over its uranium enrichment program Timmerman claims that Iran has already in effect become a nuclear power.<br /><br />The role of Iran in funding terror worldwide, and in sending surrogates to do its dirty work was well - documented by others in prior work. But Timmerman provides new information on Iran's connections with Al Quaeda, and with Bin- Laden. And he raises the clear possibility that this is where the world's chief- terrorist is now being hidden.<br /><br />The threat Iran presents to world- oil supplies , and its strategy of dominating the situation in the Gulf is another important topic covered in the work.<br /><br />Timmerman is to be especially commended for emphasizing the Iranian mullahs fierce Anti- Americanism, their absolute determination to drive the United States from the Middle East. The calls for killing of Americans and for the destruction of Israel come every Friday from the mosques of Tehran. And they have been made by the major leaders of Iran.<br /><br />Timmerman argues that the United States must allocate a large sum of funds to supporting internal resistance groups in Iran.<br /><br />He argues that the majority of Iranians are young, over sixty percent under twenty , and that they are highly dissatisfied with the regime of the mullahs.<br /><br />Timmerman believes that the best method for dealing with Iran is through regime transformation.<br /><br />However there is a contrary opinion, which says that the regime of the mullahs has a firm hold on the country. The Iranian terror state is not about to fold up because the Voice of America beams a few popular songs into Tehran and Esfehan. For this contrary opinion the only way to stop Iran is through military means, which even proponents of this option find, ( as Timmerman does) extremely problematic.<br /><br />This book thus provides an excellent and even frightening description of the danger presented by Iran.

The fact however is that even with falling birthrates worldwide the world is going to add in the next twenty years over two billion people. And the real problem is that almost all this growth will be in the poorer areas of the world, those where it is least likely to be beneficial.<br /><br />This suggests that an ideal global population policy might be one which addresses the needs of and character of specific populations and geographic areas. In a sense Longman does this when he talks about the importance of boosting the birth- rate among America's secular liberal population. Here he is disturbed by the fact that the more religious and to his mind, fundamentalist segments of the population are those with the larger populations and those likely to eventually take over American life and culture.<br /><br />Here his recommended policy is to offer tax - incentives ( No social security taxes for parents with children under eighteen) to boost the birth- rate in this group.<br /><br />However given the relatively poor success of tax- incentive programs for boosting birth- rates throughout the world it is questionable whether this particular policy, or any pro- natal government policy can have much effect.<br /><br />But the real point is that Longman's recommendation here is based on a value- judgment of what the ideal shape and character of American society should be.<br /><br />In general it would seem that the world would be improved if its more educated and richer populations would increase their birth- rates, and the poorer and less educated diminish them.	2005-06-23

Books	5	19	41	N	N	A probability, an absurdity, an impossibility	The probability is that 'artificial intelligences' or 'machine- minds'will attain self- consciousness. This self- consciousness will not necessarily be ' the feeling of self- consciousness' but will be defined by having an operational feedback capacity. They will be able to survey their own performance in terms of their own goals, and adjust their operations accordingly. It seems to me that in this sense it is already possible to speak about ' self- conscious machines'.<br /><br />But it seems to me that there is a gap , an impossible gap between being ' self- conscious in this way' and becoming self- conscious as human beings are. And this because human beings are self- conscious as individual human beings. That is to say that there are two forms of uniqueness associated with ordinary human self- consciousness. The uniqueness of our being humanly self- conscious, and the uniqueness of each individual's being self- conscious as uniquely themselves.<br /><br />This suggests a point which it seems to me makes the whole Ray Kurzweil spiritual- machine business an absurdity, and non- starter. A human mind is far more than its states of consciousness or self- consciousness.  A person is far more than their states of mind , conscious or not. The idea that somehow a human being can be reduced to being a brain, or states of the brain, or processes of the brain is in absolute contradiction with our own felt experience of life and the world. And that felt experience of life and the world is precisely that which would have to be ' transferred' to some kind of 'machine' if one  were to make the human into the spiritual machine .<br /><br /> And this touches upon a point frequently made by others in philosophically objecting to Kurzweil. Humans are bodily beings. We cannot be ourselves without sensing our bodies- our minds are all the time in constant readjustment in relation to our bodies, as our bodies in relation to our minds.<br /><br />What does a spiritual machine which has downloaded Ray Kurzweil 's mind see when it looks in the mirror?<br /><br />That absurdity leads to the impossibility.<br /><br />The impossibility of reducing human beings to some other kind of thing does not relate to whether or not that other kind of thing might be able to calculate faster, or even write greater symphonies than it.<br /><br />We are not just minds, but we are lives and stories. The very thought of reducing the ' human' in this way to some kind of ' replicable process' shows a certain dense indifference to the character, color and dream of human experience. It shows no sense of the complexity and mystery of human relationships.<br /><br />It shows no real feeling for the whole of what human life is, which again is something far more than simply the operations of our mind.<br /><br />So even should there emerge as a result of our efforts new kinds of ' beings' who have ' mental capacities beyond our own' this would not make them capable of wholly duplicating and replacing what we are.<br /><br />When Wordsworth wrote \\"To me the meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that are too deep for tears\\" he too was suggesting a kind of human perception in humility and modesty, which is wholly opposed in spirit, to the arrogance of those who would reduce us to their ' formulas' and replace us with a ' formula' which they believe 'more ' but in reality is far less than what we are.Kurzweil 's mind see when it looks in the mirror?  <br />That absurdity leads to the impossibility. <br />The impossibility of reducing human beings to some other kind of thing does not relate to whether or not that other kind of thing might be able to calculate faster, or even write greater symphonies than it.  <br />We are not just minds, but we are lives and stories.

The American - Jewish community is declining in numbers. It is an aging community, one with high- rates of intermarriage, and low rates of fertility. It is a community which is an increasingly small percentage of American society as a whole.<br /><br />Why is this important?<br /><br />I think that there are two answers, one for Jews and another for American non- Jews.<br /><br /> Jewish communities have thrived in various places in the world, and then disappeared. The American Jewry community is an especially important one for the Jewish people historically especially in its relation to Israel and the Jewish people as a whole.<br /><br />As for the second reason, I would maintain that for general American society the survival and thriving of an American- Jewish community is important because this community has made great contributions to American life in many different areas, and as on the whole been a great creative factor in the shaping of American civilization.<br /><br />In considering the situation of American Jews it is necessary  to understand that the challenges and character of American life are different from those that the Jews have known elsewhere. Only in America have Jews been given a kind of access and acceptance which in our own time means that there is virtually no discrimination against them. It is because America accepts the Jews, and adopts so much of what is Jewish as part of itself that assimilation happens so readily in the United States.<br /><br />Clearly to preserve its own tradition and way the Jews of America have to ( This is Dershowitz's major recommendation) greatly increase the quality and quantity of Jewish education. Sadly most American Jews are very ignorant about their own traditions. And one encouraging element in American - Jewish life is the intense return to Jewish learning by a certain minority of the population.<br /><br />Clearly learning to understand what the Jewish community and its history is , is central to preserving Jewish identity.<br /><br />Another point. Since the publication of Dershowitz's book there has been a dramatic increase in world-wide anti-Semitism. This often takes the form of Anti- Zionism and is directed primarily against Israel.<br /><br />American Jews have in the past played an important role in helping support the survival of Israel. Though support for Israel among the broad American public is relatively stable over the past forty years, and though there is massive Christian Evangelical support for Israel there is also now in the US a strong anti- Semitic, anti- Israel movement which combines Islamic fundamentalists, Palestinian Arab nationalists, those of the extreme right, and perhaps even more alarmingly , extreme left, politically.<br /><br />A strong American Jewish community is an important element in ensuring an Israel which can survive in the future.<br /><br />In this regard one additional element in strengthening Jewish young people's identity as Jews is through their traveling to and knowing Israel. The special 'Birthright' programs have attempted to do some of this.<br /><br />Dershowitz surveys the problem, and  shows his heart is in the right place.<br /><br />His book is in this sense highly  recommended. It should be supplemented however by the works of Jack Wertheimer, Sylvia Barack- Fishman, and others who consider this problem.is , is central to preserving Jewish identity. <br />Another point.

This study was compared with one on Romania with a government policy pushing to a higher- birth- rate had led to a  large increase in unwanted children, and years later higher crime rates.<br /><br />There are other findings regarding for instance the organizational similarities between the structure of criminal organizations, such as drug- trafficing operations and large retailers. The big guys at the top skim off everything, and the little guys all the way down through the heirarchy live on less than peanuts.<br /><br />My own sense is that surprising economic and sociological findings do provide here a great deal of human interest- but that they are not on the scale and of the level of  significance to be truly memorable.<br /><br />However what may be most memorable in the work is the whole concept of 'Freakonomics' itself which may become a household word, as much for instance as the famous concept of one of great fans of this work , the ' tipping point' of Malcolm Gladwell.	2005-06-21

Here the item in question is illegal building in the city of Jerusalem.<br /><br /> Justus Reid Weiner in this work makes a careful study of the whole building - situation in Jerusalem. He reveals that there is a massive illegal building going on in the Arab sector which the Municipality of Jerusalem , also for political reasons, dares not seriously impede. Over six- thousand illegal structures have been built by Palestinians in the past four years alone. Often this is on land which is formally owned by absentee landowers.<br /><br />This pattern of lawlessness in building has according to Weiner no justification in the Arab claim that they are deprived by the Israeli authorities of building permits. In fact thirty- six thousand such permits were issued in this time.<br /><br />The massive disordered sprawl which such illegal building creates is only one side of the problem. Weiner also shows how much of the building is politically motivated an effort of the Palestinian Authority to seize territory . Much of the building too Weiner shows is done by criminal elements within the Palestinian community.<br /><br />This illuminating work puts in true perspective a much misunderstood problem.	2005-06-20

It is the only country in the world whose very existence is challenged by some of its neighbors. It is the only country in the world that has fought five major wars in the past fifty- seven years simply to preserve itself against efforts at its destruction.<br /><br />This situation of threat is not about to go away. One major source of hostility to Israel is Islamic Fundamentalistism.  The potential adversaries of Israel are likely to continue working for its undermining even should their be formal peace between them. Egypt for instance has been formally at peace with Israel for close to thirty years. Nonetheless the media of Egypt is one of the most insistently anti- Semitic in the world, frequently calling for Israel's destruction.<br /><br />The present effort of the Bush Administration to push toward a Palestinian Arab state in part of the Holy Land also brings with it little promise of eliminating the Arab effort at Israel's destruction. The major theme of Palestinian politics whether enunciated by Fatah, or Islamic Jihad or Hamas is antagonism to Israel.<br /><br />In this situation of threat and insecurity four responsible Israeli public figures have set forth here what they regard as the borders that Israel can live with . Their claim is that unless Israel has clearly defined borders no real progress can be made toward bringing it to true security .<br /><br />These borders have to be such as to give Israel a reasonable amount of time to counter a surprise- attack of Arab armies. They have to be so clearly drawn as to prevent infiltration of Palestinians from the other side of the border.<br /><br />The case made here for reasonable and secure borders for Israel is a strong one.<br /><br />This document should be read by everyone concerned with understanding the minimal conditions for establishing a secure Israel, and a more peaceful Middle East.	2005-06-20

Her major point is that the great variety of choices we now have in many areas of life, increase our freedom and happiness. In the course of arguing in this way she makes an implicit argument for the intelligence and reason of most people. They will not spend years worrying about a choice in any area which means nothing to them. They will not spend years choosing a new product when they already have one in this particular line that suits them.<br />Still despite Postrel strong arguments(And there are others)it is clear that Barry Schwartz has  touched upon a central and important theme of human life in our time. The excess of choices and options within an area and between areas mean that we are often left confused and disturbed.<br />Here however I think that there is another point that Postrel makes which Schwartz is also aware of i.e. that being experienced in a particular realm teaches us how to cut out whole areas which otherwise would have disturbed us. I think a very good example for myself is in dealing with the Internet where it is possible to chase for hours one kind of misleading path to no- solution of the problem. With experience comes a knowledge of areas of interest, of sites that can be relied on, on how to use our time wisely.<br />However it does seem to me that there is a major cultural point about the nature of humanity, which is given in this world of superabundanct choice. I may be wrong but it seems to me that most people today are more scattered, more disordered and less able to really concentrate for long hours on one task. That is to say the whole background of our lives is endless distractions which make it difficult for us to shut ourselves off, and concentrate for the best type of work.<br />This is a thought- provoking work . I have unfortunately touched upon only a small number of the problems and choices in thought it raises.	2005-06-19

His monumental translation of the Gemara into Hebrew and then English and French has been a fundamental tool in spreading the learning of Torah. His teaching of Torah, and outreach work have made a major contribution to the Jewish world of learning in our time.<br /><br />In this book Rabbi Steinsaltz makes the admirable effort of attempting to assay the Jewish situation and reality. He tries to define who the Jewish people are through essays  in  collective psychology and sociology.  He writes about specific characteristics of the Jews , about the ability to assimilate, about the infighting which has prevented Jewish unity, about the notorious difficulty of defining a group which is neither a nation or a religion or a an ethnic group solely. He also writes about stereotypical views of the Jews in regard to Money, about the Jewish Messianic complex, about Jews being excessively Warm or Cold emotionally,  about the tendency of the Jews to Idolatry, about our role in the world, about the idea of unification and how it has effected great Jewish thinkers, and finally ` about what will become of the Jewish people'.<br /><br />The work also contains questions at the end of each chapter asked by Steinsaltz's faithful student and long- time editor Arthur Kurzweil.  These questions aim to refine and sharpen some of the major points made in the text.<br /><br />With all my great respect for Rabbi Steinsaltz, and with all my understanding that his aim is only to help the Jewish people better serve God, I found myself deeply disappointed with this work. For one thing Rabbi Steinsaltz writes of the Jewish condition almost as if the State of Israel had not existed for the past fifty- seven years, and is not a growing and central part of Jewish history and the Jewish people. Secondly, I was dismayed at the lack of factual matter involving the actual transformations in the Jewish situation which have taken place in the past twenty or thirty years. For example Rabbi Steinsaltz writes at great length about the importance of understanding the Jewish people as a family. There are great insights in his writing on this subject. However the Jewish family today in America is often a family with non- Jewish members inside it. It is not the traditional, historical Jewish family. The degree of intermarriage and assimilation occurring among the Jewish people are a central element in any assessment of our situation now. I would have expected Rabbi Steinsaltz to address this, and  provide suggested ways for the Jewish people to act now. After all, the book says it is going to address the Jewish situation and tell us what we are to do.<br /><br />I was deeply dismayed that the worldwide Anti- Semitic attack on the state of Israel is not considered in the book. The survival of Israel is , in my judgment anyway, the most important item on the Jewish agenda. To write so much about Jewish history and character without writing even one word about the longing for Zion, the longing for Redemption, the miraculous ingathering of Exiles is to deprive Jewish history of its heart. It is all well and good to talk about Jewish Messianism way up in the air but for the people of Israel the Messiah has always been connected with the return to Jewish sovereignty in the land of Israel. How could Rabbi Steinsaltz not consider this, not take into account in doing so , the thought of Rabbi Abraham Yitzhak Ha- Kohen Kook Z\\"ts\\"l. Rabbi Kook's idea of return to the land as connecting with worldwide redemption is  a central strand of Jewish thinking and action today in Israel.<br /><br />It seems to me that anyone who wishes to write a true and realistic work about the situation of the Jews today has to confront the very difficult realities the Jewish people are facing. These are in one sense demographic realities, relating to an aging, assimilating Diaspora. They are existensial problems relating to the efforts to destroy the Jewish character of the state of Israel. Rabbi Steinsaltz in this work does not even mention the divisions within Israeli political life, the fact that so many Jews have in some way turned against their own people. In this regard I would think that any `psycho-social analysis' of Jewish collective character would certainly make much more of the theme of ` betrayal' than Rabbi Steinsaltz has done.<br /><br />Nonetheless for me the greatest omissions come from the other side. Nothing is said about those Jews who miraculously came and transformed a land of desert into a modern society. Nothing is said about the revival of Hebrew as a spoken language. Nothing is said about the heroic struggles of generations of Jewish soldiers who fought and fight to ensure Jewish survival in a very hostile environment. Rabbi Steinsaltz's total ignoring of these kinds of Jews makes his overall assessment of the Jewish people and their character seriously flawed.<br /><br />We need today a Jewish thinker or thinkers who can really look at our situation, and strive to understand the directions we must take both for survival and for increased sanctity in serving God.<br /><br />We need to face the hard realities of our situation so that we can hopefully struggle for a better Jewish future.<br /><br />We need more books on this theme, and more relevant ones.orts to destroy the Jewish character of the state of Israel.

Stevens strangely seems to me less persuasive in personal communication than in impersonally seeing and saying a universe.<br /><br />The greatness of the poems is unquestionable. Part of it is their richness in perception, and the power in which perceptions and ideas combine in visionary lines of extended beauty. Another part is in the music of the poetry, a memorable music which plays in mind and heart and moves us into new feelings of things.<br /><br />Art in Stevens , the poetry of Art is an incantation and a vision, a kind of replacement religion .What is remarkable is how much Beauty he created without , it seems to me, any complementary idea of Goodness.<br /><br />With Stevens as with the poet I find him closest to, Keats,<br /><br />\\" Beauty is Truth, and Truth is Beauty\\" This may not be all we need to know on earth, but in this case it may well be  enough.	2005-06-17

In its early years many people were astounded at how a small beseiged nation could somehow manage to provide irrigation experts to distant countries in Africa and help them develop their own economies.<br /><br />In this remarkable work many of the most recent contributions of Israel to the world's technological and scientific development are depicted. Many of these innovations are in the all important realm of medical technology whose human benefit is unquestionable.<br /><br />The contributions of Israel to world development are significant not because they are all out of proportion to Israel's size, geographically and demographically. They are significant because this helping of others is a true religious meaning of what the Jewish state is supposed to be.

It is a book not simply about a baseball player, but about a brave, modest heroic human being, a dedicated, hard- working ball - player whose love of the game led him to set the astounding, once thought unbreakable record of playing in 2130 consecutive games.<br /><br />Gehrig was an athlete of another time, who for years was paid less than he was worth because he feared he might antagonize management and lose his job. His whole story including that of putting himself through Columbia and while there helping his mother wash dishes to support their family exemplifies this kind of modesty and dedication. Eig tells the story of his sudden illness with crippling multiple sclerosis ( Lou Gehrig's disease) and how he struggled with such great fortitude to maintain the most he could of his skills for as long as he could. He also tells of Gehrig's family relationships, his closeness to his mother, his marrying relatively late to a wife more capable of handling his business interests than he was himself. He tells of the odd friendship and great contrast between Gehrig and the Babe. He gives a spellbinding account of the famous ' Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth' speech.<br /><br />This is a work that every single reviewer on Amazon has highly praised.  It cannot be more highly recommended.	2005-06-15

The play was directed by Leah Stoller, and featured David Glickman, Gail Kirschner, Marvin Meital,and Arthur J. Fischer. The performance was excellent and Fischer was especially convincing as the policeman brother Victor Franz who sacrificed the education and career he might have had to care for his father and his own family.<br /><br />The play tells the story of the selling off of the family furniture sixteen years after the pater familias has died. The policeman brother and his wife open the play speaking about their own life, its disappointments, their lack of money and status. Soon after they are joined by the appraiser Solomon a ninety year old Yiddish accented fighter for life who throughout the play laments the loss of his daughter. They speak about the 'price' which the appraiser will give for the old furniture. Later when they are joined by the second brother, the successful surgeon who ran away from family responsibility to make a career and who has a broken and difficult family of his own, they begin to speak about the real ' price' .And this is the price which is paid for making the decisions we make in life, choosing the path we choose, making or not making the sacrifices we make. One brother has chosen the path of family loyalty and sacrificed career and prestige. The second chose the opposite. The first resents this and in the second part of the play voices this resentment, as his brother tries to rationalize and justify his failure to truly help the family when they needed it.<br /><br />Their dialogue is made in a simple colloquial language but as with the other work of Miller, this simple speech often contains profound reflections on life and its meaning.<br /><br />And as a whole the work is sustained by this sense that it , as the life it depicts , is really about ' something'. It is not about nonsense and post- post- post disintegrations into fictional absurdities.<br /><br />The play has a particularly strong closing , ironic and moving at once which I will not give away. My sense is that this closing must be ' seen and heard' and not just read if it is to be most effective.<br /><br />Miller is a writer of our everyday life and dreams, of the most American kinds of struggles, disappointments and confusions.<br /><br />He is also in the end a writer about life which truly ' means' something to those who live it.<br /><br />This may not be his greatest work, but it is certainly a fine and memorable one.ities.  <br />The play has a particularly strong closing , ironic and moving at once which I will not give away.

To my mind this book is about the most important subject mankind has on its agenda , that subject is the very nature of humanity itself, what it is , and what we should strive to make it to be. Because of the remarkable developments in several different areas of scientific and technological research Mankind is now facing kinds of decisions that it has never faced before. In this present work Joel Garreau talks to a wide variety of key researchers and thinkers and tries to understand the shape the human future might take, or rather be made into. He proposes a number of different scenarios, one called Heaven involves enhanced, 'perfect' human beings living forever in perpetual happiness. The second called Hell involves one or many of the Technologies getting out of hand, and Mankind perhaps through creation of hungry little nanobeings being eaten up by one of its own laboratory productions. The third scenario which Garreau calls ' prevailing ' involves Mankind somehow contending with both positives and negatives and emerging strengthened if transformed in incredible ways, and going on the development of its history and interaction with the Cosmos.<br />It is important to note that Garreau is not predicting anything with certainty , telling us in Hegelian, Marxian or any other ideological terms what the future and Mankind must be . He very much gives a sense of an incredible mix of alternatives whose outcomes are uncertain. He does however suggest a principle that whatever can happen will happen, and that the future will somehow contain a mix of all the alternatives taken together.<br />My own feeling is at the moment anyway slightly less than euphoric. It is not simply that the nuclear nonproliferation treaty is as I write this about to be broken open by North Korea and Iran's going openly nuclear. It is not simply that is that we are to face a greater danger from nuclear disaster than we faced even at the time of the cold war, when there were only two sides. That is one element. The development of a fanatic radical Islam whose religion is totalitarian closed- minded terrorism and whose aim is to dominate the world, is another major human development not considered in this book. Another one as another Amazon reviewer has pointed out is the rapidly accelerating fossil fuel crisis facing mankind as a whole, and the widening poverty- gap given by globalization. In other words these radical technological developments are occurring in a world in which there is increasing geopolitical chaos.<br />The ' old mankind' is in this very much alive , and ready I am sure to make use of whatever destructive technologies ' the new mankind' can provide to possibly enslave us all.<br />Genetics, robotics, information technology, nanotechnology ,all these are that is, not developing in a vacuum. And mankind which is in such great disorder now may go into ' the next phase of its evolution ' dragging along with it a mass of people who will make the transition to a brave new world of lesser significance.<br />All this is to say that when Ray Kurzweil's mind becomes a computer chip and an immortal machine the rest of us may still be suffering from various physical and nervous disorders including the Depression which so many researchers say is increasing dramatically in our own time. It appears that the more perfect the future becomes for a few of us, the worse it is for many of the rest.<br />I very much want to read this book more deeply as I know there is a great deal of information , and perspective I have missed.<br />I must admit however , that I have a certain skeptical relation to promises of perfect futures , especially when I have such a strong sense not only of the conflicts between good and evil, but between ideal ends and ' human goods ' themselves.<br />In other words whatever will be ten or twenty or fifty or five hundred years from now we must hope that the ' ruling creatures' of this earth and surrounding regions use their own God - given freedom and power of decision to enhance truth , goodness and beauty , eternal values.<br />Whether that is possible, whether what I am saying even makes sense or will make sense , I can't be sure.<br />For now anyway I am going off to ' davven Minchah' ( pray the afternoon prayer of Judaism) i.e. Whatever our condition and however we push our own power I believe that we will still need the appeal to a Transcendent Power to make our lives ultimately meaningful and fulfilling.decision to enhance truth , goodness and beauty , eternal values.

Whereas many faiths actively proselytize Judaism's traditional posture has been to discourage converts. In this work Lawrence J. Epstein provides a very useful guidebook for those who would nonetheless persevere in the effort.<br /><br />He provides important historical information and background in regard to conversion. He discusses the subject in general including the reasons why people convert. He provides personal stories as examples. He looks at the Conversion process from the point- of - view of the major Jewish religious denominations. He  answers questions potential converts are most likely to have.<br /><br />This work which was initially published in 1994 at Jason Aronson under the supervision of the person who contributed more than any other in the past half- century to the publication of English- language Judaica, Arthur Kurzweil is even more vital today than it was then. For the numbers of those who are potential candidates for conversion has increased.Also given the demographic crisis the Jewish people is presently facing a number of important figures, including Epstein himself are calling for the changing of general policy on Conversion in order to facilitate the process.<br /><br />A highly valuable and much recommeded work.	2005-06-14

In her work on 'Shemot ' as with her work on all of the Chumash ( The Five Books of Moses) she provides a series of alternative readings to a number (not all) of the questions raised by traditional Biblical commentators. She quotes some of their opinions, and she provides guiding questions for the reader.<br /><br />Her aim is not to provide the reader with fixed and definite final answers, to simply ' supply knowledge' but rather to involve the reader in creative wrestling, struggling to understand the text.<br /><br />She wants the reader to be an active participant in striving to understand the meaning of the text.<br /><br />For many she has been the supreme teacher in inspiring to love of the Biblical text, and its reading and rereading.	2005-06-12

Simcha Raz is one of the great Jewish storytellers of our time. He was a pupil of Reb Aryeh Levin and wrote this work telling his life story. Reb Aryeh was a true Tzaddik whose deeds of kindness in the Old Yishuv of Jerusalem were legendary then, and have remained legendary in the minds and hearts of subsequent generations. Reb Aryeh was in the close circle of Rav Kook, was the Rav of the Jewish prisoners fighting for independence at the time of the Mandate. But his deeds of kindness, his sacrifice for others go well beyond the expectations even of , if there can be such a thing an ' ordinary' holy person.<br /><br />This is an extraordinary book .

And this despite its marking the central event of the receiving of the Torah by the people of Israel.<br /><br />In the 'Jewish Publication Society' anthologies put out for Shabbat ( done by Rabbi Abraham Milgram) and the holiday anthologies ( by Philip Goodman) there is ordinarily an outstanding collection of texts.

They provide legend and song.<br /><br />These anthologies are of great value especially for those who have little knowledge of the holidays. Hopefully reading and understanding them can be a bridge to further inquiry and observance.<br /><br />I might also add, that even for one who does have some knowledge they will provide new texts, and a chance to celebrate in learning.

He elucidates the work of an important Jewish Hasidic thinker, one whose Torah is very much a teaching of the love of Torah. For the Sefat Emet the Torah is the unlimited wisdom of G-d that we can only imperfectly grasp.  We human beings are half of our real selves, and the other half which is with G-d comes down to us on Shabbos, but also comes to make us whole whenever we learn Torah.  <br />I hope this Shavuot to look into this particular Sefer more.

The sheer amount of information is so great, the entries so various in subject that endless delight is to be found in learning more and more. There are however as with most things, a few problems and limitations.<br /><br />Take for instance the opening entry of the Encyclopedia, the entry on 'Aaron'. We truly learn important things about Moses' brother and mouthpiece. But for anyone who knows Biblical literature not to speak of its commentaries, the entry is a shortcut of shortcuts. And thus misleading. For it does not tell of Aaron's role as leader of the Temple ceremony worship, does not explain his connection with Moses in a deep way, nor even mention their sister Miriam, does not tell of the death of Aaron's son in offering up strange fire, does not tell anything about Aaron's role as ' man of peace beloved by the people'. One of the great farewell scenes of world- literature Aaron's climbing to the top of Har Ha-Hor is not mentioned.<br /><br />I take this one example to indicate another simple truth. An encylopedia of this kind is always best on a subject one does not really know much about. Then anything we are told , adds to our knowledge if not necesarily our understanding.<br /><br />In checking out a number of articles I did not find ' inaccuracy' here. In confronting other subjects I knew nothing about I did have a sense that I was getting reliable information.<br /><br />This is again a good tool and source for attaining first knowledge of a subject.<br /><br />However if one really wants to know and understand the meaning of a particular subject my recommendation would be to supplement this work with other sources of information.	2005-06-07

It provides information about the characters of the work, the settings of the work. It can be truly helpful in ' straightening out' some of the confusion we often have after reading a book- no matter how much we have loved and concentrated in it.<br /><br />It seems to me that this book is especially geared to helping students who are taking courses on these particular books. But it can also I think help in another way, help the reader get certain things ' straight' before doing the real reading on their own.<br /><br />And this is the other, perhaps obvious point. No summary of a work is the work itself. And no information given about the work can substitute for the experience of reading the work.<br /><br />Many clever students will of course substitute these summaries for the reading, write their papers and take their tests succcessfully.

Lappen. They point out the books faults and bias in many different areas. However I would like to very briefly point out simple basic mistakes made in the two editorial reviews of this book one by Amazon Com. and one by Publishers Weekly. The Amazon Com. review says that the Israelis and the Palestinians struggled over this land for hundreds of years. The fact is that the Jewish connection to the Land of Israel goes back over three- thousand years. As for what are today called the Palestinian Arabs, they did not exist even as much as one hundred years ago. The various Arab clans and communities a good share of which entered the land from Egypt when there began large- scale Jewish return to the land, did not have a conscious national identity. That Palestinian Arab identity came only in reaction to Zionism, and the presence of the Jews in the land.<br /><br />Another amazingly false claim perhaps taken from Segev's ' stretchers' is that the Palestinian Arabs have shown a greater inclination toward peace than the Jews. The fact is that five times in the past seventy years the Arabs have been offered a state in a part of the land and have refused it. Even when they were offered the great share of the land they refused to live in peace with a much smaller Jewish state.<br /><br />One more word about Segev's cover- up of British hostility towards the Jews, his omitting major events in history such as the White Paper prohibiting Jewish immigration at a time the Jews of Europe had nowhere to go. This cover- up by Segev is fairly characteristic of his work as a whole.<br /><br />An Israeli patriot he certainly is not. Perhaps what is worse is that he is not a fair and objective reporter.	2005-06-06

In his anthology 'Blood to Remember: American Poets remember the Holocaust' he did a monumental job of collecting and truly listening to the widest possible range of poets reflecting upon what is arguably the most horrible event in human history.<br /><br />For some four decades now he has contributed first - rate poetry to almost every poetic journal of distinction one can think of. In this present volume he makes a long journey , a journey in memory back to the world of his childhood and the people he loved there.<br /><br />Fishman is a rarity in a way , a poet whose genuine respect and love for the people in his life pervade his poetry. His sympathy for his parents in these poems is tremendous, and so many of the poems move deeply in that one feels him holding on still now to those long lost, and yet still with him. In one of my favorites of this collection ' My Father on a Sled Smoking ' he sees his father fifty years ago smoking himself to death then, and then shifts and sees him in his true final moments.<br /><br />'Pitch the fresh pack/hidden in your jacket into the glitter of ice/and snow. Take off your cap and let it go./ Breathe in the sweet chill of this undreamnt of/ moment when life offers you a choice. Father:/ listen to my voice that calls out to you/ across the snow- bound void: you will swerve/at the last jolting second, and death's branches/ wil scar you face but, five decades later,/ you will sit ,knees wrapped in a white wool blanket/ a dear scared frail old man, dozing to Frank Sinatra / and almost at peace as sleep drags you down.'<br /><br />Many of the best poems of this collection are about the poet's father whose gift for happiness and appreciation of the beauty in life seems to have been bequeathed to his son. But his love for his mother is also apparent in these poems. In one chilling one he tells of her coming close to death, her recovery from bone cancer. 'When I learn that you will live/ that life flows back into each cell/ each bone and when you tell me.My heart/ is set on dancing. Ten thousand sunsets shift from black/ to rose. Words hold me again in their sweet/ and fiery embrace.'<br /><br />Fishman tells too in these poems of his poetic vocation , of his slow learning of the love of words, and of how words are from him a life- giving reality, a source of endless play and meaning.<br /><br />Who reads these poems will read a man, a very good man, a man reflecting on his family and his life as a poet, and on the world which he makes more beautiful and more memorable with his words.<br /><br />These poems are a special gift to those who love words and life and poetry.When I learn that you will live/ that life flows back into each cell/ each bone and when you tell me.My heart/ is set on dancing.

She may have really had Vietnam in mind from the beginning, and gone back and selected her examples in order to make the final and for her purpose, major chapter of folly,more convincing- but she hit upon something so true that it almost cries out to heaven at not being mentioned more often. Governments do very often act in total contradiction to their own best interest, and to the best interest of the people they are meant to serve.<br />Tuchman writes of ancient Troy, and the Papal See during the Renaissance, of the British Monarchy in its folly in relation to the Colonies during the American Revolutionary War.

The ' terror' that came afterwards and is with us today is a result of that Oslo folly. And now a different Israeli government is thinking of another act of stupidity, a one- sided withdrawal which will give still more power and proximity to its enemies.<br />Tuchman in the studies she does here, uses certain criteria. The folly must be a present policy of a government, that people in that time do understand as folly. There must be alternatives to it. And the folly must be the action not of one eccentric individual but of a government of a counsel of men.<br />One question that might be asked is: Given the fact that human beings have freedom, and power of decision it would seem 'folly' or 'mistaken self- defeating policy' is an inherent option in Governmental policy.<br />It would be interesting to have studies which try to show ' wise government decisions' , studies too which try to see the factors which make for ' wise policy' and those which tend to lead to 'folly'.<br />In the one case I know best that not included in this book, the folly involved in Israel's arming and ceding territory to its enemies it seems to me that there are many factors involved: One central one however is the longing for peace, the tiredness of war on the part of the Israeli people. There is no good option, no real chance for peace, so the Government instead of taking the hard, best option chooses something which seems to give an immediate reward but in fact turns out to be a nightmare.<br />In this the 'opposite of folly' is a kind of courageous confrontation of reality, a kind of strength in will despite promise of further adversity.<br />Let us pray that the democratic countries of the world will have the strength not to be too foolish again. ( At present US folly is in my opinion displayed in its unconditional support of Saudi Arabia as Saudi Arabia sends terrorists into Iraq, funds the worldwide terror network, runs the world's slavetrade, teaches fierce anti- Americanism in its schools, exports this kind of Wahhabism throughout the world, including in thirteen- hundred mosques within the United States.<br />If the enemy is at the gate, there is no reason to open it wide and let him in.tend to lead to 'folly'.

The most moving part of the interview was a poem which he read to Smith, a poem written for his wife who died two years ago at the age of ninety- three.<br /><br />He read the poem to Smith, and she comments in the middle.<br /><br />Summer is late, my heart.<br /><br />Words plucked out of the air<br /><br />some forty years ago<br /><br />when I was wild with love.<br /><br />He came to the poem's haunting conclusion:<br /><br />Darling, do you remember<br /><br />the man you married?

It is written by someone who is able to understand the mathematical challenges and achievements of Nash's work in a way which I do not.<br /><br />On other levels though, and there are many there is a great deal which I believe the ordinary reader can understand and learn from. Of course the main thing here is the story of the life of one extraordinary , if not particularly ethically admirable person. A story of genius, of great creative achievement, and of schizophrenic illness .Also a story of a heroic remission in which Nash claims to have learned how to stop himself from going into the world of paranoid delusion. The Nobel Prize and the recognition which come after Nash has gone through so much suffering seem a ' storybook' ending. And this though the storybook ending is somewhat upset by Nash's problematic relations to his own children, one who suffers an illness similar to his own, and the second who Nash seems to want to unfairly compare to himself.<br /><br />For me one of the most interesting parts of the work was the glimpse into the world of mathematical creativity. I am used to think of ' competition in creation ' as nonsense. Hemingways's famous boast of having licked old Turgenev but not having taken on yet old Tolstoy( I paraphrase here with the names wrong) always struck me as ridiculous. I have always thought that in Literature anyway, each person is alone with what they create, and their voice and story and creation in the end is what it is, regardless of comparisons , and without relevance of competition.<br /><br />But in the mathemtical realm as I see here there is fierce competition, especially around the solving of certain problems which have historically baffled great mathematicians in the past. One key point in Nash's breakdown was apparently was when a young Italian mathematician solved before him a problem he was on his way to getting the answer to. In this context I also learned that for Mathematicians there is a prize called ' The Field Prize' which for them is the supreme one. And one can only get this when one is under thirty. Nash raced and did not make it, and this was a source apparently of tremendous anguish to him.<br /><br />Aside from fierce competitiveness however there are other qualities which the mind of Nash excelled in. According to Nasar Nash was a ' long- distance runner ' who stayed with a problem for years , thinking and thinking. Secondly , of course like almost all of his mathematician colleagues he was in some deep way a loner, alone in his own mind. A good part of the book in this regard records Nash's social awkwardness, his inability to somehow connect especially when very young, with others. Paradoxically, and this is one of the more uplifting elements in the work many of his colleagues were generous helpful and understanding of him. Along with the competitiveness, the tremendous determination, the ' brilliance' Nash had an ability and will to tackle the most difficult kind of problems. He had an extraordinary kind of confidence- arrogance. Perhaps part of this came from his childhood education with his father and him tackled together certain kinds of technical and electrical engineering problems. But in any case Nash had a certain supreme kind of faith in his own ability. This had its unpleasant side in his tormenting often lesser mortals, even mathematical colleagues, and too the members of his own family , as being ' inferiors'.<br /><br />The book is also very interesting because it touches upon the great centers of mathematical creativity , great geniuses like Von Neuman , and even Einstein. It gives a real sense of what the worlds of these kind of extrarordinary minds are about.<br /><br />Nash was with everything else, and the descriptions of his paranoid schizophrenia do raise the question of how his ' breakdown kind of mind' related to his ' super-functioning mind', a recognized ' star' even in these worlds. He worked in a number of different realms, and perhaps somewhat disappointingly for himself his most recognized contribution is in the area of ' equilibrium theory' which has applications in economics, sociology, other areas outside of pure mathematics.<br /><br />I believe any and every biography( No matter how competent the writer) raises for the reader questions that the writer has not fully answered in the work. But I believe on the whole this work is written with a sound kind of balance and tastefulness, covering very painful and difficult subjects with tact and understanding.<br /><br />All of us I think wonder at , and are in a little awe of those kinds of minds which seem so far beyond our own that we can never really grasp them. Sometimes such minds as with Newton also , seem too to exist along with another mind lost in insane calculations of no real value.<br /><br />This book tells the story of one such beautiful and disturbed mind , the mind of John Forbes Nash.in a number of different realms, and perhaps somewhat disappointingly for himself his most recognized contribution is in the area of ' equilibrium theory' which has applications in economics, sociology, other areas outside of pure mathematics.  <br />I believe any and every biography( No matter how competent the writer) raises for the reader questions that the writer has not fully answered in the work.

I would only add one point about the character and nature of 'The Tzaddik'in general.<br /><br />The whole Hasidic movement came into being at a time when the Jewish people were poor and suffering, and in need of spiritual guidance and help. Their leaders deep in study were remote. The Baal Shem Tov came into the world and taught love of the common people. The Tzaddik who became their leader , the new kind of ideal Rabbi and Teacher was one who valued the common people and taught them at their own level. The teaching became a teaching of story and song and parable also. And the great Tzaddikim became the true advocates of the people , the common people in every way.<br /><br />Of course there was a later development in terms of huge courts being built up, and other elements entering.<br /><br />This particular work is a study of one Tzaddik , Yaakov Yosef of Polnoye a disciple of the Baal Shem Tov. Rabbi Dresner writes with learning and sympathy and illuminates not only a life, but also a world, the world of early Hasidism.	2005-06-03

I must have read close to twenty Nabakov books during that period.<br /><br />This was for me one of the most confusing. And I could not make much sense of the story, if there was one, or what exactly was supposed to be going on. I nonetheless could appreciate as is the case in all of Nabakov's writing that power of poetic perception that could suddenly in the middle of a vague paragragh chill the mind with a sentence of  fresh cold strikingly precise beauty.<br /><br />A number of the reviewers on Amazon have written explanations of what the book is about . 1) The history of Russian literature retold here 2) The life of emigre Nabakov in Berlin as he is about to say farewell to writing in Russian 3) The story of grief for the lost father( Nabakov's own father was assassinated) . 4) The groping false starts of the young writer, and deceptions and lures of the literary emigre world 5) The gift itself which I suppose is a gift of Russian Literature to the world, and which Nabakov would certainly contribute his share.<br /><br />I found this book long, hard to understand but as always with Nabakov not without its great consoling pleasures.<br /><br />What a writer, what a gift to the world of Literature.	2005-06-03

I also would thank Shalom for his reading of many of my reviews, and giving me the sense that in writing them I am not simply acting in vain.<br /><br />This work tells the story of one of the greatest of all Hasidic Rabbis, Rabbi Levi Yitzhak of Berditchev.<br /><br />The Berditchever is known as the great advocate and defender of the Jewish people. His path was a path of kindness and mercy, and seeing the good in people even where they were acting questionably.<br /><br />This book retells many of the most well- known stories of his great and often miraculous deeds of kindness.<br /><br />It also provides a basic history , tracing his story as he moved from Zholikov to Pinsk to Berditchev. It shows the difficulties he faced including those caused by the religious establishment which was opposed to Hasidism.  The Berditchever suffered much in his life including the loss of his beloved son Rebbe Meir.<br /><br />In one early incident in the book where he suffers at not being able to pray in a certain place Dresner writes of him,\\" He burst into tears and wept until he cried his heart out over the sorrow of the Divine Presence, and he fell in a faint. Then he saw the glory of God in all its splendor and heard the words: \\"Be strong, My son! Great suffering will come upon you, but have no fear for I shall be with you..\\"<br /><br />In all his wanderings in this world and through mystical visions in the next the Berditchever clung to God, and gave an example of the deepest devekut (adherence to God) and love of God.<br /><br />Dresner tells the story of this great lover of God and Israel very well.<br /><br />An inspiring work on one of the great teachers of the people of Israel.	2005-06-03

I am amazed to see that this book has not yet been reviewed by anyone on Amazon.<br /><br />The Iranian nuclear threat is arguably the greatest one now facing the U.S. and the world.<br /><br />And in fact Henry Sokolski has prepared another book on this threat in which he will claim that the efforts to stop Iran either militarily or by simply talking through the framework of the IAEA are futile.<br /><br />In any case the dangers to the world of Iran's going nuclear are very great.<br /><br />One is the breakdown of all proliferation agreements, the racing of neighboring states Saudia Arabia, Iraq, Egypt , Syria and Turkey to acquire nuclear weapons.<br /><br />Secondly the danger of an oil- market gone wild. Iran with nuclear weapons will have a tremendous new blackmail lever.<br /><br />It can block transit lanes, tie up the Straits of Hormuz  , blackmail the world.<br /><br />Thirdly, Iran is the largest exporter of terror in the world. With nuclear weapons its possibilities for doing damage, especially as it makes such skillful use of surrogates in carrying out terror attacks, increase enormously.<br /><br />As I understand it the authors of this book tend to believe that a military preempt on the part of the United States or Israel would be counterproductive. I do not know enough, and simply do not have the intelligence to be sure that they are right.<br /><br />But it seems to me given the very strong ideological anti- Western and anti-American base of the mullahs regime all the very clever tactical appeasing moves are not going to do very much.<br /><br />In addition Iran has China in its corner, and China is going to veto any formal UN action against it.So that even if US efforts at persuading Russia from helping Iran's nuclear program ( hithero unsuccessful) are successful, it will not fully deter Iran.<br /><br />This book  provides an important background to the issue. But there have been serious new developments since its publication( For instance,Iran's missile program has according to Tehran Times of June 1, 2005  taken a giant leap forward and its Shihab 3 missile now can be solid- fuel operated, meaning there is less chance of preempting it) and is therefore to some degree already dated.f June 1, 2005  taken a giant leap forward and its Shihab 3 missile now can be solid- fuel operated, meaning there is less chance of preempting it) and is therefore to some degree already dated.	2005-06-02

Why this happens and to whom exactly it happens whole Literatures, including my guess is the psychiatric and neuroscience literatures can give only partial answers to.

In this scholarly and informative work the President of the International Organization of Jewish Lawyers and Judges  Hadassa Ben-Itto traces the origin and development of the work. What began in the cellars of the nineteenth century Tsarist secret police became a favorite document of the Nazis, and today is spread throughout the world by the evil largesse of Saudi Arabia, and other Islamic groups including Hamas.<br /><br />In other words this work has been used at various times and places as a means for hating Jews and demanding their destruction.<br /><br />The Protocols main thesis that there is an international Jewish government planning to take over the world is absurd to anyone who knows the actual history of the Jews in the past two thousand years or even more. The Jews for those two thousand years were by and large a people scattered and persecuted, exiled and stateless. Nonetheless  the coming into being of the modern state of Israel, the ingathering of Jews from over a hundred nations  has not put an end to the slanderous uses of the Protocols.<br /><br />In this book Ben- Itto  presents the history of the creation of the Protocols - She describes the court trial in Bern in 1934 which exposed the  Protocols as falsification: She shows how the deliberately obscure style allows the advocates of this book to link any event to it, no matter what it is: Tzar's family murder or financial crisis.<br /><br />She shows how this forgery contributed to 1974 UN Resolution that declared Zionism to be one of the types of racism.

It does not content itself with looking at the royal family, but attempts to take a look at the Saudi people in all their complexity. Surprisingly what Bradley finds is not the stereotypical picture had in the West of a wholly submissive and subservient people who are pleased to be ruled by the House of Saud. In fact what Bradley finds is a people eager for a degree of freedom and autonomy, one which is oppressed by the royal family 's corruption .<br /><br />In an interview on FrontPage Com. in which he spoke about the book and the situation in Saudi Arabia Bradley said that what is needed now is a real effort to help democratic elements in Saudi Arabia come to the fore. He criticized the Bush Administration for caring only for oil supplies and short- term convenience, thus appeasing the Saudi ruling house, and not really being true to the Democratization of the Middle East program it itself has espoused.<br /><br />As Bradley a veteran Arabic speaking journalist who traveled throughout the kingdom in his research on this book, sees it the Saudi people suffer from a regime corrupt as the former Soviet one, a regime in which privilege and power are held by one huge clan suppressing millions of people.<br /><br />This work thus provides both a very detailed picture of the way people actually live in Saudi Arabia, and political prescriptions as to how to alleviate the situation of a disenfranchised and tyrannized majority.	2005-05-29

The Prayer of the Frist Fruits  Samuel and the Ark  Biblical Leadership Plato and Isaiah  Redemption( Isaiah and Deuteroro- Isaiah)  False Prophets ( Jeremiah 28)  Prophecy, Apocalyptic, and the Historical Hour  Job  The Heart Determines (Psalm 73)  Biblical Humanism.<br /><br />I will just cite one passage to give a bit of the flavor to this very deep and instructive work.<br /><br />In his essay on leadership he writes, \\" The biblical question of leadership is concerned with something greater than moral perfection. The biblical leaders are the foreshadowings of the dialogical  man , of the man who commits his whole being to God's dialogue with the world, and who stands firm throughout the dialogue. The life of those people .. is absorbed in this dialogue, whether the dialogue comes about through an intervention as in Abraham's talk with God about Sodom, or Moses after the sin of the Golden Calf: or whether it comes about through a resistance they offer against that which comes upon them and tries to overpower them.(as in Jeremiah and Moses)....... or whether the dialogue comes about through the struggle for a purpose and a task , as we know from that dialogue which took place between David and God. Whatever the way, man enters into the dialogue again and again; imperfect entry, but yet one that is not refused, an entry that is determined to persevere in the dialogical world. All that happens here is here experienced as dialogue; what befalls man is taken as a sign; what man tries to doand what miscarries is taken as an attempt and failure to answer, as a stammering attempt to respond as well as one can.ether it comes about through a resistance they offer against that which comes upon them and tries to overpower them.(as in Jeremiah and Moses)....... or whether the dialogue comes about through the struggle for a purpose and a task , as we know from that dialogue which took place between David and God.

It is translated by Ann Dunnigan and has an insightful afterword by Rufus W. Mathewson.<br /><br />I have been reading a lot of Chekhov lately, and have also written a number of reviews on his story collections. However I now have the sense that I have previously missed completely an important side of Chekhov, if not a very attractive one. I have previously tended to see Chekhov as an author who shows great sympathy and even love for his characters, whose careful description of their pains and sufferings comes out of his own strong identification with them.<br /><br />But here I sense something quite different . In the title story ' The Ward' Chekhov presents a picture of a small - town's insane asylum. He presents a picture of the aristocratic and lonely supervisor , Dr. Andrei Yefimych Ragin and of the various inmates .As is usually the case with Chekhov the descriptions of the characters are lively and moving, and give insight not only in regard to their physical presence, but their moral and spiritual state. In the course of this story we see much of the cruelty, irrationality and absurdity of the world. This is often the case in Chekhov's stories.<br /><br />There is also in this story the kind of intellectual dialogue  between the only two of its characters capable of this Ragin, and Ivan Dmitrich- a kind of dialogue that Russian literature so excels at. These dialogues illuminate character and provide metaphysical depth. In this particular story the main character comes to suffer a tremendous injustice, and in the end be confined to the very same asylum he once managed.<br /><br />The story like so many of Chekhov's story holds the reader , amuses the reader, gives the reader a glance at life and characters in a way never seen before.<br /><br />In other words there is another Chekhov classic well worth reading.<br /><br />My own problem is that in this work( rightly or wrongly, and importantly or not) I sensed not simply the cruelty of circumstance, fate and life , a cruelty so often the theme of Chekhov's work- I also sensed a certain cruelty in the author himself, in the voice of the story.<br /><br />Again this may not be important to other readers. For me however it is. For while it may not impinge upon Chekhov's literary greatness it does impinge upon my sense of his moral worthiness.<br /><br />And here I am made to think of how often in Russian literature characters go from one extreme to another, and how the most kind can become in an instant the most cruel.<br /><br />But again and most importantly for the reader. There are not so many great works, and not so many literary classics. 'Ward Six' is one of them.rightly or wrongly, and importantly or not) I sensed not simply the cruelty of circumstance, fate and life , a cruelty so often the theme of Chekhov's work- I also sensed a certain cruelty in the author himself, in the voice of the story.  <br />Again this may not be important to other readers.

It very often is the OPEC member that adds on to the oil supply , and so keeps the price down. It has huge holdings of US financial instruments. It has especially good personal connections with many of American leaders, among whom are the Bush family. It has been considered an ally of the United States since the time of President Franklin Roosevelt.<br />However Saudi Arabia is also the home of Wahabi Islam. This radical xenophobic form of Islam is the principal ideology of Islamic terrorism. Saudi Arabia 's school - system preaches violent anti- Americanism. Eleven of the fifteen terrorists of 9/11 were Saudis. The largest contingent of foreign terrorists operating against the Iraqi regime, and US forces in Iraq are Saudis. The Saudis through Islamic charitable organizations ( as Posner makes clear in this book) are major funders of terror in the world.<br />Thus the US- Saudi connection is an important, problematic, and questionable one.<br />Posner in this research adds  evidence regarding the negative role Saudi Arabia plays in the whole struggle against Terror, and in the US effort to push toward Democracy in the Middle East. He provides evidence showing how Saudi influence has penetrated and corrupted law-enforcement and political agencies in the United States.<br />This book even adds  the somewhat unlikely and not fully proved  story of the Saudis having in fear of a US invastion and takeover attempt  completely mining their oil- fields.<br />Aside from the questionable character of this story  Posner does present a well- documented picture of Saudi double- dealing toward the United States.<br />It too points out how the Saudi connection has prevented the US from going all out in the war on terror. For to do this the US would have to also confront and transform the Saudi regime itself.<br />Whoever reads this book and studies the present US- Saudi connection will leave it having considerable worries about the present course of US foreign policy, and in fact the future of Western democracy in an energy hungry world.<br />A vital work for understanding one of the great threats to American democracy today.se of US foreign policy, and in fact the future of Western democracy in an energy hungry world.

Only if you think exactly the way this narrow maniac thinks do you have a right to breathe on this earth.<br /><br />For presenting a detailed picture of the Bin- Laden ideology this book is commendable.<br /><br />As to the military- threat scenarios I think that after 9/11 there is not a sane person in the world who can say that ' great disaster' might not come again. It very well might. And there are an incredible number of directions and places from which it might come.<br /><br />I do not however think that it can come from suitcase nuclear weapons of the former Soviet Union. The fact is we know of no such device being operable. And as another writer on Amazon has rightly said the fact that it has not happened yet is strong evidence that it will not happen. And there is one clear reason for this. Terrorists tend to aim to do the maximum amount of destruction they are capable of at any given time. They do not delay. If they could have done it they probably would have done it.<br /><br />This again does not mean the West and the United States especially is not under greater threat than before. Since 9/ 11 there are many more Islamic terrorists in the world with one or another variant of a Bin- Laden like ideology.<br /><br />There are too it is well to remember other kinds of dangers, especially the WMD threats presented by nations like North Korea and Iran.<br /><br />It may well be that the  threats mentioned in this work are not the real and the dangerous ones. But again no one can know with certainty where the next Evil may come from.<br /><br />Whether the Intelligence services of the Western world will be ahead of the terrorists is not certain. Rather that is something to be worked for by them, and prayed for by the rest of us.	2005-05-25
229168:US	20595117	RBC2ZDJOHI2ZK	0880016078	874398137	The Essential Tales Of Chekhov	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Twenty of hundreds of stories	A quibble with the title of the volume. Why ' the essential Chekhov'? as if the great bulk of the Chekhov stories not contained in this volume were somehow 'less essential?'<br />One cannot help but agreeing with the overwhelming majority of readers and reviewers of Chekhov who find him one of the great masters and delights of Literature. His stories are celebrations of insight into the human soul and character, in all its great quirkiness. Here stories too are guides to understanding life's ironies and disappointments. Chekhov's work is filled with dreamers, and filled with obsessed characters whose ideas take them on lonely paths of their own . What makes Chekhov so special in my mind aside from this constant play and contradiction between reality and dream, is the love which he seems to have for his characters. The soul of the human being Chekhov is felt in these stories, almost as if he were a caring country physician seeking to understand and find a remedy for the strange illnesses of his beloved patients.Chekhov knows what romantic love is and of course one of his signature stories ( included here) \\"The Lady and the Dog\\" gives us a truly moving instance of it. Life and the heart lead us to where we do not necessarily want to go. The aging lecher despite himself finds himselfr impossibly in love with the Bovary-like heroine and upon their reunion in impossible love and life the story ends.<br />In Chekhov stories too as in life things end in the middle without resolution and with only the promise of disappointment and heartbreak to come.	2005-05-24

Such an anthology brings both great stories and serious analysis of the work together. This edition also contains some of Chekhov's memorable correspondance.<br /><br />After reading many Chekhov stories I think it is possible to venture a few generalizations about the essence of his art. First of all he is a great creator of human character, of idiosyncratic individuals. He too is a master of depicting the clash between the inner dream and longing of the individual and the cruel reality that he faces. The child Vanka who desperately writes letters to his grandfather in the hope of escaping a life of virtual slavery is a prominent example in this work. Chekhov is a writer with a great heart and great feeling for the inner emotions of his characters. And he creates in the reader a sympathy for those characters. Consider the story ' The Darling ' in which a woman's loving and caring and positive nature, a nature which totally supports and takes upon herself the husband or in the end the imagined step- child she cares for , persists through the various individuals who are part of her life. Chekhov is the writer who makes us feel the twilight poignance of life , the great heartbreak of human souls in longing and disappointment. So many of his characters are dreamers, longing for a reality which the crude tough world before them either ignores or violently contradicts. I think that in an age in which people talk about ' post- character literature' it is important to see how much of a great writer's greatness is in the creation of characters, vibrant human beings that the reader can identify with. Chekhov is also the great portrayer of human folly, and does this with irony and humor. Consider how in the story ' The Chameleon' the judge changes his verdict back and forth as he thinks first that the dog which has bitten the complaintant belongs to a highly important official, or does not. This judge changing his opinion to suit what will be good for himself is the perfect embodiment of human injustice and hypocrisy. The foibles and weaknesses of Chekhov's character are everywhere apparent, and yet so many of his characters are , excuse the word, ' lovable'. One feels that Chekhov is a great and generous and loving soul as a writer, and that his spirit pervades his literature.<br /><br />What a pleasure to be in the world of such a soul.rtant official, or does not.

Here he takes on the hardest problem of all, the injustices and cruelties of a world made by an omnipotent and omnibenevolent<br /><br />G-d. He tells the reader to imagine themselves building an ideal society and imagine how they would run it. All this as a way of making one central argument i.e. that had G-d run the world down to the last detail there would be no human freedom. And that therefore G'd-s hiding His Power is the very basis of the world we have. For only if there is a hidden God can man have the freedom to act.<br /><br />Kaplan indicates that it is through the free decisions of Mankind that it comes to such suffering and cruelty.<br /><br />Kaplan in the end gives the example of the holy Klausenberger Rebbe who lost his whole family in the Shoah, but afterwards remarried, founded a Hasidic sect and moved it to Israel.

Perhaps that is so, but my thought about the various Chekhov collections is that each one of them contains real treasures and each one gives a sense of the essence of Chekhov.<br /><br />So what I will do here is simply write a few of my thoughts on my recent reading of Chekhov in the hope that they may be of interest to a reader or two.<br /><br />The Chekhov stories are among the best I have ever read. One element in this is I sense a certain love and respect the author has for his characters even when he may be mocking them. Another element is Chekhov's ability to teach us how to see the character from inside. Chekhov writes with sympathy and insight of the inner lives of others. His work is filled with dreams and longings and disappointments and many great loves. He seems to delight in portraying idiosyncratic characters with great affection. His stories are famous for not ` telling stories' but that is not I think the case. Often his stories do contain within them the narrative of what the person has lived.<br /><br />As I do not know Russian I cannot fully appreciate the stories, or appreciate his special idiom.But they have a feeling of Russian lavishness, drunkenness, of Russian generosity. They also present the Russian world and Russian nature and have a kind of wild poetry in them .Chekhov sees people and things from inside and sympathetically and he gives the reader a sense of his affection for them. With Chekhov there is a sense of the controlling voice of the writer behind the story as a good person.<br /><br />Chekhov also is very strong on the theme of reality encountering dream, and knocking it on the head. While he does write of the inner lives of people with sympathy he seems to do it with a kind of scientific objectivity. There is something very convincing about the way his pictures are painted. His characters perhaps because they are Russians know how to go on and on . And often at the heart of the story is a brilliant monologue in which a soul and life are revealed.<br /><br />Chekhov too has a very strong sense of human foible and folly. There is much comedy and contradiction in his work. And there is a strong sense of his ` realism' in these depictions.<br /><br />What Chekhov says about life ultimately is difficult to say. Disappointment is the lot of many of his heroes, and illusion is their stock in trade. Dreaming drives so many of them. And many live by fixed ideas which even when they realize seem to mock at them. There is romantic love in Chekhov, great passion and there is too human tenderness and affection. But most of his heroes live crying out inside,while the world outside goes about its business.know how to go on and on .

Each of his characters is both described in physical and moral terms. But Chekhov in describing his characters gives us a strong sense that he is in touch with real life, with its difficulties, sufferings , complications and impossibilities. He also gives such a strong sense of the special quality of Russian life and society , of its values of its saints and its sinners.<br /><br />Some of the stories in this selection are heartbreaking, arouse in us a sense of wonder and compassion . The story ' Heartbreak' the story of a poor coach driver who has lost his son and wants to tell the story of this to someone. And who in the course of his work meets only selfishness, cruelty, indifference. And in the end finally pours out this story to his horse, because the horse at least stands still long enough to as it were listen.<br /><br />My cliche summary cannot do justice to the power of the story. In another of the stories a seemingly minor character begins to speak about the lunch the court officials he is working with might have. In the course of it he presents the whole world of Russian food , and does this with such humor and such colorfulness as to give a real feeling of joy to the reader. In what is arguably Chekhov's most famous story ,'The Lady with the Pet Dog' he not simply tells a story of romantic love he does so in a way in which we most deeply are made to feel the irony and beauty and pain of life.<br /><br />Chekhov is a writer deeply in touch with human beings, their real quirks and nature, their passions. I do not agree with the cliche that his stories are not stories, that they do not really have plot or narrative. It seems to me that very often the story is told in a description, or in a monologue almost as an aside. And that the reader does get a sense of some kind of real happening.<br /><br />I said that Chekhov looks into the Russian soul. What is surprising that the ' secular writer' does understand so much about Russian religiosity. And that he presents something more complex than a simple one- sided condemnation of church corruption. Chekhov's work is too filled with dreamers  , and in the story 'Daydreaming' one outcast tramp tells his dream of making a new life to the two wardens taking him to a far different fate.<br /><br />There is a richness of character and soul in this work.

He now is approaching one - hundred and his birthday will be celebrated this year, also with another collection of his poetry.<br /><br />There are many reasons for wanting to read such a collection. First of all, it is interesting to see what a person has done in the course of a lifetime of work. As I understand it Kunitz evolved in style from a complex Blakean kind of writing to a more mature and simple style in which personal elements and reflections play a stronger part. Secondly, it is interesting to understand the accumulated ' wisdom' not simply in relation to his own literary craft but also about life and love in general. It is also interesting to see the kind of universes and worlds a person explores in their lifetime, in Kunitz's case these are of course many of the giants of English poetry, but his interests are also in activities like gardening,Jewish mystics, Russian poets of this century, and of course the passions of romantic love.<br /><br />I think that there is something also here which is especially admirable. Faithfulness to the task, the dedication and the ability to work through many years, is a triumph of the human spirit.<br /><br />This gives an added dimension to the enjoyment of the poetry.	2005-05-20

I quote one small passage from an essay of his to give a taste of some of the profound writing in this book.<br /><br />Writing of the religious survivor of the Shoah.<br /><br />\\"He relives in a form without precedent , anywhere, that great \\" nevertheless\\" which has always been the secret of the enigmatic optimism of Judaism. His testimony is a warning to men everywhere not to yield to death when Truth springs from the earth. It is an admonition to endure Truth and choose life. It is a plea, anguished and joyous, to share in a defiant endurance which alone reveals that Torah, despite all, remains the seal of God.\\"	2005-05-19

In its introduction he explains how doing mercy and kindness is of greatest benefit to the one who does the mercy and kindness. He teaches that doing mercy and kindness helps secure atonement for our sins, helps prolong our life, helps promote peace between ourselves and our Father in Heaven.<br /><br />Conversely, he points out how deficient is the person lacking in mercy, and how he removes himself from the Presence of the Holy One.<br /><br />In this work divided into three sections he expounds the laws pertaining to the granting of free loans to the poor, the laws governing the restoration of pledged articles and the paying of the wages of hired hands.  The second section is devoted to expounding the rewards for those who carry out this virtue, and the punishments to those who scorn it.

His classic work 'Night' perhaps more than any other work made horrifically clear the pain and suffering of the Holocaust. He has written over fifty works of literary and moral testimony, a number of which are not simply classics of literature but which changed the course of history. One of those was his 'Jews of Silence' on the fate of Russian Jewry.<br /><br />This present work is written about the Six- Day War of June 1967. It is written with the same humane quality, the same mystical lyricism that pervades much of his work. It expresses something of the relief felt in the Jewish world in 1967 when Israel overcame the threat of destruction from the Arab world initiated at Nasser's closing of the Suez Canal.<br /><br />The work moves back and forth from the Jerusalem of the present to the small Eastern European village world Wiesel lived in before the Holocaust. The work despite its poetic and revelatory qualities is confusing in its narrative line, and in my judgment far from one of Wiesel's best. Yet it does express something of the longing of hundreds of Jewish generations to return to their ancestral home in Jerusalem, and the land of Israel - and to dwell there in peace with their neighbors. It is a book written in the same humane and generous spirit ( And thus follows the ancient Jewish adage- that the greatest triumph is to make a friend of a former enemy) of all Wiesel's works.<br /><br />This work does give some feeling of that great exaltation the Jewish world felt in 1967 at its escaping existensial danger and returning to its holiest places.	2005-05-17

On the one hand there is the Divine assurance and promise that the Jewish people will always continue to be. This should be in itself enough, in one sense. On the other hand there is the Shoah, the murderous destruction of more than one- third of the Jewish people in an effort to wholly destroy them.<br /><br />When the authors undertook this work in 1999 the wave of increased anti- Semitism ( often disguised as Anti- Zionism) which  has been building especially in the Islamic world in the past five years did not really have the strength it has today. Thus they could look outside traditional thoughts of Jews as a people of affliction. I also do not believe that focusing on that particular point of suffering is the wisest basis for survival but the fact is that the Jews are singled out, that the nation of Israel is the only one in the world which many other nations aim to destroy. In other words while I understand the strategies spoken of in this book, especially the learning from Orthodox experience, I think the first priority in regarding Jewish survival must be in looking at the threats today facing the heart of the Jewish people, the state of Israel.<br /><br />Nonetheless I would heartily recommend this work , a work done by two devoted caring Jews with deep understanding of Jewish society in modern times.	2005-05-16

They were slight little remarks, and sketches and did not have anything of the penetrating depth, the moving power of real poetry. They are a kind of light verse and have at times a certain humor. I remember Mailer writing then that he wrote these poems only because he was going through a time when he could write nothing of real importance.<br /><br />I do not think it is a disaster or harms his reputation or his important books in any way. Most writers who are known are known for one or two of their works, and the rest go largely unread. These poems the 'promo material ' says show another side of Mailer, light, whimsical tender, etc etc. Perhaps.<br /><br />But as he himself says he has always taken it to be the writer's task to deepen the reader's understanding and consciousness of life. These poems do not do this.<br /><br />A smile here and a smile there may be found especially from the drawings.<br /><br />The great advantage of the work is that you can read it fast, and forget it faster.	2005-05-16

His shift away from the Left toward a Conservative position helped mark a new period in American intellectual life. In this memoir he writes about the ' friends' of a former time, each of whom is a distinguished 'name' by themselves. Allen Ginsberg, Hannah Arendt, the Trillings, Lionel and Diana, Lillian Hellman and Norman Mailer. Podhoretz blends the personal anecodote with the ideological quarrel in explaining his estrangement from these friends. At one point he talks about how their radical indulgence in their own appetites led to a kind of moral chaos which he understood as destructive and damaging.<br /><br />There is a question raised by many readers of the morality of turning on old friends in this way, and writing as if one were the only righteous man among a bunch of misguided moral morons. Other readers point out the possible envy motive given the fact that all the people he writes about are probably considered by most to be more important ' creative figures ' than him. Certainly Arendt, and Mailer fit this category.<br /><br />Podhoretz however should not be underestimated and he as a critic , and as a moral and literary guide is a person of considerable weight and stature. I would not say that everything here suits my taste, but there is a great deal of interesting writing about the intellectual life of the American fifties, and of some of its major characters.	2005-05-16

He is a dynamic outreach person who some believe has gone too far in his outreaching. But his love of Judaism and his love of people are very clear in this work.

And he dares to say that Judaism is not getting its fundamental messages across to its own people as well as to others.<br /><br />Boteach writes in a vivid way. And generally his spirit of wishing to reach out to help others runs all through the work.<br /><br />He sees Judaism as a living faith that has a message for mankind which no only those born as Jewish, but others can rationally and emotionally adopt as their own.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book of advocacy for Judaism and is highly recommended.	2005-05-16

Among them are those who in essence call for the destruction of the state of Israel. Ilan Pappe is the most prominent here. His latest action is calling for a boycott of Haifa University the Institution that pays his salary.<br /><br />Among the other stars of this collection are Zeev Sternhall and Meron Benevenisti. Anyone who has read these two very disturbed people in the pages of Haaretz knows how filled they are with hatred for everyone, even their friends from the extreme left.<br /><br />The main line of this work is that the Israelis have been 'occupying ' Palestine since 1967 , the Six- Day War. Of course then there was no 'Palestine' to occupy but territories under the control of Jordan and Egypt. These 'disputed territories' the great part of which constitute the Biblical heartland of Israel were rundown , neglected backwaters. Israel's withdrawal from a good share of them after the 1993 Oslo agreement did not bring 'peace' but rather more Terror from the Palestinians. The famous law is in this struggle that every Israeli concession or gesture toward peace is greeted by more Arab violence. The contributors of this work seemed to fail to notice this particular recurrent feature of the conflict.<br /><br />The contributors to this volume as Alyssa Lappen points out in her outstanding review on this site neglect to mention Israel's peace offers , offers which now extend over a sixty year period. As Abba Eban famously said \\" The Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity\\" Five times they have been offered a state and refused it.<br /><br />The contributors to this volume downplay Arab terror and incitement, the inhumane and even satanic hatred of Jews evinced by the Palestinians. Since the contributors to the volume are all Israeli Jews this means that they are downplaying the hatred shown to their own friends and family. This certainly puts them in the Benedict Arnold category. They are also might be called cowardly lackeys of their own people's enemies.<br /><br />When I think of the people of Israel's love of peace, their tremendous desire just to be able to live out their lives in quiet normalcy, the terrible sufferings so many have known from Arab terror including its most recent manifestation, suicide bombing,  I am outraged at the mendacity and dishonesty of this work.<br /><br />If there is a Gehinnom( Hell) certainly the contributors of this volume have earned their place in it.ry.

Books	5	8	16	N	N	Its less boring to read about it than to watch it	This is a sociological study aimed to explain why ' soccer'(<br /><br />To the rest of the world 'football') has not become one of the major American sports. The authors speak about American exceptionalism what differentiates its culture from Europe. Among the elements are America's freedom from a feudal heritage, freedom from concentration on class war, emphasis thanks to cheap land and great space on individual economic development. The more crowded Europeans look to collective entitlements while the Americans rely on the individual to achieve his own wealth and happiness.<br /><br />This American exceptionalism helps explain why baseball, football and basketball are the sports of what they call ' cultural hegemony' in America. More people may fish and play billiards but the big three are the ones talked about, written about , endlessly pre-gamed and post- gamed, the ones at the heart of the common culture.<br /><br />In the course of telling why ' soccer' is left out in America the authors present a serious analysis of ' sports' in industrial nations.

Its emphasis is on the business, and financial success. It teaches seven principles, 1) To understand that learning is portable 2) Take care of your own and they will take care of you 3) Successful people are professionals and entrepreneurs  4) Be selectively extravagant but prudently frugal 5) Celebrate individualism and promote creativity 6) Have something to prove. A drive to success. 7) Develop your verbal confidence.<br /><br />The author claims that these principles can be learned by anyone, and thus his argument is that these traits are cultural and not genetic.<br /><br />The work does not explain the many Jews like myself who are not financially successful.<br /><br />The writer does however have a sense of humor and should be valued for that. The advice if it could be taken, which is always the problem with ' advice' probably would help people become more successful.<br /><br />I would just point out that the traits cited by the author are incidental ( except perhaps the one of caring for others) to fundamental Jewish religious teachings. Those teachings emphasize walking in the way of God, by being kind and considerate to others. And they also emphasize working to improve the world and make it better for all. Perhaps these teachings too have something to do with financial ' success'<br /><br />I would also make another point though. The Jewish tradition teaches the truly wealthy person is the one ' satisfied with his lot'. This is a contradiction of one of the principles listed above.	2005-05-10

There are four categories, Crypto-Jews ( Sephardic Jews descendant from those driven from Spain during the Inquistion) hidden children( Children whose identity was disguised from them while they were hidden during the Holocaust) Survivors ( Children of Survivors of the Holocaust whose parents tried to hide their identity from them) and Adoptees.<br /><br />As the Jewish people is a small people who has lost so many in history to persecution and assimilation there is a special sense of 'joy' at the return of those who could be conceived of as lost.<br /><br />This is an important introductory work on an important subject.<br /><br />One reader however wisely suggests another category of 'hidden Jews'. Those children of mixed marriages whose parents have raised them without any Jewish heritage or tradition. Certainly they present the largest number of those who might ' discover their identity' . Such discovery however in Jewish terms means more than saying 'Eureka' it involves a learning process by which the individual comes to understand Jewish teaching and law- and decides to practice it, and thus live Jewishly in a full way.	2005-05-10

In his first pioneering work 'The End of History and the Last Man\\" he argued that the world as a whole was moving in the direction of Liberal Democracy , and that when this ideal state came into being there would be in a sense the end of history as we know it. Now he has written a work in which he somewhat retreats from his earlier optimism, and focuses on the nuts- and- bolts of our present real- world situation.<br /><br />And here he sees that the movement toward diminishing the role of the state which had its great impetus with the fall of the Soviet Union has not always brought about the desired results. Instead of there emerging stronger more liberal economies there have often emerged ' weak states' without the power to perform the basic state functions of law enforcement, defense, protection of property.<br /><br />Thus Fukuyama believes that there is an urgent need to engage in ' state- building' that will bring about proper governance. Here however he acknowledges that the theoretical and practical knowledge of state- building is not really sufficient. And that there should be a concentrated effort to provide the knowledge required.<br /><br />Fukuyama may remain optimistic about the ultimate end and direction of history but he sees great problems in the present and near future. He points to the state- breakdown in Africa, and the failure of state- building in other areas of the world. And he questions how successful the United States can be in building state- institutions for other societies. He points out that the British Empire succeeded in laying the foundation for only  one state, India.<br /><br />He also wonders aloud about precisely how strong the state should be . Clearly the former Soviet Union and totalitarian states which aimed to take over every area of life are one negative extreme. He contrasts the United States model with the far more state- centered  European one.<br /><br />While Fukuyama centers on this particular major problem other political thinkers are focusing on other major problems , from globaliztion to nuclear proliferation, from the growing  American hegemony to the shifting of world- power to China and India.<br /><br />Fukuyama in a previous work also considered the implications of the biotechnological revolution which may be altering the character and definition of the 'human'.<br /><br />This is said not to undermine the importance of the problem that Fukuyama points to in this book, but only to indicate that it is not ' the beginning and the end ' of human problems, the one 'key to it all' or the problem which even must be most focused on at the moment.<br /><br />There is after all an 'energy crisis' ( Remember that one ) and a Demographic Dearth ( The developed  ) and the Social Security and Greying of Mankind Crisis and tens of others.<br /><br />Moreover it is by no means certain that the ' nation- state' will be the fundamental political unit of the future.

They say that it is not a diatribe but a thoughtful humorous and fact- filled work which presents the case for Jews marrying Jews. The book points to the much higher divorce rate among intermarried couples, the great difficulties there are in deciding a clear religious way for the children of intermarriage. The book also stresses the positive value of being true to a tradition which one's ancestors risked and often sacrificed their lives to keep alive.<br /><br />The book stresses the personal and individual dimension in promoting marriages between Jews. There are also important historical and communal arguments relating to the Jewish struggle for survival, and the American Jewish community's struggle to remain viable and important.<br /><br />But the real bottom line is that marriages between Jews are far more likely to be stable, longlasting, good for the children than are those in which each partner has a tradition of their own they cannot fully express or transmit.	2005-05-10

He begins with the pre-Christian Middle East divided into regions dominated by the Roman and the Persian Empires. He traces the coming of Islam and devotes one whole section to a description and celebration of its golden age in political and cultural development. This chapter alone should silence critics of Lewis who maintain he is essentially antagonistic to the region. In the final section of the work Lewish  describes how the region has failed to meet the challenges of Modernity, and he attributes much of this to the backwardness of its leaders. In the third section of the work he presents overall assessments of  the  Cultural Religious  Economic and Intellectual developments in the region. Surely this ' territory' could have been covered in other ways( More strictly chronological fashion) but Lewis provides a tremendous amount of information and explanation to the reader.<br /><br />It is interesting that the work was written before 9/11 because its final chapter does in some way suggest that a region so problematic will be problematic for the rest of the world.<br /><br />Lewis vast learning gives the reader a clear sense of the great complexity of the region, and of the major transformations it has gone through in time. My suspicion is that many people believe the Middle East has been 'Arab only' a mistaken idea no one who reads this work, and learns of the variety of cultures, religions and peoples who have played important parts in the region is likely to have again.<br /><br />This book does not set out to solve the problems of the region but it does put many of them in their historical perspective. A highly valuable work which will provide the reader a much richer understanding of the region.	2005-05-09

Nuclear Ambitions and the American Response	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Valuable study with hesitant and modest conclusions	This is a valuable study of the Iran of today, especially in regard to its government operations and institutions. Its analysis of the Iranian nuclear threat shows a great awareness of the meaning of ' nuclear Iran' to ordinary Iranians. Paradoxically while most would greet such a development with joy it would probably lead to a further restriction of their already restricted freedoms. Howard considers the possibilities for preventing the development of nuclear weapons in Iran, and seems to favor some form of European negotiation combined with more sticklike Washington behavior. And this though he also favors an American effort to dialogue with Iran.<br /><br />Developments in Iran and in the world have altered the situation since the book was published in July 2004. There is a growing awareness that a nuclear Iran will open the can of nuclear proliferation and lead to another twenty or thirty nuclear nations. i.e. it will fundamentally alter the world- situation to the detriment of all of humanity.<br /><br />Also Iran has been forging new alliances with China and Russia, has succeeded in keeping the building of the nuclear facility at Bushehr going, has a contract to receive nuclear fuel from Russia, is now insisting on its right to enrich uranium in spite of European objection. Iran is more dangerous and more determined and more powerful today than it was in July 2004.<br /><br />Howard recommends a US withdrawal from the areas around Iran but it is difficult to see how this can positively influence Iran. Iran has been also developing its missile capabilities and already threatens all US troops in the Gulf.<br /><br />Appeasement and negotiation will not stop Iran. Howard does not say or see this, and this is perhaps the major fault in his book.<br /><br />What is commendable however is the great knowledge he presents, and the reasoned and modest tone in which he presents it.	2005-05-09

One is the problem of boundaries, of defining who is a Jew, and who belongs to the community. Another problem is the one most spoken of the problem of assimilation and intermarriage. The Jewish community has in the last forty years seen an accelerating rate of intermarriage from around seven percent in the early 1950-'s to close to fifty percent today. Another problem(All these problems are interrelated) is the dimnishing numbers of the community that can no longer as it could some time ago rely on immigration to replenish its ranks. And many see that these problems are all moving the community to greater and greater bipolarization,on the one hand  a majority of assimilated and assimilating Jews with little Jewish knowledge or sense of ethnic or communal belonging, and on the other  a more intensely religiously learned and religiously identified Jewish minority. Sarna somewhat worriedly describes these problems, but nonetheless points to past communal resilience . He suggests that the American Jewish community will find  answers and new ways to flourish.	2005-05-08

His language is at once understandable , and clear, deep and suggestive. He learned from American poetry the colloquial voice and he speaks to his reader in a kind of down-to- earth language which is nonetheless rich with knowledge of Hebrew traditional texts, most prominently the Bible. Amichai writes of the great themes , love and war, and he writes out of his own experience. He writes with reverence and irony both in relation to the people close to him and to the land of Israel. His connection with Jerusalem is special and he presents the many layers of its complex history and identity through his own personal daily meanderings in the city.<br /><br />He is a humane and profound poetry who while confronting the most painful realities nonetheless presents a voice strongly affirming the value of life.	2005-05-08

In all these stories the Malamudean quite observation of inner moral dilemna is present. The humor, irony and complexity within human relationships are portrayed with a stunning exactitude.

It totally ignores the basic fact of the conflict , a fact which does not begin with the so- called 'occupation' in 1967 but which perhaps has its real starting date in 1921 when the Arabs first began killing Jews because they did not want them in the Holy Land. The fundamental fact of the conflict is  the Arab refusal to accept a Jewish state in the Middle East.<br /><br />When to go almost eighty years later Yassar Arafat rejected the offer of Ehud Barak to take ninty - nine percent of the so- called ' occupied territory' he simply proved what most analysts of the conflict have since understood ( See Barry Rubin's telling biography of Arafat) that Arafat's aim was always to destroy Israel , nothing else.<br /><br />The basic misconception of the author of this work is however supplemented by something in my opinion far worse. And that is her totally ignoring the unrelenting anti- Semitic hate- campaign that is taught in Palestinian schools and media. This and her total lack of sympathy with Jewish victims of this violence means to me that she is not simply a Quisling but a heartless one.	2005-05-07

The question is not even whether a 'majority' of Germans contributed to the Holocaust. The point that Goldhagen makes is that a considerable part of the German people willingly and eagerly contributed to the murder of millions of innocent people.<br />The 'name' therefore of Germany and the German people which so many reviewers seem interested in preserving from generalization is irreparably tainted . The ' willing executioners' were a large enough share of the German people to mean that this crime is a central part of the German historical identity.<br />I would even say that this is true were the murderers to be a small minority of the people. And this not because of the ' number of murderers' but because of the number of victims, and the cruelty in which they were murdered.<br />As for the Germans and their relation to the total dehumanization of the Jews. Anyone who wishes to know about the German attitude need only look at any of those films of the Fuhrer's speeches in which he rants and raves against the Jews while the crowd in massive hypnotic cheering shows their total approval of his Hate Doctine. How is it possible to hear a people called the source of Evil of all mankind and not approve their destruction? The German people heard the Hate, they cheered it , they agreed with it, then a good share of them took a willing part in the greatest crime Mankind has ever known.	2005-05-04

The United States supplies massive aid to the Egyptians aid far more vital than the financial aid it supplies to Israel. The US even funds the Palestinians though the Palestinians use those  funds not for the social benefit of their people , but for corruption and arms. These facts make the basic claim of this book that the pro-Israel lobby controls US policy ridiculous.<br /><br />But more. And this is a key point. Israel is the ally of the United States, the democratic ally which has helped the US in countless ways both in Cold War Times, and now even as US soldiers are in Iraq. Israel supplies intelligence and help to the US in many different area. Israel is the ally and friend, ideologically and practically of the US.<br /><br />Findlay's support for the anti- democratic forces in the Middle East, is support for those who wish to destroy Israel . All the polite words and clever little tricks of argument cannot conceal the basic truth, that Findley is on the side of the totalitarians.<br /><br />Former President Reagan made a revolution in US diplomacy when he said that what he intended to do is support US friends, and cease to kowtow to enemies. Israel is the friend of the United States, and the support given it by the White House as well as House and Senate only speak to the credit of the United States.<br /><br />This book has at its heart an effort to undermine US friendship with one of the closest allies it has , and with the one state in the world where the U.S. is most loved and admired.<br /><br />\\" Mr. Findley, have you no shame? \\"nd admired.  <br />\\" Mr. Findley, have you no shame? \\"	2005-05-03

They discuss, they argue among themselves and then they present( unjustified) their selections to the reader.<br /><br />This is I suppose one way of making yet another anthology of some of the greatest poems in the English Language. On that grounds the work is fine, and does contain many of the finest works in the language.<br /><br />But if we take the work's premise seriously then the work is seriously flawed. First of all, in regard to many great poets( Shakespeare for example) it is sheer folly to think of selecting ' one poem' out of so many at the highest level. Secondly, the poems chosen here are often ( at least in my judgment) far indeed from the poet's greatest poetry. I know for instance Stevens' \\"The Emperor of Ice- Cream\\" is an often anthologized work but it is minor in comparison to many other Stevens' works. A third fault is that obscure poets are selected while some of the greatest, Milton, for instance are omitted. Milton's \\"On his Blindness\\" is one of the greatest short poems in the language.<br /><br />I also would say that presenting the poetry in this way by author in alphabetic order with no sense of connection chronologically or thematically makes the whole business seem even more arbitrary.<br /><br />I believe that any time a person has the opportunity to read or reread a great poem they should not miss the opportunity. This work is to be valued for presenting such opportunities in a new format. And this despite its shortcomings.	2005-05-03

But his poetry is also true literature, and echoes through it many themes of the prose. Lawrence's lines are sinewy and often striking in their sudden shifts of color and tone, but I personally have never found them to demand to be remembered as much great poetry does. In a way it seems to me they are ' prose-like' in that their ' feel' is one of ' going-on-ness'. Perceptions of nature, and struggles with the demons of life are the fire of much of this poetry.<br /><br />For students and great fans of Lawrence the poems are invaluable.	2005-05-03

I was greatly moved by it, and through it understood the special burden children of survivors have to live with. Helen Epstein was the first to really explore the feelings and situation of the children of survivors. The secretness she writes about it, the things which were in the air but never spoken about play a large part in this.<br /><br />I do remember having one point in which I felt the author did not do enough. While she deals with the individual psychological of problems effectively she does not really consider the ' collective side' of the disaster.<br /><br />The imperative to keep the Jewish people alive after such a great disaster is not a subject she dwells on intensely.	2005-05-03

Many of them indicate that the book or the teaching of Neale Walsch have truly changed and saved the lives of many readers. I think on this ground alone, the fact that the book helped these readers and probably many others that it is no doubt of value.<br />On the other hand I am a bit troubled at the thought that so many people seem to so uncritically accept the view of one particular individual as to what God wants, as if the great masses of mankind of all generations did not really know or understand very much at all. I am too a bit disturbed by the supreme confidence of Mr.Walsch in positing that he knows precisely what God wants. Is this on the basis of reason alone, or is he claiming some special revelation or encounter with God?<br />I would suggest a different approach, a more humble one in which each one of us asks ourselves, asks our family religious tradition, asks all we know from life and the world, what God wants of us.<br />I think in doing that we will not come to easy peace or complete understanding, but to questioning and more questioning. I think that we will come to difficulty, problem, trouble and perhaps no sure single answer.<br />But perhaps given the complexity of life and the world, that is a more real way of engaging God and our fellow human beings.<br />I do not mean to discourage anyone or make them unhappy. I do not mean to take from anyone their Answer.<br />My own sense however is that life, and our relation to<br />God cannot be so simple and so easy.<br />I should perhaps say( not for advertisment but for honesty's sake) that I am a religious Jew who finds seeking for what God wants through reading and rereading the long Jewish tradition on this question.	2005-05-02

It is an anthology which aims to ' represent' various groups, including the recognized schools of poetry, but also including ethnic and minority groups. Thus it opens with Native American verse, and closes with verse written from Japanese interred in America during the Second World War. I may be mistaken but it seems to me that it does not represent in a great way the American experience in the Second World War.<br /><br />This does not mean it does not have generous selections from all the major poets. It does.<br /><br />It does not mean that it does not contain tens of little known poets whose work may be interesting in one way or another. It does.<br /><br />It does mean that it mixes up a vast amount of material of different levels.

Then that poem the reader takes with them everywhere. It becomes part of oneself. And those lines are there for whatever time in life one may need them.<br /><br />This anthology contains just to mention a few Dylan Thomas ' Do not Go Gentle into that Good Night' the \\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day\\" sonnet of Shakespeare, \\" Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening \\" of Frost, and many other poems which are part of the collective poetic consciousness of the English reading world.<br /><br />Whether in this anthology, or in others like it, or in the collected poems of the respective poets, these poems are there and available to us all.<br /><br />How lucky and blessed we are.	2005-05-02

At times it must seem that the only real human response to the suffering , sacrifice and above all cruelty of war is silence.<br /><br />But people speak to their reality , and war is certainly one of the great human realities. This group of poems contains most of the well- known poems written by Americans about ' the great Civil War.' It does not contain the greatest poem written about that war, as that poem was not written as a poem but as a kind of memorial speech on a field of battle. \\"The Gettysburg Address\\" is the great poem of the American Civil War. It reflects in the deepest way America's understanding of itself, its faith. It contains the deepest reflection of all on the experience of the War and its meaning.<br /><br />In this collection there is a great poem , the poem written by America's greatest poet, Whitman, about the person who in some way more than any other embodies America to Americans, Abraham Lincoln. The poem is \\" When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed\\"<br /><br />Most of the poems in the collection are verse, which express sincere feelings . I was somehow struck rereading the 'Battle Hymn of the Republic' which I sang in school many years ago. Rereading how different and how slogan- filled it seems without that larger sense of the suffering of both sides which Lincoln so nobly displayed in the 'Gettysburg Address'<br /><br />In any case this is a fine collection.	2005-05-02

This paradoxically after he late in life, after long years of struggle became well known for a romantic poem 'Tristam' which is long forgotten.<br /><br />If Robinson is read today it is for those devastating and chilling portraits in verse of lone individuals and their plight, the most famous of which are Miniver Cheevy, Reuben Bright, and Richard Cory.<br /><br />Robinson himself had a lonely and difficult life.<br /><br />I doubt that the Poetry Establishment of today finds much in Robinson. I remember however reading these poems in school and feeling them powerful and puzzling.<br /><br />The contrast between the brilliant external life envied by the narrator in Richard Cory and his actual situation when ' goes home and puts a bullet in his head' startles and shocks. The regret of Miniver Cheevy cursing the day he was born, and longing to live in days of old, too exposes human aspiration as folly and vanity.<br /><br />These poems throw cold water on the face of optimistic America, but like Sherwood Anderson and Thornton Wilder they reveal truths about small- town American life which are universal truths about the human situation.	2005-05-01

His lyrics and his songs were even in his lifetime celebrated and loved. They reflect his own passionate and perhaps often too loving nature. The story of the country Scots' boy whose writing fame led him to dissipation in Edinburgh is also the story of a great lover( His wife Jean Armour and Mary Campbell were the two most famous)<br /><br />and celebrator of that love.<br /><br />Many of his lines live in the everyday life and mind of English speakers everywhere. New Years Day is the day of his 'Auld Lang Syne' and most of us have known the wisdom given in his 'To a Mouse'( The best laid schemes o'mice an men, Gang aft agley, An lea'e us nought but grief an pain, For promised joy.)<br /><br />Poetic anthologies of English verse unfailingly contain samples of his work.

Do not say,<br /><br />\\"I love her for her smile-her look- her way<br /><br />Of speaking gently- for a trick of thought<br /><br />That falls in well with mine, and certes brought<br /><br />A sense of pleasant ease on such aday\\"-<br /><br />For these things in themselves.

He often tells a story and writes provides clear opinions on a subject.<br /><br />Kipling  is often criticized today for his championing of the<br /><br />empire, for his colonial vision of the world, for his not altogether enlightened view of the role of women in society.<br /><br />But these ' political issues' aside Kipling's verse often has a power and moral value. He writes about common people doing the work of the world. He sympathizes with the 'man in the ranks'. He is a great champion of the virtues of courage, loyalty and integrity.<br /><br />Many of his poems have been frequently anthologized and are very well known. \\"East is East, West is West, and never the Twain shall meet\\" is one of the most famous, but the most famous, and one of the most beloved English language poems of all time is \\"If\\". It is really a kind of guide to a young person of how to be admirable in life. It is constructed as a series of conditionals, as \\"If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs\\".<br /><br />Another of the most famous poems written at the time of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee,\\" Recessional\\" has as its theme in Louis Untermeyer, \\" man's impermanent grandeur\\".

Thus his amazement at the worldless Bartleby who cannot say 'yes' to anything even kindness or human consideration.<br /><br /> Bartleby says ' no' and in saying ' no' he somewhow hangs on to, and affirms his own distinct identity and individuality. He is in one sense the anti- hero whose integrity is simply in refusing to follow and obey convention and the ordinary temptations of mankind.<br /><br />At the same time he is obviously a no-body and a nothing, one who by saying 'no' also denies his own common humanity.<br /><br />One of the paradoxes of this great story is the somewhat majestic , humorous and ironic tone of the narrator who so calmly presents a tale of isolation bordering on horror.<br /><br />Close to one- hundred years later a writer far more popular in his time than Melville managed to be in his , J.D. Salinger would present in Holden Caulfield another example of the American naysayer to Society's demands, and hypocrisies. Old Holden however as opposed to Bartleby will be ' quite articulate'. When he prefers not to he will tell us all about it. Enigmatic Bartleby on the other hand charms us by his silence, and his one- track refusal to compromise. He seems to say to us , that even if we think we understand him, we cannot.<br /><br />And this too is part of this work's special mystery and power.	2005-05-01

I have read it over and over again through most of the years of my adult life, and I never failed to be astounded and inspired by it anew.<br /><br />The narrator is Ulysses who has returned home after many years of adventures. Instead of resting on his laurels he prepares to set out again. The poem is his telling of his thought before setting out, and also his describing the work of his son Telemechaus who will stay home, and ' tame a savage race' do the work of the ruler that Ulysses himself should perhaps be doing.<br /><br />Ulysses is as he understands himself on the verge of Old Age, and yet feels the need to explore and more deeply know the world. He shows his great appreciation of his comrades who will set out with him. He sees his own life as an endless quest and adventure in which he becomes part of all he meets. He rejects the idea that to live is merely to breathe, and sees that life in order to be true life must for him have a setting out a challenge a movement to a new world. He too aware of the great struggles and sufferings he and his comrades have gone through in the past , shows courage in setting out again.<br /><br />He proclaims his faith in this view of life in the powerful closing stanza of the work.<br /><br />\\" Tho much is taken, much abides, and though we are not that strength/ which in old days moved earth and heaven/ that which we are we are / one equal temper of heroic hearts/ made weak by time and Fate/ But strong in will/ To strive , to seek, to find, and not to yield.\\"<br /><br />A great great poem indeed.	2005-05-01

This book is subtitled ' a brief history of the twenty- first century'. Perhaps I am too literal, but history is written about what has already happened. There is as yet no history of the twenty-first century.<br /><br /> This book is rather a series of observations about present - trends in world- affairs, and their supposed  extension and intensification in years ahead.<br /><br />It is a  work of sociological, economic, political observation about the state- of - the- world at present. Friedman opens the book by paralleling his venture into the former third - world, on a  trip to India ,to that of Columbus journey to the Indies. But though he is no new Columbus , he is an experienced observer and commentator of world- affairs ,one with a great deal of knowledge and experience.<br /><br />Here his main thesis is that the great advantage of the world's Western advanced nations in the economic struggle for markets and jobs has been eroded considerably by the advent of new opportunities given to formerly remote and backward places, by the Digital, the Internet revolutions, by  rapid and cheap optical fiber communications, by ' outsourcing' by rapid advances in technical education in certain parts of the former Third World. Friedman in his visit in Bangalore the Silicon Valley of India saw the future, masses of young and enthusiastic Indian engineers who can do at a far lower rate advanced design work for contractors oceans away. Friedman who often introduces his own personal and family anecdotes into the narrative says that once he was certain that an average person born in Poughkeepsie New York would have a far better opportunities in life than a genius born in India. Now he would opt for the genius in India. He worries what this will mean for his own daughters. And in fact he worries very much about the future role and status of the United States where he says fifty- one percent of engineers now receiving graduate degrees are foreign born.<br /><br />A sympathetic critic of Friedman  Nobel Prize Economist Joseph Stiglitz points to the primitive conditions of the mass of Indians living a few miles away from the high- tech complex at Bangalore. He suggests that the world may be flattening but that it still has considerable bumps in it, and will so in the future.<br /><br />Part of Friedman's argument is suggesting that the world may be paying too much attention to the Middle East, and other possible sources of World Terror. In other words that it may be paying too much attention to the ' negative ' areas outside the West, and not focusing upon those in which there is not economic backwardness, but instead real 'progress'. Friedman too suggests that the emphasis should be shifted to looking at what individual entrepreneurs and small businesses are capable of doing throughout the world.<br /><br />His work is one of a number of recent new books on China, and India and suggesting that a great transformation is coming , one in which the US may well lose its present status as overwhelming global leader.<br /><br />Having read through many years many many books which point out the ' single new trend' that is going to define the human future I am  skeptical about the all- embracing conclusions drawn here. It is possible to make a long list of factors which might work against China and India , including demographic, environmental and even military ones. North Korea or Iran to take one example could in the next few years put all of Mankind a bit closer to the Stone Age. So again it seems to me that Friedman's confidence is exaggerated in believing he has read the future.<br /><br />This is a good book about some very important things that are happening in the world now . It is not the 'key' nor ' the answer' nor necessarily even the ' main factor ' in determining the way the world will be run fifty or even five years from now.etic critic of Friedman  Nobel Prize Economist Joseph Stiglitz points to the primitive conditions of the mass of Indians living a few miles away from the high- tech complex at Bangalore.

His whole life was a struggle to help return Jewish sovereignty to the Holy Land, to build a state for the Jewish people in which they could live in security and freedom. His struggle began in his native Poland where he was initially involved in the Betar Movement under its charismatic leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky. It continued even when he was exiled to Siberia by the Soviets and when he released made his way to the Holy Land as a soldier in the Anders' Polish Army. In Eretz Yisrael he became the leader of the Irgun one of the leading groups which fought the Mandate and the British efforts at restricting Jewish immigration to the Holy Land. At the time of the struggle for Independance Begin showed his characteristic nobility and greatness when he refused to open a Civil War even though his people were attacked on the Altalena. This ability to be self- effacing to think of the overall well- being of the people of Israel characterized Begin throughout his life, and made him in  the most beloved leader the people of Israel has known in modern times. This type of thinking for the benefit of the people as a whole were also evident in later Israeli crisis situations, including the Suez campaign of 1956 , the Six- Day War of 1967, the Yom Kippur War, the Entebbe operation. When after eight failed attempts in 1977 he became the first non- Labor Party Prime Minister of Israel he too followed this path, and led to the first Israeli peace - agreement, and most important to this day with Egypt under Anwar Sadat. Begin as Prime Minister also devoted himself to improving the situation of the poor families of Israel.He also during his time in power made the critical decision which led to Operation Osiris an action which prevented Saddam Hussein's Iraq from obtaining nuclear weapons. This action almost universally condemned at its time was later hailed by many Western leaders as one of tremendous importance . His Lebanon war campaign aimed at preventing Terrorist action against Israel led to a complicated, prolonged war he had not intended. As this campaign wore on and the protests from within Israel against it increased , Begin also suffering from bad health , suffered a cruel personal blow , the loss of  his  wife and helpmate of over forty years Aliza. This blow and the strain of the political situation led to his resignation.<br /><br />Zvi ( Harry ) Hurwitz was a member of the Begin team and writes this biographical work with understandable sympathy. He details the main events of Begin's life and career. Unfortunatelty he does not go deeply into any area of Begin's life or tell us anything that is not generally known. He also does not focus on the many controversies of Begin's life.<br /><br />Nonetheless this work provides an outstanding general picture of one great Israeli leader's life and development.<br /><br />I can only comment parenthetically that as someone who lived through the Begin years as a citizen of Israel, I can attest to how deeply he was loved and how much respected by the greatest share of the people. He was paradoxically a humble, modest person with a great sense of the importance of national honor and pride. He was a person who asked little for himself but to serve his people. And he did this with dedication, courage and greatness.<br /><br />His memory is and will be a blessing and inspiration for the people  of Israel for all the generations to come.tance .

I am making this description because no such description is provided on the ' Amazon Site'.<br /><br />I simply want to tell any potential reader what the book is about.<br /><br />The book is a book of ' thoughts' or ' aphorisms' on the subject of ' creation'.<br /><br />It takes the conception of ' creation' and pairs it with other central concepts of Judaism, for instance the concepts of ' redemption' and 'freedom' providing thoughts on each such pairing.<br /><br />The basic idea of the book is one given in Tannach and taught by  Rabbi Joseph Dov Baer Solovetchik of Blessed Memory. It is that God the Creator has commanded Mankind to walk in God's way. This walking in God's way has its primary meaning in terms of moral action, in our striving to be compassionate and kind to others. But as Rabbi Shubert Spero has also pointed out it also means that God the Creator, wishes us  to be 'co- creators in perfecting the world in  scientific, artistic and other aspects of human activity.<br /><br />As I have been a writer, involved in ' literary creation' or the effort at it, all my adult life, this aspect of Creation is given particular emphasis in the book.<br /><br />The idea of ' creation' is explored and developed in the book  as a central Jewish concept by which Jews make their own lives meaningful, and work to co- create the world with God in the direction of greater goodness and well- being for all of Mankind.	2005-04-29

He is in some sense the protypical American thinker, the one who launches Transcendentalism, and with it Thoreau, Whitman, and in the darker side, Melville, and Hawthorne. He also is the extension of a long development in American religious thought from the intensity of Jonathan Edwards to the water- downed Unitarianism of Emerson himself. Away from the personal God , who enters and controls History to the Impersonal force which runs through the Cosmos.Away from the West, and embracing the East while most highly exemplifying the extension of individual power and right.<br /><br />Emerson is a difficult, paradoxical and yet often inspirational writer. Reading him or hearing one - hundred and fifty years ago must have been liberating for many. However we live in an age where Individualism and doing one's own thing is the cliche of modern American culture, a culture which at its worst is the culture of Narcissim. There are that is some cultural commentators who see Emerson as the root of all our evils, from family breakdown to moral chaos and religious decline.<br /><br />Emerson if not in the early essays is however a much more complex and contradictory figure than is readily made out. He had his own great human life- tragedies, losses of those close to him and certainly knew the ' dark night of the soul'. But he does stand at a great American moment, the moment of the American Renaissance, of America about to proclaim itself as the great force of progress and motion in the world. Emerson is singing the soul electric, and the one alone who escaped to tell thee, he is too paradoxically the father of William James Pragmatism, and Henry James' most refined explorations of consciousness.<br /><br />I do not myself take particular courage or comfort from his ideas ( which again I think are now part of the commonplace mainstream of American mind) but I do value the voice and the thought of the man who walked across the Boston Commons ' glad to the brink of fear.'thought of the man who walked across the Boston Commons ' glad to the brink of fear.'	2005-04-28

He is the most skilled craftsman, perhaps, that the language has known. \\"Like the alexandrine that drags its slow length along\\" Pope everywhere illustrates a mastery of form as feeling. Yet precisely his precision and his intellect are what make the verse less than deeply appealing to a poor romantic soul such as myself. Pope can be a master moralist ( Vice is a monster of such frightful mien/ that to be hated needs but to be seen/ but seen too oft/ familiar with her face/ we first endure, then pity, then embrace./ And he can hold up the mirror to man and nature in a way that inspires rational hope. He can play and mock at us ( I am his master's dog at Kew, pray tell me, Sir whose dog are you?) but he does not reach the deepest down nature that the Romantics that come after will.<br />This fine collection contains his most famous poems \\" The Rape of the Lock\\" and \\"The Essay on Man' and the reader can know through this work the best of Pope. But whether the best of Pope belongs in the same league with Shakespeare, Chaucer, Milton, Keats, Wordsworth, is another question.<br />PS I have just been rereading 'Essay on Man' and I think my previous remarks are somewhat wrongheaded. Pope 's thought is complex and ordered, and expressed with a beautiful facility of phrase. There are many memorable lines. I think I made the mistake of looking for Pope to be another kind of Poet, and not appreciating fully the kind of brilliant, intellectual, impersonal, philosophical Poet he is.	2005-04-28

The lines of the 'Songs of Experience\\" are of a more problematic reality. \\"Tiger Tiger burning bright in the forest of the night/ What immortal hand or eye/ Dare frame thy fearful symmetry/?<br /><br />Blake is a thinker with an ideology, a revolutionary but I think his greatest value is not in the political or even metaphysical ideas but rather in the psychological apprehension in lines of beauty. Blake understands that wrath held within it will grow, but spoken wrath may go- he understands that the road to hell may be paved with good intentions. His proverbial quality is in this simple , or seemingly simple poetry too , and he is telling us about life and soul while uplifting us with lines which ring and remain in the mind.<br /><br />These poems are Blake at his most accessible and memorable, whatever literary critics may say about the longer epic poems. These are the poems which have meant and will mean much to mankind. And they can be read with pleasure and puzzlement, over and over again.	2005-04-28

For me the poet Arnold is 'Dover Beach'. \\" Ah Love, let us be true to one another, for the world which seems to lie before us, like a land of dreams, hath really neither joy nor light nor love nor certitude, nor peace nor help from pain, and we are here , as on a darkling plain, swept with confused alarums, of struggle and flight, where Ignorant armies clash by night.\\"<br /><br />This great poem written at the threshhold between an Age Dying and another yet to be born is Arnold's signature piece. I also however recommend, and have some knowledge of his long poem 'Sohrab and Rustum'.<br /><br />Arnold is a poet whose music sometimes fades, but whose quest for moral meaning is regularly present.<br /><br />He is one of those rare human beings who has written a single poem, a few lines which should be remembered for as long as poetry is read and enjoyed.	2005-04-27

Karsh carefully reads the ' so- called revisionist historians' and shows how they have deliberately falsified records, used skimpy facts, made massive generalizations from a single instance, omitted and slanted evidence that contradicts their own claims.<br /><br />Unfortunately this work will not undo the damage these ' historians' have done .They have succeeded in creating 'myths' about the conflict which are part of the commonplace perception of it today. These myths fit in well with the Arab propaganda effort to deligitimize Israel.<br /><br />One would wish that this present volume would be much more widely disseminated than it has been. I would suggest that in this regard the first audience should be the journalists who cover the Middle East, who often carry with them some of the ' intellectual distortions' promoted by the revisionist historians. The second place should be the Middle East Studies Departments of all  Western universities.	2005-04-27

Pappe totally identifies with the Palestian  Arab cause, and places the major onus for the conflict on the Jews of Israel. Thus he slants the major historical and political realities, in which the Jews have five times agreed to a peace plan based on partition while the Arabs have insistently refused to accept the Jews right to a state of their own. Pappe underplays the persistent and systematic Arab violence and terror which have been at the heart of the conflict from its beginning. He mistells the story of the 1947-1948 war minimizing the Arab agression, the calls of the leaders of Arab states for Palestinians to temporarily abandon their homes , so that invading Arab armies would be able to kill Jews more freely. He underplays the countless initiatives made by Israelis from all walks of life to live in peaceful relations with the Arabs. And does not really put the conflict into the  context of the pan- Arabic, Islamic fundamentalist, and Arab nationalist processes which perpetuate the conflict even today.<br /><br />This is Revisionist History at its worst, a distorting and ignoring of the factual and objective reality in order to promote a ' cause' . That cause is disguised and misrepresented in the work.<br /><br />For Pappe as anyone who reads carefully will see  is calling for a Jewish state which ceases to be Jewish in any meaningful way, and eventually becomes an Arab dominated one , in which its Arab minority will eventually become its majority. Pappe's analysis is one which aims to help bring about the destruction of Israel.<br /><br />Is it surprising then that most Israelis consider him to be both a hypocrite and a traitor?	2005-04-27

'Felix Randal, the Farrier'  The world is filled with the Grandeur of God, 'Pied Beauty'.<br /><br />Hopkins is in my feeling one of the greatest of English poets. His verse has an intensity, a freshness in which he sees into the deepest heart of things. It has a portrayal of mood and feeling, especially despair which is deep and unique. His language is his own and his rhythm a remarkable invention and return to primal Anglo-Saxon sprung verse. Some of his lines go with me all the time, inspire and fill me with a sense of how Beauty in Words lifts the Soul.<br /><br />I myself love two poems of his above all, the one which begins with 'Thou art Indeed Just Lord' and which ends with 'Birds build, but not I build, but strain , Time's Eunuch, and never breed one work that wakes, Thou, O my Lord of Life, Send my Roots Rain. \\"  And the second I most love is the title poem of this collection, \\" The world is charged with the Grandeur of God/<br /><br />It will flame out like shining from shook foil/.<br /><br />There are other more richly annotated editions of his poems which are also recommended.	2005-04-27

But I have also found the great mystical and memorable beauty of the verses to speak musically and poetically in a deeper way than the Yeatsian ideology. The whole Yeatsian world of gyres and perhaps gimbels, of spiraling apocalypses and oujii board seances , of automatic writing and ideas of a New Age Slouching to be Born never seemed to me historically compelling.<br /><br />The lyrical Yeats( And we shall wander hand in hand, through hilly lands and hollow lands, and pluck till Time and Times are done, The silver apples of the moon, the golden apples of the son,) is what has been most appealing to me.<br /><br />And here there comes to mind a whole medley of immortal Yeatsian lines from \\" We must all lay down where the poem starts/ in the foul rag and bone shop of the heart\\" to \\" The best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate intensity\\" from \\" Let us go now to Innisfree \\" to \\" How many loved your moments of glad grace, but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, and loved the sorrows of your changing face\\" the lines which appear again and again in all the anthologies made of English lyrical poetry.<br /><br />A great poet is rare indeed and Yeats is one of them.

In a sense there is an advantage in this as it encourages the reader to engage the text, and seek understanding through reading and rereading. But there is also a great disadvantage especially when it comes to complicated poetry like that of the Metaphysicals whose complex linking of diverse images , whose intellectual toughness requires explanation.<br /><br />Nonetheless there is great poetry here at the usual Dover very reasonable price.<br /><br />As for the Metaphysicals themselves Donne is of course at the center. But there is also great poetry from Herbert and Marvell. This is a poetry in which the heart is very much in the mind, and one must have a strong intellect to understand.<br /><br />I know the challenge and delight of this poetry, and also understand how many readers find it most fascinating and great.( As did T.S.

It also includes much of the most memorable shorter work.<br /><br />Wordsworth is one of my favorite poets. His simple clear language, his quiet reflectiveness, his direct and arresting descriptions of nature, his deeply moral relation to life, his sublime metaphysical reflectiveness, his tranquility, his presentation of recollecting self at the heart of his work, his philosophical sublimity and clarity, his sympathetic relation to ' common people' his nobility of utterance, his capacity for creating great and memorable lines are all evidenced here.	2005-04-26

But the mystery of Leonardo's personality involves more even than this intense life of inquiry through which he made considerable contributions to mankind's ' seeing' of the physical world. The mystery of Leonardo is also connected with his remarkable capacity of creation in architecture and in painting, in drawing and invention. It is connected with the way he seemed to personally embody the human quest to by understanding the world transform it into an engine of human use and beauty.<br /><br />In this excellent biography we learn much about the technical basis of Leonardo's quest. We learn of his early education and his relation to that turning point time in human history , the Italian Renaissance. We learn of his connection and learning from his great Renaissance- Man predecessor Alberti who too in mastering many realms presents a kind of riddle for the ages.<br /><br />We too are made to see how for Leonardo ' seeing'is a ' way of thinking' and how his personal extension of the human capacity to see provides new perspective to human anatomy and terrestial landscape.<br /><br />But we too in learning of Leonardo's life learn something of his limitations and how far he was from the kind of mathematical and abstract apprehension of the physical world which would come with the Scientific Revolution.<br /><br />We too know more but do not essentially solve the mystery of why and how such creative power should come into the world, and serve as paradigm of the human quest for knowledge throughout the ages.<br /><br />If Leonardo notoriously omitted always one key detail in presenting his inventions, if he needed always to keep a secret element for himself so we in trying to understand his mind and work seem too to be always missing the key element, the miraculous clue that will put all we know together and solve the mystery of how and why such greatness was given to this particular human being.<br /><br />Perhaps a great truth illustrated by Leonardo's life is that in our quest for knowledge we necessarily raise new questions which continually extend and expand the unknown. Perhaps too Nicol in giving us so much valuable detail about Leonardo's life has also added to the realm of what we must strive even harder to know and remain humbly more ignorant of.the mystery of how and why such greatness was given to this particular human being.  <br />Perhaps a great truth illustrated by Leonardo's life is that in our quest for knowledge we necessarily raise new questions which continually extend and expand the unknown.

In this popular work there are many pictures of Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda, their friends and their world. Mizener focuses on the life- story and does not provide much commentary on the work. But he does make clear the romantic American mind- sight that ruled Fitzgerald throughout. His quest for experience and his faith that through the experience he could come to the realization of his dream. Reality was harder and more contradictory. On one side the descendant of genteel but poor ' old Americans' and the other of nouveau riche Irish  Fitzgerald was a continual striver to belong in social worlds. Mizener chronicles the not especially wonderful tale of the self- indulgent Fitzgeralds in the Jazz Age world, here and in Europe. He tells the story of their romance, and their rivalry , of her betrayal of his sense of inadequacy and yet loyalty to her. He skimps on one central theme and thread in Fitzgerald's life the story of his connection to and devotion to his daughter. Fitzgerald's struggles to make money and his struggles with drink clearly impinged upon his writing, and shortened his life. Mizener to my surprise does not focus and explain the miracle of Fitzgerald's signature piece, his masterpiece, \\"The Great Gatsby\\". Instead he contends that the flawed \\" Tender is the Night\\" is the deeper work.<br /><br />Mizener also does not really enter the question of the sources of Fitzgerald's immense literary gift and power, the magic and beauty of his prose, and the romantic character of his vision. There is a sense that the work has the details right but really does not get to the heart of what Fitzgerald is. The work somehow lacks the inspiration Fitzgerald's writing was so rich in .<br /><br />It does however provide valuable information about Fitzgerald including the story of his generosity to Hemingway in helping convince his publisher 'Scribner' to take on Hemingway's breakthrough work , \\"The Sun Also Rises\\".	2005-04-25

More than anyone else he helped build the Israeli Air Force into one of the best in the world. He was the architect of the Israeli lightning air- victory in the Six Day War. Later he entered politics and was a central figure in forming the Likud party and helping bring a major transformation , the dethroning of the Labor party and the  bringing of Menachem Begin's Likud  to power.This work is the story of these early glory years.<br /><br />It does not tell of the political conversion Weizmann made in later life, his moving into what is called the 'peace- camp' in Israel, his key role in the peace negotiations with Egypt at Camp David. It too does not tell of his controversial reign as President of Israel.<br /><br />Like his sometime rival Yitzhak Rabin,  Weizmann for many exemplified the Israeli sabra hero of the first years of the State. Frank, humorous, tremendously innovative and energetic he brought life and flavor into all he did .  He was a true believer in Israel, and the Zionist enterprise and a great contributor to it.

The Mishneh Brureh on Pesach begins with the laws for making a check for Chametz.

The major character, an actress who has been forced into retirement, and who has an uneasy relationship with her daughter comes to the Retreat and like its other inhabitants is enclosed and imprisoned by it. Appelfeld is a master of depicting such marginal characters, who seem somehow unreal and threatened not only by the hostile world outside but by their own lack of substance. On the edge of the great destruction of the Jewish people these characters seem half- dead and in some way longing for their own destruction.<br /><br />Though I sense the art, the depth, the cunning of the master writer at work here I nonetheless found the reading difficult and claustrophobic.<br /><br />Appelfeld is a writer of immense critical reputation, and truly a writer of unique perception, experience and sensibility.<br /><br />He is truly a unique and troubling  voice, the remembrance and the promise of a terrible disaster that has already happened, and is told as if it is about to come.	2005-04-24

His portrait of his detached divorced father who remained alone in the house his family once lived in, and spent fourteen lonely years there is restrained and moving. The portrait becomes at a certain point an extended family history and reveals a great family secret, the shocking murder of Auster's grandfather by his grandmother. The detached father who is the central figure is described as an extremely colorful character, a lonely ladies man who thrived on quick passing affairs and hard work. Auster's effort to sort out his own emotional connection to his father makes a sincere, honest record. The father- son relationship here is the heart of the story, and Auster tells the one he has with considerable skill and feeling. And this when the father- son relationship does not here have the kind of charged emotional complexity the great tormented depth that Kafka reveals in his immortal ' Letter to his Father'. It too does not come close to the kind of liveliness and depth that Philip Roth reveals in description of his relationship with his father in ' Patrimony'.<br /><br />The second part of the work in which Auster is now a divorced father meditating on his own life and literary work is less humanly interesting. Its abstract literary reflections may have a Pascalian value of their own but they do not hang together as the first part does.	2005-04-20

In those years he was a tremendous builder of the City who greatly enhanced its cultural life. His devotion to the City was a twenty- four hour a day one. His famous catnaps at all kinds of public function were the sign of how untiring he was in his efforts to build the city. The whole Israel Musuem cultural area of the city owes an enormous debt to his . When he was Mayor Jerusalem turned from being a little backwater into a dynamic and growing city with international flavor. On the whole Kollek sought to be a good Mayor to the Jewish majority and Arab minority of the City .<br /><br />His own story climaxes in his career as Mayor but he also did valuable service as aide to Ben- Gurion in helping build the State of Israel.	2005-04-20

Tomalin is over-forgiving of Pepys betrayals of friends and family, of his frequent physical and sexual abuse of women including his own wife. Pepys betrayal of his brother and sister his frequent cruelty to those members of his family who could not serve his social climbing goals make very questionable the heroic image Tomalin provides of him. She surely overrates his greatness as a writer and explorer of the self.<br /><br />Pepys is a diarist of tremendous curiosity who is capable of recording his own intimate acts with a certain kind of objective impersonality.<br /><br />Since Pepys is famous for his sexual antics I expected this biography would make some effort at real analysis of his character. It does not do this but contents itself but relating and celebrating his exploits. Reading this work we thus know much about what Pepys did without necessarily understanding  who he really is.<br /><br />Pepys unpleasant side was also revealed in his greatest career year, the Plague Year . While one of every six people in London were falling victim to the Plague Pepys was happily recording his advances in career. A  very hard worker, and a masterful<br /><br /> bureaucrat he nonetheless does not show a broad and humane sympathy for others.<br /><br />For those who love English social history , for those who want to know a great deal about Restoration England, for those interested in understanding how bureaucracy works, and how people get on and by in the world, this biography is outstanding. But for those who wish to understand human character in depth, including that of Samuel Pepys this book it seems to me is as lacking as Pepys himself was.	2005-04-20

This is his eighth book and it centers on the present situation of American Jewry. It contains a lengthy introductory overview essay summarizing the findings of the work as a whole. The body of the work consists in seventeen interviews Gerstenfeld conducted with leading American Jewish  communal leaders, and  public intellectuals.It is a distinguished list :Alan Dershowitz, Gary Rosenblatt, David Harris, Malcolm Hoenlein, Stuart Eisenstat, Abraham Foxman, Marvin Hier, Daniel Pipes, Shoshana Cardin, Rela Mintz Geffen, David Ellenson, Ismar Schorsch, Norman Lamm, Richard Joel, Carole Solomon, Mark Charendoff.<br /><br />  Most of them in one way or another address the threats presented to the community by demographical factors, increasing intermarriage and assimilation, aging populations, decreasing communal participation on the part of those under forty. But they frequently come to contradictory conclusions in regard to deeper analysis of the situation, and proposals as how to strengthen the community as a whole. Dershowitz condemns the present leadership and finds them ineffectual and lacking in initiative. Norman Podhoretz is impressed by the contradictory trends within the community, the withering and assimilating majority opposed by an increasingly more religiously learned and committed minority. His distinction suggests that a prediction made ten years by Rabbi Nachum Amsel which sees the Jewish world dividing into two groups, a Jewishly ignorant one and a truly committed knowledgeable one may be coming closer to being an accurate description of the American Jewish reality. Others such as Richard Joel and Marvin Heir provide encouraging stories of the building of individual institutions , respectively Hillel , and the Simon Weisenthal Center) which have strengthened the community as a whole. The book is a rich one and provides a  great deal of insight into the American Jewish situation now. Gerstenfeld himself in his summary essay touches upon another crucial matter for the community its relation to Israel , and the effect that what he calls the ` mega- event' of Sept.11, 2001 has had upon the situation of American Jewry. In this area a number of the essays touch upon the ` new Anti- Semitism' that has emerged on the Left, and has become prominent on a number of American campuses.<br /><br />This is a volume which should be read by anyone who has real concern for the American Jewish community and for the Jewish people as a whole.<br /><br />I would however add that I would have like to have seen in this volume a more detailed analysis of the possible security implications for Israel and the Jewish people as a whole as a result of future developments in the American Jewish community.ht into the American Jewish situation now.

The trend pointed out in this book toward increasing Jewish retreat from communal participation and responsibility fits in with the wider pattern in American society as a whole. The shift in focus from inherited shared traditional commitment to absolutely autonomous individual choice in defining one's relation to the Jewish community is both a fact of life and a signal of decline. The contradiction to this trend  is the improved Jewish education an increasing minority of the community is receiving. Such education ideally does strengthen communal commitment and responsibility.<br /><br />I have heard Steven Cohen speak about the issues raised in this book and had the sense that he was far too optimistic in believing that the very partial and limited kinds of Jewish connection so increasingly prevalent among American Jewry can be a source of real communal strength in the future.	2005-04-13

His answer to its major problem , the problem of assimilation is to turn the world upside down, and see it less as problem than as opportunity. He sees that each non- Jewish partner is a potential convert to Judaism. And he advocates that the Jewish community become far more active in promoting conversion, and in welcoming new members.<br /><br />Unfortunately as I understand it this is more an ideal answer than a real one. This book was published in 1999 and as I write this in April 2005 the record shows that in intermarriages a decreasing number of couples are raising their children as Jewish i.e. intermarriage is not proving to be an opportunity no matter how liberal Reform and other conversion procedures , be.<br /><br />Tobin can of course claim that the reason for this is the entrenched opposition of the American Jewish community to converts. But as I said there are many Jewish Reform leaders who advocate Tobin's approach. This is not bringing masses of converts to Judaism.<br /><br />I in fact believe that despite the good intention Tobin is mistaken here. I believe that the emphasis of the American Jewish community should be on intensifying Jewish education. I also believe that it should be in educating to Torah and Mitzvot. I believe if the community became more religious it would be a much stronger community.<br /><br />I in essence believe then that despite what Tobin says here assimilation is the great disaster of the American Jewish community.<br /><br />Tobin's heart is in the right place, but I believe his judgment and reading of the situation are not.<br /><br />However the creative and revolutionary solution offered to the painful assimilation problem, the pain remains and so does the assimilation.	2005-04-13

His writing works on many different levels, and often has a simple surface story meaning which is eminently understandable. But beneath there are layers of complexity and irony, a deep awareness of Hebrew poetry, and traditional religious sources. Amichai's themes are the great themes of literature, themes of love and war, of comradeship and loss. His poetry too centers on his city, Jerusalem, and is a reading of its landscapes and mindscapes.<br /><br />In this volume there are scholarly essays that enhance our understanding of this poet.<br /><br />But Amichai who learned much from American modern poets use of the colloquial is excellently translated into English here.<br /><br />Who meets this volume meets a poetry of exceptional meaning and beauty.	2005-04-12

In this work he uses the device of allowing the widow of two -major artists to in retelling her life story present a picture of post-war American art - history. There is much precise description of mind and art. It is possible thus to learn a great deal about the art- world from this work. It is also possible to learn a great deal about certain kinds of lives , about human relationships in these worlds. However the feeling that the work gives me is a somewhat distressing and difficult one. I do not feel any real sympathy for the major character or for those she tells her story about. Perhaps the reason for this is the richness of detail and analysis. But I think it goes deeper than that , and has something to do with Updike's fundamental way of feeling the world. And here I admit I have had this same reaction to other works of his, a tremendous admiration for the skill of the writing, and a reservation about his capacity to create a central character one can feel deep sympathy for.	2005-04-10

The editor John Brockman in his introduction describes the work as divided into two parts, the first devoted to theory and the second on the future ' in practice'.  In the first the topics include ' advances in cosmology , the use in mathematics of virtual unreality systems, new directions in complexity theory, speculations on what it means to be ' alive' on how we learn,on how we think on the nature of consciousness and how we feel, on whether or not we are along as a unique form of intelligence in the universe.'<br /><br />In the second part the topics are the 'the future of DNA sequencing and what it will teach us about ourselves, the exploration of Mars and the search for extraterrestial life, our command over matter, our intimate interaction with our machines and particularly our computers, the future outlines of cyperspace, neuroscience, and the way we raise our children, and the prospects for our continuing physical and mental well- being.'<br /><br />This volume is a very rich one. Three essays I found particulary interesting were that of Robert M. Sapolsky ,'Will we still be Sad Fifty Years from now?'  Mihaly Csikszentimihalyi on 'The Future of Happiness'  and 'Nancy Etcoff on 'Brain Scans, Wearables and Brief Encounters'<br /><br />These essays it seems to me taken together suggest that fifty years down the line we will not  be living in Utopia but will still have to contend with disease and depression.<br /><br />Again my brief words do not give an adequate sense of this rich and highly recommended volume.	2005-04-10

In this work he gives signs of the voice to come but has not yet freed himself completely into a voice of his own. Nonetheless the work is an interesting one, a kind of ' double ' of a Dostoevsky work ' on the double theme'. It is also a book about how one can pettily sustain one's own hope by resenting others. An Anglo- Saxon holder of the keys to the kingdom resents the Jewish intruder about to come on to his intellectual turf. This novel echoes Bellow's own experience in being thrust away as an undergraduate from the English Department at Northwestern. The work has flashes of the kind of social criticism and general historical and cultural reflections  Bellow would  refine to a high art in later works, primarily 'Herzog'. This is not in the first rank of Bellow's books but because it is Bellow it is still an intelligent, probing and stimulating read.	2005-04-07

But because it is Bellow it has a lot worth reading in it. His thoughts about society and culture may not always be exactly on the mark, but they usually stimulate and inspire. In this novel the hero is a bit less sympathetic than many of his other main characters. Henderson, Herzog, Humboldt, Sammler , Augie March have vivacity and life that Dean Corde does not.  The Dean's wife too falls short of Bellow's livelier and more appealing feminine creations, for instance the Ramona and Madelaine of Herzog. So too the whole spirit of the work has about it a pessimism and bleakness which contrast strongly with that of Augie March, and Henderson, and even in its way, Herzog. This book is really a winter book, and it has coldness and dying in it. And it has the oppression of the Communist Iron Curtain world in Romania, and the depression of Chicago's most beaten and desperate streets. The characters and the story seem less alive than the ideas.<br /><br />Again this is not one of his best. Far from it. But it is Bellow and because of that a worthwhile read.	2005-04-07

'Dangling Man' and ' The Victim' were two compact novels written as Bellow himself said ' correctly'. In this work he finds his own voice, an exuberant Americanese open to the open road of all experience, and happy to create itself in being transformed by whatever it meets. It has its roots in Chicago, and in the Yiddish language and in Russian and American literature, but it takes off in its own particular colloquial way. Until Bellow no one put the mind to the service of reconstructing everyday life in the same way. James of course put the mind to use in transforming experience but his world was a refined one and his people consciousnesses of subtle complexity. Augie March and Saul Bellow meet the world, and the street and a thousand characters on their picaresque road, and like Twain's Huckleberry Finn they seem to talk the languages of everyone they meet.<br /><br />As to the overall structure of the book, and its goingonness , I can say that for me this work is a preliminary to better Bellow books , above all , Herzog. But this is the real introductory shot, the announcement that a new voice is being heard in America literature.<br /><br />And what hope and youth in that voice. God bless you, Saul Bellow for having had it. (This review is written a day after Saul Bellow has gone with the help of God, to a better world).	2005-04-07

I love it in part because it captures the spirit and feeling of two worlds I know well, one is the upstate New York Troy- Albany area world, the other is the world of Jewish religious Yiddish speaking immigrants to America. But I think even more than this what I find in this story is a story of family love and hate, of passion and intensity in human relationships. The story is fundamentally of the relationship between a brother and sister who ostensibly become estranged over a family inheritance,  a ring. The brother a master maneuver and real estate mogul has risen from poor origins to wealth, and a world and a level beyond that of his resentful sister. She cuts him off. But in a dramatic reconciliation scene at the close of the story there is an incredible depth of tenderness and resignation and wisdom.<br /><br />My abstract words are a poor summary of this remarkable story. It carries such a weight of meaning in it, said and unsaid, that I cannot possibly describe it.<br /><br />In my judgment it is a very great story, one of the greatest.	2005-04-07

Before reading this I had a sense of nepotism playing a part in the world, but now I have a far stronger sense of how real this phenomenom is even today. One only has to take a look at present day popular culture to see the scions of the famous becoming all out of proportion to the average, famous themselves. Bellow  provides an excellent historical analysis of nepotism in different periods and among different kinds of population. There is a strong suggestion that nepotism is a universal of human life and culture, given the fact that parents often care more about their children than they do about anything else in the world.<br /><br />However one important point Bellow repeatedly makes is that ' being a close relative is not alone enough'. If one lacks the talent and ability then in time one loses the power and place.<br /><br />I myself take a special interest in the passing of spiritual legacies generation to generation, and dynasties of great 'minds'. One interesting point which does not particularly relate to this book. None of the great philosopher as far as I know has a child who is a great philosophers. But in the world of Jewish spiritual life, and Torah learning, there are great dynasties like for instance the Soloveitchik family. Here the heritage and the education within the family are crucial. A parallel might be made in the world of music with the Bach family, with their one overwhelming genius, their two top flight composers and their hundreds of musicians through many generations.<br /><br />This book should be of interest to everyone who cares about people, and about the way the world works. It is an outstanding study.	2005-04-07

The poems are among Carver's best. They mark out the time of life when he is most deeply disturbed. So the poems about alcoholism ( although this is not the right way of saying it because they are never simply just about that) are among the most moving. His long poem on Charles Bukowski is very effective. It gives a sense of how this kind of 'portrait of another person' by seeing the world through his voice, can truly be an insight into the writer's own life also. Of course the poems about marital discord and break -up also tear at the heart. Carver writes \\"Someone else is raising my children, and bedding my wife\\" .<br /><br />All in all the honesty, the direct language and feeling, the storytelling power , the sense of appreciation of everyday seeing and feeling of life- all this work together to make these poems of fire ,poems which even when they tell of destruction give off a burning light.	2005-04-06

It was put together with the help of the love and companion of the last eleven years of his life, the writer Tess Gallagher. She also includes a long introduction to the work explaining the process of the book's making.<br /><br />Carver is a poet of directness, simplicity, emotional courage. His poems are often stories built around direct observations or statements of his present mood, a mood that is also reflective on other times of life. The poems which I believe are most moving often have to do with relationships, with his father, with his former wife, with his children.<br /><br />His world is often a disordered and painful one, the alcoholic's world , the world of those in debt and down. But there is in him almost always a redemptive appreciation of life, a certain hidden joy and emotional surprise which gives the poems their special life.<br /><br />Among the beautiful poems of this work is one called 'Cherish' in which he tells of the tenderness in his relationship with Tess Gallagher.<br /><br />I was very moved by the last poem , a fragment that sums up the man and the redemptive power of his work.<br /><br />LATE FRAGMENT<br /><br />And did you get what<br /><br />you wanted from this life, even so?<br /><br />I did.<br /><br />And what did you want?<br /><br />To call myself beloved, to feel myself<br /><br />beloved on the earth.	2005-04-05

They have real pain and an honest confrontation with whatever it is Carver meets, and tries to contend with. The honesty comes with the brokenness of the life .And there is a sense that the man is telling you what he feels and what he knows and what he has learned from life. And its not an easy life. It has martial discord, and distance between loved ones, and a lot of drinking, and mixed- up relationships. But what I think redeems it and makes the poetry of Carver so appealing is that it too talks genuinely of what is good and meaningful in the life. It can be a phone - call from a brother which connects them remotely again and reminds them of the world they had once together now largely gone. It can be a meditation on a writer ( Machado) which evokes a sense of how Literature can deepen our perception into the world, it can be a lament in understanding a former wife's feelings.<br /><br />It is simple language and understandable. It tells a story. It has a lot of the disorder of life in it, and the kind of scandalous things most of us would rather do without . It has embarassment and shame and failure and poverty and regret and sorrow and love- much much love. As in the poem in which he takes the time to himself given by his beloved's absence but refuses to do one thing sleep in their common bed without her. It has a rough integrity of a real human being and poet.<br /><br />This is the real stuff. Enjoy it.	2005-04-05

Adahan using this system classifies people in nine types, the principled reformer or abusive perfectionist, the altruistic giver or bitter martyr, the self- assured motivator or arrogant fraud, the spiritual alchemist or decadent depressive, the insightful observer or paranoid recluse, devoted loyalist or paranoid rebel, the accomplished adventurer or indulgent hedonist, the magnaminous leader or sadistic bully, the tranquil peacemaker or dissociated automaton.<br /><br />Adahan combines traditional Torah teachings with modern psychological methods in an effort to increase human self- awareness, and help people overcome their own suffering and live better lives.<br /><br />Whether one wholly subscribes to this system or not it is possible to see that Adahan is using it as a tool to bring people to have greater chesed (mercy and kindness) to themselves and to others.	2005-04-04

For me the major element was in hearing so many different voices who are essentially sympathetic to Israel, this at a time when the Jewish state is under propaganda attack from the extreme left and the extreme right everywhere. But the major idea of the Summit, it seems to me, is especially important. The idea that moral clarity about the conflict between Jews and Arabs in the Middle East can come through understanding the historical reality seems to me a sound one. For if one has an idea of objective truth, and fairness- and if one believes in Justice then one should be able to weigh conflicting claims, and look to an answer for the conflict. The fact is that most of the claims of the Jewish side have been ignored and distorted by the other side since the beginning of the conflict. And there has emerged a strange process by where the Jews bend over backwards to understand and give to the ' other side' while the other side denies any Jewish claim and history to the Holy Land. This running away from Truth on the part of the Arab side, this refusal to recognize the legitimacy of the other is what has led to disastrous perpertuation of the conflict.<br /><br />Many outstanding people spoke at this conference, from former Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to Richard Perle, Alan Keyes, John Loftus. I would simply like to commend one speaker especially the historian Joel Fishman who gave a telling analysis of the connection between the Soviet - and Vietnamese conception of ' total war' and the strategy adopted by Yassar Arafat for destroying Israel. The key point here is that the aggressor will sacrifice the good and well- being of its own people in order to destroy the enemy. This explains Arafat's action when in September 2000 he opened up the latest terror war phase against Israel. It did not matter how much his own society suffered as long as he would move the process forward of destroying the enemy. Fishman's exposure of this line of thought made what seemed to be an irrational process ' rational'.<br /><br />On the whole this work gives great new insight into the Arab- Israeli conflict. And it makes it clear that without real change on the Arab side toward recognition of the reality and legitimacy of the other there can be no peace in the Middle East.n's exposure of this line of thought made what seemed to be an irrational process ' rational'.  <br />On the whole this work gives great new insight into the Arab- Israeli conflict.

His genius also consisted in a powerful capacity for interpreting and reinterpreting the realities before him, so that he gave us the sense that there is more in us than has been dreamnt in any of our philosophies.<br /><br />The master investigator of the human mind was an immense and complicated mind himself.

Thus Michael Carrithers tells us the story of Buddha's life, of his coming to meet with a sick person, an aged man and a corpse, his renunciation of the world and his wandering until he meditating calmly under a Bo tree comes to the enlightentment that is his liberation.For forty- five years afterwards he wanders and teaches but when he leaves the world the seed has been planted , there are followers who will spread his teachings throughout the world.<br /><br />I write these words without understanding what ' enlightentment' means and without knowing why I should seek for it, and without having any sense of why it is right to be liberated from the pains and difficulties of our most intimate human connections. I write these words without knowing why it is better to be ' enlightened and kind' rather than to be ' just kind'. And I write too without really understanding how one can have detachment and peace without faith in a personal God.<br /><br />It is not enough to read a book, and take in the meanings intellectually to truly understand it.<br /><br />I do not understand the way of the Buddha, but my sense is that this work is a fine introduction to beginning to know it.	2005-04-03

The present volume consists in her weekly commentaries (Parshat HaShavuah )on the second book of the Five Books of Moses, `Exodus.' Her aim is not to expound upon the surface (pshat) meaning of the text, but rather to provide a midrashic commentary. In this she looks for hidden narratives and meanings for alternative understandings as a way of deepening our understanding of the text.  Here she brings to bear her own reading in secular sources, particularly in literature, psychology, sociology and anthropology. But she relies primarily on her intimate knowledge of the traditional Rabbinic commentaries.  She does not work to build some overall theory or superstructure but rather intuitively and poetically to extend the meaning of the text.<br /><br />  For those who are knowledgeable in Torah this book will provide a real enrichment and delight in understanding. For those less knowledgeable this book will hopefully lead to a fuller engagement with the Biblical text.	2005-04-01

It reveals that most intermarried couples who have children do not provide a Jewish education for their children. Such an education Barack - Fishman indicates is a crucial factor in determining the future religious identity of the child. It is regrettable that a smaller percentage of intermarrying Jews care to provide an education in their own faith than do intermarrying Catholics or Presbyterians. Barack- Fishman indicates that intermarried couples divorce at a much higher rate than do inmarried ones, three to one in general, and two to one for Jewish intermarrieds. She also reveals that the orthodox have considerably lower intermarriage rates, and considerably higher levels of communal committment than do the Conservative .The Reformed have the lowest rate of inmarriage. As many Reformed Jews come from intermarried families this is not surprising, when one understands another finding, the children of intermarried couples tend to intermarry at a much higher rate than do inmarried couples.<br /><br />This study confirms what Jewish community leaders and educators have known at least since the 1990 Demographic Study on the American Jewish community i.e. that intermarriage has reached records level in the community and is more weakening the community ( On the whole of course. There are many opposite examples of the Jewish community being strengthened by intermarriage. In these cases it is often the partner who has converted who shows the strongest commitment to Jewish community connection and education) than it is strengthening it.<br /><br />This is a very well researched and important study. Again its major finding is that the American Jewish community must greatly enhance its quality and quantity of Jewish education if the community is going to remain a significant one in the future.	2005-03-31

It centers on Rabin's lifelong dedication to the Security of Israel. It explores his development and understanding of the security doctrine of Israel. Inbar says that Rabin was not a systematic thinker but rather a pragmatic and capable leader. He is considered one of the founding fathers of the Israeli military force. He is considered also one of the great teachers of military doctrine  in the Israeli Army . This study examines his view of strategic doctrine, his attitude toward US part in the Security of Israel, his relation to non- conventional threats.It also tells the story of Rabin's great contributions to Israel in its wars. Most notable in this regard is the part he played as Chief- of- Staff in the Six Day war. It notes the turnabout in Rabin's policies which came with his making of the Oslo agreement. Inbar makes it clear that Rabin had considerable doubts about this policy, and wished to pursue it cautiously.<br /><br />Anyone interested in the military history of Israel, or in a deeper understanding of how a major Israeli leader thought on questions of security would do well to read this work.	2005-03-31

I wish I did. I read the first six pages of the book which explains how various scientific disciplines have in the course of History broken off from Science, and come to constitute fields of learning of their own, and understood that this is a very clearly written and informative book. I am sure that it will lay out clearly the major questions raised today in the Philosophy of Science. As I understand it one major idea of the work is that there are philosophical questions that Science cannot answer . Or to put this in another way that Philosophy in a sense sets the limits of scientific inquiry.<br /><br />What strikes and troubles me in terms of the relationship of Philosophy and Science is that the latter produces in many cases testable conclusions, and thus has the authority of providing us ' truth'. And this when as far as I can tell or feel ' philosophical discourse ' is like discourse in the humanities, ' interpretative'. And it thus does not provide us with what is testable, objective, and ' communally held'. Of course I know that one of the questions of Philosophy of Science is whether there is such a 'thing' as ' objective truth'. But clearly in common sense terms, and in terms of the way most people think and act in the world of the mind ' scientific results' do have a quality in truth, that ' philosophical arguments ' do not.<br /><br />I am curious as to how this volume deals with these questions.<br /><br />I apologize for taking the reader's time.

Nonetheless Raymond Williams provides an interesting study of Cobbett's life and work. Cobbett according to Williams is not a systematic thinker who developed a series of ideas important to posterity. He is in the words of the book- jacket, \\" an extraordinary character, - soldier, journalist, farmer, political activist, man of the people\\"- whose principal concern was the material poverty of his time, the emergence of a rentier class , and how to radically transform society into being more fair and humane.<br /><br />This is an excellent sketch of a figure more important to local British history than to world culture as a whole.	2005-03-30

Neitzsche Tanner claims is the most written about philosopher in the world today. He claims that he has been the patron saint of post- modernists and deconstructionists, structuralists and other academic schools of reading texts. He mentions but does not dwell upon the evil and horrible misreading of Nietzsche made by the Nazis. Neitzsche Tanner seems to say has been adopted by all kinds of different people and schools all of whom put his work to use for their own purposes.<br /><br />In this regard Tanner points out the negative influence of the publication of Nietzsche's  notebooks and journals. He claims that often these were half- baked ideas and not what Nietzsche would have necessarily presented to the public. He points out how careful Nietzsche was in polishing , and even rewriting whole works. And he claims that the published writings are far superior in their style and quality of thought than the notebooks.<br /><br />In contradiction to this it seems to me that none of Nietzche's major ideas, not the will-to -power, not the 'eternal recurrence' and certainly not the ' ubermensch superman idea ' are of positive value to mankind today. I would even maintain that his telling insight into the cultural state of Europe in which the West seemed at his time to lose the meaningfulness given by a felt presence of the Divine ,is not a final definition even for the old continent. So too his critique of Christianity , his contempt for the idea of Christian equality seems to me to not be of any real positive human value.<br /><br />It seems to me that the religious and philosophical problems facing Mankind today , including the problems created by Mankind's unending usurpation of Divine powers have no real answer in Nietzsche. Our world in which we are the threshhold of ' enhanced human beings' ' cloning ' ' two hundred year life spans' ' possible nuclear destruction' is not really the one that Nietzsche lived in. In this regard it seems to me it is not Nietzsche alone among the great philosophers in not really addressing the kind of unprecedented Reality mankind is confronted by today.<br /><br />Therefore however dramatic and powerful many of his ideas might seem the best reading of him is as a kind of inspired literary master, a maker of philosophical fictions, a most brilliant aphoristic stylist, a man of extraordinary intelligence and humor but not a thinker who really can address the questions facing Mankind today for tomorrow.the one that Nietzsche lived in.

He is the successor of Locke who pushes British Empiricism one more step in the direction of Hume's skepticism about our knowledge of the real world. His great denial is the denial of physical reality, the materialness of the material world. The only Reality for Berkley is Ideas that are in the Mind of God.<br /><br />Berkley is thus not really of the breadth in dimension of the political thinker Locke or the historian Hume.<br /><br />Urmson does not dwell much on Berkley's life giving us the bare details and even less than that. For instance he tells us that Berkley has a wife and a son but really does not indicate anything about his personal character relation to his family etc.If the Past Masters series is to tell of the life as well as the work then this particular volume falls short.<br /><br />We do learn certain details about Berkley including the story of his failed American venture.<br /><br />Urmson is good at presenting a picture of the intellectual and scientific world Berkley found himself, and relating how Berkley's philosophy was a reaction to this world. He too tries to show how what seems to be a ' ridiculous idea on the surface' can be interpreted to make strong sense philosophically.<br /><br />This particular volume I am sure will be of great use for those who take interest in the close technical arguments around the subject of philosophical ' idealism.'	2005-03-29

The Hebrew of Agnon is a multi-layered language in which he employs many different kinds of traditional language and text. Part of his great ironic power is playing his own texts off against the tradition he is continually evoking and moving in out and away from. In this work he tells the story of a Second Aliyah pioneer to the Yishuv and in doing so makes a rich and complex commentary not only on the Zionist enterprise but on the role and place of the Jew in the modern world.  This is work also fits the well- known theme of ' The Dreamer and his disappointments in meeting reality'. But Agnon is a writer who often tries to appear more simple than he is, and often the disappointments too give a kind of insight and meaning which makes having them valuable. The wanderings of Kumer, his search for dignity in building the land, his search for love, his wandering between the new world and the traditional world, between Tel Aviv of the secular pioneers and the Jerusalem of the Old Yishuv are all parts of the richness of this work.<br /><br />It is however precisely Agnon's intellectual playfulness and irony which would seem to stand as barriers before the reader's direct identification and sympathy with the characters.<br /><br />I in any case prefer some of Agnon's stories to this larger and more ambitious work.	2005-03-28

As these words are written and as the IAEA hum and haw, and as the world goes about its other business, Iran is persistently building its military and economic power. Later this spring Russia will launch Iranian satellites that will provide precise information on targets throughout the Middle East. The Russians have just signed an agreement to supply nuclear fuel to the Iranian plant at Bushehr which is expected to go online next year. There are reports of secret tunnel work being done by the Iranians to conceal nuclear activity near Esfahan. The list is long and the pattern is clear. Iran is working intensely to develop nuclear weapons, weapons which would wholly upset nuclear non- proliferation agreements , which would tremendously increase the possibility of  a nuclear terror attack.<br /> This present work does recognize the seriousness of this threat . It also covers new ground in tracing out the threat presented by Iran's domination of the world -oil- market. Here it is important to note that a nuclear Iran would be able to blackmail the world , and intimidate entirely its smaller Persian Gulf neighbors.<br />As to second thesis,the controversial allegations in the book about American politicians involvement with Iran I have no knowledge of the subject and cannot comment. On the surface I do know that the United States has firmly opposed Iranian nuclear efforts, and has boycotted Iran in various ways for over two - decades. Iran's major achievements in weapons procuration and development have been aided by by China, Russia, and  Pakistan's Khan ring. Also North Korea and its missile technology are important. One touches Iran and one reaches all those forces in the world which are opposed to the United States and the free world.<br />This book is important in pointing out the dangers presented by the growing power of Iran. Unfortunately  stopping Iran is not primarily a matter of American internal politics. The problems and enemies are without. How they will be addressed is one of the major challenges facing this Administration and most likely a number of Administrations to come.<br />I would along with this book recommend another recently published book on Iran, Al J. Venter's ' Iran's Nuclear Option'.

He should read Peter Strathern who gives a lot more in a lot less space.<br />He does make a serious effort on touching on the main points of Hegel's political philosophy. And he does provide a reading of the ' Phenomenology of Mind' in which he explains Hegel's theory of History as the story of the  development of human Consciousness.<br />He too bends over backwards to try to defend and excuse some of Hegel's more objectionable political ideas. He explains that Hegel was not simply a lackey of the Prussian state in his speaking of how all human history came to its realization in it. The State according to Singer according to Hegel means something more than just the 'state' rather it means the total social reality encompassed by it. This of course too does not explain how History could have come to penultimate realization in the Prussia of the nineteenth century.<br /> Singer tries too to explain away some of Karl Popper's devastating criticisms of Hegel's state- authority- worship as prelude to the totalitarian nightmares of the twentieth century.<br />He ends up noting all the wonderful influences of Hegel upon the Left Hegelians including that lovable character who contributed so much to the great creative efforts of the Soviet Union in the twentieth century- Karl Marx.<br />It seems to me that Singer might have done a better job had he taken a bit seriously Kierkegaard and Nietzsche's devastating criticisms of the kind of castles - in- air Hegel built.	2005-03-28

It does trace the story of his public life and career. It tells of his long preparation in politics his work for Shaftesbury, his many friendships with political figures and thinkers not only from Britain but from Holland and France; it tells of the four years of political exile in which he wrote his masterpiece \\" An Essay on Human Understanding\\" tells of the fame this book brought him, and his public career afterwards- but it tells almost nothing of his emotional and intimate life. This may not be the main thing, but as Ben- Ami Scharfstein has shown in his work on the  lives of the great Philosophers- understanding  the life may provide key insights into the work. Locke never married but he did have one significant long- term relationship with the woman who was his best friend intellectual companion and confidante, Damaris Cudworth, later Lady Masham.<br /><br />Dunn ably explores Locke's championing of the value of religious tolerance( for dissenting sects of Protestants but not for Catholics) his pioneering efforts at basing human understanding on knowledge given by the senses. He shows how for Locke<br /><br />\\" knowledge itself is a form of perception\\" He shows where Locke contradicted the teachings of the one from whom he had learned so much Descartes, especially on the matter of innate knowledge. For Locke the mind is a ' tabula rasa' at the beginning, and all we know we know through our experience. Knowledge which is the perception ' of the connexion and agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our ideas\\" is for Locke always \\" particular ideas existing in our own minds\\".<br /><br />Locke's insistence on verbal clarity, his insistence on the role the senses play in \\" furnishing men with the knowledge of nature , \\" are still Dunn claims valuable today. Dunn too shows where Locke is more pessimistic about our power of understanding especially in regard to the way the power of custom,  the ' elaborate process through which men form, modify and protect their beliefs\\"  and the \\" unedifying character of most worldly desires\\" lead to distortion in perception and thought.<br /><br />Nonetheless Locke stands as the great forerunner in major changes in the human perception of the individual's power to know and right to believe. He is the pioneer of those ideas which would be embodied in the American Declaration of Independance and Constitution. It is possible to  argue that he is one of the few of the great philosophers whose work can be said to have done some real good in the world.<br /><br />This is a very clearly written study and a highly valuable introduction to his thought.to the way the power of custom,  the ' elaborate process through which men form, modify and protect their beliefs\\"  and the \\" unedifying character of most worldly desires\\" lead to distortion in perception and thought.  <br />Nonetheless Locke stands as the great forerunner in major changes in the human perception of the individual's power to know and right to believe.

He was the preeminent European posek(Halachic decisor) in the post- war period. This biography tells his own personal life story but also provides an insight into the struggles of various streams within the Orthodox world for position and predominance during his lifetime. A product of the world of the Yeshivot and of the Mussar movement he also was educated as a scholar at the University of Giessen. There he was taken under the wing of a great Gentile scholar of Judaism Paul Kahle. There too he taught a class in Torah to non- Jewish students .His immense learning won him the respect of scholars throughout the world of Jewish learning. Shapiro makes it clear that Weinberg was an advocate of what he himself exemplied the combination of Torah learning and higher secular studies. And that Weinberg was troubled in his last days at the thought of a Jewish world of learning so narrowly focused as to lose its capacity to have influence in the real world. He believed for instance that certain kinds of secular knowledge would be necessary to make the state of Israel viable and independent. Shapiro does not provide a deep psychological analysis of Weinberg's character but does tell the basic biographical story including that of his unfortunate marriage. He indicates that Weinberg lived his life in great loneliness,especially in his last post- war years in Montreux where he headed a small Yeshiva.<br /><br />This is in a way an unusual biography of a Torah giant as it not a hagiography, but provides a solid historical accounting. It is again especially instructive in the picture it gives of the Orthodox Jewish world, its divisions and conflicts.<br /><br />Weinberg is presented as a human figure capable of error(As in his initial support of the Nazis when they first came to power. An opinion he rapidly changed) but also as a great Torah scholar dedicated to the ideal of Jewish learning and the preservation and enhancing of the Torah world.eservation and enhancing of the Torah world.	2005-03-26

It contains books which to be read properly must be reread many times. And thus it in a sense constitutes a lifetime project in reading, and education.<br /><br />It is difficult to fault Mortimer Adler for his idea and initiative.<br /><br />I would however register a few reservations. How is it possible to talk about great Western books without talking about the book that influenced the West more than any other? i.e. The Bible. Years ago when I took the Great Books of Civilization course at Harpur College in Binghamton New York, the Bible played a central role. And this also because it is impossible to really read and understand much of subsequent Western Literature and Thought without it. Imagine reading Dante or Chaucer without knowing the Bible.<br /><br />Secondly, it is wonderful to have the original works. They are the heart of the matter. But I have found through the years that up-to-date scholarly introductions and afterwords to the ' great books' enrich their meaning tremendously.<br /><br />Thirdly, the list is of course incomplete. Western Literature without Joyce? Western Philosophy without Wittgenstein?<br /><br />Fourthly, and here I may be way off, it seems to me that people read differently these days than they did once. The Internet has made people move from thing to thing more rapidly, and to devote long blocks of time to one ' single object' is less the normal mode of things. My guess then is that fewer people percentagewise would really educate themselves by going through the Great Books, one by one.<br /><br />Finally. The 'best things that have been thought and said' lift our hearts and minds, and help make us more fully human.<br /><br />For helping so many people to do this the editors of 'Great Books' certainly should be commended.	2005-03-24

And the fact that Science went nowhere for close to two thousand years because in part it followed Aristotelian conceptions is not strongly held against him.<br /><br />Aristotle is not the literary stylist Plato was.

Like Paul Johnson, Conor Cruise O'Brien ,the late James Parkes, and a very long list of others he is one of those non- Jewish , in this case Christian writers, who show a deep understanding and appreciation of the Jewish people's contribution to humanity.<br />I write this now with special feeling because the world recently has seen a rise in anti-Jewish feeling( admittedly more from the Islamic than from the Christian world) which so deeply distresses as it comes a little more than half a century after over one- third of the Jewish people were murdered simply because they were Jewish.<br />And here I think I come to one of the gifts of the Jews spoken about in the book. While the emphasis in the work is on the Jewish gifts of Monotheism, of deepening appreciation of human individuality, of understanding History as a progressive redemptive story ( and not a hopeless cyclical repetition) of social justice, I want to here focus one quality the Jews stressed.<br /> It is the quality of being merciful and compassionate. And it is the commandment which of all commandments is repeated most in the Bible i.e. the commandment to be just and compassionate to the stranger because you were strangers in Egypt. And here it is important to note that the signature of the Jewish people, the name of founding father is Abraham ( in Hebrew Av-Rachum Merciful Father). And that this quality of mercy and consideration of valuing each and every human being as a special creation of God is the major idea the Jewish Tradition teaches Mankind should hold dear.<br />I know there is criticism of this book along the lines that the Egyptians also  had some idea of Monotheism, and that the Greeks certainly( though their formative period came later) had an idea of 'individuality'. But it seems to me that the question is not one of taking credit or blame .<br />It seems to me rather that there are fundamental values which all of Mankind should share, and that one basic one is respecting the dignity and divine essence of every individual. I think that Cahill presents a convincing argument that the people of Israel helped make this contribution to Mankind.<br />It seems to me in this that the gift of the Jews, the greatest gift, the idea of a moral and loving God Who cares for each and every human being, and Who demands of them a walking in the way of mercy and justice is in this sense perhaps best spoken of not so much as a 'gift of the Jews' but as a gift of God to Humanity in which the Jews served as messenger of.hare, and that one basic one is respecting the dignity and divine essence of every individual.

His teachings have formed the basis for the political and moral wisdom that  informed Chinese life until the Communist revolution. Confucius is not a metaphysician and he is not really a 'religious figure interested in inner spirituality'. He is concerned with proper and right action in the world in order to develop a decent society.<br /><br />He lived in times which were a bit too interesting, that is times of troubles in which feudal warloads contended with each other on the back of the broader populace. His effort in a sense was to bring a greater level of order and decency to the society as a whole.<br /><br />In his own life he did hold public office( Most surprisingly as a kind of sheriff cleaning up efficiently an outlaw province)but spent the last ten years of his life wandering through China looking for a political position. He left the world as do so many of the world's most influential thinkers in disappointment, and without any sense that his teachings would be the basis of an enlightened Han dynasty that would rule China for four - hundred of its best years.<br /><br />In this book Paul Strathern is somehow at his most irreverent, humorous best. He concludes the work with brief descriptions of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism, the three major faiths to this point in China.<br /><br />Naturally as a very condensed work this book does not really enter the intricacies of the Confucian ethic. But it is an excellent introduction and a highly enjoyable read.	2005-03-22

The problem is that Aristotle did so much and much of it complicated to explain. As Strathern says at the outset he is one the great polymaths of all time, and he investigated every area of reality he came into contact with. 'The master of all those who know' is also the one who believed that ' man by his nature desires to know'. He was in my judgment here speaking very much for himself, as a good share of humanity it seems to me very much does not want to know anything that contradicts their own particularly comfortable view of the world.<br /><br />Strathern tells Aristotle's story , his studying at the Academy under the teacher who gave him the basis of his thought, Plato, his tutoring of the world- conqueror who almost had him done away with , his effort after Plato's passing to become head of the Academy, and his having to settle with establishing his own Lyceum, his two marriages and his apparent decency as a human being.

For Strathern Locke is one of the political thinkers who has done the most good. There is much to be said for this view as the emphasis in Locke on individual rights, on tolerance, on liberty are a major influence on the US Declaration of Independance and Constitution.<br /><br />Locke also has a decisive influence on the philosophical tradition and turns it away from Aristotlian scholaticism toward learning through experience. In his great work an 'Essay on Human Understanding' Locke analyzes the way we come to know the world. He suggests quite in contradiction to what is believed today, that the mind is a tabula rasa a blank slate at the outset of life upon which experience freely writes. We today have more a sense of the inherent structures of the mind, linguistically and cognitively.<br /><br />Locke's analysis of the 'impressions and ideas' we have in terms of our apprehension of the primary and secondary qualities of objects is based according to Strathern on the difference between the measurable and non- measurable qualities, and is thus related to the rise of scientific investigation during Locke's lifetime.<br /><br />From Locke would of course follow Berkeley and after this the true demolition job of Hume. From the imperfect knowledge of the world through experience in Locke there would come in Hume a questioning of our ability to confidently know anything at all.<br /><br />Locke is not one of the most brilliant of the great philosophers, but nonetheless one of the most influential.<br /><br /> Strathern does an excellent job of telling us how this is so.	2005-03-22

He is not the most dramatic or the most appealing. His language does not have the brilliance of Plato or Nietzsche. Locke builds no great system like Kant or Hegel. Locke does not pretend to solve for all time the problems of philosophy as does Wittgenstein later on. He does not claim to be overthrowing the present order and changing Mankind toward an ideal state as Marx does. He does not really make claims for himself.<br /><br />What he does is present an idea for political life, for human society in which there is tolerance of the opinion of others, individual liberty , freedom of speech and expression- a state whose role is to protect its citizens and not force them to follow strictly its own idea of absolute good.<br /><br />My mentor at Cornell one of the preeminent students of American history and culture Professor Emeritus Cushing Strout pointed out that it was Locke more than any other thinker who helped bring about the American Revolution.<br /><br />Strathern tells the story of Locke's- not especially exciting life- , including his connection with Lord Shaftesbury, and the love of his life Damaris Cudworth ( later Lady Masham) very well. More importantly he helps us understand why Locke was a major creator of the modern method of searching for knowledge in experience( And not through Scholastic nitsplitting).

He is the central figure in Chinese social and political thought, and his prescriptions have been the rule - of -life among China's ruling bureaucracies for hundreds of years. In his small work Paul Strathern humorously chronicles the efforts of Confucius to provide an ethic of decency for a feudal world living through troubled times. The wisdom of Confucius is not meant to save the individual soul but rather to enable society to function decently. Confucius in his own life, Strathern makes clear was not exactly the model of success. And he died disappointed and far from the political office he would have liked to have held. But he left a legacy which Chinese civilization as a whole would adopt.<br /><br />This work gives an excellent outline of Confucius life and work. It is a good beginning for anyone who wishes to explore the subject in greater depth.	2005-03-22

The author has great sympathy and understanding for Sartre though not in an uncritical way. He understands that Sartre in many of his political choices erred, especially in his support for the Soviet regime long after it had been discredited in the West.<br /><br />Sartre was an orphan genius, and a man who truly went his own way, walked courageously his own individual path in all areas of life and thought. This meant he wrote the books that he wanted to, books in which he stressed Man's need to make his own meaning through action. The father of 'atheistic existensialism' Sartre gave the famous formulation ' existence precedes essence'. As he understood it man is thrown into the world with no defined essence and he makes through his life action whatever transient meaning it is to have. In what is arguably his masterpiece the novel ' Nausea' he shows how this condition of being in radical contingency in a world without preordained meaning leads to a sense of the absurdity of all existence.<br /><br />In his personal life Sartre apparently had the need to reestablish in adulthood the kind of mother- sister relationship he had with his own mother. His candidate lifelong companion and intellectual disciple Simone Beauvoir began as his lover, and remained his best friend. Their story and friendship is one of the great intellectual sagas of the century. It has its ugly sides especially in regard to her having 'procured' for him younger feminine companions. Their ' open marriage' is a prelude to the breakdown in the family, in the institution of marriage which is part of Western life today. They cannot of course be held solely or even primarily responsible for the direction in which the culture was moving but they set the ' bad example'.<br /><br />Sartre was a tremendously prolific writer. Strathern believes his best work is the autobiographical 'Les Mots'. Of the many plays only ' No Exit' is still sometimes staged. The philosophical toebreaker ' Being and Nothingness' has not seized a central place in the world philosophical curriculum, despite its many interesting passages. The most accessible philosophical work is ' Existensialism and Humanism'. The last big philosophical work, 'Search for a Method' is like all his later Marxist writings destined to eternal oblivion.

I am not sure that I understand most of it then, and I am sure that I do not remember most of it now. But I know one of the topics was the 'reality' or non- reality of what the visible world gives. Appearance and reality. Another topic if I remember rightly is the mind-body problem. And Russell I believe here takes on the Descartian cogito and tells us that it does not mean that Descartes has proved that there is an 'I thinking' but rather only that there is ' thinking'.  Russell in this seems to be something like a  very strange kind of Buddhist. In any case it is these hard problems of epistemology that are at the center of this small work.<br /><br />The other kinds of big problems, moral and aesthetic, religious also which are at the heart of a good share of human experience are perhaps not quantifiable enough for Russell's kind of philosophical consideration here. The man that tried to reduce all of mathematics to logic did take on these other kinds of more 'human ' questions in other works though not I might say to the satisfaction of many of us old religious believers.<br /><br />This little book is however a clear and challenging introduction to major epistemological questions.	2005-03-21

The first Existensial writings are devoted to individual development expression and freedom. The second period in Sartre's philosophical life, the Marxist period is said to be devoted to the value of'Equality'. And the third less extensive period to the value of ' Fraternity' In this period Sartre calls for the disappearance of the State, and places the focus on bonds of friendship, Fraternity. This rough classification is of course ' rough' and as Steven Priest makes clear Sartre is an Existensialist throughout concerned with the fundamental themes of human life, liberty, justice, life, death, anxiety, being, nothingness, truth and authentic existence.<br /><br />The work is divided into eighteen chapters each of which deals with a major theme of this kind.<br /><br />In it the reader can have a good feeling of the overall development of Sartre's philosophy, and can judge what they regard to be of value in it.<br /><br />My own sense is that the truly important Sartre is the Sartre of the first period, of the existence precedes essence, of the making of meaning in our own life through our action, period.<br /><br />But the philosophy of this first period too would seem to me to fall short of answering true human needs, and providing hope of ultimate meaning.For that one has to go to a kind of religious existensialism which of course Sartre would have nothing to do with.	2005-03-21

And here the indictment comes not necessarily out of a desire to injure, but simply through stating the facts about certain aspects of Sartre's life. His capacity for multiple loyalty was very great especially when this had to do with young women. And according to other sources de Beauvoir's role in these relationships was not necessarily a very good one.<br /><br />Still we are talking about two very significant 'minds' who fertilized each other- two great friends who helped and inspired each other- and if one , Sartre, was the senior partner, and the other deBeauvoir the survivor who has the last say still their dialogue and their life, and this work of farewell have real meaning.	2005-03-21

Kant is the prelude to Hegel and then to Marx. Kant was once thought by many to be the culmination of all philosophy.<br /><br />Strathern does not deal in this work with the followers and successors of Kant, nor with his standing in the world of philosophy( if there is such a thing) today.<br /><br />He does provide background to Kant(The synthesis of the rationalism of Leibniz, Descartes, and of the empiricism of Locke, Hume) He does show how Kant made a critical move accepting the Humean claim that real knowledge about the character of reality could not be known. The Kantian maneuver of concentrating on the categories by which we  perceive the world ( including time and space) leaves us without ' the - thing - in itself)but with a capacity to make sense out of the world, and trust scientific investigation of it.<br /><br />Strathern in his usual excellent way narrates the story of the poor Kant's rise to philosophical greatness. Hard and steady work, and a drudging devotion to knowledge are the keys to the Kantian exploration of many different fields. The Philosophy comes late after years of preparation , the mature product of long thought. The three great Critiques , the first on Metaphysics, the second on Morals, the third on Aesthetics are one of philosophy's great syntheses. The exploration of the ' starry heavens above and the moral law within' provide Mankind with a new way of knowing what it can and cannot know.<br /><br />Kant himself who Strathern claims had less of a life than any of the great philosophers, a life almost wholly a life of the mind is portrayed as a bit less ethical than I had always thought him to be. Strathern tells the story of his intellectual snobbery in regard to his sisters who he refused to meet with though they lived in the same town.He also tells of his firing his longtime valet Lampe . He also tells at Kant's delight at being the witty star of various social gatherings. All of this is perhaps minor gossip and not so important when placed against Kant's intellectual achievement. I think of another story about him not told in this book. It is that when he was very old and very sick a visitor came  to see him. It was tremendously difficult for him but he stood to greet the visitor. When the visitor said that he should not have done this, Kant replied ' My sense of humanity has not left me'.<br /><br /> I think of this in connection with Kant's categorical imperative \\"Act only in accord with a principle which you would at the same time will to be a universal law\\".

Kant did not come from a family of philosophers or intellectuals. Raised in poverty he through his own constancy in learning and devotion to the life of the mind succeeded in creating one of the great philosophical systems. Heine joked at the villagers of Koenigsberg setting their watches by observing Kant in his daily comings and goings, but the regularity and method which may made him seem a dullard in life were a central element in the formation of his system. By the way as Strathern makes clear Kant was anything but dull in company. He was the lively wit and star of most social gatherings he attended. And his great popularity came to him in part as a result of the remarkable quality of the lectures he gave. All this is secondary of course to the construction of the three great Critiques, on Metaphysics, on Morals, and on Aesthetics. This system would be the great centerpiece of Philosophy until his pupil Hegel took it somewhere else.<br /><br />Strathern does not have the space to elaborate in any detail the Kantian philosophy but he does give a fair account of its origins. He too provides an extremely lively account of Kant and his personal foibles.<br /><br />There are small excerpts of the famous Kantian prose which I myself have never really been able to decipher. It always seemed to me abstraction upon abstraction which the mind could not really find a way of verifying or not.<br /><br />In any case this small work does provide a glimpse into the starry heaven and the moral law that Kant wondered at without and within.	2005-03-21

A lonely child never given much affection he wandered the world never really able to make a place home. But when he wandered he thought. And his thought was remarkably original not only in philosophy, but in various sciences including astronomy and physics, and in mathematics. He made major contributions in more than one area including supplying the Cartesian coordinates idea for mathematics. His great achievement according to Strethan is his being the first philosopher to break the stranglehold of Aristotelian thought, and liberate the world to focus on the thinking individual and his subjectivity. In the famous Cogito Ergo Sum Descartes begins by doubting everything and comes to the one certainty which should help him build another system of thought. Strathern makes the point that the Thirty Years War the uncertain times in which he lived made it somehow necessary for him to seek out ' certainty'. From his thinking self he goes to establish the reality of the world, and the reality of God.<br /><br />Descartes a devout Catholic died in Protestant Sweden on a fools error arranged at the whim of a King.	2005-03-20

Machiavelli is seen by Strathern as a wily and subtle man of action and tells the story of his political career well. The turning point comes as it sometimes does in life with a failure. When Machiavelli loses his political position he retires to his Tuscany estate and there writes the masterpiece for which he will be infamous and famous. As Strathern understands him Machiavelli is above all a keen observer of the political world he knew who described what he saw and understood in the Italian Renaissance world of political in- fighting. 'The Prince's is the handbook which tells the Ruler how to maintain his power. And the ruthlessness, lack of Christian sentiment, required is essential to the prescription. Better to be feared than to be loved, though of course desirable to be both. The formula Machiavelli gives for ruling requires ' virtu' which Strathern perhaps incorrectly likens to Nietzsche's will-to-power. Keeping the ruler in power according to Machiavelli also requires other measures such as not relying on mercenaries, and seizing opportunities for compromise as his native Florence failed to do when it might have in doing so preserved its freedom.	2005-03-20

Strathern does not write about Sartre uncritically, but he writes about him with great sympathy and understanding. He retells the story of Sartre's unusual childhood and explains how and why he became a person who always heard the sound of his own drummer. And even the exposition of Sartre as a philosopher illustrates this point, as Sartre continually goes in a way of his own. Moreover the explication of the background to Sartre's major philosophical works is the most clear that I know. He shows how  Husserl's effort to synthesize rationalism and empiricism in his phenomenology provides a take- off point for Sartre in 'Being and Nothingness'. There is also a brief but insightful description of 'Being and Nothingness' and its relation to the work of Heidegger. Strathern stresses that Sartre continually moved despite his radical individualism in the direction of taking responsibility for the world. He may have erred in practical political judgment again and again but he showed a courage in standing up for what he believed in. Strathern also gives us a clue to the famous Sartre- Beauvoir relationship so important to the life and work of both. This through the reading of the orphan Sartre's relation to his mother who was in some ways more sister to him than mother. The Sartre- Beauvoir alliance served them both long after it ceased to be a romantic relationship. Strathern comments that their 'open relationship' was something courageously 'new'for its time- a claim that a few old- fashioned folks like myself might have other terminology for. All in all this is a very fine piece of work. One feels in it Strathern's greater closeness to Sartre than to any other of the philosophers he has written about.	2005-03-20

Strathern gives the background to Machiavelli's political career in strife- ridden Renaissance Italy. He shows how this wily realist made himself useful to the rulers of his native Florence and developed a successful political career. The end of this career sent Machiavelli back to his farm in Tuscany where he then in a few summer months wrote the masterpiece for which he is remembered today. Machiavelli is , Strathern stresses, an observer and describer of political reality. He forgets about the pretences of Christian virtue , and tells a Prince how he must rule if he is to maintain his power. In this Machiavelli stressed that what is required is an utter ruthlessness, a willingness to seize the opportunity and impose one's will. Better for the ruler to be feared than to be loved, though of course best to be loved and fear. The infamous Machiavelli the one hated as immoral was according to Strathern doing nothing more than describing the reality of holding power in political life. The masterpiece did not get Machiavelli the re-entree into political life he wanted. But in time he was appointed historian of the city of Florence and wrote a history of the city which very much followed the lines the rulers of the time wanted. Machiavelli who should not be seen as a fanatic regretted the fact that his city Florence was not wise enough to compromise at the necessary moment with the invading French. This points out that for Machiavelli a certain kind of flexibility, an ability to apprehend the true direction of the situation, and act accordingly were also necessary elements for the 'Prince'.<br /><br />This work does not go deeply into Machiavelli's thought but is excellent as an introduction.	2005-03-20

And it outlines the thought in a brief and clear way. However my own sense is that it is a bit too sympathetic to Marx, and does not emphasize how much disaster and suffering his theories brought upon the world. In the name of the Communism he advocated millions of people were murdered.<br /><br />For Strathern Marx is along with Adam Smith and Keynes one of the great economic thinkers. His understanding of the injustices of  the world of the Industrial Revolution, his understanding of moral failings in Capitalism are often sound ones. Marx however prescribes a cure which is worse than the illness. He dreamed of ' from each according to his ability, and to each according to his need' but this does not come about in the Soviet Union the great testing ground of his work. He too wanted a 'dictatorship of the proletariat 'as preliminary step toward the new order which would come when the capitalist system broke down. Here it seems he is going to wait a long time as it seems capitalism is the least bad of all the systems yet proposed. T	2005-03-20

For Strathern Descartes moved philosophy to attending to real problems of the individual and consciousness. He tells the story of the life of Descartes a life of solitude and wanderings in a lively and at moments moving way. The disconnected Descartes apparently had only one great love in his life, the daughter born to him and a chambermaid he did not marry. The child died at five and this was the most wrenching and difficult experience of Descartes life. Descartes was a remarkable mind whose discoveries and inventions were in a wide variety of scientific, mathematical and philosophical areas. Cartesian coordinates in mathematics and Cartesian reasoning in philosophy are still with us today. According to Strathern Descartes 'reasoning ' was based first on intuition, and then on deduction. His most famous gift to mankind the 'Cogito Ergo Sum' Strathern sees as related to his search for certainty not only because of his own uncertain conditions of life, but because of the uncertain times (Thirty Years War)in which he lived. By trying to doubt everything Descartes makes a move of philosophical courage. In doing so he discovers that one think that he cannot doubt is that he is thinking. And once he has that one firm certainty, he then from there uses reason to get to the reality of the world and the certainty of the existence of God. Bertrand Russell by the way claimed that the cogito shows not that there is a subjective thinker but only that there is 'thinking'.<br /><br />Descartes opened the Western mind to a new way of thought, and soon Leibnitz, Spinoza, Locke, left the Aristotelian world behind.<br /><br />Descartes too was a pioneer astronomer who had to be cautious in publication some of the findings he shared with Galileo because he saw what the Inquisition did to Galileo.<br /><br />Descartes was also a devout Catholic who died in Protestant Sweden after the impulsive young queen called him to her service, and provided a schedule of study for him which led him to get pneumonia and die there.<br /><br />Strathern also touches upon another Descartes contribution his formulation of the body- mind problem , a kind of ghost in the machine formulation which is wholly problematic.<br /><br />Descartes was a great pioneering genius and this small work tells us most of the reasons why.Protestant Sweden after the impulsive young queen called him to her service, and provided a schedule of study for him which led him to get pneumonia and die there.  <br />Strathern also touches upon another Descartes contribution his formulation of the body- mind problem , a kind of ghost in the machine formulation which is wholly problematic.  <br />Descartes was a great pioneering genius and this small work tells us most of the reasons why.	2005-03-20

Wittgenstein as a character fascinates. His principled approach to reality, his mad determination to fight to the end to know the ' truth'are at the heart of the story. The son of one of the wealthiest families in Austria of the thirties his overpowering and dominant father apparently paralyzed Wittgenstein's three brothers and did a good job of helping make him one of the strangest great philosophers of all. Wittgenstein is according to Strathern the only one of the great philosophers aside from Leibniz who had two different total answers to the questions of philosophy. One of the faults of the book is that Strathern does not do justice to the second philosophy that of ' The Philosophical Investigations' which he understands to be a nitpicking kind of wordplaying. And this when he does an excellent job of explaining Wittgenstein's first work ' The Tractatus'.<br /><br />I found one of the most interesting parts of the work to be the story of Wittgenstein's relationship with Russell. How Russell who had attempted to in the ' Principia ' with Whitehead found all Mathematics on the basis of Logic was first corresponded with, then visited, then somehow forced into endless philosophical dialogue with Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein would not leave Russell or the truth alone, and as far as Strathern could discern succeeded eventually in finishing off Russell as a philosopher as he went beyond him.<br /><br />Wittgenstein was a soldier in the first world war and a heroic one. The 'Tractatus' in which he thought he had answered all the problems of philosophy was completed when he was in a prisoner- of -war camp. 'The world is everything that is the case' he begins. And in a series of aphoristic staccato declarations he believes himself to polish off the whole of the Western philosophical tradition. He then retires from philosophy and goes off to be a village schoolteacher where his highly principled approach turns out to be absolutely inappropriate to the simple village children he teaches. He returns to philosophy when he understands that he has not really solved it all. He even reluctantly goes back to Cambridge where he teaches for fifteen years in the style which so entranced many of his devotees. The little room , the long silences, the pained expression, the waiting, and then the eruption of the ' thought'. Strathern says that the only who ever dared to contradict him in these sessions was another brilliant suicidal mind , Turing. In any case out of these probings came the 'Philosophical Investigations ' with its obsession with ordinary language. By the way a bit ironically one of the concepts Wittgenstein developed in that work is that of - family resemblance- which has to do with defining the essence of a concept and understanding that it does not have a simple single essence ordinarily but ' overlapping characteristics ' with a ' family of other concepts' as if were a series of 'Venn diagrams'.That is to say it is doubtful that Strathern or anyone else has defined the ' essence' of Wittgenstein in his particular effort.<br /><br />Another side of Wittgenstein illuminated in the work is his turn to religion, and his mystical connection with the work of Tolstoy and the idea of a kind of holy simplicity. Saint Wittgenstein canonized by his university acolytes aimed perhaps more to be something like Saint Tolstoy who too had a predilection for divesting himself of the family fortune.<br /><br />Wittgenstein, Strathern makes clear was arrogant to the point of insensitivity to the feelings of others. And yet there was something touching childlike in his arrogance, and certainly something great in his determination to think out the problem to the end.<br /><br />He is one of the remarkable originals of philosophy and I think Strathern is correcting in discerning that his work verges on a kind of poetry.<br /><br />It is ironic that so many have tried to follow the example of one who was truly a 'singularity' and a great one at that.<br /><br />One negative moral note. Wittgenstein unfortunately had the habit of interfering in other peoples lives, and ruining them. His arrogance was that he knew for everyone what was best for themselves, understood music better than Mahler and literary criticism better than F.R. Leavis.<br /><br />How strange and paradoxical that God often gives the greatest gifts of genius to those who are not particularly wonderful in their relations with their fellow human beings.<br /><br />Among the Wittgensteinian gems which have become part of common philosophical parlance are :<br /><br /> \\" A philosophical problem has the form.

It forgets to point out the tremendously disastrous effect of Marx's ideas upon mankind. It is here of course possible to say that Marx is not responsible for what the Soviet Union did in his name, or how Lenin and Stalin misused his ideas to enslave and murder millions of people. But as Strathern points out Marx was the philosopher who first said that the' purpose of the world is not to understand it, but to change it.\\" And the way he changed it is what William James would call the ' cash value' of his ideas. And these ideas helped produce untold suffering to Mankind.<br /><br />Strathern also says nothing about Marx's anti- Semitism, and other detestable anti- human elements in his thought.<br /><br />He too writes of Marx's family life in a way which is far more sympathetic than properly deserved. While he was saving the world and living off his friend Engels' remittances his children were often hungry for bread.<br /><br />Thus the familiar story Strathern tells about the evils of the Industrial Age as witnessed by Engels and Marx, the writing of the masterly work, 'The Communist Manifesto' the production of the unreadable economic masterpiece 'Capitol' , the life devoted to the class struggle, the overthrowing of Capitalism, the bringing into being  of ' the dictatorship of the proletariat' as part of the Utopian vision of ' from each according to his ability and to each according to his needs' does not cancel the bottom line conclusion of the ' value ' of Marx's work.<br /><br />A disaster for Mankind is the result of the work of this particular 'genius'.	2005-03-20

He also presents a brief introduction to his thought, analyzing and demolishing some of the key concepts such as 'Ubermensch- Superman' and ' the Eternal Return'. Nietzsche like so many of the great philosophers was orphaned as a child. In his case he lost his father and was raised by a household of women which perhaps explain one very ugly side of his thought, his misogyny. The famous aphorism about women loving to be beaten is truly a black mark on a thinker and person who most likely never beat anyone and in fact whose last sane act outside the loony bin was rushing to kiss in the street a horse that had just been beaten by its master. Strathern conjectures that Nietzsche's syphillis was contracted early and was responsible for the extraordinarily pain- filled life he led. He did not make it to a real love relationship , and his life after he left the university world was largely long walks by himself thinking.<br /><br />Strathern tells the story of the Wagner connection well, and underlines Nietzsche's courage and integrity in breaking with the substitute- father who turned out to be a pathetically bogus half- rate thinker and vicious anti- Semite.<br /><br />Nietzsche understand that systematic philosophy in the Kantian- Hegelian form was dead. His own brilliant works of aphorisms and apercus live in a way the monstrous systematic works do not. Nietzsche is without question one of the great literary stylists of the philosophers and perhaps the most supreme aphorist of all.<br /><br />Strathern does not really go into a major theme of Nietzsche the whole re-evaluation of values, the whole effort to undermine Christian ethics and replace them with an aesthetic of hard demanding excellence and superior powers. Unfortunately the Nietzschean rhetoric is tainted by contempt and arrogance. And the total distortion of his thought wrought on it by his Nazi- sister and heir , and the Nazis themselves mean his misinterpretation contributed to the greatest crimes in human history. This is not a distinction any philosopher would want, and especially Nietzsche who by and large despised the anti- Semites of his own time.<br /><br />The most famous of all of Nietzsche's remarks and parables is of course the 'God is dead' one. The famous graffiti reply,( \\" Nietzsche is dead\\" God) does reflect the truth that we are in a historical period in which return to religion , even fundamentalist religion has seemed to sweep the Nietzschean nay away.<br /><br />As to the lasting significance of the thought of Nietzsche Strathern focuses on the ' will to power' as important contribution. About this I also have my doubts and it seems to me that Nietzsche's place is assured in the history of Western thought, in what might be called the genre of poetic thought- but that there is little of lasting value in the thought itself.

It shows how this master of self- dramatization revolutionized the European world of thought. The first great Romantic the obsessive searcher and promoter of himself was one of the major thinkers leading to the French and then American Revolutions. Orphaned from his mother as a small child he made his way from his native Geneva to the then center of civilization'in Paris. On the way he promoted ideas, ' the pristine  state of nature' ' the corruption brought to mankind by civilization'( Man is born free and is everywhere in chains) ' the centrality of subjective feeling in understanding the world' ' the need for social equality in the education of women' 'the social contract' that changed European mankind's way of thinking about itself. Strathern tells the story of Rousseau's not particularly noble life ( he and his former washerwoman, later wife's five children were put out to foundling homes at infants) including the story of his unusual sexual journey with a great deal of humor and wisdom.<br /><br />This is a  good introduction to one of those truly rare people, one who actually did help change the course of history.	2005-03-20

It is less good as a description of that method of dialogue , the maieutic method of philosophical midwifery by which Socrates attempted to educe the truth about any given concept or subject. Strathern accurately portrays Socrates role as gadfly- teaching the arrogant complacent citizens of Athens that they really did not understand what they thought they understood or know what they thought they knew. He too is good describing Socrates disturbing social role in Athens. He also retells the story of Socrates trial, drinking of the hemlock and becoming the world's first martyr of philosophy. He does not however stress the important point that Socrates took this action out of his sense of loyalty to the polis,his sense of duty as a citizen of Athens. And that therefore the one who had been tried and accused as disloyal to the state, in effect gave his life in a display ( wisely or not)of loyalty to it. And this when the courage and calm in the face of death is too an essential part of the heroic image of the philosopher Socrates leaves to posterity.	2005-03-19

Strathern does provide a good background description of the time, and historical circumstances in which Plato lived. But he does not in my opinion make us truly understand why in Whitehead's famous phrase ' all of Western philosophy is a footnote to Plato'. He does not too when he approaches Plato's masterpience ' The Republic ' show why and how the search for the definition of ' justice' opens the way to understanding all of Plato's thought. He does however make it clear that the gift of Plato to the Western political tradition is a problematic one, as many find in Plato's prescription for a state ruled by a philosopher- king the kernel of the totalitarian dictatorships which were the great nightmares of the twentieth century.<br /><br />I think he also does not make the reader aware of how 'Socratic ' Plato could be about Plato. i.e. how he even in presenting his own as it were ideal vision presents it in a form where it is questioned and made a subject for further doubt and question i.e. if it seems that Socrates asked the questions and Plato gave the answers, this is misleading. Plato also was primarily a provider of questions. It would be Aristotle who would give answers in accordance with the degree of precision he felt appropriate to each field of knowledge.	2005-03-19

Strathern tells the story of Spinoza's lonely struggle to be true to his vision of God and Nature. Strathern writes of  the famous excommunication from the Portugese Jewish community, the humble life of the lens-grinder, the loyal friend ready to take on mobs to protest against the assassination of the politician DeWitt, the supreme rationalist seeing all ' with the eyes of Eternity.' Spinoza who maintained his meditation was the meditation of a free man and so' a meditation on life and not on death' had a pure vision of God as Nature as All-in- All. His appeal to Goethe and English Romanticism came in part from this. His God is All, and yet sublime and impersonal if not like Joyce's paring his fingernails, then certainly not like the Old Testament Hebrew God intervening to prevent Abraham from taking the life of his only beloved son. In other words the God of Spinoza is a God very much of the philosophers, and not one which Pascal a figure of comparable intellectual intensity and aesthetic greatness would have abided.<br /><br />Strathern shows a clear admiration for his subject, and a respect for the subject- matter of his thought. He takes a few jabs, here and there at the great man but not in such a way as to diminish the feeling that we are dealing here one of Mankind's great thinkers.	2005-03-18

The irrevent and very funny Strathern here takes solemn old George Frederich Wilhelm to task for not understanding that Hume had already made the philosophical enterprise impossible. He amusingly chronicles the plodding polymath Hegel's conquest of the kingdom of philosophy as he also fumbles forward and upward in his pursuit of academic place. A tragic note is the story of the orphaned Hegel's relationship with his devoted sister who essentially goes mad in the course of a life in which her brother makes a new connection, with his wife. As for Hegel's elaboration of Kant, and provision of thesis- antithesis- synthesis, the famed dialectic method that Marx would turn the world upside down with, Strathern is thin on illustrating and demonstrating it. For devouted Hegelians of which there are still probably two or three in the Western world this book is probably an insult. For most of us, those who do not think that the History came to its climax with the nineteenth - century Prussian nation- state, for those who do not think that Philosophy and Mind came to their ultimate revelation in the writings of Hegel this small work is a sensible and sane brief evaluation .<br /><br />One more point. Hegel understood that America was the country to watch in the coming century- he aslo understand that Mankind to be understood has to be understood historically- he probably understood a lot else which I, and possibly even Strahern don't. Perhaps Strahern might have done a bit better had he more emphasized what there is of real value in Hegel.	2005-03-18

The hero of Plato's early dialogues the inventor of the famous dialectic, the teacher of the importance of questioning all our assumptions and of knowing what we cannot ultimately know, produced a pupil as great as himself who immortalized him in great dialogues. But he also produced a pupil who had a tendency to System, and gave us his own idea of the Idea- and his own prescription for how Justice must be attained in an Ideal state. Justly or unjustly the Platonic Republic is seen as forerunner of the totalitarian nightmare states of the twentieth century.<br /><br />In this small work there is much concentration on Plato's somewhat incoherent life of wanderings that had its greatest moments in the Academy that he founded  in Athens. .There the attaining of  Knowledge was made the heart of the human enterprise.<br /><br /> Strathern is an outstanding narrator, and a wonderful expositor of philosophical ideas. So it is possible to learn basic Plato from this work. However the complications and contradictions of the work are not really elaborated here. I would have preferred that he tell the story of the development of the Dialogues rather than of Plato's meanderings to Syracause and back. Nonetheless this is like all the works of the series a highly informative and entertaining work.	2005-03-18

I have the feeling that the more interesting the life and character of the philosopher discussed the better the volume. For some reason Hume is for me a very interesting, and admirable character even though religiously I am totally on the other side of the fence. i.e. Strathern claims that Hume is the first philosopher who has the guts to come and say out and out that he is an atheist. I am a person who believes that without God not only I, but all of Humanity is lost.<br /><br />In any case Strathern does a very good job of describing Hume's demolition of the idea of causality(There is sequence, before and after, without necessary connection between them) of continuity of objects, of induction( The fact that there has been night and day, night and day for so long as we know does not necessarily mean that the sun will come up tomorrow). He also does a wonderful job of providing the background to Hume's life in eighteenth century England. Hume whose greatest passion despite him in later years belonging to a group called 'The Eaterei' and being immensely corpulent was for ' literary fame' His first great work 'The Treatise on Human Nature' contained his major ideas but did not bring him the prize he sought.But by the time he wrote an'Enquiry on Human Understanding' he attained it. Also the author of a popular History of England Hume was that rare creature who achieves in his life precisely what he wanted to, and was famed, honored, celebrated and justly so.<br /><br />This short work is a very good account of the life and clear exposition of those ideas, ideas which will make us forever think twice about, whether our world, and we ourselves are ' real 'or not.<br /><br />But of course ' we are' and ' I wrote this review' and someone named 'Paul Strathern wrote a very good book ' about Hume.	2005-03-18

The author captures the Wittgensteinian essence. His narrative of Wittgenstein's life illuminates his character and his philosophy. Wittgenstein as a character fascinates. His principled approach to reality, his mad determination to fight to the end to know the ' truth'are at the heart of the story. The son of one of the wealthiest families in Austria of the thirties his overpowering and dominant father apparently paralyzed Wittgenstein's three brothers and did a good job of helping make him one of the strangest great philosophers of all. Wittgenstein is according to Strathern the only one of the great philosophers aside from Leibniz who had two different total answers to the questions of philosophy. One of the faults of the book is that Strathern does not do justice to the second philosophy that of ' The Philosophical Investigations' which he understands to be a nitpicking kind of wordplaying. And this when he does an excellent job of explaining Wittgenstein's first work ' The Tractatus'.<br /><br />I found one of the most interesting parts of the work to be the story of Wittgenstein's relationship with Russell. How Russell who had attempted to in the ' Principia ' with Whitehead found all Mathematics on the basis of Logic was first corresponded with, then visited, then somehow forced into endless philosophical dialogue with Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein would not leave Russell or the truth alone, and as far as Strathern could discern succeeded eventually in finishing off Russell as a philosopher as he went beyond him.<br /><br />Wittgenstein was a soldier in the first world war and a heroic one. The 'Tractatus' in which he thought he had answered all the problems of philosophy was completed when he was in a prisoner- of -war camp.  'The world is everything that is the case' he begins. And in a series of aphoristic staccato declarations he believes himself to polish off the whole of the Western philosophical tradition. He then retires from philosophy and goes off to be a village schoolteacher where his highly principled approach turns out to be absolutely inappropriate to the simple village children he teaches. He returns to philosophy when he understands that he has not really solved it all. He even reluctantly goes back to Cambridge where he teaches for fifteen years in the style which so entranced many of his devotees. The little room , the long silences, the pained expression, the waiting, and then the eruption of the ' thought'. Strathern says that the only who ever dared to contradict him in these sessions was another brilliant suicidal mind , Turing. In any case out of these probings came the 'Philosophical Investigations ' with its obsession with ordinary language. By the way a bit ironically one of the concepts Wittgenstein developed in that work is that of - family resemblance- which has to do with defining the essence of a concept and understanding that it does not have a simple single essence ordinarily but ' overlapping characteristics ' with a ' family of other concepts' as if were a series of 'Venn diagrams'.That is to say it is doubtful that Strathern or anyone else has defined the ' essence' of Wittgenstein in his particular effort.<br /><br />Another side of Wittgenstein illuminated in the work is his turn to religion, and his mystical connection with the work of Tolstoy and the idea of a kind of holy simplicity. Saint Wittgenstein canonized by his university acolytes aimed perhaps more to be something like Saint Tolstoy who too had a predilection for divesting himself of the family fortune.<br /><br />Wittgenstein, Strathern makes clear was arrogant to the point of insensitivity to the feelings of others. And yet there was something touching childlike in his arrogance, and certainly something great in his determination to think out the problem to the end.<br /><br />He is one of the remarkable originals of philosophy and I think Strathern is correcting in discering that his work verges on a kind of poetry.<br /><br />It is ironic that so many have tried to follow the example of one who was truly a 'singularity' and a great one at that..  <br />It is ironic that so many have tried to follow the example of one who was truly a 'singularity' and a great one at that. <br /> <br />	2005-03-18

His books are dense with words. He is the kind of writer who seems to crowd the page with more and more words, so many words that words sometimes lose their meaning. But not all the time, and not in all of Sartre's work. True there is the famous metaphysical 'Being and Nothingness' with abstract words which mean mostly non- verifiable and non- understandable obfuscations. But there are also the words of ' Nausea' which do touch upon a certain experience, and Sartre's unique defnition of it. So too in this autobiography the words seem to have a meaning at times, a meaning defining a life which is a consciousness, a consciousness reflecting in words upon words. Sartre does have experiences, and a world in which he comes from and a way of seeing, and not seeing things all his own, but most of all he has words and more words. An intellectual and one enamored of his own abstractions he can make words appealing, and he can lose themselves to them so that he is blind to reality as he was in his failure to condemn Stalinism. But he also, and this autobiography shows this was tremendously precocious and a real worker one who produced hundreds and thousands of words about many different subjects including himself.<br /><br />This work is like all Sartre's words wordy , but it has also at times a perceptiveness, an insightfulness an intelligence which makes it for a time anyway, a worthwhile read.	2005-03-17

In this it is possible to learn more from reading a few pages of it than from reading all of Sartre's major philosophical work 'Being and Nothingness'. The basic idea of Sartre's Existensialism is that we are born into the world without having any prior purpose or meaning. Our life is the story of the meaning we make for ourselves. And we do this through our decisions and choices. We make the meaning by our action. And should we decide not to take action then this too is a meaning and action. For Sartre the rejection of all a priori systems most especially those of the great religions leads to the idea of human dignity as based primarily on human freedom and decision.  This is an appealing doctrine in some ways because it would seem to free Mankind of all shackles, liberate it to be itself completely. The problem is that the meaning we make is mortal as we are, and the path of freedom would then seem to lead no matter who we are to an ultimate annihilation and nothingness.<br /><br />We need God if we are to have a meaning that will endure. But this of course would not be acceptable to Sartre.	2005-03-17

Paul Strathern does a wonderful job of summarizing and explicating Rousseau's thought. He does an even better job of telling Rousseau's life story, something he does with intelligence and humor.<br /><br />He sees Rousseau as the real inventor of European Romanticism, the first person who placed the emphasis on making his own inner feeling the center of the world. He traces Rousseau's life from his orphaned- from- his- mother at six childhood to his various adult wanderings from his native Geneva to the corrupt center of civilization Paris, and its suburb Montmercy to England where he is hosted by Hume, and back to Switzerland to Berne. He also outlines Rousseau's major works, and gives a good and clear accounting of the major ideas that Rousseau emphasized in his work. The 'paradisical state of Nature' ' the social contract', the 'man is born free and is everywhere in chains' the dream of a new kind of equality in society( He more than any other thinker fueled the French Revolution that would come only twelve years after his death). For Strathern Rousseau is one of the most influential thinkers Humanity has had. And in the tone of the work there is the sense that Strathern largely approves of the kind of liberation of self and individuality that Rousseau professed. There are of course the shady and questionable sides of Rousseau's life and character, including most notably his abandoning(His longtime companion and the mother of these children Therese Levasseur shared the responsiblity for the abandonment with him) of his five children as infants to a foundling home. And this from the great sympathizer with children who in some sense invented the modern idea of childhood. Despite the paranoia, the intense selfishness and self- centeredness, the ceaseless sponging Rousseau is to Strathern one of the most powerful and important thinkers mankind has had.	2005-03-17

It also makes the major point that Socrates the gadfly punctured the complacency of Athens' respectable citizens, by showing them that they did not understand the basic assumptions of their own thought. The Socratic method of seeking to understand the basic terms and concepts, the basic assumptions underlying the person's position is the great gift of Socrates to Philosophy. In a short work like this Strathern does not touch upon how this key method is recorded and transformed by Plato into great philosophy i.e. how it is through the dialogues of Plato that Socrates largely lives for us. Strathern does give a picture of Socrates manner, habits of life, tell the story of his famous trial, although without explicating this fully either.<br /><br />The questioning, courageous character of Socrates in searching for the truth, and not contenting himself with pleasant delusions is underlined in this fine little work.	2005-03-17

The greatest strength of Strathern's volumes is the lively, humorous and interesting ways he tells the story of the philosopher's life. He does this well also with Nietzsche, though the life became one of lonely walking in the mountains and philosophizing. Strathern is very good on Nietzsche's relation to Wagner, his brief romantic misadventures , his family background, including the early death of his father, and the household of females he was raised by, his poisonous sister and the misuse she made of his literary legacy. He also does away quite quickly with a number of the central notions Nietzsche is most known for i.e. the eternal recurrence, the superman. But Strathern does not really enter into Nietzsche's historical critique of Christianity, his going beyond good and evil, his transformation of values , his attempt to substitute his own ethic for that of the Civilization he judged to fail. I think also Strathern is a bit generous in total freeing of Nietzsche of the responsibility for the deleterious effect of some of his ideas, mainly the 'ubermensch' idea. There is Nietzsche's tone and stance an aggressiveness and verbal violence (His attacks on women are embarassing and shameful) that is not alien to the evil adapters and distorters of his superman doctrine.<br /><br />Strathern has great appreciation for Nietzsche's incredible literary brilliance and psychological perceptiveness. He also notes rightly that in splitting with Wagner, in refusing to sanction the kind of racist anti- Semitism which both Wagner and his own sister preached, Nietzsche showed decency and courage.<br /><br />Another point. Strathern writes about Nietzsche as a readable and interesting philosopher, one who saw system- building as impossible, and yet one whose work has a coherence. I myself believe that there is little of Nietzsche's ' philosophy' that is of enduring value and meaning, but that his writing as a whole is a brilliant literary and philosophical creation in which there is much insight into both the soul and culture. Suffering, syphilitic Nietzsche gave us ' the thought of suicide has gotten me through many a rough night' He also gave us the infamous remark about God's no longer being with us, one which in our time with a worldwide return to and revival of religion seems as Mark Twain said about the announcement of his own death  ' slightly premature'.iting as a whole is a brilliant literary and philosophical creation in which there is much insight into both the soul and culture.

Instead it is rationalist Spinoza seeing God and Nature as one, and the eye of Eternity as looking only one way.i.e. God does not respond to the personal pleas and prays but Nature goes its objective way by its own inherent logic and law. This is Spinoza's view as I understand it and it helped isolate him from the Jewish community of Amsterdam into which he was born. It also made him suspect in the eyes of Dutch authorities in his own time, and he had he not been held back by his landlord twice might have ventured out to the mob and been torn apart as his friend the leading Dutch politican DeWitt was. In this book much emphasis is given to the beauty of Spinoza's thought and its appropriateness for a certain kind of rational scientific inquiry.<br /><br />The real heart of this work however is not in expositing Spinoza's thought ( although it is good when it does, explaining in a few sentences for instance Spinoza's political view , his belief that the state has the duty of allowing individuals to develop in thought to the utmost limit , while having some right to check their dangerous actions) but in telling the story of solitary and heroic life in thought.<br /><br />There are illuminating lines on Spinoza's definition and experience of jealousy, on his inherent caution in understanding how philosophical rivalry might be for him fatal. There is also humor in the writing as when the author tells of Leibniz visiting Spinoza being shown and impressed by the 'Ethics' and immediately going home and ' plagiarizing it'.<br /><br />The work concludes with a small selection of quotations from Spinoza though not in my opinion the finest.<br /><br />My favorite Spinoza lines are ' A free man thinks of nothing less than death, and his meditation is a meditation on life'<br /><br />Strethern says that Spinoza was discouraged by the knowledge that his own great work 'The Ethics 'could not be published in his lifetime. It in fact was published posthumously in the year of his death and went on to make his place in the small group of the very first philosophers.<br /><br />Whether this kind of immortality pleases him in his present heavenly abode , only he and God know.t was published posthumously in the year of his death and went on to make his place in the small group of the very first philosophers.  <br />Whether this kind of immortality pleases him in his present heavenly abode , only he and God know.	2005-03-16

It is written with humor and intelligence, a quick and highly enjoyable read. For Strathern Hume is the first out- and- out self- professed atheist in modernity. For that reason alone I should not like him, but there is something in the character and person of Hume which endeared him to me, as it endeared him to many during his lifetime. He seems to be a decent, fair and humane philosopher . And in writing about his Ethics Strathern makes it clear that Hume was impelled by a strong feeling of human sympathy. The story of his effort to help Rousseau only to be greeted with paranoid accusations on the part of that particular great madman is an illustration of Hume's good nature. But also his many friendships including his very productive one with Adam Smith who he may have helped significantly illustrate this. As for Hume's demolition of our certainty about induction( the sun coming up tomorrow) causality( One thing leading to another, and not just following after it) Strathern provides clear writing about not always easy subjects. His tracing of the fall of our sense of the ' real world' from Descartes to Locke to Berkeley to Hume is classic textbook philosophy but done well. He clearly sees Hume as  a great intellectual hero, and one whose positions are irrefutable to this day. Strathern claims that Hume made 'systematic philosophizing ' an absurdity and then points out that this did not stop Kant and Hegel from going on to build their own monstrous castles in philosophical air. He claims that Hume undermined completely our sense of certainty in the real world, though of course this does not prevent us from taking it as real.<br /><br />This book provides a lot of content in a little space. I recommend it highly.	2005-03-16

And still saying this I have the feeling that this present work however informative and humorous it is in regard to Hegel's life and character, does not really do him<br /><br />justice.<br /><br />I am thinking now of the Hegel of ' the owl of Minerva does not take flight until the shades of night are beginning to draw' i.e. the philosopher of great suggestive power and insight.<br /><br />The dialectic may be as Strathern maintains a method for hiding from reality not discovering it. Hegel too may be rightly criticized for seeing the world historical spirit coming to its apogee in the Prussian state. Hegel too can be criticized for failing to see that there is history after his History, and life which goes on in unexpected ways outside his System of thought. Hegel is presented in this work as plodding professor, professional dullard who works and works himself into being the foremost philosopher of his day. He is also seen as failed awkward poet, and chronic depressive whose search for stability and security led him to the creation of his own absolutist philosophical fortress.<br /><br />This work would have been better had it concentrated more on what is valuable in Hegel's writing and thought- and not simply on criticizing it.	2005-03-16

There are others who by their actions make you on the one hand feel humble and small beside them, but on the other fill you with gratitude that Mankind has such models of greatness. Oliver Sacks in his tremendously powerful intellect, in his passion for knowledge and scientific inquiry, in his human compassion, and in his remarkable writing ability is I think one of the most outstanding human beings on this planet today. His memoir of his childhood years ( from six to fifteen) in London is a celebration of information and insight at once. As a child he is filled with a curiosity about the natural world, and especially about the world of chemisty, and even more especially about 'metals'. He comes from a remarkable extended family filled with interesting characters many of whom have scientific and medical interests. His parents, both of whom are doctors encourage him to inquire and investigate. And he does this and writes of these investigations with a remarkable sensitivity and feeling. It is as if the metals he is investigating, and the experiments he is doing have a kind of sensual life. As a writer Sacks is remarkable in being both scientifically precise and moving in his depiction of human emotions. One center of this work is his relation with his Uncle Tungsten who has a light- bulb factory and who is always investigating new ways of improving the product. Sacks as a youngster is eager to learn, and his uncle takes great pleasure and has great patience in teaching him. But the youngster also learns from others in fact it seems from everyone he meets including his remarkable parents. There an emphasis on the diversity and richness of worlds of learning the family is involved in. But the story is not one of simple one-sided happiness. During the war the six year old Sacks is sent away from the London of the Blitz to a boarding school where he is beaten and tormented. A lonely abused child he later is sent to still another school where he is isolated by his Jewishness. Perhaps these experiences have something to do with the great compassion he will display in his adult career as neurologist, his tremendous capacity to empathize with and understand people, and situations unique and extraordinary. In this memoir the focus is on his learning in the world of chemisty, and there are even sections where he reeducates himself and the reader by considering the work of the great pioneers of this area, including his hero, Sir Humphrey Davy. There is brilliance on each and every page of this work. And as Sacks himself is such an original mind, and such a great writer there is endless delight for the reader here. One small anecdote sticks in my mind. Sacks had an aunt who loved numbers and taught him a lot about how to play with them in his mind. She helped make him understand how mathematics could be a key to reading the physical universe. Sacks then goes on to wonder whether perhaps the mind of God works in numbers. An odd quirky thought but typical of the kind of suggestive insight this work is rich in.<br /> Sacks accompanied his father on house visits , and saw his mother receiving patients all the time. The compassion and care he shows for those he writes about perhaps have their roots here.<br /> Sacks writes often with a surprising humor. He does this in one long section on the family's religious life and his attitude towards it. He found the High Holidays and the Synagogue difficult but had a love for the religious life at home especially on Passover. He writes about the diverse attitudes of family members to various aspects of religion.<br /> Another important element of the work is his discussion of migraines, a condition he shared with his mother. This certainly had something to do with his later becoming a neurologist. He writes humorously of hoping and waiting for a migraine attack so that he could study and examine the new phenomena it would present tohim.<br />In all aspects of life he reveals a great curiosity and human interest. Even when he mocks at something he does so with a kind of gentleness and moderation. A sound sensible and sympathetic spirit.<br />This is a wonderful book by a very great human being.all aspects of life he reveals a great curiosity and human interest.

His interpretative works show not only his tremendous knowledge but his great creative power in thought. This present small volume which is the introduction to a volume published last year the anthology 'The Best Poems of the English Language' I found a bit disappointing. Bloom opens by talking about poetry as figurative language, and then following Kenneth Burke in talking of the tropes which make up figurative language, irony, synecdoche, metonymy, and metaphor. And with this he sets the tone for an essay which is more an eclectic mishmash than it is an insightful look into the heart of reading poetry.<br /><br />He goes on to talk about the importance of allusion in poetry, once again working with his most famous thesis of new poets rivalry with, and their need to overcome their predecessors. He talks about the poetry of thought in Shakespeare, and gives nine poetic passages which illustrate the quality of ' poetic voice'. Toward the end of the volume he makes the general statement that poetry is essentially about expanding the consciousness.<br /><br />I did not find all of this particularly useful in helping me understand how to better read poetry. It seems to me that if Bloom had been true to the title of the work he should have done in this small volume a lot more close reading. And he should have done this about poems which are relatively ' easy' and ' well- known'. And he should too have said something about certain practical steps( for example the importance of memorizing poetry in order to truly make it one's own. The experience of 'knowing and reciting poetry' enhances the art of reading as Bloom himself the memorizer of volumes of poetry well knows).<br /><br />It seems to me too that in this volume Bloom technically straitjackets ' poetry'. Consider for instance the difference between reading the poetry of the Psalms, and reading the poetry of Shakespeare. Consider the difference between reading the poetry of Wordsworth and reading the poetry of Emily Dickinson. There are not simply enormous differences in the content, message, meaning of the poetry but enormous differences in the means of expression and their intent. To read a poet is to somehow feel inside another world. Reading poetry requires above all a kind of emotional empathy that Bloom does not talk about at all. Poetry is after all the deepest way we have of expressing feelings with words. Bloom somehow in this particular work is not interested in that dimension.<br /><br />I also think that Bloom erred in not thinking at all about the way 'poetry ' is ' food for the soul'. I have just been reading Akhmatova and considering the way she was a ' voice for the suffering Russian people' a source of consolation and hope to so many . Poetry I want to say gives a kind of sustenance to mind, heart, and soul. And it is a gift many readers do not know how to appreciate and enjoy, even intelligent readers.<br /><br />I do not believe that this particular work will help those readers very much.<br /><br />And this again when I have enormous respect for Harold Bloom one of the great readers of poetry in our time.ween reading the poetry of Wordsworth and reading the poetry of Emily Dickinson.

It tries instead to give a more complete picture of Descartes interests and activities, with focus on his mathematical physics, and scientific work. There is also a brief telling of the life of Descartes  who Sorrell believes was less isolated than he is usually made out to be. There is one painful detail. Descartes said that the greatest sorrow of his life was the loss when she was only five of his out-of- wedlock daughter.  Descartes religious faith is also discussed. The suggestion however is that of all his work it is the famous 'I think therefore I am' which is most responsible for his continuing fame.	2005-03-14

Drake pictures Galileo as one who understands that Science does not bring absolute truth but closer approximations to truth. He sees the hostility to Galileo as having come not so much from the church as from contempoary philosophers. As the book- jacket states ' in a startling reintepretation of evidence, the hypothesis is here advanced that Galileo in his struggle for freedom of scientific inquiry was mainly concerned not to promote Copernicanism as such, but to prevent responsible theologians from risking the Church's future credibility by taking up a position on any scientific matter at all.\\" So the consquence of Galileo's action was a final parting of the paths of science and philosophy.	2005-03-14

Howard writes sympathetically of Darwin the man and researcher. Aside from the five years on the Beagle expedition Darwin spent all his life in London and in his country home a few miles outside it. Blessed with a long and happy marriage, timid by nature and physically ill for most of his life Darwin used the family wealth ( his mother was from the Wedgewood pottery family) to have time for his researches. Devoted to his family ( He deeply grieved the loss of three of his children) he worked at home putting together  the findings that would revolutionize Mankind's way of thinking not only about the development of the natural world, but of Mankind itself.<br /><br />Howard shows the sources of natural selection in Darwin's close understanding of the  Earth's development through his reading and friendship with the great geologist Lyle, in his adoption of a Malthusian idea of struggle for survival, and in his precise observations of living species and the fossil record. Howard also shows how the idea of evolution through natural selection was championed and brought forward by T.H. Huxley.<br /><br />There are chapters also on ' The evidence for natural selection,' on 'Sex , variation and heredity,' on ' Man'  on 'Perfection and Progress' on 'Darwinism and ideology' and on 'Darwin as a scientist: an evaluation'.<br /><br />Howard attempts in the course of the exposition to refute those who have denied the validity of 'natural selection' and of the ' evolution of species'. His arguments are complicated and not always easy to follow , but seem soundly argued.<br /><br />I believe that this is an excellent introductory work to understanding the main ideas and thrust of Darwin's thought.<br /><br />I would only add a personal note. I am one of those people for whom the findings of Darwin present a deep emotional and religious challenge. The Biblical idea of special creation is at the heart of my own religious belief and conception of human dignity. Along with this there is the basic human need and from my own religion, Judaism's point- of- view religious requirement to seek and know the truth.

He indicates at the outset how diverse and contradictory political and social traditions have adopted Smith and how this father of capitalism was an important source for Marx. He describes the great friendship of David Hume and Smith and their mutual admiration and help. He outlines in detail Smith's moral theory which is based on a unique conception of sympathy, and seeing one's actions as if they were being observed by a host of spectators. But he naturally gives most space and attention to Smith's masterpiece 'The Wealth of Nations' published in 1776 just a couple of weeks after Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall'. Smith's great work was immensely popular from the outset and seemed to provide the most accurate description of economic reality ever attained. It immediately became a basis for government action in encouraging free trade. Smith uses telling analogies and examples in this work to make economic insights many of which are still with us today. Perhaps most memorable is the ' pin' manufacturing example which he shows to illustrate the tremendous advantage of the division of labor. One person making all the pin, or many people making all the pin are far less efficient than when the various steps of pinmaking are broken down and assigned to different workers. 'The Wealth of Nations' also has as a major theme the importance of free trade as a means of increasing the wealth of the nation. And of course its picture of a world in which enabling the the demand and supply of  individuals to operate freely brings about maximum market efficiency. Raphael goes into considerable detail outlining Smith's economic doctrine and the consequences of it.<br /><br />This is a valuable small work and a good introduction to one of the most important economic thinkers.	2005-03-13

Her loyalty to her friends in dark times, and to the other three of the ' four of Russian poetry in this century' (Pasternak Mandelstam Tsetayava ) is also poignantly described.

His 'Lights of Repentance'is a remarkable poetic philosophical work which continually moves and inspires. Rabbi Kook as a poetic thinker is not always easy but there is a general aura about his thought. Part of this comes from the knowledge of his historical role, his great love of the Jewish people his openness to the ' redemptive role' of both secular and religious Jews in building the land and state of Israel.

I am writing this review in March 2005. He says that the United States has already in effect neutralized three of the major countries on the list of seven- terror states given in the book. Afghanistan, and Iraq no longer are terror- states, and Libya has owned up to its nuclear program and abandoned it. Syria and Iran are now at the top of the U.S. agenda. Only yesterday President Bush warned Syria to get out of Lebanon by May. Vallely is like President Bush encouraged by the present calls for democracy in Lebanon, in Egypt. He said perhaps a bit optimistically that Saudi Arabia has begun to change its educational system no longer allowing it to preach the anti- American and anti- Western hatred that brought forth Bin Laden plus.<br /><br />As a side note I would add that Valleley just returned from Falluja in Iraq where he witnessed close - up what he said is now the most terror- free city in that country. He commended the US Marines for their actions in rooting out the terror which had been perpetrated by Iraqis against their fellow Iraqis. I write this because one reviewer on Amazon had chided Valleley for talking about fields of battle he was not close to. Valleley as I understand it did two tours of duty in Vietnam.<br /><br />In any case the authors of this book believe that the US should hit at the state- supporters of Terror. They believe that it is a mistake to talk about a prolonged war upon Terror, and give a blueprint for decisive victory. They are not against diplomatic action and suggest that it must be tried fully .But if it should fail then the suggestion is that the US has the military means to defeat the terror- supporting states .Vallely cites surveys which say the US is very popular among the Iranian people a fact that the mullahs wish to suppress.<br /><br />Vallely's blueprint as I understand it was accurate in predicting swift US victories in Afghanistan and Iraq. And this he now thinks the US made a mistake by not setting up immediately a provisional government. His sense however is that while this may have cost the US nine months to a year the US is winning this war and on its way to victory.<br /><br />My own sense I am reluctant to say is a bit less optimistic. I am troubled at the thought of a Shiite superstate Iran- Iraq - Lebanon which becomes a dominant Mideast power. The Iranians are not about to give up their nuclear program. They have a China and Russian  veto at the Security Council. They have oil money flowing in and support throughout the Islamic third and even European worlds.<br /><br />It seems to me that the Iranian question is the key to the whole war on Terror. Vallely believes that the US can in a matter of days without sending considerable ground - troops defeat Iran, and move it to regime change. It is not however at all clear at the price which would be paid for this especially by US's number one ally in the war against Terror , Israel.<br /><br />Vallely believes the Bush Administration now is on the right course, is more clear about its aims than during the first Bush Administration and is on its way to winning the war against Terror.<br /><br />I think that every human being on earth including those now imprisoned in the ' terror- supporting states' will breathe  freer should the plan of the Endgame be successfully realized.S victories in Afghanistan and Iraq.

It is I believe essential reading not only for those who care about the Jewish people, but for those who care about the face and image of Humanity. Manfred Gerstenfeld, presently Chairman of the Board of Fellows of the Jerusalem Public Affairs Center, has interviewed a number of  scholars and Jewish leaders and presented findings that support the contention that the recent upsurge in European anti- Semitism has strong roots in attitudes and actions in post- war Europe. He has also in the first half of the book provided a remarkable survey essay in which he comprehensively analyzes individual European countries relation to this issue.<br />  As one of the interviewees Professor Yehuda Bauer reminds ,\\" There is something unprecedented, frightening, about the Holocuast of the Jewish people... For the first time in the history of the human race, a decision developed in a modern state.in the midst of a civilized continent, to track down, register, mark, isolate from their surroundings, dispossess, humiliate, concentrate transport and murder every single person of an ethnic group, as defined not by them but by the perpetrators. Not just in the country where the monster arose, not just on the continent the monster first wished to control, but ultimately everywhere on earth, and for purely ideological reasons. There is no precedent for that'. This Holocaust or Shoah (the Biblical Hebrew term for it) involved the murder of over one- third of the Jewish people, approximately six- million people, one - and half million under the age of eighteen, and effectively eliminated or diminished to minimal numbers and significance the great share of European Jewish communities.<br />  The myth or the expectation that Gerstenfeld talks about is that the Europeans somehow learned the lesson of the Shoah, and presented a humane face to the Jews who had survived. In a well- researched and thorough analysis he country- by - country shows how this claim is more myth than actuality. The son of a distinguished Dutch Jewish communal leader Gerstenfeld knows the world of the Netherlands intimately. He exposes the Anne Frank story inspired myth that the Dutch were true protectors of the Jews. In fact the Germans relied on local Dutch personnel to help destroy seventy- four percent of Holland's Jewry, the largest percentage destroyed in any Western country. Gerstenfeld notes that it was Dutch collaborators who in fact turned Anne Frank in and led to her murder.<br />  Another country analyzed closely is Austria whose people so disproportionately were represented among the murderers. \\"Simon Wiesenthal claimed that the Austrians were involved in killing nearly half of the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust. Austrians represented 8% of the German population after the Anschluss; but they comprised 40% of the staff and 75% of the death camps. They were notoriously over-represented in the SS. The Austrian method of systematically robbing the Jews of all their possessions became a model for the German Nazis\\"p.54  The Austrians for years denied any part and responsibility claiming the present regime and people had no connection with their Fascist predecessor.<br />  Germany too, the architect and main perpetrator of the Holocaust has not as many believe made a wholly fundamental change in action and attitude as surveys of anti- Semitism among the population today clearly show.<br />  The stonewalling of various countries and groups in regards to the reparation issue is another major subject in the book. Often this stonewalling is accompanied by an effort to disparage those victims asking for reparations. Gerstenfeld cites the historian Ronald Zweig who shows how Jewish demands for reparations have been an important element in enabling other groups persecuted by the Nazis  to receive compensation.<br />  In the second part of the work David Bankier describes in detail the cool reception Jews were given in post- war Europe. Ephraim Zuroff talks about the way most war- criminals lived long and protected lives untouched by the governments that should have prosecuted them. Yehuda Bauer argues forcefully for education on the Holocaust, and confutes the myth that research on it has been ` completed'. The courageous Deborah Lipstadt talks about the sin of trying to equate other far more minor injustices with the Holocaust. Nathan Durst analyzes the way a Europe psychologically unable to accept its part in the crime, moves toward a new way of blaming the Jews, this time the Israelis. Michael Melchior talks about Israeli government attitudes to a number of Shoah- related issues. Yair Sheleg discusses the often too insular Israeli media's attitude toward the difficulties of Diaspora Jews. Avi Beker destroys some of the myths around the restitution issue.  Isaac Lipschitz shows how Dutch society discriminated against the victims.  Naphtali Lavi in an aptly titled essay 'Fighting for Crumbs' talks about restitution and Eastern European governments.  Laurence Weinbaum talks about post- war Poland and its changing attitudes.  Shmuel Trigano considers post-war France, and Irwin Cotler discusses one of the major  themes of the book, how post- war Anti- Semitism now takes the form of anti- Israel behavior, and how the disease of the extreme Right has become too the ailment of the extreme Left.<br />  This volume was written and published at a time when the `New Anti -Semitism' is gaining ground in the world. The one Jewish state in the world, Israel is now subject to calls for its ` extinction' in something like the way the Nazis called for extinction of the Jewish people as a whole. If the would- be perpetrators now come from the radical Islamic world, and not from Europe it does not mean that European peoples do not have the responsibility to recognize the evils of their past, and stand in the forefront of those defending the Jewish state. That the opposite of this is now occurring and predominant European opinion tacitly supports the new anti- Semitic program is a chilling reminder of how History's evils do not disappear but often take new and horrendous form.phraim Zuroff talks about the way most war- criminals lived long and protected lives untouched by the governments that should have prosecuted them.

Leibniz was as G. MacDonald Ross makes clear a ' polymath' not simply in the sense that he had knowledge in a wide variety of areas, but rather in that he sought to make out of this knowledge a comprehensive and deep understanding of the world. He too was the subject in Voltaire's Candide and in Swift's Gulliver of much ridicule, the man of vast schemes and optimism who could be chided for not really knowing what practical, common sense, everyday life was about. But he was not so ' simple-minded' as his satirical critics make him.<br /><br />In fact his search for knowledge led him into dialogue with the most distinguished minds of his time. His vast correspondance fifteen- thousand letters was according to him the real abode of his wisdom and knowledge even more so than his books. Because of his diverse interests he somehow rarely completed anything including the many technical projects he worked on. His contributions to mathematics,and logic, to metaphysics and science are each given separate chapters in this work. His interests however extended into law, politics, religion, and also some of the pseudo- sciences such as alchemy. A civil-servant in the court of Hanover, living under the protection of patrons he was often accussed of ' working at everything but that which he was paid to work for'. He was the intimate of royalty and a consulted expert in the whole subject of 'dynastic succession'. In this biography we get no sense whatsoever of whether he cared for personal or family life in any way, though we do learn that his sole- heir was his sister's son. Leibniz only a small part of whose writings have been translated into English is considered one of the great universal geniuses of mankind. But he is also mocked as being a ' pure rationalist' whose emphasis on the life of the mind made him a bit less than human.<br /><br />This is a rich little book. One detail of it intrigues me especially. On one of his trips home Leibniz stopped in Holland and there had four days in intense conversation with the lens- grinder Spinoza.<br /><br />How many of us would like to hear how the monads sounded when seen from the eyes of Eternity.is trips home Leibniz stopped in Holland and there had four days in intense conversation with the lens- grinder Spinoza.  <br />How many of us would like to hear how the monads sounded when seen from the eyes of Eternity.	2005-03-08

In this work he admits to being no mystic examines accounts from a wide variety of traditions and comes up with eleven characteristics of Mysticism. As I am no mystic myself I have difficulty judging the validity of what he has done. I can say that this work is filled with insightful remarks.<br /><br /> The eleven quintessences of the mystical state as Scharfstein defines and calls them are :\\" sameness; separation; uniqueness;inclusion;familar strangeness;depletion;aggression; conscience; mirror-rversal; humor; Reality, as the critical characteristic is put last. To a mystic, it may seem to be the only one worth emphasizing, but he inclined , after all , to dismiss many of the more interesting features of his experience, his own no less than ours.\\"<br /><br />I suggest the reader make an effort to understand each of these quintessences, something I did not really manage.<br /><br />Despite Scharfstein 's rigor in analysis, I still am mystified about mysticism-  perhaps indicating that in this realm of experience as with so many others if one has not experienced it for oneself one simply cannot really understand it.	2005-03-07

And in fact I believe there are a few more British names on the list than there should be . This does not really damage the excellency of this  series as a whole, but it does show that the Oxford Press British too are capable of a bit of intellectual chauvinism.<br />As for Wyclif I found that this little book was extremely difficult to read, and spend much of its time on very hard and minor philosophical problems. Wyclif's great distinction after all is not his philosophy but his taking a courageous stance against the wealth and corruption of the medieval Church, and his daring to confront the Papacy. Along with this his great contribution is his translation(the first)  of the Bible into English.<br />This work tells his story, his main accomplishments and perhaps gives a bit more of his philosophy than we need to hear about today.	2005-03-07

In it 4002 outstanding individuals are selected through surveying the encylopedias, biographical dictionaries and other Literature in the respective fields. Murray attempts to compile a collective resume of those chosen of the chosen, who have made lasting and memorable contributions to the sciences and arts. Behind this is the conception that these are the true heroes of Mankind, the single individuals  who as Buckminster Fuller used to say, do more significant work for the masses of mankind than they taken together can do for themselves.<br /><br /> This project involved a prodigious amount of research, and is without question a worthwhjle and even noble undertaking. But it despite the disclaimers skewed in its own way, and lacking in the texture and feeling of the very kind of thing it admires most i.e. very great creative work.<br /><br />Nonetheless it contains a wealth of information, and perhaps more importantly interesting thought about the whole question of cultural and scientific creativity.<br /><br />The categories of creativity and accomplishment he chooses in themselves leave something to be desired.  They are as follows: Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Physics, Mathematics, Medicine, Technology, Combined Sciences, Chinese Philosophy, Indian Philosophy, Western Philosophy, Western Music, Chinese Painting, Japanese Art, Western Art, Arabic Literature, Chinese Literature, Indian Literature, Japanese Literature, Western Literature.<br /><br />It is quite easy to accept Murray's exclusion of great General and Warriors as principal creators of Mankind, although there certainly is an argument on the other side. But consider what he is left out. He apologizes for leaving out Commerce and Law. But he also leaves out Politics. I think most of us feel that there are a few political leaders, say Lincoln or Pericles or Churchill who deserve to be cited as among those having made major human accomplishments. Consider another omitted category, one most influential to the great mass of mankind, Religion. There are no prophets of Israel on his list, nor is there Jesus or Buddha . There is another kind of fault. With all due respect it does not seem to me that Chinese philosophy should have the same number  of distinguished people as Western philosophy, any more than Japanese or Arabic Literature should have the same number of great creators as Western Literature. The truth (ethnocentric , or not)  is that Western Literature has many more creators at the highest levels of complexity and beauty than do these other literatures. It is to me extremely odd that Murray has no place on his list for the single religious and literary work that has had greatest influence on Mankind, the Bible.<br /><br /> Murray also deliberately excludes the creative world from which he himself comes, social sciences, and scholarship. In other words it seems to me that Murray would have been fairer had he been a bit more modest, and made it clear that his survey of human accomplishment is confined to certain areas only, and thus partial and limited.<br /><br />Despite this Murray has done in the areas he has studied a very credible job. He shows how in almost every area of creation there are two or three figures who stand far above the rest in the opinion of Mankind. In Western music it is Mozart and Beethoven with Bach close beside. In Western Art history Michelangelo looms above all but with Picasso , Raphael beside . Behind them are Leonardo and Titian. In Western Literature it is Shakespeare who Murray  taking a page perhaps out of Harold Bloom , sees as the outstanding creator in all categories. Shakespeare in Literature is followed by Goethe and Dante. And here I would say even this small sampling shows that a problem Murray tries very hard to deal with, a problem of taking `quantity'( of references and mentions)for ` quality' is not easily soluble. My own taste tells me that Tolstoy leaves in sheer creative power and complexity Goethe far behind, and that Picasso has no place being in the same list with Michelangelo and Leonardo. Yet I agree with Murray's major point that in the great majority of cases there is a clear human consensus . If Einstein and Newton stand on the top of the Physics list towering above all others this certainly makes sense to us. So too I suppose do Darwin and Aristotle at the top of the Biology list.<br /><br />Murray takes a yeoman- like job in compiling the lists of great and outstanding creators and analyzing those lists. The book has a tremendous richness in this. It talks about questions such as why there are women are so underrepresented on the lists, why dead white males so overrepresented, why Europeans are too so overrepresented,  why Ashkenasi Jews are at a time so over- represented. It talks about the acceleration in creative accomplishment especially in scientific areas as we approach the present. And in his introduction Murray explains why he has stopped at 1950, this partly because  it takes time to weed those who will stay out, and partly because of his doubts about the value of the artistic and literary contributions of the latter part of the twentieth century.<br /><br />But I think that Murray's major point and the heart of his contribution is in again reaffirming the idea that there are great individuals, that they do create in miraculous and what may seem to us, unbelievable ways and that all of us should be in their debt.<br /><br />In illustrating this point so well, Murray suggests that the human enterprise has a dimension of heroism in creative work that should give us all consolation, inspiration and hope.<br /><br />I have touched upon only a few of the themes that Murray considers in this tremendously interesting and thought- provoking work.<br /><br />All concerned with the human creative enterprise should have this volume in their library.taste tells me that Tolstoy leaves in sheer creative power and complexity Goethe far behind, and that Picasso has no place being in the same list with Michelangelo and Leonardo.

He says that the wealth of the modern world has greatly benefited the study of Art. He indicates that there have been more fine art history books published in the past forty years than in all previous history. He says that the appreciation of Art is part of the lives of far more people than ever before. He only regrets that there has been a decline in the quality of the training of fledgling artists, and there is not the teaching of drawing and painting technique in the way there once was. But he speaks enthusiastically, optimistically about the future of Art and its appreciation.<br /><br />And this though he clearly in this History shows such little sympathy for ' modern art' and gives the impression that for him Art pretty much stopped developing close to a century ago.<br /><br />As a number of reviewers have said this History of Art does not have the objective authority of Gombrich's or Janson's histories. It has the idiosyncratic and often highly interesting taste and judgment of Johnson behind it. One reviewer mentioned the short shrift he gives to the Impressionists. I looked with vain with one mention of the work of a great favorite of mine, Chagall. Yet Johnson writes with enthusiasm about many neglected corners of Art, and gives new relevance to artists ordinarily neglected. His knowledge and passion are great, and so there are treasures of insight on each page. Johnson can be 'off' as he was in the ranting he did in his book on 'Intellectuals' but he usually is forceful and insightful. In this History his great knowledge and love set the tone, and he provides an intellectual feast of very high quality.	2005-03-06

He is a first- rate journalist and he has a real eye for the battlefield and ear for those who were able to tell their stories of what happened. I have done research on an important figure in the whole story Rabbi Shlomo Goren, and paid special attention to Rabinovitch's account of Rabbi Goren on that day. It was moving, and dramatic, and caught the spirit of the time.<br /><br />The whole story, the threat to Israel before the 67 war, the build- up of tension with the long - waiting period, the great fear that another Holocaust might be on the way, - all this followed by the dramatic turnaround the startling unexpected victory which had as its penultimate stage the taking and retaking of Jerusalem is chronicled here.<br /><br />The fact is that there would not have been a battle for Jerusalem had not the Jordanians attacked.

We often hear about those great people little known in their own lifetime who like Emily Dickinson, Van Gogh, Kafka become great in the world only after having left it. Morris is it seems to me an example of a far more numerous type, those whose standing and position in their own day is far greater than it will be for posterity.<br />Morris was a central figure in Victorian English life, as political  activist, as writer on social issues, as romance writer, as planner , and design-expert. He fought against what he saw as the social justices and esthetic ugliness of his age. He was a founder and  leading of the British labor movement, an important socialist thinker.His concern for the quality of life for all people was genuine, and he was active in pursing his goals. None of his literary works however are widely read today, and few turn to him when they think to discuss social issues.<br />Stansky in this fine work summarizes his aims in this way.\\" He wished to reform the world, to simply life, to make it more rewarding, to make it more beautiful, to make it more just,to make the joy of it available to more and more people, to fight against shoddy, to remove 'mumbo-jumbo' frim the world.These conceptions are stronger for us because of his ideas: he ws central in changing our vision of the world.

In the first and most accessible chapter Kenny talks about Aquinas life and influence. In the second chapter he writes about an aspect of Aquinas thought he considers to be overestimated, his theory of 'Being'. And in the third he writes on another aspect of Aquinas thought he considers to be undervalued, his theory of ' Mind'. These last two chapters are quite difficult going, and are suitable for those who are willing to deal with ' hard and tough thinking'.<br /><br />I did not find this to be one of the most interesting of 'The Past Masters' series works of which I have read many. I did however learn quite a bit about Aquinas including some of the legendary material. Against his family's will he became a Dominican . He was the most brilliant pupil of Albertus Magnus. In the' 'Summa' his method is to begin with the three most difficult objections to the religious claim he makes and then refute them all in one comprehensive answer. He was recognized in his own lifetime but it was only with the centuries that his thought became the central teaching of the Catholic Church on many matters.<br /><br />Kenny claims the relative lack of interest in his philosophy today comes in part because it is in Latin, and in part because Philosophy today has different issues and vocabulary. His claim in this sense is that Aquinas is not appreciated as well as he should be today.	2005-03-04

It has chapters on Plato's 'Life and times, on 'His forbearers, a chapter on' How Plato became a philosopher' one on ' Understanding Plato'  one on 'Knowing Things' on 'Definition, dialectic and the good,' on 'Education and the Good Life'  on' The Divided Mind'  on 'The Authoritarian State' on 'Plato's achievement'. Hare apologizes for not having had the space to really consider Plato's views on Art, and on Love.<br /><br />I found especially interesting his background description of the Greek world of Plato's time, and their attitude toward 'power' and 'violence'. This background really helps the reader understand Plato's search for a kind of ideal social order. And this when his absolutist solution is of course strongly rejected by the Western liberal democratic political tradition.<br /><br />Many of us first learned our Plato with Whitehead's famous remark that all Western philosophy is a footnote to him. Hare does do a bit toward showing how Plato is at the foundation of many philosophical dilemnas , metaphysical , ethical and political which still concern us today.<br /><br />He also provides a brief description and  periodization of the Dialogues.<br /><br />What is missing from the work is the feeling of the Platonic dialogues themselves.

He invokes the biographical memoir of a contemporary and friend of Spinoza, Colerus. Scruton says \\" From this we learn of the simplicity and naturalness of Spinoza's life and character, and of the high esteem in which he was held by acquaintances and friends. The seclusion of Spinoza's life was necessitated by intense labour and intellectual discipline , and his frugality expressed independence of spirit rather than meanness of self- concern.\\"<br /><br />Scruton speaks of the magnificence and ambition of the last great Latin masterpiece, Spinoza's 'Ethics'. He has chapters on Spinoza's view of God, of Man, of Freedom,and one on his legacy.<br /><br />This is a rich work from which much can be learned. As Scruton says for Spinoza \\"scientific objectivity and divine worship \\" are the two forms of freedom.<br /><br />Spinoza for Will Durant was the one philosopher who lived as he wrote. This short work gives evidence of this congruence between work and life.	2005-03-03

He was at one time the star of European and world- philosophy but the star has dimmed with the years. He was born Jewish but was a convert to Catholicism. When the Nazis ordered the Jews of Paris to line up to receive the yellow- star Bergson( who could have been exempted by his Catholicism and his fame)got out into the street with his fellow Jews. He stood in the cold for hours.Old and unwell he died shortly thereafter.  <br />His philosophy was a philosophy whose emphasis was on ' lived experience,' on the time of 'duree'' on the inner sense we have in being alive .For him as for his American correspondent William James life was a creative stream. And newness and innovation came naturally with it. It was almost as if for him creation ex nihilo occurred in every instant. He opposed in his thought mechanical thinking, rigid determinism.  <br />I myself have always found grasping his thought very difficult, and this is still true despite Kolakowski's excellent work. I do however believe many of the themes of his thought, and especially those related to the inherent creative quality of humanity are ones which are true and deserve a lasting place in our understanding and definition of ourselves and the world.	2005-03-03

Aviezer is ingenious and does a  truly credible job in connecting the Biblical story of creation with science's most recent findings about the physical world. For those whose tendency in thought is to look for confirmation of their religious belief in this way this is truly an excellent work.<br /><br />I would however say that I am one of those who tend to see this kind of effort as more metaphorical and marginal than central to religious faith. For me Tannach( the Bible) is not a scientific guide to the universe, a more primitive primary source to what Mankind would later confirm through scientific research but rather the prime religious revelation, the document that teaches us how to live morally, and do G-d's servince in the world. Of course in the Jewish tradition this means also making the interpretation of Tannach through the Oral Torah. But that is another matter.<br /><br />The point again is this is a rich work by a scientist who really knows his stuff and a religious Jew who is learned and wise. If this approach is the one the reader finds useful for them I highly recommend this work.	2005-03-02

Du Pre who died tragically young was a cellist at the highest level. Her marriage to the conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim , and their musical friendship with Zubin Mehta, Pinhas Zukerman and others put her in the center of the music world's attention .This book tells the story of her life but somehow does not give us a sense of who she most deeply was . The legend tells of her beauty and her genius and her tragic death. And the brother and sister seem fair in describing their own complicated relationship with her in which they often played a fostering and supportive role. Perhaps the real inner life of Du Pre is not to be sought in the kind of biographical work written here, or for that matter in any literary work, but in the playing in her recordings where she was most alive. In one passage of the book she does speak about the way playing takes her above into another realm of joy. And by all accounts she was a  tremendously passionate and powerful cellist. There are even critics who say that she played more of herself, than she did of the score before her. And that in repertoire she was not broad and innovative enough. In any case it seems universally agreed by musical cognescenti that she at her best was at the very highest level. I am no great maven here but I too can admit to being quite moved at the hearing of her playing of the Elgar Cello Concerto.<br /><br />The story of her marriage to Barenboim, their whirlwind life, its break- up is also told here in a very concise and limited form. Barenboim the bon vivant, the tireless promoter and player somehow may have been a bit too fast for the English country girl who according to her sister needed nine hours of sleep and not the four or five Barenboim did. In any case this part of the book is devastatingly sad as of course is the end.<br /><br />The brother Piers and the sister Hilary who wrote this book truly cared for and tried to help their sister.

The Arendt of 'The Origins of Tolitarianism' and of 'The Human Condition' brings a tremendous power of thought to the analysis of phenomena of the real world. In this work there is primarily ' thinking about thinking' and the connection with historical realities, individual personalities is not central. Therefore the reading of the work it seems to me becomes more an exercise in that metaphysical abstract never- never land where nothing can be firmly affirmed or falsified.<br /><br />It thus seems to me that this text is best read as a kind of poetic inspirational work, that does provide understanding and insight into thinking and the world of the mind, but which does not fundamentally provide ' truth'. My guess is Arendt would greatly object to this definition of her enterprise. And my sense is that in this work what she was really trying to do is make her bid to be among those system- producers who stand at the center of the long philosophical tradition in the West.<br /><br />I say this when I myself find Arendt an exalted and inspiring thinker, one who inspires me to thought of my own. I will just bring one passage, in my opinion, a key one from the work so that the reader can have a feel of what she is doing.<br /><br />\\"If thinking is an activity that is its own end and if the only adequate metaphor for it, drawn from our ordinary sense experience, is the sensation of being alive, then it follows that all questions concerning the aim or purpose of thinking are as unaswerable as questions about the aim or purpose of life.\\"	2005-03-02

There is not the qualified, parenthetical and always somehow self - protective, enigmatic and ironic Kafkean voice but instead simple and direct proclamations, statements , generalizations made clearly and without hesitation. Now it may well be that Kafka the older man spoke to his much younger student- admirer Janouch in this way. Rare I suspect were the occasions when Kafka the perpetual son who never married, had no children of his own could take on the role of a kind of senior wiseman. Janouch is cordial and ready to listen to the great man. And in truth I greatly enjoyed many of the pronouncements which had something of Kafka in them, but did not strike somehow because of the tone as authentically Kafkian( not in this case Kafkaesque).<br /><br />For instance in talking about Poe and his escape into dream , Kafka defends him but warns, \\" Imagination only served him as a crutch.He wrote tales of mystery to make himself at home in the world. That's perfectly natural. Imagination has fewer pitfalls than Reality.\\"<br /><br />Or in another instance when Janouch and him meet Kafka's father and the father treats him like a schoolboy and sends him off to home. Kafka defends his father to Janouch with the words, \\" Love often takes the form of violence.\\"<br /><br />Or in another instance when they are talking of youth and aging, Kafka says one- dimensionally and definitely. \\" Youth is happy because it has the ability to see Beauty\\"<br /><br />This work is full of such gems , bits of Kafka's talk which we the readers who for one reason or another consider ourselves ' admirers ' of take pleasure in adding to the bits of knowledge we have about him. And this almost as if by knowing a bit more about him when we might somehow rescue him and provide him a bit longer and better life than the one he actually had.<br /><br />For he , the jackdaw ( He in the book by the way talks about the name 'Kafka ' which means ' jackdaw'and relates himself to this not particularly attractive and solitary bird)has given his readers so so much in literature that we would in some way repay him for his gift.<br /><br />Jannouch's book may not be completely accurate and authentic. But it is a real contribution to our knowledge of Kafka. It gives us a bit more story, anecdote and statement to add to the legend.

There are however all kinds of factors continually changing the room- temperature. We have  a means of measuring the temperature continually and making readjustments to keep it steady. The feedback, the report on what is 'happening now in the system'  enables us to alter the system to produce the ideal result that we want. This feedback enables us to pilot the system as we want it , and keep it under our control.<br /><br />So much for the thermostat, feedback, and I believe the basic idea of Norbert Weiner's communications- control world.<br /><br />But what happens when the ideal result is not agreed upon at the outset? And what happens when the ' measuring' of the system is not a non- ambiguous straightforward matter?<br /><br />Is it possible that human affairs are so complicated, so informed by what Isaiah Berlin might call 'competing and conflicting ideal ends and values', that a model for their development based on a simple physical analogy is not appropriate? and this even though that model is presented by a very great genius?	2005-03-02

The first and great impulse of Aristotle is the desire to know and Barnes makes it clear how Aristotle for over one- thousand years was ' the master of all those who know'. He seemed to take interest in every area of study, and his researches in the physical world were for centuries at the forefront of human knowledge. Barnes makes it clear that the Aristotelian view of the world scientifically was ' exploded' by the scientific revolution. No one teaches Aristotle's biology or physics today, and no one uses his methods. On the other hand in other areas, such as ethics and aesthetics his ideas still have a power and voice. The love of knowledge in Aristotle as Barnes makes clear was combined with his understanding of the human being as ' social animals'. Therefore no matter how high a value he placed on the contemplative life ( and this as the key to eudaemonia or happiness in Aristotle's thought) he understand the social, and political aspect of life as human necessity. Barnes outlines Aristotle's political theory, his perhaps too optimistic a view of the role of the state, his exclusion of whole human groups which we today consider rightfully entitled to participate in the ruling of society.<br /><br />Barnes too makes an interesting analysis of the written style of Aristotle's work, taking it to be dry, factual, and without the poetic and imaginative elegance of Aristotle's great teacher, Plato. He shows how for Aristotle the chief value is in the transmitting of knowledge and that language is thus treated not as an end in itself, but as instrument.<br /><br />One cannot help noting the great irony in Aristotle's story. He who loved knowledge so much and was so devoted to its accumulation and dissemination, nonetheless fostered countless misconceptions. There are many who believe his Physics held Mankind back for generations.<br /><br />Nonetheless taken all in all , aside from his enormous historical role, Aristotle stands as a figure a great example of one fundamental human value , the quest for and love of knowledge and learning.<br /><br />Barnes makes it clear that we have much to learn from him still.ken all in all , aside from his enormous historical role, Aristotle stands as a figure a great example of one fundamental human value , the quest for and love of knowledge and learning.  <br />Barnes makes it clear that we have much to learn from him still.	2005-03-02

One of my strong impressions and surprises was in learning that Bacall is from a Rumanian Jewish family and grew up in the Bronx. In the Bogart movies I saw her in I had seen her as an elegant seductress of mysterious and exotic background. In the book she reveals herself to be down- to- earth and smart, also very ambitious and open to the main chance. Her relationship with Bogart came at the price of his previous marriage. She seems by her own account anyway a very devoted mother and a quite decent person. The book itself is a usual kind of filmstar bio with its anecdotes and gossip about the famous. It does not have distinctive style or great humor or anything which would make it rise above being the standard kind of thing it is.<br /><br />Bacall is a good actress and has continued at it through the years, but the kind of lanky beauty and sensuality she had in youth was naturally lost with the years- and with it in my opinion what was most appealing about her. The book does give insights into Bogie and his fans can learn something about him here.<br /><br />I would just add a personal word. This kind of reading always feels to me somewhat immoral. The interest is not pure, but rather in digging into the dirt especially the sexual dirt about the person involved. I invariably in reading such books feel badly afterward. (Hemingway said an action is moral if one feels good after it.) So my own puritanical self did not really take great pleasure in reading this work. And I by the way doubt I will do very much of this kind of ' cheap reading' in the future.	2005-03-01

There is much to be said about Yeshayahu Leibowitz. A tremendously learned and sharp- minded person , a scientific gadfly who seemed to kowtow to no authority, famous for daring to defy Ben- Gurion, a Jewish philosopher of importance, and a loveable curmudgeon whose anger and definiteness in speech had something delightful and playful about them. At the left - wing of Israeli politics he became the hero of secular 'peace-now' like people for his harsh criticism of Israeli government policy vis - a - vis the Palestinian Arabs. While his politics were not to my taste I had and have a genuine respect for his learning, and integrity. I think however that he made one critical mistake, one curse which went to far. I won't recall it but I will say it does to my mind , undermine his moral authority, and make his Biblical interpretation and Jewish philosophy less praiseworthy.<br />I remember watching on television many of the talks included in this collection. Leibowitz was always definite and sure in his opinions ( the Hebrew word 'paskani' really describes it best) I think his conception of the Jewish religion however was quite narrow. And the notion which he taught at every turn that the Halachic Jew's task is to simply hear and obey, without questioning or understanding always struck me as in total opposition to what other commentators said and the Oral Tradition demands. In any case anyone who reads this work will find insights of a first- rate mind a bit too much given to believing that what he and only he says has to be the only thing which is right.	2005-03-01

The Beatrice Dante falls in love with and longs for is on the one hand a figure unattainable, the love- goddess of courtly love. On the other hand she is to become the very essence of the spiritual and to guide Dante later through the Paradiso of the Comedy. The real figure and her life who he falls in love with truly is transformed in myth and mind to a kind of image and essence of Divine Beauty.<br />As with Petrarch and his Laura the love Dante writes of ' La Vita Nuova' does not somehow strike me and move me in the deepest way, and seems somehow too literary and artificial. Lines of love of Rilke and Kafka sound more authentic to me, but perhaps this is because I am a  poor reader and no medievalist.<br />In any case this is a small classic which is prelude to a far greater one.

They contain notes of the kind the writer makes for himself in preparing a work, small observations, little incidents from his experience. I imagine that if one is a fan of Greene's sensibility these journals might be more interesting than I found them to be.

Rilke truly considers his young correspondent, his verses, and tries to genuinely help him. But what he does in the course of doing so is reveal his own poetic credo and mission. And this poetic mission involves a deepening inward, a dedication to the creative process which is total, and a vision of life as enfolding creation organically. Rilke expresses his loneliness and special understanding of life in these letters. He does this in a language which is a kind of poetic prose in his own unique voice.<br /><br />Some advice:<br /><br />\\"Consider yourself and your feeling right every time with regard to every such argumentation, discussion or introduction; if you are wrong after all, the natural growth of your own inner life will lead you slowly and with time to other insights.

I do not believe however that Hume in the work really considers two other major arguments for belief in God. One argument might be called the existensial - personal decision argument , in which the individual out of his own need and will decides for belief in God. This decision can be a rational calculation as Pascal suggests that we should make in order to give our own immortality a chance, or it can be a profound deeply moving conviction something that grows out of our own deepest being and need. Another path to belief in God is through the kinds of mystical experience that thousands of human beings from all cultures have had. William James collects some of these testimonies in 'The Variety of Religious Experience'. Another path is through the path of accepting the Tradition given us by our ancestors.<br /><br />Now it might be said that these alternative paths to belief in God do not deal with the kind of ' proofs ' Hume is talking about. Hume is really talking about the ' rational way' to God through mind and reason. But I believe that every reader should have these other ways to God in mind , if only not to be devastingly shattered by Hume 's demolition job of the Design Argument.<br /><br />It is well to remember that there are other ways to God aside from the ones spoken of and questioned here.<br /><br />I write this as a believer in God who also believes that a very great share of Mankind needs God, needs the belief in God to make their own lives ultimately meaningful. And this when I would also keep in mind the following idea. If the Proof of God were certain and absolute , then there would be no test/ trial / challenge for humanity in its belief in God.<br /><br />And here I add the idea central in the Jewish tradition, and probably important in others, that God wants our decision for God, our free choice of God, and not a slavish obedience even to an airtight logical principle.dd the idea central in the Jewish tradition, and probably important in others, that God wants our decision for God, our free choice of God, and not a slavish obedience even to an airtight logical principle.	2005-02-27

Jacobs is a great scholar with a mastery of the traditional literature. And one of the special features of the work is the considerable bibliography he gives on each of the more than twenty chapters he writes about.<br /><br />In his introduction he explains that for Rambam theology is ' the science of God' and that this science is one which many have regarded as alien to Judaism. He discusses the difficulty of definining and limiting God, and again turns to Rambam in his teaching that we study theology not in order to know what we can say about God, but in order to know what  should not be said about God.<br /><br />Jacobs talks about the different ways of coming to believe in God, 1) through the traditional proofs, or by reason 2)through direct mystical experience 3) By existensial decision 4) Through tradition and the acceptance of it.<br /><br />In his chapters he writes about ,  the unity of God; transcendence and immanence; omnipotence and omniscience; providence; the love and the fear of God; the nature of revelation; Torah and mitzvah; sin and repentance; the Messianic hope; and the afterlife.<br /><br />His presentation is balanced and thorough.<br /><br />This is a book to not only be read but to be learned and studied.<br /><br />I myself intend to reread it as I understand it has a wealth of ideas and insights that can hopefully help me understand how to better serve God.	2005-02-27

Hume's questioning of induction, of how we can be sure tomorrow will be like today , his questioning of how we can trust our senses to know the outside world, his questioning of how we can hold our world logically together when analysis reveals that there is no necessary connection between ' cause' and 'effect' in everyday life action means he wakened not only Kant from his dogmatic slumber but Philosophy itself from the sense that it will provide absolute understanding.<br /><br />Hume is a very clear writer. I remember reading the famous billiard ball account of causality in which our common sense view of ' before' and ' after' is questioned and taken apart. I believe Hume says after this account, something to the effect and ' still when we leave the room we leave by the door and not by the window'. A friend of mine in this class when the class ended opened the window ( on the ground floor ) and went out that way.<br /><br />This is difficult and great philosophy. I do not pretend to understand it or its implications fully. A test of the mind and a necessary read for anyone who would know Western Philosophy.	2005-02-27

The old man who he describes being thrown stones at by children on his way to his studio where he worked and worked, and only worked from the time he found his vocation at the age of thirty, is the example to Rilke of the totally dedicated artist. This artist has that kind of patience which slowly lets his work enfold, layer upon layer. In this as always with Rilke remarkably beautiful and haunting collection of letters he tells of his encounter with the work of Cezanne and how the true artist brings into fuller being the object he sees and creates. Rilke is quoted in the introduction as he talks of \\" the scales of an infinitely responsive conscience.. which so incorruptibly reduced a reality to its color content that that reality resumed a new existence in a beyond of color, without any previous memories\\".<br /><br />This statement so suggestive is typical of the Rilkean text which seems like poetry itself to offer more meanings than any single reading can grasp.<br /><br />My brief remarks comment upon a few of those suggestions. I believe readers of this work will be inspired to seeing , reading, and in their own minds through the reading, creating of their own on a higher level.	2005-02-27

It was taken to be the holy text that gave the true answers to the philosophical puzzles that graduate students in philosophy were puzzling over. Wittgenstein was the hero and his manner of ' doing philosophy' of walking and holding his forehead, and waiting in silence and thinking for long stretches of time while puzzling it out was imitated by his many followers. The 'Investigations' did not like the 'Tractatus ' before it present the system that would tell the whole truth , answer it all , as it were. It instead put the focus on philosophizing as an activity. And it is a remarkable, enigmatic, aphoristic text rich in suggestions and quandaries. It truly is a book that presents perplexing questions and makes it seem as if ' thinking' is a most serious and difficult business.<br /><br />From the work come key concepts which have been added to ' vocabulary ' of philosophical. Wittgenstein 'Seek the use not the meaning' puts him of course in the company of the pragmatists. The concept of ' family resemblance' in defining a concept in which one does not see a single clear definition, but rather sees 'variations'  whose ' meanings overlap' as in a Venn diagram is another powerful tool of analysis. ' Letting the fly out of the fly bottle' another metaphor for philosophizing too suggested the turn to ordinary language and everyday common experience as central for philosophizing. And this away from the formal abstract logical thinking of 'The Tractatus'.<br /><br />Another point. The 'Philosophical Investigations' is a hard book to understand. And part of the mystique of Wittgenstein is the sense of his incredible ' genius mind' which most of us even those studying philosophy, cannot grasp.<br /><br />My own sense is that if you ask trivial questions you get trivial answers. And that of course much of the metaphysical and religious discourse philosophical analysis, logical  positivism dismissed as nonsense is precisely what is important. 'The Investigations' opens more in the direction( I believe) of allowing for these kinds of meaning. But I am not sure about this.<br /><br />Another point. I do not pretend to understand not only not fully, not even ' largely' 'The Investigations'. The sense of not understanding though puzzling over it of course said something to me about my own ' lesser powers' in philosophy.<br /><br />Years later I would simply recommend to readers of the work to not take it with the kind of seriousness we did then. Take it as an interesting text, even a poetic text, and parse it and find meanings in it which hopefully will enrich your life and philosophical understanding.<br /><br />Do not pray to it. Wittgenstein was a great mind , but a mind to be studied and understood, a frail and fragmented mind also, and not to be worshipped.t.

Israelis love to read him because he writes with clarity , depth, beauty and irony of love and war, and of the realities they know in their everyday life. A walker in the city, a shopper in its markets, a teacher for many years there was something down- to- earth and reassuring about Amichai. In his poetry he uses the religious tradition he knows , making often a kind of ironic secular poetry that plays upon the great literature of the past. His great strengths are many including a deep connection with people he is close to, his parents, his comrades-in- arms, his family, his loves. Amichai is a poet who gives the reader the sense of sharing one's common humanity with. He can take experiences which might seem ordinary and commonplace, and transform them into memorable lines.<br /><br />What a wonderful poet he is.<br /><br />Reading this collection will give insight and pleasure.	2005-02-24

It writes of Jewish women of great distinction in short yet clear autobiographical sketches. It however diminishes its own value but including a too large number of present- day celebrities and lightweight figures. It too displays a certain political bias and there are a number of very left- wing politicians here whose contribution to Jewish life is extremely questionable. I also would have like to have seen many more of the great Jewish women intellectual figures, and heroines like Avital Sharansky , Ida Nudel and others who risked their lives for the Jewish people. A very large share of the entries are of people who have no real positive connection with Jewish communal life, and who just happen to be born Jewish something a few of them are not so happy about.<br /><br />There is much good stuff here.But a work of this kind could have been done with far greater emphasis on real Jewish values.	2005-02-24

Skinner tells the story of Machiavelli's life, and places the major works at the heart of the story. Machiavelli, the high- ranking diplomat, and representative of his native Florence does not write the great political works out of the air abstractly. It is through his diplomatic experience, through his witnessing the city- state wars in the Italy of his time that he comes to the startling political conclusions that he does. Skinner shows how only when Machiavelli had to retire against his will from the active life did he turn to write his masterpiece ' The Prince'. 'The Prince ' teaches the Machiavellan lessons about how the ruler must be swift in decision, ruthless in action , inspiring fear and respect in his subjects. It teaches those lessons of the meaning of ' virtu' of how it is ' the brave to whom Fortune is given'. And how the ruler must shun mercenaries, and foreign dependancies built a defense force of his own if he is to rule securely. Skinner describes Machiavelli's other important writings that too are devoted to questions of ruling. Even Machiavelli's last work ' On the Florentine Republic' considers the mistakes made by rulers which cost the city its independence- and what the true way toward ruling should be. Skinner does not sentimentalize Machiavelli and he shows how private immorality is sanctioned by him if it may lead to what for him is of supreme importance, the public good.<br /><br />This is an extremely good introduction to one of the world's most important political thinkers.	2005-02-24

I know books of columns don't sell, and most people believe that they are yesterday's newspaper, but I love jumping through such collections. If the writer is good as Hanson is there are always observations that enrich understanding. Hanson is a great American patriot someone who believes in America's political, military and moral leadership of mankind. His criticisms of the Europeans in this book come out of the sense that they are not for the most part being loyal allies in the common democratic cause. These columns were published before the first democratic election in Iraq and before we see how the United States is going to deal with state supporters of terror Syria and Iran. Hanson seems to think that Syria is the next likely target of US sponsored regime change. He also unlike many other American conservatives does understand the damage being done to the United States by its support of a corrupt and anti- American Saudi Arabia. Hanson has a tremendous knowledge of military affairs and his historical understanding enrich these columns.<br /><br />If one wants a clearer picture of the world situation, and one which supports an active role for the United States in the world, then this is the collection.	2005-02-23

A lifelong diplomat and ambassador to Britain Raviv served his country well and his accounting is one of a faithful hardworking civil service who believes very much in the miraculous accomplishments of Israel through its first fifty years. Ironically, the book ends with a clear optimistic sense that with the fall of the Soviet Union, the world as a whole is moving towards better times. But today seven years after the book was published Israel is threatened more than ever by a new fundamentalist Islam, and an anti- Semitism of the extreme left and right which has made anti- Zionism the new form of Anti- Semitism.<br /><br />Nonetheless it is not as a prophet that Raviv writes, but as a witness and participant in a remarkable historical process, the rebirth of an ancient people in its historical homeland.	2005-02-23

Vico was part of a society and world in the Naples of his time in which legal thought was highly debated and developed. Vico put his vast learning to use to develop an understanding of human social and historical development as a whole. He was according to Burke the first to really outline and understand the 'savage mind' His great interest and admiration for Homer was central in his understanding that the styles and forms of poetry had too their connection with the stages of history. The three stage historical development of societies was for Vico universal, and the conception of this cycle's repetition influenced among other the literary vision of James Joyce. Burke makes it clear that Vico is appropriated by different political streams, liberal and conservative and seen as one of their own - and that this is part of the richness of his thought.<br /><br />Somehow I would have loved a chapter relating Vico to other systematic readers of the history of human development.<br /><br />Vico is one of those thinkers who  posterity had to truly discover and his masterpiece ' The New Science' was more neglected in his lifetime than understood. But he remains today a vital source of ideas in understanding human society and its development.	2005-02-23

He spent nine years in a Soviet prison defying a System that most people then thought unbreakable. He is one of the many individual heroes involved in toppling the Soviet tyranny.<br /><br />He has since then lived in Israel where he worked as a politician for the improvement of the situation of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.<br /><br />In this work he and his co- author Ron Dermer make the connection between individual political freedom and peace in the world. His idea is that those countries who respect individual rights, care for the freedom of their citizens are much less likely to be aggressive military powers interested in dominating others. Those that dominate within are those that dominate without. The totalitarian Soviet Union conquered a great part of the surface of the world suppressing others. The fundamentalist radical Islamic leaders  not only repress their own people but would through jihad dominate other peoples and countries.<br /><br />Sharansky suggest that all individuals and all peoples desire freedom , and that the ideal situation will come about when there is a world of democracies in which the human rights of all are respected.<br /><br />It seems to me difficult to quarrel with these fundamental insights, and this fundamental ideal vision for mankind.<br /><br />The problem I think is when one addresses the messy situation of mankind today. And when one tries to understand how and when Democracy can be brought to others.<br /><br />In a famous passage in ' The Brothers Karamozov ' the people are shown to reject love and freedom in favor of something far more basic to some of them ' bread and security'.<br /><br />The totalitarian mind , the closed- in- world of one's own narrow right way is not simply imposed from without, but is what many people throughout the world want. Freedom is not necessarily comforting, but also means risk and confrontation in the world of ideas.<br /><br />It may well be then that a good share of Mankind is simply not ready for, nor really desirous ( at this stage) of freedom. This it seems to me is especially, if unfortunately true, in large parts of the Islamic world today.

In speaking before an audience of college students and providing them his own example as writer he stresses again and again the difference between the writer like himself who turns to life, experience , the world, and a writer like Robert Louis Stevenson who learns from books, and writes his own books on the basis of books primarily.

Macpherson's conclusion is as follows: \\" We have seen that Burke was both a defender of a traditional heirarchical social and political order and a believer in the necessity of a pure capitalist economic order.\\" The defense of the traditional order is felt of course in his famous attack on the French Revolution . In his long and distinguished parliamentary career Burke was a defender of ' property' but fought for its proper management and use for the greater benefit of all of society. His literary ambitions were central to his life, and his great contribution to aesthetics his essay on the Sublime is still read as part of the literature on the subject today. Macpherson concludes his study with a consideration of Burke's relevance to political philosophy today. His concluding summary is as follows:<br /><br />\\" Twentieth century democrats, both libral and conservative, share with Burke , the non- democrat, the perception that what is at stake is the legitimitation of a social order, and that this is ultimately a question of moral values. They also share some of Burke's most general moral values. But if they heed Burke's warning about the vital necessity of adjusting principles to concrete circumstances , they must think twice about recruiting him. By his insistence on the importnce of circumstances Burke ruled himself out of court for the late twentieth century.\\"  pp.74	2005-02-22

In this work he exposes the paradoxical ,absurd , insane and evil alliance between the Radical Left and Radical Islam. He traces the history of the development of the Left, and shows how bankrupted by the fall of the Soviet Union they nonetheless cling to their anti- Americanism. He shows how they found a new and unlikely ally in the radical Islam whose sexist and racist policies would seem to be most antithetical to fundamental leftist teachings. The moral and political support given by the Radical Left to those presently conducting a Terror War against the democracies of the West qualifies as far less than legitimate opposition. It is more in the area of ' aid and comfort to the Enemy'.<br /><br />Horowitz has done outstanding work here in focusing attention upon a social phenomenom that unfortunately is not confined to major loonies but now has a major voice in campuses and especially Middle East studies departments throughout the United States.<br /><br />His work is a call for sanity and for survival in acting against this unholy alliance.<br /><br />This book should have a prominent place in all classrooms in which the present political life of the United States is being studied.	2005-02-22

Thurman in telling the story of Dinesen's life, also presents a miniature guide to her work. She does an excellent job of portraying the character of Dinesen, the complex aristocratic independent mind, the romantic nature, the connection with a fairytale world of storytelling, the great courage and determination in making herself into a story when all appeared lost in her life. Thurman tells of Dinesen's childhood , her special connection with her father , the division between two families one wealthy mercantile, and the other more wild and adventurous. Thurman tells the story of Dinesen's long African adventure, the story of her marriage and its sad ending in divorce, and too the story of Dinesen's great love , Denys Finch- Hatton. The story of that love that plays a central part in what is arguably Dinesen's most memorable book , \\" Out of Africa\\" is a story of the man as hunter, adventurer, coming home to be feasted and entertained by his lover- storyteller Dinesen. This story which too ends with Finch- Hatton's death in a plane crash is at the heart of the first part of Dinesen's life. The second part after the African adventure is when she returns home and begins to make that writing life which would make her world- famous. The second -half of the story sees Dinesen more and more playing the part she has created for herself , as storyteller and personnage. It too however has its great human interest, especially in her relation to her mother ,her brother and her extended family. There is of course a vast world of detail I cannot begin to mention in this review. But Thurman tells the story with taste and a beauty as befits a true reader and lover of the work of Dinesen.<br /><br />I believe it really does justice to the spirit of Isak Dinesen's life and work.	2005-02-21

Burrow tells Gibbon's story and outlines the major themes of 'The Decline and Fall' with concision and clarity .He sets Gibbon in the context of his time and shows how his Augustan eighteen century values effect his judgment of the second- century Roman height of development, and the decline from it. Gibbon sees the decline and fall as a movement away from Roman independence, hardiness, military self- sufficiency and virtue to social indolence brought by prolonged prosperity and luxury. The measured and balanced tolerant religions of paganism are weakened and defeated by the enthusiastic superstition of Christianity. The civilized West is overrun by those of the barbaric East. Burrow does a wonderful job presenting Gibbon's biography, the background and preparation leading up to the writing of his great masterpiece. He shows too how Gibbon's great style however it aligns itself in support of Roman social virtue contains a subtlety and elaborative greatness that enables it to capture the positive qualities of Rome's barbarian opponents. Burrow shows how Gibbon's masterful style of antithesis and balance, work to give his account a kind of aesthetic and moral subtlety and ambiguity.<br /><br />This is a very good introduction to one of the greatest of all classics of historical writing.	2005-02-21

He has also written many arresting , beautiful and striking lines, lines which stay in the memory because they have been heard in the songs over and over again as songs are heard over and over again.<br /><br /> \\" How does feel to be out on your own, a complete unknown, just like a rolling stone?\\"<br /><br /> Or \\" I ain't sayin you treated me unkind , you could have done better, but I don't mind, You just sort of wasted my precious time, Don't think twice, it's alright' ,<br /><br />Or  \\" If you go to the north country town where the wind gets heavy on the border - line, remember me to the one who lives there , she once was a true love of mine/ True love of mine.<br /><br />Or. \\" John Wesley Hardin was a friend of the poor/ He traveled with a gun in every hand/<br /><br />  There is a lot of awkwardness and cornyness in Dylan's lyrics. But there is also a lot of great stuff which was made especially good by the music.<br /><br />  For me the lyrics don't stand by themselves alone as powerful enough to be great poetry - but with the melodies the songs they have a  real power to move.<br /><br />  I recommend reading the lyrics and knowing them not so much in themselves but as a way of hearing the music with greater joy.	2005-02-21

The serene perfection of the style, the spareness of detail, the attendance of gods all signal that we have escaped from the gravity of practical questions and have gotten up into a purer element, one that offers less resistance to the ideal. The point of view in ' Out ofAfrica' is that \\"overveiw\\" which KarenBlixen called \\" the one thing of vital importance to achieve in life.\\" What we see is a landscape from the air: time and action have been tremendously compressed and telescopes.So whwn she writes, \\" We grew coffe on my farm. The land itself was alittle too high for coffee and it was hard work to keep it wgoing, we were never rich on the farm, \\" we are , in effect, taking in eighteen years of drought, mismanagement, and struggle, the endless petty quarrels with the shareholders and intrigues with bankers, the terrible fluctations of international coffee prices, and the vagaries of weather .And to describe how she was driven to write by these misfortunes she begins simply: \\"When times were dull on the farm.. This phase is like a seed. It contains a complete lifetime of boredom and loneliness, and the brief visits and precipitous departures of her lover\\".<br /><br />I believe what Thursman is saying is that Isak Dinesen in 'Out of Africa' did not write about her life literally, but instead shaped into a story a fairy tale a work of magic. She transformed her life into a higher realm that of romantic legend. And this explains at least in part its great appeal, for what the reader is really getting is a kind of miraculous picture of a world they can long to be a part of .<br /><br />Magic, mystery and romance in great art make this a unique classic , the story of a great storyteller.	2005-02-21

His turning to ancient literature, his scholarship, textual analysis and literary works were a stepping stone to the Renaissance. His own literary projects vast and ambitious were perhaps less important than the interest he created in both the revival of ancient learning, and the turning to Nature as source for literary inspiration. His vast literary projects in which he intended to contend and in some way outdo his great masters, Cicero , Vergil and on the Christian side Augustine fell by and large flat. What remains of his that is somewhat read today is the Sonnets . In the biography Mann shows how for Petrarch the writing of them too was as much and even more a project of his literary ambition than of his life- love. Petrarch is a great scholar whose vast worlds of interests, and tremendously energetic mind inspired the generations who came after. This excellent study is a very good introduction to his life and work.	2005-02-21

It does give a general outline of Bach's career and story. It claims that Bach did have an ambition to move up in the musical world, and that this dictated his decisions at a number of key points in his life. It tells the story of his two marriages , and the twenty children( Ten who lived to adulthood) but in a very skimpy way. We do not get from this biography any real sense of Bach's thought or inner life even about his music. We do learn about the period of ' cantata writing' and what he did with the ' piano concerto' and something about the character of polyphony in his music.We do not  get a picture of the whole Bachian dynasty in music and the story of how it produced a number of first- class composers, and one overwhelming genius.<br /><br />I think too the biography does not do enough to define that genius, and tell us of its place in the history of music.	2005-02-19

It is written in an unusual way. And much of the text consists in her citations of what other family members have said. It tells the story of her family in Turin, and goes up through her adult life. It is also unusual in that she does not really give her opinion of anything or anyone directly, or probe deeply into herself in any way. In the brief preface she makes it clear that she is engaged in an act of exact remembering. And she says that she has used all the names , the real names of the people in the story.<br /><br />The two major characters are her parents, the father who is Jewish by origin by not by religious practice, is a scientist and engineer. He is a lover of mountaineering, and a man who seems to have no idea of how to make or deal with money. He is violently opinionated, and his outbursts are one central strand in the memoir. The mother is a different soul entirely, a happy person by nature whose best friend is Ginzburg's older sister, but who brings a tone of understanding to all her five children. The story is of the five siblings also, and their eventual careers and marriages. And it is also of the extended family. And in the latter part of the book there is a lot about anti- Fascist activity of family and friends. The work has a kind of authenticity that comes not only from the ' sayings' but from its matter- of- fact descriptive and objective tone. The problem with this, and I feel with Ginzburg's voice in the work is that it is not personally deep enough, and not somehow loving enough. But again there is a texture of great richness, a feeling that what is being described is a whole world. And then too there are so many incidents and events, so many happenings that the reader has a sense of seeing life ' as it really happens'.<br /><br />This work gives a great deal. There is a certain sense however, and perhaps I am wrong here, of it somehow not getting to the deepest depth , of its holding aloof from where the heart is. One great example is the way Ginzburg talks of her first husband. She speaks of him as if he were just another character in the whole story.<br /><br />Nonetheless the reader of this review should know that my review does not begin to touch upon the many characters, events and true complexity of the work.<br /><br />This is a worthwhile and meaningful book. I highly recommend it.olding aloof from where the heart is. One great example is the way Ginzburg talks of her first husband.

Therefore I prefer to not comment on the bulk of Bradley's book, and instead focus on one particular accusation made against Lawrence Summers. This accusation is that Summers reacted ' hysterically' in warning against Anti- Semitism at Harvard and at other U.S. campuses. The fact of the matter is that Summers acted courageously, bucked the tide of opinion not only at his own university but in Middle Eastern Studies Departments throughout the United States. He did this at the risk of being accused of defending the Jews when he himself is Jewish. The fact that he did this when so many other Jewish teachers at Harvard and elsewhere were cowed by the issue and afraid to speak up, underlines his courage.  He did this at the risk of receiving harsh criticism which he did in fact receive from the extreme anti-Israel left who have become in Professor Alan Dershowitz's formulation the ones who have made 'Anti- Zionism the new form of anti- Semitism'. How the radical left became aligned with the extreme Islamic fundamentalist right, and the neo- Nazi right is a long story that can be read about in Phyllis Chesler, Gabriel Schoenfeld's and Ron Rosenbaum's recent works on the ' New Anti- Semitism'. What Summers called for in regard to Israel was fairness, open debate in regard to the Middle East Question. What he really wanted was the end to one- sided stigmatization. He wanted Harvard to have that same kind of open debate, freedom of speech and inquiry that characterizes true democracy. And by the way characterizes Israeli society and not those of any of its Middle Eastern rivals.<br />Summers in regard to the Middle Eastern issue was outspoken and courageous . On this issue this book is unfair to him, and if it is indicative this work is probably not of very great value.	2005-02-18

But I have a number of quarrels with the selection of the book, and with its title. The phrase 'changed the world' seems to me a bit large when describing the lives of popular entertainers ( Barbra Steisand) fashion designers (Trigano) and minor literary figures (Gertrude Stein). It also seems to me unwise and misleading to select people for such lists whose contribution is to enterprises which are in some way antithetical to Judaism. I find on the list (Miriam of Nazareth) and while it is true that this central figure in Christianity is Jewish , her whole meaning as a person has to do with what is not Jewish. This point seems to me an especially point one at a time when there is a not small group of people in the world who have abandoned the Jewish religion , adopted Christianity, and still ( misleadingly) represent themselves as Jewish.<br /><br />This work does have a useful list upon which are included many figures who might have made it the list of fifty.	2005-02-17

According to Lubbock,\\" The labour was atorment, a care, and a delight, as his letters and the Prefaces themselves amply show. The thinking and the writing were hard and full and critical to the point of exasperation; the purpose was high, the reference wide, and the terms of discourse had to be conceived and defined as successive need for them arose. He had to elucidate and appropriate for the critical intellect the substance and principle of his career as an artist, and he had to do this, such was the idiosyncracy of his mind-specifically, example following lucid example with the consistency of mathematicl equation, so that in the Poetics, if his premises were accepted his conclusions must be taken as inevitable.\\" p. vii<br /><br />Blackmur  says that criticism has never been more ambitious, or more useful. He cites James' definition of his task in his preface to 'Roderick Hudson'. \\"These notes represent over a considerable course the continuity of an artist's endeavor, the growth of the whole operative consciousness, and best of all, perhaps their own tendency to multiply , with the implication, thereby of a memory enriched'.<br /><br />Among the prefaces included are those to 'Roderick Hudson' ' What Maisie Knew' 'The Princess Cassamissima' 'The Spoils of Poynton' 'The Altar to the Dead' 'The Tragic Muse'' The Lesson of the Master' ' The Aspern Papers' 'The Awkward Age''The Portrait of a Lady' ' The American'<br /><br />James famous advice to the writer about ' trying to be one upon whom nothing is lost' certainly seems to apply to himself in his effort to understand and deepen the meaning of his own work both for himself and for his readers.	2005-02-17

My wife's father was put on a train at the age of twelve from Vienna and never saw his parents again. They were murdered in Auschwitz. I know people who were the sole survivors of extended families of tens of people. I live in Israel where a very large share of the population has family members who were murdered in the Holocaust. When I was a child in Troy, New York one of my best friends was Sammy Rozines who has since died. He came over from a concentration camp which he his mother, his brother but not his father had survived. There were other Jewish refugees in our small American town , who came to the US and made new lives. They are real people. The Genendelmans, and the Singers, and the Bergers. I remember them all. Thus when I first heard about the phenomenom of Holocaust denial some years ago I could not believe it. Here were all these people in the world who had had relatives murdered, and someone who did not know them, who was not close to being anywhere near what happened , was denying this. Well soon it became clear what it was. Jew - hatred again. The same phenomenom that caused the Holocaust was behind these , I will not say sick, but I will say , evil people who hate even the dead, and who would do them injustice.<br /><br />Deborah Lipstadt who I have heard speak, is a person of tremendous courage and integrity. Her courageous fight against Holocaust denial is a proof of what one dedicated person can do for good. In this book she tells the story of this evil phenomenom and addresses the dangers it represents.<br /><br />Her book is important but there is something even more important. The information available about the Holocaust is available to every person. There have been thousands of books, films, eye-witness accounts of survivors. The proof of the reality of the Holocaust is so tremendously overwhelming that anyone who denies its reality is clearly doing so out of some kind of evil anti- Semitic purpose. I believe the great share of humanity consists in decent and fair human beings who understand not only that the Holocaust occurred, but that it is humanity's task to make sure that no similar evil ever occurs again to any other people.purpose.

The Paris Review chose first- rate writers, and asked them intelligent questions about their own writing practice. As I understand it did not rely on the conversations alone, but enabled the writer to look at the transcript of the initial talk and rewrite. Thus what the reader was given was a really polished literary document. And the interviews supplied many fascinating details. One from this collection I particularly remember was with Hemingway who spoke about his famous sharpening of his pencils, and his rewriting thirty- nine times the ending of I believe ' A farewell to Arms' and his belief that what every writer needed is 'a good sh.. detector'.<br /><br />A truly excellent series for all those who care about writing as ' craft' and as 'art'.	2005-02-17

He tells the story of S.K.'s great renunciation of his Regina( The famous follow- up is his years later remark, \\" Had I had faith I would have married Regina\\") and speculates briefly on the motives. But there is tremendously more to be said about this including a question about Kierkegaard's real meaning for what he called ' his thorn in the flesh'. One logical but I agree not very pleasant speculation might have to do with S.K.'s sense of his own physical inadequacy given the terrible insults and sufferings he had been subject to because of his dwarfish physiognimy.<br /><br />Gardiner outlines Kierkegaard's quarrel with the Church and his effort to define an authentic Christianity based on true inwardness. He also mentions the odd and ironic eulogy by Kierkegaard's older brother at his funeral where he on the one hand praises his brother's writing and on the other condemns him for the very crusade against false Christianity that S.K. dedicated himself to.<br /><br />The description by Gardiner of Kierkegaard's first major work 'Either-Or' is excellent and he gives a deeper sense of the meaning of the ' aesthetic' and ' ethical ' for Kierkegaard. He too gives a good background to the revolt against Hegelianism, and shows how S.K. was not alone in this in his own time.<br /><br />The great literary originality, the play between philosophy and literature, the invention of , and focusing on new religious categories are all parts of S.K.'s legacy to the world.<br /><br />This book gives much, but only skims the surface of a thinker who with every reading is deeper and more complex and more ambiguous.<br /><br />He is nonetheless for many in the world still , the example not only of the individual as authentic Christian, but the individual as authentic individual. .	2005-02-16

Ted Fishman is a veteran journalist with a first- rate economics background , and he marshalls a tremendous amount of evidence to show how Chinese is working toward replacing the U.S. as the world's number one economic superpower. The vast Chinese labor pool can undercut in labor price Mexico and Malaysia and workers being paid twenty- five cents an hour can produce products at one- third the price they would be produced anywhere else. The vast influx of foreign capitol to China is helping this booming nine percent a year growth rate sustain itself. The Chinese do not rest on their laurels but continue entering new economic areas. They have a tremendous hunger for learning  whatever they need in order to produce the products that will provide them with dominance of world markets. Fishman provides a wealth of statistics and charts to show just how powerful and pervasive the new Chinese economy is.<br /><br />He also, for instance in his description of the revived Shanghai gives a splendid portrait of the society as a whole. For the person like myself who knows little about Chinese society and culture the work provides a basic education in everyday Chinese reality.<br /><br />But with all the great value of the book, with all its appreciation of Chinese energy and industry I would still nonetheless caution about one of its central thesis. There are many negatives regarding the Chinese push for such rapid economic growth. One is the enormous pollution problems being caused in the society. Secondly , is the vast energy appetite that China has developed, and which promises to be a constant force pushing world energy prices upward in the future. Thirdly, is the prognosis of many economists regarding the mistaken extrapolation of the present growth trend into the indefinite future. China most believe is going to slow down. And when it starts to grey , it is according to many experts going to face a problem even greater than that of the US. and Europe in regarding to providing decent lives for its elderly generation. There are many other problems, including the one caused by 'child sex selection' leading to a population imbalance in favor of males which effects younger cohorts of the population.<br /><br />Nonetheless Fishman's warning it seems to me is in place especially vis- a- vis the United States. And it seems to me that the deficit problem of the United States does cast a shadow over the American  future.<br /><br />And this leads me to a dimension of the Chinese- US relationship that Fishman does not really cover, a dimension which needs a whole other book, or perhaps many other books, - and that is the military - political dimension. China is not playing the nation- state game according to US rules. Take one notable instance with Iran arguably the most dangerous terror state in the world. China has become Iran's biggest trading partner. It is also its defender in international forums. It has bucked the US effort to prevent Iran from attaining nuclear weapons. China too has weapons programs of its own which constitute a growing danger to the U.S. And this without speaking of Taiwan, or other areas in which Chinese and American interests diverge.<br /><br />There are those such as Niall Ferguson who have been urging the US to convert its present hegemony into a more permanent status as benign imperial power. But as I understand it the danger that is emerging with the new Chinese economic superpower is that it will too come to dominate the world- system politically. And here one essential value distinction must bring us back to a fundamental truth about the new miraculous China. The United States is not simply a free- market capitalistic society it is a true democracy and the flagship of freedom in the world. China is still bound to its Marxist ideology. Andits political reality does not give the human spirit for liberty much joy. Should China come in place of the United States as dominant power the whole world's struggle for greater freedom, liberty and democracy will suffer greatly.<br /><br />So again Fishman's work is excellent on the economic side but it needs to be complemented by more in - depth political studies which will indicate to us where China is going , and what must be done if possible by the free world, to shape its direction and if necessary, restrain it.y does not give the human spirit for liberty much joy.

It focuses on what may be the single greatest danger facing the world today, the acquisition of nuclear weapons by the radical Islamic fundamental state of Iran. Venter is an experienced military correspondent with rich ties both in the Middle East, and in the intelligence services of a number of nations. The picture he paints is of an Iranian regime which has for twenty years deliberately deceived the world , concealing its nuclear program. It has made contacts all over the world , from South Africa to China and including India, and Russia in order to achieve the necessary equipment and technology to build its nuclear weapon. In the persuasive foreword to the volume Defense Expert Steven Tanner gives a very clear exposition of the exact meaning of the Iranian nuclear danger. Iran has threatened more than once to destroy what it calls ' the Zionist entity' and this despite Israel's capacity to retaliate against Iranian cities in a massive way. Iranian nuclear weapons could give it dominance over the Persian Gulf. It would facilitate the creation of an a Shiite superstate with Iraqi Shiites. Even more dangerously Iran is one of the major exporters of terror in the world, and often uses surrogates to do so. Its acquisition of nuclear weapons would mean that the same kind of contracting of terror assignments done in the past might be done with far more horrible results.<br /><br />This book is especially good in detailing the efforts being made all the time by Iran to acquire nuclear weapons. The feeling is that IAEA chairman Mohammed el - Baradei as late as September 2004 was questioning whether Iran had any real nuclear weapons intention would be well advised to read this volume.<br /><br />Venter is cautious on estimating how far Iran has come. And it seems to me he might have quoted those security experts , a few of whom maintain Iran already has a nuclear capacity.<br /><br />Venter is however very good in showing how Russia in building Bushehr and in contracting for more reactors is intensifying the Iranian danger. He does talk a bit about the Chinese Iranian connection but it seems to me that there is a lot more to be said about it than there is in this volume. China has become Iran's largest trading partner and its most staunch defender in International forums.<br /><br />There is another key point. Iran as the major terror state in the world is a key to whether the West will be able to block the radical Islamic Jihad of al-Quaeda, and other terror elements ( Including Iranian backed Hizbollah). In a sense the security and safety of the whole world depend on preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons ( and beyond this in securing regime change in Iran)<br /><br />Venter's book focuses attention on the major security issue of our time. The background information he supplies on Iranian history, the war with Iraq in the 1980's, the character of the Iranian regime is all useful.

The text is excellent .Woolf is a writer I know little about but this work tells her story in a painfully clear way. The early death of her mother, the tyrannical and overwhelmingly difficult if intellectually inspiring  father whose death enabled her to be free enough to write are essential elements. What Clive Bell called the greatest luck of her life, her marriage to the devoted Leonard Woolf. Lehmann describes with compassion and understanding Woolf's mental illness, and how this would become most severe towards the end of writing one of her novels. He also gives short summaries of the novels and outlines their special qualities. This is a good introductory volume by a very sympathetic biographer.	2005-02-14

Russell gives a short summary of the life of Cervantes showing his rich and varied experience, and how his life ideal as soldier and his adventures and misfortunes helped prepare him for the writing of 'Don Quixote' He speaks briefly about Cervantes lesser known works, and how they relate to the one great masterpiece. He then provides summaries of Part I, and Part II of Don Quixote explaining how the characters of Quixote and Sancho are transformed in the work. He is especially interested in showing how Cervantes artfulness in language and in presentation of different authorial and interpretative voices lend an ambiguity and complexity to the work. The fundamental theme of parodying romances of chivalry, through the adventures of a madman knight and his peasant squire is stressed. Russell also in later chapters of the book discusses various ways Quixote has been interpreted and misinterpreted especially  by those Romantics interested in making Quixote a kind of hero in pursuit of the ideal and fantastic. This work is a very clearly written study which greatly enhanced my own personal understanding of 'Don Quixote'. For instance I had myself always idealized Sancho and never understood that he is presented not only as realistic amusing proverb-sayer the foil to Quixote's dreaming absurdity, but that he is also a liar, a glutton, and greedy for money. Russell shows how Sancho is transformed in the course of the novel, and he too shows the way Quixote himself in the Second Part seems to decline in enthusiasm for adventures. Another basic element I did not understand is how much of the comic effect of the novel comes from a questionable practice ethically i.e. laughing at a madman. And this when I did always have an unease about the laughing at the physical hits and knocks, the cruelties. But then I suppose I did understand this to be a kind of clowning and game- like hitting as Quixote always emerges ready for the next adventure.<br /><br />Russell has a concluding discussion on the subject of 'Don Quixote' as the first modern novel. In its dealing with the everyday reality it in some way seems to be. But its aim of course is not the solid nineteenth century representation of reality, but rather that parodying of the fantastic which in itself moves toward the fantastic and ambiguous.<br /><br />This is a rich and thought -provoking introduction to one the great works of World Literature.merges ready for the next adventure.  <br />Russell has a concluding discussion on the subject of 'Don Quixote' as the first modern novel.

In this small introductory work Peter Burke describes some of the contradictions within Montaigne and his various worlds, and moves us to wonder still more about his ultimate meaning and message. On the one hand a devout Catholic and the other the father of modern skepticism, on the one hand a patrician homebody locked into his fortress studio, and in another an adventurer traveling and learning in his books to distant lands , on the one hand very much a man of his own generation of the 1530's and in another a man whose heart is with the ancients Plutarch,and Seneca that are his favorite reading. Burke makes it clear that the very method of Montaigne's writing in which he inserts the words of others in his own text raise endless questions of determining the real intended meaning of Montaigne. There is something of the spirit of play in his endless wandering on the page, the same play which he himself paradoxically defined when he said ' there is nothing more serious than the games of children'. Burke gives us background to the puzzle of Montaigne without conclusively trying to solve it- or even perhaps suggest that solution is possible. One oft- repeated cliche about Montaigne is that he is the first modern man in making himself and his self- definition the major subject of that work. But Burke shows that that self too is elusive and its definition a game, skeptical or not whose meaning readers have enjoyed puzzling out for four hundred plus years and will continue to enjoy reading in the future.	2005-02-13

He says that the Ramchal was a thinker who connected everything with everything else.<br /><br />He also tells his life story, and its tragic ending of a plague in Acre in the Holy Land at the age of thirty- nine. This after he has gone from his native Italy where as a young man he wrote his great works, and then to Amsterdam and to the Holy Land.<br /><br />This work is less known than his Musar Sefer 'Mesilat Yesharim' which is a fundamental treatise in most Yeshivot in learning Jewish ethics.<br /><br />But this work has a very clear and orderly presentation of principles. The Hebrew text is on one side, and Kaplan's English translation on another. And it makes for an attractive volume.<br /><br />An example of the Ramchal's teaching follows.<br /><br />\\" Our sages also ordained blessings before the observation of various commandments, in order to make them all the more significant. We thus thank God for choosing us and giving us such great means of self- rectification. Through these blessings, the observance is elevated still more.<br /><br />As a result of the blessing , God also helpsthe individual fulfill the particular commandment completely. For this is the way things operate: Theamount of help that one receives from God depends on the degree to which he motivates himself toward God, whether, itis to a greater or lesser degree. Thisis true with respect to every possible act, whatever it may be.<br /><br />When one trusts in God, happy is he!	2005-02-13

It is a work printed in many daily siddurim and still considered a clear statement of the fundamental Jewish way of seeing the world.<br /><br />In this volue Avrohom Chaim Feuer makes a detailed and instructive commentary on the text. In the text itself the Ramban preaches the importance of not being angry, of speaking with gentleness of gentleness leading to humility, and this humility being the foremost trait by which the Jew should walk through the world, and relate to God.<br /><br />This is a work that not only should be read, but should be studied over and over , for it teaches us ethical principles of enduring value for our lives.	2005-02-12

I do not feel myself qualified to comment on many of the issues he considers especially those related to internal American economic and social affairs. The reforms of the medical and social security systems he proposes may be an answer to the crises they are now in, but I cannot really venture an educated opinion on this.<br /><br />I can however commend his strong stand in regard to the strengthening of American defenses in the war against terror. His clear recognition of the dangers presented by Islamic fundamentalist and other fanatic terrorism , his understanding that intelligence is key to the battle, and that it is necessary for America to strengthen itself in this area seems to me 'right on'.<br /><br />I also believe that his desire to strengthen the American educational system, to raise the level of its pupils in math and science is an important priority. The future may or may not belong to the better educated, but it is clear that to be competitive on a world-wide scale America cannot rely as it does to an extent already, on importing the best- brains from outside.<br /><br />Gingrich is a true American patriot whose love for his country means his love for its fundamental values, freedom and justice for all.<br /><br />It is possible to quarrel with countless points in this book, and I am show experts on various areas will be able to do so, but it is impossible to quarrel with the truth that Gingrich is an especially dedicated American who in this work too has found a way of serving his country.	2005-02-11

Tolstoy is of course a great and complicated figure whose two masterpieces ' War and Peace' and 'Anna Karenina ' stand at the summit of world - fiction. Gifford tells the story of the landowner, patriarch Tolstoy whose vision of a better world was somehow rooted in the social thought of the eighteenth century. He tells of how Tolstoy made at the center of his vision of community, the ideal of the family. He reads 'War and Peace' in his brief chapter on the subject as a work in which personal connections and relations are always made in terms of family connections. He underlines the uniqueness of Tolstoy's social vision, and his great loneliness in pursuing it. He does not however really begin to explain the miracle of Tolstoy's powerful presentation of reality, his incomparable capacity to make the physical and social worlds come to life. This book provides much information to add to our understanding of Tolstoy , but not in regard to what is most important in him, the miracle of his creative art.	2005-02-09

His commentary makes an effort to present moral lessons which can be relevant to the reader today.<br /><br />Here for instance are his closing words on Parshat VaYeshev:<br /><br />\\" It is incumbent upon us to learn from the sale of Yosef the devastating effect of jealousy and hatred, even in its subtlest forms and even in the greatest of people, so that we can strive to conduct ourselves in a manner that will cause us to merit seeing the ultimate reunion of Yosef and his brothers , when Mashiach ben Yosef will be sent as a harbinger of Mashiach ben David. \\"<br /><br />And here is his commentary on Parshat Balak:<br /><br />The followers of Balaam inherit Gehinnom.Some explain that their way of life makes this world a Gehinnom. People whoknow only how to criticize and find fault create Gehinnom for everyone-themselves as well as others.Conversely, one who has a good eye to counterbalance the evil eye, creates a Gan-Eden for others and for himself.\\"<br /><br />This is a Torah commentary rich with relevant moral lessons, and is highly recommended.	2005-02-09

It is not 'Sabbath: Days of Eternity' but rather 'Sabbath: Day of Eternity'<br /><br />In this work Aryeh Kaplan seeks to answer basic questions about the substance and meaning of Shabbat. He discusses the connection between Shabbat and belief in God, affirmation of God as Creator of all things. He shows the relation of the Exodus ofEgypt and the coming of the Messiah to Shabbat. He answers the question of why the Shabbat is called by the Gemara a ' taste of the world to come'.<br /><br />And he indicates why the Shabbat is so essential to the Jew's view of the world.<br /><br />Aryeh Kaplan is one of the greatest teachers of Torah modern Judaism has had. And here once again he teaches the major ideas of Judaism in a clear and convincing way.<br /><br />This work is recommended  to both Shabbat - observant and non- Shabbat observant alike.<br /><br />The keeping of Shabbat brings us closer to God, and is a major element of the Jew's service of God in the world.<br /><br />I hope the reader who reads this will think of the Shabbat to come and have a most beautiful and wonderful Shabbat.<br /><br />' Gut Shabbos'' 'Shabbat Shalom' to us all.	2005-02-09

It is written in a clear , understandable and appealing way. It's aim of bringing those who have been distant closer to the Jewish light is admirable. I am a bit troubled by the misleading hype on the cover of the book, and the approach it suggests. This book does not have the ' answers' and life is not a short- answer test , either 'fill- in' or  ' multiple choice'. Still there is much good stuff in this book and it is certainly worth a serious consideration.<br /><br />Here is one of the nice passages of the book from Rabbi David Aaron's conclusion:<br /><br />\\" why did Hashem give the Endless Light in the first place? Surely Hashem knew that the vessels were incapable of receiving the light. Surely Hashem knew they would buy into the snake's pitch and get themselves thrown out of the Garden of Eden. So why put them in the garden in the first place?<br /><br />Yes,Hashem knew Adam and Eve wouldn't make it in the garden. Yes, Hashem knew that the vessels couldn't receive the light.The vessels -although only for a split second - got a taste of the ultimate. And Adam and Eve-if only for a day got a taste of Paradise.<br /><br />We are born with a taste of the ultimate, a memory of Paradise.We will never forget how good it once was. We will forever yearn for how good it could be. We come into this world yearning for the Endless Light of Hashem, wishing we could get back to the Garden ofEden. Living begins with yearning.<br /><br />Had we never tasted the ultimate, we could never yearnfor it. It's precisely this yearning that drivesus on our quest. We are born hungry for the light. We don't know exactly what it is, but we know that it is. We search.\\"<br /><br />I am happy with the idea presented here, that we are searchers for the light rather than with the idea suggested on the cover i.e. the idea that this work is going to provide us with ' the light' and an insurance policy that it is ours forever.<br /><br />One more word. I think when we think of light in relation to the Jewish tradition we should always keep in mind , a somewhat different light, the light which was a central theme in the life of Rabbi Abraham Yitzhak HaKohen Kook, Z\\"ts\\"l and that is 'the light of repentance'.ord.

The complicated symbolism and learning of the Kabbalists is contrasted with the simplicity and directness of Hasidic prayer. The Kabbalists are opening complicated locks with hidden keys, while the Hasidic masters are smashing the lock open with their own broken hearts. The Kabbalists are focusing on some cosmological tikkun of the world as a whole, while the Hasidic masters are focusing on individual devekut individual clinging and attachment to God. The excerpts given here can help the reader realize that service of God which is the holy essential duty of every Jew.	2005-02-09

Therefore I found it difficult to be tremendously excited by this book. But the arguments made in it , concerning the wisdom of basing our economic life primarily on decisions of individuals, and not on government regulation do make sense to me. Also the whole tone of the work which is a gently persuasive one rather than one which harshly and angrily casts into the lower world all opposition, appealed to me.<br /><br />Finally. It is clear that in providing opportunity to its citizens to realize their own potential and pursue their own happiness, the economies of the West, and most especially of the United States have done far better than those of the East including that of the now defunct Soviet Union.<br /><br />It is important to note however that this system today is not simply a laissez - faire one which allows for an endless war of all upon all, but is modified by social welfare measures.	2005-02-09

Thus the most powerful and convincing part of this work is the author's showing the shortcoming of various answers given by others. However instead of remaining discontent with his and our inability to answer this question the author makes a noble if in my opinion mistaken effort to explain this Evil by speaking of its contribution to human creative power and freedom. I agree that suffering often teaches, may help make a person a far better human being. It also may make them worse. I also agree that our service of God in the world means using our own powers and freedom for Good. But I do not see how this explains or even begins to explain the kinds of injustice millions of human beings have suffered in this world. There are throughout Jewish and human history millions of children who were killed before they had a chance to live. There were millions of largely innocent human beings who had to go through the worst possible horrors. What explanation can there be for this? That other evil people have done this ? But there are after all great destructions caused by Nature. And there are too Evils so out of proportion with what would be helpful to people's ' growth' as to make the whole presumption of its beneficiality ridiculous.<br /><br />I prefer the position of Rebbe Lev Yitzhak of Berditchev who put God on trial and yet continued praying to God. I believe that is the honest answer if there is one.<br /><br />As a person who needs God so much and prays to God all the time even as I write this now, I pray I am not making God angry with my words. But we have, I have no explanation for so many evils so much evil done , without justification or reason.<br /><br />God , where were You when so many of your children were....	2005-02-09

He was a person of great integrity who deeply cared for the Jewish people. His understanding of Jerusalem as the spiritual center of the Jewish people was one major element of his thought. His concern with Jewish survival after the Shoah was another central element. As a survivor of Sachsenhausen concentration camp, as one who was trained as a Rabbi, and became an academic philosopher he had a background which moved him to a very deep reading and thinking about Jewish history. All this comes to focus in 'To Mend the World' where he outlines for the Jewish people centered in Jerusalem a way of hope toward the future. He does this through reading of history and midrashim traditional religious texts, and creating a Jewish world of thought of his own.	2005-02-09

He invigorates and revives Hebrew language poetry. He writes with a special kind of intensity of longing for Zion, and longing for love. He identifies with and writes powerfully of Jewish suffering. And he makes the painful cry for its redress. He speaks for the Jewish people in its historical desire to return to the land of Israel. He too speaks intimately, painfully of romantic love and loss. And he touches upon the world of his childhood, his parents with a special intensity and strength. Bialik did not write a huge amount of work, but he wrote many memorable poems and lines. He is the first great Hebrew poet of the modern Zionist enterprise. And his songs and his poems fill the hearts and minds of many true lovers of poetry.	2005-02-08

Most demographers expect that number will increase to between eight and nine billion in the year 2050 and then begin to decline. Already forty- four percent of the world's population lives in countries with negative population growth. Europe which numbers 72 million people today will decline by one hundred million by 2050. The United States thanks to immigration primarily is the only major industrial power that will continue to increase in population, despite its already having a close to zero population growth. China will peak at 1.5 billion people by 2030 and then begin to decline. Japan is already along with Italy, Spain and Germany a county with great negative growth.<br /><br />But what Ben Wattenberg presciently a couple of decades ago labeled ' the birth dearth' is not simply a question of numbers. Those numbers translate into social and economic consequences.A world in which people live longer , and in which there are fewer births is a world in which younger generations will be required to bear a larger and larger burden to pay for the social benefits of the elderly. A world in which there are smaller new generations is one in which there will likely be economic stagnation and even decline , as the number of new customers and consumers declines. A world in which there are increasing numbers of one- child only families is one in which there is less likely to be risk- taking entreprenurial activity.<br /><br />Wattenberg presents and analyzes the numbers while at the same time making a social critique . He sees that our modern world has pushed toward less and less value given to family and home. It has worked to provide more and more incentives for women to be in the workplace and at the university, without balancing this by giving proper economic reward for the raising of children.<br /><br />Wattenberg sees the birth dearth and the greying of mankind as connected with social pathologies which threaten the valuing of life, and the providing of hope in the human future.<br /><br />The facts he gives and the arguments he makes should be studied by all our political leaders, and should be part of the education of every individual who cares about the human future.d the providing of hope in the human future.  <br />The facts he gives and the arguments he makes should be studied by all our political leaders, and should be part of the education of every individual who cares about the human future.	2005-02-08

From 76 million to 275 million citizens , from a largely rural country to an urban highly- industrialized one, from a country in which a high- school education was had by six percent only to one in which high- school education was had by eighty- three percent. Life -expectancy increased during this period twenty-six years for males and twenty- nine for females. The quality of life, in education, in health, increased enormously. The number of working hours and days declined, and the women's participation in the work- force increased enormously. Overall fertility declined through the century with the exception of the baby- boom years. Cohabitation before marriage which was nonexistent in 1900 became the rule in 2000. And in another disturbing trend for many Americans the rate of children born out of wedlock increased greatly to be now over twenty- five percent. Crime of all kinds also increased considerably though there has been leveling off in many areas since the eighties. Prosperity as measured by living space, by opportunities and time for leisure have also gone way up.<br /><br />The overall picture given despite many negative trends is that the twentieth century was one of enormous progress and development for America. This of course was the century when it was a major factor in two world - wars, and in defeating the evils of Nazism and Fascism.<br /><br />As the century ended America was the world's sole superpower and its leader politically, militarily and culturally.<br /><br />This book is a wealth of information about developments over the century and it is highly recommeded.	2005-02-08

They succeed in making the Gemara come alive for many who would otherwise not know it. Their work came at a transition time when many Jews were leaving Traditional learning. Essentially Bialik had a program for educating Jews in the sources, in the Tradition so that they would be fully part of despite there not having learned in the Yeshiva world.<br /><br />This English translation should widen the circle of those who study and learn this work.

In this work he takes a look at a whole list of claims being made against the United States which argue for its decline, and provides persuasive arguments against them. He also tells us much good news about America which as he understands it is continuing to prosper, continuing to provide more freedom for more people than any country in history. This book in its time was a refreshing antidote to the claims that Japan and Germany were about to overtake the US economically. Wattenberg's faith in America has certainly been borne out in the years since the book was published as  it now stands as the sole superpower in the world, the leader politically, militarily , economically and culturally. There are of course caveats and I believe Wattenberg does not really take into deep enough account the dark sides of the American reality.	2005-02-08

In this work he wants to help his readers escape their loneliness and difficulties in life through finding their own ' soul-print' their own spiritual I.D. In self- help book fashion he preaches that the way to one's true self is the way to a meaningful life. Unfortunately Rabbi Gafni does this while ignoring the more traditional Jewish view that the deepest way to find oneself is through giving to others in one's own family and community, to worshipping not oneself but God. Yet Rabbi Gafni reads Midrashim with startling insight , and it seems to me that there is great benefit in reading this book if only in that it shows the readers(who probably have small knowledge of traditional Jewish texts including Midrashim) how deep and powerful the Jewish tradition is.	2005-02-08

When he wrote this work about the ' birth dearth' many pooh-poohed him but now the trends which even then were clearly visible in the Industrial world have extended themselves to the third world. And if the birth- dearth is more apparent in Europe where replacement - level fertility is not in sight among major nations now too Japan, South Korea and even China are at below replacement- levels.<br /><br />Wattenberg understood that the birth- dearth would present great social problems including that of younger and smaller  generations demographically having to work harder to pay the massive government debts to social security programs for the retired. But the birth- dearth promises social and economic problems in additional ways including a problem of declining economic growth over-all. So far as we know economic expansions have historically been connected with expanding populations. We know no precedent for declining populations being accompanied by new economic growth.<br /><br />Wattenberg is also sharply critical of the culture of narcissism of individual focusing on ' me and me alone' which he sees as responsible for the ' birth dearth ' in the West. Here he is not simply social scientist but moralist of the first order.	2005-02-08

His relation to Nature is deep and fresh, and yet too humble and moral, wild and beautiful. His direct experiential mode of meeting Nature in youth, is transformed into something far greater in his meditative and reflective relation to it . Wordsworth somehow brings to his meetings with nature a noble cast of mind. So too in his moral sentiment there is not a preaching narrowness, but a broad vision of something far more deeply interfused . Wordsworth in giving everyday life and perception a sense of the sublime is somehow a religious poet. The sense of something sublime that flows through all things is too a sense of something Divine.<br /><br />Reading Wordsworth is receiving the sense that life too and our experience have a dimension of beauty and nobility which make them supremely worthwhile.<br /><br />Reading Wordsworth one feels that one is lifted up to one's own better nature.<br /><br />And this too when there are in him immortal lines, which like ' the best part of a good man's life is small acts of kindness and of love' are unforgettable.	2005-02-07

This is especially true in regard the story of Rip Van Winkle.But there was nonetheless in the atmosphere of the stories, something of the feeling of old  America, the Dutch- English America so present in the Renssaeleer County I grew up in. Later in life returning to Irving's work I read some of the Alhambra Tales and sketches. All the writing seemed to me to come of ' another world and time' a world and time much more leisurely and slow than the America which was to follow. It is hard to believe but it is little more than  thirty-  years between Washington Irving's gentelmanly meanderings, and the American Renaissance of Melville, Hawthorne, Emerson, Thoreau and Whitman. Irving is the first American writer known to the world, but he does not really presage the great American creative outburst that is to follow him.<br /><br />One more point. There is a story from the Talmud about Honi ha- Maagel who goes to sleep for a generation. And when he wakes up finds a wholly new world. He makes then the famous remarks ' Death is preferable to living without friends'. Perhaps Washington Irving too had a sense of being somewhere back in the past, far out of the time of present everyday America. And thus perhaps he suggests that if you sleep too long when you wake up your world is lost and it as if you are dead . i.e. it is as if you have not woken up at all.<br /><br />Irving in this sense as a writer seems more some one read as a relic than one who gives the kind of inspiring fire his great American successors will provide.	2005-02-07

His most well- known work are his Essays. And his poems share a certain quality with these essays as they are rich in ideas and moral probings. Emerson's most well- known poem is one which every American schoolchild once leared. It is the poem of the beginning of the Revolutionary War. \\" Here is where the embattled farmers stood , and fired the shot heard round the world.' Emerson musings can be deep and also reflect his Transcendental philosopher, \\" If the slayer thinks he's slain\\" .One line of his diaries sticks in my mind as a particularly great line of poetry. This is when he ' walks across Boston Common glad to the brink of fear'.<br /><br />There is a tremendous richness in this work and much to be deciphered and enjoyed by the probing reader.	2005-02-07

Smaller portions, eating more slowly, enjoying one's food fully, eating fresh food, avoiding junk food, walking and exercising , checking one's weight not by looking at the scale but by checking one's belt notches, avoiding binge eating and stuffing oneself endlessly.<br /><br />All this is fine. But the French are generally smaller in size (in height also)than Americans, and they too provide often in restaurants what would be regarded in America as miniscule portions. Thus it is quite unreasonable to expect Americans to adjust their whole way of living and being to that of a people who have a different mentality. The French are in general more small and miserly than the Americans, who tend to be overgenerous in all that they do.<br /><br />So while I think the book makes a lot of sense I do not think it will really change much of anything in time.<br /><br />In general Americans do need a certain kind of 'downsizing'in the way they see themselves, and live in the world. Excess always causes problems. And perhaps this book will help some individuals move in this direction.	2005-02-07

They say far more than my own contribution.<br /><br />I have read in and out of the Pepys' diary more than once. I did this in part because I have read many times that they are the ' best diaries' ever written. Without contending with that I found that they were not for me the most interesting. This probably shows more about my own shortcomings than it does about the work of Pepys.<br /><br />Pepys' work is filled with description of the life of the time. It is rich in perception of the great city of London in Restoration times. It is filled with personal anecdote, gossip including that relating to his prodigious sexual appetite and activity. It is a busy, businesslike work. And it tells more about a world outside than a world in.<br /><br />In the diaries I most love there is the quest of the soul to deeply understand itself and its relation to other people, and God. I find that the flurry of activity in the life of Pepys does not lead to this kind of reflectiveness. And thus for me the 'diary' is not a highly significant work personally.	2005-02-07

It is the triumph of ability and will and courage, and another startling example of how the American dream can be realized. It is also on a parallel track a story of assimilation in America, of denial of one's own identity.This is also often part of the American reality. In Douglas case however this was modified by his return to his Jewish religion and identity after having gone through a serious accident. This story has something of the energy and vibrancy of Douglas' screen personality. It is rich with anecdotes including many celebrity anecdotes as Douglas and his wife were long a part of Hollywood's social world. The question of his morality in relation to women , his many 'conquests' is a real one. But all in all he beside being one of the best American actors in the past half - decade has made a very positive contribution to his society.	2005-02-07

Longellow is the poet of the American public school. 'Evangeline' 'The Courtship of Miles Standish' 'Paul Revere's Ride' ' The Village Blacksmith' ' 'A Psalm of life' and others. His reputation in the nineteenth century was great and overwhelming. Yet his reputation in the realm of poetry today is not with those artists of the canon, Tennyson and Browning in England, and Whitman and Dickinson in the United States. Perhaps it is  because his poems are taken to be not inventive enough linguistically.  Perhaps it is because the very thing many have praised him for his musicality seems today to be less than the irregular music of a Hopkins or Dylan Thomas.<br /><br />In any case in Longfellow one will find sound solid lines, a certain moral stance , a kind of American integrity. For someone like myself reading Longfellow is a nostalgic trip and a new perspective on what I read so long ago. He has much to give even if it is not quite at the highest poetic level.	2005-02-07

I understand that point -of- view. There is so so much in Russell's life and thought that inspires admiration. He is by all accounts a great philosopher. He was a truly masterful writer, and his 'History of Western Philosophy'did the seeming impossible and made reading about the subject interesting and entertaining. Russell was a maverick and went his own way in the world of political thought. He may have been a fool when it came to Communism but he surely was right to see the dangers of a nuclear world, and courageous to fight against them. His zest for life, his ability to appreciate and enjoy so many things in life is certainly an admirable quality. He wrote with vigor and clarity and often great wit and humor. He could recognize the value of others, as for instance in his championing of Wittgenstein. He did seem deeply disturbed by human suffering and care deeply to somehow lessen it. Yet the personal cruelty stands strongly against him, and he would seem to join a long list including Marx and Gandhi of ' cruel humanitarians' . His atheism too disturbs me because he shows so little emotional understanding of the needs of religious believers. Russell was very thin and that thinness seems to me to somehow capture something of his essence, also his prose. He lacks a certain  complexity, a certain kind of depth that comes in going deeper inside the heart and soul. He was a very great thinker, and writer but I do not believe that as a human being he had the highest kind of feeling and understanding for others.  Perhaps one of the greatest 'flat characters'of the twentieth century, a century which also had a few 'rounded ones' of greater human complexity and intensity.	2005-02-06

He is perhaps best known for his political writing, his founding of Dissent magazine his championing of a Socialism which did not degenerate into radical hatred of the West and of America. For  close to forty years he was at the intellectual center of American life. He was also a great Yiddishist one of the main people in presenting the Jewish secular writing of Eastern Europe to the world. And he was a skilled literary critic , a man of broad knowledge and careful judgment whose special understanding was the realm where politics and literature interconnected. As  a writer he  was clear and competent. This autobiography it seems to me has very much the flavor of his general critical writing. It seems to me it lacks a deeper dimension of confessional feeling that the greatest autobiographies have. But it is a very workmanlike, responsible piece of craftsmanship.	2005-02-06

For myself most of Tennyson's longer poems have been more skimmed and tasted by me than really chewed and digested. Tennyson lives as a poet to me primarily through one poem, 'Ulysses'. This poem to my mind perfectly embodies a certain heroic stance toward life. It does this in  immortal lines. The poem tells the story of the great Ulysses returning home after having voyaged and become ' a part of all I have met' . He is now not the youth who set out in the beginning but an elderly veteran. He begins with , 'Though much is taken much abides' And so in mid-life or in late- life having come home he is not content to rest. But is an ' old man explorer' who sets out again to meet and make his destiny. ' Though much is taken much abides, and though we are not that strength, which in old days, moved earth and heaven, that which we are we are, one equal temper of heroic hearts, made weak by time and fate, but strong in will, to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.'<br /><br />This kind of determination not only spoke to the Victorian world, and to Tennyson's own life- situation with its great losses and difficulties, but I believe will speak to mankind for so long as we are human.	2005-02-06

We live in a world after the Holocaust where more than one- third of the Jewish people were murdered. We also live in a world in which the Jewish people are presently under attack from a radical Islamic fundamentalism aimed at destroying the Jewish state of Israel. We live in a world in which thousands of Christian missionaries feel that it is more important to convert the thirteen million Jews than it is to work either on themselves, or on the other four billion people of the planet who are neither Christians or Jews.All this being the case it seems to me that the author had a duty to write a work that would strengthen Jewish identity and peoplehood, and not make it more questionable. Thus it seems to me completely insensitive of the author to put so many founders of Christianity as 'most influential Jews' I think that they belong rather in a book called ' Most Influential Christians'.<br /><br />Secondly, does it really make much sense to put the creators of Superman in a book with Biblical figures?<br /><br />Jewish history ( a third point)is filled with remarkable figures who make some of the American pop figures the author chooses small and insignificant.<br /><br />The author, it seems to me, might better have done a book on the them (  Jews  who have done the most good for their own people.)	2005-02-06

I have read its table of contents, the first five pages, and all the reviews posted on Amazon. From looking at the Table of Contents I have the clear feeling that the author has considered many of the major problems involved in the writing of autobiography. She too it seems to me has opened up for many people a way of making their own lives and experience more meaningful. If she can help as I sense she already has , people who wish to reflect on their past, and make some sense of it, do so, then her work is a blessing.<br /><br />As I understand it many many people would be helped by being able to write the story of their lives. I know several who have done this just for their own families and find it meaningful.<br /><br />I would however disagree with one thing I read in the few pages of the book I did read. I do not believe all life - stories should confine themselves to what they are to a small closed circle. There are lives, perhaps the exception, who touch upon many others, and whose meaning connects with greater publics and worlds. The great autobiographies from Augustine on down have this element of connecting with wider worlds and themes.<br /><br /> In the Hasidic Jewish tradition it is taught that the life of a great teacher, the story of a human being truly devoted to living and teaching the word of God, becomes itself a Holy Book, a Sefer Torah.<br /><br />Perhaps it would be helpful for all of us  to look for those times of blessing in our lives, and write about them.	2005-02-06

While Kaplan was without doubt a major Jewish twentieth century figure the results of his efforts are not particularly encouraging. The Jewish people it seems need God far more than they need Kaplan's 'God idea'. The Jewish people once they follow Kaplan's prescription and  make of their religious life a ' tradition' only, lose a dimension of meaning not easily gained elsewhere.. Is it surprising then that what we have today in the Jewish world is so so much assimilation on the one hand, and a growth in a more narrow kind of Haredi Judaism?<br /><br />Kaplan was a prolific, and in certain ways heroic figure.But his ideas and his whole view - of - the -world did not bring about true Jewish renewal.

A man heading for a fair is full of hope.He has no idea what bargains he will find and what he will accomplish. He flies toward the fair swift as an arrow, at full speed. Don't bother him.He has no time. But on the way back he knows what deals he has made and what he has accomplished. He's no longer in a hurry. He's got plenty of time. No need to rush. He can assess the results of his venture. He can tell everyone about the tripat his leisure-whom he has met and what he has seen and heard at the fair. \\"<br /><br />So the book is Sholom Aleichem returning from the fair and looking at his life in retrospect. It is a shame that he did not have time to complete the whole story. But what he gives us is a a very restrained and humorous account of his childhood world. It is perhaps not what he hoped and believed it to be, his greatest work, and it is certainly not his most popular work  but it does give much insight into his own life, and does contain many good Sholom Aleichem stories.	2005-02-05

Tolstoy was a far greater artist than a theoretician of Art. His resentment of Shakespeare is a misreading, and his favoring one particular kind of Art shows him somehow striving to be ' hedgehog ' when he is truly the fox.

So many of the cultural heroes of the Western world from Voltaire to Wagner were anti- Semitic, or had some anti- Semitic writings. Many such as  Tolstoy Goethe Dickens balanced anti- semitism with very pro- Jewish remarks. True Nietzche stood against Wagner. But on the whole even into this century with Pound, Eliot, Celine, Heidegger  there were ' great creators' who bore in their mind and soul resentment and hatred of the Jews.<br /><br />Even with Shakespeare who according to Harold Bloom's wonderful exaggeration ' invented the human' there is the question of his true intent with Shylock. Does a Jew really have hands and eyes for Shakespeare?<br /><br />I believe that this book should be far more widely read and known than it is. And it should be part of the legacy of all those Jews who have given their lives to Western culture.	2005-02-03

The story of one young Jewish girl's living in hiding, and surviving with her family during the Holocaust has perhaps been read more than any other diary in history. The story is not only of survival in everyday life, but of the growing pains of one young adolescent girl. This girl is however a person of remarkable, insight, intelligence and spirit. That she was among one of the more than million Jewish children whose lives were taken from them before they had a chance to live suggests how incomparably great this loss  was and is. Anne Frank has become a symbol of humanity's contending with evil, and at the same time retaining its humanity. Her faith that in the end ' people are good at heart' in the face of the experience she knew can be an inspiration to all of us who looking at the evils of the world today , need to hope that a better world and a kinder humanity will be our future.<br /><br />It is horrible to know that the monstrous Nazi European anti- Semitism which took the life of Anne Frank has now become a major element in the anti- Western Jihad which a part of the Islamic world is now engaged in.<br /><br />Would that the lesson of Anne Frank's life and loss be that instead of hating each other we all learn to be kinder and more considerate towards our fellow human beings.	2005-02-03

I am certain that had  Bernard Lewis written this work today its emphasis and message would be slightly different. The Islamic today has been infested with a vicious kind of anti- Semitism which it learned in part from Nazi Europe. It has developed a kind of ideological hatred of Jews which there as Lewis indicates have been signs of in Islamic history but which did not generally become the dominant note in most societies. The inferior dhimmi status accorded the Jews allowed them to for long periods of time live in relative peace in many Muslim lands. As Lewis indicates they were never truly given equal status, and Islamic society retains always the dominance of Muslims, but they at least could go about their business fairly well. Now it is all changed. The Islamic world is doing its best to be Judenrein. Its way of speaking about Jews and acting toward them (The hatred demonization hystical suicide- bombing, the sheer murderousness)come from a very dark place in the human soul. Lewis in his recent books has I believe been a bit more critical, emphasized a bit more these negative signs in Islam which unfortunately have become dominant today.	2005-02-03

Gimpel is the eternal innocent, the good person who life and its cruelty continually mock and humiliate without ever managing to destroy his goodness and faith. He is the 'fool' who in his goodness and faith is holier than us all. A Jewish Quixote but one without heroic pretensions one instead filled with kindness and love even when he is being laughed at and made a fool of.<br /><br />'The Spinoza of Market Street' is the story of an impossible love. It is the story of redemption and rebirth of body and soul through human kindness and caring. It is the story of an old philosopher lost in his dreams of Spinoza who is nursed back into life as man by a caring lonely unattractive woman. It is story of hope and of the redemption of the human soul.<br /><br />How beautiful and deep these two great stories, how they give food and hope for body and soul.	2005-02-02

It is that the private enterprise economy of the United States has not given enough of its resources to infrastructure needs. This is apparent in the United States today , and great investments are needed to shore up aging systems.<br /><br /> Galbraith is a very fast- minded, and enjoyable writer with a real sense of humor. He made reading Economics in my college days a bit more pleasurable. It is unfortunate that the economic Abundance of the Affluent Society has not yet reached all Americans much less all of Mankind. But Galbraith did see that the dismal misery of the mass of mankind the hard economic reality which had applied through the ages no longer applied in America. This perception was true in the fifties and is even more true today.	2005-02-02

He more than any other player changed the game and made it America's national pasttime. After being the greatest pitcher of his time for Boston he was traded to the Yankees where he went on to begin making the home run synonymous with his name. In the house that Ruth built' Yankee Stadium along with Lou Gehrig  he lead the Yankees of the 1920's to a string of pennants and  World Series. Both on and off the field the Babe was outsized, and seemed to be unstoppable. He was the greatest player the game ever had and probably ever will have. He was in some sense a babe all his life, childlike and uncontrollable but he was also famous for acts of kindness, including the famous homerun hit on request by a young fan fatally ill. His love of the game and his love of life are now apart of America's legendary heritage.	2005-02-01

It is the most important fictional work envisioning a totalitarian future, and warning against it. At the same time it is not a very convincing or moving fiction. Orwell had a one- dimensional quality in his creation of character, and it is very difficult to identify closely with or feel deeply about his characters in this work.<br /><br />Yet now that '1984' has come and gone without the disaster Orwell predicted it still holds our attention as one possible nightmare human future. As importantly it makes its own forceful statement against the kind of controlled, closed- minded world the Soviets, the Nazis, and now the Islamic Radical Fundamentalists would have us be imprisoned in.	2005-02-01

In another for many I knew growing up in America it was a kind of religion. Malamud understands both these dimensions and in this work he plays on the sense of baseball as a kind of metaphor for all that is important in life. The story of Roy Hobbs partakes of many of the myths of baseball , the small- town boy who makes it big, the underdog who comes from behind, the hero of extraordinary powers who single- handed like the Babe himself takes a team and makes it into a champion and a legend.<br />This is not my all- time favorite baseball book (That distinction belongs to two books largely  unread today, Zane Grey's ' The Shortstop ' and Charles Einstein's ' The Only Game in Town' )but it is a very good book that shows a real understanding of both the game of baseball and the game of life.	2005-02-01

The choice between the aesthetic life represented in the first part and the moral life defended in the second is one such theme. So is the masking of his own identity, the division of himself into a multiplicity of names and identities behind which the true identity is a question. The story of the seduction, however ironically transmitted here is some variety of that fundamental story of Kierkegaard's life his engagement to Regina Olson which he broke because as he later said ' he lacked true faith'. And this perhaps also a cover for the ' thorn in the flesh' that limitation which is central to Kierkegaard' life of abstinence, and perhaps relates to his physical condition , or perhaps to his relation to his father. The aesthetic, the moral phases and what for Kierkegaard is beyond either/or the transcendent phase of the religious is also in this work in the question of who is the ' true Christian'. All of these themes are presented in the multipled- voice ironic humorous suggestive prose of a great imaginative writer and thinker . This is the first masterpiece of many to come, and the opening of the career of the one who would be the ' only Christian in Christendom'.<br /><br />For the religious Jewish reader like myself aside from the difficulty and pleasure in trying to make something of the depth of Kierkegaard's thought there is the message of the lone creative individual more individual than other individuals in realizing himself in a kind of philosophical literature only Kafka and Neitzche and Pascal are perhaps the true equals of.	2005-02-01

It focuses on his way of seeing things, his path in perception in Art and Social Criticism. Landow claims that Ruskin thought by seeing and in this seeing also saw the symbolical and mythological meanings he valued in Art. Landow discusses Ruskin's championing and promoting of the work of J.M. Turner. He often cites that complicated Ruskin prose style which supposedly influenced among others Proust. He outlines Ruskin's social thought, his concern for the poor and presents Ruskin's unique conception of economics. For Ruskin wealth was not measured in money or possessions but ' fullness of life'. And Ruskin believed the great deprivation and social evil was not simply in material poverty but in loss of opportunity for cultural and spiritual enrichment. Ruskin is a visionary of Art and Social Reality, who saw both with the eyes of Tradition and with his own radical ideals of how to better reconstruct the world.  Landow also indicates the very great influence of Ruskin in Victorian thought. As one who does not know Ruskin's work that well I felt this work gave me a clear idea of the main purpose and direction of a major nineteenth - century creative visionary.	2005-02-01

This ability was displayed in the essay ' Shooting an Elephant' where he carries out the imperative of his colonial official task, and at the same time understands the wrong he is doing. It is displayed in his depicting the poverty and neglect in his own England. It is displayed in his seeing the Soviet totalitarian system for what it is, and his understanding the danger to all of mankind, from doublespeak,doublethink, thoughtcontrol. It is displayed in his looking at the idealistic Gandhi and seeing how a pretence of perfection can lead to a certain kind of inhumanity. It is daring in whatever he writes to write clearly the plain truth- and to work very hard to make sure his language communicates and does not obfuscate.<br /><br />Orwell is important because he gives the example of the writer as courageous investigator of reality, and worker for the overall human good.	2005-02-01

There is also mediocre poetry. And I agree with one other reviewer who said that many of the poets read surprisingly poorly. They all should have listened to Dylan Thomas and learned from him. The power of his voice and the range of his feeling move greatly.<br /><br />I also was not overwhelmed by the various poetic appreciations. They seemed to me too subjective and did not add greatly to the knowledge of the poets under discussion.<br /><br />Yet with all the complaining the reading and listening to much of this poetry inspires to poetry. It lifts the mind and heart to another dimension in which there is a depth and a beauty to words which can be found nowhere else.<br /><br />This anthology has enough of such great poetry to be truly worthwhile.	2005-02-01

It is one of the best books ever written about the Soviet mind. The imprisonment of the former high official Rubashov, and his meditation on what he has done in his life, and what is happening to him is convincing and frightening. He has betrayed friends and those loyal to him for the society that is now betraying him. Through a long process of reasoning he comes to the conclusion that his life and the truth too must be sacrificed for the Good of the Society. Koestler thus shows how the total enslavement to the Collective Ideal leads to the loss of the individual's humanity. In telling this story he was criticizing Stalin's Soviet Union the largest prison Mankind has ever known. It would take a far greater writer than Koestler Solzhenitzyn to flesh out the details, and give in a more powerful and painful the story of that Gulag Archipelag that vast planet of Collective Subjugation of the individual which Koestler has convincingly condemned here.	2005-02-01

I think he analyzes in a very good way the whole thrust of Koestler's argument in trying to prove that Ashkenazi Jews are fundamentally not a Semitic people. He also brings to bear what I understand to be , the genetic testing on that matter which do show that Jews of all type have some kind of 'genetic connection between them.'<br /><br />I do not however understand one major thing i.e. why for Koestler it is important to show that the Jews are not Semitic. Is this to show that they are allegedly strangers in the Middle East, and so have no ' genetic right' (if there is such a thing) to the land of Israel.<br /><br />I join Mr. Mirsky in thinking that in some way the whole controversy aroused by this book, as to where the Jews have their origin is irrelevant. Judaism is a question of sharing a common tradition, faith, culture and therefore its 'racial component or preferably biological component' is secondary. What's important in regard to geography and every Jew, including Jewish converts is not what region of the world their ancestors may have come from but whether the eyes, minds and hearts are devoted  to realizing  the Biblical promise of return to the land of Israel.	2005-02-01

It provides the historical background to the emergence of his thought, and also outlines the historical role Confucius' teaching has had in the educational and political system of China. The first value of Confucius' is ' learning' and the educated Man is the ideal product and bureaucrat- administrator in the Chinese ruling system. Education and learning are for not for isolated ivory tower reality, but must be directed to social action. The Confucian teaching is generally regarded as secular and does not invoke ordinarily the supernatural. The focus is on human relationships and  considerable emphasis is given to ritual ( li). The Confucian ideal is for the person to show ' jen' which is a kind of respect and understanding of the other. The understanding ( shu) means something like putting oneself in the other's shoes and not doing to them what one would not want done to oneself. The emphasis on ' right action'in relation to others has special weight in family relations. The relation between parents and children, and between members of the family and older brother are given special emphasis. People are expected to show respect for their parents and provide for them in life, and also show respect for them when they are not in this world. The Confucian ideal became the norm for Chinese society for tens of generations and through the greatest share of Chinese history. When the Communists came to power in China they blamed the Confucian ideal for not having adjusted and trained China to be a part of the modern world. Yet in many ways Dawson makes clear the Confucian way of seeing the world remains strong in Chinese society. The strength of the Chinese family connection is evidenced throughout the large Diaspora of the Chinese.<br /><br />This is an excellent , clearly written introduction for someone like myself who knows very little about Chinese thought. The parallel to certain elements in Jewish thought ( The emphasis on learning, and on being a ' mensch' ( jen) are two apparent elements here is striking. But of course in Judaism the emphasis is on human relation to a personal God, and walking in the ways that God prescribes.<br /><br />In any case I highly recommend this small work.hasis on learning, and on being a ' mensch' ( jen) are two apparent elements here is striking.

It instead suggested that the real life of literature was not in this kind of study, but somewhere else where the private mind and imagination went on in its own way independent of building a body of objective knowledge.

The IWG also will announce the availability of additional records declassified under the Act and open to the public at the National Archives, College Park, Maryland.<br /><br />U.S. Intelligence and the Nazis demonstrates how the newly declassified documents alter and enhance our understanding of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War.

Highlights include files on the FBI's interaction with Nazis who immigrated to the U.S. and files on U.S. corporations that profited from dealings with the Nazis.<br /><br />-- 419 additional CIA Name and Subject files, bringing the total number opened by the IWG to nearly 800.<br /><br />-- More than 3,000 pages documenting the U.S. Army's involvement with German spymaster Reinhard Gehlen, whose post-war intelligence organization received U.S. funding to spy on the Soviet Union.<br /><br />There are other disclosures int he book.

The review I make here is thus not based on an up-to- date fresh reading but on the impressions that have remained with me in time. The first is the beauty and sensuality of the language , a kind of poetic richness which for many readers it seems is falsely lush but once struck me as true. Secondly, the exotic and mysterious world, the whole way Durrell succeeds in creating the atmosphere of a place. This also moved me and reminded me too of the way Camus succeeds in creating a feeling of Oran in the Plague. Durrell's Alexandria was so different from any world I had known that this mysterious quality was extremely strong for me. Thirdly, and this seemed especially problematic and puzzling to me then while perhaps now years later it is more familiar and yet still morally problematic. It is what might be called ' the 'mature and sophisticated approach to love'. When I read these book I very much had in mind a clear and simple model as ideal of love( I still do) as one man loves one woman and is loved by her in return. Here ' love- means something different , with feelings being broken up and directed to more than one person, with their being lack of mutuality in love. Certain aspects of this more mature world  remain somehow strange and morally discomfiting to me. Durrell's multiple perspectives , his retelling a story in more than one way, his seeing characters from a variety of viewpoints have it seems to me their corollary in Faulkner and Joyce. However Durrell's characters seem to me less ' solid' somehow and less substantial than Faulkner's or Joyce's. I must also say that while at certain points in the long reading there is a strong desire to know what happens next, and what will turn out with the characters- at some other point it becomes clear that their histories their actual 'fates' are not really the important thing for Durrell. He is painting a picture and the picture in words he is painting shifts its shape and form as it goes on and it will never even when the last word is written take on a final shape or form. The characters are elements in the picture and seem to dissolve as if too their final reality is as part of a landscape. Durrell I believe talks at some point about some kind of new four- dimensional Einsteinian picture of human character and that picture seems to leave no place for old time three- dimensional character.<br /><br />All in all there remains a me a vague sense of a strange world somehow distant and appealing , and poetically rich but forever remote .<br /><br />Is this great literature? It seems to me that it might be. But I don't really know. Is it interesting writing and a way of seeing things extremely new for me and I believe for most readers? Definitely yes. Is this book for everybody?

No doubt he did see ' social phenomenom' that were emerging and succeeded in finding the 'name ' for them. 'Leisure class' and ' conspicuous consumption' are part of the everyday vocabulary of the description and analysis of 'social life'. I know that Veblen was particularly hard upon the nouveau riche, those trying to prove by buying and having more that they were as good or better than ' old money'. However I wonder if in ' work ethic' America there is not also another kind of phenomenom, of people of great wealth feeling a special social obligation, as multibillionaires Gates and whether for good purposes or not, Ted Turner have displayed in recent years. I also have  a  problem with making the concept of ' leisure' an entirely pejorative one. What about those ' surpluses' at the state of the agricultural age which Lewis Mumford said were so key in creating civilization? Isn't it true that in many  societies those who do not have to do productive work were freed for higher work of mind and spirit?  I wonder then that is whether Veblen's condemnation of the 'leisure class ' is too ' blanket' a one in many ways. And this without denying the truths that great wealth often corrupts, leads to arrogance, and indolence, folly and waste.  For years the conception of the US was of a society in which the middle class element was predominant, a society reflecting an equality of opportunity and the fact that the majority of people had been able to in time and through work raise themselves to a good level of life. The decline of the middle class in the sense of the growing gap between very rich and very poor is a fact of life in America. Perhaps this makes Veblen's analysis of a certain part of American society more pertinent. But again I think that there is a counter- tradition emerging in which many of the very wealthy assume that the way to real respect in the eyes of the public is in doing good for others.to real respect in the eyes of the public is in doing good for others.  <br />	2005-01-30

Most of the articles were initially given in a symposium on the subject at Bar- Ilan University.  The opening essay by Elie Wiesel on ' Prayer and Modern Man' is an invaluable look at the dilemna of Jewish prayer in a world which has known the Shoah. Wiesel in one insight talks about the Rabbi of Kotzk who in the ' Al Rachum' ( Merciful G-d) prayer says that what we are saying is not that G-d is Merciful now but rather praying that G-d will be merciful in the future. Wiesel who understands as well as anyone the difficulty of prayer nonetheless argues for its necessity. Prayer he finds to be a form of Jewish connection with previous generations and the tradition as a whole , an act as it were of collective Jewish solidarity. The other essays are by outstanding scholars, Dov Sadan, Jakob Petuchowski, Joseph Heinemann, Joseph Tabory, Eliezer Schweid, Marvin Fox, Ephraim Gottlieb, Moshe Schwartz, Adin Steinsaltz, Uriel Simon, Jules Harlow. There is also a symposium  with Joseph Heinemann, Harold Fisch, Akiva Ernst Simon, Yehudah Nini, Yehudah Friedlander, Yohanan Silman, Eliezer Berkovits, Rivkah Katz, Yehudah Moriel, Moshe Litov, and the volume's editor Gabriel Cohn. This symposium is on ' Jewish Prayer in Our Days' and one of the focal issues is whether the Jewish prayerbook the Siddur should have emendations reflecting  the Holocaust  the founding of the State of Israel.The volume concludes with Agnon's short- story 'My New Prayer Book'.<br /><br />One of the interesting aspects of the anthology is the essays on prayer as conceived respectively by  Yehudah HaLevi, the Rambam, the Spanish Kabbalah, and Franz Rosenzweig.<br /><br />This work is highly recommended. And I think should go on a list with the books by Yitzhak Buxbaum ( Jewish Spiritual Practices)<br /><br />Seth Kadish ( Kavvanah) Elie Munk, Adin Steinsaltz as truly helpful guides to understanding prayer, and hopefully prayer in a deeper and truer way.

His wisdom does not strike you suddenly like Kafka's definition of poetry an axe breaking through the frozen sea- within. Nietzsche one of the greatest of aphorists surprises, outrages, shocks and wakens you. His aphorisms are read and reread whereas Goethe's maxims are a minor part of his oeuvre.

Rebbe Nachman said \\" When you pray, hold nothing back from God.

And this when the Hebrew word ( tefilah) has in it the meaning of self- reflection and examination in moving closer to God.<br /><br />I believe that these prayers can inspire and help in many different situations .There are prayers on ' loss' and on' arrogance' and on 'living to the fullest ' and on ' joy' and on ' healing ' and on ' crying and sighing' and on ' true nourishment' and on ' giving' and on much much more.<br /><br />A wonderful little book to take with one everywhere, and from time to time dip in, for inspiration and spiritual strengthening.	2005-01-29

Goethe initially conceived in 1797 but finished only a few months before his death in 1832. It contains his essential message to the world. The work is considered more philosophical and poetic than dramatic, and is rarely staged. Among the problems I have with it are the line- by - line poetry. Wayne's translation may be one of the finest( I am in no position to judge) but it does not read to me as if great poetry. Goethe is said to be for German be as Dante for Italian, and Pushkin for Russian the one who most completely defines the literary language. Supposedly the nuances and tones of Faust are an encyclopedia of human mood and disposition. As a reader of this work I did not get this. I also did not find in the work sympathetic characters or a story that could be made much sense of . I found  a strange mythology, a Walpurgisnacht, a panoply of mythical beings who do not arouse human sympathy.<br /><br />And this brings me to Faust himself, who without Gretchen( dead in part one) comes in the end to a certain form of redemption. This redemption through working for the common good ( as opposed to selfishly seeking his own pleasures and power as Faust has all along) is the great wisdom of the end. The Faust who errs and continues to try , who persists is rewarded for his persistence and salvation will be his. 'For he whose strivings never cease / Is ours for his redeeming.'In the words of Goethe as quoted in the introduction to this volume \\" In these lines the key to Faust's salvation is contained. in Faust himself there is an activity mounting ever higher and purer to the end,and from above eternal love which helps him in his need. All this is completely in harmony with our religious conceptions,according to which we enter bliss, not by our own strength alone, but by the divine grace vouchsafed to us.' p.11<br /><br />Goethe is that rare exception the so- called ' happy genius' and he grants to his much tormented hero and in some sense alter ego, ' Faust' the happy ending of salvation.<br /><br />Perhaps the reader of this work who has persisted in reading it from beginning to end should also be given a bit of 'salvation' for his effort. For in my case anyway the pleasure in the reading all along , was not that great.his much tormented hero and in some sense alter ego, ' Faust' the happy ending of salvation.  <br />Perhaps the reader of this work who has persisted in reading it from beginning to end should also be given a bit of 'salvation' for his effort.

In these years his literary output contracted. The trip to Italy was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream, a dream inspired in part by his own father's earlier journey and love of Italy. In Italy Goethe found yet another side of his multifaceted self . He opened to the world and the light and to sensuous reality. His connection with Nature is a fundamental theme of his poetry and in Italy he found a Nature which seemed imbued with organic form and Art , and an Art imbued with Nature. In a sense leaving home enabled him to come home to a central side of himself.<br /><br />Goethe was a writer- scientist- artist whose central theme was his own inner development. This development took a dramatic turn for the good, and these journals of his Italian trip are a central part of ' the great confession' which was his work.	2005-01-28

Loftus is really telling us here something about the origins of Islamic terror, about the Wahahabi regime in Saudi Arabia's adoption of Nazi propaganda in its war against the Jews. This war against the Jews has become a war against the West. Loftus shows how the Dulleses' and the State Department contributed to the policy of covering up for the Saudis. This policy has led to US concealing the fierce anti - US policy of the Saudi educational system.In other words he gives the roots of Sept. 11, 2001 in which fifteen of the terrorists were Saudi nationals. Even today the war on terror being conducted by the Bush administration throughout the Middle East makes a strange exception in not taking on one of the major bankrollers of terror, the Saudis.<br /><br />Loftus correctly identifies the enemies of the Jews as the enemy of human freedom. And he indicates that failures of the whole Western espionage system have contributed to this. This book was written well before 9/1`1 and is prophetic in sensing that it might come.<br /><br />Loftus book is implicitly a wake- up call to the people of the West to begin to understand who their enemies are, and work in a forceful way to defeat them.	2005-01-28

As Reed understands it Goethe's direct experience of nature was immediately transformed into poetry. Goethe sought and found in Nature inherent and organic development, the very process which shaped the world and his own inner life into wholeness. Reed traces Goethe's literary career from the sensational success of Werther through the period of Wilhelm Meister, then the period of plays, the ten years of virtual silence in Weimar, then the Italian journey and renewal toward the final development of Faust. He shows how Goethe despite uneasy times, and difficult moods lived truly the life of the happy genius, achieving a kind of harmony and wholeness which is rare among great creators.<br /><br />This is an excellent work though there is a feeling of special pleading in the championing of works of art which however much they resound with readers of German do not seem to have attracted a real readership in the world today.	2005-01-27

Bulka has written an informative work on the Jewish conception of Pleasure. His main idea is that the Jewish view scorns both asceticism and hedonism and favors a balanced attitude toward Pleasure. He illustrates this through his nine chapters. The first details the context in which the topic is treated. The second discusses the obligation to maintain one's health, and the third centers on avoiding pain. The fourth chapter explores depression and mental anguish, and Jewish<br /><br /> teachings in regard to them. Chapter five deals with the experience of Pleasure itself. Chapter six with enjoying life and making it pleasurable for others. Chapter seven on the pleasures of food and chapter eight on sensual pleasure.<br /><br />Rabbi Bulka concludes as follows\\" Judaism on pleasure, the essential Jewish statement about pleasure, may read like this: Enjoy life, find and give meaning to all aspects and conditions of life in accordance with the life- affirming guidelines of the Torah, and you will experience tthe feeling of being pleased.<br /><br />This is at once, the pleasure principle as well as its high- yield interest.\\"  p.168	2005-01-27

Moynihan says that this study is only for those who believe that Thomas at very least wrote a handful of great poems. Drawing on previous studies and especially on Thomas letters  Moynihan illuminates the work of Thomas. He shows how Thomas is often an unreliable reader of his own poetry, and also makes a strong case for Thomas a deeply religious poet. He connects the ' life force' in Thomas with that in D.H. Lawrence shows Thomas connection to the Welsh countryside and bardic tradition.He also shows how conscienscious a craftsman Thomas was and how he fashioned in his collected poems a work of great symbolic and mythic unity. In his summary Moynihan maintains that one year before his death Thomas 'had, for all practical purposes completed his vision of the human condition, the unity of birth, fall and regeneration. Imperfect, truncated, and ambiguous in many particulars, 'Collected Poems' nevertheless marks a completed esthetic. The highly imaginative existence revealed in this esthetic together with his singular importance as a neo- romantic poetand his score of superb lyric poems, mark Dylan Thomas as one of a half dozen major poets writing in English in the first half of our century.\\"<br /><br />This is a very rich study and will be of considerable help to readers of Thomas.	2005-01-27

He was the son of a provincial office and was himself slated to be that. Instead he wandered off to Paris, had a number of patrons , tried to write great and noble verses but had his one great success with the Fables. The Fables taken from Aesop, and the Indian fabulist Bidpai were written in verse. They were published in two volumes, the first of which is considered the superior. They often take a kind of dual subject form, i.e. the this and the that, the Cicada and the Ant, the Crow and the Fox , the Wolf and the Lamb.James Michie's translation is according ton Geoffrey Grigson who introduces this volume the best one.  But I do not feel it really succeeds as poetry.I read the little one- dimensional stories as prose. They have a touch of the cruelty Fables often have and the stories and morals do not most often  rise above the commonplace. But generations have read and enjoyed these fables and what is my taste that it should argue against them?	2005-01-27

Gurary teaches that the Jew has before birth prior knowledge of God, and that the belief in God is therefore inherent in every Jewish soul. As he understands it all Torah is a manifestation of God, and the learning of the thirteen principles of faith is what he calls ' experiential'and not simply abstract reasoning. Each of the chapters is a meditation on one of the thirteen principles. There is too a chapter on Faith itself, Faith and Experience, Faith and Reason, Faith and Self- Sacrifice, Faith and Life et. al.<br /><br />The last principle is Resurrection of the Dead and I would like to quote Gurary's closing words in the hope that they may be of some help and inspiration to anyone who reads this.<br /><br />\\"Perhaps the reason that Maimonedes final principle is about the resurrection of the dead is in accordance with the maxim\\" that the beginning is wedged in theend, and the end in the beginning'.<br /><br />Rightin the beginning we explained that belief in God comes from God Himself, that God Himself is revealed to the soul We conclude with the idea that the relationship  of God to the Jewish person as a whole,comprising both soul and body , will ultimately be revealed in the era of the resurrection of the dead. Thus we see that the Essence of God  is connected in every way to the life of the Jew in this world.As explained by Chasidus, the final principle emphasizes that this intrinsic connection is everlasting and will ultimately be revealed forever. In this sense, there is no end. The final principle explains how there is no end.'<br /><br />This work was compiled and edited by Moshe Miller.	2005-01-27

Rotenstreich, a Kant scholar, finds the sources of the idea, and the contexts in which it is employed to be 'eclectic' And in this work he analyzes in it in relation to the idea of Man's being a creature created in the image of God, in connection with elements of human creativity, in relation to morality, and also in relation to human sanctity.<br /><br />The concept of human dignity is one which has been greatly evoked in the recent bioethical debates especially by the moral philosopher Leon Kass.<br /><br />This book provides valuable insight into an essential concept for human self- understanding.	2005-01-27

In it he tries to introduce philosophical problems and ideas to a wider audience. The written text of the book was based on the transcripts of the talks. But these were worked on considerably both by Magee and those he interviewed. The effort was to make as readable a text as possible and to eliminate the repetitions, the paraphanelia of speech. He opens the dialogues with a talk with Sir Isaiah Berlin on the question of why anyone should take an interest in Philosophy. Berlin talks about the way we all live with assumptions which when questioned philosophically undermine our security. And he indicates that as one possible reason why so many avoid philosophy. On the other hand he says when there is no questioning when all is taken as it is , the mind and imagination dry up. In these lectures Magee does not allow the mind and imagination to dry up. He engages in dialogue with many of the most prominent philosophers of our time beginning with Berlin, and then Charles Taylor, Herbert Marcuse, William Barrett, Anthony Quinton, A.J. Ayer, Bernard Williams, R.M. Hare, W.V. Quine, John Searle, Noam Chomsky, Hilary Putnam, Ronald Dworkin, Iris Murdoch, Ernest Gellner. He tries to be inclusive in these talks and have representatives of all the major schools of philosophy, and representatives of all the major areas. To my mind there is an over- representation of the analystic and positivistic type of thinker, but this is perhaps indicative of the character of philosophy today.<br /><br />This is a very good introduction to basic problems of philosophy.<br /><br />Parenthetically, the fact that this review is the first of the book posted on 'Amazon' would seem to me a small piece of evidence in support of Berlin's thesis that the mass of mankind would rather not have their own assumptions question and their own beliefs tested.	2005-01-27

While it presents a chapter on Pascal's mathematical and scientific achievements its focus is on the work through which Pascal has influenced Western religious thought, and still has significance today, ' The Pensees'.  Krailsheimer shows how Pascal was a close reader of Montaigne, understood the value of his skepticism in regard to the human capacity to alone achieve absolute truth. Pascal complemented his reading of Pascal with a reading of the Stoics whose fortitude he admired while despising their ethical passivity. For Pascal the answer to the skeptics and Stoics was in that Christian faith which gave human life a possibility in salvation. Krailsheimer explains the great Pascalian wager the choice between two uncertainties one which leads to nothing, and one which leads to infinite life. The story of Pascal's dramatic conversion and his choice 'of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and not of the philosophers' is also told here.	2005-01-26

But for those women who do care about pleasing their husbands it seems to me some of these rules might help. Most of them are really ' common sense' . Among them are\\"  Relax During the Engagement and Wedding,Continue to be a Creature Unlike any other, Keep up your Looks- But don't go Crazy- Keep up your own Interests- Lower your expectations in the first year( I suspect this is a big one) Be A team, Give him fifteen minutes alone when he comes home, Be supportive, Accept some things are none of your business, Try not to call him too much at work, Rarely return his gifts, Don't expect a lot of sympathy from your husband,  Say what you mean , but don't say it Meanly.

Classical Judaism in Glazer's coneption stands 'first of all for Torah, for learning which is more than for knowledge but rather a ' bridge between the human and the divine'. Classical Judaism in the relations between people requires more than justice, it requires 'hesed, acts of loyalty, mercy , loving concern , a spirit of renunciation and conciliation.  Classical Judaism requires help for and consideration of the poor. It requires the living by Hillel's great law of ' what is hateful to you do not do to another'. Classical Judaism as Glazer defines it welcomes proselytes, has a loving spirit to mankind, is critical of militarism, and power- politics, and also the deterioration morally of the traditional priesthood. Glazer claims that Hillel's Judaism is close to the common man and his needs.<br /><br />This is an excellent small study that bases itself on the Mishnaic sources, especially on Avot.	2005-01-26

These responses with their frequent delight at bashing the Jews are in a way more distressing than the Finklestein book itself. Also the fact that the most anti- Semitic responses were given ' voted for' by the majority of Amazon readers of this particular item is a cause for great concern. It may well be that anti-Semites are simply more attracted to a Jew- bashing book like this, while a much larger proportion of decent people simply turn their attention to more pleasant items. I do not know. It is a well- known fact that one of the negatives of easy Internet publication is not simply the publication of vast amounts of drivel written by incompetents, but also the publication of vast amounts of hate- literature written by various kinds of bigots, including anti- Semites.<br /><br />Norman Finkelstein is such a purveyor of hate- literature. He is intelligent and sophisticated, but underneath it all he knows that what he is doing is insulting the memory of the victims of and  the survivors. He knows that the overwhelming majority of survivors of the Holocaust are strong supporters of Israel, and so he understands when he condemns Israel he is insulting them. He knows they too are extremely sensitive to criticism of the Jewish community and so when he criticizes it he is hurting them.<br /><br />One might say that he nonetheless has an obligation to ' the truth' and therefore if he has discovered something wrong with the way Jewish organizations have dealt with the reparations issue he has an obligation to tell that truth. If it were only however this simple. For what one repeatedly sees in the writing of Finklestein is a vicious hatred of Israel and the organized Jewish community. There is also in addition a despicable hatred of the one nation in the world which has done more for the good of mankind than any other, the United States of America .<br /><br />Finkelstein also slanders individuals including the most well- known witness of the Holocaust, the human rights activist and Nobel Prize Winner Elie Wiesel. Finkelstein does not deserve to have his name mentioned in the same sentence with Wiesel. Wiesel is a courageous and consciencious individual whose story of his own experience in the Holocaust ' Night'is one of the most moving human documents ever written. Wiesel has spent a lifetime battling for human rights throughout the world and is a hero of mankind. Finkelstein's attack on Wiesel is shameful.<br /><br />As for Finklestein's major argument as to there being a ' Holocaust Industry ' this is too insulting and offensive from the outset. There was a Murder Industry of the Nazis which destroyed one third of the Jewish people .This Industry also confiscated tremedous amounts of property . The efforts by Jewish organizations to recover some small part of that and provide some of the victims in their old age with compensation have never seemed to me anything but a marginal footnote to the Holocaust story. The Holocaust story is the millions of dead, and injured, the countless incidents of cruelty and suffering. It is also the effort of the survivors to make new lives for themselves, and to try insofar as possible to restore human hope and dignity to themselves. The state of Israel enabled many of those survivors to make new lives for themselves. Their rehabilitation is one of the few encouraging signs in this story. That Finklestein, who is a propagandist for Palestinian Arab terror, dares to condemn the state which has done the most for restoring the souls and the lives of the victims is hypocritical and disgusting.<br /><br />This book has made many Anti-Semites happy, and may even create a few new ones. But decent , fair - minded people, Jewish and not - Jewish alike will see through it for what is , a bigoted propaganda propogated by a cruel and inhuman exploiter of his own people's suffering.eople's suffering.     <br />	2005-01-26

And he asks the great man questions about his art and his view of the world. Goethe is usually very interesting , and gives information and insight which can be gotten nowhere else. In one exhange he for instance explains why his works cannot be ' popular' but are suited for readers are a certain special kind of mind and heart. In another he utters these well known words about his life and art.<br /><br /> \\"I have ever been esteemed one of Fortune's chiefest favourites; nor will I complain or find fault with the course my life has taken. Yet, truly, there has been nothing but toil and care; and I may say that, in all my seventy-five years, I have never had a month of genuine comfort. It has been the perpetual rolling of a stone, which I have always had to raise anew. My annals will render clear what I now say. The claims upon my activity, both from within and without, were too numerous.<br /><br />My real happiness was my poetic meditation and production. But how was this disturbed, limited and hindered by my external position! Had I been able to abstain more from public business, and to live more in solitude, I should have been happier, and should have accomplished more as a poet.\\"<br /><br />This is a vital source book for understanding one of the world's great geniuses.	2005-01-26
373187:US	20595117	RVXFD7H1K246C	0192875779	895559541	Kant (Past Masters)	Books	5	9	12	N	N	What I understood of it seemed excellent	I once had a physics teacher the late Dave Levinstein of blessed memory  who when asked by a student about relativity theory said the following; \\"I read some of that Einstein stuff, but the truth is , I didn't get it.\\" That's very much the way I feel about a lot of this book. I did read with interest Scruton's account of Kant's life in which it turns out that the man his neighbors set their clocks by was also a quite sociable human being, and very much appreciated by his local townspeople. Kant who came from a poor family and who worked very hard all his life worked himself up in the system from private teacher to professor. He was an enormously popular lecturer, who drew standing room crowds. His heart was above all in metaphysics, but he also lectured at many other subjects including astronomy . Scruton says that he is the most important philosopher of modernity, and in purely philosophical ( philosophers between philosophers) terms this may be correct. He is not however a very congenial writer, and reading him trying to paraphrase his abstractions into your own. I have tried 'The Critique of Pure Reason' a few times and never really felt I was getting it. How liberating it is after reading Kant to read a great literary stylist like Nietzsche. In any case in this short work Scruton does outline and summarize the three great critiques. He shows how Kant's religious position in a certain way grows out of his Aesthetics and his sense of something sublime and transcendent. He underlines the Kantian position that it is the categories of our mind which shape our experience, and it is our experience which we know. And this means 'Reality- in - Itself' is transcendent and beyond our own apprehension.<br /><br />This work seems to me a good introduction and summary. But again I do not feel I really understand Kant, at least not in any depth. The happy philosophical reader however might gain in understanding through reading and rereading this small work.	2005-01-26

Is the writer responsible for the harmful results of his work , when he did not intend those results at all? Is there some moral fault in Goethe for writing a work which led to the suicides of many young people?<br /><br />I do not know the answer.<br /><br />'The Sorrows of Werther' a story of obsessive and doomed love is told in the form of letters sent from Werther to his friend William. The infatuation with which he begins in time turns to a maddening obsession from which he cannot free himself. 'Love or Death' is the choice, and the choice becomes Death.<br /><br />I confess that my own attitude upon reading this work even as a young person was somewhat distant and ironic. Perhaps unfairly Goethe represented to me and represents the height of that enlightened cultured Germany , the Germany of Bach,Mozart, Beethoven, Kant which  in the twentieth century descended into absolute barbarism and was responsible for one of  great crimes in human history, the Holocaust. Reading this story with that immense Horror in the background the story seems like a kind of toy, a kind of poor joke not to be taken very seriously. Who can possibly care about one lovesick little yokel when the pictures of concentration camps are in the mind?<br /><br />Iknow the work swept Europe and was highly innovative in its day. I know it is considered a classic of German and Western Literature. But for me this story has no emotional resonance whatever. Perhaps this is unfair, but perhaps it too indicates that reviews are written by people who have their own histories and memories.

She writes about Joyce's love life and she tells the story of his infidelities and his complicated relationship to his wife Nora without going into each particular incident at length. She has an interesting few pages on reader reaction to ' Ulysses' including Virginia Woolf's comment calling it ' underbred, the effort of a ' queasy undergraduate scratching his pimples' In this work O'Brien often generalizes insightfully about the writer's condition in general, maintaining controversially that the more dedicated the writer is , and the more capable of seeing into the feeling of others on the page, the more monstrous the writer becomes in life. She compares Joyce's lonely end with that of Tolstoy, O'Neill, Virginia Woolf and Dickens. She says ,\\"A writer and especially a great writer, feels both more and less about human grief, being at once celebrant, witness and victim.

It begins with the first movement of Indo- European peoples into Iran and traces the story to today's regime of the Mullahs. It in tracing this history which is largely the history of a vast empires it reveals a great deal about Iranian national character. According to Pollack the Iranians have the arrogance of those who have been a great imperial power. They too as a power which has been conquered more than once have a real suspiciousness toward the world outside. This extends also to their Sunni Muslim brothers as Iran is at present  the only Shiite regime in the world. Pollack is an especially good narrator of Iran's historical development. But his real focus and aim is to provide the reader with the background to the present American - Iranian relationship. In this regard he focuses in later chapters on the overthrow of the Mossedaqh regime in 1953 and the American embassy takeover in Tehran which helped cause the downfall of the Carter Administration. Pollack in his last chapter tries to outline the options for United States action towards Iran. And the Persian puzzle of the title is the puzzle of how to work out properly these relations. The United States and Iran are totally estranged from each other. Iran is according to the US State Department the largest state- supporter of terror in the world. Iran is according to many observers a supporter of anti- American action in Iraq. And Iran has been working for years clandestinely to develop its own nuclear option. Here one should understand what the Israeli scholar Ephraim Kam has pointed out in his study of Iranian military development in the past thirty years. The tremendous trauma of the Iraq war in which Iranians were subject to non- conventional gas warfare by the Iraqis is one of the major elements impelling them to the nuclear option. But the Iranians also wish to balance and counter US power. The Iranians conceive of the nuclear option as a means of driving the US from the region , and Israel out of the world entirely. The Iranians are steadily working to increase the range of their missiles and parts of Europe may already be in their reach. Their long- range goal is to be able to reach not only US troops in the Mideast but heartland America. One of Pollack's central points is the tremendous importance of containing Iran. He is not however certain that this can be done now. He believes that the Iranians have so scattered and placed underground their nuclear facilities that the US may simply not have a viable option of preemption. He is even more emphatically against the possibility of a US land- invasion of Iran which he believes would be a great mistake. Iran is four- times the size of Iraq and is a much more formidable force to contend with in every way. The US is as it is now over- extended, and so Pollack does not believe the military invasion option is a real one. Pollack argues for the US making a combined effort with European allies, and others offering Iran incentives , economic and otherwise in order to forestall or at least contain a nuclear Iran. This method of dialogue  is the approach of the Germany France Great Britain and thIAEA now, and there is no sign that it is working. Iran has a strong Russian connection( The Russians are building their nuclear facility at Bushehr) and more especially an increasingly closer relationship with China.China has already indicated it would veto any sanction effort against Iran in the U.N.  US sanctions have been in place against Iran for some time now and have only worked to encourage Iran to deepen its Russian and Chinese connections. Thus the path of dialogue despite its being urged by many US foreign policy experts does not seem likely to stop Iran . Pollack indicates that there is strong opposition to the Iranian regime from the people .And that over a long - period it is possible to hope that the regime may be overturned. But the nuclear clock is ticking faster than that. And the nuclear issue is the one issue on which the regime has the total backing of its citizens. This may not only because they feel threatened by having the US nearby but even more importantly, psychologically, because they feel as a great empire nuclear weapons are their right. In any case Pollack is honest and realistic in assessing the difficult situation the US finds itself in - in  trying to understand how to relate properly to Iran. However his suggestion that the US might be wise to rely on deterrence, and accept the coming into being of a nuclear Iran seems a particularly unwise one. There is a general consensus of non- proliferation experts that a nuclear Iran will lead to a nuclear Saudi Arabia and a nuclear Egypt, and a world far more dangerous. There is even the suggestion that it will break down completely all non-proliferation agreements, and trigger a world- wide nuclear arms race. A nuclear Iran would have greater power over its Gulf neighbors who already are threatened by it. Therefore it would seem that Pollack is right in not completely foreclosing a preemptive action( not to take over the territory of Iran) but to stop it or delay it for years from becoming nuclear. The exercise of such an option might too be incentive for regime change in Tehran though such an outcome is by no means guaranteed.<br />Another dimension of the Iranian- US relation is of course in the context of the US struggle against Terror worldwide.Iran is an ideologically driven state whose declared aim is the export of the Islamic revolution throughout the world.<br />Pollack's book is an outstanding guide to the overall history and development of Iran. It provides some of the options for possible US action vis- a- vis Iran in the future. But here it is by no means comprehensive or definitive. And it is to be hoped that the Intelligence Services of the United States ( and perhaps too Israel) have a good enough picture of what is happening in Iran to ensure that a nuclear Iran does not come into being which will threaten the world as a whole. Iran at present is driven both by memories of its own past historical grandeur and by fundamentalist religous callings. Its hostility as Bernard Lewis has pointed out in other contexts to the US is not simply military and religious but cultural and moral. It does not seem then that the word ' compromise'is most suited for dealing with the Iranian Revolutionary Islamic Regime now. What does seem more hopeful is the idea that Iran has many strands in its rich past. And that at some point these strands will once again come to the fore .ear clock is ticking faster than that.

The climax is in the chapter on Troilus and Cressida ' called ' From Master Craftsman to Philosopher' and from the chapter on 'The Canterbury Tales' called 'The Human Tragicomedy'. In writing of the creation of the Canterbury Tales he says \\"Chaucer accepted that he was temperamentally incapable of competing with a poem as egoistic as the Divine Comedy; he would experiment with another concept of comedy radically differentiated from Dante's kind first by the self- effacement of the poet, and second by the absence of judgment and condemnation like that which Dante had people his ' Inferno'.<br /><br />Kane develops a clear line in understanding the development of Chaucer. However he in doing so fails to consider the Robertson- Huppe interpretation of Chaucer which sees him as a fundamentally Christian artist. He too in seeming to vie for the alternative of a sophisticated, secular skeptical Chaucer precludes another perception of his world - view. The Chaucer scholar Sheila Delany has written about Chaucer's ' skeptical fideism' in which he believes in Christian doctrine and at the same time has a skeptical attitude.<br /><br />Kane's volume is a good one but by no means comprehensive even in regard to the main outline of the Chaucer story. It is interesting that he writes of the last period of Chaucer's life as one in which he is disappointed, and has voluntarily given up writing. Most recently a line of thought has emerged suggesting that Chaucer was in fact assassinated for political reasons.	2005-01-25

Begin was a modest, courageous leader dedicated to achieving freedom for the Jewish people in the land of Israel. Time and again he made decisions which overcame his own narrow interest and served the people of Israel. One was in his decision not to fight back after the attack on the Atalena. Years later in events outside the scope of this book Begin in opposition backed the government fully in decisions of great weight and moment, such as the taking of the Old City in 1967 or the operation in Entebbe in 1976 . Here he tells of a troubled time in Jewish history when a desperate people struggled to realize a two thousand year old dream of restoring Jewish sovereignty in the land of Israel. This is a highly readable work by a leader who the people of Israel loved perhaps more than any other in modern times.	2005-01-24

Oz is a tremendously powerful and beautiful speaker and reader of Hebrew. These lectures sounded not so much like academic criticism but as a kind of long prose-poem. I do not know Agnon's work well- enough to argue with the reading Oz makes of it. Agnon was a religious Jew who was deep inside the Tradition as is evidenced in some of the anthology work he did especially ' Days of Awe' . Oz has gone somewhere else, and does not have Agnon's midrashic and talmudic background. Yet the thesis that Oz proposes in regard to the contradiction between the ideals of the religious and Zionist return to the land, and the reality which was met and made in the Yishuv is a very real one. It is also true that Agnon's work is a chronicle of the collapse of Eastern Jewry written before the great destruction comes. Oz knows the Agnon text well, and his power as writer makes it seems as if his reading of Agnon is the most convincing one. I think however it should be balanced against the reading of other commentators including Baruch Kurzweil, Arnold Band, Hillel Weiss and a host of others.<br /><br />However reading this work of Oz will give not only knowledge of two of the Hebrew language's greatest writers in modern times ( Agnon and Oz) it will illuminate the whole ideological dimension of the Jewish return to Eretz Yisrael.	2005-01-24

But the farming world of Per Hansa, the many complications of his family's  and neighbors' life struck me as in some way alien.

I can't apply Jack Canfield's principles. I don't look to bother people and so I cannot ask them repeatedly for something. I often am mixed up as to what I want, and don't really focus on one goal. If I do get ahead a bit I feel sorry for all those who do not , and want to not succeed. I don't care to be rich and have a lot of money. What I would sort of like to do is help people feel that even though they are old, ugly, stupid, and failures they are still human beings worthy of consideration and kindness. I guess I am just a big old failure who will never get anywhere . Nonetheless it is nice to know that there are principles of success and some people can use them and become rich and happy.

This book is a real pleasure to read. Rabbi Telushkin not only tells some wonderful jokes he analyzes them in an interesting way. In his preface he notes that Jews do not joke about everything but have a certain set of subjects from verbal aggresiveness, to professional ambition which they persistently joke about. His message in the book is that the Jews joking about themselves tell a lot about their values, and that their jokes are really a mirror to the soul. So it is not surprising that one of the main subjects if the close relation of parents and children, and the tremendous worry pressure love concern parents show for their children. Telushkin does not develop an overall theory of Jewish humor though he of course notes that laughing at oneself is often a way of protecting oneself from the insults of others. An it is too a way of bringing about a kind of group or communal solidarity. Those that can laugh with me are really my friends. The fact that Jews so specialize in laughing at themselves Telushkin points out also contributes to their having had a predominant role in ' comedy in America.  He cites the long list of Jewish comedians from the old line Burns, Groucho and other Marxes , Jack Benny , through the Milton Berle, Henny Youngman Phil Silvers down to the Seinfeld  Billy Chrystal generation. Anyone who leaves out Alan King Jerry Lewis Buddy Hackett should of course be castigated for this. In any case the main point about this book is ' Try it you'll like it' Once in the Subway there used to be an add which went ' You don't have to be Jewish to like Levi's ryebread' I think the same might be said about this book. You don't have to be Jewish ( though it probably helps) to get many a good laugh out of this excellent work.	2005-01-24

It is based on an earlier version of the play by Euripides. It is written at a relatively late period in Racine's career when he was moving back toward Jansensim and a fully religious life. The play is considered the most perfect French example of  a tragedy written according to the classic rules. The story is one of illicit passion and its price.

This cruelty of the gods somehow suits the whole tenor of Racine's work which has a certain fierce kind of cruelty in it.

Upon receiving a message that Theseus has died Phaedra contain contain her passion and confesses her love to a horrified Hippolytus. Then it is revealed that the message of Theseus dead like Mark Twain's has been premature. Theseus returns and urged on by her wicked servant Oenone Phaedra indicates that Hippolytus has attempted to seduce her. Outraged Theseus orders that his son be executed.

It has to do with their great musical quality, the richness of vocabulary and language, polyphonic beauty in their long lines. Keats' letters are among the greatest in the language and help define  not only his own poetic practice, but make a real contribution to literary theory in general. Stevens' letters do illuminate various aspects of his art but they seem to me to be on a wholly different level entirely from the poetry. The banker- businessman- husband is a much more pedestrian soul than the poet. The Letters are of great value to any student or scholar of Stevens, but they are not on the literary level of his great poetry.<br /><br />He was however or so I have the impression of from these letters a devoted father to his daughter. This at least gives a sense that the value of his life was not only in the great poetry he created.	2005-01-23

And why link with them Crane and Twain? True their best books are chosen and so of these four great American masters we have the best books of three.

Each one of the four works here is a small world in itself.<br /><br />Hester Prynne ( A Scarlet Letter) Huck, Henry Fleming , and Billy Budd each is put through a kind of moral test.

This particular little piece of ' Look at the anarchic dismal impersonal civilization we live in' school has a touch of the randonmness and violence which Kosinki's world is pervaded by.The story of the gardener whose guardian dies and who has to encounter the ' real world' for the first time gives no sense of any redeeming moment or beauty in life. One might say that Becket doesn't either and that is his genius. But I have the sense that the emptiness which Kosinki finds at the heart of 'Television Civilization's is an emptiness in the heart of Kosinski himself.<br /><br />Unfairly perhaps I think of Tolstoy and that kind of fiction which makes the person love life more, not wonder why one is reading something which makes one wonder if life really is so worthless and so small.	2005-01-23

I read this book with the hope of understanding the direction in which History is moving. The historical analysis of the decline of the Hapsburgs or the travails of the Napoleonic era interested far less than did the last chapter devoted to giving some sense of the world at the time the book was written. 1987. At that time and even perhaps more so now there is endless talk and debate about the question of whether the world's only superpower is moving toward greater hegemony, or perhaps to decline and then disaster. One only needs to survey the attitudes of most nations to the United States today to see that it has never been more hated and demonized than today. Kennedy is more interested in analysis of economic, military and ultimately political relations. The implicit conclusion of his book made by most readers at the time it was first published was that he was really predicting an inevitable American decline. In other words all the historical chapters were really preparation for the speculative chapter on America's future. And this though Kennedy made certain to hedge and distinguish clearly between the historical analysis and the speculation.<br /><br />Now as I write this in January 2005 a couple of days after President Bush's second inaugural calling for a new birth of liberty throughout the world I wonder what Kennedy surmises. The great US productivity boom that came in the nineties, the great prosperity, the total military dominance displayed by the US seemed to suggest that Kennedy's picture of US decline was mistaken. But today in a time of massive deficit budgets, with an economically revived and increasingly powerful Europe, with China growing at such a rapid rate there is the question of how long the superpower can hold on. The emeging great superpower China seems to be threatening US interests in many places, and perhaps will eventually replace it as leader of the world.<br /><br />My own sense is that Kennedy aware of the place of surprise in history by no means expected his work to be taken as an argument for America's inevitable decline. However anyone who reads his book will have a strong sense of how the mighty have fallen in the past, and how their successors may fall in the future. And this raising the question of how American can be wise so as to not fall. And here Kennedy's suggestion seems to be the very opposite of what President Bush suggests. Kennedy warns against overextending oneself, and President Bush seems ready to extend and extend in a quest to defeat the terrorists who would topple the United States.ans expected his work to be taken as an argument for America's inevitable decline.

It is the 'bible' of Communism, and for the former Soviet Union the theoretical basis justifying the regime's existence. Though China in its race for economic hegemony seems to be confounding in every way possible the teachings of this work it still I believe has status in the Chinese system. It is also important to note that in the name of the class war promulgated in this work Lenin and Stalin incarcerated and murdered millions of innocent people. It is perhaps not fair to blame Marx for this .But this work is particularly full of spite and scorn, a spirit of hatred for the ' evil capitalists' the rise of the proletariat was to bring the overthrow of.<br /><br />Looking at the dense and abstract prose of this tome one wonders how insane mankind must have  been to fall for this. But then Marx did speak and hit upon the truth of the enormous suffering involved in the industrial revolution, the tremendous inequality which was part of European economic reality, the great exploitativeness of those in power. Marxian ideas did at one time seem to give Mankind a new dream a new Utopian hope of a society founded on equality and justice. The terrible irony that the society which came to right injustice, did in do so become even more evil and cruel is not unprecedented in human history. One only has to look at the bloody path of the French Revolution to see that the great Soviet experiment was not without precedent.<br /><br />Now it seems to me that despite the somewhat comic persistence of certain Western academic intellectuals in finding Marx the key to the Revolution they dream of , Marx and Kapital have been consigned to the dustheap of history. Mankind has moved on to a host of other kinds of problems Marx had no inkling of, including problems related to the environment, to nuclear proliferation, to Islamic radical fundamentalism, to the biotechnical revolution threatening to perhaps fundamentally alter human nature.<br /><br />So this work which many acquaintances of mine from the former Soviet Union who were forced to study it say may be among the most hated in the world will in time become the possesion and center of interest of scholars only.ter human nature.  <br />So this work which many acquaintances of mine from the former Soviet Union who were forced to study it say may be among the most hated in the world will in time become the possesion and center of interest of scholars only.  <br />  <br />	2005-01-23

He discusses the structural differences and variants of both sonnet forms. I will just include one paragraph of his book because it seems to to say a lot about the sonnet in a very condensed form.<br /><br />\\" I have said little about the function of the sonnet, because even its slight form is capable of too much to be discussed adequately here. Its range is indeed very wide: from satire like that of Brooke, or Hood's more wistful and brilliant ' Sonnet to Vauxhall' through Shakespeare's wit and invective or Leigh hunt's grotesqueries to Milton's sublime scorn; from the wary tenderness of Wyatt to the intelligence and passion of Elizabeth Barret Browning, from Auden's potted literary biographies to Wordsworth's ecclesiastical history. Minutiae in Clare, generalities in Harley Coleridge, symbolism in Yeats, devotion and piety, doubt and effusion, political tributes, dedications, diary entries: the uses of the sonnet are not easily limitable.\\" p. 37<br /><br />For me as I believe for most people the sonnet is above all Shakespeare. And after that Wordsworth and Milton. The great star of Petrarch has never particularly shone for me perhaps because I do not know Italian. I would also mention Hopkins who I believe the greatest English practiconeer in the form from the nineteenth century to today.<br /><br />This work is a useful guide, but the real guide and the real delight is reading the great sonnets.	2005-01-23

He has succeeded in writing works that reach a very broad public, and touching many who know very little about their own Judaism. In this encyclopediac work he chooses around three- hundred and fifty subjects in various areas of Judaism such as the Jewish Bible, t Jewish history, the Holocaust, the History of Zionism and Israel, the Jewish calendar, the Jewish life cycle and writes a short essay on each subject. He is a very clear writer who is capable of using examples from everyday life to forcefully make his points. The work is intended to provide ' literacy' that is basic knowledge about Judaism and it does so on a very broad range of subjects. I believe there is no other writer on Judaism today except Rabbi Louis Jacobs who provides this kind of encyclopediac knowledge in such an insightful way. If you are someone just getting interested in Judaism this is a very good book for you. And if you are someone who knows ' something ' and wants to know even more this work is also recommended. As someone who has studied Judaism for years I find that reading such a work not only refreshes my knowledge but fills gaps that I have. So this is a good book also for the more learned especially when traditional Jewish learning often means to repeat and go over and learn again that which one has learned before.	2005-01-23

There is an emphasis on pop celebrity and the quick fix of simply pointing out that this or that person is ' half- Jewish' . There is too a total focus on what the individual can get from having a Jewish identity , and not how they are to relate to the Jewish community or world as a whole. It is a narcissitic- trip book.<br /><br />A few basic points. Judaism through the ages has considered every person born of a Jewish mother to be Jewish. This means that half- Jews born of a Jewish father and non- Jewish mother have not traditionally been considered Jewish .Some years ago the Reform movement altered this ruling and said that those born of a Jewish father and non- Jewish mother are also Jewish.<br /><br />I believe that every person who wishes to take their own Jewish identity seriously has to study and learn about the Jewish tradition. I believe too that a person who really wishes to be Jewish ( In a world where one can be Jewish ' by choice') has to consider their connection to the Jewish people and Jewish history as a whole, and consider the way that they may contribute to this.<br /><br />My own personal belief is that being Jewish is a special gift and obligation given by God but confirmed or denied by the individual's own action in life.<br /><br />My own hope then is that many of those born of one Jewish parent will find meaningful ways of connecting with and contributing to the overall well- being of the Jewish people. And here I would remind that since the destruction of one third of the Jewish people by the Nazis, and with the increasing assimilation in the West the Jewish people are in demographic decline in most areas of the world. In my view the small people that has contributed more to the well- being of mankind than any other is in great need of many of the people born of one Jewish parent who have so much to give.e overall well- being of the Jewish people.

This volume contains her diary including a record of her early years in Hungry and her time in Eretz Yisrael, two chapters about her by her mother, and chapters by fellow soldiers in the British Army from the Yishuv who served with her when they were dropped behind enemy lines during the War. Hannah Senesh was the daughter of a well- known Hungarian playwright who died when she was six. She and her older brother were raised by a very caring and devoted mother . In her school where she was outstanding she suffered from Anti- Semitism. And as Nazi power grew in Europe she moved toward a deeper connection to her own Jewishness, at one point announcing that she had become a Zionist. Her diary records her decision to go to Eretz Yisrael, and her years of education there at Nahalal. It is the diary of a spirited, intelligent and idealistic person. She volunteered to serve in the British Army Unit which was to be dropped behind enemy lines in the hope of helping rescue Jews.

The greatest share of Hungarian Jews were eventually murdered by the Nazis. She entered Hungry was captured, and was placed in prison.

It does not however provide any kind of systematic interpretation of the poems. The notes are placed at the back of the book so as not to interfere with the reading of the poems.<br /><br />Of the collected poems themselves I think that there are few readers and listeners of poetry in English who would quarrel with the assessment that Thomas was one of the great poets of the twentieth century , and arguably its greatest reader of poetry. His greatness as a poet has much to do with the sheer music and lyrical depth of his poetry , a soundrich beauty which often could be overwhelming. His great inventiveness linguistically and his strong sense of how to build a poem dramatically make his poetry riveting and mysterious at once. Along with Hopkins and Wallace Stevens his work seems to me the most hear-able of all English poetry in the past one hundred years.<br /><br />I will give one small example of how the notes help us read the poems. The notes in discussing one of Thomas' greatest poems ' Do not go gentle into that good night' describe Thomas father as an atheist who when it rained raged and blasted and blamed God for it. He was a person of integrity and strength , clearly a man of powerful feeling. Thomas great and moving lines the last stanza (' And you, my father, there on the sad height./ Curse, bless , me now with your fierce tears. I pray. / Do not gentle into that good night./ Rage, rage against the dying of the light.) are better understood when we have this sense of how his father seem to inspire him to great poetry.	2005-01-22

He is fast and quick and he covers the ninety- nine novels he selects with his usual, intelligence and verve. But the work as another Amazon reviewer pointed out lacks depth and conviction. This is the kind of work read for a brilliant remark here or a laugh there, but not for any kind of great understanding of the works involved.

His career path seems much more ' foxlike' and scattered than does the hedgehog - like career in Joyce which seems to go increasingly toward the realization of one great system in literature. In this study of the work of Joyce he tells the life- story but concentrates more on introducing the common reader to Joyce's two large tomes, Ulysses and Finnegan's Wake. He writes with skill and sympathy and even the seasoned Joyce reader can learn much from his work. It is a valuable contribution to the vast Joycean scholarship which continues to grow and grow with the years.	2005-01-21

I know the most well- known and highly esteemed is ' The Clockwork Orange' But because of the violence and language I could not really get into it. This novel Enderby on the other hand I found to be rich in incident, and language, amusing and at times funny. Burgess has irony and humor and intelligence and all these are felt in the bumbling poet's meeting with a fast - changing world of the sixties.<br /><br />I do not find any of Burgess fiction to be great, or even to move deeply. He is to my mind more in the tradition of Pope and Dryden however remote that may seem in  his great intelligence, knowledge, satirical and ironic humor. He is a very very good writer, but as I understand it he is not like his heroes, Shakespeare, Joyce, Lawrence and even Hemingway, a great one.	2005-01-21

His  success, fame and reputation however came largely through the writing career he began only when diagnosed with a condition which told him he only had a year to live. In that year in order to provide his first wife with some kind of financial security he wrote five novels. He also was cured of the tumor and went on to become one of the most prolific, energetic, and linguistically inventive novelists and critics of the latter half of the twentieth century. In this second part of his biography he tells the story of his writing life and career, of his second marriage, of the birth of his son , of the innumerable travels, meetings and connections which he makes in the course of his extremely productive life. The book is written with his usual verve and linguistic inventiveness. It is an interesting and even breathtaking at first but it eventually wore me down with its multiplication of meetings and deals and new characters and events. In truth I was looking for something deeper and more reflective, something which would too give a more insightful look into Burgess' sense of his own art. With all this I would say it provides a great deal of information and incident about one of the most inventive writers linguistically of the latter half of the century.<br /><br />It is certainly worth a read.	2005-01-21

It is a virtual dictionary of possible disaster. Rees an astronomer of great distinction considers each possibility with great care for the evidence that has been presented. His list of possible disasters makes this present work seem very tame indeed. Diamond's presentation here of the threat of ' enviromental irresponsibility' takes societies far from the center of things and shows how environmental causes, how failing to accurately read the danger led to their collapse. His marshalling of evidence is impressive and the case- histories are convincing especially to one like myself who knows next to nothing about the societies in question. Yet as a warning for Mankind as a whole it seems to me that in the age of global terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and the radical fundamentalist Islamic crusade he may be very mistaken in urging that the US turn inward focusing primarily on environmental issues. Collapse may come as Diamond rightly points out from a misreading of the basic threat and danger. It seems to me that those dangers in immediate terms today are primarily in the political and military sphere and that however real environmental problems are they are not the first threat.	2005-01-21

Why are the little lyrics of this great lyric artist so minor, and however their charm and music, of minor significance? Is it because Joyce has much greater lyrical works, with it being possible to argue that Finnegans Wake is one long poem alone? Or is it because the minor perceptions and feelings here do not strike us to the depth of the soul as the lyrics of Dickinson or Blake do?<br /><br />As words of a great genius these small poems are valuable.

It also contains selections from his other books, notes and letters.<br /><br />In his introduction Kaufmann surveys the life and work of Nietzsche and makes an effort to place him historically. For Kaufmann Nietzsche is the spiritual father of much of modern analytic and existensial philosophy. He is one of the first thinkers to as Kaufmann sees it bring about the seperation of religious faith from philosphy. He is the thinker whose work was distorted by his sister and misused by the Nazis. For Kaufman Nietzsche is  a fundamentally apolitical figure whose fundamental emphasis is on the development of the individual. And the heros of Nietzsche according to Kaufmann are great figures of mind and passion. Thus Kaufmann perhaps not completely successfully seeks to whitewash Nietzsche of negative effects of the ' superman' concept and of the ' beyond good and evil' celebration of a morality which conceivably could be taken, and was, to justify the most evil and cruel of human actions.<br /><br />Nietzsche is one of the most brilliant of all philosophical writers, and the epigramatic aphoristical and paradoxical character of his writing makes it often seem more a form of poetry than of philosophy. Kaufmann traces the stylistic stages of his development from the essay form of 'The Birth of Tragedy'to the aphoristic form of 'Human, All-too Human and then on to the rhapsody, satire and epigram of Zarathustra, and the brilliant sarcasm of ' The Wagner Case'. He compiled notes for 'The Will to Power' which he never wrote, and on the same day in hislatter years finished ' The Antichrist' on what Kaufmann calls a 'high pitched note of rhetoric ' and wrote in relative calm the preface for ' The Twilight of Idols.'<br /><br />Reading Neitzsche is at once a startling, surprising exciting disturbing and in some way confusing and confounding experience. He is often so brilliant and so unexpected that one wonders how he could possibly have written what he has. At the same time is thought is often contemptible and insulting as in his aphorisms on women. The great underlying themes of Nietzche, eternal recurrence, the going beyond good and evil, the coming of the Superman, the supposed death of God, the revaluation of values all it seems to me are problematic and in some cases wrong. This is perhaps only my way of seeing it, but I value Nietzsche more as brilliant literary artist than I do as thinker. My own judgment is that Nietzsche's extreme condemnation of Christian values, his concern for an elite few and contempt for the many are completely wrongheaded.<br /><br />Thus the pleasure I take in reading Nietzsche even under Kaufmann's expert guidance is a guilty and difficult one. His literary greatness is unassailable and there is much to be said in favor of his humane attitudes and courage ( especially in regard to his break with Wagner) but the ideas at the heart of his thought are not those with which a kind and wise, a loving and good, a creative and caring Mankind can live with.and in some way confusing and confounding experience.

Its language changes and develops in the course of the telling with the age of the hero and with the situations in which he finds himself. The development in language , the stylistic development externally marks out the internal development of the artist. Through exile, silence and cunning Joyce forged this work a bildungsroman story of his own artistic and spiritual development. It is the story of his rejection of family, of religion, of homeland to find himself in his one true home the vocation of writing of creation in literature in art. There is much memorable brilliance in the work many moving movements the child with the broken glasses before the cruel schoolmaster or the too proud young man denying his mother's religious last wish. All of this tells the story of the artificer Daedalaus and how he will move toward the making of a world of his own in literature.<br /><br />This book is often difficult to read ( Consider the lower world scene) is complicated in its style but it announces a new and private revelation the great artist's discovery and invention of his own vocation.<br /><br />Along with Dubliners and in a sense Ulysses, one of Joyce's readable masterpieces.	2005-01-20

In this they often seem to be mechanical stock characters and not flesh- and - blood living human beings. In 'The Misanthrope' Alceste believes he must tell the truth to everyone he sees. This is despite the advice of his best friend Philinte. Alceste alienates everyone. At the same time he is madly in love with with Celimene. He wants her to go away with him to retreat from hypocritical society. She however flirtatious and light - minded prefers society to him. The play closes with Philinte trying to persuade Alceste not to leave society completely.<br /><br />In the second play in this volume the leading character is a religious hypocrite. He finds his way into the heart and mind of a wealthy gentleman Orgon and dominates his family life. Tartuffe steals his money , leads Orgon to disinherit his son and offer his daughter to Tartuffe in marriage. Tartuffe  attempts to seduce Orgon's wife. Orgon is convinced to hide under a table where he overhears Tartuffe's entreaties. Orgon then decides to eject him from the family but cannot. It is only with the intercession of the king that the religious hypocrite is stopped. This play raised a furor in its day and the Church opposed its production. Moliere's patron Louis XIV allowed its production in private but only after five years allowed its public staging.<br /><br />In both these plays Moliere viciously satires the human propensity to remain fixed and static in one's own character, and reaction to reality. He derides human folly but always with the redeeming grace of laughter.<br /><br />For the contemporary reader of the work who does not feel the special force of the work in its original language there often may seem something forced and artificial in the work. Moliere's work it seems to me gain much from being staged and to know them truly reading alone is not enough.	2005-01-20

In his play 'Exiles' which is a kind of love triangle drama built around Joyce's imaginings of a wife's betrayal of her husband the drama does not come to life.

And his plays are a scathing and humorous depiction of a simplified, and stylized human nature. Whether it is religious hypocrisy in ' Tartuffe' , miserliness in 'The Miser' or misanthropy in ' The Misantrhope' Moliere often focuses on one quality in order to satirize and society and mankind in general. In the Misanthrope the main character Alceste tells the truth to everyone ( except himself) and in so doing alienates everyone. This is against the advice of his best friend Philinte. At the same time he is in love with the frivolous Celimene who he attempts to change by constantly criticizing. He begs that she retire with him away from the corruption of society but she prefers society to him. The play ends with Philinte and his fiancee trying to persuade Alceste to remain.<br /><br />Moliere writes in a clear, simple direct language and the surface sense of his work is readily understood. His view of human nature is harsh and critical , but redeemed by a comic laughter suggesting we are wiser if we do not take ourselves all that seriously.	2005-01-20

The text is broken up into a large number of chapters each one given a title .<br /><br />Here is a very small example of how the commentary is made. In regard to the central question of why Ruth refused to leave her mother - in- law after her husband's death, he writes. \\"With all the grace, compassion and heroism radiating from these verses and illuminating Ruth's personality, we still ask in astonishment , \\"Why did she see fit to act in this way!What did Ruth discover in Naomi that she took it upon herself to act this way?What did Ruthdiscover in Naomi that she took it upon herself to utter this oath?  Did she want to lavish upon Naomi the love still harbored for her late husband?<br /><br />Or did some hidden voice beckon to her, speaking on behalf of the royal family destined to issue from her?<br /><br />Indeed Ruth followed her mother- in- law to the land of Judah carrying , hidden within her, the powerful urge to expiate their crime, and the hope of perpetuation of the family in the midst of Israel-that the name of the deceased husband  not become expunged, but that a house for him be built in Judah and his name established in Israel.  And to this purpose she dedicated her life.\\"<br /><br />One can learn much about the 'Book of Ruth' from study of this work.	2005-01-20

There he was freed when his master the notorious Epaphroditus was executed. He was forced to leave Rome when Domitian banished all philosophers from Rome in 90A.D. He founded a school in Epirus in Greece where he acquired a large following. His teachings connect him with the Stoic school of philosophy but he did not have the concern earlier Stoics did with logic and metaphysics. His whole teaching was a teaching about the way to live, or perhaps not live, and the way to be happy and avoid unhappiness. As a slave he had gone through and seen many horrible things, and his philosophy is more a philosophy of avoidance of pain rather than positive achievement. Essentially he teaches ' that the door is always open' if we are suffering i.e. that suicide is always there as a way out. He teaches that the human being is wise who knows how to avoid those kinds of actions which bring upon them suffering. He strongly cautions against the human being taking too much responsibility. And what he always insists upon is that the human being recognize that he really has no power over anything except his own will. And that therefore anything which happens in the world can be overcome by being dismissed as outside of one's own control. The happiness of the childless Epictetus is thus the happiness of the solitary individual and mind. In one passage of the Discourses he talks about how even something like the G-d forbid death of one's children should not upset one, or disturb one's equanimity. To me this whole line of thought sounds inhumane and inhuman. It demands of human beings more than they realistically are able to do, in terms of controlling their own feelings. Above all it cuts them off from their responsibilities in relationship to other human beings. What about kindness and caring for others? What about loving others and helping them? What about caring so much for others that we suffer when they do?<br /><br />Epictetus is a very interesting writer but the ethic he represents seems to me to be not only an ethic of escape, but an ethic which is immoral. The great teacher of the Mishneh ,Hillel taught , ' If I am not for myself, who will be, But if I am for myself alone, then what am I? This seems to me a truer ethic and the more proper teaching for living the good life.ictetus is a very interesting writer but the ethic he represents seems to me to be not only an ethic of escape, but an ethic which is immoral.

Whether this is a great accomplishment I do not know but it does it seems to me fit in with Joyce's pattern of knowing how to take the inner structure and development of his own work to and through its ultimate end no matter what the consequences. There is a logic in the development of Joyce's work from the first epiphanies on oval leaves all through Dubliners and Portrait and then the climax in Ulysses and the great final beallandendall of the Wake.

Locke is an important figure in the history of Western Philosophy. He is really the founding figure of the great empirical tradition which would go through Hume all the way up to the various analytical philosophies of the twentieth century.<br /><br />He is also a major political thinker whose importance for the great founders of America cannot be overestimated.<br /><br />Locke talks about the mind as tabula rasa as a blank slate which experience writes upon, and reflection compounds into ' complex ideas' The simple ideas come through experience. This total rejection of inherent ideas, and inherent structures of the mind is something which a lot of modern linguistic theory rejects.<br /><br />As to the way we apprehend experience immediately I think here too Locke is in some way contradicted by modern psychological theory which would speak in some sense about our structuring that experience through our own participation in perception. In other words Locke's model of perception is I believe a far too ' passive one'. I cannot however judge, as I do not know enough about the subject whether or not Lockean categories in these areas of perception, reflection and in general description of the way we experience and know the world have any force today.<br /><br />Locke's political thinking is incorporated  in the Declaration of Independence with its formulation of rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. As strong opponent of tyrannical authority  in the political world Locke's thinking made a real impact on the world. He is one of those thinkers at the foundation of modern democratic thought.<br /><br />The book is not easy reading. I can remember going back over it again and again to try and understand the difference between primary and secondary qualities- I can remember trying to understand how much of what Locke says has validity and is ' really the truth'.<br /><br />Parenthetically I think of how as a young person knowing the truth finding the truth was such a supreme value for me. And how I thus felt it so important to know whether Locke was ' right' or not. Time and experience perhaps have made me worse. And I see this work as yet one more effort to interpret and understand Reality . This is as if to say I at this age anyway seem to accept the idea that I myself will not know and find the truth in regard to everything, including the philosophy of Locke.<br /><br />Again. This is one of the major works of Western philosophy and it should be read and studied by one who cares to know the Western philosophical tradition.ng person knowing the truth finding the truth was such a supreme value for me.

Amichai is a poet whose deep connection with the life and reality of modern Israel have made him one of its most beloved poets. Abramson analyses some of the major themes techniques and forms of his work. Her chapters are titled: Biography and Autobiography, Allusion and Irony, The Father of God, Alienation and Fragmentation, The Love Poetry, Jerusalem, Not of this Time, Not of this Place- The Short Stories, The Stage Plays.<br /><br />Among her claims is that Amichai is despite his involvement in writing about the two major events of modern Jewish history, The Shoah and the Birth of Israel is not a political poet. He is a poet within the Hebraic tradition whose examination of the theme of fathers and sons, is done in relation to the problem of orthodoxy and secularism . \\" His search for faith is not for the revival of a lost or denied metaphysical sentiment , rather it is for the indication of a moral purpose within the existing world and in history. His early work is preoccupied with quarrying for himself some sense in the darkness of war and personal confusion, and learning to live within an ontological context that has rejected the centrality of God and in which traditional imperatives are no longer valid. Together with the romantic nostalgia that characterizes much of the poetry of his generation  , this constitutes his worldview.\\"<br /><br />Abramson provides true insight into Amichai but there is of course no substitute for reading this poet of the landscape of Jerusalem and the Jewish soul , in irony ,contradiction, friendship, comradeship of battle, love, loss stone and silence.	2005-01-19

Groucho is not interested in telling the reader about his inner life and self, or about the character of his relations with others. What he does do is be Groucho, and tell in his own inimitable tone a lot of stories and anecdotes which continually crack up the reader. I remember as a child watching Groucho on ' This is Your Life' and I could not understand why he was making the same joke over and over again and laughing at George Fenniman, his announcer, and stooge. That is Groucho like Don Rickles later and maybe like comedians in general did a lot of insulting of others, low, cheap humor, getting a laugh at the expense of the 'fall guy'. This was of course very much a game and part of the show but it is something which personally has always made me a bit reserved about not only Groucho but about that particular kind of humor. On all accounts Groucho was as a ' real person' quite a grouch, a pretty miserable fellow to a lot of people including his three wives, and at some point also to two of his children. But he was also filled with life and energy, tremendously quick- minded, funny as hell, zany and crazy ,  a tremendous joy to watch or hear, and at times here, even read. He left the English language a whole group of ' remarks 'or 'wisecracks ' which promise to be with us for a long time to come'Even his cruelty in word seemed to have a playfulness about it as if he were a naughty little kid knowing always just how much he could get away with. Reading his autobiography one laughs and at the same time feels a certain sadness and empty. Joke after joke, wisecrack after wisecrack leads eventually to a kind of exhaustion and wondering if there is not more than this. Groucho is funny, one of the funniest but one wonders if that is enough in life except for a great comedian.	2005-01-19

Its main thesis is that there is a causative connection between manic- depressive illness and creativity. Redfield- Jamison uses her own expertise and her rich reading to show the statistical connection between bipolar illness and creativity. A far larger portion of creative artists are bipolar than is the general population. She points out that of all the artists it is poets who are most likely to suffer from bipolar disorder, and most likely to be suicidal.<br />She provides great insight and a tremendous amount of information. She quotes a large number of poetic texts. Nonetheless the book for me was a bit disappointing. This is perhaps because I compared it to her great autobiographical book 'An Unquiet Mind'. Redfield Jamison does raise the question in the book of whether the taking of Lithium, or other drugs which moderate extreme mood swings does have a price in terms of Creativity. The longing for the exuberance of the 'highs' is something she well understands. It seems to me that in this book there is an even and measured tone, a kind of non- exciting steadiness.	2005-01-19

It tells the now legendary story of his starting out as a four - year with the Will Mastin trio. It tells of a long - climb through many obstacles to get to the top of the show- business world. It tells of his contending with prejudice and discrimination especially during his time in the Army. And it also reveals his courage in confronting this, and in standing up for his own people. It does not tell the much sadder last part of Sammy Davis Jr. 's story when he seemed to sink into drug and alcoholic addiction, and deteriorated morally as well as in health terms. It does not tell the story of the six- pack a day smoker's final cancer.<br /><br />It reveals the earlier more optimistic Sammy Davis Jr. He was usually referred to in his glory days as the greatest all- around entertainer show- business ever had. And in truth he was a terrific dancer, a quite good but not great singer, and just a remarkably energetic entertainer. He had humor about himself and about the world, about his one eye, about his being a black Jew. One interesting part of this book tells about his friendship with Jeff Chandler an actor who was Jewish and who died young. And how that influenced on Davis's own decision to convert to Judaism.<br /><br />Davis was a person who you radiated not only great energy but a great hunger to be approved of and loved. He received tremendous applause on stage but perhaps that did not fully satisfy his need. Raised without formal schooling, and always on the road he too had a restlessness about him as if he were never at home in the place he stood. There was something to my mind tremendously moving about this part of his stage identity. He needed the applause so much the urge of the spectator was to see him get the applause.<br /><br />His private life was no great picnic and included three divorces. His daughter by the actress May Britt who apparently was a very decent person and a good mother, has written a memoir about her often absent father. His friends Sinatra, Dean Martin , the Rat Pack are all with the exception of Shirley MacLaine now gone.<br /><br />In a way in his struggle to get to the top, his fighting against prejudice his 'making it' he exemplifies the American dream. But in the prejudice he suffered, and in the downfall of his latter years he also seems to exemplify an American tragedy.<br /><br />He was enormously likeable and gave millions of people pleasure with his on- stage antics.<br /><br />Thanks Sammy you truly were a star.<br /><br />This book tells in detail the story of his early and best years.

As other Amazon reviewers have pointed out Schwartz is not much attended to these days, not much read. At one time he seemed to be the great promise of American writing. The sad tale of how he lost it and died young is now a part of his legend. In these stories he shows  originality and invention. The unforgettable movie scene in ' In Dreams Begin Responsibilities' where the child watching the courtship of his parents, hearing his father propose yells out at the screen ' Don't do it. Don't do it' is funny and deeply sad at once. Schwarz's Brooklyn world was one in which family frustrations and tensions seem to put reality itself on edge. It is Schwartz after all who is really responsible for the famous ' Paranoids too have real enemies'. Whether the persecutor was himself or not , they got him young. Before this he wrote these wonderful stories which hopefully will have a larger place in the American canon in the years to come.	2005-01-19

But the transformation made here does not have the striking originality and effectiveness that Kafka's does. Roth has a formula here which he plays out to the end. And the whole premise of the work is simply not very interesting. With Roth the effort to prove and justify is strong and this often leads to some of his worse fiction. This is mediocre Roth which means its language still has a vitality greater than most.  But it does not convince and it does not move.

The great opening blow of that Jihad the evil attacks on the world- trade center towers and the murder of two- thousand Americans are the trigger for her rage. She rightly understand that there is something terribly wrong with a great part of Islam today, and that it has chosen Western culture and most especially the United States as its major enemy.<br /><br />She is also right in censoring those European appeasers who criticize the United States for doing their dirty work for them and contending with the myriad problems created by radical Islam , whether in Afghanistan, Iraq, Madrid, New York, or numerous other places around the globe.<br /><br />Her cause is just and her anger is justified but she is somewhat indiscriminate in defining her targets. A number of experts on Islam have said that perhaps twenty percent of the world's Islamic population supports the goals and aims of Jihad. This is a huge number over two- hundred million. But it also means that eight- hundred million do not apparently advocate violence against the West. When one talks about Islam one should have an awareness of the need to try and rally those forces within Islam itself which might oppose the fundamentalists. Whether this is a realistic goal I do not know . But it seems to me it should not be dismissed out of hand. It also seems to me that Fallaci makes a mistake in gratuitously insulting great masses. The better way and she often takes the better way in this book is to give specific examples of how radical Islam has led to the murder of innocents, the violent exploitation and suppression of women, outright barbarity in relation to other peoples and cultures.<br /><br />In short I think the major message of this book is right and it is presented with a great deal of emotional force. I think it should however have been qualified and refined, with a real effort made to avoid gratuitous insult and humiliation of others.<br /><br />One more point and for me a major one in Fallaci's favor. As one who once was more sympathetic to the Arab cause than to Israel her meetings with Arafat and acquaintance with Palestinian Arab society led her to move to strong support of Israel. In the game of propaganda played in the world there is no people in recent times that have used lies and slander more successfully than the Palestinian Arabs. Whether as airplane hijackers or suicide terrorists, they have been in the first rank of those advocating and practicing terror. Fallaci 's frank condemnation of their violence is for me one of the major good points of the book. It leads to another. This book is an effort to rally the democratic forces of the West to defend themselves against the assault now being made against Radical Islam. I believe that there is such a struggle going on now, and that she is right to define it this way and to urge that the free world understand this, and act in self- defense appropriately.eal effort made to avoid gratuitous insult and humiliation of others.  <br />One more point and for me a major one in Fallaci's favor.

The principle is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively , in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do, or forebear because it will be better for him to do,because it will make him happier, because , in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise or even right... The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society,is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself , his idnependence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.<br /><br />This is in a nutshell the creed of Mill's faith in ' On Liberty ' Gertrude Himmelfarb in her brilliant introduction explains how that faith developed in part out of the personal situation in which Mill found himself after years of close friendship with the - then married Harriet Taylor after her husband died, became his wife. One great controversy relates to the vast credit Mill gave her with being a full partner in every way in creating this work. The social isolation both suffered as a result of their relationship is an important element in Mill's fierce defence of the individual's right to be free of social coercion, and opinion. Another central element in the development of Mill's thought is his reaction to the Utilitarianism his father John Mill and Jeremy Bentham instilled in Mill from childhood. 'The greatest happiness for the greatest number principal' is rejected by Mill as first basis for social action. Mill in effect says that it is not society's business to be a Grand Inquisitor and bring it bread and circuses to make it happy. Happiness is not the first principle any longer in Mill's thought rather individual liberty is. The sole curb on such individual liberty is when it leads to the harming of others. This faith of Mill can be recognized today as part and parcel of the fundamental ideology of democratic societies.<br /><br />This work is thus one of the fundamental political classics which form the Western political tradition. And it is one of those works which should be part of the curriculum of any true liberal arts education. The question of the excesses of this principle and whether Mill in his thought has provided sufficient check to it by consideration of other human values is<br /><br />a very real and debatable one even today.o the Utilitarianism his father John Mill and Jeremy Bentham instilled in Mill from childhood.

All who read him come away wondering whether their heads are screwed on right or have been swimming in a washing machine and are infinitely damaged. Perelman does stuff that no one else does. Of course he should be in print, and of course read far more than he is today even though I might say I have laughed at his work sometimes without having a clue as to whether I really understand it.	2005-01-19

But if I for a moment, bracket the question of a specific Christian faith and read the book as I have read it as a kind of story of a single individual in his quest for salvation I find it deeply meaningful and moving. To go from the Slough of Despond to contend with the evils of one's own lusts and forbidden desires to seek a way out of the Hell and suffering one has been in, and find a new road in life is something people of all religious traditions can know. The obvious sincerity and great depth of faith of the Pilgrim are inspiring. And many of the obstacles he must contend with all people in one way or another know. I found this story and allegory a moving one even though I cannot say I understood it all fully.<br /><br />Is it possible that one who  is not a Christian can enjoy and learn from Pilgrim's Progress?	2005-01-18

It is a making a game of everything in life including the writing of novels. It is a spirit of play which finds in the most commonplace things surprising reversals of fortune. It is in people who are stuck in their own character and for whom character is a gesture of repetition. It is for each and every thing not being where it should be, and not being what it should be but something else and different from what we expected it to be. It is an upside down turn around world where the child wonders what its parents were about when they begot him and the parents do not know why and where the clock in their hearts was ticking so fast at that particular moment.. It is much matter confounded with more mind, and above all that kind of surprise which makes us laugh.<br /><br />As one Amazon reader wrote even Sterne's name is a kind of fitting upside down crazy  joke.	2005-01-18

The story is told with great narrative power, the characters are drawn with great sympathy and understanding. The question the moral question of the novel is how the All- American boy who does everything right , and seems to make it all work has his life turned upside down and his daughter become a political radical completely estranged from what her parents stand for. The novel is long and I could have done without the prolonged description of the glovemaking industry. Its good to know that a twentieth century novelist can write a nineteenth century novel, but it does not seem to me of vital necessity. All these writers filling their books with factual descriptions of some particular industry seem to be imitating Melville's whale industry stuff, and seeking a kind of grand status as chroniclers of the whole society .Balzac in Bayonne, and Tolstoy in Teaneck are just not necessary. So I found the whole thing a bit long but there was much compensation. I will point to what for me is the best part of the novel and it seems to me one of the funniest and best pieces of American writing I know. Roth's description of his high- school reunion was for me  the most poignant and funny part of this work. And here I would just say that despite all my reservations about so many different sides of Roth, political religious etc. I still find him to be the funniest writer I have ever read and as his best unbeatable. This work contains some of that Roth very best stuff, and I could not more highly recommend it.	2005-01-18

It has called by many the most perfectly done example of the form. Flaubert is considered to be the most painstaking and conscienscious of artists whose search for the right word, the mot juste is legendary. And many have said that Madame Bovary is such a perfectly constructed work that not a single paragraph or even a line can be removed.<br /><br />The novel is too praised for its precision in description and its symbolic evocation of deeper levels of meaning. The scene- construction is considered superb.<br /><br />The story of adultery and misplaced passion is one which has echoes in other great works, the Scarlet Letter, Anna Karenina and it too has some of the tragic quality of those works. Madame Bovary who Flaubert later said ' c'est moi' about is the provincial woman bored to death by her staid conventional husband and longing in part like Don Quixote through her romantic reading for some great passion. The story of her seduction and of her losing herself to that passion is set against the conventional boundaries of the society in which she lives. The description of how that passion turns into a weariness, and how she becomes for her lover simply another cast- off conquest is in some sense a morality fable about the human heart's inability to realize itself fully in loving and intimate relationship. This side of it I believe reveals a certain kind of limitation in Flaubert, in his understanding of life and love.<br /><br />The novel has always struck me in its cool, ironic tone as being like the characters themselves fundamentally cruel and selfish. There are books we love I think of 'War and Peace' and ' Don Quixote' and even many far lesser works because we love their main characters , and somehow take hope in them. The unsympathetic nature of Emma Bovary and in fact of all the main characters have always meant for me that despite all the critics praise and all the talk of formal brilliance this work does not have a deep or great place in my heart. There is that is a certain cognitive dissonance between the knowledge of what this book is critically , and to so many readers and what it is to me. If I cannot love the characters I cannot love the book fully however brilliant it be.have a deep or great place in my heart.

I do have a sense of its great depth and beauty. Whitehead seems to me not only a profound thinker but a humble person who stands in certain awe before the Universe. He opens by describing the way a few people in a small part of Europe caused a great revolution in human thinking. He argues that this Scientific Revolution will amount to the triumph of Reason in the world. His chapters are on, The Origins of Modern Science, Mathematics as Element in the History of Thought, The Century ofGenius, The Eighteenth Century, The Romantic Reaction, The Nineteenth Century, Relativity, The Quantum Theory ,Science and Philosophy, Abstraction, God, Religion and Science, Requisites for Social Progress.<br /><br />I was moved by the concluding words of his book .<br /><br />\\" I have endeavoured in these lectures to give a record of a great adventure in the region of thought. It was shared in by all the races of Western Europe .It developed with the slowness of a mass movement. Half a century is its unit of time. The tale is the epic of an episode in the manifestation of reason. It tells how a particular direction of reason emerges in a race by the long preparation of antecedent epochs, how after its birth its subject- matter gradually unfolds itself, howit attains its triumphs, how its influence moulds the very springs of action of mankind ,and finally how at its moment of supreme success its limitations disclose themselves and call for a renewed exercise of the creative imagination. The moral of the tale is the power of reason ,its decisive influence on the life of humanity. The great conquerors from Caesar to Napoleon, influenced profoundly the lives of subsequent generations. But the total effect of this influence shrinks to insignificance, if compared to the entire transformation of human habits and human mentality produced by the long line of men of thought from Thales to the present day, men individually powerless, but ultimately the rulers of the world. p. 186ividually powerless, but ultimately the rulers of the world. p. 186	2005-01-18

I read the book many years ago , and it is confused in my mind with the movie based on it. As a young person I wondered how one became a hero, and wondered whether I would ever have the kind of courage that Audie Murphy displayed time and time again in the war. Now my own Army days are long gone and I have not ever been tested, and the question of what I might have been remains academic and now irrelevant. Murphy has courage which means the ability to put oneself in danger and take those actions which remove danger from one's own people, and in the process do injury to the enemy. His boyhood training in hunting no doubt helped him develop the instincts of a soldier . The reviewers on Amazon tell how movingly Murphy writes about his fellow soldiers, and their loss in battle. After the Second World War researches about combat came to center on the idea that what mattered in motivation in war was the small unit, one's nearby fellow soldiers. The loyalty to those nearby was more important than the grand ideal. It is also said that Murphy had luck , and that goes without saying. To survive a war one must not be in the place where the grenade explodes or the bullet hits. And one can never have absolute control on that. But Murphy it is also clear also made his luck . He was a true soldier with real instincts of the right action to take. No doubt part of this was his readiness to kill. He apparently was with all the glory heaped upon him a modest person, deeply traumatized afterwards by all he had gone through. One reviewer reports that Murphy died in a small plane crash when he was only forty- six. What is important is that he was a true hero, a man who fought for his country risked himself time and time again, and played a decisive role in the combat he was involved in. Every country and maybe every war needs its heroes. Sergeant York in the first world war, and Audie Murphy ( among others)in the Second.<br />And here I would add one point. A nation has its freedom and Jefferson understood this only because there are Audie Murphys, those who will fight for it. The least that can be done for them is that they be recognized( as many are not) and given some kind of thanks( though they may resist this) I think now of my own dear uncle Larry Leo Zeibert of Troy, New York who was an Army Ranger and in the first landing boat in General MacArthur's invasion of the Phillipines in the battle of Leyte Gulf. My uncle fought in the jungles of New Guineau. When he came home he said to never ask him about the war, and he never talked about it. I do not want to think about the things this quiet good man saw and did . He too went through this world in a humble, backseat way and never really built anything for himself. He had a joke and a story and a way of making everyone laugh all the time. And how deeply sad and broken he was inside only God knows. May his memory like Audie Murphy's too, be for a blessing.And here I would add one point.

This is the magical stuff that tones the bones and lightens the brains, and makes a fifty year old feel twenty one again'. Unfortunately the formula for Ponce de Leon vasser was lost in Florida in 1519 and no one not even the makers of Coca Cola have figured out how to produce this magical substance. Now it may be that the stem- cell researchers and the various gene- finders and manipulators will in a few decades find a way to keep us a constant twenty in body and forty in mind- but that is not immediately on the horizon.<br /><br />So Dr.Lodge and his patient Chris Crowley have cooked up a way for us to, ( if we cannot reverse the process entirely)make us feel a bit younger as we get older. Their regimen sounds good. Exercise six- days a week in the special ways they recommend, eating for nutrition and not in gluttony as compensation for frustration, being connected with other people in a meaningful way( A lot of this is easier said than done for many.But that's another matter) Having some passionate interest because with the mind too if we don't use it we lose it. This book gives largely sound advice for improving our lives as we are aging. I would just make one caveat.<br /><br />I have been in the world a bit too long to readily accept facile prescriptions . I have seen too many as it were healthy people suddenly hit by severe illness. We all know tragic stories of how this happens to very young people too. So while I think the advice and regimen given here is largely sound I would add that we all should be also praying for God's help. Because God's help needed at all ages of life is especially needed in old age. And at this I think of the the Jewish prayer \\" Do not cast me out in my old age\\" Much depends on us, and this book tells us a lot of what that is , but much also depends on help from Above.	2005-01-17

At some point the most successful diet is abandoned, and one goes back to the old ways. Recently there have been a number of reports saying that around ninety- five  percent of dieters are recidivists higher than prison inmates. This means that while many will lose weight with the South Beach diet( As they did with the Pritikin diet and the Atkins diet etc etc) almost all of them will be very far in mind and body from the South Beach diet a year from now. This is not a criticism of the diet itself but of the habit of many people of believing that some ' new idea' is going to provide a miraculous solution for a problem endemic to their lives.<br /><br />I have a different suggestion.The suggestion is to adopt the common sense diet. The common sense diet is one in which one can eat all categories of foods but nothing in great quantities.And to combine this with  exercise. A mild regimen suited for the person and approved by their doctor. It is also recommended to make a small list of  high- calorie foods,one is specially prone to. And to simply vow that once and forever one will never eat them again.<br /><br />Eating in a moderate balanced way, combined with exercising in a way appropriate to one's age and health are a better regimen than any of the miraculous diets which take the tons off as preliminary to putting more tons on later.<br /><br />I know this recommendation if followed would put a very profitable wing of the book- business out of business.

In doing so he also writes sympathetically about Jesus who he sees in some way as part of the spiritual history of Israel. For Buber the Jews faith is communal and centers on their persistence in history in continuing their communal religious life. He sees Christianity as having a different kind of faith one which focuses on individuals, and the individual salvation. In his concluding chapter he suggests that in the future each might take a bit more of the character of the other( not in doctrine) but in the Jewish faith becoming more pistis and the Christians moving more toward a communal faith. In the introduction to the work Buber thanks great Christian scholars with whom he was in dialogue, Rudolf Bultmann, Schweitzer, and Rudolf Otto. Clearly he was living and working toward Jewish- Christian dialogue as extension of his belief in the importance of meeting and making relationships with others in which the full humanity of both parties could be lived and expressed.	2005-01-17

He believed in the Marines and he believed that it was right to fight for the right and he  believed in the United States of America. And this belief enabled him to write a story which is one of the best books written about World War II . For me this book is confused in my mind with the movie based upon it. That movie was in some ways very important to me as a young person because it seemed to tell me the way I should try to be. To be tough and to know how to fight, and to be able to meet in life the twin challenges of manhood, fighting in war, and getting the girl. The story told by Mac the tough sergeant about Marine training and then the going into combat, and also the personal relations of the main characters Danny Forester, the All- American boy, Andy the Swede, and of course Highpockets Huxley ( played by Van Heflin) was absolutely convincing. The story of Danny Forester and the girl back home (Mona Freeman) and the one who almost stole him (Dorothy Malone) was all then quite confusing to my adolescent mind. Also the story of Andy the Swede's desertion and then coming back to join the unit. And of course the great training marches( I'm just like a prairie flower honey honey I'm just like a prairie flower babe babe, I'm just like a prairie flower growing wilder by the hour/ Honey oh baby mine/ Go to your left your right your left Go to your left your right your left/) and the pictures of combat at Tarawa and then after the R&R in Australia at Saipan Bay. The story seemed to me then what adult life was really about. And it seems to me the work still today over fifty years after it was written still holds the reader, and still has something to say about courage, loyalty, friendship and love. And also patriotism. A highly recommended work by a truly outstanding storyteller.	2005-01-17

They found that the common sense notion of a people divided into two completely opposite and opposed camps was mistaken. Between religiousness and secularity there was  a continuum . The report found that Israeli society had a very large group of traditional people who did not wholly follow Halachic religious recommendations but who practiced many of the customs of Judaism. In this book of responses to the Guttman report Charles S.Leibman analyzes the report and books it in global perspective. The conclusion is that the degree of religious traditionalism in Israel is unusual for industrial countries. Leibman and Katz try to explain this in terms of the special situation of Israel most of all the security situation.<br /><br />This is a must read for all students of Israeli society.	2005-01-17

As you are aware, I have ventured into writing;but I think that what I have read is far more important than what I have written. For one reads what one likes- yet one writes not one would like to write, but what one is able to write.\\" pp.98<br /><br />This is not to contradict Borges but it seems to me that his writing is what it is essentially because he is such a reader. And as others have often remarked the most remarkable reader .For he reads from so many different linguistic and literary traditions- and he reads with his own imagination, in effect rewriting and combining all he reads into what he enables us to read- his writing.<br /><br />In all this one feels that Borges so loves literature that he is making it live more by writing to us about what he reads. He is the writer perhaps more than any other for whom books are the first and primary experience. They are the world before the world is the world. Borges reads and rereads them and presents his rereadings to us.<br /><br />They often amaze us with their startling perceptions and beauty.<br /><br />This work is ostensibly about the craft of verse but is really Borges talking about various aspects of his reading, and his writing. And he talks with such wisdom and insight, such original poetry that it is impossible not to take pleasure in this work.<br /><br />Borges writes of the music of poetry and of the meaning of metaphor and how real literature like Louis Armstrong's 'jazz' must be sensed and felt as its first definition. For people who love poetry and people who love books there is no other writer who more strengthens their faith in what they are doing, than this very great writer and reader, this supreme lover of literature.	2005-01-16

He is a person of great learning and a very deep awareness of the Jewish tradition. He here sets out what might be called his philosophy of halakha . Within itself it makes sense and its clear direction is that we ' should live by them' and that rulings made today should be to enhance Jewish life. I will not say here anything about certain of these rulings which may seem to Orthodox Jews to be without validity. I will simply point out that the major problem for Rabbi Golinkin is that while he knows the Halachah, teaches the Halachah, is devoted to living the Halachah the same cannot be said by the overwhelming majority of Conservative Jews. In this sense he is an anomaly in the movement he is one of the leaders of. And it is fair to say that most Conservative Jews live their lives without consulting any ' rav' or  ' teacher of Halachah'. This does not mean that Rabbi Golinkin's effort is an empty intellectual exercise, rather it suggests that for reasons not dependent on him it is very limited effectiveness.	2005-01-16

His long established greatness and unquestioned place in the pantheon of man's great literary creators is not something I question or doubt. I understand that he is the major writer of the Christian Middle Ages, and for many along with Shakespeare at the very pinnacle of the world's literary creators.  My own difficulty with Dante may in part relate to the fact that he is presenting a Christian vision of life on earth, hell, purgatory and heaven. And that this vision is something I as a Jew have difficulty giving full emotional sympathy to. But there is another difficulty which I found in reading even the most colorful portrayals of those suffering in the Inferno. I found it all to be cruel. And I was repelled by the idea that God would so delight in the tremendous sufferings inflicted on sinners, who are after all too God's creatures. In other words the whole emotional landscape of Dante's lower world, and the great imaginative effort made to portray various strange and unusual sufferings repelled me. I found it in so many way petty and wrong and outside my sense of what God who made all creatures great and small , would condone. Could God who is Good really take delight in all these unending torments? I prefer to think of God as One who rather would seek a way to help save others even those who have sinned, rather than condemn them.<br />Thus the very premise of this great work seems to put it outside my own particular grasp or emotional comprehension.<br />Moreover as Dante moved to Purgatory and then later to Paradise I found myself somehow sleeping and not interested. These ' spiritual landscapes ' were too outside my own sense as a Jew of what the world is truly about . Of course God wants our penitence but there does not have to be some special realm in order for God to get it.We can repent and change everyday where we are in our own life.<br />I realize that what I am providing the review reader here is a very poor review indeed.

I remember reading this work with a mixture of amazement and bafflement, with a sense that something truly significant was being said without my being sure that I got it. The literary critic McLuhan as cultural critic was making all kinds of connections, and using all kinds of sources I knew nothing about. The whole business of the era of print, being the era of the eye of the spectator and passive audience, and the previous era being one of the ear did really go down well with me. The implication that the activity I most loved, reading. was in some sense about to be put in a lesser place by the new electronic communication did not please me at all. For as I understood it,and in a way still understand it ' reading' is the activity which really requires creative participation if it is to be done right, and the ' electronic watching television' requires much , much less.<br /><br />But despite my objection I understood that McLuhan was saying startling new( for me anyway) things in a brilliant way. He was connecting fields of endeavor exhibiting a kind of thinking, I could only admire. I might not understand the epigrammatic flashes he scatters throughout the work but I had a sense of them being deep and profound. In another sense it was clear to me McLuhan was the cultural critic who himself is a remarkable kind of creator.<br /><br />Now it is over forty years since this book was published and we live in an Internet era in which the degree of participation of individuals in producing material for a wider public is far greater than before. This small review is evidence of that for it can conceivably reach any of millions of Amazon readers. In the past I could write such a review for myself and put it in the drawer. Or try to get it into a magazine where it might be read by a few hundred or maximum a few thousand before being forgotten about.<br /><br />Yet just as it is possible to have great reservations about what has and what is going to happen to the overall intellectual development of Mankind( thanks to the Internet) so it is possible to have reservations for the electronic age global community which produces hate- literature and pornography in vast quantities ( not to speak of millions and millions of mediocre pages which no one should be asked to read )<br /><br />This book does not as I understand it hold the key to the Age we live in, or to the human future.

Israel is a vibrant democracy with perhaps even more criticism of the government made by its citizens than the United States. The idea that anyone who criticizes Israel is called by Israelis Anti- Semitic is  completely absurd.<br />2) The Cockburn ilk claim that they are not  Anti- Semitic only anti- Israel.  Considering the exaggerated, spiteful, hateful nature of their criticism  and the fact that they totally ignore the Arab aggression to which Israel has been submitted for the past eighty years there is no doubt that the Cockburn crowds are bigoted prejudiced hate- filled human - beings. Whether they are called Anti- Semites or not is really beside the point. The point is that their blanket condemnation of Israel is wrong, and even evil.<br />I would make one more point. The gleeful chorus of those who join Cockburn in one- sided and hateful condemnation of Israel know in their hearts that this comes because for whatever reasons they do not particularly like Jews.<br />The Jewish people has had many enemies throughout our long history and we nonetheless have managed to contribute much to the well- being of mankind.<br />Let me pray that with the help of God we will continue to do so.	2005-01-16

His aim was to be a poet , a poet who was true to the facts of life and to its deepest transcendal reflection.  Bode tells the story of Thoreau seeking a way to make a living, and able to find only a vocation. And that vocation found in the two years and two months at Walden Pond gave the world a literary masterpiece and Thoreau his time of realization. Bode makes it clear that all that came before and all would come after in Thoreau's life would be anti- climax. Bode also tells the story of Thoreau's complicated relation with Emerson, and of Thoreau's learning the heart of his own doctrine from Emerson' 'Nature'. The emphasis on Nature, and on the transcendent world of the Spirit , and on a kind of life apart from the ordinary commercial business of mankind would become essential parts of Thoreau's message. And this Thoreau always closer to the facts of life than Emerson. Thoreau's two disappointed attempts at love are also seen as critical steps in re- enforcing his natural tendency to walk and dream alone. Thoreau towards the end of his life subdued a bit his radical individuality in his effort to serve the anti- slavery cause. But he is the quintessential American individualist, the man who goes his own way to see something no one else has seen before. Bode concludes his introduction with Thoreau's short poem , a summary judgment on his life' My life has been the poem I would have writ/ But I could not both live and utter it./<br /><br />It is clear despite this negative judgment that in another sense the life he did come to confront and live most deeply was the one he shaped with his words.

Yet Aristotle is in many areas at the foundation of Western thought. He is the master of all who know whose thought about the universe and the way it works dominated Western thought for close to one thousand years. In the Nicomeanan ethics named after his son who edited the work Aristotle sets out his idea of what the good life is for the human being. For Aristotle every element of nature has its own essence that defines what its goal is . This is also true for the human being whose pursuit of good is to lead to eudaimonia ' happiness'. Aristotle talks about three areas of human endeavor, the common everyday area, the political area and the contemplative. For Aristotle the highest life is the life of contemplation and the few who attain this realize the human potential to the full. In his ethics Aristotle emphasizes the 'golden mean' as the path to right action. Between two extremes for instance timidity and rashness comes the virtue of  courage. The Ethics aims to teach us what human beings are in essence and how to fully become themselves. In this realization of our own inherent nature we live in a true way.<br /><br />This short summary does of course not do justice to the Ethics, or to the many subtleties of Aristotle's ethical thought. I believe to get to those subtleties more than reading of this great work is required. Only careful study will help here.	2005-01-15

Elie Weisel talks about how Hasidic story formed his imagination and still lives within him. Each of the writers seems to have his own problems, obsessions and methods. It is almost as if they were saying ' Of course all human beings are individuals, but somehow writers are among the most individual of individuals. A good collection.<br /><br />One point though. In part because the Paris Reviews are longer, and in part I think because there is someone who asks questions about the work of the writer the Paris Review interviews about writing are richer than these.	2005-01-15

Coming across Bacon on reading I came to understand that not every book had to be chewed and digested, but that there were some to be dipped in and tasted. Bacon's epigramatic wisdom has a power , a poetic condensation. I do not know the essays as a whole , but I do have the sense of Bacon as a powerful intellect capable of providing insight into diverse areas of life. I do not however have the sense of a self , and one with humor irony charm of a kind one has with Montaigne who is a far more appealing figure.<br /><br />I also believe the sometimes contradictory, and often ' broken' character of the essays do make them at times feel as if they are collections of individual apercus rather than whole constructions.<br /><br />On the whole though this is a classic work one which I intend to look in and reread again.	2005-01-14

David Ben- Gurion is the leader who brought into realization the two thousand year old Jewish dream of returning and building a state in the land of Israel. His incredible determination and courage at the critical hour led to what seemed to be an impossible victory , a victory against all odds. His story is filled with complications and questions, and he was by no means an easy or perfect person. But he was a great leader who saw the historical hour and opportunity and led his people to where they longed to go. May God bless his memory.	2005-01-14

He was worshipped throughout Europe .Today that glory has largely faded and his place in the pantheon of literary greats is somewhat diminished. With Byron there too is the question of the sensational personal life and the heroic role he adopted for himself as revolutionary liberator in Greece's war of independence. As for the poetry I doubt that too many read ' Childe Harold ' with the kind of hunger and enthusiasm it was read in Byron's time. But Byron is an incredible lyricist and there is great poetry in his canon. ' He is a figure of great passion and power, the arch- romantic hero including the demonish mysterious side. For me the total works of Byron are not to be chewed and digested but to be skimmed and tasted. There is much beauty in them.<br /><br />'She walks in beauty like the night /  of cloudless climes and starry skies/ And all that's best of dark and bright / Meet in her aspect and her eyes: / Thu mellowed to that tender light/ Which heaven to gaudy day denies.	2005-01-14

He is unique in his deep interest in and understanding of Jewish history. In this monumental work he surveys Jewish history from 1650 to 1990. Much of his focus is on Jewish religious life, and the story of the greats of Torah through the generations. He writes with clarity and with a deep faith in Hashgachah G-d's Providential Guidance of Jewish history. His understanding of the significance of the Jewish return to the land of Israel is also profound.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who wishes to better understand aspects of Jewish history not ordinarily covered in most texts.

It is the scandalous turning-of- the-tables on Christian morality . It is the great ' realistic' reading of the way rulers attain and keep power. Its prescriptions come out of its accurate description of the way Machiavelli saw the rulers in the divided city- state Italy of his time act. Ruthlessness, cruelty putting the fear of the ruler in his subjects was one basic principle of this. Machiavelli told us that the end justifies the means and that a cruelty now might not simply save one's own skin but might prevent greater cruelty later on. All of this has had tremendous influence on Western political theory and action. One thinks of how even in the late twentieth century the political realism school of Hans Morgenthau had its roots in Machiavelli. One sees too how Neitzsche's revaluation of values, his overthrowing of Christian morality and his focusing on the will to power may be seen as having their source in Machiavelli. Nonetheless with all the desire in the world to understand that Machiavelli was only describing the reality that he saw it might make some sense to ask the question of whether his championing of a kind of immorality did not open and lead to evils he himself did not envisage. In other words once the end justifies the means, and once evil is sanctioned in no matter what the form one can move from a small city- state in Italy to a world- state which oppresses a good share of humanity. In other words it seems to me that it is necessary to ask whether the roots of the modern totalitarian terror state the state of Nazi Germany and of Stalin's Russia do not in some way stem from Machiavelli. If they do then there is a moral judgment to be made about this brilliant thinker. And there is something to be said for the idea that our prescriptions for transforming reality should not simply be based on our sense of how the worst have gained power. Here I wonder if a different kind of reading of reality, one which focused on democratic states and free peoples might lend somewhat different conclusions from those laid out in the Prince. The authors of the Federalist papers certainly had a sense of how man acts in his own self- interest, and yet they were interested in establishing a society in which there would be a maximum of freedom and justice and a minimum of tyranny. Perhaps they and the writers of the Constitution and Jefferson's Declaration of Independance constitute a different vision of how a society can be ruled.ne which focused on democratic states and free peoples might lend somewhat different conclusions from those laid out in the Prince.

She is a writer who chronicles the small motions of the heart in expectation and disappointment. She writes usually with a kind of fine irony and her characters rarely escape untouched by careful criticism. In this novel still thought to be her best Edith Hope the protagonist a romance- writer who has walked out of her own wedding and is carrying on a passionate( from her side) affair with a married man escapes to a Swiss vacation resort. There she encounters other lives caught in the desperations of love, and there too she comes to meet the one who will be something like her rescuer, the decent Neville who she will commit herself to a loveless marriage too. With Brookner the heart of the story is not in the major movements of the plot but with the line- by- line perceptions which mark out an extremely intelligent observer of the heart's minor motions. Disappointment and learning to live with a life far less than one has hoped are major Brookner themes. She gives the reader that consolation of knowing that a certain kind of quiet suffering is not theirs alone.<br /><br />I myself have found that reading a few Brookner novels has been enough, but I know one faithful reader of Brookner who continues to see her as the best diagnostician of the ailing human heart writing novels today.	2005-01-13

The author captures the spirit of a certain time in America. She writes with sympathy and great verve about the characters including Seabiscuit. Her description of the race- scenes is the best I have ever seen. The book grips you and holds you. And the book too has a kind of grit and integrity, the same kind the major players show. It is the determination and guts of the underdog the one who fights back, the one who meets a thousand adversities and does not give up. The tragic element of the book is of course in the real ending of what happens to Red Pollard. And in the fact that even the greatest moment of victory cannot be sustained and that life has to go on in many ways.<br />I do know a bit about horse-racing as I worked in Saratoga in my teenage years. But I do not know that much. This book opened the world of horseracing to me and made it more appealing than I had imagined it could be.<br />Its just a great read and I recommend it very very highly.<br />There was Man of War and there came Native Dancer and Nashua but there was only one Seabiscuit	2005-01-13

The story of a spiritual quest in which the young privileged hero goes out to the world , and tries to meet and know every different kind of experience. He goes through different stages of life , including one in which he tastes the sensual pleasures of life to the full. He meets old age, sickness and death. He comes to a kind of humble understanding of the nature of life and his spiritual quest is one in which he comes to a kind of peace.<br /><br />The story is told with simplicity and skill, and it flows wonderfully.<br /><br />My own problem with the book is that the wretch ' concentred all in self' . There is no deeper understanding of how the ordinary connections of family and community , and the giving to them provide life with meaning and dimension beyond the self. There is too no feeling that one can by one's own effort add to the goodness of the world, make a change for the better however small.<br /><br />This is not to deny the truth of Siddartha's quest or understanding, but only to indicate that it is one road and not the only road or in my opinion the ideal road the person can take in this life.	2005-01-13

I read it all. I tried to learn about the art of novel- writing from it.<br /><br />I have just read the Amazon reviews posted about this novel. A couple are good. They tell me that Kundera writes here about Cervantes, Sterne, Balzac, Dostoevsky and Kafka. They tell me the book has a seven- part structure as his novels do. They tell me that Kundera contrasts the art of the novelist with the thought of the philosopher- and that for him the art of the novelist is in portraying ambiguity and complexity. They tell me that this particular book is one of his best.<br /><br />Now I have read other Kundera works. I know his work plays much with chance and infidelity and philosophical reflections by the characters on whether their disloyalty or love is bringing them to the incredible lightness of being which some seem bound to living in. They tell me too that the reflections touch about politics , Czech freedom, what it means to write under tyranny and what it means to live in the West.<br /><br />But the truth is I having read this work on the novel by Kundera remember not one single sentence or thought from it.<br /><br />This the impatient Amazon reader perhaps thinks says more about my own empty head than it does about the value of Kundera's work.<br /><br />But I now wonder if something in Kundera's world and way of seeing things, his kind of liberation, his kind of emphasis on the incidental and very secular do not repel this religious reader seeking to feel that all, even in the novel, should have some kind of deep and permanent connection with the One Source of all true meaning.<br /><br />It may be I have forgotten Kundera because his themes and understanding are ones I simply do not wish to know.	2005-01-13

The Heidegger - Arendt affair is immoral from the beginning because it is an adulterous relationship.<br /><br />Secondly, Herr Philosopher did use his power and position to enchant the very enchantable fledgling philosopheress.<br /><br />Thirdly, however morally distasteful the relationship before the War its renewal afterwards represents a tremendous moral failing on Arendt's part.<br /><br />Fourthly, Arendt showed in ' Eichmann in Jerusalem' a kind of contempt for her own Jewishness. Her willingness to slip over Heidegger's Nazi connection shows a moral failing at the deepest level. Heidegger is no ordinary person, and as person of stature much more , not much less, should have been expected with him. He identified with those who killed one third of Arendt's people.<br /><br />Fifthly, Jaspers Arendt's other great mentor and friend was a truly noble person. He set an example in regard to Heidegger which Arendt unfortunately was unable to follow.<br /><br />Sixthly, Arendt in this relationship from the beginning was the subordinate, the secondary, and in some way the ' slave'. The Jew subordinated to the superior Aryan Heidegger. She never overcame this, and this represents a tremendous moral stain. She was a great thinker and in some of her life actions a noble person but in this relationship she failed the moral test. Heidegger was a Nazi sympathizer. For that reason I believe he deserves his own special place in a very low circle underground.	2005-01-13

Only Orwell it seems to me in ' Animal Farm' does something far surpassing the original.<br /><br />But Aesop is a classic , and one often used as first literature for children. I have never found the morals very deep or profound or the stories the most moving in the world, but this does not change the fact that they are part of Western mankind's fundamental vocabulary in literature and story.	2005-01-13

It was spoken about with a kind of hushed reverence, and ohwow awe. My reading of it was not I am afraid very successful and I found it impossible to really understand either what was going on, or why I should care. Rumination is literature perhaps, but usually when given in shorter doses. In any case I realize that what I am saying is probably going to defend diehard Hesse fans who know the secrets of the beadgame even though as I understand it it is not fully described in the book. I also was taken aback a bit by the kind of monastic intellectual and spiritual discipline which it seems Hesse is recommending as summum bonum. Isn't there life outside the kind of elite discipline that seems to be recommended here.<br /><br />I have I must admit always been fascinated by the idea of an intellectual synthesis , a kind of ' theory of everything' or a ' unified field theory of all human disciplines' In some sense this is what is hinted at here. But I did not get how it works.<br /><br />So my review is more about my own failure to understand what to some is a major classic of world literature.

A Jewish Response to Missionaries	Books	5	160	180	N	N	Misinterpretations of Kaplan in Amazon reviews	I am dismayed at reading the misinterpretations of Aryeh Kaplan's work by Amazon reviewers.<br /><br />I would like to make a few simple points in the hope of not insulting anyone.<br /><br />The first is that the Jewish people today constitutes less than two tenths of one percent of mankind. Christians constitute one third of mankind, two billion people.<br /><br />Historically millions of Jews have been persecuted and killed by Christians.<br /><br />Jews do not make any kind of effort to convert Christians to Judaism. To become Jewish requires a long learning process and cannot be done overnight. Converts are initially discouraged , and are accepted only when they show great persistence.<br /><br />On the other hand Jews are continually harassed by all kinds of groups who believe that they by saving us they are saving our souls. We would prefer for G-d to save our souls, and would appreciate being freed of this undue attention.<br /><br />The Jewish people is struggling to survive in a time of heightened assimilation. It is a very small part of mankind. Therefore those who care for its continued existence should not be trying to whittle it down.<br /><br />Therefore all that Aryeh Kaplan is doing is trying to keep Jews Jewish. He is not trying to interfere with Christians and Christianity.<br /><br />Most Jews consider Christianity a sister monotheistic faith and care only to respect Christians and be respected by them.<br /><br />I would add. One group which is particularly offensive to Jews is those who call themselves ' Messianic Jews'. They are people who are born Jewish and have become Christian. Becoming Christian is their free choice and right. It is a betrayal of their Judaism and Jewishness, but they have a right to make that choice. But claiming that they are still Jewish when doing this is an absolute immoral and hypocritical action. You have joined another religion so belong to that. There is no Jewish communal body or leader Orthodox ,Conservative Reform or Reconstructionist who considers such people to any longer be Jewish.<br /><br />So the bottom line is . Please Christians respect us and allow us to live by our own faith. We respect you and believe our presence on this planet as Jews living by Jewish law in accordance with the teachings given to Moses at Sinai should not be of disturbance to you.uch people to any longer be Jewish.  <br />So the bottom line is . Please Christians respect us and allow us to live by our own faith.

It was in a sense problematic from the beginning and problematic throughout as Tolstoy himself was always problematic. The combination of tremendous lust and tremendous idealism , the demandingness of an incredible genius from himself and from others meant that life with him would be incredibly difficult. The devoted wife Sonya( nee Behrs) who helped him in the physical work of rewriting his greatest masterpieces also went through thirteen pregnancies and brought him a large and also very problematic family. This work chronicles their story by reading their diaries. It is not an easy tale, but it is an illuminating and often moving one. For their passionate contradictory and difficult souls combined and collided in many different ways. In old age it was the money, the property her desire to look after her childrens' interest and his desire to save the world which moved them finally apart. His legendary last escape to the railroad station where he died seems to say something to us all about the ' hell ' of marriage. And theirs certainly had more than its share of hell. But it also had love and greatness . This book tells the story with sympathy for both of these torn souls. It fills out details and adds to the extant literature. It may not be the last word but it is a welcome addition to the literature.	2005-01-11

It is an infantile effort to infantilize Mankind , and make us all irrational fools. Freud does not see the possibility of true religious Revelation. He does not understand that the idea of God is beyond human comprehension even his own . He does not know the limits of his own rationality. He too as some other Amazon reviewer has written does not know the dimension of religious awe, of fear and trembling.<br /><br />I would make one more very personal point. Our need for G-d is in my mind not a proof of God's non-existence but rather a proof of  God's necessity. Our love of God is not a proof of our weakness but rather a proof of our capacity to show gratitude to all the Goodness in our lives and in the world that we have been given.<br /><br />Freud came from a world and time which thought God could be rationalized away. That world is in some sense gone. But human beings of this generation and the next and all generations will always need G-d. For we are small and here now and God is beyond us all, including great geniuses like Freud.	2005-01-11

He is a researcher and a thinker who looks into social phenomena and makes connections between diverse activities and areas of life in startling and interesting ways. While he is most known for the concept of ' the tipping point' I personally found his most remarkable essay to be on key figures in human social networks, and the way one individual may  connect hundreds of even thousands different kinds of people  together. In this present work which I have read the British edition of  he writes about what he calls 'adaptive unconscious' about processes of mind and decision that determine much of our action in life. He opens with a consideration of the Getty Museum's considering the purchase of what seemed to be a great new discovery, a statue of a certain kind called a 'kourous. The Getty went to the greatest experts in scientifically evaluating the materials of the statue and they come up with it as genuine. However when the Getty showed the stature to people who live in the world of art history most of them instinctively recoiled from it. They made the kind of ' blink' split - second decision which bypassed their consciousness. They proved to be right. Gladwell goes on to consider ' thin- slicing' decision making in other areas, that is decision-making which is based on a very small set of experience. In his second chapter he looks at the work of a psychologist John Gottman who has developed a method of predicting whether a couple will eventually divorce through noting certain qualities revealed in a fifteen - minute conversation between them. Stonewalling, criticizing are two of the factors attended to but the key one is the degree of contempt one of the partners may have for another. But for Gladwell the focus is on understanding that it does not take a prolonged process of consciously investigating and collecting data but rather a quick- thin- slice evaluation to get to the truth of the situation. Gladwell investigates other kinds of situations in which in one case a firefighter, in another a Vietnam War veteran and Marine officer show a kind of instinctive ' right action' which would not be possible had they talked or thought too much at the wrong time and confused themselves in the process. Gladwell writes of very interesting characters , finds people of extraordinary abilities even when it comes to selling cars or tasting food. He centers on non- conventional figures who have in one way or another extraordinary gifts in ordinary life. In one chapter he looks at the diagnosis of heart- attacks in emergency room and shows how a method a researcher tried to push and had rejected for years has enabled quick, life- saving diagnosis. In this situation too he shows how too much information, too much conscious rehashing of data can interfere with a kind of quick- decision making a kind of ' in a blink' judgment. Here however it should be pointed out that Gladwell insists that in many areas of life it is only because there has been prior training, study, rehearsal that such wise- snap judgment is possible. All in all this is a richly informative and highly interesting work, a very pleasurable read.<br /><br />It will take more than one blink to read, but it will be worth it.f the situation.

The three- fold division into ego- id- super-ego in some sense parallels the three fold division in Plato's thought. For Freud the Id is the unconscious instinctual animal element in us. It is our ' drives our hungers our lusts, our sexual lust centrally. The ego is the social self, the construct with which we meet the world. It is our rational self, our self as we present ourselves to the world through. The superego is the conscience, the what we should be. For Freud it is the voice of others, and especially of our parents telling and teaching us the difference between right and wrong. As Freud understood these three aspects of self are in constant interaction, and the kind of personality we are is determined by which of these faculties is predominant.<br /><br />It is possible to regard this theory as insight and useful and draw conclusions from it.Or it is possible to simply put it aside as one more human construction aimed at understanding what must be understood in many different ways.<br /><br />The book is small but not easy to read. A great mind is at work making order out of the minds of all of us. Whether he succeeds for you , you alone must judge.	2005-01-11

To play with it a bit ,\\" It is not foolish always to be a fool, and on the outward shows and games of mankind make endless mockery. For who is the fool in the one place we are all to go?\\"<br /><br />I remember reading this work in graduate school. A dutiful plodder wondering why I was not laughing out loud and being so amused. Rather I was falling asleep inside and finding the dull complaints of Erasmus a kind of spiritless exercise in predictable dumping on all things.<br /><br />Alas, I am usually apologetic about not understanding works generations of mankind consider classics. But in this case I will make a modest disclaimer. This one is not in my eyes a great one, not even a very good one.<br /><br />And now to another complaint. The great tolerant Erasmus who could see the folly of human greed and vanity and prejudice everywhere was himself quite vain and greed and prejudiced in regard to one very small minority of 'Europeans' who can claim to be the most persecuted people in the history of mankind. Why should I sing the praises of someone who hates me?<br /><br />The bootsteps of Nazism march to the tune that Erasmus and Voltaire the two great ' liberators' of European mankind sing.<br /><br />I have no praise for Erasmus folly and his wickedness in this.	2005-01-11

Perhaps it was difficult for Freud in his old age and dying at the time that his own people were helpless before the Nazi murderers to see power and potency in his own people. Moses is of course a symbol of Law and Might and Justice and for the Jews direct contact with God in a way no other human being will ever have. Freud finds a way to deny Moses' Jewishness perhaps as a way of suggesting that if real salvation is to come real power to enter the world it must come through other human beings, not Jews.<br /><br />In any case I see no real evidence for Freud's fiction. The Tannakh the Hebrew Bible certainly clearly and definitely states who Moses and Aharon and Miriam's parents were. It gives their line of descent also as princes of the Tribe of Levi. To deny all this and simply invent an Egyptian prince tale seems to me the height or perhaps depth of historical responsibility. This is a last word of Freud and unfortunately far from a credible one.	2005-01-11

Erikson shows how the revolutionary Luther in conflict with his own violent father and himself turns against the world of corrupt medieval indulgence- laden Catholicism and uses his own personal energy and story to create a powerful change in history, the Reformation.<br />This is an admirable piece of theorizing and research combined and a fascinating read.	2005-01-11

He is vastly knowledgable and skilled, the master of verse and its formal modes. His neo-classic intelligence means he has polish , satirical skill, great wit and irony. He does not have what the Romantics will later bring the deep emotional soul- shaking poetry, the confessional autobiographical depth.<br /><br />This anthology contains The Rape of the lock, Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lay, Eloisa to Abelard, and the key 'Essay on Man'Also Satires and Epistels of Horace Imitated, Epilogue to the Satires, and the Dunciad.<br /><br />I'll close with a few citations from Pope lines of his which have stayed with me.<br /><br />\\"Vice is a monster of such frightful mien, that to be hated, needs but to be seen- But seen too oft, familiar with her face, we first endure, then pity, then embrace. \\"<br /><br />And \\" Hope springs eternal in the human breast. Man is forever/ to be blessed' \\"<br /><br />Pope can be for long stretches boring to the modern reader, but he also can be delightful and surprising.<br /><br />When I think of him I think of another great genius who also suffered from his very small misshapen physiognomy Kierkegaard.Both were great masters of wit, irony and satire but of course for Kierkegaard the direction was all inward towards religious depth while Pope was the supreme social satirist who knew how to get back at the snubs of the aristocratic society for whom he was toy, talent and irritant.	2005-01-11

A powerful and profound thinker he believes that he understands all. It is thesis- antithesis - synthesis and that synthesis is new thesis - antithesis - synthesis. And this logic of mind is the logic of history. And it is all coming to climax in the nineteenth century Germany  Hegel is living in.<br /><br />The method of course leads to Marx. Two dialectic dummies.<br /><br />The 'system' is of course opposed by Kierkegaard who wants real life in his philosophy and not ' system' and ' endless abstraction'.<br /><br />The world actual history with all its surprising turns and new developments simply makes a joke of the Hegelian analysis. Technical reality gives far too much to our world to take someone like Hegel who could not possibly have understood it as its leader.<br /><br />We still have the idea of development today.

He saw them as deeper messages delivered to us from our unconscious. He saw them as telling the secrets about ourselves to ourselves and the world that we do not necessarily want to tell. He saw them as acts of aggression and as acts of self- defense. In fact Freud is one of the few theorists of jokes and laughter that the world has had. In my opinion while Freud's understanding of jokes is not exhaustive and all- comprehensive it does illuminate much about a certain kind of humor. And it does teach us something about ourselves which we had not really noticed before Freud taught it to us. Freud himself is of course a source of endless jokes today , but it is not wrong to say that at least some of these jokes should be about his great genius and ability to see and say where others before him did not.	2005-01-11

Books	3	17	18	N	N	A mediocre somewhat misleading how- to -get- rich book	This book was by and large a waste of money. It is very poorly written and extremely repetitive. It makes a big deal out of repeating the idea that the way to get rich is not through going to school, studying hard, getting a good job, and working. It presents the idea that the way to wealth is somehow through leaving the job and work behind, and thinking and investing as if one were rich. It does not however tell people how to build a stake large enough to begin investing with. It does not tell you what to do if you are not born rich to begin with.<br /><br />There are principles laid down on how to act in order to become rich. It does not by the way occur to the authors that there might be some other goals in life beside wanting to be rich. They do not discuss that issue at all.<br /><br />They speak about the importance of knowing accounting, investing, of knowing how to read an income statement and balance sheet. I believe that this is a good point and it would be wise for most of us to know how to do this. They caution against the kind of high- living and excess spending which means the person is permanently in a rat - race to keep their head above water. This too makes sense. Very common sense.<br /><br />They do not in any way take into consideration the possibility that there are different kinds of characters who might need different kinds of financial paths and advice. For them everyone is someone who first and above all wants to be very rich.<br /><br />I found this book an insult to not only my intelligence but to my basic sense of what is important in life. I know the book will make its already rich co-authors more rich. I doubt if it will enrich anyone else.<br /><br />Had I known the bottom line on this book before I read it I would probably have never bought it.	2005-01-10

But I also felt that old Bellow gift for inspired insight into life, a kind of reflectiveness on the everyday which makes a poetry of ' seeing'.

Each one gives a clear insight into its subject. Kaplan has an ability to take abstract and difficult concepts and explain them in a clear way. As a person of great faith his faith resonates through the writing and inspires. The two volumes of the Aryeh Kaplan anthology contain works on a variety of Jewish subjects from Jerusalem to Tzitzit, and from writing on the Mikveh to writings on concepts related to ultimate redemption. Kaplan is one of the best expositors and defenders of traditional Judaism there is. And he writes out of a great competence in contemporary scientific and technical matters. These works can be read and reread for inspiration and strengthening of one's faith.	2005-01-10

Ruth Wisse is a tremendously sensible and solid thinker who analyzes the condition of Jewish liberalism and finds it wanting. The case she makes for Jews having the courage to stand for their own interests especially in regard to the defense of Israel rather than curry favor in the eyes of those whose favor they will not have anyway, is very strong. I think that she also understands that underlying much Jewish liberal self- criticism is a real ignorance not only of Jewish history but of present world- realities. This work should be a basic text most especially for all those Jews engaged in civil rights activities.	2005-01-10

This work is a kind of realistic look at working class or lower -middle class post-war British life. In the title story of the collection the boy selected to run deliberately loses the race in order to preserve his own independance and integrity. His gesture is the gesture of the lone individual in defiance of the suppresive system, and bears a resemblance to that of Salinger's Holden Caulfeld. The image of the long - distance runner whose task requires will and courage and ability to resist and overcome pain going on his own way and refusing the glory of public victory says much about our own inner evaluation of ourselves and our dignity. It reminds too of the liberation which Solzhenitsyn's Ivan Denisovich finds within himself despite being in prison. The loneliness of the long distance runner is the loneliness of one whose only liberation is from within.	2005-01-10

Books	5	16	24	N	N	An appeal to the American taxpayer	This book is not so much about the blatant bias which most Middle Eastern Studies Departments display in regard to the various conflicts in the Middle East. It is rather about the errors which those in those departments have been consistently guilty of. The two major ones according to Kramer relate to Islamism and Middle Eastern civil society. In the seventies and eighties these faculties were filled with people publishing articles which suggested the Middle East was about to enter a new period of 'enlightened Islam'. There was not a hint in these departments about what was to happen in the United States on Sept.11, 2001. There was no real effort to understand the process of radical Islamicization which was taking place throughout the era.<br /><br />The second major set of errors related to the character of the societies themselves. The experts were talking about a transformation to a new civil order in the Middle East. Instead what has occurred is an ever- deepening backwardness in which individual rights, the rights of women, free inquiry , democratic institutions are  given no place.<br /><br />Kramer shows how the in-built prejudice of the Middle Eastern Studies department made their batting average in seeing the future of the area, zero.<br /><br />Beyond this Kramer takes a look at the way the US government has funded programs in these departments, and given free lunches and worse to investigators who are hostile or at best indifferent to the needs of American society. The Middle Eastern studies departments have not contributed in an adequate way to the education of scholars, students of Arabic, experts who could help in the worldwide US campaign against Terror which has a good part of its base in the Arab Middle East.<br /><br />Kramer sees that the throwing of federal funds at these departments have led them to go in their own often Anti- American ways.<br /><br />What he would like to see is Middle Eastern studies departments which have some sense of responsibility to the US society which they belong. He would like to see more diversity, true diversity in the kinds of scholars which are hired, and opinions debated. He sees one key to this in the Federal funding which provides the research money for graduate students and post- doctoral studies. He is not asking for a curtailing of academic freedom but rather suggesting that there be on the part of Middle East studies faculty an awareness that they live in American society and have obligation to its norms and standards. He understands that given the entrenched faculties of most of these institutions great change will not come overnight. But he believes the United States government and its citizens should not be content with a situation where ninety percent or more of the faculties opposed the 1991 Bush invasion of Iraq , and oppose US goals for the area.<br /><br />This is a well- argued, clearly written piece of work, an overwhelming indictment of intellectual and moral corruption in the Middle East Studies departments of America.<br /><br />Congress should take note, and when the next time comes for appropriating funds for ' Middle Eastern scholars' make certain that the present situation of corruption is not allowed to persist.iety which they belong.

His self- portraits trace the story of his own life development. From the wild youth of the beginning to the aged and broken figure at the end we see in them the course of a person's life. But more than this . In certain of these portraits one thinks of the Rembrandt self- portrait in the Frick where he sits as king and master of his world of art one feels the deepest human insight and expression of genius. The story of a life is the story of a great soul even when posing and looking in another direction. Rembrandt's own tragic story has its reflection in the whole deepening shadow and distance of the central subject in time. To make the story of one's life a series of masterpieces is a unique achievement in the history of art. And no one not even Rembrandt's countryman Van Gogh will come close to equalling it. This is a great book to have because it contains the images of masterpieces made by one whose life was a succession of such great works.	2005-01-09

It is the final work of one of the great American literary adventures of this century. It is very far indeed from his greatest works ' Herzog ' and 'Seize the Day'. It at times reads as a kind of exercise built around an idea. It is clearly undisguisedly modeled on Bellow's friendship with Allan Bloom. However much of the ' larger - than-life ' posturing of the Bloom- Ravelstein character give him an unappealing quality that his great best friend perhaps misses. I so much wanted to enjoy this last Bellow as I have some of the others. But this one does not make it for me on that level. I would certainly however recommend it for all Bellow fans. And I would say also that even mediocre Bellow contains many lines and passages of stunning literary brilliance and value.	2005-01-09

I therefore will try to avoid repeating what has been said about Gold's historical analysis of Wahahabism his development of the thesis that present- day Saudi Arabia is a prime funder of terrorism worldwide, and a state which acts against the interests of its patron and as it were most essential ally , the United States. I will instead simply point to two other works which seem to affirm much of what Gold has to say, Craig Ungar's, 'House of Bush, House of Saud' where he links the Bush family to the Saudi corruption explaining how the US has not dared to really get to the sources of Saudi terror. I would also point to John Loftus work on ' The Secret War against the Jews' in which he traces the Nazi connection to what would become later a vicious Arab- anti- Semitic ideology of which Saudi Arabia( the chief distributor of the Anti- Semitic tract forged in Czarist Russia, \\" The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\" ) is a principal proponent. Gold traces the role of the Evil Kingdom in sponsoring terror worldwide. He does not however do enough to show how US interests are so bound up with Saudi oil and money that acting against them in a real way could be detrimental. The fact is that the present war on terror conducted by the Bush Administration is in some sense hostage to Saudi terror.<br /><br />This book goes a long way toward exposing the evil, racist ideology of Saudi Wahhabism. It goes a long way towards showing the negative role Saudi Arabia is playing in the war against Terror. It does not however offer a realistic way out for US policy. To cut off Saudi Arabia is to lose its oil and money. To force regime change is to risk radicalization and anti- American takeover. To go along is to go along with a corrupt regime one which educates to anti- Americanism but one which is still dealing with America.<br /><br />I don't envy US policy- makers in this situation. The fundamental line of promoting democracy in the Middle East seems a joke when it comes to backward Saudi Arabia, a country totally unprepared for such a transformation.<br /><br />Gold's book if nothing else teaches us that the free world as a whole and particularly the US have plenty to worry about in regard to Saudi Arabia. It does not teach us however how to deal with this worry.ing democracy in the Middle East seems a joke when it comes to backward Saudi Arabia, a country totally unprepared for such a transformation.  <br />Gold's book if nothing else teaches us that the free world as a whole and particularly the US have plenty to worry about in regard to Saudi Arabia.

Edel labored on the James biography for over twenty years and has great sympathy and admiration for his subject. In a sense the work has something of the quality and intelligence the character of James' writing itself. It is the story of a life devoted to art a life in which experience seemed to less exist as value in itself than as material for its artistic transformation and elaboration. One of the great moving parts of the work is the story of James' tragic failure as a playwright. And the story of his recovery from it and his going on to produce the New York edition of his works is a story of a kind of determination and courage displayed by this most dedicated of artists. As to the relationships of James to the other members of his remarkable family including the philosopher who wrote like a novelist his brother William Edel is instructive but not exhaustive. It was nonetheless touching to read how these two great figures of American intellectual life came towards the end of their days to show a brotherly caring and respect which overcame the inherent ambivalences of their somewhat rivalous relationship.<br /><br />The reader needs patience and a feeling for Jamesian abstraction and complexity. But this work will help the reader know well, if not completely, the great American novelist who wrote as if a philosopher.	2005-01-09

But the fascination with the life of the great artist, and the whole subject of creativity kept me reading on even when I felt a bit disgusted in doing so.<br /><br />I don't think it is my prudery that led to these feelings. The Picasso of this work is an egomaniac, a moral monster, who shows absolutely no consideration whatever for those closest to him. The people who have helped him in the past do not count for him. The people who are involved with him in the present are manipulated by him for his own purposes. He is tremendously ambitious, greedy financially, stingy, sexually driven and demanding without necessarily being interested in the feelings of the woman he is with . Gilot is no innocent, and her relation with Picasso comes not only one feels out of her own ambition as an artist but her desire to be next to the big- deal the big- name the great genius of art. It is instructive how she cans the two aunts who raise her when the great Pablo demands exclusive attention. This is not to deny her genuine love for him or his passion for her, though no doubt this was never particularly exclusive. Picasso was a great user, user of materials and situations for his art, and user of people for his life. His work has a cruelty his life shares. And it seems to me that that cruelty means his work in the deepest sense does not reach the highest level, the level where Rembrandt and Michangelo and Raphael are. And this because the great draughtsman is not a great reader of the human soul . He is rather a twenty- second technical man a supreme master of means who knows how to put the machine in himself to use to cut up and recombine the world for his purposes. Gilot goes too as do all the previous wives and mistresses, the agents and friends. And Pablo takes and takes to the end .<br /><br />Gilot is a tough character and in a way her presentation of herself as one who stands up to him at points gives the work a certain dramatic power. But in the end the feeling is that the greatest art cannot come of or dwell in the kind of sordidness of spirit which Picasso so often displayed. And thus the reading of this work gave me the sense that generations hence though they may admire the work of Picasso will not be inspired by and love it as we do with the work of the very greatest artists.o stands up to him at points gives the work a certain dramatic power.

But he is a writer who is always interesting and insightful. He is a person of great moral balance and judgment, and integrity.

When the present is nonexistent future and past too become blurred. The future is so immediate that one no longer waits for it.Hope turns into desire.

On one particular issue I  for many years knew of the negative role of the U.N. that is in its one-sided anti- Israel bias- and its use of UNRWA to exacerbate the Palestinian Arab refugee problem instead of working to reasonably solve it.  But this book provides a deep and thorough understanding of how the U.N. which was founded at a moment of international  ' moral clarity' has degenerated into a major source of conflict and problem on the world- scene. Gold writes of how the Allies after the Second World War thought to found an organization which would help promote world- peace. Originally the only members allowed to join were those who had contributed to the war- effort against Nazi Germany and Japan. Churchill even wanted the organization to be called ' The Allied Nations' but the name United Nations was chosen. The organization almost from the outset failed in its peace- keeping tasks both in the Arab states invasion of Israel and the India- Pakistan War.  Gold shows how this pattern of failure has persisted . And even more troublingly he shows how the U.N. has contributed to mass murder, including that of eight-hundred thousand Tutsis in Ruanda, and in the enclave of Sbrenica. UN peacekeepers insisted on their 'neutrality' and in fact sided with aggressors in these instances.<br /><br />Aside from the case studies Gold outlines the fundamental moral and ideological failings of the organization. He shows how it tends to side with aggressors, with anti- democratic regimes, with totalitarian tyrannies. He shows how the US has repeatedly been forced to bypass the UN in order to forward its own efforts at democracy. The exception to this was the first Gulf War when President Bush did forge a  UN backed coalition against Saddam. But in the Second Gulf War this option was no longer possible, and George Bush Jr. had to go it with his own limited coalition.<br /><br />Gold also writes about the UN failure to prevent nuclear proliferation. Pakistan and North Korea have become nuclear powers in part because of the negligence of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency. At present Iran seems to be on the same path of duping the UN agency , though there is far more publicity around the Iranian case than there was around the Pakistani and North Korean.<br /><br />The UN is presently under fire for the ' oil for food ' kickback scandal in which major UN officials have been implicated. Gold however says that the conclusive proof in regard to the guilt of specific individuals in this particular affair has not yet been conclusively given.<br /><br />As he understands it Gold holds little hope that the UN will contribute to world- peace in the near- future. He does not however advocate the US withdrawing from the organization as he believes that would only cause a backlash against the U.S. He believes  an alternative organization of allied powers might however be able to bypass the UN on critical issues.<br /><br />The UN he shows to be a corrupt organization ruled by anti- democratic forces whose large majority guarantees a difficult future for those who care about human liberty . He too indicates that the powers of China,and Russia in the Security Council guarantee that major free- world initiatives will always be stifled.<br /><br />This book is very clearly written but in a sense it is difficult to read.

His love of his subject his understanding of art his appreciation of those greater than him all make the work inspiring. He writes the lives of the artists, and in the course of this tells the story of Renaissance Art. He begins with Cimabue and in this work finishes with Titian. His climax is in his chapter on his friend, teacher, and model for all that is great as painter, sculptor, architect Michelangelo. Vasari has a technical understanding of painting and so this work is rich in its description not only of the artists' but of their greatest works. It also has anecdotal richness, gossip and as I understand quite a bit of apocryphal material which later art historians will dispute. Nonetheless it is a prime source document containing information about the lives of artists who otherwise would be largely forgotten. But above all I think the work is a tribute to the creative spirit of the artist in service of the Divine .<br /><br />The Penguin edition as I understand it contains only a small proportion( though the most important)of the lives. It is nonetheless highly recommended not only for those who will study this artist or visit the sites at which it is located but for all who are interested in the human spirit in creative struggle and triumph.	2005-01-09

The whole point about Leonardo's or for that matter any true genius' genius is that it is unique, one- of - a kind. There was only one Leonardo and there will not be another. This by the way is true of every human being, but in case of the geniuses more so.<br /><br />However it is possible to consider the rules Gelb gives for enhancing one's own creativity based on his observation of the work of Leonardo. They are: Curiosita: An insatiably curious approach to life.<br /><br />Dimonstratzione: A commitment to test knowledge through experience.<br /><br />Sensazione: The continual refinement of the senses, especially sight, as the means to clarify experience.<br /><br />Sfumato: A willingness to embrace ambiguity, paradox, and uncertainty.<br /><br />Arte/Scienza: The development of the balance between science and art, logic and imagination (\\"whole-brain thinking\\").<br /><br />Corporalita: The cultivation of ambidexterity, fitness, and poise.<br /><br />Connessione: A recognition and appreciation for the connectedness of all things and phenomena; \\"systems thinking.\\"<br /><br />I think that all of this is fine, and that each of us might try to improve their own skills . But I doubt that doing so will make one real poet of someone who is not a real poet, or one real artist of someone who is not an artist.<br /><br />A creator is a name is a signature is a uniqueness is a one- of a kind thing.<br /><br />All the more so in the case of Leonardo. And in the case of each of us whether we happen to be very minor creators ( most of us) or major creators indeed( the very few chosen ones)	2005-01-08

This book is an effort at finding a solution to the Arab- Israeli conflict, or as Gavron prefers to define and confine it here, the conflict of two peoples over one land. Gavron makes an effort to grope toward a solution by sympathetically interviewing people from both sides, people who seem closest to the idea of accomodation and peace. Gavron's fundamental idea is that the basic plan for solution of the 'peace camp' has been mistaken. He believes that it is impossible  given the present mix- up of populations- over two hundred thousand  Jews within ' the West Bank' and over a million Arabs within Israel to divide the land. He advocates instead one unified state that would presently have a small Jewish majority.<br /><br />Gavron has good - intentions and has a real capacity to listen to others and hear their stories. However his whole enterprise is undermined by the false symmetry he works to apply between the traditional Jewish and traditional Arab stances to the problems. i.e. the great majority of Jews have always sought a peaceful answer, and have made generous offers to that effect throughout the course of the conflict while the Arabs have said ' leh' repeatedly and continue to do so. Gavron also does a serious injustice to the Jewish citizens of Judaea and Samaria in indicting them as principal cause of the absence of peace. He makes a very serious moral error in not seeing that there is a world of difference between the deliberate murders of civilians the Palestinian Arabs have been engaged in, and the civilian casualties inadvertently caused by Israeli preventitive acts against terror.<br /><br />Aside from the fundamental misreading of the conflict in this sense Gavron also fails to flesh out his ' one- state - plan'. There is of course no sign whatsoever that the Arabs would agree to such a plan. And there is too no reason the Jews should accept a plan which would mean that in a fairly short number of years the Jewish state would be transformed into an Arab- majority one. For anyone who cares for the historical struggle of the Jewish people to return to their land and establish a state of their own this book's program is a non- starter.at in a fairly short number of years the Jewish state would be transformed into an Arab- majority one.

If all of the literary world or most of it believes that this first installment of Marquez's autobiography is a work of genius that illuminates the human condition in a magical and mysterious way then it must perceive something that I do not. I do not find myself fascinated by the kinds of relationships and people that Marquez describes here. I do not find them to have inner depth or complexity. I do not feel a pulsing beauty of language as I do with Faulkner a writer Marquez has been inspired by and is often compared to. I find the world of Marquez and the kinds of human connections it displays alien to me and my own perhaps more limited more perspective in terms of human loyalty and responsibility. I do not get the ' characters' in a real way.<br /><br />I suppose what I am saying is that I am not certain that my own reading of Marquez is anything other than a mistaken misperception of a very limited in this case reader.

The authors emphasize the importance of the individual valuing their own accomplishments, taking responsiblity for their own life, and using their freedom with wisdom. Berkowitz and Newman who are a married couple of psychotherapists present the work in a very simple and forthright manner, as a kind of conversation in which they answer questions about how to make a happy life.

Malamud is a man of the precise word, the carefully drawn artistic touch, the minor note of beauty which suddenly pains. Malamud is the person of sympathy with the sufferings of his own characters, and with the ideology that this suffering is what makes them most human . In another sense the suffering is what defines the Jews and is where Judaism too becomes emblematic of what humanity is. Malamud travels in different worlds for his stories in the Italy of Fidelman , and in the far off Western regions of America where Jews are very rare and distant strangers.

His major discoveries at the turn of the twentieth century in the papers published in his annus mirabilis 1905 totally changed the way mankind thought about the physical world. In these papers he helped lay the basis not only of special relativity but of quantum theory. Einstein later went on to extend our understanding of the universe with his more comprehensive theory of general relativity which was confirmed in the famous experiment of 1919. Einstein spent the latter years of his life looking apparently unsuccessfuly for a unified field theory which would unite all the forces of nature.<br /><br />Einstein was a legend in his own time, one of the icons of the twentieth century. He played an important historical role when he helped forward the Manhattan Project and the US effort to build an atomic bomb. This is a step he had great regrets about. And the irony and painful truth is that this gentle man was responsible for the discovery which helped give Mankind for the first time in its history the power to wholly destroy itself.

I once learned with a great Talmid Chacham who whenever he was asked about the Kabbalah would say that he had never studied it, and therefore could not answer. This is all to differentiate the traditional Jewish reservation before the study of Kabbalah and the wave of popular Kabbalah study which seems to involve many other kinds of things.<br /><br />Aryeh Kaplan was a great teacher who had a masterful ability to understand and make clear very difficult concepts.

In these essays he often shows his masterful understanding of both. He writes about the ' soul' and the real essence of the human being in a way that gives hope in the whole conception of personal immortality. He explains how it is possible to approach G-d without being able to define G-d, how we can have what he calls a 'direction' to G-d. He talks too of a real hope of a Messianic Age in which death will be overcome, and relates this to modern scientific research . He provides an example of how a person with great scientific learning is not deterred from religious faith, prayer and observance but strengthened in it through this secular knowledge. For me reading this work I felt how much the Jewish world today needs people like Aryeh Kaplan, people who really have a great insight into different worlds of learning . I myself feel as if I miss Aryeh Kaplan even though I never knew him personally. I can imagine myself dialoguing, asking questions in which his faith and his knowledge would perhaps strengthen me in my own struggle for understanding and faith.

In my own feeling the great American poets are few in number. Whitman, Dickinson , Wallace Stevens , Eliot ( if he is an American) and on the borderline Poe Frost and Cummings. This anthology which contains works only up until the early sixties does not thus include today's most well- known active poets. But in my feeling( and it is only that ) these poets do not come to the level of their great predecessors. And here I think Emerson's judgment is correct and the one poet who most embodies the spirit of America at least in its most expansive phase is Whitman.<br /><br />This anthology though contains the work of many very good poets , and thus any real reader of it will certainly have a true idea and feeling of what American poetry is about.	2004-12-23

There is a lot of positive advice that can help people write, and perhaps feel better about themselves and their lives. This is good.<br /><br />But I have been a writer for many many writers , and writing it seems to me is a far more painful, difficult, problematic activity than this book suggests. Writing involves coming to terms in some way with what one cannot do as a writer. It involves dealing with one's own failures and one's effort to overcome those failings. My writing life begins in suffering, warding off madness. It continues in trying to understanding the suffering of others I loved, and what such suffering can mean. Writing is so so many different things that I do not wish to generalize or make my own experience the model for anyone. I just would say ' simple formulas help sometimes' but for many writers the search for the truth in writing does not necessarily lead to some world of happiness or greater hope.<br /><br />Writing has kept me going, helped give meaning to my life, and as with Kafka has been a kind of prayer.<br /><br />I hope this review does not discourage any reader of this little book. And I also hope my few words have indicated to you what you probably already know, writing can be not so simple and so easy.	2004-12-22

Conway as outstanding. It says far more about the book than my brief review will.<br /><br />I found this to be Solzhenitzyn's finest fictional work. It is written with power and conviction. The optimism displayed by the hero in an apparently hopeless situation supposedly mirrors that of the author in his own fight with and triumph over cancer. The tremendous will and courage of Solzhenitsyn which is part of the legend he made with his own life and writing gives too a sense of the heroic in this work. In adversity in suffering in the depths of a hellish world his heroes find a strength and humanity which is incredible.<br /><br />I recommend this work above all for its putting the reader in touch with a kind of heroic spirit a kind of courage which our civilization now needs if it is to overcome the forces of terror now working to destroy it.	2004-12-22

This as the name implies is what comes after the Modern , though one entry assures us that to be post- modern a thing must first be modern. The post- modern with its divided and broken narratives, its multiple interpretations, its seeming transcendence of the idea or ideal of any single right way of seeing a thing or believing a truth is at present in the saddle and riding over all of us. And this though there have already appeared hints of a post- post -modern Age on the horizon.

He tells in a clear and strong way the story of a good part of his long career from growing up in Degania to his great triumphs in the 1956 Sinai Campaign and the 1967 Six- Day War. Dayan in telling the story of his life tells much about the whole process of Israel's development and its struggle against all odds to survive and become a modern Jewish state. Dayan is a controversial figure today in Israel despised by some for the haste in which he abandoned the Jewish claim to the Temple Mount. But there is no questioning the enormous contribution he made to develop the Israeli Armed Forces, and the enormous dedication and courage he showed in a lifetime work of serving his country and his people.<br /><br />This work is highly recommended for all those who would know the story of Israel from one who helped make it happen.	2004-12-21

There was the sense that each and every one knew his life was in the balance and that the prayer and devotion of the day to come could tip the scale this way or that. In this work we learn much about the origin and meaning of this central prayer in Judaism. There are chapters on \\"Vows in Antiquity \\" \\" The Kol Nidrei Formula\\" \\" Kol Nidrei In Historical Interaction\\" and appendices on Versions of Kol Nidrei, and the Music of Kol Nidrei. In the conclusion three significant points are made. \\"1) Each Jewish generation gave kol nidrei a different meaning and significance 2) Kol nidrei has been a source of controversy throughout history 3) In every era Jews were drawn to kol nidrei because of something other than its intellectual content\\"<br /><br />In his \\" The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer\\" Macy Nulman writes of how the chazzan on Kol Nidrei would begin softly and increase with each repetition the loudness of the prayer so intensifying the sense of awe at its hearing.<br /><br />If there is one difficulty I have with this book it is that it did not convey sufficiently the sense of awe at hearing Kol Nidre, an awe which the believing Jew must in a sense carry with them not only on Kol Nidre night but all through the year- at the goodness and greatness of the Holy One Blessed Be His Name.	2004-12-21

She tells too something of the incredibly difficult and limited world she lived in, and of the special difficulties Jews had to contend with to remain alive. Gluckel may go into too much detail and not be the greatest writer in the world but she certainly is a person of tremendous moxie, courageous, dedication , insight . How wonderful it would be if we could have the stories of many others of great value who lived, gave to the world and then passed from it as if they were not here at all.

The writer of the review says that Sartre is Jewish. He is not and so far as I know none of his ancestors were Jewish. The Anti- Semitic reviewer says that the 'Torah teaches hatred of Gentiles' This is outrageous, and stupid. The Torah teaches that every human being is created in the image of God, and that we should love our neighbor as ourselves. The Torah teaches that every human being is of infinite value.<br /><br />As for the Sartre book Sartre does understand a great deal about the attitude of assimilated Jews. However he does not know or understand Jews whose Jewish identity is not formed by ' the other' but rather formed positively through belief in their own heritage.<br /><br />I too think that Anti- Semitism takes different forms at different times, and it is difficult to understand the present kind of radical fundamentalist Islamic anti- Semitism in the same terms as one understands the Anti-Semitism of the extreme left.<br /><br />But with all this there is the point that Sartre was fundamentally sympathetic to the Jewish people and to the sufferings caused by the evil of anti- Semitism.	2004-12-20

It gives a very good description of what the book is about .In one key paragraph he summarizes as follows,the fundamental recommendations of Allison for preventing nuclear terror  \\"No loose nukes, no new nascent nukes, and no new nuclear weapons states. Second, there must be the \\"Seven Yeses\\": Making the prevention of nuclear terrorism an absolute national priority, fighting a strategically focused war on terrorism, conducting a humble foreign policy, building a global alliance against nuclear terrorism, creating the intelligence capabilities required for success in the war on nuclear terrorism, dealing with dirty bombs, and constructing a multilayered defense. For the details of these no's and yeses, you'll just have to read the book. I think you'll find them reasonable and necessary. While Allison suggests a blueprint for prevention, it will ultimately be up to Americans and their government, hopefully in accord and alliance with other peoples of the world and their governments, to implement the policies he recommends.\\"<br /><br />My own review is not about the whole of Allison's book but rather about one particular danger, that of nuclear terror coming from one particular state, Iran.  Allison puts the stress on preventing Iran's obtaining nuclear fuel, and therefore he argues forcefully that what is required is cooperation between Russia which is building the reactor at Bushehr and the United States in assuring that Iran does not retain possession of nuclear fuel rods. But as I understand it the Iranian nuclear program is vast and varied, involving many secret facilities. And these facilities are hidden underground. No one today can safely predict that Iran does not already have nuclear capability. The reason I stress Iran is because Iran has frequently in the past used surrogates to carry out acts of terror. Hizbollah is an Iranian offshoot, and the terror done at Khobar in Saudi Arabia against US forces, and in Beirut against US forces also apparently has Iran's Pasdaran behind it. The Iranians are now too interfering in Iraq and working there to undermine US efforts to set up a stable regime. What I am suggesting is that the Iranian problem is far more complex and needs far more concentrated and radical treatment than Allison suggests.<br /><br />And here I would come to the first part of his book where he talks about various kinds of nuclear terror threat. It seems to me Iran is part of the grand alliance of Islamic Jihad whose aim is nothing less than the overthrow of Western civilization. Just one major terror nuclear terror act will as Michael Ignatieff has pointed out cause such a reaction on the part of US government authorities so as to completely alter American life and freedom.

It seems to me Iran is part of the grand alliance of Islamic Jihad whose aim is nothing less than the overthrow of Western civilization.

In this work he asserts ' reading' to be a life- action, an agon a process  by which we assert our power.<br /><br />\\"Bloom's first chapter on critical and poetic language sums up his systematic procedures and attacks both traditionalist 'humanistic' criticism and recent Continental modes, including Deconstruction. His second chapter centers on the Book of Genesis and on Freud's theory of the origins of sexuality in order to establish three models for poetic originality. The third chapter, commenting on a range of poets from Milton through Stevens, gives a definitive account of the poetric process Bloom has called ' transumption' a technique by which poets come to terms with their forerunners.\\" (From the back cover)<br /><br />This work precedes Bloom's blockbuster works on ' The Western Canon' and 'Genius' and seems more academically jargoned. Apparently the ' strong poet Bloom ' read this work contended with it and overcame it wish his richer and more poetically flowing later masterworks.	2004-12-19

I tried too to make sense of what ' power' meant for Neitzsche without coming in my own mind to a satisfactory understanding.<br /><br />What impressed in the reading was of course the striking aphoristic strength of Nietzsche whose unexpected and very powerful sentences struck the mind like hard hammer  blows. Here was a writer a thinker of startling brilliance, whose thoughts were of value for the purely aesthetic quality , if nothing else.<br /><br />Yet the world of ideas , perhaps not of Neitzsche but of his worst interpreters also resonated from and back into the book. It is wonderful to be a scholar and truly understand what Neitzsche meant with the ' overman- superman' business but this theme was peddled by his own sister and picked up by the evil to justify the murder of millions of innocents. However one soft- peddles it the Neitzschean contempt for those who champion a kind of human equality, leads to a celebration of the ' worst' . \\"Will \\"  \\" Power \\" Conquest\\" unfortunately are words employed by Neitzsche and used by others in ways which are Evil.<br /><br />Can a thinker be blamed for all the misuses made of his ideas? Probably not. But something of the tone of contempt inherent in Neitzche's very strength as a writer leads to darkness blacker than any philosophical light however striking and beautiful can diminish.	2004-12-19

In it Freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason, and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes, our inner unconscious lives. Dreams are not nothing, and they are not in Freud's eyes rare religious gifts, but rather to the key to our own mental life. Freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations .<br /><br />I am not a psychologist and do not consider myself competent to really judge how much of what Freud presents here is valid or even capable of scientific testing.

He also wrote it when he was on the verge of his own personal going down into darkness. So the Destructive and Death- bringing aspect of human character and human civilization are very much on his mind when he writes this work. And he writes in a work in which he sees the forces of death and destruction as inside the gates from birth. Like original Sin for the Christian the power of Thanatos threatens to take the soul down forever. It threatens to make all of human life a hell of constant, ongoing conflict. To this the Mind and Eros its more positive side respond with a power of sublimation, a capacity to transform those evil instincts into constructive building powers, and this as in Judaism the ' yetzer hara' evil urge is ideally transformed into constructive action of the 'yetzer hatov' As I understand it and I do not understand it fully I admit for Freud the dark powers cannot be fully contained or sublimated but always exist at the threshhold of consciousness and History, waiting to manifest themselves again in terrible violence.<br /><br />Who would have believed that little more than half a century after the Allied Forces led by the United States vanquished an enemy which threatened to turn Mankind as a whole into a totalitarian concentration camp, there would emerge a new threat from a different part of the world ( Islamic fundamentalism) in which the darkest powers within us again threaten to make all the light of civilization into an unending desert night?<br /><br />Freud saw something true about the human condition, and this is the perpetual recurrence of Evil. And its perpetual transformation into new forms which may threaten us again and again.<br /><br />Can we contend ? can the other positive forces prevail ?<br /><br />Let us pray so lest we go into a night of nights, in which no books will be read and reviewed on Amazon, no freedom of the individual will be allowed, and all of us will be subject to a narrow dictatorial agressive dominating force which represents the worst in us at this historical moment.to a night of nights, in which no books will be read and reviewed on Amazon, no freedom of the individual will be allowed, and all of us will be subject to a narrow dictatorial agressive dominating force which represents the worst in us at this historical moment.   <br />	2004-12-16

It contains the essence and best of Philip Roth .And while he has developed new themes and new relationships in subsequent writing, the heart of what he is expressed in the most condensed and comical way is in this book.<br /><br />Aside from the comedy the book has a deeply poetic and moving quality. The word he himself uses is ' poignance' and I think this work is filled with this.<br /><br />The book is ethnically rich in its portrayal of a Jewish family but in religious terms it is as empty as Roth himself is.<br /><br />I say this because my reading of the book has always brought great pleasure and with it a certain guilt. And this guilt relates to my understanding that Roth really is 'coming down on the Jewish world he also loves' but at the same time ignoring and devaluating another dimension of Jewish communal experience.<br /><br />I think though that for most readers, Jewish or not, this book will be a tremendously enjoyable read.<br /><br />I believe furthermore that this book catches a certain time and spirit in America. In my mind it belongs with 'The Great Gatsby ' and ' Catcher in the Rye' as one of the twentieth century's contributions to the most living American literature.	2004-12-16

Can there be a more interesting subject than understanding who we really are, and if we discover that?<br /><br />I had hoped that this book would give real insight into the way we know and define ourselves. From the chapters I read and admit not to having read the whole I did not have a sense that there was any development toward ' real understanding of the impossibly difficult and insoluble perhaps question'.<br /><br />What the book does have is a number of distinguished biographers telling something about the way they understand biography. There is also Ludwig's conception of biographical freedom and the way each of us may construct the narrative of his own life. I connect this with an idea in Judaism in which each great sage makes through the story of his life a Sefer Torah that can be read by the generations to come.<br /><br />I think that there is much more to this book than I have indicated. And I certainly would recommend that anyone interested in the subject of self - definition through biography have a look at this book.	2004-12-16

For better descriptions of what this book is about in scientific terms I recommend the reader of this review  look at the other Amazon Reviews.<br />I am the kind of reader who reads the scientific material in order to use it as basis for understanding certain fundamental questions. Science provides the ' truth' and my own thought the conjecture.<br />However what happens when the Science itself is conjecture, and what we are dealing with is alternative theories? From what I understand the most accepted view of the Universe's ' end' in scientific terms is its continuous expansion. Thus a number of readers on Amazon have indicated that the ' contraction scenario 'or ' big crunch scenario ' for the world's end is not held today by the great majority of Astronomers.<br />My question and here I share Davies' concern is not with ' the end of the Universe' the ' last three minutes as it were of everything' but with the ' ultimate fate of mankind'. And I wonder if the kind of material presented here brings to a greater understanding of that.<br />On the one hand it is possible to suggest that Mankind is such a small part of the Universe, and has been in existence for such a small interval of time that its continued existence through the kinds of times and distances the Universe is likely to exist through seems extremely unlikely. Here it is possible to speak about various scenarios of ' colonization' and the human transformations involved in them. Speculations in other words.<br />But then too since Mankind is now rapidly developing ' machine - intelligences' that may in some way become ' independent others' the question of ultimate human fate is connected with our own efforts here. In other words we might not wait until the last three minutes of the universe but might through our own ' creative means' put ourselves to sleep.<br />All this of course raises questions which are ultimately religious or spiritual.<br />And that question too I think should be asked in relation to ' the final time' of the universe.<br />All this leads me to the thought that the real subject we should be thinking about is the subject of God at the beginning or before the beginning, and God at the end or beyond the End. And what that means for us. And what we mean for God?<br />And how we are to make sense of this universe, and whether or not we can at all.<br />This is to say that the kinds of information Davies presents do not help me so much in my own quest to ' understand the ultimate meaning of who I am, who we are, and what my and our purpose is here on this earth and in this Universe.<br />For all those we now living love will end long before the physical Universe does.<br />Is there some other meaning for all of us only God knows ? Is there another universe next door or up above, or in some other way of perception and knowing we cannot possibly grasp?tual.   And that question too I think should be asked in relation to ' the final time' of the universe.

And what that means for us. And what we mean for God?   And how we are to make sense of this universe, and whether or not we can at all.

There have been fifty- seven previous reviews of this book and I looked at them all. Most of them simply express admiration for the book, or revulsion for it. There is little relation in most of these reviews to the objective content of the book, various problems in the study of European history, a comparison of Palmer's approach to that of other text - books.<br /><br />A couple of reviews were informative arguing that though the Palmer textbook does not really present a 'History of the World ' but rather a history of Christian Europe only , it is a tremendously valuable resource. For these reviewers the book provided a credible account of European history.<br /><br />I read this book as a text book in World History in freshman college. What struck me then was the understanding given by the book that on most major historical questions there is a real division of opinion. And that the straightforward narrative can be challenged at every point. There is not history then but a variety of interpretations of history.<br /><br />If I remember rightly this was a workable history without great fire or flair, solid and reliable ,  a good piece of work.	2004-12-15

It contains a moving account of his final struggle against his illness written by the author's wife Ann Druyan. It also contains a lot of consideration of environmental issues. Sagan was one of the greatest of all popularizers of Science, and a very distinguished scientist himself . He was a key person in the whole effort to make contact with extraterrestial intelligence. He was a great and passionate believer in the power of Science and Reason to move Mankind forward. And in fact he seems to believe that Mankind is only a transitional species on the way to some kind of ' higher Intelligence'.<br /><br />It is possible to wonder as one Amazon reviewer has if Sagan does not at certain points become a kind of ' scientific philospher king' dictating to us the wise answer to all our problems. But I do not think such arrogance is his fundamental tone. I think that he was a person who loved exploration, loved understanding, loved astronomy and through these loves gave Mankind much new insight and hope.<br /><br />This book has essays and thoughts on a wide variety of subjects.

Rosen connects Talmud and Internet as ways of reading hypertext, of skipping back and forth, of placing commentary against commentary, of finding diverse worlds in the text. This comparison on one level works while on a deeper one does not. The Internet is easy and children can manage to work on it. Talmudic Study is extremely difficult, tremendously challenging intellectually, requires a very practiced and sharp mind. I learn in a Daf Yomi shiur in which we study each day one page of the Talmudic text. I find tremendous difficulty in even understanding what is going on, much less contributing meaningfully to the discussion. I use the Internet all the time, without much difficulty. I read articles on all kinds of subjects and find understanding no great problem.<br /><br />Rosen uses his comparison as many Amazon reviewers pointed out to help him get into and tell his own family story. He does this in a moving and interesting way. On this level the book truly works. Also his interest in Judaism and knowledge of it is considerable .The problem is he taking the Internet as model tends to use one historical stage of Jewish existence the stage of exile and wandering as Ideal. This is of course in total contradiction with the Tradition itself, whose ideal is not scattering but rather ingathering. Return to Israel, Ingathering, fulfilling the Biblical Covenant are the Ideals Jews held through the centuries and those given in the Tradition. Rosen's private definition of Jewish being everywhere and nowhere at once connects with other such historical definitions such as Neitzsche's about Jews being ' the first Europeans'. But it does not really speak to the Tradition.<br /><br />Another point about the Internet. The Internet enables everyone in the world to say anything they want to say. This is in one sense a miracle and a great realization of human dreams. On the other hand it enables the worst elements - the Evil, the Haters,<br /><br />the Jihadists, Nazis,- all those who diminish our Humanity to have their say. The Talmud on the other hand is a religious text sanctified in its learning. The moral difference between the two kinds of text and activity is night and day. And here I should make the point that the Internet too can and is used for noble purposes. However so far as I know it is not primarily a sacred text.<br /><br />Again this is a thought - provoking and interesting work. Very highly recommended.the Jihadists, Nazis,- all those who diminish our Humanity to have their say. The Talmud on the other hand is a religious text sanctified in its learning.

Sailor whose quite comprehensive review of it appears on this site.I apologize to the author for my review is not really about your book. It is about its subject. I suggest any reader who is not interesting in hearing my reflections on the Jewish century tune out here.<br /><br />I in one way object to the title because I believe the Century could have many different titles. Why not ' The American Century' as it is the Americans who saved the world twice in world- wars, and have been its leader in every important scientific and technological area?<br /><br />What is true that for the Jews the twentieth century was of awesome turning point- significance. One- third of the Jewish people were murdered in this century by the Nazis and their helpers in what is arguably the greatest crime in human history. There was in this century after two thousand years the fulfillment at least in part of the Biblical promise and Jews returned from ninety countries to the land of Israel and helped build a modern state there.<br /><br />A third area of great significance is of course the varied creative effort of individual Jews , including some of the giants of the century Einstein Freud Kafka etc. I think though it is difficult to draw conclusions here in regard to this being because of this ' a Jewish century' It is truly remarkable that less than one third of one percent of mankind produced close to twenty percent of its Nobel Prizes .But eighty percent of those prizes were won by non- Jews.<br /><br />It seems to me and here I hope God will forgive me for this the most significant story of the twentieth century is the vast increase in human power over ourselves and the world. This power is so unsettling that it made lead to the transformation of mankind out of existence. The Tower of Babel is of course a Biblical precedent for this Faustian human story- but the story belongs to Mankind as a whole and not to the Jews.<br /><br />The Twentieth Century is the Century of many different things- it is also the Jewish century- but if I were to choose one I would call it ' Perhaps The Last Human Century?'ntury is the Century of many different things- it is also the Jewish century- but if I were to choose one I would call it ' Perhaps The Last Human Century?'	2004-12-14

It begins in Berlin in 1914 and continues through their separation until Benjamin's tragic death twenty -five years later. Both of them were greatly interested in the historical processes of their times, in philology , in the meaning of signs and symbols, in Socialism, in Zionism. Scholem left Germany for the Jerusalem of pre- state Israel and became a central figure there in the development of the Hebrew University. He became too the great scholar who opened a new field that of Jewish Mysticism. Benjamin hesitated and seemed to always find the way to misfortune. But their conversation and their friendship illuminates fundamental issues of life and thought. This book should be read by everyone for whom the life of the mind is important.	2004-12-14

Essentially they divide into two camps, those who support Birkets claim that the new technological media, primarily television and the Internet have led to a retreat from serious reading, and a general social decline toward more and more superficial relations- and those who argue that book- technology too has its own historical development, is not eternal, and is undergoing a process of transformation through being supplemented and in some cases replaced by other technologies. Among the interesting claims of the reviewers in this second group is the one that ' serious readers' were always a small minority of humanity anyway, and that today there are actually more readers for both books and Internet than there have been in the past. The anti- TV - internet school points out that reading superficial stuff on a screen cannot be compared to deep contemplative reading of a book.<br /><br />In his book Birkets book shows us what he means by reading. He interprets and provides a kind of autobiographical record of his own reading experience. This is in one sense the heart of the book, and perhaps experientially and for the reader it is preferable to the main idea of the book.<br /><br />My own personal view and I speak as one who has loved and been emotionally and spiritually and intellectually helped by books all my life is that the new means of reading given by the Internet also gives new worlds of information, wider and easier access to many different kinds of reading material which once were more difficult to achieve. On the other hand I do feel that there is something ' right ' in Birkets claim that skipping around click by click from one interesting item on the Internet to another cannot really give what sitting alone and 'dialoguing' with a book can. I do feel that there is something ' deeper ' in the book world than in the ' screen world' - at least to this point.<br /><br />Givcn too human physical structure I do not see at this point anyway any replacement to that kind of dialogue one can have with the book.<br /><br />As to the replacement/ augmentation question I think each different category of book might be examined in relation to whether the transformation into an electronic form will make the book obsolescent.It seems to reference books, and certain kinds of popular entertainment might go better on screen. But a book like Birkets requiring thought and attention still has to come to us as a book.<br /><br />This book raises a question that will be with us for some time to come. It is part of the larger question of what it means to be human and what it will mean to be human in generations ahead. This is a book well- worth reading and thinking about , as many Amazon readers apparently already have.l structure I do not see at this point anyway any replacement to that kind of dialogue one can have with the book.  <br />As to the replacement/ augmentation question I think each different category of book might be examined in relation to whether the transformation into an electronic form will make the book obsolescent.It seems to reference books, and certain kinds of popular entertainment might go better on screen.

There are too just too many diarists mentioned and the discussion of them goes from one to the other too rapidly. Mallon breaks his diarists into seven categories, chroniclers, travelers, pilgrims, creators, apologists, confessors, prisoners.<br />The old rule seemed to apply here, and the less I knew about the diarist the more Mallon 's work seemed significant. But for those whose work I do somehow know , and I think here of the example of Kafka , Mallon's treatment seemed to me hasty, and slight. This suggests that another problem of doing the work the way Mallon did is distinguishing well enough between diarists of greater and lesser significance.<br />This book is highly recommended for all those who take interest in the Diary form, for I know of nothing else like it.	2004-12-13

Why if Borges considered himself a poet above all, and if this book contains as it does contain most of his major themes are his real readers and his real fame the readers of his stories essays and short prose-pieces ? Why is the most loved Borges not found in the poems when the poems too do at times like the stories tell stories?<br />Perhaps it is because the language of poetry is more dense and ambiguous and breaks the flow of the story. Perhaps it is because on the nonetheless more extended palette of the story a more extensive picture can be painted. Perhaps it is because too the element of mystery so great in Borges work comes to us in a stronger way in a narrative telling? Or perhaps too Borges whether he likes it or not is in his lists and his recollections really more a figure of prose than of poetry. And perhaps and this the real paradox Borges poetry is too more prose- like than poetic in many ways. Perhaps his way of going on in such intellectual questioning fashion renders his poetry more mind- like and less in deep lyric feeling than the deepest poetry means?<br />I ask this as prelude to saying a few words about these poems most of which I have read, and few of which I remember.And this too is part of it. The Borges name is connected with those tales from The Aleph to Funes to Borges and I . It is less connected with any of the poems<br />And all of this review seems now to me somehow unfair. Borges is a great writer and his words mean more than anything written about them. Reading these poems will give so much pleasure , so much material for reflection, so many characters, stories, moods, ideas, dreams, passages of life, labyrinths, ships, coffee cups, imitations, duels in the sun and duels in the darkness, light as a metaphor and light as light, darkness as darkness and darkness as sight, worlds within and more worlds within and more worlds within and without and words as literature true literature literature of the tradition that the maker Borges makes and remakes and makes and remakes a poem.radition that the maker Borges makes and remakes and makes and remakes a poem.	2004-12-13

The territory covered is great and includes history, geography, anthropology, the economy, modern Jewish practices, thre branches of Judaism . The answers and aim are to in the words of the book jacket develop ' a new empirical worldview that incorporates the teachings of both the ancietn and the modern Jew. Yosef provides a clear conception of humanity's role as God's creation and of the role the Jewish people play as a light unto nations and as leaders toward the messianic age. \\"<br /><br />This is a highly original work which I sense has never really received the attention it deserves.	2004-12-13

It is the Auden of Musee de Beaux Arts and September 1,1939 and Elegy for W.B. Yeats. It is the Auden of memorable lines, ' The universal error bred in the bone , not to be loved/ but to be loved alone'. It is Auden who is a public poet speaking in lines held together not only by internal rhyme, but by a certain majestic authority of statement. It is the Auden whose poetry at its best seems to be saying something significant about the human condition at a particular time of our history.<br /><br />This I know is not the whole Auden but it is rather that part given to the widest audience in anthology - the public Auden. Here I sense Auden's poetry spoke with a clarity and sense rare especially in his own time.<br /><br />He does not have the music of Yeats and Wallace Stevens at their best. He is not as some readers on Amazon have suggested the greatest poet in English in the twentieth century. But my own sense he is one of the best.	2004-12-12

He tells essentially how his hunger for knowledge led to the great self- education which is preparation for the writing of his work. There is also the story of his falling in love, and his obedience to his father's rejection of the match. The great turning point moment of his life is described as follows,\\" It was at Rome , on the 15th of October 1764,as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol ,while the barefooted friars were singing Vespers in the temple of Jupiter, that the idea of the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind.\\"<br /><br />The majesty of the great prose style of the 'Decline and Fall  is also felt in this work.	2004-12-12

The 'Aeneid ' like the pious Aeneas himself was for me one of the works most difficult to get through. Plodding, serious, structured and fierce it moves ahead like a Roman legion devastating and conquering all before it. There are of course humanly moving  elements in the work, the cry of Dido at her abandonment by Aeneas, the burning of the city and the dramatic rescue upon the shoulders, father and son- but the work as a whole including its many battles and slayings rated high along with Spenser's ' Faerie Queen' in my mind as one of the most boring of all the great masterpieces.   <br />This of course says more about my own limitations as a reader than it does about the work itself. And I should at least mention the virtues of loyalty and courage so clearly embodied in this most Roman of works. However no matter how I try this celebration of Augustus Empire, this Roman prelude to the greater Dante always seemed to me so relentlessly humorless , <br />as to be skimmed through rapidly rather than really chewed and digested.	2004-12-12

There is madness here and method in the madness. There is a story, a heroine, and her meeting with zany characters and a zany world whose rules seem to change with each person she meets. There is wordplay, and there is logical laughter and conundrum. There is seemingly something for everyone.<br /><br />It is possible to be frightened to near death by the Queen of Hearts or to become broken and wise like Humpty Dumpty .\\" Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall/ Humpty Dumpty had a great fall/ All the kings' horses/ and all the Kings' men/ could not put Humpty Dumpty / together again.<br /><br />The weird wonderland Alice meets is filled with games and play. It is fantasy and fear, it is fun and fright. There is at one point no way out of it and yet there is miraculous transformation which takes you somewhere else completely.<br /><br />The logic of this world seems at time too sophisticated for children, and yet childlike . Paradox is contradiction with the pain taken out.<br /><br />There are so many memorable lines and situations here, so much to mean in each sentence , that the work is a wholesale factory for epigraphs and epigrams.<br /><br />As one who never followed the story very well I nonetheless could see that in this work poetry and logic meet and mix each other up for the general benefit and pleasure of the reader.<br /><br />This is a book to be read line by favorite line, character by favorite character, incident by favorite incident with amusement and pleasure.	2004-12-12

It is the work which will define for many throughout the generations the fundamental Christian way of thinking about the world. Unfortunately this means it too is tarred by a fire- and- brimstone replacement theology which ruled Christian thinking in regard to the Jews for close to fifteen hundred years afterward.<br /><br />The work sets up the basic contrast between the Good and the Evil, those who are part of the City of God( whether on Earth or in Heaven) and those who are in the City of sins, condemnation, and death. Augustine is a great teacher of doctrine, and his doctrine divides the world into the saved and the damned. If you are not going to be with the Church then you are not going to live. His idea in short is an absolute idea, and his great intellect argues to support a way of understanding the world which is total and complete.<br /><br />The intellectual challenge presented by this book is great indeed. And in it one of the great minds of religious history expounds his fundamental teaching.<br /><br />As one who belongs to a people and religion condemned in this book I cannot simply sing its praises. But it is impossible not to recognize the great scope and power of the mind at work here.	2004-12-12

He spoke often of searching for ' peace of mind'. And I think a book with this title is of course of most interest to those who are disturbed, restless, anxious troubled who in short have ' no peace of mind'. In this sense ' peace of mind' is not an exotic condition or an absurd goal. An ordinary mind which functions without feeling pain is in some sense in ' peace of mind'. And anyone who has been troubled in mind  and comes to a kind of  rest 'knows what 'peace of mind 'is. So I commend the work, not because I believe its various suggestions will in a fullproof way lead to 'peace of mind' for anyone, but because it may be of help. And apparently this work has helped thousands of people. And one more point. Help is not necessarily total. It can be some small tip inside which the person sees and which just suits them and their situation which gives them the bit of daylight they need to come out of a dark time.<br /><br />This is not a fullproof answer, but it may be worth trying to receive help.	2004-12-09

When he brought his family to Israel for a year he did not know the dramatic turnabout they would come to face. The terror- war which the Palestinians launched when the Clinton brokered peace - process broke down in late September 2000 means his family is exposed to a kind of violence they had never imagined. In clear and informative E- mails to friends he tells the story of this year of what his family goes through. A person of the liberal left, a super- tolerant idealist he comes to understand that it is not enough for one side to want peace, but rather that both sides must. He becomes more passionate in his defense of Israel when he understands that really it is a country subject to aggression fighting for its own life . He too confronts the hard questions of his own family members, his childrens' suspicions that they are being sacrificed on the altar of their parents idealism. This book is important precisely because Gordis is clearly such a ' man of peace and good- will'. And because it shows how complicated and difficult the struggle of  Israel is for life and peace.	2004-12-09

It is a tightly written and in a way poetic narrative, troubling and moving. A very highly recommended work.	2004-12-09

I read the book with a strong sense of its being a sincere effort to understand how to truly mourn for a  parent.  I did however sense what one reviewer on Amazon a Mr.Wexler pointed out, that the author says little about who his father really was, shows no great personal connection to him. I too in truth was bothered by the question of making use of a religious rite, or participating in it when one shows an absence of faith in the religion itself. And this raising the real question of what we actually are doing when we are saying Kaddish. If we are not trying to lift up the person's soul, if we do not believe that G-d is truly listening to us then what are we doing?<br /><br />When I said Kaddish for my father it led me into deeper and deeper connection with the Jewish community , and I would even dare to say brought me closer to G-d. People are different and there is no reason the author of this book should necessarily have gone through a Teshuvah experience in saying Kaddish. But in a way that is what the Tradition truly demands. And that is one aspect of truly honoring and respecting the memory of a parent.<br /><br />I appreciate the many deep meanings found in the author's explorations but I would have been more positive toward the work had I sensed it was in some way moving toward being a real religious example for others.	2004-12-09

It has also led to endless speculations as to what the closing of the frontier has meant. And it too has led to speculations about the search for new frontiers including the one in space. We went as far as we could to the West and then we went up.<br /><br />I cannot evaluate the accuracy of the Turner thesis. I remember however that his idea that it is precisely the settled people of the East, the veterans who head out for the West gave me the idea of Americans as a people in constant motion away from their old and hopefully toward their new and better self.	2004-12-09

His building and achievements in Jewish education in Israel have few equals. In this stimulating book of essays he examines the spiritual life of Israel. He argues passionately for a more open, a more responsible Judaism. He dialogues with his great teachers Rabbi Joseph Dov Baer Soloveitchik, Yeshayahu Leibowitz, Mordechai Kaplan and respectfully differs on various questions in Jewish thought. He above all shows a true devotion to Israel as a Jewish society . These essays should be read by all who care for the future of the Jewish people and Israel.	2004-12-09

Rabbi Abraham Millgram Z\\"l was a very learned Jew . He is also an exceptional writer. What he does here is blend both deep historical knowledge and great religious knowledge to tell the story of the way Jews pray. His explanations are superlative. I would also point out that this book is a comprehensive one,and consists in interesting essays<br /><br />on a wide variety of subjects. Here is a brief excerpt his introduction to his discussion of the Siddur.<br /><br />\\" The Siddur differs radically from any other book of prayer past or present. It differs in content not only because of differences in belief and tradition, but also because of its unique history. It was not composed by an official body charged with the task of producing a prayer book for the synagogue. The Siddur grew slowly over a period of many centuries. To grasp its unique development and its singular character we must cast our eyes far back in history , for its roots are sunk deep in the soil of the Jewish past, reaching back more than three thousand years. The story of the Siddur must begin with a brief account of the ancient mode of worship which prevailed during the days of the First and Second Temples.\\" p.39<br /><br />Any one who wishes to augment their Jewish knowledge is strongly recommended to read this work.	2004-12-08

When I read it years ago I was not the ideal reader. The whole atmosphere of sin and guilt was difficult for me to take. There was a gloom in it which I wanted to escape from. It was hard for me too at that age and time of life to give full attention and sympathy to a female protagonist. What did I have to do with this Hester Prynne? Chillingworth the avenging husband was cold and unsympathetic as death . And Dimmesdale too standing hypocritically on the pulpit and preaching a morality he himself violates also did not appeal to me. In some way I did not even understand what Hester Prynne did so wrong , and why they were tormenting her so. A backward and benighted society, a narrow morality a lack of love and tenderness. Well these of course are all of Hawthorne's points as he pits the traditional, narrow morality which becomes immoral and inhumane in persecuting the person who has done wrong, Hester, but who in response to the wrong acts with nobility and humanity. I too must admit that I could not understand how Hester could give up the child, Pearl. In any case with the years it seems to me that when I read this book I was not really ready to understand it. I could not do it justice.<br /><br />Hawthorne's sentence,\\" Until the heart is touched we do not begin to be\\" seems to me a lesson illustrated powerfully here through  Hester's 'evil ' deed and its  redemption in her noble conduct thereafter.	2004-12-08

Robert Alter uses the techniques of literary criticism to deepen our understanding of the Biblical text. He shows us methods and themes which illuminate the text in a way we have not seen before. This is not in my opinion a question of his having found the right interpretation, but rather of revealing yet another of the ' panem' the various faces, seventy, traditionally through which the Biblical text is interpreted.<br /><br />Alter interprets the text in a clear non- jargoned language that is refreshing .<br /><br />Here he explains something about his approach,\\" This sort of critical discussion, I would contend  far from neglecting the Bible's religious character, focuses attention on it in a more nuanced way. The implicit theology of the Hebrew Bible dictates a complex moral and psychological realism  in biblical narrative because God's purposes are always entrammelled in history, dependent on the acts of individual men and women for their continuing realization. To scrutinize Biblical personages as fictional characters is to see them more sharply in the multi- faceted , contradictory aspects of their human individuality, whichis the biblical God's chosen medium for His experiment with Israel and history. Such scrutiny, however, as I hope I have shown , cannot be based merely on an imaginative impression fo the story but must be undertaken through minute critical attention to the biblical writer's articulations of narrative form. \\" p. 12<br /><br />This work as Alter makes clear is intended for both students of narrative, and students of the Bible. There is much to learn here.	2004-12-08

Books	5	51	51	N	N	Intersubjectivity is the answer	There was a time in my life when I read and reread this work. This does not mean that I understood it fully. But the idea of 'intersubjectivity' and that it is through being with and understanding others that we become most truly human is one which had great influence on me. It took me away as I was looking to be taken away from a kind of philosophical solipsism a kind of sense that all should rest only in 'I' and 'I' that would prove upon reflection 'unstable as water'. Marcel is a humane thinker, one who tries to take us from the celebration of Nothingness and Death to the celebration of life in community with others. I doubt that he is read much today in the English- language world, but to my mind he is a very valuable and helpful thinker . A mensch of philosophy.	2004-12-08

Maritain is a kind of poet philosopher whose meanings are not readily translatable into the kind of language I understand. But there is a sense in reading him of something good and well- intended, of something right. His theory concerning the way the mind works in the making of art, his emphasis on creative intuition does make sense. But my guess is that in our over- interpreted world of discourse it cannot make single or final sense. It is one interpretation.  <br />This small review is to do nothing more than say than anyone interested in philosophical connections between art and literature, anyone interested in the creative process might do well to turn to this work.

The music of Poe is undeniable - and his memorable lines remain rhythmically in mind. \\" The glory that was Greece,and the grandeur that was Rome \\" \\" Said the Raven, \\"Nevermore\\" And then too \\"In her home by the sea, Annnabel Lee\\".<br /><br />But the great innovator in literature, inventor of the modern mystery tale, the tale of ratiocination, the psychological thriller, is Poe the storyteller.<br /><br />But unlike many readers I am not a particular fan of fictional horror, feeling that life itself supplies enough of this particular quality. So I can remember even in grade - school not really taking to the \\"Fall of the House of Usher\\" or \\"The Tell- Tale Heart\\" because being at the time a very scared person who had a lot of fear in his world, I did not want fictional fear to augment what I already had.<br /><br />I also did not like the vague mystery, the sense of looming threat and non- understanding which seemed to me to come with these stories. But of course one particular reader's emotional predilections do not define what a writer truly is. For many these tales of mystery and horror are Literature at its most interesting and fulfilling.<br /><br />For me Poe's fiction had a weirdness about it which too could be connected with this strange step-son's biography. The expulsion and formal failure at school, the strange love for the child- bride, the haunting sense of loss in love. And then too the dissolution and drunkenness , the wasting away.<br /><br />To my mind Poe is not on the level of the greatest American writers but lingers a bit below threatening them. All that is warm, tender, humane and normal seems somehow outside the universe of Poe. To make an unfair comparison. Tolstoy too was driven by his demons and at times verged on a kind of madness. But he gives us a world in love and feeling and beauty that Poe does not come close to knowing.<br /><br />Nonetheless Poe is a genius of literary creation, and his works richly reward the reader in their magnetic and  fascinating beauty -rd the reader in their magnetic and  fascinating beauty -	2004-12-08

Eliot	Books	4	6	14	N	N	The Tradition read again with the years	When I was in graduate school Eliot was considered the great literary critic of the twentieth century, the person who set the tone . His understanding of the Literary Tradition and how each new author altered the way we read the whole was part of the ' religion' of literary studies. So too his essays on Dante and on the Metaphysicals ( his placing Donne at the center of the Tradition) and his famous reading of Hamlet in which he argued that there was emotion in excess of the objective situation, i.e. that there was no appropriate 'objective correlative'. As a graduate student I somehow went along with the crowd and did not have much to say about Bleider with a Burbank,and Bluestein with a Cigar' i.e. the culturally anti- Semitic Eliot. That Anti- Semitism along with a certain racism and anti- Feminism are too we have learned parts of the Literary Tradition .So some of the most beautiful and great works of literary creation are marred by moral failings. How ironic that Eliot who was a spiritual teacher in time should have been so faulty in this way .	2004-12-08

They bring together Jews across the religious spectrum from Adin Steinsaltz and the Bostoner Rebbe all the way to those who have no faith in a personal God. There are moments of insight and revelation. It is always of course possible to ask why Haberman did not select others. I myself would have preferred to read a work  in which the same kinds of questions were asked to people of strong faith in G-d. And this because I myself am interested in the strengthening rather than the undermining of my own religious faith. In any case I believe readers who take an interest in Judaism can learn from this book. Rabbi Haberman who undertook this work at the age of seventy should too be complimented for her own courage and devotion in doing so.	2004-12-08

Nor is it a review of the entire corpus of Frost's work. Rather it is a few thoughts about Frost as a poet.<br /><br />Frost is a poet American schoolchildren meet early. Thus \\"Whose woods these are I think I know/ His house is in the village thought. and \\" The Road Not Taken\\" and \\" Good fences make good neighbors\\" and\\" The land was ours before we were the land's\\"  are all titles, lines which have remained in mind from an early age. They are the poetry which we having memorized young remains forever a part of us. Thus there are Frost lines in me , and I do not deny this.<br /><br />Frost nonetheless despite my having read quite a bit of his poetry, and recognized its clear and high quality has never become a great favorite of mine. Why ? It may have to do with a certain fierce coldness I feel in him ( Some will die in fire , and some in Ice) Frost is in short for me a poet whose work is admired but not deeply loved. This connects too with my sense of who Frost himself was, his great ambition and according to his biographer Laurence Thompson great cruelty. Frost in my feeling lacks some redemptive quality which would lift him into the realm of Hopkins or Stevens.<br /><br />This does not mean that he is not a very good or perhaps even great poet. It means only I find him distant his birches swinging for others somewhat remotely closer , perhaps, the stars.	2004-12-08

As a child I loved to read 'facts' and this provides much reading of that kind. Consider for instance its lists of distinguished writers painters spiritual figures. Or consider its country portraits with statistics on basic characteristics of political life and economy. My sense however is that with the coming of the Internet the ' Almanac ' is not quite as vital a tool as it was once felt to be. My sense is that the Information given in the Almanac can be found in the Internet in a quick search. And that for those people who sit and work with their computers a good part of the day , the Almanac would be much less looked at. This does not mean it should be discarded and that many including myself will not continue to purchase it. It is after all much more pleasant to shlep around with a book than with a computer. But the Internet and the 'Information Age' have made ' facts cheap' and made much of this information so easily available and readily duplicable that the resource simply is not the kind of special value it used to be.	2004-12-08

I do not have a strong scientific background and so tend to let some of the more technical arguments go by me. But I did follow the overall thrust of Davies argument and he does make a good case for the idea that the discovery of extraterrestial life is an essence a positive phenomenom. In  the  concluding paragraph of his fifth chapter , on 'Consciousness'he writes,\\" If this view is correct if consciousness is a basic phenomenon that is part of the natural outworking of the laws of the universe, then we can expect it to have emerged elsewhere.The search for alien beings  can therefore be seen as a test of the world view that we live in a universe that is progressive, not only in the way that life and consciousness emerge from primeval chaos, but also in the way that mind plays a fundamental role. In my opinion, the most important upshot of the discovery of extraterrestial life would be to restore to human beings something of the dignity of which science has robbed them. Far from exposing Homo sapiens as an inferior creature in the vast cosmos, the certain existence of alien beings would give us cause to believe that we, in our humble way, are part of a larger, majestic process of  cosmic self- knowledge.\\"<br /><br />Davies also in the course of the book makes arguments for the idea that human venturing into the cosmos, true space travel of any great significance is impossible. ie that physically we are not about to conquer the cosmos. He too suggests that the whole cosmic process of creation might be seen as one of evolution toward greater and greater complexity. In this again Humanity's meeting another kind of higher intelligence would seem to him to fit into this scenario of an overall Cosmic Process in which the development is toward a kind of total Consciousness.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this work not simply for the ideas it raises but for its clarity in argument and presentation.<br /><br />I would just add that a ' meeting with other minds more advanced than us' has always seemed to me a troubling possibility as I in my childlike way assumed it must mean that this compromises God's special relationship with humanity. I now am perhaps less troubled by this than by the possibility that we human beings are not going to wait to meet the ' higher consciousnesses without' but rather invent them from within. And this too raises the question of the ultimate meaning and mission of mankind .Here I turn in my thought to the Jewish idea of Mankind working with God to help complete Creation to do the Tikkun Olam which is the fixing of the world. But how this is to work out exactly and what this would mean should we truly meet minds of another civilization I  would not now even begin to speculate about.<br /><br />This book helps raise questions of ultimate significance, and in this sense I  believe it an extremely worthwhile one.meeting with other minds more advanced than us' has always seemed to me a troubling possibility as I in my childlike way assumed it must mean that this compromises God's special relationship with humanity.

This is his concluding paragraph of this chapter: \\"As I have said, the first words we utter in the morning are Modeh Ani, I thank YouG-d, for restoring my soul and giving me another day of life.

I never somehow really 'got into ' his fictional works. This memoir however was different and I was deeply moved by it.<br /><br />His story of his childhood in Czernowitz, the relations within his family, his special connection to his mother who was murdered by the Nazis , his being torn out of his childhood world, and sent with his father on a death march, his escape and life as a child in the forest and with a prostitute who makes him her servant and alternately terrifies and fascinates him, his hiding, and moving about , his finding his way to the ship which will bring him to the new home in the land of the Jews, his difficulties in accomodation , his being an outsider here even where he is supposed to be at home- all this is told with great restraint and power. Applefeld himself seems to radiate a certain kind of calm, the calm of what he has described himself often as ' the observer' the one who ' waits and looks' and tries to understand. His early efforts at writing are also described here and the contradictions between what others expected of a ' Holocaust writer' and what he himself had to give. The sense of loneliness is palpable in the last pages of the book where he tells of his coming to belong in the club made of those from his former home - region .The dissolution of this club with the years is the loss of a second home.<br /><br />As with Oz in his also remarkable memoir \\" A Tale of Love and Darkness\\" Applefeld does not delve into the present reality, into the world of the new family he has made. He says he walks around and at times ' he is back there' and this work gives a real sense of what that ' there' is. I have not in this review really come close to touching on the richness of this memoir, its emotional depth. It also has great horror in it, and there is one scene one story that sticks out in my mind and which bothers me even now as I write this. It is about one camp that Applefeld came to. In this camp the Nazis had a special kind of corral in which they would throw babies, who would be devoured by German shepherds. When I think of this I wonder what the words ' forgiveness' and ' humanity ' can possibly mean. This fills my heart with such horror and sorrow, I don't know what to say. I apologize for picking out this one detail and emphasizing it so strongly .The work has many scenes and much perception of and wisdom about life. Applefeld has written a masterful and moving work. He is one person who survived the horror and has conducted himself in his life with quiet courage and great human dignity .He should be seen as  a hero in the creation  of Literature,  not only for the Jewish people but for Humanity as a whole.one camp that Applefeld came to.

Her analysis of fundamental concepts such as Authority, Truth, Freedom, Action are fundamental in that they go to the root morning of the term and trace the concepts transformations in reality. Her narratives are generally narratives of decline and loss, of concepts and experiences that somehow lose their meanings in the transformation of time. And this while she is always searching for some kind of redefinition of fundamental political activity and reality that will bring a new dignity to the human condition. Her writing is profound, and whether one agrees with her or not her analyses always ' educate' and make ' the life of the mind ' seem especially meaningful.<br /><br />This is one of the best works of one of the great political thinkers of the modern world.	2004-12-06

It seems to me that Richard Schwartz has done us all a service in trying to move us toward a better world through implementing these fundamental Jewish values.<br /><br />I say this without wholeheartedly agreeing with his analysis of the situation mankind is.

Challenging this view David Roskies places the Holocaust , and the literary responses of victims and survivors, in the context of generations of Jewish response to persecutions , pogroms and communal catastrophes.\\"<br /><br />This is the second last paragraph on the final page of the book.<br /><br />\\"Catastrophe, in fact , has always been a part of the process of rethinking the past. Like the rabbis of old who worked with any and all available materials- cultic, prophetic, apocalyptic,gnostic,mystic, platonic- so long as they could bridge the abyss left in the wake of the Great Catastrophe , the writers and artists of the nineteeth and twentieth centuries mixed symbol systems,juxtaposed sacred and profane, borrowed ferociously in order to face their ever- greater losses. Just as the Temple destructions were consciously fashioned into archetypes by the exiles in Baylonia and by the Tananaim and Amoraim, so the new destruction, the Holocaust, was lifted from the straight line of allusions back to the old archetypes and inaugurated into its own archetypal nature.\\" pp..310<br /><br />I understand that the interpretation of Disaster has been a fundamental element in Jewish life down the centuries.

Here is a great genius of mankind, recognized throughout the world as an immortal creator of Literature. He is the father of a large family and has a wife he has loved and who has loved him. He has great wealth .In other words here is a person who seems to have almost everything most human beings strive for in their lives and do not attain in any way close to the level at which he has attained them. And yet it all turns meaningless to him, and he in despair asks the question of whether there is anything to truly live for, what can give life true meaning. For he too senses that Death will take him and all his worlds, and their meaning away.<br /><br />His answer comes from within his own personal Christian faith. It is not a formal church faith but rather has to do with the message of God he hears in his heart, the message of love for all of mankind. Meaning is to be found according to Tolstoy in living in a spiritual way in which stress is placed in goodness with others and sharing with them whatever one has to give.<br /><br />The meaning of life is living according to this voice of God he hears within.<br /><br />This is the answer Tolstoy gave, but the evidence of his life suggests it did not satisfy him. For his questionings and doubts persisted throughout his lifetime, and his life did not end in some great gesture of affirmation and love but rather in his running from the once- beloved wife, who for years had embittered his life, as he hers.<br /><br />This work cannot of course compare to Tolstoy's great novels in scope or even in human interest. It is a look at a great man's ' soul' at one stage of his life but in giving that life omits many of the great skills Tolstoy made use of in other writing.<br /><br />As spiritual guide it has never seemed to me to provide the kind of answers to life meaning I have been looking for.<br /><br />Yet I understand how it may be of much help and consolation to all those who have suffered crises similar to that of Tolstoy.s similar to that of Tolstoy.  <br />	2004-12-05

Sagar maintains that Lawrence's special quality as a poet is his emotional realism. And it seems to me undoubtedly true that Lawrence is powerful in his expression of his feeling. But then the question which might be asked is why the lines of Lawrence do not somehow sing in our memory , remain with us as for instance the lines of Keats, Hopkins, Yeats, Wallace Stevens do?<br /><br />Why is it despite Sagar's objection that the consensus is probably right in seeing Lawrence as primarily a novelist, and only secondarily as a poet?<br /><br />Here is a fine small poem of Lawrence from this book.<br /><br />DESIRE IS DEAD<br /><br />Desire may be dead<br /><br />and still a man can be<br /><br />a meeting place for sun and rain<br /><br />wonder outwaiting pain<br /><br />as in a wintry tree.<br /><br />And one more small example.<br /><br />WHATEVER MAN MAKES<br /><br />Whatever man makes and makes it live<br /><br />lives because of the life put into it<br /><br />A yard of India muslim is alive with Hindu life<br /><br />Anda Navajo woman, weaving her rug in the pattern of her dream<br /><br />must run the pattern out in a little break at the end<br /><br />so that her soul can come out, back to her.<br /><br />But in the odd pattern, like snake- marks ont he sand it leaves its trail.<br /><br />Am I wrong to think to think these poems are too prosaic to be the greatest poetry ?	2004-12-05

He is probably the all- time best explainer of science to the layman that the world has ever known. His mastery and competence in most areas of scientific learning is a tribute to his great intelligence and persistence in learning. He is considered by those who know the field one of the premier writers of Science Fiction. He wrote something like four- hundred and seventy books, and provided to his readers a little library . His ideas, especially those on the ethical code for Robots are now part of the intellectual legacy of mankind.<br /><br />With all this he had his limitations which were in a sense the limitations of his virtues. His work on humanistic subjects on the Bible and on Shakespeare reveal the same kind of one- dimensional quantitative mind so suited to explaining science and so poor to comprehending humanities.  Poetic complexity is simply not part of his make- up.<br /><br />This autobiogrphy has the same kind of flat surface and tone that Asimov's other writings do. It is possible to fault him  on all the countings , all the self- serving business of trying to establish his own value by counting up the numbers of things he has done. It is possible too to fault him for his bad relation to key people in his life, including his first wife and son. It is possible also to see that his great scope in learning was achieved at a price in depth. Asimov is not a poetic, and not a religious and not a truly literary soul. But again he is a person who has contributed a tremendous amount to the broad public's understanding of Science.<br /><br />As I do not believe ' numbers can be the true measure ' of the worth of what is most important I have a quite reserved attitude toward Asimov. A unique and distinctive and in many ways remarkable figure but by no means a great writer.	2004-12-05

He writes with great knowledge of the complex Tolstoy of innumerable paradoxes and contradictions. Tolstoy is arguably the greatest novelist of all time and yet at times he despises mere literature. Tolstoy aims to be humble and yet cannot abide the literature of Shakespeare because there is the chance that Shakespeare might be greater than Tolstoy. Tolstoy loves and admires his wife and has a large family with her yet comes to despise her and betray her . Tolstoy preaches celibacy and yet indulges himself with peasant women he owns and exploits. Tolstoy in Isaiah Berlin's concept aims to be the hedgehog who understands all reality as one great system and yet is truly a fox in his remarkable observations and understanding of nature and society. Tolstoy is a raw awkward bear of a character who nonetheless develops into a sincere and mature responsible citizen and landholder. Tolstoy is the man of wealth who sits and works with the peasants and would give everything to them. Troyat portrays the contradictions and has the narrative power to sweep us along in telling the story of this giant of world literature. Surely one clue to the endless search for meaning is his loss of his mother when he is two. But every explanation falls short , and it is difficult to make full sense of this remarkable mixture of greatness and difficulty, of wisdom and idiocy , of genius and simple human stupidity , of love and indifference to those he is closest to , which is Tolstoy.<br /><br />The book tells the story but the mystery remains, as is perhaps true with the life of every person , great or not.	2004-12-05

My other problem is that I do not particularly want to read in a work I am enjoy quotations from certain abominable monsters such as Nazi leaders whose memories should be dust. This of course is not the fault of the editors and the monsters of history often are remembered and quoted when their victims remain silent.

They write:\\" In each society Jews see themselves as part of an extended family, with a common descent and destiny and a special obligation and responsibility toward one another. In addition they use the memory of their collective past to draw lessons about  the present... Nevertheless even though the two groups have  common cultural heritage , each has reinterpreted the heritage differently.<br /><br />  For example the land of Israel and the concept of galut have been central to the vision of most Israelis and virtually ignored by American Jews. \\"<br /><br />  The authors in their final chapter maintain however that two Judaisms have not emerged and are not likely to.  They express their discontent with both the American Judaism which they feel has watered down the content of Judaism by becoming so cosmopolitan and universalist, and the Israeli Judaism which is too parochial and partisan for their taste.<br /><br />  The copy  I have of this book was published in 1990 and much has happened to complicate the Jewish reality both in Israel and the United States.

But the reader should understand that the Talmud is not a book to be read by oneself and understood by oneself. I believe that that is impossible. The Talmud must be studied with others, and this is the way traditional Jews ' learn' it. Thus however valuable this reference work is it cannot be a substitute for ' learning ' the Talmud. For this one must connect with some kind of Jewish communal framework, and connect too with those who have wider knowledge and experience. The study of Talmud is intense, difficult but it is the basic form of study religious Jews have engaged in for generations.

His  focus  is in reading of Hasidic and  Kabbalistic sources. Gafni  tries to connect these sources  with the teachings of other religious faiths, mainly  of Buddhism. Thus his work has a New Age flavor and in a sense works in both the direction of opening traditional Jews to other religious traditions, and helping non- Jews and assimilated Jews more deeply appreciate the depth and importance of the Jewish religious tradition. In this regard it is important to note that Gafni has been a central figure, in efforts to reach out to the secular public in Israel. And in this regard he has both been the moderator of a television program focusing on Jewish spirituality, and has created his own retreat center in the Galilee region of Israel.<br /><br />  All this is commendable, but the actual nature of Gafni's text, and the values he teaches in it raise certain questions for the traditional observant Jew. Gafni's focus is on the individual, and the individual's path to a higher spiritual life. This approach avoids incorporating much which is central to the whole Jewish tradition in spiritual life. Gafni does not talk about Halachah, or Mitzvot, and never uses the concept of `obligation'. Communal values are not at the heart of is enterprise. This immediately casts a certain shadow over the work. This shadow deepens when in the course of the reading there is no mention made whatsoever to specific connection or loyalty to the land of Israel, to the people of Israel, to the G-d of Israel.<br /><br />  Now it can be argued that it is precisely this narrow Jewish particularistic approach that Gafni is seeking to overcome. He is speaking as a man to mankind, and as it were individual Jewish spiritual teacher to individuals of all faiths and kinds. Therefore, the kind of communal and particularistic obligation which he omits is perfectly logical and the context.  The question however is then one of whether Gafni is really teaching Judaism or in fact teaching is his own particular brand of the faith, Gafni-ism which however inspiring and instructive does not seem a genuine possibility for those with traditional Jewish religious commitment.<br /><br />  Gafni elaborates his own theory of the special spiritual connection that the individual must have with God, and life. Gafni calls this key relationship, an erotic one. He says it has four components, and models the relationship on that which was held to be the fundamental experience in Jewish Temple worship, the relation of the cherubs. For Gafni this erotic relationship( which he says is not encompassed by, but is `modeled ` by the sexual relationship) is the key to the mystery of love.<br /><br />  In the one passage of the book where he talks about the four faces of the erotic together he does so in relating them to sexual experience. The four faces of the erotic are \\"Being on the inside\\", Intense yearning, fullness of presence, the interconnectivity of being.\\"  In the key passage he writes, All these qualities are essential to great sex.\\" Being on the inside\\" means not on the inside of your sexual partner, for that is limited to the masculine sexual experience. Rather it is about being on the inside of the experience itself.. Yearning is the essence of the sexual. So much so, that it is often thought by poets and psychologists to be more pleasurable and intense than the fulfillment itself. Interconnectivity is nowhere more clearly manifested than in the sexual drive. We are born with an urge to merge. Finally, it is in the sexual where -in its ideal expression-we are most fully present to each other. Every gesture, fragrance, sigh and whisper ripples through us as we listen deeply to the erotic instructions that well up from the depth of our soul's body.\\"<br /><br />  The claim  that the \\" sex models the erotic\\" would be more persuasive had he more richly dealt into other realms of experience. But somehow the `model ` the ` sexual experience' gets a great deal of space here, almost as if what we are hearing is that we can make all life a ` peak experience'.<br /><br />  In one sense it is possible to understand and sympathize with what Rabbi Gafni is trying to do. He is trying to awaken the bored, and the tired of which there are plenty in traditional religions, including the Jewish religion. He is trying to shake up the complacent and the dead inside and waken them to a sense of life `s exciting possibilities.

It urges toward a greater faith in one's own ability in action. I personally however found it somewhat limited in that written in the state of Israel it uses all kinds of examples from domestic and work life without once referring to one major area - perhaps the major area in which courage is required in Israel, the military. To my mind anyone who wants to speak of courage to the Jewish people in Israel has to consider Klal Yisrael and our obligations to it. And this means thinking also about the obligation to physically defend the Jewish state.	2004-11-30

But the book proved to be too much of a good thing. It is one thing to have the guilty pleasure of finding out the details of the personal life of one's hero but when that takes one through five marriages and numerous affairs the soul begins to weary. Atlas also whether he wanted to or not gives the sense of Bellow as a kind of narcissistic, selfish person who does not really show proper consideration of those closest to him. This image was for me in a way disappointing and there is the sense that the person who has created so much vibrant, and life- giving literature must essentially be better than this. One thing however the book certainly does underline and that is Bellow's determination as a writer, his devotion to his work, the sense of his own special destiny which he bore with him all the time.	2004-11-29

Many readers refer to it as a great book, and some as the greatest that they have ever read. This is in stark contrast to the critical evaluation of the work given by professionals, academics primarily. For them Wouk is a ' middle- brow' writer whose powers of character creation, language, are not very great. Here I must confess that ' The Caine Mutiny' is one of those books from which I have a stronger memory from the movie , than from the book itself. Many readers have referred to the masterful character creation of Captain Queeg, of his once contemptible and yet sympathy- arousing character, of the story of the development of Willie Kieth from crude and selfish young man to responsible sailor and hero. Many too suggest that Wouk's ending of the work is masterful. And all point out how wonderfully readable the book is.<br /><br />My guess is reading it will not only help the reader understand something about American life during the Second War but will also give an insight into American values and attitudes in the 1950's.	2004-11-29

I did not like the work, and not because I did not find parts of it absorbing and moving. I do not like crime. I do not like murder and violence. I found it difficult to sympathize with Raskolnikov and understand why I should give somuch of my attention to such a person. The murder of the old woman is in my perhaps simplistic mind, an evil for which one should be silenced. Instead we get hundreds of pages of the hero's remorse. If I were asked what I really remember about the work it is the confession of the drunken character who tells his whole life story and suffering to a total stranger. The dialogue of Dostoevsky is always one of his strong points, and in this speech too one feels great power. The suffering of the child, the single child which stands out against the Heavens as evidence of an unjust world and God also moved me deeply. I admit I am far from the best reader of this work. Dostoevsky has always repelled me a bit even before I knew of his anti- Semitism. The fascination with the morbid and the criminal has never been mine. But the power of the work and the word and the comprehension of character and experience are very great indeed. I suggest the reader turn to far other reviews for more full and more objective informatiion.	2004-11-29

It seems to have something in common with a more recently published popular book ' Emotional Intelligence' by Daniel Goleman in that it focuses on understanding the other, empathizing with them and cooperating with them. It connects too in my mind very strongly with the Jewish Ethical Work 'Pirke Avot' which speaks about greeting every person with a pleasant countenance, and in another of learning from each person we meet. I think the underlying message connects with that fundamental religious teaching of loving our neighbor as ourselves, of really giving the other such respect and such understanding that they come in time to honor us also.  I understand the Dale Carnegie work goes into much more detail in regard to using this kind of connection to achieve personal success, primarily financial. But I would suggest that the very act of understanding and respecting and listening to another is in itself of tremendous good .For ideally it means that we can make if not a close friend, then a kind of friend of each and every person we meet and speak with.	2004-11-25

In the second Berlin argues that the notion of historical inevitabity is untenable and that our everyday life and historical experience require a kind of liberty . In the third he makes his famous contrast between freedom from, and freedom to, or for. And in the last he explores the political thought of John Stuart Mill one of his great predecessors and through Mill's mirror develops some of his own ideas.<br /><br />First and above all Berlin stands against the idea that there is a single system or idea an absolute which all Mankind should be coerced into obedience to. Berlin in his thinking points to the plurality of ends and values in life, and the contradictions between various systems of values. He is a liberal philosopher who connects the dignity of Mankind with this liberty from external coercion and oppression.<br /><br />His writing is profound and yet somehow conversational and flowing .<br /><br />This work contains the heart of the thought of one of the great political thinkers of our time.	2004-11-24

Modern man, accustomed as he is to determining his destiny by himself ,with his own capacities and strenth- is not prepared, even in this respect, to suffice with passive anticipation for that day, and he asks: What shalll I do? Is there an answer to this question, in terms of the hope of Israel? It seems to me that the answer would be: learn, with the whole of your ability to learn, all that you can of \\" devekutch\\" ( communiion with God)! Learn in the place where you are within the circumstances, complexities , joys and sorrows in which you find yourself, learn through these involvements, to understand - with heart, not head- the meanings that emanate from them. No one can take this task from you. No one else can do this work for you. Faith speaks to you and me, and it relies on the experience of those greater than us. The world is not blind, is not meaningless. Redemption awaits us just behind the curtain. It is not given to an individual man to draw this curtain aside and bring about the redemption. But he isn't compelled to sit and wait, without doing anything. It is given to him to be a partner in the act of redemption.

I often learn from the Artscroll Commentary and appreciate it. It does use a wide variety of traditional sources. It lacks Hertz's breadth , willingness to encounter the world outside, effort to see Tannach through non- Jewish eyes always. Its translation too reflects this tendency to insularity which I believe costs the Jewish people a great deal. Again I learn from this Chumash, appreciate its excellent presenting of traditional Torah knowledge including reading of Midrashim. But I think it lacks Hertz's broadmindedness and Hirsch's magnificent sublimity .It is a more down- to - earth kind of work. I cannot help but feeling it reflects a  certain change which from my point- of - view is regrettable in the Jewish world, a change from being ready to intellectually challenge and meet with others, to one in which we hide within our own insularity.<br /><br />This is a good Chumash but I can imagine in my mind the Jewish people creating a far better one.	2004-11-24

He seems to be more honest in confessing his faults and sins, more relentlessly petty in finding faults in himself than anyone had ever been before. He concentrates on himself without that dimension of connection to higher questions and realities that Augustine has. He also reveals himself to be in many incidents most especially in relation to the mother of his children and his children a quite contemptible human being. For me the most memorable incident in the Confessions is when Rousseau wagers with himself and wins the wager not by throwing the rock at the tree from the distance as he was originally to test himself by doing, but rather by going up to the tree and making sure he does not miss. The Rousseauian wager that is one conducted in fundamental dishonesty with a goal of pettily promoting one's own self- interest.

And all this before wakening Kant from his dogmatic slumber, and moving our ultimate understanding to a realm of paradoxical antinomies we still are not able to extricate ourselves from.	2004-11-23

This is especially so for those who enjoy very lengthy and detailed descriptions of basic physical actions. Parodies of scholarship and learning are central, a humanist which supposedly puts Man in his proper place, an unending listfulness which finds catalogues too can be a source of delight, characters for whom our sympathy does not matter profoundly as they seem more allegorical representations than real characters. The genius of a mind inquiring for itself and mocking what it has been endlessly retold. Out of this skeptical , ironic, vast intelligence comes a comic masterpiece I have always found almost impossible to read, and honestly to my own limitation, not that funny at all.	2004-11-23

The truth - value of a proposition is not in its mirroring reality but rather in its consequences. \\"Ask not the meaning, ask the use\\". would be a a subsequent formulation. James as a philosopher also gave the idea of a finite God ( god) devoted to good who needs our efforts to help counter the evil of the world. He gave too the sense of the twice- born soul, and the conquest of depression through ' rebirth' that informs the \\"Varieties of Religious Experience\\". James did not however give a complete system of philosophy nor apply his basic ideas to all areas of life, including Education. His follower Dewey would do this for many years. Yet as Professor Cushing Strout has pointed out James' thought had a missing arch, lacked a deep sense of history and therefore somehow comes up short in speaking to life as a whole. For myself James remains an exemplary figure especially in the work done in the 'Varieties ' but one whose philosophical thought fails to answer my deepest soul's needs.	2004-11-23

His moral values his concern for the dignity of every human being his desire for peace in the world are felt strongly in the text.His overall prescription and hope is that the major civilizations of the world can through tolerant recognition and acceptance of each other bring great benefit to mankind as a whole. As an ideal prescription and formulation ' The Dignity of Differences' makes great sense.<br /><br />But as a realistic assessment of where Mankind is and what precisely is going on within these Civilizations there is something lacking here. Any consideration of the present world situation which aims at providing some new and better direction has to look realistically at the character and goals of the major civilizations. The value of recognizing and tolerating others which Rabbi Sachs so rightly promotes is at this historical moment not the note which Islamic Civilization is ready to hear. In Huntington's Clash of Civilizations he spoke about an arc of confrontation in the world in which Muslim countries in thirty some odd places are engaged in aggressive violent behavior against neighbors. Islamic fundamentalist terrorism  denies the fundamental premise of all that Rabbi Sachs is trying to teach. There is an assymetry between the Civilization which has to be recognized if there is going to be real progress toward a better world. Rabbi Sachs has made a valiant and admirable try here in offering a better way for the world. Unfortunately this does not address the ' threats' of the moment , threats of terror and violence, also by states  which can bring disaster to Mankind. Let us hope and pray that Mankind will get in some years time into the position where all civilizations will recognize and tolerate the legitimate place of others.	2004-11-23

What gave DeTocqueville the capacity to understand fundamental characteristics of American life in such a way that even today his categories of description are  meaningful to us?<br /><br />DeTocqueville so some of the unique qualities of the American genius,the American capacity for association and free action together, the capacity to deal with the small details of everyday practical life while dreaming in the broadest terms.He saw the danger in this most democratic of societies of a tyranny of the majority which might make real freedom in difference of opinion difficult to maintain. He foresaw that two giants , the United States and Russia would at one stage come to take over the center of world political life. He marvelled at the rich capacity of Americans to risk and set out for the country ahead, to be pioneers westward.<br /><br />He saw much about America which it is still possible to see today. And yet given the vast changes technical civilization has brought about, given the tremendous developments in all areas of human learning it is difficult to say that DeTocqueville can be the true and proper guide to the path of American democracy today.<br /><br />What can be said is that he was the pioneer social observer who saw more into the essence of America than any native American did. And in doing so he left us a great literary classic rich in profound observations most of which are of course are not even hinted at in this small review.	2004-11-22

From what I heard no one really addressed Hannah Arendt's moral failing in showing such insensitivity and coldness to victims of the Shoah in her book 'The Banality of Evil'. They too did not see two other areas in which she despite being one of the great political thinkers of the twentieth century failed her own conception of the ' dignity of man' One was in her reluctant and apologetic attitude toward her own Jewishness, and the second in her deference to the Nazi - sympathizing Heidegger. I would also say the whole celebratory tone of the conference as if the world had changed and now everyone understood that Arendt was after all right about the ' Banality of Evil' conference seemed to be wrongheaded and in itself slightly immoral.<br />An additional work on the Arendt failure in relation to her covering of the Eichmann trial.<br />Hannah Arendt is without question one of the premier political philosophers of the twentieth century. However in her account of the 1961 Eichmann trial in Jerusalem she failed miserably. She failed as a reporter, and even more importantly she failed in moral judgment. She painted a misleading portrait of Eichmann as banal clerk, pathetic ineffectual nothing. But in fact he was an embodiment of human evil. Deborah Lipstadt's recent retelling of the Eichmann trial, and the new evidence relating to what Eichmann actually thought and said at the trial show that he was a calculating deceptive monster whose intention was total extermination of the Jewish people. At the trial he was out to save his life, and so worked to present a false picture of himself.<br />Arendt failed in another area of her study. She in her high- culture arrogance and contempuous attitude toward the leaders of the Jewish councils in Europe- all of whom had completely impossible tasks- i.e. trying to save some portion of the people while dealing with those determined to exterminate them all- showed her own failure in human sympathy.<br />It is painful and ironic that Arendt who so stressed in her writing the faculty of moral judgment showed such a complete absence of moral judgment in writing this work. This work is of a piece with another shameful side of her history. i.e Her pivotal role in rehabilataing the image of her mentor and former lover Heidegger who both identified and acted as a Nazi in the German university world. These two failures of moral judgment put a tremendous stain on her reputation.<br />One more point about her contempt. She showed great contempt for Israel's first Prime Minister and great founding- father Ben - Gurion. She claimed he was making it a 'show- trial'. But before this 'show- trial' the Western world was largely indifferent to the horror of the Shoah. One accomplishment of  this trial did was to make humanity more aware of its own capacity for Evil and Destruction.rminate them all- showed her own failure in human sympathy.

I have not heard these talks, but Rabbi Sachs is one of the most remarkable speakers I have ever heard and I am sure that they are very powerful radio. They read well and convey basic messages of optimism, and faith in life. Rabbi Sachs almost always connects the world problem he discusses with some piece of wisdom from the Jewish tradition and does this in a most effective way. While it might be possible to fault him for being a bit superficial in dealing with certain problems he generally is sensible and good- willed.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading these small essays because too they reflect Rabbi Sachs deep knowledge of and committment to the Jewish tradition.

He also had a good heart and gave a lot of charity. You could feel it. He wasn't one of those embittered types. He made it and he enjoyed.

How does one measure within oneself the meaning of these various times and timescales? What do the numbers say to us? Are they simply meaningless ciphers, figures we learn? In other words there is some disassociation felt on my part here between the ' scientific information' presented and the human meaning it can be given.

There are times when one's own personal relation to a work of literature seems mistaken even to oneself. Anna Karenina has always seemed to me a poor cousin of War and Peace a book I have loved from my early teenage years. And this though there were characters and scenes which I deeply loved. Not Anna Karenina, but fumbling Tolstoy alter ego Levin was at the center of what I most cared for in Anna Karenina. His long struggle to find his way his awkwardness his transformation in love were to me something to identify with and take heart from. Anna's story and Vronsky's appealed to me less. Heartless Vronsky I did not like, and I too somehow resented and disliked. Why did women fall precisely for this kind of character so unlike myself? How I wondered could Anna betray her husband even if he was not so interesting or alright? Wasn't it the job of a wife first of all to be faithful, and wasn't anything outside this simply sin and betrayal? In other words I had one side of Tolstoy's equation the wrongfulness and sin of the adultery without understanding really the other side , the passionate love that comes out of desperation? So too I must confess that it was difficult for me to deeply identify with and understand ' a woman's story'.All this says I am afraid little about Tolstoy's novel and much about the limitations of one in this case not particularly perceptive reader of it. Thinking back on it now I remember being moved by the death- bed scene of Levin's brother. I do think too of the broad expansive feeling of life there is in Tolstoy's literature. Many have remarked that no one describes nature in such a natural way as Tolstoy. There is of course so much in this book that I did not grasp, that others have experienced and known through it. Perhaps the level of Tolstoy's imagination , his emotional grasp of human life and character is simply so much greater than mine than I could not grasp it. Great works of Literature need readers who love them. I failed the test with this one.ith this one.	2004-11-19

There is a certain aura of mystical meaning, of something hidden and beyond coming through the world of appearance.

There is a unique language of sensual and philosophical words .There is Love and Understanding and Presence and Absence and God.<br /><br />I know I have not defined it for anyone , even for myself.

A newfound(or newly recognized) appreciation of the role of choice and creativity in the forging of useful and coherent world-systems offers the first hope in modern times of creating a comprehensive and intelligible God- oriented and God- worshipping metaphysical system.Religion can now look at science not as an intellectual rival or threat, but as a model for the important act of constructing a world - view based on spiritual values and tenets of faith.<br /><br />Drawing upon examples of Jewish practiceRabbi Soloveitchik shows how fine points of Halkahah deal with the most essential aspects of human existence, contributing to the necessary and wholesome task of constructing a universe congenial to the God- worshipping individual.\\"	2004-11-19

He tells of his own experience in the Shoah and of being saved through the generosity and caring of fellow Jews who helped a total stranger. He makes the case that this kind of caring for Clal Yisrael and for each and every member of Israel was characteristic of the generation prior to the Shoah. He writes in the hope of restoring to Am Yisrael a deeper sense of this kind of caring for each other. He writes too out of a great concern for the factionalism and misplaced emphasis on one's own small group's way at the expense of consideration for other Jews.

It contains the account of very great  sufferings . For in considering Halachic questions raised in the Shoah(Holocaust) Irving J. Rosenbaum  recounts actual historical incidents.  In his acknowledgement he expresses his gratitude to the most important source for Holocaust responsa Rabbi Ephraim Oshry's Teshuvot - mi-Maamakin (Responsa from the Depths) In the editor's preface he talks of those who were heroes during the Shoah 'believing Jews who summoned up and unbelievable and invincible dedication to God and Judaism, and to life itself'. In impossible circumstances they strove to live in accordance with the Jewish way, the way of Halachah. These are the chapters of the work, Holocaust and Halakhah, Matters of Life and Death, Prayer, Study and Martyrdom, \\" How Does One Bless?\\" Bearing Witness, The Appointed Seasons, Out of the Depths.<br /><br />I will cite one harrowing event  of the many related in the work.<br /><br /> \\" On the eighth of Heshvan 5702 (October 29,1941) a day known to Kovno Jews as \\" The Black Day\\" the Germans commanded that all the Jews from the ghetto, under penalty of death, assemble in the Demokratia Platz for a selektion. Some thirty thousand, men, women and children stood before the Gestapo selector,Raukah, on a stormy , gray day. Snow and rain mixed together fell on the faces of the victims and mingled with their tears. No one knew whether he or his loved ones would return alive.<br /><br />In the crowd of Jews, a certain Reb Elyah from Warsaw, a refugee who had futilely thought to escape the Germans by fleeing to Lithuania from Poland, approached Rabbi Oshry. He knew, he said, that  many thousands of those who stood there that day would be killed on the morrow. He, too , might well be included in their number. And so he asked what was the proper and precise form  of the benediction to be recited before sanctifying the name of God through martyrdom. Was it ' all kiddush ha- shem' who has commanded us concerning the sanctification of the Name'? Or would it be more correct to say le'kadesh et ha- shem' - who has commanded us to sanctify the Name? Reb Elyah wanted to know the correct benediction not only for his own sake. He proposed- as perhaps his last mitzvah on earth to pass among the throng of Jews packed into Demoktratia Platz and teach it to others so that they, too might recite the benediction which the din- the law required.<br /><br />Rabbi Oshry instructed Reb Elyah to recite the benediction as it is found in the Sheneh Luhot ha-Brit (Sha'ar ha-Otiot 1),'le' kadesh et shemo ba'rabim' who has sanctified us by His commandments and commanded us to sanctify His name in the presence of many.\\" He indicated that according to Riva, the use of the word al in a benediction is restricted to commandments that could be performed in one's behalf by an agent.Since kiddush- ha- shem was obviously not such a mitzvah , it would require the use of the infinite with the lamed l'kadesh.

So much has been said about it in so many ways that I will free to chip in my less than two cents without doing the reviewer's ordinary task of describing the work, and telling the reader what it is all about. Bloomsday is a day on the literary calendar of the world. And Daedalaus, and Leopold Bloom and Molly are with K. and Falstaff, and Sancho and Pickwick in the cast of world - literary creations whose image is part of the collective human consciousness generation to generation as most real human beings are not.<br /><br />Ulysses is not easy to read even if one takes a Gilbert Stuart or some other modern guide , and figures out what each section with its own separate style, technique, theme parallel in the Odyssey is all about. And there are parts and not simply small parts which bore in their incomprehensibility as only Finnegans Wake will exceed. But there are also, and this is all through the work great lyrical passages of course culminating in Molly Blooms yes I said I will yes. There is too I suppose the particular pleasure of trying to figure out all these literary mysteries and these hidden hints in the multi- layered language of the text. Already Joyce here is moving toward the creation of his own language and the portmanteau and pun principles are richly at work. In Oxen of the Sun he writes the history of the English language parodying its styles. And the whole theme of parodying rewriting alluding to the great work, and somehow superseding it are in the frame of the work ( Before Bloom and before Daedalus there was a real Ulysses) Joyce's effort to write in one day the whole of human experience and to make too of the form of catalogue encyclopedia a higher way to art is part also of the transformation of popular forms into the highest art forms. Shakespeare did it on many levels and so must Joyce, as Hamlet Daedalaus reminds it. Ulysses at publication time was revolutionary to many in its putting on the page the lusts and obscenities , the sexual thoughts and even ' experiences' of its characters. It too broke the frame of convention in a whole host of other ways including through the shifting centers of its narrative consciouosness- the way it tells and does not tell its story. The sheer lyric musical beauty of Joyce's prose is poetry at its best .And the epiphanies on oval leaves are revelations of the beauty in language itself its sheer joyful joycean playing. And how can I having read through with dismay so much of the hidden and not so hidden anti- Jewish character of so many in the Tradition not be hearted by the warm feeling which flows toward the good souled Leopold Bloom. If I were to complain about graduate school time reading through the longest longeurs in Joyce I would nonetheless always keep in mind that one wee bit of an Irishladdie allalone went out there and by himself only made a masterpiece all mankind can make its own by reading and rereading before running on to riverun from bend of bay to swerve of shore past Howth Castle and environsalaus reminds it.

In one the 'Ultimate Patience Formula' he tells us that if we repeat the message \\" I will make the Almighty's will my will \\" it will help you be more patient. i.e. if you view anything which is happening to you as happening because it is the will of G-d it will make you more patient.<br /> In another chapter he teaches ' Don't exaggerate' because exaggeration will make you more impatient.<br />I remember reading this book and feeling that I would in the future better know how to be  patient.<br />But today I was impatient most of the day having long ago forgotten the lessons this book taught.<br /> Rabbi Pliskin is  not to be blamed for my character faults.

In this work he criticizes the academic practice of focusing on literary theory and babbling in abstract  terms rather getting down to reading and enjoying the texts themselves. In this work he shows what he means by reading by reading some of the world 's great literature including the Bible, Shakespeare, Stendhal, Dickens. His book is structured into discussions of fundamental aspects of literature, character and its connection with reality, style, structure, allusion and what he calls 'perspective.'Alter is a brilliant ' close reader' and he continually illuminates the text in language which is clear and free of technical jargon. This is his conclusion,\\" Reading is a privileged pleasure because each of us enjoys it, quite complexly, in ways not replicable by anyone else. But there is enough structured common ground in the text itself so that we can talk to each other, even sometimes persuade each other, about what we read: and that many- voiced conversation, with which, thankfully, we shall never have done, is one of the most gratifying responses to literary creation, second only to reading itself.	2004-11-17

She calls it a ' psychological biography' Its chapters are: The Censored Name, the Identity Crisis, the Road Back, the Thorbush, Before the Law, Escape , Fiction and Reality.<br /><br />Here is a small sample of her analysis\\"If one attempts to deal with him from the standpoint of a theologician, of a philosopher, of even of a literary critic, it turns out that Kafka is never where the concepts want him tobe; he never quite corresponds to one's view of his interests and aims, especially not in the realm , so inadequately described, of his relations with Judaism and the Jews, where every writer tends to appropriate him according to the writer's own requirements. Assimilated Jew, anti- Jewish Jew, anti- Zionist, Zionist, believer, atheist- Kafka was indeed all of these at different times in his development, sometimes all at once( he wrote Investigations of a Dog in 1922 at a time when he had almost become a militant Zionist) but none of these characteizations throw the least light on the underlying reasons for his struggle , or the form it took, or explains how it was possible for the pathological indecision of a constantly torn man to give rise to the most rigorous modern art, the only art, perhaps in which modernity and rigor have really been combined. \\" p.27<br /><br />One more point . In her first chapter Robert connects Kafka's hiding , censoring of his name not only with his Jewish identity but with the Biblical prohibition of writing the Divine Name, of spelling it out explicitly.

These include Osip Mandelstam,Walter Benjamin, Gershom Scholem, S.Y.Agnon, Lea Goldberg, Uri Zvi Greenberg, Charles Reznikoff and Bernard Malamud.<br /><br />In this work as opposed to his previous one 'After the Tradition' Alter focuses not on the relationship between the Jewish writers and their historical experience but rather on the imaginative strategies in confronting their own historical moment.<br /><br />As always with Alter there is a great clarity to the writing, and a rich interpretative skill that deepens our understanding of the literary work in question.Here is a typical passage of the work in which he illuminates the situation of three different writers at once.<br /><br />\\" According to a Hasidic tale that Agnon himself, among others , has transmitted , the Baal Shem Tov used to go to a certain spot in the forest when he had something difficult to perform, where he would light a fire,then accomplish the task through prayer. His disciple, the Maggid of Meseritz, could no longer light the fire, but at least he knew the appointed place and the prayer to recite. A generation later Rabbi Moshe Leib Sassov had lost the secret of the prayer as well, but he still knew his way to the place in the forest. At the end of the line Rabbi Israel of Rizhyn, the great - grandson of the Maggid, could neither light the fire nor say the prayer nor find his way into the forest, but at least he could tell the story. This is very much the condition of Kafka, and of Agnon left to tell stories when what is urgently needed is the secret path, the holy fire, the divine words. Benjamin was preeminently a critic who knew what such storytelling meant, and understood in all its ramifications the condition of being bereft of fire in the trackless dark of this world. p.61ramifications the condition of being bereft of fire in the trackless dark of this world. p.61	2004-11-17

These are the observations not of a literary critic but of a fellow writer and creator.<br /><br />A few gems:<br /><br />\\" Both Gogol and Ivanov were constantly pestered by impatient people rebuking them for their slowness; both were highstrung,ill- tempered, uneducated, and ridiculously clumsy in all worldly manners.\\"<br /><br />\\"One will observe a queer feature of Turgenev's structure. He takes tremendous trouble to introduce his characters properly , endowing them with pedigrees and recognizable traits, but when he has finally assembled them all, lo and behold the tale is finished and the curtain has gone down whilst a ponderous epilogue takes of whatever is supposed to happen to his invented creatures beyond the horizon of the novel.\\"<br /><br />\\"Tolstoy is the greatest Russian writer of prose fiction. Leaving aside his precursors Pushkin and Lermontov , we light list the greatest artists in Russian prose thus: first, Tolstoy, second, Gogol, third, Chekhov, fourth Turgenev.

Salinger that I have not seen in print elsewhere. It gives those of us not in the know the idea of what one of our favorite writers has been doing all these years. It of course does not tell us who Salinger really is, and what is the secret if there is one of his great literary ability and popularity.<br /><br />As a longtime and repeated reader of Salinger and as a person who actually met and spoke to him once I do not believe I have much real understanding of what to me is the key question i.e. How is it that a person who wrote such great literature seems in his everyday life so ornery and petty? How is it that a person who champions ' higher ideals' seems so unkind in relation to all the people he has known? Is it the early fame that drove him to this? Or is it the fact that as often is the case the person of genius simply is not such a wonderful human being?<br /><br />What I see is that the kind of selfish life Salinger has lived ( the life of every artist in a certain way) raises the question of whether the hidden treasure trove of Literature he has been accumulating is an esoteric bore or more of that remarkable revelatory stuff that he gave us in \\" The Catcher and the Rye\\" \\" Nine Stories\\" and to a degree in \\"Raise High the Roof Carpenter \\" \\"Seymour an Introduction\\" \\"Franny and Zooey?\\"<br /><br />One other point. Salinger certainly deserves a better a deeper a more interesting work than this piece of biographical journalism. He could surprise us all by doing it himself and giving us a spiritual autobiography of depth and beauty. I for one doubt that he will do this . I think he made a critical tactical mistake in his ' spiritual search' in not having at least tried at some point to seriously relate to the vast and intricate and infinitely deep and beautiful Jewish spiritual tradition . But this is something he has always run away from.	2004-11-17

On two occasions, twenty centuries apart , we find a struggle between a world that is still interpreted in a sacred context and men who are already committed to their individuality, that is to say, armed with the power to question. In both cases , the individual increasingly asserts himself , the blance is gradually destroyed and the tragic spirit falls silent.When Neitzsche accuses Socrates of having dug the grave of classical Greek tragedy, he is right up to a certain point- exactly to the same extent that it is true to say of Descartes that he marks the end of the tragic movement born of the Renaissance. In fact, the traditional Christian universe is called into question by the Reformation, the discovery of the world and the flowering of the scientific spirit. Gradually, the individual stands up against the sacred order of things and against destiny. Shakespeare then throws his passionate creatures against the simulataneously evil and just order of the world. Death and pity invade the stage and once againthe final words of tragedy ring out \\" A higher life is born of my despair\\".despair\\".	2004-11-17

In their introduction they caution,\\"The modern society based on the principle of reasonable thought was supposed to achieve the ' good soicety' not only by creating economic prosperity but by eliminating wars,violence, despotisms,and dogmatisims. It didn't.The post- modern society that emphasizes the role of the imaginary , expressed in cultural traditions and legitimized as a reason for its pluralism is a fact. Thus, the pluralist society in its turn gives right of existence to numerous types of culture, to a cultural pluralism.Not only the culture of each nation but of each ethnic group, of tribal societies, of forms of religions rediscovered from ancient times, or einvented now with each system of tribal customs and behaviors, are considered legitimate in the process of forging a personal or collective identity.They furnish not only une raison d'etre , but the only real reason and eventually, the only moral values for the existence of these entities.\\" p. xiii<br /><br /> This complex reality is addressed in four parts, Values and Culture in the PostModern world, Social Development and Policies in Contemporary Society, Societies in Transition Eastern Europe,<br /><br />The Jewish World Pre- and Post-Holocaust.	2004-11-16

His vision of Mankind grew out of his scientific researches and his religious faith and is essentially a synthesis of both . Chardin pictures the universe evoloving toward Man, and then with the coming into being of Man evolving in a new way in what he called the Noosphere.The evolution of Consciousness which could be conscious of itself was a vast upward moving process .In his words, \\"One may say that until the coming of Man it was natural selection that set the course of morphogenesis and cerebration, but that after Man it is the power of invention that begins to grasp the evolutionary reins.A wholly inward change, having no direct effect on anatomy: but a change, as we now know, entailing two decisive consequences for the future. The first is an unlimited increase in the aura of influence radiating from every living being; the second ,even more radical, the prospect afforded to a growing number of individuals of being joined together and ever more closely unanimised in the inextinguishable fire of research pursued in common\\"pp.307-8 As de Chardin envisages Mankind's Evolution is moving toward some kind of ' single consciousness' He asks , \\" May we not imagine that at that moment a truly and totally human act will be effected for the first time, in a final option- the yes, or no answer to God ,pronounced individually by beings in each one of whom the sense of human freedom and responsibility will have reached its full development? \\" p. 321<br /><br />I am not sure what this ' vision' is, and how this ' end of mankind ' in consciousness of God will manifest itself. The vision by the way seems to me to parallel to one I am personally connected with that  of the great Jewish thinker of evolutionary redemptive development Rabbi Abraham Yitzchak Ha- Kohen Kook. I would too make one point about my own reading of the ' end of mankind'. I would ask of what good it is for all of us to be absorbed in some great vision if this does not mean that the ones we love, their personalities and lives do not individually live ?<br /><br />But that is my question, and for those interested in a grand Catholic religious vision of the development of Mankind this book certainly is an answer.ll of us to be absorbed in some great vision if this does not mean that the ones we love, their personalities and lives do not individually live ?  <br />But that is my question, and for those interested in a grand Catholic religious vision of the development of Mankind this book certainly is an answer.	2004-11-16

The great narrative drive, the tremendous skill in creating vital characters, the richly descriptive and often ironic language are aspects of Dickens genius.But somehow the world of Dickens dark and gloomy and Victorian and so British reality never really appealed to me. This says nothing however about the quality of the work and its great gifts to the reader. The book  is the portrayal of a society, and of a moral education. This is a book about the formation of a character through experience, about learning from life's difficulties and disappointments to become a better person. It is about ' recognition' not only of one's own true and better self, but about what is important in life. This book as Dickens himself has had enormous influence on Western literature. I think of two very different writers, Kafka and Salinger both of whom clearly had Dickens in mind in certain points of their writing. Pip, Magwitch , Joe Gargary,Miss Havisham,  Estella  are living characters in the heart of Western literature. The book then I believe is far greater, far more than my own reading has given me of it. Not always apparently does the reader do justice to the work.	2004-11-16

Even today there is a whole group of Hasidism who consider him their ' rebbe' and walk in his way. The great presenter of the Hasidic message as he interpreted it to the Western world , Martin Buber in this work presents an introduction to the life and work of Rabbi Nachman, and presents six of his tales which he translated to German and which have been translated from the German by Maurice Friedman. These tales are truly 'parable-like  mystical tales' and compel the reader to seek new interpretations of them. The volume concludes with an essay by Buber on Rabbi Nachman's Journey to the Holy Land. This is an excerpt from the concluding chapter. \\"Herein the land of Israel, the purification of the imagination takes place.It is not for nothing that the sounds of the word adama soil, and medame imagination , resemble one another: the fullness of the elements comes to the imagination from the earth.But the purification of the imagination by faith can take place no other way than through the consecrated earth and the consecrated earth is here in the land of Israel\\".	2004-11-16

This is a sample of Alter's polished and insightful analysis \\" Agnon's Hebrew is an intricate echo chamber, constantly and deviously recapitulating the literary and theological history of the language as he deploys it. Symbolic reconfiguration of familial and other materials in his fiction is also a repeated interrogation  of the values of the present through those of the past, and vice versa. Ecclesiastes and the Book of Judges , medieval Hebrew poetry and the Zohar, resonate weirdly through Israel in the age of archeological discovery, which is the setting of Edo and Enam. Of course, such a process of highly charged intertextuality is by no means unique to Hebrew, but it finds an unusually congenial medium in the long tradition of Hebrew. an urgent, often surprising dialogue between different eras , extending to the microscopic articulations of the text, was a distinctive feature of Hebrew literary expression, at least through the middle decades of this century, and even as we approach the century's end, there is at least some evidence in current Hebrew writing from the poetry of Yehuda Amichai to th avant- garde novels of Yoel Hoffman that the millenia- long dialogue is far from done. p. 188	2004-11-16

There is reason for this. The theme is an eternal one, innocent optimistic idealistic  youth confronting the realities of the world, and being slowly disabused of his idealism. Voltaire takes on Leibniz whose views are represented by Candide's teacher Pangloss( Everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds). Voltaire writes with great satirical skill of the numerous misadventures of Candide who after them all comes to the conclusion that ' it is best to cultivate one's own garden' . One reason I never fully enjoyed the book is my sense of a certain predictable slaptstick element in which the cruelty preceding is certainly about to be followed by the cruelty to come. And this too has to do with a feeling a sense that Voltaire himself seemed to be enjoying the cruelty more than anything else. Voltaire it is true has an honored place in the human struggle for freedom of individual expression but he was on the personal level a quite terrible person. And that feeling that for him the cruelties of life are a bit of a delight did not escape me when reading the work.<br /><br />This to my mind means that the work cannot even come close to those peaks of world literature in which we have deep connection with and sympathy for the major heroes. Candide is a straw- figure and this little moral allegory still speaks a truth and a question.	2004-11-16

Close to the end of the work he makes this observation \\"..tragedy is that form of art which requires the intolerable burden of God's presence. It is now dead because His shadow no longer falls upon us as it fell on Agamemnon or Macbeth or Athalie. \\"  Steiner then goes on to talk briefly about the possibility of renewal of tragedy under different circumstances.<br /><br />This work is a stellar piece of literary criticism- whether one takes issue with Steiner and believes Job on the one hand , and Willy Loman in another way , are tragic characters after all.	2004-11-14

This sonnet could have been just a grumble about failure and sterility, or a bitter poem about those who seemed happier,more careless and more successful from himself. But the passage from Jeremiah, and the allusions to his own dedication and to God the righteous judge, raise the poem and give it the status of a theological problem as well as a private dilemna. The word which occurs twice in line 3 is the word ' why':it is a cry which has been made by many suffering servants from Jeremiah until now, a cry which is a question from a fallen world. And if Hopkins later poems can be said to have anything in the way of a meaning which underpins them. It can be seen to be an acute awareness of his own others' unhappiness.He rescues moments, attitudes, pictures, places from this( a boy bugler taking communion,a man ploughing, a stream tumbling over rocks), but the note steadily deepens as Hopkins becomes more and more aware of the unhappiness of the world (or the transience of happiness)in his own experience\\".	2004-11-14

Indeed the four stories of this volume- 'Family Happiness' \\" The Death of Ivan Ilyich' 'The Kreutzer Sonata' and 'Master and Man' written in 1859, 1886, 1889, and 1895 respectively -quite clearly reveal these four fundamental traits of Tolstoy's character as well as the underlying motif of his writings during the first great creative period of his life, culminating in 'Anna Karenina', and the motifs of his later period when the' Calvinist and fantic' all but submerged the ' poet and the aristocrat'. The chief theme of his life work is summed up in the sentence that occurs several times in ' Family Happiness': \\"The only certain happiness in life is to live for others.\\"<br /><br />This theme certainly is at the center of Ivan Ilyich who at the end of his life comes to the great understanding that in living for himself alone , not even for his family , his life has been meaningless.<br /><br />The reader of these stories will see how one of the world's great masters confronts fundamental questions of human existence.	2004-11-14

There are six essays whose topics are:Adam and Eve- Marriage, The Redemption of the Sexual Life- Parenthood, Natural and Redeemed- Kibbud u-Mora Honor and Fear of Parents-  Torah and Shekhinah.<br /><br />Here is a sample passage:<br /><br />\\" The Bible often mentions love in conjunction with the act of entering into matrimony. Yet, to confine the essence of marriage to love would be tantamount to building a magnificent edifice upon quicksand. First, as we mentioned before, it is impossible to determine the genuineness and depth of the love feeling. Many times the latter expresses merely a surface transient emotion which is due to physical attraction. Second, no one can predict how long love will endure. The permenency of emotion, no matter how sincere and truthful , is always doubtful. Third, love can be given to many. It is not necessarily limited to one person.That is why Halakah used as its base of operation not the subjective feeling  of marital love, but the objective awareness of marital committment. The latter expresses itself in the reaching of a covenental arrangement between two individuals who, desirous of forming a community, commit themselves to each other.\\"<br /><br />To be able to read and learn from the work of Rabbi Soloveitchik is a great privilege.

Clearly, the belief that He is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe, Who revealed His Law to Israel at Mt.Sinai , has profound practical implications for the Jew and for all humanity. That man is accountable to God for hjis deeds and that he is expected to realize a spiritual purpose in life transform him from a highly developed animal into a transcendental being.

In \\"The Hungry Soul' Leon Kass gives a phenomenological and philosophical basis to the thesis that in eating we can also perfect our nature. Kass is not simply one of the world's senior bioethicists, but a humanist scholar with a medical and scientific background that give his arguments  a force in fact and reason. I cannot honestly say I followed the argument of this work throughout but I did understand through it how eating can become a central means of extending our own caring for, and relation to other human beings, a way then of sanctifying ourselves in the world.<br /><br />I conclude with an illuminating paragraph from Kass' conclusion, a paragraph which I believe gives the true ' flavor ' of the book.<br /><br /> \\"In the higher animals., the soul energized by hunger gains hunger's satisfaction only through intermediate activities- such as smelling, hearing, seeing, chasing, attacking, capturing, biting, tasting, chewing , and swallowing- activities which themselves become new objects for the hungry soul. Increasingly capable of genuine encounters with the world, with other living forms, and ( especially in birds and mammals) with kith and kin,the souls of the hungry acquire new hungers of their own,and for more nourishment.With the rise of intelligence and especially with the extraordinary development of the upright animal, the hungry soul seeks satisfacgtion in activities animated also by wonder,ambition,affection, curiosity, and awe.

His political ideas also took the shape of recognizing conflicting value systems as having validity even when those came from within a single person. Here he writes about the great Russian social and political thinkers Tolstoy, Herzen,Belinsky , Bakunin , Turgenev  with characteristic insight, irony and sympathy.<br /><br />This is a volume anyone interested in the history of ideas should not miss.	2004-11-11

However Masters version of this is a particularly difficult and depressing one, as the frame device involves each character telling his story from the graveyard. There is no ' they all lived happily after' or no ' happy ending ' here. The bitterness, pain , failure frustration of many of these lives makes the whole work extremely for me anyway difficult to get through. Nonetheless there is a lot one can learn about small town Midwest American life, about its conflicts and passions from this volume. The poetry however as poetry is not at the highest level, the level where the language itself means more to us than any  one reading can give. This seems to me in a certain way  more valuable as a  social document than as Literature.	2004-11-11

Harold Bloom has not desisted in reading and rereading the great works of Western Literature, and in so doing advocating to his readers that they too live in the 'enhanced consciousness' which great Literature gives.

None of us Bloom laments will be able to read all the great and good books which have been written- and none of us will be able to reread as we could the great works already read by us, works which in some sense demand endless rereading- but each of us can be free to undertake the work and so far as possible know the joy and the difficulty , the pleasure and the insight , the sense of enhanced life, the love of meeting others and better knowing ourselves, which reading Literature gives.<br /><br />Thank you Harold Bloom for enhancing our world with your exalted love of literature.

It would be followed years later by the author's major work describing that Gulga Archipalego in great detail. This work tells the story of one day in the life of a prisoner. But that one day in its dreariness and monotony, in its small battles for survival, tells the story of a whole world. The cold, the hunger, the sickness, the pain all are parts of the struggle. But the struggle with the world without, the oppression of the world without are only part of the prisoner's struggle. The struggle within himself in which he finds a kind of freedom which no one outside can take from him, is another theme of the play. The person who others might think of as least free is free in his soul. This is one of the great themes of Russian prison literature from Dostoevsky to Solzhenitzyn. This work asks the question of what true freedom is , and what the real meaning of our life and struggle is. It also historically is a step in and toward the demise of that vast prison called the Soviet Union. This is both a work of true literature then and an important historical document.	2004-11-10

He defines the sense of meaningless which has come to a Mankind which feels itself alone in an indifferent Cosmos. He sees that there has been a disintegration of traditional value systems. This sickness he sees as having also invaded traditional Judaism.He strives to understand how Judaism can provide meaning in a variety of areas of life, including in sexual ethics, in the place of the woman in society,in the state of Israel. He argues that there needs to be a new Jewish revival of spirit. He  says that this should involve a Jewish movement toward combining religious and secular learning. He says that the Jewish world must find its meaning in greater unity, greater mutual caring and concern. He concludes the work as follows:<br /><br />\\"Contemplating the dangers besetting all Israel, the threats to our very survival- not at all unlike those in the days of Nazism-how can we think of facing the challenges of the hour without the strongest possible unity of all Israel, without the highest grade of responsibility toward Klal Yisrael, without being carried forward by the deepest sense of Ahavat Yisrael?  How can we do it without realizing that Bein kakh uvein kakh , either way, such are the Jews God has still left; that either way, they are the only brothers and sisters still left us, upon whom alone we may count and who count on us!\\"<br /><br />Rabbi Berkovits wrote these words nearly thirty years ago at the time of the Yom Kippur War. They of course apply today when Israel and the Jewish people are encountering a new evil combination of anti- Semitism from extreme left and Islamic fundamentalist right.<br /><br />This is a book that speaks to the Jewish crisis even today.	2004-11-10

The author has done a tremendous amount of work , has brought together material from a great number of fields , has made a heroic attempt at surveying the whole intellectual development of the twentieth century. His focus is on scientific and technological development, and he believes the century is one in which science ' colonized all modes of thought and changed the way thinking is done\\". According to the book jacket he sees the first half of the century as the period of discovery and the last half as one of synthesis analysis and understanding\\" I wonder however how this fits with the following developments in the second half of the century i.e.DNA's structure revealed by Crick - Watson , the human genome spelled out, the accelerated development of computer technology,  the development of the Internet. I too believe that it is impossible to talk about the overall intellectual history of the century without relating to developments in religious thought. One interesting development in this regard is the movement within the scientific world itself to an understanding of where ' limits' may have been reached and religious thought of possible value.<br /><br />I am not doing justice to the richness of Watson's work, the vast amount of information he brings, the vast number of developments and persons he surveys. One can learn a great deal from this book.<br /><br />When younger I would have tried to ' know the whole book' put it all in my mind. But older if not wiser I understand that in so many cases the ' interpretative description given by Watson ' is preliminary and alternative only. And that there are other ways of describing, understanding the same phenomenom. On the whole I did not come away from this work with a sense of ' understanding the modern mind' in an even a fairly complete way .There is too much, and the central developments are still in the process of being made. In this sense I believe a more modest title to the book such as \\" One man's effort to comprehend the Modern Mind' might have been more appealing and more convincing.developments are still in the process of being made.

Many of these stories are set in Safed in the time immediately after the expulsion from Spain in 1492. The idealized character of the Ari, Rabbi Isaac Luria is at the center of a number of narratives. The narratives though working to enforce traditional Jewish virtues, and to augment the piety of ordinary Jews, also have hidden mystical meaning. Rabbi Wineman in titling the work ' Beyond Appearances' suggests that the true meaning of things is deeper than what is on the surface. In his informative introduction he explains that  the Hasid the devout if unlearned person is revealed in these stories as especially close to G-d.<br /><br />And this suggests \\"There is no person who might not have a crucial influence in transforming the world around him. So too with deeds. None is so insignificant as to not have its influence.In terms of the ideology of the Lurianic Kabbalah a human deed can either promote renewed wholeness or prolonged and more aggravating exile. The enormous significance of the smallest deed, explains according to Rabbi Wineman the tension and anxiety in the stories. For any small error has cosmic effect, and any true act of repentance can help bring about a 'tikkun ' or fixing of the world.<br /><br />The stories fall into three types, legends which deal with historical figures like the Ari, moral tales which tell the story of a ' type' and parables which use a worldly setting to make a spiritual point.<br /><br />The stories are original , surprising and while aiming at reenforcing traditional Jewish virtues such as charity and compassion provide the pleasure that only outstanding Literature can.	2004-11-09

It is written by a Hasidic philosopher- poet. It is a work of reflections and these reflections require commentary. I would not say that I understand the work, but I do say that in the presence of this kind of writing one feels a certain holiness. I think the best way to demonstrate this is by citing one passage. It is from the section ' In the Presence of God'\\" The pious man is possessed by his awareness of the presence and nearness of God.Everywhere and at all times he lives in His sight, whether he remains always heedful of His proximity or not. He feels embraced by God's mercy as by a vast encircling space. Awareness of God  is as close to him as the beating of his own heart, often deep and calm but at times, overwhelming, intoxicating, setting the soul afire\\"<br /><br />Clearly Heschel the grandson of the Atper Rav (The Lover of Israel) was such a soul on fire with the presence of God. \\" May that fire warm and light the way to those of us not as close, not as sure but still striving to come closer to G-d.	2004-11-09

It made a great impression on me then. One of Fromm's points is that we cannot really love others unless we love ourselves. This went against the notion I had at the time that ' self- love' meant ' selfishness only, and that one had to choose between loving oneself and loving another. I think Fromm's point here is a deep and true one.<br /><br />Another important point Fromm made is connecting love with responsibility, care and concern. In other words as a young person there was a tendency to think that love is simply a ' romantic feeling' Fromm broadened the conception of ' love' I had. And this too through indicating that there are different kinds of love, depending upon the kind of relationship it is.<br /><br />Fromm also, and this is another important point gave the sense that it is ' right to love' and that ' love is not a sin'. He gave a sense that love is an essential part of a meaningful life, and something each and every one of us is capable of.<br /><br />His connecting love with truly understanding and caring for ' the other' is another major point. So instead of the instinctually driven, fundamentally sinful view of Man given by Fromm's teacher Freud , Fromm presents us with a fundamentally positive view of human nature and its capacities. This is an especially wonderful book for young people. It can give hope and strength to help them make better lives for themselves and those they love and are loved by.	2004-11-09

It is a very interesting book. The whole business of exploring alternative paths of life for different characters, of understanding that each of us might have had another life, a counterlife is interesting. One however negative effect of this is that it makes the reader understand the character as something less than real, as a toy, a game being played. Nonetheless Roth plays the game with great skill and verbal magic. And he is especially good at showing us the troubles and tribulations of middle age or late middle age. I found also his consideration of the Jewish situation quite interesting, and his arguing for the superiority of the Diaspora to life in Israel a true provocation. For as one who has lived in Israel for years and believes it to be not only the only Jewish state but the one place in the world where Jews are making their communal history I was in some sense angered and offended by Roth's parodying of ' the settlers' and Jewish nationalism in general. Yet while I was offended by what to my mind is a superficial reading of Jewish history and Israeli reality I could not help laughing at certain sections of the book carried off with a comic brilliance which so far as I know is unequalled by any writer today.	2004-11-08

This action , the action of withdrawal and the ensuing revelation have served as inspiration and example for many others overwhelmed by  the burdens and business of life. Thoreau however was not an ordinary person in withdrawal. He was a very deep student of Nature and of the philosophical literature of his Time, of Emerson. And he was in tune with the Transcendental spirit of that time that reaching out and beyond to a spiritual reality which in some way would unite all worlds and bring the universal unity of Mankind. The combination of his deep perception of the local physical world and the vast stretch of his richly metaphoric mind help make one of the great American classics.<br /><br />This work is so aphoristically rich that it is difficult to read it as simple consecutive prose. As with Emerson one must pause and rethink the various aphorisms given us.

Emerson is a philosophical and poetic thinker. This means his poetry is often philosophical and his philosophy as expressed in his essays often poetical. He is in one sense the quintessential American philosopher whose message is an optimistic and life- affirming one. He too is American in calling for a kind of human self- reliance and affirmation. And here it must be remembered that the controversial American moved away from Trinitarian Christianity to be a Unitarian whose sense of the Divinity was both Transcendental and Immanent. It is no accident that he is the great father- figure who hails Whitman's arrival on the scene for they both were capable of seeing in everyday life realities signs of the Divine. Emerson is not however the simple optimist one misreading makes him, but a person who knew deep personal tragedies and had a sense of difficulties of life. He does however believe in human powers and greatness, and he does speak primarily in terms of affirmation. He stands in a way at the center of much of American and even European thought, for it is difficult to think of either William James or Neitzsche without Emerson.<br /><br />I cannot say that he has been a central figure in my life, but I have from time to time through his writings felt illumination and beauty, ' glad to the brink of fear' .	2004-11-08

I do not really understand how scientists work. I read this book, and its major idea seemed to me important i.e. that at a certain time, the traditional way of understanding the world, and the traditional methods for working in it in some particular area of science, yield only contradictions and confusions. The ' model' or ' paradigm' the system of beliefs and practices which those working in the area share proves inadequate. And it is impossible to move ahead, or even simply get out of being stuck through use of the traditional paradigm. So in its place comes the ' revolutionary new paradigm ' which transforms the way the problems are seen, introduces new problems, new methods, and gets scientists working again. Science moves from ' paradigm' to ' paradigm' and one question is of course whether this is in direction of greater approximation to truth, or in no direction at all. I and I think most scientists would like to believe the former is the case, and the new models are closer approximations to the ' truth'which perhaps may never be reached.<br /><br />I believe the idea is a very interesting one, and certainly has proven to be a productive and controversial one. I was also surprised by Kuhn's reporting that the great majority of scientists do 'normal science' which is to say work within the established paradigm in which they check results, go over old tests etc.<br /><br />One additional and great question is whether or not the idea of paradigm shift can be used in relation to other areas of human study , especially those related to ' periodization' in humanities and social sciences. I would I believe take the common sense position that the ' progress from paradigm to paradigm ' toward greater approximation of truth is probably more relevant in the scientific realms than in the humanities.<br /><br />I will leave the real scientific debates to those qualified to have them.<br /><br />For the general reader this is a highly interesting and thought- provoking work.work.	2004-11-08

But more than this she is a thinker who attempts to understand the human situation in all its fundamental aspects. Her analysis of the Human Condition is at once a historical and a philosophical work which aims to speak to and describe the contemporary condition of mankind. One important element in the work is her etymological readings of fundamental philosophical concepts. Her tracing of their development and explanations of reality in terms of them is one of the great strengths of the book. Arendt in analyzing these concepts and in describing the human condition shows herself to have both a powerful skill in argument and in narrative.<br /><br />The basic three- part division between the life of labor, of production, and of action informs her analysis throughout. She attempts to understand the transformations in the condition of mankind through these categories. And one of her great themes is her sense of the decline of the public realm, the realm where action takes place. Her analysis of the problem is by the way far more convincing than her brief suggestion of a possible answer at the end of the book.<br /><br />I have really said almost nothing in this review about this tremendously insightful and rich work. The reader who wishes to stay with it will learn a whole new vocabulary for understanding the world. Whether the reader agrees with each and every point of Arendt's analysis is not the major question. When you are in her presence you are in the presence of a mind that uplifts and exalts, that makes you sense the world of the mind is a higher realm.<br /><br />I believe for the ' person for whom ' thought ' is important this can be a very valuable work.	2004-11-08

It in the beginning swept me up, and I felt myself going through a true reading and intellectual adventure. Elisha Ben Abuya (Acher) the one who entered the Pardess of Jewish Mystical learning and came out a heretic, seemed at first a heroic and tragic figure of great intellectual courage. But as I read on, and the number of his involvements and adventures increased and as I began to wait for counter- arguments to his lack of faith, I began to lose patience .And in time I also began to lose sympathy . And this because I had the sense that Elisha Ben Abuya ' lost it' in a deeper sense than losing his ' faith' I had the sense he lost something even more fundamental in Judaism his goodness and kindness to other human beings. In other words the harassed and persecuted intellectually Elisha ben Abuya should it seems to me have found a way to ' care more for those he hurt and damaged in his own community and people' In this sense as I read he turned in my mind and heart more and more from being a hero to being a betrayer.<br /><br />And in time I lost patience with him .And instead of the book connecting me more strongly with the Jewish Tradition as I had hoped it left me with the sadness of abandonment.<br /><br />My own personal reading may not be the right one, but as great as was the hope in beginning the work so the disappointment in reading to its end.	2004-11-07

There was a sense of learning and understanding the latest picture of the universe the best minds of mankind had been able to put together.<br /><br />I remember regretting it when I missed an episode.<br /><br />I believe I read the book when it first came out. A couple of reviewers have indicated that some of the science is a bit dated, superseded by developments in fields in which new discoveries are happening all the time.<br /><br />Nonetheless at the very same time I was so enthusiastic about Sagan's presentation I did feel a certain reservation. It is the reservation of one or two other reviewers I have seen on this site. For Sagan the Cosmos begins with an absence of Intelligence and moves toward greater and greater Intelligence and Understanding with the development of Mankind. For many of us this picture is questionable , for we hold with the idea of  a Creator not simply at the Beginning of the Process but throughhout. Sagan and I suspect many who read this will say simply ' unverifiable' and ' non-falsifiable' and therefore non- scientific.' I would counter with something like this. That there is a kind of false hope presented in the story if we make it seems as if the place we have in the Cosmos is one of ever- increasing power, knowledge, understanding. The truth is that the vast worlds opened to us by our new knowledge and scientific instruments are vast worlds largely of dust and emptiness. And that the vast stretches of time too make it seem as if our moment is one small lost one before humanity in some way ceases to exist,either through our own ' Progress'in weapon- making or through some cosmic development we simply have no control over. The picture of mastery and optimism in Sagan's Cosmos I want to say is not borne out by conclusive evidence. Seti or not, ' the silence of the infinite spaces still can cast us into dread' This is not meant to be an anti- scientific diatribe . I too share the sense of wonder and appreciation which comes with the chronicle of developing human understanding of the universe.

Books	5	1	1	N	N	An interesting document	One of the surprises of this book is that the authors had to work so hard to compile it. Most of the people they asked the questions about their Jewish identity to , did not respond. So I suppose that the ones who did are more connected to their Jewish identity. I say suppose because there are quite a few strange answers given here. Variety is wonderful in one way but this book does not give a sense very strongly of a unified Jewish people. It seems to me however that answers which are simply private and talk about what the person's Jewishness can do for them miss the whole point. The real question I believe is how the person's Jewishness relates to their service of God, the Jewish people and mankind as a whole .	2004-11-07

This is the form he masters and he is a master of this form. What does the Hemingway story involve? One , it involves a kind of precise and poetic and simple description. Secondly, it involves a certain style, the famous Hemingway compression and conjunction, a style which certainly has read the King James Bible.Thirdly, it involves a hero .It is Nick Adams a midwestern American coming - of age or some avatar of him in Middle Age. It may involve a test or a moment of loss of faith .There are questions of courage often involved. \\" A Clean Well- Lighted Place' is the story of a Spanish old man who holds himself with dignity against the loneliness of the night and the Nada y Nada at the heart of everything. In \\"Soldier's Home' another disenchanted by war hero, disenchanted of all the big sayings and slogans Krebs in his own moment of truth tells his mother that he does not love her and loves nobody .The Hemingway hero is another element of these stories, the hero often destroyed but not defeated who goes through the defeat with dignity. In Fifty Grand ' the fight story there is as often lurks in the Hemingway story violence, threat , criminality but again a hero for whom some kind of dignified affirmation is necessary. Stories of humanity affirming through grace under pressure their own value against a silent and often hostile society and universe.<br /><br />Perhaps .<br /><br />The stories are certainly far better than my poor description of them. Read them, and read some of the best there are.	2004-11-07

His thesis that the world seems to come to an ' end of ideology'has not really held up in time. We see today a kind of total ideology ' radical Islamic fundamentalism' at the center of conflict throughout the globe. This however does not in my judgment diminish the value or quality of the outstanding individual essays that comprise this volume. One brilliant essay alone on the various Sovietology theories is worth the price of the volume. So many learned analyses were provided to understand the Soviet Union at that time, and so few understood the kind of structural weakness which would lead to its self- disintegration. Bell writes convincingly about diverse problems of the advanced industrial society as it is moving in his understanding from a production to a service economy. The essays written in the fifties often show an excellent understanding of the ' information society ' as it is about to enfold. The  main thesis is that the world has come to an age where the great Ideologies no longer hold sway is as I have said challenged by present reality. However the book itself is so rich in ideas and social understanding that one can nonetheless read it with great profit.	2004-11-07

It called for the creation of a Jewish state as a way of responding to the persecution the Jews suffered in Europe. Herzl was especially influenced by the Dryefuss trial and reasoned that if the Jews could not be accepted in what was then one of the most enlightened and progressive nations of the world then they would never ever really be accepted. Only a Jewish state in their ancient homeland, would enable them to live in dignity again.<br /><br />Herzl's vision was as he prophesied realized just fifty years after the book's publication in 1897 when in November 1947 the UN called for partition of Mandatory Palestine into two states , one Jewish and one Arab. The Arabs refused to accept this, opened a war and the Jewish State was not founded in the way Herzl hoped by peaceful means , but rather on the battlefield.<br /><br />Herzl saw the great need of the Jewish people in his time. He did not necessarily see the shape the state would take. Nor did he understand how difficult the path would be for Israel in the Middle East. The great pain and sadness of it all is that even if the state came as he had predicted in fifty years it did not come soon enough to save the Jews of Europe. Herzl saw the discrimination in Western Europe, and the poverty and oppression Jews faced in Eastern Europe. But his vision did not come soon enough to save the Jews from the horror of the Nazis. Israel has as Herzl hoped ingathered Jews not only from Europe but from close to one hundred nations. It is the only vibrant democracy in the Middle East.<br /><br />This book will be especially instructive for those who wish to compare the ' dream of the Jewish state' with its reality today.	2004-11-07

It opens with the description of Oran and already in the first pages Camus creates a world. The story as it will be told is filled with interesting characters. And it is one of the few novels I can think of that really gives a sense of a collective action and drama of a city perhaps a civilization struggling for its life against the Plague.<br /><br />Camus story has more than one hero. But the principal one Dr. Rieux in his silent devotion and his consistent effort to resist and stem the plague is the major one. His seeming stoicism combined with his courageous activity seem to define for Camus the ideal human stance in the face of a now indifferent and now cruel universe. Camus in this book is providing a parable of how Mankind struggles with Evil. And the Evil some say he is referring to is the evil of Nazism in the second War. But the Evil too can be seen as a kind of general Terror which recurs and recurs in human experience. The story of the book, and this is one of the most powerful things about the book is dramatic. The struggle against the Plague is the community's collective struggle and we follow it in the action of the novel. Camus traces the Plague by tracing its reactions on different characters, including one who profits by the Plague, who is freed of his criminal exceptionalism by it. There are also lovable minor characters such as the would - be - writer who writes over and over again the sentence of his novel. And there is too the Priest Father Paneloux and his effort to use the language of Theology to deal with the Evil he is seeing day by day. All these characters most notably Rieux in his relation to his second wife go through the Plague together .And the story of how it ends and how a certain relief comes to the city present in a way the triumph of the human efforts and at the same time a kind of proof of how Man is simply a toy in the hands of forces beyond his control. The Plague in any case Camus makes clear is not destroyed forever, but is gone for now , and will recur again sometime in the future as Evil continues to recur in human history.<br /><br />My brief summary does not in any way do justice to this remarkable and moving work, written with great restraint and beauty.any case Camus makes clear is not destroyed forever, but is gone for now , and will recur again sometime in the future as Evil continues to recur in human history. <br />My brief summary does not in any way do justice to this remarkable and moving work, written with great restraint and beauty.  <br />	2004-11-07

In the course of this journey he converses with his squire who proves to be as down- to - earth and clever as he is ethereal and illusory. And in their dialogue there is much pleasure for the reader even as one blends with the other and in time Sancho too makes impossible dreams his destiny. Whether these two friends are ILLUSION AND REALITY  , APPEARANCE AND REALITY or whatever categories we understand them in their journey says something profound and amusing to us about our own individual journeys through the world. And we begin to understand ourselves as perhaps as strange and as remarkable as they are.<br /><br />This is one of the great books, one of those which demands reading and rereading.<br /><br />It can be difficult and boring and long- winded and digressive at times, but there are pages and passages which will provide such insight and humor that we will feel our common humanity stronger through them.	2004-11-07

He collects Hasidic hanagot ( customary practices) and considers the way they can enrich one's spiritual life and practice.

He teaches how the Jew can transform his consciousness to greater ' devekut ' clinging to God.<br /><br />This book has been one of the most important in my own life.

The author Abraham Foxman is the head of an organization the Anti- Defamation League that does valuable work in contending with this phenomenom. Foxman in this book describes many of the organization's activities in this regard.<br /><br />The new anti-Semitism is a combination of anti- Semitisms. It is the old right wing Fascist anti- Semitism now embodied in neo- Nazis and their ilk, and it is the Islamic world's anti- Semitism which is a wall to wall hatred of Jews and Israel, and it is also ( and here Foxman fails to be strong enough) the anti- Semitism of the radical extreme left which has turned against the Jewish world . The new anti- Semitism often tries to disguise itself as ' Anti- Zionism' only but as Alan Dershowitz pointed out this is a deception.<br /><br />Foxman's work is admirable by and large. To my mind he places far too much emphasis on Christian anti- Semitism , and does not give credit to the vast number of Christian groups and individuals who are allies of Israel and the Jewish people. He too as I have said under-emphasizes the role of the Left. And this when it is precisely the radical Left which should be confronted more vigorously by the ADL ( and this even when members of this radical left are Jewish.) On the whole however this is a valuable book.	2004-11-06

But the words Martin Gilbert has do describe with historical precision the destruction of the Jews of Europe by the Nazis and their various allies. The book is difficult and painful to read because of the horrible stories it tells. And as one reviewer on Amazon has said this is a record not of one crime but of thousands of crimes done every day, not of one cruelty but of millions of cruelties. One of the features of this historical accounting which may seem to some to disturb the flow of the overall historical narrative but which to me seemed to give tremendous weight and power of the book is the account of individual lives, the stories of those people who actually suffered and went through the Shoah. Naming of names in this way, and telling the stories of the ' little people' seems to me to give the account a human strength that more general accounts lack.<br /><br />This work is as I said very difficult to read because of its painful subject matter. Reading it one certainly learns about ' man's inhumanity to man' the cruelty Mankind is capable of. One learns to know how certain specific peoples seem to display special tendencies for that cruelty. One learns about the worst chapter in all of Jewish history , and of the surviving remnant of it.<br /><br />Who wishes to know and understand the full character of human history must read this book, or one like it.<br /><br />G-d help us all.	2004-11-05

It was published toward the Millenium and hinted that there would be upheavals created by Christian fundamentalists which never occurred. It too systemtically downplayed the degree of destruction which has been done on the Temple Mount by the Islamic controllers of the actual places of prayers in the Mount. It also exaggerated the dangers from ' Jewish extremists' and irresponsibly repeated a libel against the late Chief Rabbi of Israel Shlomo Goren as to his having ordered the destruction of the mosques. Rabbi Goren was in fact involved in for many years working to establish a Jewish place of prayer on the Mount alongside the mosques. He was very aware of the upheaval any damage done to the mosques would cause and as Army Rabbi instituted special regulations to make sure it would not happen. Gorenberg also has a minimal concern for basic Jewish and Christian rights on the Mount He says little about the Islamic intolerance, the destruction of valuable artifacts by the Wafq the Islamic authority in charge of the Mount.<br /><br />This work is not all balanced and does not do justice to its subject.	2004-11-05

And this with the hope of coming to the ' Truth'. I remember Watts book on Zen as clear and appealing if never wholly convincing. And this not because of any defect in Watts but because the fundamental thrust of Zen is different as I understand it from what I as a Jewish religious believer fundamentally understand.<br /><br />Zen does not speak or think about a personal God. It does not speak or think about the Covenant or meeting between God and Man .It has no conception of this kind of personal revelation.<br /><br />In opposite it seems to be teaching us not to look ' for this kind of thing' And to somehow leave aside the individual private and the collective communal selves and flow into the world of Nature and Being indistinguishable. And even this  last phrase is probably wrong for Zen since the speaking about it in this way is again ' categorizing' and ' humanizing' . Zen as I sense Watts presents it wants us to free ourselves from these kinds of aspirations and find our way to an enlightentment which once it is called that is not enlightenment either.<br /><br />\\"When you say it's the wrong way, and when you don't say you don't say , so the way the real way is to say and not say, to not say and say , to not say and not say , to say and say- everyday.\\"<br /><br />The Jewish way is of course to pray three times a day in the very same words other Jews elsewhere and all generations of Jews have prayed\\"<br /><br />I am sorry. I know most of the readers of these reviews on Watts book are seeking to better understand Zen. I don't think I have helped you. I think that what I have said is that I recognize that Watts has written a very good book about Zen, but Zen is simply not my cup of chicken soup.	2004-11-04

Boswell took as his subject, the person called ' the greatest talker the English language has ever known'. He went around with him, goaded him here and there, and allowed him to talk.In return Johnson said countless wise, provocative, interesting, and offensive but above all humorous things. Boswell wrote down these , and also wrote down , or reconstructed conversations of Johnson with his friends. All of this helped make his subject ' alive' to his readers in a way no detailed recording of his every action from minute one of his life to minute zero at the end of his life could. He had the sense and intuition to help bring out what is most interesting in his subject. And so he presents the subject not only in a realistic way but in a sense in a most appealing way. This made Boswell the pioneer in a form of biography , or in one of the techniques of biography which is central to it. Boswell himself with all his much self- regretted dissolution was also an interesting apprentice, a writer too after all who learned from the Master. Johnson is a great and central figure , for many the greatest critic the English language has ever known but he is too an acquaintance and friend of Garrick, Hume others of distinction .Boswell listens to them also .Johnson was something of a curmudgeon a lovable kind of character who in his anger and outbursts amuses us. He was also a moral teacher although apparently he did not give much attention to the stricture regarding the wrongness of needlessly defaming others.Together these two are one of literature's great teams, not equal to the Knight of LeMancha and Sancho but up there on the top.<br /><br />Like all works of genius this work has its fanatical followers and its petty demeanors. It is better in these cases to trust the first .For a work like this enriches our common humanity as all the truly great books do.	2004-11-04

Its influence is great both within philosophy itself and in and through general culture. For Goethe and for Coleridge and for many other pillars of Western Literature its wisdom opens up new depths of literature. Spinoza's role in Western Culture as one who follows Descartes and in some sense leads to what comes next in the Tradition is far different from what his place is in the Jewish tradition. Spinoza was put under herem a form of excommunication and cast out of the organized Jewish community in Amsterdam. Will Durant said that he was the only great philosopher who lived in accordance with his thought and there is the conception of Spinoza as somehow living in the pure realm of his own thought. Despite however his rejection by the established Jewish tradition Spinoza became the great intellectual hero of ' freethinking Jews' and the inspiration of many to this day . Isaac Singer is only the most recent of Jewish cultural figures to be enthralled and obsessed with the spirit of  Spinoza.<br /><br />The 'Ethics' is a difficult work. And it is a work which aims to be rigorous in its logic, a geometry of the moral life. It reasons to an identification of the Infinite with Nature- but that Infinite and this is the heretic Spinoza is not a personal<br /><br />G-d. Spinoza teaches that the human being should master emotion by mind and by seeing all from the ' eye of Eternity ' look upon the life and world with a divine calm. Perhaps it was easier the unmarried , childless Spinoza to attain such calm than it is for most ordinary family people.<br /><br />The Ethics again is a difficult work and one I do not pretend to understand. Reading it one comes across unforgettable sentences solidly constructed and part of the whole edifice Spinoza has built. Those interested and capable of it will find the whole world of ' substance ' and 'modes' and ' attributes ' connecting with each other in one ethical metaphysical picture of ultimate reality. I do not understand the picture nor do I think any longer ' language of that kind' can really give us ' the whole world structure and meaning'.<br /><br />I am saying in a way that this work is very rich and very great, and no doubt more so for those unlike myself who might understand it in a fundamental way.icture of ultimate reality.

This is one of the great Hasidic commentaries on the Torah. Many are those who champion it and find in it the deepest of Torah insights. The Ishbitzer in some ways has a psychological acuity which seems to speak most strongly to those of the present generation. Of course Rav Shlomo Carlebach repeatedly learned from and taught Ishbitz. So too did one of his greatest pupils , the Holy Teacher David Hertzberg whose profound insights into the Ishbitz were part of the Torah given over in his own sefer ' Pri Mayim Chayim' Bezalel Edwards shows a good command of the text. One would like very much however to see this translation printed with the original text alongside, a dual- language volume. Perhaps some enterprising publisher in the world of Judaica could start bringing out such dual- language volumes. Another candidate for this would be the Ishbitzer's great teacher, the Kotzker.Somehow for certain readers anyway the dual- language works add a dimension to our learning which having the text in the language of translation alone does not.<br /><br />But again Yishar Koach to Bezalel Edwards on this excellent work.	2004-11-04

Many of the concerns he has are unique to his own project in writing. His concern with presenting a vast social panorama and being the first cultural influence on society as a whole is in one sense ambitious and admirable, and in another idiotically grandiose. Mailer is always a strange mixture, a mixture of brilliance and absurdity , of great writing with self- indulgent stupidity. Here too there is much mix - up but there is less of the senseless profanity and vulgarity that sometimes made his showmanship, and advertising for himself objectionable. Mailer is a serious craftsman, a hard- worker who has much to say about the technique of writing, especially novel - writing. He seems obsessively concerned with his own place on the literary pantheon, and like Hemingway before him seems to be measuring himself against the competition. Harold Bloom would be happy with this kind of 'Beat old Turgenev but was whipped by Old Tolstoy today stuff' Summing it all up is difficult for him and difficult for his long- time readers also . The great early promise of ' Naked and the Dead' the series of disappointments which followed, the dramatic comeback with the novel as journalism 'Armies of the Night' and the ongoing obsessions with the Great Novel, American Social Justice, the meaning of Manhood, the nature of Criminality and Extreme Behavior, end in some way where it begun in the craftsman considering the craft of writing. Mailer in my poor judgment could have done a little better had he thought more about the meaning of human goodness and kindness even in writing. But he is what he is one of the giants of twentieth century American literature and this book contains enough brilliant paragraphs and passages to prove it.	2004-11-04

I enjoyed reading this book and learning about a form of poetry I sense I will always be far from. I do not know Japanese , and what can 5-7-5 syllabled lines mean to me , when I do not know  what a Japanese syllable is? Still Henderson gives a sense of the importance of the poetic form to Japanese tradition. He gives examples of the poems . And he helps me better understand a form I first encountered in the writings of Salinger where he gives a few examples, and on another occasion describes the poetry of Seymour Glass as a kind of ' double- haiku'. I to tell the truth have always had a certain reservation about this small- suggestive- form , and a sense that the kind of subtlety it hints at does not exactly suit what my soul needs. I can be and have been moved by the 'Nothing in the voice of the cicada intimates how soon it will die' haiku when Salinger or Henderson explains what it means. But the examples I have read not move me deeply the way the Western poetry I most love does. Still thanks to Henderson for helping me learn a bit about another way of making beauty with words.	2004-11-04

As a physician and as a moral philosopher he is uniquely qualified to deal with the issues being raised by the latest biotechnological developments. His concern is to preserve the freedom and dignity of humanity, against the unthinking onslaught of the ' improvements ' that may destroy us.<br /><br />It seems to me that his goal is admirable and his arguments strong, but that the marketplace of technological one up-man-ship and human pride greed and ambition will not prevent many different kinds of ' progress' for a few that will be detrimental to all. Even if Kass were to succeed within the United States in restraining certain kinds of research, there would be no stopping teams of researchers elsewhere who would for profit and glory produce ' designer babies' and ' new forms of machine- man hybrid life' and ' indefinitely long - lifed human beings' and countless other developments which again might seem beneficial for a few but which will be detrimental to our common humanity.<br /><br />Kass is a clear and convincing writer in discussing a whole host of issues in regard to what we may do to ourselves in our laboratory future.

He was the giant and god of twentieth English Literature, the master critic who defined the Tradition and Individual Talent. The 'Wasteland ' was taken to be something like a definitive statement about the whole cultural tradition. The dried- up and dead world , the post First- world War world was the end of what the Tradition gave. And the Tradition brought back in allusions and references , treated ironically was defined and put in its place by the young expatriate bank- clerk whose Pound patron called him the better poet.<br /><br /> Eliot was the writer of many great beautiful poetic lines . And the ' fragments he shored against his ruins were made here into a modern masterpiece. Unfortunately that masterpiece is morally marred by his Anti- Semitism, and of course by the somewhat shallow reading of History which informs the work as a whole . Yet the work did for many define the time , even when Eliot transcended himself and made the high Anglican culture his home, writing himself back in with \\"Four Quartets\\"<br /><br />The allusion, the philosophical and abstract language combined with the precise musical poetry certainly stand in his favor and say that he no doubt is a poet to be reckoned with.<br /><br />Even those of us old enough to know in our bones long lines of his cannot however forget his Beideker and Blustein his own hatred and misperception, preliminary to the Nazi world to come.<br /><br />There are some sins even poetic greatness does not forgive.	2004-11-03

So is it with Julius Caesar .For Ceasar is a most political play in which dear Brutus and his conspirators do find a way on the Ides of March of doing away with great Caesar. But Brutus who as you know is Ceasar's dear friend and in the name of friendship and love of Rome did do great Ceasar away , is taken to task by Ceasar's other mignon dear Anthony who in his mindful  farewell speech does set a standard for political rhetoric all mankind may have its eyes upon .For dear Anthony does let the Roman rabble know how much their Ceasar loved them , and does show how the ambition attributed to him by Brutus is nought but their imagining. And how great Caeasar loves them all. And so he makes not only the good works of Caeasar live after him but turns the general public against those very conspirators. And in this action and in what ensues the war which follows great Brutus too does come to his bitter end defeated by that Antony who allied with Ceasar's true heir makes a general reparation of the wrong . Oh what a wondrous play and what great speeches and immortal words .Think only of this , think only of such words as Antony's ' His life was gentle and the elements so mixed in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world / This was a man.<br /><br />Oh great great play for all who would study the intrigues of Man and hear in great Shakespeare's  declaiming the vanity and folly of all ambition's greatness  while making their play immortal through his words.	2004-11-02

He understands the constant threat from their Arab neighbors under which Israel lives. But he tries to see the situation too with sympathy for the Arab side. His basic line politically is of the left, and he clearly favors political compromise.<br /><br />The book does provide a pretty fair picture of Israeli society.

It is filled with the kind of interesting minor characters Dostoevsky regularly created. It touches upon some of his major themes, including that of  obsession, the striving for repentance, the backsliding, the thrill of sin. It is also the best book about gambling ever written and gives the feeling of how the gambler is so possessed, obsessed by the action loses his rationality and sense completely in the course of it. The well- known psychological theme of the gambler who gambles to lose is also revealed here. And this theme too the masochistic , self- torturing one is part of the story. Also the greed, and those famous character reversals. The cold and commanding destroying woman figure is another theme played out in the story. All this makes for a tremendously absorbing narrative, and one of Dostoevsky's finest works. One reservation has however to be made. Dostoevsky was a great genius but in many ways not a very admirable human being. HIs pathological hatred of Poles and Jews is part of this work, and it is not a literary theme that is to be  taken lightly. The question of when a great genius writes a work flawed morally is one not his alone, but has special force in his work.<br /><br />Of course with this work the life- story also adds to the legend. And his need to write it rapidly in a short term to maintain the rights to his other works, adds to its legend. At white hot pace under the sword of necessity  he created ( as he often did ) a remarkable work of genius.<br /><br />Every genius and his own modus operandi. This was Dostoevsky's.	2004-11-02

She is as would be expected especially strong on Yiddish Literature and her section on Singer is very illuminating. However whether or not she succeeds in truly defining a canon is very questionable. For a canon implies a certain community consensus , and this is really an effort of an individual scholar. I do not think here it is important to quarrel with individual selections, but rather simply to indicate that the exercise as a whole is an academic one, and not a down- to -earth practical realistic one.<br /><br />Another point. The real feel of Kafka or Singer or Bellow or the Ishbitzer or the Kotzker or Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach or any other ' creator ' of modern Jewish literature is given in their writing, and their writing alone. The ' canon' is their work,and not a literary work written about the canon. And another point which my previous examples make. There are vast worlds of Jewish creative  religious literature which certainly should be part of any modern Jewish literary canon. This suggests that the borders of the canon should be much wider than those drawn by Wisse.<br /><br />Her effort thus is a valiant one but in my judgment one of only limited success.	2004-11-02

It is written with this kind of energy and power the same kind of literary ambition that seems uniquely his. Balzac as a writer has a drive and strength , and this is felt in his descriptions of character as well as in the force of his plots. Here we have a variation of Lear, with two ungrateful daughters doing - in the over- solicitous father for whom the daughters are all. One of Balzac's central themes is obsession, the fixing on one particular object as one's life aim or meaning and giving all to it. For old Goriot it is his daughters, as for Balzac himself it is his ambition to capture the whole of his society in his novels. But the Balzac worlds and this in itself another long subject are also worlds in which traditional values are in clash with values of social climbing money grabbers as exemplified by Goriot's daughters. Balzac's works are filled with great dynamism  and are for many one of the great peaks of world - literature. At least some of his works should be read by one who wishes to have a taste of the best that has been thought and said. I would only add my own personal reservation. That the energy and greed of so many of the characters in his world , has left me feeling a bit detached from them. I can admire this Literature but I have never especially loved the world or characters presented in it.	2004-11-02

And yet it too seemed to me to rage in connection with my own father's light. It too seemed to interpret and be interpreted by him. Lear in his great pain driven to madness by grief was like my father a great king wounded into screaming by life. The Lear story , the three daughters , ungrateful Goneril and Regan, and lovely Cordelia true to her troth , loving with the mean and proportion a daughter's love required- that story and the father's dispossession and madness and grief and reconnection with the loving daughter and her death and his grief breaking into madness- that story the story of the tragedy itself- as too the secondary plot with there too a father misapprehending the virtue of one child, and being deceived by another- that plot and the heart of the Lear story did not speak to me at the time. No , just Lear poor bare forked unencumbered man himself this spoke to me .For again in the great language of grief and madness came those metaphors which likened themselves to the kind of thing we heard every night from my father around the kitchen table. So I did not then read Lear truly and wholly, but rather took for myself some part of it which connected with my life.<br /><br />A great work of art is not simply all the readings made of it, and not even all the misreadings made of it, but all the truth it reveals and inspires in us. Again it told my father's story and suggested that story greater than any Literature could perhaps be Literature one day.<br /><br />And this without Cordelia's death and without ' Never, never, never , never, never. Why should a horse a rat have life and her no breath at all? With only a different cry and one for us anyway more painful still ' No, a thousand times no '	2004-11-01

The great Macbeth spurred by the ambition of Lady Macbeth let's ambition turn him to murder , and this murder and its consequences are the heart of the tragic tale. The powerful figure of Lady Macbeth dominates her less strong husband, and he the great warrior follows her toward ruthless realization of his own ambition. The fall of all is the justice of the end of the play. The play contains one of Shakespeare's greatest speeches , the \\"Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow \\" soliloquy of Macbeth .And the work as a whole does raise the question of the meaning of the sound and fury signifying nothing. As a young person reading this work for the first time I could never reconcile myself to the cruel end of the story - I simply could not understand why such a sad and unhappy ending had to happen to them all. For this reason my love of the play as a whole was tempered, though I very much loved its great passages and language. I just could not bear in those days to see such an ' unhappy ending'.	2004-11-01

Or rather my father helped me understand them. All the hesitation and delay and indecision, all the great outpourings of feeling in soliloquy , all the great sense of life as tormenting and impossible and yet somehow great and sublime, all this echoed and reflected from my own childhood family life world back and forth to Hamlet. The great language reaching out to metaphor no ordinary mind could find. This too.<br /><br />Of the plot and the story of the father murdered and the son who needed to revenge and delayed and the mother who betrayed and enticed, this was far far from me. More I loved the language the great speeches even when we were taught that they were ironic and self- condemning (To thine own self be true as triteness not truth) I loved and memorized much of Hamlet's solitary crying , \\" Oh that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew\\" and felt in the pain of Hamlet my father 's pain and poetry. I know for most this is the greatest play ever played, and I know too how down the generations critics have given their own long theories explaining why Hamlet delayed and what the ultimate meaning of the play is. But what each of us is given in his own way is another story. And if I have here said a few private words it certainly will not harm or change very much that vast sea of readings which have accumulated around this work, and which will grow still larger and larger in time. One of the great works unquestionably, one mankind will go on reading and rereading as long as mankind keeps reading. And for me a hint that my father's life and suffering somehow related to a higher world called Literature where it might have its echo, and who knows one day truly find its meaningful expression.	2004-11-01

But is a Bellow more negative and more beaten down than in his previous work Herzog. In Herzog the main character however breaking down was younger, and more connected to some kind of love and hope in life. Here Sammler the survivor is struggling in a more closed and negative world. And his cultural and social comments tend to reflect a greater despair over the urban civilization in decay the New York of the sixties . The more beaten down and broken world of Sammler, an the more difficult personal past make this work in its tone and feeling heavy and difficult to bear. We do not necessarily need the optimism of Augie March or of Henderson to feel Bellow is at his best( In fact my judgment is the best is the more balanced while apparently more cracked Herzog) but here the harsh and negative overwhelm or drown all.<br /><br />Bellow, but not the best Bellow there is.	2004-11-01

But unlike Dostoevsky's ' Underground Man' he does not scream out his 'nay' in curses. His 'nay 'is quiet. \\" I prefer not to\\" . A much more romantic American adolescent naysayer Holden Caulfield will captivate readers also by saying to society, the world, the system of conventions that all are subject to, nay and nay again.<br /><br />The outcast, the loner, the naysayer is of course one great archetypal figure of world and most especially American Literature.<br /><br />Bartleby belongs among them.<br /><br />And the fact that neither he nor the narrator nor the author fully articulate the ' root of his nay' adds in a way to the mystery and mystique of the character.<br /><br />There is it seems to many of us something admirable in those who can turn away from the demands of ordinary society, and listen to the sound of their own drummer.<br /><br />But what is maddening and absurd in Bartleby is that he does not seem to do this for anything special. He gives no hint that this ' nay ' gives him personal satisfaction. His withdrawal seems impersonal .And it seems a reflection  of his own feeling about himself which is ' nay' Or on another interpretation it might be said that his saying ' I prefer not to' is the only way in which he preserves a vestige in his own identity.<br /><br />Clearly there are many ways of reading this. But this is an exemplary  tale, of course enriched by Melville's  descriptions of the office world of the time, by his masterful language and humor.<br /><br />One of the great long - short stories, or if you will, short novels.

No doubt one of the most important was self - promotion .He was the first great American advertising man. And the product was hard- working honest, frugal, modest, virtuous Ben Franklin. His letter to his son is a letter to the world in which he explains and justifies himself. He also provides a kind of ' how- to- do - it ' success guide and is in this way a pioneer, an inventor of this genre also.<br /><br />Franklin tells us how through hard- work, and virtue he rose from nowhere to great prominence. He perhaps does not tell us however enough about the source of his extraordinary inventiveness and energy .<br /><br />The autobiography covers only a certain portion of his life does not include the work of later years including his key role in the American revolution, and his remarkable work as Ambassador .<br /><br />The work is without question an American landmark and classic which for seem really defines the ' American money- making and success- obsessed society' at its best.<br /><br />But the work also deliberately conceals much, and certainly does not touch upon other sides of Franklin including his not very modest behavior with the fair sex. Franklin was a far more complex character than this biography suggests. He in a sense simplified himself to make himself more saleable . So the key to the various mysteries of Franklin's life must be found in other works, not in this one.	2004-10-31

He tells the tale of human life at its end in his own language of musical feeling. It will not exactly cheer you up but will give you the feeling of a very distinct individual creative voice. The question of course is how much of this stuff the person can take. Mailer said of Beckett ' we are not all impotent' but at the age of ninety Malone may be right.<br /><br />I wonder however if there is not another way of thinking about the last time of fading, and suspect that there is. The Jewish idea that the great are informed thirty days before their death of the impending event and can thus prepare and part from their loved ones with dignity, is something to keep in mind as an alternative. \\"When I go we all goes\\" says Joyce Beckett's great teacher , but who knows maybe there is a more honorable way of going in which we think more about those we are leaving behind than we do about our own lonely journey to the next world, or not.	2004-10-31

He is the witness of the most horrible evil in human history , who somehow managed to help make the character of that Evil known to the world. He is a devoted writer and a foremost spokesman and defender of the Jewish people. But he is also has a special role in working to help the suffering and the persecuted throughout the world. Years ago in Biafra he was there to try and help the Ibo. And since then he has time and again placed himself at risk to help others. As a teacher and writer his work bears not only the mark of his poetic and G-d haunted soul, but of his enormous devotion to the good of humanity. This volume picks up the story of his life when at forty he decides to make a more determined effort to help the suffering of humanity. It tells the story of journeys and struggles .Often he is met by opposition but he is fueled by the determination to stand for the suffering. As a truthteller he dared confront the President of the United States over the obscenity of Bitburg . His deeds go before him and his words are a light to mankind.

He sets the tone and the mood so special in Conrad for this tale of the white man's venture into the heart of darkness, the heart which on one level is the civilization or absence of the civilization of the dark continent, and on the other in the deepest sense in the soul of Man himself. For what Mr. Kurtz reveals ultimately is the horrow within himself, perhaps the horror of the evil of the deeds of colonializing civilization, perhaps the evil of the human soul itself stript bare of civilization's restrictions and inhibitions. In any case the tale told by Marlowe is one which does not provide an easy answer, but as in Conrad's best work provides an opportunity for deeper contemplation. And all this done with that pensive and wisely descriptive prose of Conrad which at once lures us, captivates us , imprisons us and makes us long like Kurtz himself in the heart of Africa, to escape from it.	2004-10-31

There is something moving about the care taken by the father to teach his wunderkind son all that he knew. The father was with Jeremy Bentham the guiding spirit of the philosophical movement  Utilitarianism. Utilitarianism was a mechanical kind of philosophy which thought it possible to measure the goodness of action by measuring the amount of pleasure against the amount of pain. Mill followed the path his father set out from him, adopted his father's values and social conscience and was already by the tender age of twenty a distinguished intellectual figure. But then he asked himself the question if the realization of all his social schemes and all the grand social ideals would bring him happiness. And he understood that it would not. He understood in other words that all this focus on outward good and action, on mechanical measures for human life was missing some vital component in life and in himself. Mill went into a great depression. What brought him out was the reading of the poetry of Wordsworth and the understanding that there is a dimension of feeling, a dimension of the inner life which is somehow more important than all the social thought. This did not mean that Mill abandoned the path of social reform but rather that he changed its direction. Part of this change had to do with his meeting his relationship with Harriet Taylor, his embracing in a certain sense of liberal ideas on the role of women in society. Mill found himself and continued on his intellectual path, a path which would lead him to produce one of the masterpieces of modern political thought, \\"On Liberty \\".	2004-10-31

This work is Joyce's finale. It is the logical extension of processes within his work from the earliest writing through Dubliners the Portrait, through Ulysses, and at last 'Finnegan's Wake'. He invents a language of his own , a language of all languages, and expects Mankind to spend ' all the years of the nights' reading it. Aside from his courage, and conviction his great arrogance and literary power this work is the proof of the artist going to the end of what he is with all that he has.<br /><br />And this said in praise- the truth , the basic truth of the unreadibility of the work, of its being rescued for readers by certain lyrical passages, the opening and ending most notably, leaves the work as a secondary one in the Joyce canon. Joyce is Joyce because of Ulysses. Finnegans Wake is the curiosity of his middle old age. The truth is too that the fundamental efforts to make all of history myth, and to find in repetition the answer to our meaning is mistaken historically . And the other great failing is in the punning language itself, the proof positive that in trying to mix up everything into one , one arrives primarily at confusion.<br /><br />Finnegan 's Wake thus stands more as kind of chapter in the literary biography of Joyce than as a literary work of value in itself.

But this work too is a masterpiece which gives us a portrait of an artist in development , and a picture of the society, the church, the family he would go into exile from . Joyce's center is in his consciousness of language, and his creation and recreation of it. He begins the autobiography in the baby language of beginning, and throughout adjusts styles to the situation and level of life he happens to be in. But the fundamental portrait is of the young artist in development, a development of his knowledge and artistic skills but also a development toward knowledge and estrangement from the world which he comes from. He will leave his family, and his native land and his church not so much for the exile of Trieste or Zurich or Paris or any place in particular but for that situation in which he can be wholly alone to shape in the smithy of his soul the uncreated conscience of his race. Joyce master of ironies sees perhaps the vanity of his own vaunted ambition but nonetheless is true to it to the end. This work is filled with remarkable and beautiful passages, interesting meetings and in a way memorable characters. It opens us to a new world the world of a great artist whose epiphanies on oval leaves will tell of the great transformation and development of his life- in which the spiritual realm is no longer the Catholic and conventionally religious but is usurpred by the great truth telling and beauty- creating realm of Literature. This work is in parts difficult to read, but even if with the help of some kind of crib it should be ventured . For it is a great work indeed.	2004-10-31

It contains selections from the fourteen volumes of poetry she had published prior to it. Feinstein is also a well- known biographer, and translator who helped bring the work of the Russian poets Akhmatova and Tsevetayava to public notice in the West.<br /><br />She writes movingly of her father , of her academic husband and of her children. She writes of the various worlds she knows .She writes of people with insight and real feeling and sympathy. She is an understandable poet and one whose richness of language does not lose itself in obscurity or hidden meanings. She also has an inquisitive questioning mind not only about the world and the people she meets but about herself and her own life. It was a great pleasure to read these poems .

I will say however that I believe all of James worth reading and considering , whether one agrees with him or not.<br /><br />And this when I believe I am not alone in saying his greatest work is ' The Varieties of Religious Experience' and if I were to choose one James' work it would be that one.<br /><br />I only want to make one point about ' the Will to Believe'. And that is I believe that James very rational approach to religious belief, his recommendation that we make a choice, his conception that the ' will' is at the heart of it misses most religious experience as I know it. My own sense that is that it is out of deep need, and often an inner compulsion that pewople choose the religious option. It is not a matter of ' will' at all. And the recommendation to make the ' will ' primary will only appeal to a small minority. So I think that his whole approach is somehow mistaken. Religious believers do not come into the world generally through will and decision of the kind he recommends.	2004-10-30

Chaucer never completes this plan but he does in the prologue give us wonderful character sketches of everyone from the ideally virtuous Knight to the scandalous Wife of Bath .

The Prologue is filled with humor and piety, with sacrasm and wit, with beauty of language and harsh social criticism.<br /><br />It is the microcosm of the whole set of Tales which are to come.

I do not like it very much.<br />Camus could write of life's absurdity in a beautiful way. Sartre writes of the vague repulsion his Roquentin feels toward his existence and everyone else's without the same kind of literary and aesthetic appeal.<br />He is overwhelmed by his sense of life 's contingency. Nothing need be as it is .<br />This means he sees himself as superflous.<br />Along the way he meets someone called the 'Self- Made Man' who has a positive approach to life, believes in the idea that through action one can make meaning. Roquentin listens intently to him but at a certain point feels 'nausea' again, the same nausea which he felt at the outset of the novel when first touching a wet- pebble.<br />This is one way of feeling and seeing the world, but life and literature are filled with many others more humanly interesting and meaningful.<br />Even loneliness and boredom can be better than this.	2004-10-29

It becomes too something others can recognize and admire as a true way of being. It becomes the absurd hero in an indifferent world whose life and action have a kind of detached mystique and beauty.<br /><br />By every sign the one true feeling Camus shows in this work is his admiration for beautiful prose.	2004-10-29

He is the author of a number of outstanding popular Judaica works including his writings on the stories of the Sages. He was a tremendously dedicated Jew a great master of what he himself called ' shulmanship'. He was also a Shaliach HaTsibbur b' Chesed, and in the last years of his life when very very ill his leading of the Service at Neilah at Yom Kippur was a most deeply moving religious experience.<br /><br />In this short autobiography he tells of his childhood in Liverpool and his moving toward a life in the Rabbinate. A key turning point and the greatest blessing of his life was his meeting  with the former Anita Newman who became his wife lifelong helpmate and Eshet Chayil . Together as a young couple they directed programs for Jewish refugee children from Nazi Germany .They lived later in Riverdale in New York and for the last fifteen years of the Rabbi's life in Jerusalem. Rabbi Pearl originally an Orthodox Rabbi became a leading Conservative thinker after his move to the United States. And was a leader of the Masorati movement in Israel.<br /><br />This work is written as Rabbi Pearl wrote with great clarity and consideration for the reader. It is only a short part of the life of a truly remarkable Jew and human being.

If you can read and understand this work then you are a better reader than I.<br /><br />I slogged through great parts of it years ago, and at some point was totally eliminated by the paradoxical obfuscations.<br /><br />Nonetheless, a few major points did emerge either from the reading of this , or the reading of other works on or about Sartre.<br /><br />Sartre sees human beings as thrown into the world. Born as nothing they, or we have to create through their own actions their identity or being. One big question for Sartre is whether this is done with authenticity , or false consciousness but I do not really understand what ' being true to oneself' or ' being authentic ' means in his terms.<br /><br />The picture of Man alone in the Universe without God struggling to create an identity and being presents Mankind in a certain sense in a heroic light. We are the sole meaning- makers of the Universe trying to fashion our meaning out of nothing.<br /><br />But what we do all in the end goes back to nothing. So it is from Nothingness to Being and back to Nothingness again. The rock rolls down the hill and at some point Sisyphus cannot push it up again. And nada is nada is nada our nada in nada.<br /><br />Now that is one way of looking at the world, a way which I understand as understandable, but it seems to me unsatisfactory ultimately.<br /><br />The answer many others would argue - and it is not in this book- is in precisely the area Sartre most rejects, the religious. The belief in God and the creation of our own life and work in cooperation with  God. But this is of course not the message that Sartre accepts.	2004-10-29

The story of the Compson family in decline is narrated in the consciousnesses of three members of the family, the idiot Benjy, the dreaming time- haunted and honor - haunted Quentin, the practical wily, resentful business - son Jason. And the story concludes with Faulkner's great epilogue in which he tells us more of Dilsey the black- mother- substitute center who holds the family together. The decline of the South and the rise of a new industrial society is one central theme, as is the relation of blacks and whites in the old South. But more than this this is the story of the human heart in conflict with itself, of a family driven by lust and ambition and greed and all the basic human feelings. And the story is told with the power of Faulkner's self- invented Latinate stream- of - consciousness prose meaning that whatever he learned from Joyce he took it into himself and made it into a rambling record of a magnificent mind's disquistions on the neverending and yet ending paradoxical and impossible lust of poor Quentin for Caddy and for the sheer senseless sounding on a golf course of an idiot hit- hit  and the manipulations of a finagling brother robbed and all in all though it may seem to be confusion its not that at all because ultimately in control of all the master Faulkner makes us understand that it is a tale and it is at least in part told by an idiot and it is certainly full of sound and fury and it does of course signify nothing though in this very work by its greatness that nothing too is made not and in the end who knows it may after all signifiy the light of American literature as it turns and turns from 1928 on to the lesser works more urban works perhaps in some way more meaningful works which will come after and by others.

As with Faulkner always there is the ongoing romance with the neverstopping prose which keeps the reader moving on and on as if the reading itself were one great adventure story and Faulkner had himself invented a technique so powerful as to be the rightful legacy of all writers who wished to enrapture their readers with a poetic philosophical or pseudo- philosophical prose which never stops entertaining us with new descriptions and feelings, as if too then the others, the preacher and the do- gooder and the whole book itself were telling us that this literature is redeemed only as itself and not as any social message it gives but in the life of its characters and in its language which in Faulkner is always great. And I here must apologize and say that there are a few very good reviews on this book on Amazon written before this one which tell far more about the work than this one and might be better read in helping to understand it.	2004-10-28

It is his best piece of longer fiction. His best work is his stories. When he goes on too much he gets to the bull, and the bull is often too much bull for what he really has to say.<br /><br />This is too the quintessential Hemingway. Jake Barnes is the wounded Hemingway hero who must act with the silence and dignity and not show his feelings'.He must not be  like  the Jewish Robert Cohn middleweight boxing champion of Princeton(Hemingway here displays the polite Anti- Semitism so common to his class in that time. Fitzgerald does the same in Meyer Wolfsheim world series scene in 'Gatsby')  who cries and is sentimental, and thus violates the Hemingway code. \\"Grace under pressure\\" means admiring the bullighter who under pressure acts with the grace of minimum motion .It means for the code hero Barnes living his life with the same kind of emotional economy that the model bullfighter, sports hero , simple man of action does.<br /><br />The whole Hemingway myth of heroism is in this work  including the beautiful aristocratic  rich bitch Brett Ashley whose impossible love with Barnes is the ' romantic story heart ' of the work.<br /><br />My generation was raised to think of the Hemingway-twenties expatriate people as heroic forebearers. They seem to me now in the distance of time spoiled party-goers redeemed only by the masterful prose and perception of their creator. Hemingway read the Bible and out of it made a simple style of conjunctions. He made out of it a way of seeing and describing all his own. In doing this he did what most writers hope to do, and only a few can.<br /><br />Hem could really write, and he could really describe with a kind of poetic intensity the details of the world he was perceiving. Despite my great admiration for the Nick Adams' stories, and my sympathy for the ' wounded Hemingway hero ' and my love of a number of other great Hemingway stories I simply find the ' myth ' and the Hemingway hero , an artificial construction contradicted not only by the author's famous boasting and bragging within the work and without, but by the much more complex world of living real characters American expatriate, or not.ficial construction contradicted not only by the author's famous boasting and bragging within the work and without, but by the much more complex world of living real characters American expatriate, or not.	2004-10-28

It provides information and insight into Jewish communities such as the one in the Ukraine or the one in Dublin, Ireland which receive scant attention. However its writing is stronger than its central thesis i.e. that Judaism in the Diaspora is strongly reviving and that it now is on a par with Israel as ' center' of the Jewish people. Anyone who knows the elementary demographic data on the assimilating and aging Jewish diaspora knows that this thesis is based on looking at an important minority element in the community . i.e. those Jews who care more now than before about their connection with Judaism, especially the more religious Jews. Moreover in simple theological terms it is either ignorance or heresy to put the Diaspora on the level of Israel. Israel is in Jewish religious terms the place where one can best serve G-d. And in terms of Jewish national life, and any semblance of an independent Jewish community and world it is the single center we have .<br /><br />The book again is very well written and provides interesting insights into a number of Diaspora families and communities.	2004-10-28

The great memorable lines of the opening , ' It is an ancient mariner / and he stoppeth one of three/ by the long grey beard and thy glittering eye / wherefore thou stoppest thou me?/ lead us to a kind of enchanted and impossible world. The tale itself of the slaying of the albatross of the cosmic coordination in response to the evil of Man has a certain Biblical flavor which connects the story with Jonah . The work as a whole I have always found perplexing in its ultimate meaning, but strong in its great poetic lines. (Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink)<br /><br />In another great poem in this collection ' In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree ' Coleridge 's great musical power and mystical sense is again felt .This scattered man of ideas this long- suffering lonely genius the incredible master of the mind's digression, this supreme talker and goer- on- and -on did in his youth also write great poetry .<br /><br />There is much much beauty here amid the musings and meanderings of this great wandering and wondering mind.	2004-10-28

Adolescent innocence contradicted	I have just read a good share of the reviewers of this book on ' Amazon'. They almost without exception speak of it as one of the best, most realistic books that they have ever read.<br /><br />I remember first reading it many many years ago in high - school. Of course one of the book points of interest for a young person of that age was the ' man- woman stuff' which seemed to me at the time interesting and somehow troubling. In my innocence I thought that the way it works is, that a man and woman fall in love , and they ' do it' and then live happily ever after. I could not quite understand the famous words of Prew ' I love every woman I ever ......'<br /><br />Along with this part of it another adolescent myth was very much in my mind at the time. A man is tough , and he beats up everybody else , and he is not afraid, and he can really fight and no one can make him afraid. Against this myth which I myself was worried about not measuring up to came the complex reality of Prew standing up to the establishment which wanted to break him. Here too my Innocence was being contradicted. I naturally thought that if people ran the Army then they must be good, and want above all what is good for the Country, and is good for its citizens. All this business about petty- infighting, and people stabbing others in the back for their own interest, also troubled me.<br /><br />Yet with all the troubling the book at that time did provide a kind of education in worlds I did not know. And it did have very interesting characters and situations . But again much of the behavior in it ( the drunken stuff especially) confused me because it was presented as ' something to be admired' while for me it was alien.<br /><br />In other words for me in reading the book then there was a lack of sufficient confidence in and awareness of my ' real self' which would have enabled me to simply not be disturbed by ' models of behavior' outside my interest and frame of reference.<br /><br />And this said I would again point to the virtues of the book, its realistic depiction of the Army world, its capturing of the American mentality and life of its time, its portrayal of interesting individual characters, its celebration of individualism , its awareness of the complexity of human situations, and the impossible conflicts people often are placed in, its awareness of divided loyalties, , its managing to be the best book coming after the Second World War about the Second World War while primarily being about the Army before the War.to the virtues of the book, its realistic depiction of the Army world, its capturing of the American mentality and life of its time, its portrayal of interesting individual characters, its celebration of individualism , its awareness of the complexity of human situations, and the impossible conflicts people often are placed in, its awareness of divided loyalties, , its managing to be the best book coming after the Second World War about the Second World War while primarily being about the Army before the War.  <br />	2004-10-28

He bends over backwards to be ' objective' and in the process distorts reality . He has a visceral dislike for the Jews who live in Judaea and Samaria and cannot write of them with sympathy. He is one of those who argues a ' false symmetry' between the Palestinians who advocate terror, and the Israelis whose military action is in self- defense. He pretends to be fair, but lacks real judgment and the courage to see that one side in the Middle East conflict is far more right than the other. In this he is the perfect representative of the paper he represents, the NY Times which for years has worked to blame Israel when it should have been defending the Middle East's only democracy.	2004-10-28

Much of what Roth would be later admired for is present in this work. A remarkable capacity for creating memorable characters, a tremendous liveliness and humor in language, a somewhat sarcastic view of American reality mixed up with a deeply romantic and idealistic one, fervent sexual interest. There is also in these works the kind of criticism of his home- team, the American Jewish family which would make him anathema to certain leading figures of the Jewish literary ( Irving Howe) and cultural establishment. The major piece of writing , the novella ' Goodbye Columbus' seems like it is the heir apparent to ' The Great Gatsby'. There is a  mastery of tone , precociously mature. That tone and that control will lead to the less successful line in Roth's writing, in which the narrator ( When She was Good) and the writer appear to be seeking entrance to the cathedral of Jamesian Anglo- American literature.  This novella has many skilled and interesting pieces of writing excellently evokes the world of Jewish American suburbia its business and family worlds. The love affair between Neil and Brenda Patinkin has a certain unsatisfactory quality especially in his ungenerous portrait of Brenda. The scene with the little black boy in the library fascinated by the works of Gaugin may be sentimental but is quite moving. As for the stories they too have a brilliance, and they also have that criticism of middle - class Jewish piety which Roth will be lambasted for .These are very good pieces of writing and would stand well on their own. But when Roth wrote ' Portnoy's Complaint ' he changed the way his previous work would be seen .And all would be understand as simply preliminary to that outrageous work of true literary genius. This is a fine book, but that is a great one.	2004-10-27

It rather relates to Hopkins unique greatness as a poet which I will try to say a few words about.<br /><br />Hopkins created his own style of verse, his own vocabulary for perceiving the world, his own special rhythm and language in poetry.<br /><br />He is not the most easy poet to understand, and I will admit that his longer poems lose me.<br /><br />When I consider his work I relate primarily to five, six , seven poems which seem to me extraordinary. \\" The world is charged with the Grandeur of God\\"  and \\" Thou art indeed just, Lord\\" and \\"Felix Randall the Farrier, Is he dead then?' are to me the most memorable. They contain a power and beauty, a tremendous sense of identification with and understanding of the suffering in life, a kind of unique and intimate perception of the details of the natural world.<br /><br />Hopkins the tormented priest wrote to my mind some of the most memorable and beautiful lines in the English language. Consider the closing of ' Thou art Indeed Just Lord\\"  \\"Birds build but not I build/ but break Times wounds And never breed one work that wakes Thou O My Lord of Life Send my roots Rain.\\"	2004-10-27

It is however interesting that Frankl's account is somewhat contradicted by the experience of another of the 'survivors' Primo Levi. For Levi survival depended a great deal on one's good luck, regardless of one's attitude or virtue. I think in general that those like Frankl and Levi who survived the ' worse horror ' have a kind of authenticity as witnesses which obliges us to give what they say, special attention and consideration.<br /><br />In this sense I think too that Frankl's central insight about our being moral creatures, who can help make meaning in our lives even in the most extreme circumstances is a very significant one.	2004-10-27

I do not remember exactly what she had to say about Captain Silver and Jim Hawkins , whether she felt the cunning and dishonest old curmudgeon Silver was somehow a sympathetic soul, and young Mr. Hawkins was a very worthy and wily apprentice. I do know that around about the same time the Big Screen showed a version of this tale which brought it more vividly to life. As a child I could not exactly understand why Captain Silver had to be ' bad ' at all, and what exactly Mr.Stevenson wanted for us. The treasure , the map , the finding of booty did not appeal very much to my young soul, and to tell the truth the whole tale seemed more like yet another ' adult trick' to make ' children' feel interested in 'school'. The rousing yarn that has held the attention of so many largely confused me. In this one however my guess is my own childhood impressions are pretty well of the mark, and do little justice to a book which has given so much suspenseful pleasure to young readers.	2004-10-27

As a participant in the War of Independence and as the major commentator and in fact ' national spokesman' in the 1967 war he well understands Israeli society from inside. He has great military knowledge and shows this in detailed explanations of the battle.

I will just say a few words about why this book when I read it for the first time many years ago so moved me, and why I still today feel it is the greatest of all 'novels' From the opening scene at the soiree of Anna Pavlovna Tolstoy creates a world, a world of immense vitality and scope. He creates a tremendous panorama of characters, and seems to depict the life of a whole society. He in doing this creates a moral and philosophical drama in which tremendously appealing and individualized characters meet and influence each other. He too does this in such a way as to seem to center on the fundamental questions of life, of family of society. He tells too a number of love stories and the story of a heroic struggle in war in a way which seem to ennoble life.<br /><br />And I think that this is the feeling that the book so strongly conveyed to me when I was a young person i.e. that life real life is something larger than I had ever known. And that to live truly live was something vastly greater than I myself had yet imagined. This book made me feel a deep love for life, life more mysterious life greater and more wonderful than what I had touched or tasted.<br /><br />There is so so much to be said about this book. Not one page or a hundred pages are enough to talk about Pierre and Andre and Natasha and Old Bolkonsky and Mary and Nicholas. There are scenes of such power here ( Prince Andree's death scene under the stars , or the turning moment of the great battle when the patient wise Kutuzov understands how it is the land and the distance and the winter and the waiting which will defeat the French invasion, or Pierre's wandering realization as soldier through the battle and his coming to realization of where his true life is) . I cannot even in small summary touch upon the meanings and themes of this great work, including the philosophical discussion of free will, and Tolstoy's own sense that the higher up one is in the world of power paradoxically the less free one is.<br /><br />I will just say that anyone who has the patience and the will to read through this work will come out of it with a greatly enhanced sense of the greatness of human life, and life's possibilities.I will just say that anyone who has the patience and the will to read through this work will come out of it with a greatly enhanced sense of the greatness of human life, and life's possibilities.	2004-10-27

My impression was much that of another Amazon reader. It is at times a vivid account of a new immigrant experience, but the tale is not told with the deepest intensity of feeling. It may be unfair but the comparison which comes to mind is with Henry Roth's \\"Call it Sleep\\" which is a fictional work but one which goes deep into the soul and consciousness.

The scion of one of America's most patrician families tells the story of his education. And his education is the story of his disillusionment with the time and world he comes to live in, and his idealization of a long lost medieval world. The Virgin of the medieval Catholic vision which represents for Adams an organic harmony is opposed and contradicted by the Dynamo of his own world. And that Dynamo is of scientific and technological progress accelerating at such an intense pace that the sense of the world, the center falls apart . And the Adams born to the heart of America's founding elite feels himself increasingly not at home in the world. The majestic tone, the third person narrative, the whole detached way he tells his own story prevents the reader from the most intense kind of sympathy with him. And yet his vision of a world somehow come apart in going too far and too fast in directions we do not understand does speak to us today.<br /><br />There are of course other aspects of the richness of the work, including the insight into the political worlds of the Washington of his time.<br /><br />But there is too a sense of an elite observer for whom the America of successive waves of immigration is not the real America . And there is a sense of Miniver Cheevy child of scorn cursing the day that he was born, of that is the ' old- line aristrocat ' who feel these new and other Americans have stolen his home and place from him.<br /><br />This is a work which much can be learned , and which certainly has much to be admired in it intellectually.

Against them is her main character, the one Yiddish writer who succeeds in an unbelievable way and whose works conquer America. This leading character is modeled obviously on the great I.B. Singer . In the story the other writers call him 'The Chazir ' or pig , not only because of his non- religious life style but obviously because he takes all the honors and rewards for himself. Ozick captures the language of this world, and its humor , the angry impossible humor of the Yiddish language itself. She writes with feeling of these frustrated difficult characters.

The essays as to be expected are not of uniform quality but many are truly outstanding. I remember one essay especially and that is Aviezer Ravitzky's essay on the concept of ' Shalom'. In a beautiful piece Ravitzky shows the various levels of the concept's meaning in Judaism. It is not simply ' peace' as the absence of war but rather defines the ideal relation within a person within a family within a society, the ideal relationship in which there is harmony, balance and completion.

Crane tells the story of young Henry Fleming who dreams of being a hero in battle, and instead in the first great fighting he knows runs in fear. The battle the reality and his own fear take him by surprise, and his imagination proves to be a poor preparation for the encounter with reality. The main drama of the work is then the young man's confrontation with his own act of cowardice and his redemptive acts of battlefield courage later on. This overcoming of himself, this transformation of himself is what makes the story a moral drama of the first order.<br /><br />Crane was a poet and one of the impressive features of the book is its poetic language.<br /><br />I know the work , have read it more than once, understand it to be a ' classic ' and yet am still somewhat reserved about it. I suppose this is because I never had the kind of overwhelming identification with the central charater which I did in certain books I love much more.	2004-10-25

It may not be anything like a real statistical sample, but the fact that so many of the people who write here suffered from depression , and were helped by this book is the best endorsement I can think of.<br /><br />I know without doubt that there are forms of depression and people so depressed that all of this would simply be mumbo- jumbo to them and not help at all. That's also part of the reality.<br /><br />From what I read of the book there were principles which made real sense. I noticed that when I tend to depression or when people I know are depressed there is always a focus on the negative detail. This is considered obsessively . I notice too other ' distortions' in thinking which seem to be identical with depression. One of these is of course the inability to see the positive element in anything.<br /><br />I do believe that ' changing the way one thinks can really help depressed people. And that this book can be of help.<br /><br />I also think it can be of help to those with a tendency to depression like myself, who somehow fight with this and overcome it most of the time.<br /><br />We are continual interpreters of reality .And we can make a heaven of hell, or a hell in heaven's despite. It would be wonderful if most of us good somehow see more of the 'good' and less of the evil. By the way this corresponds with traditional Jewish thinking which enjoins us always to try and see the positive first in someone , and to always try to ' look up'.	2004-10-25

Van den Haag like Paul Johnson and Thomas Cahill later writes from outside the Jewish experience with real appreciation and understanding. Having read the book many years ago I will simply give one small insight of his. According to Van den Haag the intelligence involved in disproprotionate Jewish contribution to scientific and cultural creation came in part because among the Jews the most intelligent the learned were encouraged to have large families, while in the Christian world the most intelligent were priests and encouraged to be celibate. A counter- argument could be made pointing out the relatively small size of the families of the non- Hasidic Jewish leadership. In any case this is one small example of a book rich with insight and certainly worth reading.	2004-10-25

Instead of looking inward only it was necessary to see the way we reshape ourselves in response to the kind of people we are with. The ' self' becomes a ' construct' which alters with performance, and with each new set of characters or scene we met. And so we ourselves are in effect many different selves, and there seems to be no limit to the new faces we can make in new worlds that we meet.<br /><br />All this was revelatory to me. And yet it seems to me now years later that Goffman was touching upon one kind of ' self- making and self- meeting'. And that the question of our own relation to ourselves, and the question of whether we have a real essential singular self ( or are simply a series of passing states as Hume and Buddha would seem to imply) does not seem to me solved by Goffman.<br /><br />But then his again his work is about ' the presentation of self in everyday life' and not the ' essence of self in eternity'.<br /><br />In any case this is a truly interesting and self- opening study.	2004-10-25

This is not a minor charge that can be dismissed by pointing out how the boorish Nazis misunderstood the complex philosopher. There is in Neitzsche an elitist arrogance, and a prophetic superiority, a tone of contempt for the ' masses' and a suggestion that truly it is only for the ' few ' that real life and thought are possible.<br /><br />True, this is one strand and it does not do justice to a great thinker's complex paradoxical and often remarkably insightful thought. But the evil that men do lives after them, and in the file of Neitzsche must too be registered the ' evil done' by those who took his ideas and misused them.<br /><br />That said what is there really to give heart and hope to in 'Thus Spake Zarathustra?\\"  Do we want to say Neitzsche is a prophet because like Ray Kurzweill he sees Mankind as a bridge between the ' ape' and the ' super-computer'? Do we want to linger on his cultural definition of Western civilization as being godless and point to the church- empty Europe today as sign of his sociological acuity? Do we wish to look at the Cosmos and say that his 'Eternal Recurrence' shows some kind of possible connection with our sense of ' alternative universes' or with the Indian philosophical understanding of time as vastly beyond our conventional Western frameworks? Do we want to see profundity in the poetical paradoxical or perhaps muddled meaningless utterances of the pseudo - prophetic voice?<br /><br />My sense is that in the deep bottom line of things Neitzsche has not given Humanity ideas, dreams, understandings that can truly help us realize our G-d given goal of sanctifying the universe as a whole, of making a tikkun olam in which we improve the lives and the quality of well- being of individual human beings. What Neitzsche has done I think, is to give the human mind another treasure of thought and poetic brilliance. In this sense I see his gift if to use Kierkegaard's terminology far more in the aesthetic realm than in the moral. In the moral realm I do not have much sympathy for his critique of Christianity, of slave - morality .And this because I believe human kindness and goodness are at the heart of what we are as human beings. And that it is not through contempt of others but rather through helping of them that we most live. For me then the man on the mountain can never be Zarathustra. For me the only mountain is Sinai where the most humble of men, Moses receives the Divine Revelation and then goes forth the second time to help Mankind walk in a way which is kinder.e his gift if to use Kierkegaard's terminology far more in the aesthetic realm than in the moral.

I will relate only to the letters of Van Gogh themselves , and that portion of them which I have read. They are surely one of the great documents for anyone interested in the connection between literary and artistic creation. They certainly too are a moving and frightening document of the inner life of a tremendously tormented soul and great artist. There is aside from this focus on Vincent the feeling given in the correspondance of what a considerate, helpful, wonderful brother he had . Just to listen to the rantings of a madman genius which often tend to repeat themselves and which however brilliant must often upset and throw one off one's equilibrium, is a great act of kindness. The friendship of the brothers is a great theme of this work. As for Van Gogh how tormented his soul how rich his creation.Those wavy lines those deeply clear eyes seem to express a kind of horror and fear no other artist can match.	2004-10-25

And that being the case it seems ridiculous to try and do anything more here than make a minor footnote to a footnote. The point as I understand it though of Whitehead is that if you wish to understand the basic terms and questions upon which the debates of the philosophical tradition are carried out you should know this work.<br /><br />I will make no attempt to summarize or to condense the many questions including the central one of the meaning of Justice and a Just Society which are at the heart of this work.<br /><br />I will just write down a few impressions, a few memories from the reading which took place many years ago .The first is that the work is conducted by a method of dialogue, what is called the 'maieutic ' method in which the philosopher Socrates the main character of the dialogues and Plato's great teacher acts as a 'mid-wife' bringing out the ' inherent truths ' in the mind of man through talking to others. It is all there in us pre- existent according to this view and the Truth simply needs to be brought out.<br /><br />This Truth however has a baffling meaning in the Central Myth of the Republic. This is the Myth of the Cave . The philosopher descends into the Cave and seeks in isolation to know the Ultimate Truth. But what he sees are the shadows of the shadows the fleeting images of sense which can hint at but not really convey ultimately the final truth. And the final truth in Plato's system and world is the Impersonal Abstract Idea which in turn is constructed of all other Ideas. It is as if we arrive finally at One but this one is not the personal G-d of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob but truly a God of the Philosophers somehow beyond and containing us all.<br /><br />At another level this is the great Political guide book of the Western world, and in Karl Popper's accusation the real blueprint for Totalitarianism and dictatorship. The three- part society depicted here is ruled in the end by the Philosopher- King elite, the know-it- alls who keep order by keeping everyone else in order. Liberal democracy is not Plato's final station for the Evolution of the Idea.<br /><br />All in all this is a too rich, too suggestive too meaningful work to write about seriously in a review like this. This work pervades the whole philosophical tradition that follows from Aristotle and through the neo- Platonists and on down to our own day.<br /><br />As for the dialogues and the figure of Socrates and Plato's relation to his own teacher these also are large questions endlessly explored and to be explored.<br /><br />Again who reads this work carefully has a real clue as to the nature of Western Philosophy. But who reads only this work knows Philosophy without the religious and ethical components the Biblical Literature will supply.Popper's accusation the real blueprint for Totalitarianism and dictatorship.

The hero is not as some may think the public figure hero the bullfighter, or the champion boxer or even the commanding soldier . The hero is like Hemingway himself and like Jake Barnes and in a way Nick Adams the one who has been wounded in the war and who must somehow \\" be stronger at the broken places\\". The public hero in his ' grace under pressure ' may give an example. But the code hero the true Hemingway hero has to imitate in silence without complaint, without big words, without heroic proclamation of himself those simple right actions which answer the situation. This is in accord with the famous Hemingway passage when he speaks about the inability after the War to use words like ' sacred ' and ' patriotic' , the big words. The code hero instead wounded, numbed must act in a kind of clean and efficient almost ritual way in restoring himself and the world. Simple action with a minimum of words. Action which is repeated almost like a ritual. Action which has something of the quality of the famous Heminway style with its hypnotic Biblical simplicity and its conjunctive connections. The rhythmic ' and ' and ' and' of Hemingway's prose conveys too the mirror of this kind of redemptive action.<br /><br />An excellent work for better understanding the whole structure and basic meaning of the Hemingway word and act.	2004-10-24

As a soldier in the Army of Israel he was involved in operations against international terrorism, including the rescue of the passengers from the Sabena Airline hijacking.He suffered a most painful loss when his older brother one of the great soldiers and potential leaders of Israel Yonatan Netanyahu was killed while leading the rescue operation at Entebbe. He has written about and studied the subject for years. And when he was Prime Minister of Israel he managed to reduce Palestinian terror to a relative low point. In this small work he outlines the dangers facing the world from international terrorism. And he gives productive ideas on how the West, and the free nations of the world can combat Terror and preserve their freedom. He points to the enhanced danger facing the world from the new kind of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism, and indicates how important Iran is in the terrorist network. The intensified effort of Iran to obtain nuclear weapons, is perhaps the greatest terror threat facing the world today.<br /><br />This book is a must read for all who would understand the dangers facing the West today.	2004-10-24

Given the conflicts within the Jewish world itself in regard to this issue this present volume is outstanding in reasonably arguing for the centrality of the Temple. Berman connects Temple worship with fundamental concepts of Jewish life and law, and makes a forceful argument for the idea that the restoration of the Jewish people as a holy people in a holy land can come to fuller realization through the rebuilding of the Temple.<br /><br />This is a work which deserves a much wider readership within the Jewish world itself , and also among those who would understand the place of the Temple and Har- ha- Bayit the Temple Mount to the Jewish people.<br /><br />It is of especial significance at a time when a considerable share of the Islamic world regrettably turns away from the historical record, and would deny the central place of the Temple in Jewish worship. The shameful fact that even today no Jewish prayer is allowed on the holiest site of Judaism is even more painful when one realizes how much the Holy Temple restored should mean .	2004-10-24

His greatest poems and lines are in the hearts and minds of most lovers of poetry. How disappointing then to feel that the person is in many ways so mediocre in both his thought and his personal relationships. The whole business of automatic writing is one part of it. But also the whole search for some kind of mythic system smacks of superstition, and perhaps makes Yeats suitable for an age where the 'New Age' sections of bookstores are far larger than the Religion of Philosophy sections.<br /><br />As a person Yeats seems a somewhat remote husband and distant relative even to his closest family members. This autobiography has no great moving intellectual center, no ideas which truly make sense in understanding our world . \\" Things fall apart the center does not hold, \\" the great lines which describe our condition are unfortunately not complemented by a true and deep understanding of the human situation.	2004-10-24

It's language is clear and precise. It's story is well- told. The animals who are the chief characters are depicted with clarity, and act as humans would. In fact that is the point. The story of the animals is the story of the humans. And the story of the animal's takeover of the Jones Family Farm is the story of the People's take over of Russia, away from its Czarist lords.<br /><br />And the celebration of the new equality which lasts so briefly is the glorious dawn of the Russian Revolution 1917. And the two clever - pigs (Snowball- Trotsky?) and Napoleon (Stalin? ) soon take advantage of their new - made power to exploit the other animals .The pigs become the oppressors, the animals persecute other animals. The Revolution brings back oppression and persecution only now in a worse way, because it is done by one's fellow animals. The most moving part of this is what happens to the faithful hard- working animals, the workhorse whose loyalty and hard- work do not bring a new world or redemption.<br /><br />This work is a wonderful easy read with vivid one- dimensional characters . And the animal/ human parallelism plays in a beautiful way to underscore the less than human in the human, and perhaps the more than animal in the animals.<br /><br />\\"All animals are equal and some animals are more equal than others\\" The statement of liberation becomes the statement of oppression. The would- be- revolutionaries become the new dictators .<br /><br />And Orwell at the end leaves us no way out , as if the human story is an animal farm with no exit.	2004-10-24

I decided that I would read a story every night before going to sleep. I picked up the Goodman Anthology of 'Seventy Five Short Short stories' I read one each night for seventy- five nights. I do not remember which bored me and which excited me and which seemed so important to me that they tempted me to change my life. If I remember rightly there was not even one single story which said \\"This is what  a story should be, what it must be.This is  the one story you would write if you could write one story' There was no such story. But there was entertainment and a variety of events and incidents. And there was too the wonder if perhaps a slightly larger space was needed to create a character for which one had real human sympathy . And this when I could think of how in various stories or novels a character had come to life in a single line or paragraph.<br /><br />Anyway I know no other anthology of seventy- five short - short stories. So for the time being if you want to read one short- short story a night for seventy- five nights this is the one.<br /><br />As for me when I reread myself to sleep tonight I will take Singer's ' Gimpel the Fool' or Hemingway's \\" A Clean- Lighted Place \\" or Salinger's \\"From Esme with Love and Squalor\\" and read that.<br /><br />It may be that ' short short' is simply not long enough.	2004-10-24

And the hero has courage.And the hero shows silent courage and dedication to his task. And the task is a great task , and one whose meaning does not end in itself alone, but has greater human significance. An old man is battling a fish . And the fish is greater and stronger than him. And the old man in the battling uses all the wisdom of his experience.  And the old man in seeking to catch and bring home the great fish , struggles with all he has. And the old man is destroyed but not defeated .<br /><br />And what he is he teaches to the ' boy' who is his helper who will be a fisherman after him. And will continue to be what he is.<br /><br />The language is simple and clear. The description is clean and light. The story is simple and moving.<br /><br />The parable is also readily understandable. Man at his best struggles with all he is against a Nature, a world , a Cosmos indifferent to him and ultimately stronger than he is. Yet in the manner of the struggle, the grace under pressure, the courage Man reveals himself to have a dignity which is great and uplifting.<br /><br />Hemingway toward the end of his days writes the parable of his own struggle , and of his own ideal conception of Mankind in the Universe. And he does it in such a convincing way so as to enable us the readers to take greater pride and hope in our own humanity.	2004-10-23

But it is quintessential Salinger and perhaps more of what he really wanted to get at , than anything else. The two stories are about the Glass family, the one \\"The Raise High The Roofbeams\\" story about Seymour's wedding day which takes place during the Second World War. The ceremony never takes place, and the story told by the Salinger alter ego Buddy Glass recounts his effort to get to the wedding, his riding to the ceremony with a group of wonderfully depicted characters.  It also contains ( as does the ' Seymour story') material connected with the effort to build the Seymour character as a kind of mythic center of the Salinger world. He is the Glass' poetic genius who invents a kind of double- haiku which shows not only his love of the East, but his being a true child of upper West Side Manhattan. \\"John Keats, John Keats, John, Please put your scarf on/ is one small example that Salinger gives us of Seymour's supposed very great poetry . The effort to build the Seymour legend is made by the number two brother Buddy , and his correspondance with his brother and his brother's criticism of the stories Buddy is trying to write is also part of the story.<br /><br />I am wandering here , and not in the best way, and certainly not in a Salinger way.

Salinger depicts Seymour as a kind of Kafka Kierkegaard Van Gogh ringding poetic truthteller, authentic genius, burned by the pain of the world. He also in doing this gives much in his wonderful colloquial language of the Manhattan world of this time.<br /><br />My review here is poor and rambling, but Salinger's two long stories however filled with wonderful digressions they are, are true- to - the mark real literature.<br /><br />Don't let anyone tell you that Salinger is letting you down here.

It is one of the outstanding works of twentieth century writing. It is a description in tremendous detail of a world which did everything to keep itself being described. The writing of it was the heroic act done at risk to his own life of a former inmate of the Gulag who told the truth of Stalin's nightmare world and portrayed the suffering of millions. This ' breaking of silence' had historical as well as literary significance and may have been a key element in the fall of the Soviet Empire.<br /><br />There is a point where Solzhenitsyn apprehended by the KGB and taken to the Gulag asks himself why he did not scream out. He says that he wanted to scream not so that one or two would hear. But that he wanted to scream for the millions so the millions would hear.<br /><br />In this tremendously moving work he does this.	2004-10-22

It is one of the many I have read through the years which I do not hold most of in mind, but reminded of recall to a certain degree. ' Seven Nights' impressed me as lesser Borges. The Dante lecture, the lecture on nightmare, the lecture on Kabbalah seemed less essential than Borges words on poetry which too seemed to me only one definition among many .This book of course has those Borges qualities, tremendous learning, capacity to connect between different books and worlds, irony and humor, a certain kind of dignity , the great great love of Literature which inform all of Borges work.<br /><br />In a way this work leads me to another thought about books. It is that there are writers we love so much that the discovery of an additional even minor work of theirs gives us great pleasure even though it cannot equal their greatest work.<br /><br />So 'Seven Nights'. And again thanks to other Amazon reviewers who helped me with this review.	2004-10-22

The judge- penitent Jean- Baptiste Clamence who tells of his own fall from a position of moral superiority to one of what seems to be nihilistic lostness speaks it seems to himself for himself. Unlike Camus greatest work ' The Plague' there is no sense of other live and interesting characters, no sense of a social world. All is enclosed in upon the narrator himself who has lost his way in a world which seems devoid of grace and joy and love.<br /><br />This was for me the most discouraging of all the works of Camus I have read. For even Sisyphus with the rock rolling down time and time again has the decision of whether to begin rolling it up again.

Traditional ' learning' is a different story entirely and involves going through each tractate as it is written. And while the Tractates are organized around subjects they often contain much diverse matter. Also ' learning 'them involves an intense kind of study most often with a ' chavruta' or learning partner, or in another framework with others. That kind of study is much different from simply reading as it involves a much more slower, more difficult and deep process of intellectual understanding. This work is a good one for the ' reader' but ' learning' as such requires a different kind of investment and effort.	2004-10-21

One Jewish interpretation	I am sure I do not understand Kierkegaard fully .But what I will try to do in this brief review is recall what I do understand and compare it to an interpretation of the very same event , the Akedah, the Binding and Sacrifice of Isaac from the Jewish point- of- view.<br /><br />As I understand it Kierkegaard sees Abraham as an exemplar of the ' teleological suspension of the ethical' Already in Either- Or Kierkegaard spoke of these three realms, the aesthetic, the ethical and the religious. This is a heirarchy . Abraham in effect transcends the second realm, transcends the ethical ( which would of course mandate against ' murder' and especially against the murder of one's own beloved child) and gives himself wholly to the ' religious' By this is meant he places his absolute trust in God . And his obedience to God, his absolute trust in God transcends any human committment even the highest ethical one. Thus the absurdity of his action is on the ethical level, but not on the level in which he totally commits himself to God. Obedience to God is faith in God is the highest way for the ideal religious figure that Abraham represents.<br /><br />Yet Abraham is not permitted to carry out the sacrifice. ( Did he inwardly intuit that he would not be permitted to? And was this the sign of his far deeper trust in G-d?<br /><br />Instead Abraham is prevented from continuing in the pagan tradition of child sacrifice and induced to set out on a new higher ethical way for mankind. (The path of ethical monotheism) in which each and every human life is sacred. And such sacrifice is forbidden because it violates the divine commandment against taking a human life, (And this when the human being is created in the image of G-d ) thus meaning the human is forbidden from sacrificing the divine in the human for the Divine.<br /><br />Paradoxically in the Jewish tradition the whole completed action which is not simply Abraham's willingness to sacrifice but G-d's forbidding of this sacrifice is to affirm a higher ethical path. This I would venture is one Jewish interpretation of the Akedah, of a new dawn a higher way for mankind where human life is more sacred than before.<br /><br />May the readers of this review forgive me for not resting with Kierkegaard's interpretation .We are all after all made in the image of G-d, and each one of us may and perhaps must have his own interpretation to give.gher ethical path.

James is its great popularizer along perhaps with Dewey. Pragmatism in James is a ' theory of truth' which cancels common - sense correspondance theory of truth, and says that truth is the ' cash - value' of a proposition. The results of an idea or proposition in the marketplace are according to James ' its truth'. This sounds odd and in fact is certainly not what we ordinarily mean when we speak about the truth. It does make a certain sense however in trying to order the decisions of our life, and may help us in judging those beliefs we wish to hold on to.<br /><br />My own sense is that this theory is pretty thin stuff, and the greater James is in the psychology of the ' Varieties of Religious Experience'<br /><br />Again it seems to me that Pragmatism adds a certain element to the conception of Truth we should have, but it misses out on other crucial dimensions. There after all are truths which are painful, and truths which we do not want to know, and truths which it does not help us to know, and truths which we must grudgingly admit, and truths which do not promise to help us at all but may hurt us very much.	2004-10-21

He recognizes and absorbs the ' identity ' of his major rivals of the time Bellow and Roth and shows he also can be them and be that. But a projection however clever does not in this case have the power of what is closer to him, with him. And there is greater authenticity and strength in the 'Rabbit Books'.<br /><br />I have I think also an objection which only a minority of readers will share. Bech is a pasteboard Jew who has no real deep Jewish knowledge or identity. This does not mean characters like him do not exist, or Updike had no right to create him. It does mean that those of us looking for some depth when they meet a Jewish intellectual or cultural figure are quite disappointed.<br /><br />In any case it is clear that for Updike Bech is just a sideshow, one of the many that constitute parts of the complex identity of this very remarkable American writer.	2004-10-20

James gathers together accounts of the mystical meeting with God from the panoply of the world's religious traditions. One of his conclusions not surprisingly is that people often come to meet the conception or intellectual construct or content in regard to God that they have brought with them.<br /><br />James in collecting the evidence and analyzes and attempts to give an overall definition of the structure of the mystical religious experience. The case- histories are the evidence upon which the empiricist James will draw his conclusions.<br /><br />Among the famous distinctions that do make a difference in the work is the distinction between first- born and twice- born souls. The first born are those who are alright and happy in their lives. The twice- born are those upon whom James places the emphasis. These are the people who go through some 'dark night of the soul' in which they seem to lose themselves and their world, live in a blackness of Nothingness, until the miraculous transformation comes and they are born again as new beings. This being born again comes through their meeting with God. And again the God they discover is often the God of the religious tradition which they take in.<br /><br />It is interesting that in many of the accounts there is talk of merger with and fusion with God, of being absorbed by God. This is somewhat different from the Jewish mystical conception in which one can only approach G-d closer and closer but never really hope to be identical with the One and Only One.<br /><br />One interesting aspect of the work is James' use of his own experience, his own personal depression as one of the case - histories. In his case it was not the encounter with God which saved him, but ' the will to freedom' which he learned from the French thinker Renouvier. Paralyzed and loss his act of will to freedom would constitute in a deep psychological way a repudiation of the life of his own Swedenborgian mystical father, and lead to his own supremely active life.<br /><br />James summary conclusions about these experiences and about the mystical encounter lead him not to one definite conclusion, but rather to something like Wittgenstein's family resemblance of overlapping categories of classification.In these he tries too to use pragmatic categories of judgment and understand what he calls the ' cash value ' of the experience i.e. its real benefit in the person's future life. James also talks about something which is certainly not the God most of the mystics have found. They believe and connect with an Infinite Power, but James in his own life and thought seeing the force of Evil in the world held on to the idea of a ' finite God ' who aims at good and needs the help of humanity to realize the right goals in history .This idea in someway parallels the Jewish religious idea of covenant partnership with God, in Tikkun Olam the transformation of the world for good.<br /><br />It is impossible in a review like this to do justice to this great work, and the great mind and human being who compiled and composed it. It is a must for anyone who cares to better know and understand the religious life. The conclusions they draw may not be James' but they will be helped in understanding religious life better, nonetheless.wn supremely active life.  <br />James summary conclusions about these experiences and about the mystical encounter lead him not to one definite conclusion, but rather to something like Wittgenstein's family resemblance of overlapping categories of classification.In these he tries too to use pragmatic categories of judgment and understand what he calls the ' cash value ' of the experience i.e. its real benefit in the person's future life.

Yehoshua (Judaic Traditions in Literature, Music, and Art)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A first-rate novelist and very poor thinker	These interviews are with one of the finest Hebrew language writers working today. Yehoshua is an outstanding storyteller and creator of character.<br /><br />However as a thinker he tends to return to a few fixed ideas, ideas which in some cases are based on ignorance. One of these ideas is that the Jews in the Diaspora had no real creative power or identity of their own. The second is that the Jewish state should help create an Arab state within the total land West of the Jordan, and that while withdrawing all Jews from it the state of Israel should support and encourage the development of a large Arab minority within it. In other words Yehoshua is for a Judenrein Arab state, and a Jewish state which is in good part Arab. And for no Diaspora at all.<br /><br />This book does not probe Yehoshua very deeply. He does talk about his own literature with some insight. But the questions could have been deeper and the book a lot better.	2004-10-20

And this with the idea that so long as we are rolling the rock we are not defeated, and there is human dignity in the world.<br /><br />But let us leave Camus for a moment, and leave Sisyphyus .And let us forget the rock also .And let us quietly look up at the sky and tremble at the mystery of Being, and the wonder of what is that it is .This too is a kind of rock, the religious moment in which we wonder where all has come from, and whether or not perhaps beyond it all, there is a Creator not simply of rocks but of human minds and souls and hearts.<br /><br />And then let us return to Camus and Sisyphus and their rock. And as we push it up the hill with all our hearts we feel then suddenly not alone but other human beings pushing it with us.And the rock not simply a rock but a foundation stone for the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. And all of us rock- pushers and prayers servants of God in a life that is meaningful.<br /><br />Oh rock, Oh Camus, oh Sisyphus, O world with G-d that  we can find meaning and joy and love in- in life that is no longer wholly Absurd.	2004-10-20

Its subject is the first great poet in modern Hebrew, and one of greatest Jewish cultural figures of modernity. His poetic oeuvre is not huge but forms an essential part of the modern Hebrew canon. Bialik was also a central figure in the early years of cultural life in Eretz Yisrael. His great anthology of Biblical legends Sefer- ha Agadot  done with his friend Ravnitzky is too a foundation work in modern Hebrew literature.<br /><br />Aberbach understands Bialik's greatness and writes of him with warmth and intelligence.	2004-10-20

Why does it seem to say so much about America? Why is it so great?<br /><br />One, I think it is because it is about the American dream of success. And it is about the tragic failure of its realization. And it is because it is about the whole question of honesty-dishonesty in the pursuit of success. And about family life and love , and what is really important in this.<br /><br />It is too because the work is written in a beautiful, restrained American colloquial. The language of the book is a quiet poetry which moves with great great lines.<br /><br />I think I saw the play on television, and perhaps in the movies long before I read it. The image of Lee J. Cobb as a floundering Willy Loman, a confused hero struggling for his life and dignity remains in mind. I believe it was Mildred Dunnock who played the faithful wife, the betrayed wife, the loving wife so effectively.<br /><br />The story of Willy , the traveling salesman at the end of his career, fighting to maintain himself on a ' shoestring' and a<br /><br />'story' cannot help but move. The real complication is Willy's relation to his family to the great promise of his son Biff who somehow fails in the same way his father does. Too much show, too much promo , too much trying to make it seem more and better than it really is.<br /><br />And then too of course the painful reason, the central event told in flashback of the young man's coming to see his father on- the -road and discovering him with another woman in a shoddy hotel room. The sexual and familial betrayal is too a part of the tragedy which is of the family as a whole.<br /><br />What Miller does however is not simply depict a faulty, failing Willy Loman he leads us to feel sympathy for him. This is the American dreamer (\\" A man's got to dream boy , it comes with the territory\\") And his wife's understanding even at the end also moves and adds a dimension of dignity . It seems to tell a lesson beyond success and failure i.e. that human dignity and respect should not depend upon ' making it' but must be given to each and every human being , and perhaps most especially precisely to those who fail.<br /><br />This is a heartrending deep and beautiful play. And however haunted we may be by the fall of Willy Loman we come away from it with the sense that his life too, that each life too has a special meaning of its own.ty and respect should not depend upon ' making it' but must be given to each and every human being , and perhaps most especially precisely to those who fail.  <br />This is a heartrending deep and beautiful play.

I have the sense that the Jewish Mind if we consider its creations from Biblical Time to now is simply too vast and varied for easy definition.

It was the work which made the study of Literature a  ' field of Knowledge' and not simply  a kind of arena of diverse opinion. It took the whole history of Literature and organized it in such a way that any work could somehow find its place, and be fit into it.<br /><br />I tried very hard to understand this work, and I believe I really did not get it. Perhaps it was a certain skeptical element in me which simply felt that each work , each of the real works was so unique that ' fitting it into a scheme' did not make much sense of it all. Another problem was despite my liking of the lyrical Blake I felt Frye too much gone on those Blakean mythmonster poems which I myself felt so dull and idiosyncratic.<br /><br />One idea from the work remains with me certainly- and this is the idea that Literature is created not out of nothing, but out of previous Literature. I would qualify this a bit by saying that it is also created out of our experience. But I do not mean to be ' correcting ' or putting down Frye. I recognize that there is some kind of heroic effort here to put it all together for the greater understanding of us all.<br /><br />It just never worked for me. And I will readily admit I may be very very wrong , and simply a poor reader here.	2004-10-20

I at the time was not only broken by the loss of a marriage I had thought a good one, but was tremendously guilty about the burden I had placed on my children. This book in a sense confirmed my view that ' divorce' is often a selfish act of a parent, or parents taken against the interests of the children.<br /><br />As I read the book worrying about the long- term consequences for my children, I took a certain encouragement in one kind of example Wallerstein gave. She pointed out that certain children of divorce come away stronger somehow , determined that they will build good families, and not make the mistake their parents made. That of course is my prayer for my children.<br /><br />In any case this is a very interesting book, the best one I have as yet encountered on the whole subject of the effect of divorce on the children.<br /><br />I just hope that you will not be one of those who needs to read it for ' practical advice'.	2004-10-19

These interviews comprise the heart of this book. What is remarkable about it is the struggle and idealism of so many of these Israeli pioneers who in the course of their lives and work contributed much to humanity. Their work in certain areas for instance in treating malaria has had significant implications for humanity as a whole. The  previously untold record of their contributions to the war- effort is a chapter of history which otherwise would have been forgotten but which Rifkah Ashbel by her effort, and persistence, redeemed.	2004-10-19

He is also a remarkable literary figure, and the self- described centaur who is composed of a scientific, work, chemist side, and a literary, poetic side. These interviews in which he discusses the Shoah( The Holocaust) his experiences, and his witness, his writing, his relation to his Jewishness, his relation to many beloved writers of his enriches our sense of the man and his work. His calm reassuring moral voice is the voice of one who has seen much and been able to tell its story. At the end of the interviews there is a sense of weariness , and a sense of having said it all. There too is a feeling that the younger generation no longer can really sense what he is saying, as the younger generation could after the war. Levi is a truly poetic and deep soul, but exact as a scientist and a therefore seemingly a most reliable witness. His finding human dignity in simple work is another major theme of his work and life. And his modest, practical and realistic answers ( for instance to the question of why he did not distribute food found and made at the point of liberation to three thousand prisoners when he was with ten who ate the food and were kept alive by it) shows his awareness of his own human limitation and fundamental decency.<br /><br />One caveat. The very leftist interviewers in the Jewish section seem to go out of their way to make Levi criticize Israel for its 1982 effort to stop terrorism coming at it from Lebanon. Levi is critical of Israel but only to a certain point, and does not fall into the trap of condemning the Jewish state. After all he knows what it is to be attacked as a Jew and he understands that the Jewish state is fighting for its survival.<br /><br />All in all this is a wonderful set of interviews with one of the great voices of conscience of the twentieth century.	2004-10-18

It is written in fragments, but these fragments are often brilliant poetic thoughts . Many of them have become part of the everyday vocabulary of the Western mind. \\" Man is a reed, but he is a thinking reed\\" \\" The silence of these infinite spaces cast me into dread\\"<br /><br />Among the major suggestions of Pascal's thought is the Pascalian wager which William James picked upon. Roughly speaking betting on the non- existence of G-d gives nothing. But betting on the existence of G-d give the possibility of eternity. Therefore says Pascal we should be wise and bet on the existence of God. And this though it is not certain that God wants us as gamblers.<br /><br />Pascal's insights also extend into his reading of the Bible and his special insight into the destiny of Israel. His God after all is not \\" the god of the philosophers but the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob \\" Pascal saw the continued survival the miraculous survival of the people of Israel through generations of persecution and suffering as a proof of the existence of G-d. And for that alone I have tremendously warm feelings for him.And this aside from the gratitude of his overwhelmingly powerful and beautiful insights.<br /><br />This is one of the great books for probing the heart of Man and the Universe.

Arendt makes of each portrait a life- story, often a most moving story, and a presentation and critical assessment of the figure 's life- work. In some cases she had a central part in introducing to an English reading audience seminal figures ( Walter Benjamin and Hermann Broch are the outstanding examples) who were far less well known , than they would come to be. She chooses figures whose power of creation is great and unique, and she assesses them in terms of her own set of categories and understandings. One outstanding instance is her evaulation it is really a laudatio a work of praise for the great Pope John XXIII .She speaks of his remarkable simplicity, humanity and courage. His simple great faith \\"Every day is a good day to be born, and every day is a good day to die\\"<br /><br />Some of the portraits are of personal acquaintances and friends. And one feels that in writing about them she is somehow doing for them what she in her \\" The Human Condition\\" spoke about as the role of the poet the immortalization of the hero and their deeds. She has a wonderful eye, and her description for instance of the awkwardness with material things of Waldemar Gurian catches the essence of the person in a striking way.<br /><br />All in all the portraits of Men in Dark Times shed light on the human character and soul, and are a testimony not only to the greatness of the subjects but to the greatness of the writer herself.	2004-10-18

Berlin analyzes the mind of Tolstoy as revealed in 'War and Peace'. He uses a quotation from Aristochulus , \\"The hedgehog  knows  one big  thing, but the fox  knows many little things \\"He then categorizes various intellectual figures as hedgehogs or foxes.  He says that Tolstoy was a fox who wanted to be a hedgehog. In other words Tolstoy longed to put all reality into one great explanatory system but his faithfulness to his own remarkable sense of perception led him to see everywhere the fine distinctions and individual differences which constitute his own richly varied world.<br /><br />What is interesting is that Berlin himself was fundamentally a fox in the world of ideas. He believed that there could be no one fundamental system explaining all. He not simply reveled in the variety of ideas, but he thought in terms of values that ' ideal ends' even within the individual's own thought are incompatible. That is that it is not simply a question of the ' variety of the world' which confounds the system - builder but the ' inherent contradictions ' within it , which cannot be resolved into any great single Platonic or Hegelian system.<br /><br />A celebrator of the variety of life and existence Berlin saw that Tolstoy could represent and create such variety in the highest possible way while still somehow wishing he were able to unite it all into one.<br /><br />Apparently there is 'no unified field theory' in the world of history or the history of ideas , either.	2004-10-18

Yes, Bloom's work is filled with tremendously interesting insights into Literature,remarkable unexpected connections between creators who seemed so distant from each other.<br /><br />No, Literature does not follow the simple law of progression, or the simple Law of a creator's strong reaction to the strong creators before. There are figures in Literature who in some way seem to be reacting to no one( Hopkins is one good example) and figures whose whole discourse is in absorbing the creation of others not to transcend them but to celebrate them.( Borges) There are also creators who however they may be influenced by others, as Kafka was influenced by Dickens and perhaps Kierkegaard, have such a unique way of seeing the world that they seem to be born of themselves. In Literature it is not necessary always to stand on the shoulders of Giants much less knock the Giant down if one is to move forward.<br /><br />The laws of literary creation are as mysterious and individual as the next new voice which  comes to the world. Quixote may over- ride the romantic chivalrous literature Cervantes parodies but he does this in a comically humane way that no one before or since has or could surpass.	2004-10-18

Years later I subjected one of my children to the same ordeal when she needed to write a book- report. And this because I found then and now, this moral tale of redemptive love to be moving and instructional. For young people and I expect for most readers today the complexity of Eliot's language is an obstacle to be overcome. She writes the kind of sentences the masters of style have been teaching Americans not to write for years. But she writes with great intelligence and intuition, great moral feeling. The story of the weaver unjustly accused of a robbery, who retreats into his own private world and who is later redeemed by his meeting and taking care of an orphan child is one which cannot help but touch the heart. And as Hawthorne said when the heart is touched we begin to be .And this work comes alive with the old codger's care for and love of the orphan child. Like Scrooge the other great scowling isolato of nineteenth century Literature he exemplifies and proves the greatest moral lesson of all, that in loving and caring for other human beings we become human ourselves.<br /><br />Who can make it through the difficult language will find not only a very detailed and convincing description of English village life in the early nineteenth century but also a warm tale of the human heart healing itself through love.	2004-10-18

Her understanding of the concept of totalitarianism which analyzed together the Nazi and Soviet terror worlds is a major achievement. Her philosophical works are deep and rich, and provide a sense of the greatness and dignity of human life and thought.<br /><br />But in this work she fails morally, and exposes her own personal frailty. In writing about the executioner of what is arguably the greatest crime done in human history , she makes the terrible moral slip of in some way demeaning the victims further, and in some way finding , if not excuse, then 'alleviation' for the executioneer. She does the first not only by her indictment of the leaders of the Jewish councils, but even more severely by the tone she often takes to the victims. It is a German superiority and contempt , the tone of the foremost pupil of Nazi- sympathizer Heidegger. Her alleviation of evil of the evildoers is by this time well- known argument that the man in the box represented the ' banality of evil' He was no Faust or Satan but rather a little clerk looking out for his own little end, and trying to climb up a bit in the heirarchy. And while it is true that he was no great genius or hero, in fact he was very ideologically committed to the program of the Nazis. And that program and that ideology and its execution were the heart of the Evil. Arendt many believe did mankind a moral service by showing us just what ordinary people are capable of. And subsequent genocides in Cambodia or Rwanda and now in Darfur many argue show that is the case. But that point , however well taken i.e. the point that the ordinary human being can be not simply the passive witness,but the active participant in evil by no means excuses those particular individuals and that particular people who committed this crime. The ordinary man become a monster is still a monster.<br /><br />But to repeat and above all, Arendt's great moral failing here was in her coldness , her lack of sympathy, compassion and human understanding for the victims.<br /><br />No intelligence and no superior intellect and even no greatness , can excuse for wanton cruelty to other human beings, especially those who have suffered so much.n her coldness , her lack of sympathy, compassion and human understanding for the victims.  <br />No intelligence and no superior intellect and even no greatness , can excuse for wanton cruelty to other human beings, especially those who have suffered so much.	2004-10-18

But like all democracies opinion is divided in the US about almost everything. Bennett writes as an American patriot and I think it is fair to say that his common sense views are supported by a great majority of Americans. He sees the international terror alliance against freedom and democracy and knows it must be resisted. He is not afraid to see Islamic fundamentalism as a major problem confronting the US today , though the book is written before the time that Iran was on the verge of becoming a nuclear power.<br /><br />What is most important however is that Bennett clearly sees the nature of the struggle it is in. And how the challenge of the years ahead is not turning away from it, but meeting it with ingenuity and courage.	2004-10-18

This story tells of his adventures in doing so, and introduces to the world of minor - league baseball , and major- league character- building that is at the heart of Zane Grey's story. As a child I read this book hundreds of times. I would go to sleep with it every night. It helped me escape into the world of my dream the world of ' making it as a baseball big- leaguer'. The story is after all a story of how through many hardships and disappointments Chase Alloway nonetheless helps his team win the pennant, gets to meet and marry a beautiful girl, is able to come home and bring his mother and brother the happy news of their better fortune.<br /><br />It is an American success story , but it is told with a really beautiful feeling for the small- town America of the time, a really deep knowledge and love of the game of baseball.<br /><br />For many moments of happy pleasure and escape, for many hours of wonderful dreaming I thank this book so much.	2004-10-17

As one who wanted to know who loved to know this book promised an entrance to the world of higher wisdom. Russell tells the story of philosophy as if it is a continuous narrative, a kind of progress in which successors learn from and transcend their predecessors. It all of course comes to climax in the analytic philosophy of his own time. But he does not present this last chapter  as a final conclusion, but rather as a problem still problematic and needing addressing.<br /><br />From the point- of - view of many years later the work still has its charm, still seems a wonderful piece of literary work, but is understood in many ways as prejudiced. Russell did not have space in his heart and mind for Kierkegaard, and the whole world of Existensialism. He did not really give much space to the philosophy of religion, or spiritual experience of any kind. The work does not really take into account sufficiently the scientific and technological developments which transform so greatly our understanding of ourselves and our world. It seems to me the ' philosophy' we need today, the wisdom we need today is much broader than that Russell envisaged. At the same time the Queen of the Sciences has if we rely on the analytic tradition alone contracted and is less central than before.<br /><br />With all objection and qualification however this work is a wonderful introduction to the History of Philosophy, in no small part because of Russell's  great enthusiasm for the subject and capacity to convey this in sparkling prose.	2004-10-17

Moses Herzog who is suffering something like a breakdown after being betrayed and  left by his beautiful and impossible second wife, who takes with her their daughter takes to writing letters to the world, to the living to the dead, to family to the famous to whoever he has a message for . This device gives  the work a special intellectual liveliness and humor. .The work has remarkable characters including Herzog himself his best friend and betrayer Valentine Gersbach, the second wife Madelaine and her successor Bellow's mistress, the spectacularly sensual Ramona.<br /><br />Herzog is an intellectual and part of his task is figuring it all out. And so the book is filled with meditations on the state of Western Civilization , meditations which at one hand can be taken ironically but are often strangely profound. The great connecting device of the novel is in the letters because they connect Bellow's personal state and breakdown with his perception and attempt to understand the Civilization as a whole.<br /><br />This is a thinking man's novel, a philosophical novel in the best sense.

Today when Science is no longer worshipped as a one way vehicle in the direction of Progress, there is at least on part of some a greater wariness as to Man's capacity to arrange , plan, and create all in accordance with his wishes. Herman Kahn was a person of tremendous intelligence and knowledge, and was not afraid to try and think ahead even if this meant risking being made a fool .The prediction here about fusion reactors solving our energy problems is a good example of the kinds of mistake Kahn sometimes made.

And in this sense Roth cannot be faulted for writing a counterfactual conditional book , about a proposed Nazi takeover of the United States in 1940. He certainly cannot be faulted for writing a moving description of his parents and their world, and their imagined reactions to such a takeover.<br /><br />Where he can be faulted is in his making it very clear both within the work, and in the publicity around its publication that this ' timely ' work is some kind of reflection upon the American reality of the Bush administration. Does he really honestly believe that the US today is endangered by a possible ' Fascist' takeover? Doesn't he understand that the real challenge the US is facing today is one in which totalitarian states and terrorist forces are not simply killing individuals including Americans but working to undermine democracy and freedom in the world?<br /><br />Roth has been criticized in the past by the Jewish Establishment for his critical portrayal of Jewish characters. I would make a different criticism, his shifting attention away from the real source of Anti- Semitism in the US today. The major source of anti- Semitism today is from the same political camp that Roth ostensibly belongs to, the Left. Only of course it is now a very mixed up left , as it's anti- Semitism is bound up with a support for totalitarian states like Iran , which are of course the greatest danger to the Jewish people and the United States today.<br /><br />However good the Literature is here, and when Roth is good there is no one better, the Politics is truly dangerously unfair and mistaken.	2004-10-16

It is written from Kafka the tormented son to his father Hermann. It tells of the relationship of father and son, as seen by the son. But a good part of the son's seeing is his understanding of his father, and his father's perception of and disappointment with him. It is an analysis of his father's life also , and in a way an attempt to make a kind of connection with the distant father the son has not really had in life.<br /><br />For anyone  who has had a difficult father whose love and approval they so much longed for , and did not have - this work will be a soul- opening one.

It is the kind of work that gives a ' whole new picture of what is happening'. And if for this alone this work would be of great value.<br /><br />I am by no means a media expert and cannot really comment on many of the claims of the work .<br /><br />Its virtues are in calling attention to the new media( mainly television) and understanding how it changed our perception of the world, and of ourselves.<br /><br />The basic MacLuhan distinction between hot and cold media between those which give us a lot of information and those which require our own greater participation in creating the reality , seems to me sensible to a degree. But where MacLuhan lost me was in his celebration of the present reality, the new culture.<br /><br />I for one have the old- fashioned sense of the superiority of the reading world to the television world- the superiority of the kind of minds it produces.<br /><br />I too think MacLuhan was over- optimistic in seeing the ' global village' as a kind of positive development for mankind. The fact is our world today is tremendously complex politically, fragmented in not necessarily wonderful ways.<br /><br />It is possible to argue that this work ' foresaw ' the Internet, but even if this were the case it seems to me that we still have to consider the overall question of the meaning, value and virtue of the Internet.<br /><br />Mankind's situation I want to suggest is much much more complex than ' the media is the message' in the ' global village' suggests.<br /><br />I do not again think I have even begun to do justice to the richness and variety of MacLuhan's insights.<br /><br />I just here would like to register the view that I do not believe that he really has given us ' the key' to understanding our world. I would even go farther and say however rich the understanding he provides about the media, and their relation to each other- he too is far from the last word in this.

The scene shifts to the young man in the war itself writing her a letter as he is breaking down. Another of the stories \\" A Perfect Day for Bananfish\\" will be the core of much of Salinger's later writing about the Glass family. It tells of Seymour Glass , the oldest of the Glass children their greatest genius and poet, of his marriage and his suicide. Among the other most memorable stories( though they are all memorable ) are \\" The Laughing Man\\" \\" Uncle Wiggly in Connecticut\\" and \\"Teddy\\"<br /><br />Salinger's great ability to recapture the world of childhood, his remarkable feel for the New York urban world of his time , his spiritual surmisings and presentation of his own eccentric but at the time new and lovable way of looking at the world combine to make these stories one of the most enjoyable I know of.	2004-10-15

So I sit down and I begin to read and its like these people on the page are the very spitting image very spitting of those we are meeting every day just on our corner . And these characters are very much like those my Uncles Jack and Reddy are inviting in the house all the time to play pinochle only even more funny and almost as nasty .So I say this book comes out of American life and is the genuine article although someone else tells me a lot of these guys most of been reading Damon Runyan and so started acting and talking like his characters just to make it seem that they are bigshots which is of course what they all are-when they are not broke which is most of the time.<br /><br />Well this has not been a very successful effort at parody or paraphrase or whatever is, but it is a way of saying you will really really enjoy reading about ' Nicely Nicely' and 'Nathan Detroit ' and all the other Runyan characters. Ring Lardner may have been a smarter guy but old Damon Runyan why he  could almost make colloquial as good as old JD Salinger would a little later from a bit further uptown.<br /><br />Try it , try it you'll really really like it.	2004-10-14

It contains the biographies of one - thousand well- known Jews. However as could be expected there is considerable room for doubting some selections and lamenting the exclusion of  others. My own particular trouble- spot was the omission of Rabbi Shlomo Goren who contributed so much to the building of the modern State of Israel. Rabbi Goren not only shaped the Army Rabbinate, he helped create the religious law that is central in many different areas of  Jewish life today . He is also the rare combination of a man of book and sword, a man deeply learned and at the same time courageous in action.<br /><br />One other point. Jewish history is filled with the lives of thousands upon thousands of remarkable individuals whose creations and works are not known. A true biography of Jews who made real contributions to their own people and to the world would have to include hundreds of thousands of entries. Thus this value is really a condensation in the most meaningful sense of all.	2004-10-14

His work appeals on many different levels. First of all , he writes about the experiences of love and of war, and of everyday life in a society fighting for its life. Secondly , he uses his knowledge of traditional Jewish sources to create a rich ironic and contemplative text .Thirdly he is as a writer and as a person, ' decent' and ' fair'. Fourthly, his language has the quiet beauty of Hebrew colloquial .<br /><br />Amichai's poetry captures the mood of the  holy city the city in which there is so much beauty and so much conflict and contradiction. And he enhances our sense of reality and life.	2004-10-14

I found it remarkable . It showed in a deeper way than any other research I had seen the connection between the lives of the philosophers and their thought.<br /><br />I will give just one telling example. Scharfstein discovered that most of the great philosophers had lost at least one parent at a very early age. The need to think deeply about the world, to understand the meaning of it all, relates certainly to that early and great loss.<br /><br />This work is illuminating throughout and recommended to any real lover of philosophy, of trying to understand the world.	2004-10-14

He was also the ardent champion of Israel in the international arena as it strove towards statehood and recognition. This book is a record of his life and struggle, and it is told with great insightfulness and a certain restrained humor of the kind he was known for. I found most moving the childhood story of his grandfather's educating him in Jewish learning, and how he orphaned from his father made his way by his own abilities as a student through Cambridge . His decision to forego what would have certainly been a great academic career and devote himself to the service of the Jewish people, marks the major decision of his life. The book becomes truly exciting when he tells the story of how Israel in the pre- state and early state period made its way forward.<br /><br />Eban's story and the story of Israel taken together make this work an especially interesting one. But there is an additional element. Eban was not only a first- rate diplomat he was in a sense as his later books would show a ' philospher of diplomacy' And there are numerous invaluable insights in this regard, as well as vivid portraits of many of the significant personalities Eban encounters on his way.<br /><br />A truly great autobiography.	2004-10-14

It is the Wisdom which knows when there can be no Wisdom , and the Wisdom which knows that Wisdom too has a time and a season. Robert Gordis gives a general interpretation of Koholet , tries to read for us some of its problematic passages. He is a sympathetic and very understanding commentator.<br /><br />As one who is not a Biblical scholar and cannot pretend expertise on the subject I found his insights extended my own perceptions, and took me to places I could not go myself. My love of Kohelet is so deep and comes from my childhood reading and rereading of the Bible. It seemed to me always to be the book which says the hardest truths about life in the most beautiful and consoling ways. Passages of it are with me every day as I walk and think, passages from the St. James translation in English and passages too in Hebrew. It is not I can assure you ' vanity of vanities ' to read this book, for though the making of many books may be a ' weariness of the flesh' some of these books give us a sense of love of life, even when they are most critical of it.<br /><br />This book helps us read ' Kohelet' but of course the greatest and truest reading is for us to read Kohelet again and again throughout our lives .	2004-10-14

The whole story of the first stagings of ' Death of a Salesman'is a truly fascinating one. One of the major problems of the work for me however was that Miller could supply tremendous detail and also insight about people without really probing inwardly very deeply . I also believe he held back a lot of punches, a lot of bitter truth in writing about people closest to him.<br /><br />A great playwright it turns out may be a very good, but not a great autobiographer.	2004-10-13

The story is told with clarity and sympathy . And something is caught of the tone and spirit of the person considered to be ' the greatest talker the English language had ' since Coleridge. Berlin was a person not only of remarkable learning, but of tremendous intellectual enthusiasm. His understanding of how it may be impossible to reconcile ' ultimate value claims' is at the heart of his  championing of liberal democracy. The story is a remarkable one including not simply his climbing to the top of the pole of the English intellectual establishment ( despite his Jewishness) but his able service in the cause of freedom during the Second World War. One of Berlin's great volumes ( edited by his devoted student Henry Hardy)'Personal Impressions' tells of Berlin's warm friendships with many of the greats of the twentienth century. One such friendship was with Chaim Weizmann first President of Israel. Berlin was a 'Yom Kippur Jew' and ardent Zionist who contributed much to Israel . On a recent walk on Keren Ha- Yesod street in Jerusalem I took special pleasure in seeing a quiet little square named after him. This book should be an introduction to reading his own collections of essays which Hardy put together. They are the remarkable record of a most remarkable mind.	2004-10-13

In it he presents his own Covenant theology. He has learned much and provides critiques of two of his great teachers in this work, Rabbi Joseph Dov Ber Soloveitchik and Yehoshua Leibowitz.  Rabbi Hartman places the Covenant at Sinai at the center of Jewish experience. He tends to see this Covenant more in terms of the marital relation, than in the relation of parents and children. And this with the stress he places on responsibility and freedom for humanity. For Rabbi Hartman Torah and Torah learning are the true legacy of Sinai and the message and life- work of the people of Israel. This is a profound work and an inspiring one. And all those interested in thinking deeply about the people of Israel 's relation to G-d would do well to study this work.	2004-10-13

I found it to be a convincing and moving account of a relationship between a decent son and a not- so- decent great- writer father. Zamir's journey to his father, his efforts at befriending him have some success. But IB Singer who is without question one of Literature's greatest writer of stories was not very generous or welcoming. In time their relationship improves and the son translates the father's work into Hebrew. The sense is that the son is simply a very good human being, and the father a very great writer.	2004-10-13

They are among the great works of literature.<br /><br />To describe a Kafka story is to describe something uncanny. It is to describe a transformation into an enigmatic world, where the precise material details of reality suggest other realities one vaguely senses and cannot really understand. It is the dwelling in a strange realm of anxiety and fear beyond the ordinary that can miraculously turn to a different direction entirely.<br /><br />I cannot really say what Kafka's stories are.<br /><br />I only know that whoever reads them will be in the presence of the uniquest of the unique in literature.

They are also however deep in a kind of quiet beauty, a unique language of slightly Yiddishized American colloquial restraint. The title story, and the most famous one tells of the hopes and disappointments of poor Jews seeking to find their ' bashert' their destined mate. It touches upon the world of tormented souls selling illusions to themselves and others. It really moves us with the sense of how the dreams of life turn bitterness into greater bitterness, with longing disappointment beauty.

There is the text of his perhaps most well- known work, \\"Orot\\" and there are letters, essays, and poems. Rabbi Kook was a remarkable poetic thinker, like Pascal, Kafka, Kierkegaard, . He was too deeply devout and tremendously learned-a master of commentary in all forms of Jewish sacred Literature. His writing is often difficult to understand as it is so richly poetic.<br /><br />But behind it all is a philosophical system based on his reading of the Torah, a system which sees the Cosmos as a whole moving toward Redemption. And which in this sees the return of the Jewish people to the land of Israel as central to this cosmic process. Rabbi Kook is one of the great religious Zionist thinkers, and his ability to see the good and positive in the works of others, non- religious Jews and non- Jews also make him a philosopher who can speak to us today.<br /><br />This work should certainly be read by every Jew who wishes to understand the Jewish role in history. It should also be read by every human being who wishes to come in touch with the work of an inspiring thinker with a message of love and redemption for all of mankind.	2004-10-12

It is written with a clear affection for the Arab world and by one who had many good Arab friends. It helps explain much behavior which those of us who came to the Middle East in our adult years found puzzling.<br /><br />One major example of this concerns the Arab relation to ' truth' The Arabs according to Patai do not have a concept of objective truth in the way Westerners do. The Arabs in general tell people what they believe others want to hear. This makes them excellent propagandists. They also themselves tend to live very much in a world of wishful thinking. Thus Arabs have difficulty taking responsibility for their own faults , and in general tend to look to blame others. For instance the whole story of their failure in modernization is told by them as the responsibility of the colonial imperial West. This is the line by the way taken in the academy even today by Arab apologists, most notably the late Edward Said. Patai shows how the flight from responsibility also has its damaging effect on Arab political life. He shows too how the endless conflicts within and between Arabs are inherent in the familial relations in the society.<br /><br />Patai has many positive things to say about Arab values such as hospitality, generosity to guests, family concern. But above all his book explains to the reader why the Arab world today constitutes such a great problem to itself and to others.<br /><br />The lack of tolerance for the beliefs of others, the inability to honestly criticize themselves , the male chauvinism and repression of female abilities all lead to the backwardness. And from the backwardness comes too those abhorrent forms of violence which unfortunately seem to be ( not as Patai hoped in 1983 when he wrote the book , diminishing) but rather increasing.	2004-10-12

It is a book of the triumph of the human spirit. It tells of a white mother who married two different black men , and had twelve children. It tells of her dedication to them, her raising them to be value education .And her raising them above all to be good human beings.<br /><br />The author writes with a great love and understanding of his mother, and the difficulty of her struggle. He writes without cliche and with a very good feeling for language.<br /><br />Though I as a religious Jew see something wrong in his mother's decision to leave her faith and become a Christian, I also understand how her Jewish education was central in the values of learning she imparted to her children. I also understand how coming from a situation of being unloved she sought to make a family in which there would be what she lacked.<br /><br />On a purely human level this is a tremendously powerful book, and most highly recommended.	2004-10-11

The murder of Daniel Pearl simply because he was Jewish would seem to take us back into the darkest times of Jewish and human history, to the Nazi era. And in truth the new Islamic Fundamentalism in whose name Pearl was murdered is a frightening and abhorrent phenomenom which is a threat to human civilization and freedom as a whole.<br /><br />Pearl's last words ' My father is a Jew. My mother is a Jew . I am a Jew' are as I understand it a courageous affirmation of his own identity and connection with his people. It connects with generations of Jewish martyrs who died on ' Kiddush Hashem' crying out as their last words the Jewish declaration of faith in G-d, \\" Shema Yisrael\\"<br /><br />The book itself consists in around one- hundred and fifty personal statements by largely well- known Jews about what being Jewish means to them. The selection to my taste is a little slanted to the ' left and to the Diaspora' and should in my opinion have had more Israelis, and more with a strong religious identity. There are a few who I would not have included. But on the whole the selection is varied, interesting and provides a great deal of meaningful thought. I especially was touched by the words of Kerri Strug the courageous Olympic gymnast but there are many other inspiring accounts also.<br /><br />This is an important book for anyone who wishes to see the collective face of the Jewish people at this time.	2004-10-11

And he writes informatively about the struggle of the modern state of Israel to come into being.<br /><br />As a citizen of Israel and as a believing Jew I cannot help but feel a depth of gratitude to a non- Jew who has given so much effort, and has worked with such dedication and brilliance to present this positive and uplifting view of Jewish history.	2004-10-11

It traces a family of such Just Men through generations of suffering, and climaxes with Ernie Levy, the Last of the Just whose sufferings in the Shoah( Holocaust) bring the story to a climax and an end. The powerful and painfully poetic conclusion of this story is one of the most moving in Literature. In one sense it might be said that the work presents a one- sided view of  Jewish history. But it does tell the story of Jewish suffering through the generations and in the Shoah with incredible compassion and feeling. And it arouses in the reader too a deep identification and sympathy with that history, and with the story and ongoing life of the Jewish people.	2004-10-10

Oz does a good job of listening sympathetically and narrating the stories and complaints of those he meets. One especially powerful meeting occurs in a development town where those of the ' second Israel' powerfully spell out their grievances. The writing here is clear and often very moving. Though Oz is of course touted for his fiction it seems to me that this small piece of writing is , to the point he wrote it, his most effective work.	2004-10-10

These diaries contain not only the record of much of his daily anxiety but also many of his brilliant poetic perceptions of the world and of his own mind. There is an uncanny beauty in this work which reminds of the phrase of Emerson crossing Boston Common ' glad to the brink of fear' Kafka in a diary entry spoke of ' writing as prayer ' and it is clear too that Kafka was most alive, and most praying when writing .<br /><br />This work is most highly recommended especially for those who are able to bear the torments and fears involved in the life of creation of one of world literature's great geniuses at work.	2004-10-10

It is a tremendously moving personal account. Where she is especially insightful , and I believe will give understanding to many who have no direct experience of the subject is in her description of her ' manic times'. No one has not seen a truly manic person in all their strange power and often charm and strength can understand how difficult and painful the ' up side' can be. Kate Jamison tells her own story with great narrative skill . She is just a wonderful writer, illness or no illness. She gets in this book to depths of feeling and understanding which no other non- fiction work I know approaches.<br /><br />This book could not be more recommended.<br /><br />However I would caution the reader, that however romantic this disorder might seem it is truly not that at all, and truly a place you should never want to be.<br /><br />One important and hopeful point is Kay Jamison's own example of with all the suffering still achieving much in her life. The greatest manic- depressive I have ever known did this also. And he too had a tremendous power of poetry and language so beyond the ordinary as to move you with his slightest utterance. Though he said ' no a thousand times no' many many times he also on his good days and when he was not too high could make you laugh and cry and even love life as this book also does.	2004-10-10

It explores in great details the lives of a wide variety of Israelis, and gives much inside information on the society. It gives very sympathetic and understanding portraits of the victims of terror. And it shows a  basic understanding of the complex social reality of Israel.<br /><br />It does however it seem to fall short in its ultimate political judgment and wisdom, with its endorsement of a two- state solution that might be disastrous for Israel. .It is also perhaps not completely fair and understanding of the Jewish religious public in Israel.<br /><br />Nonetheless there is no other book I can think of which puts the reader more directly in contact with so many different Israelis from so many different walks of life. And it thus presents something of the complexity of Israeli life which is ordinarily absent in cliche and cardboard presentations of it in the mass media.	2004-10-09

In the course of this he reveals how the redemption of the Jewish people is necessarily bound up with the land of Israel. He too speaks of the heretofore unrealized aspects of the Covenantal Promise, the restoration of the Beit HaMikdash and the rulership of the Sanhedrin.<br /><br />Anyone who loves Israel and the Jewish people can take heart and learn much from the ideas of this very profound work.	2004-10-09

In the I-It relationship we treat others as objects and make use of them for our own selfish purposes. In the I - Thou relationship we treat others with full respect, and seek to understand their inwardness as we understand our own. In the I- Thou relationship as Buber conceives it true dialogue and true relationship is possible. And in this kind of meaningful relationship between two understanding and empathetic human beings we come into a kind of holy relationship. And this kind of holy human relationship parallels the proper relationship we are to have with God.<br /><br />While this single idea might seem too all encompassing to really analyze the complexity of our human relationships, I believe it is a basically right guiding concept.<br /><br />Buber in this short work sets out his theoretical understanding of the concept. Buber is ordinarily a clear writer, and a remarkable storyteller as in his 'Tales of the Hasidism' work. But here the theoretical structure means that there is much abstraction often difficult to understand. Philosophy meets poetry here but not always in a readily comprehensible way.<br /><br />But again this is the key concept of a major thinker, and a concept which illuminate the path for each of us to a better and more humanly fulfilling life.	2004-10-09

In one way it is an adventure story about whaling .In another way it is an encyclopedia that will tell you more than you want to know about the whole business of whaling. In a third way it is a story of revenge of the main character Captain Ahab's desire to ' revenge himself upon a dumb creature' who in a previous voyage was responsible for the Captain's loss of his leg. In yet another way it is the story of the whole human race as Melville gives descriptions of a great variety of characters of different nations and races. It is still another way it is about the whole question of the meaning of the universe, a question which is really investigated in the subject of \\" The Whiteness of the Whale\\" It is yet another way it is the portrait of American society at a certain time of its development. It too is many other things, including a drama in which conflicting characters play out their own special roles. One of the major delights of Moby Dick is its language which is so rich and so filled with interesting metaphorical language .The book is very long and it has long boring stretches and at times you may wonder what has happened to the plot , and if there is any really. But in the end the great adventure story does come to a remarkable and in some ways enigmatic solution.<br /><br />It is a challenge to read Moby Dick as it is to read all great literature. But in taking on you will develop your own powers of understanding and observation. So I suggest you go with it all the way to the end. And once you have done that maybe ' War and Peace' is next.	2004-10-08

Fukuyama took the world by storm by seeing it as sign of an inevitable triumph of liberal democracy. For a time it appeared to some that he might be right. But as he was now fifteen years later see a world torn apart by radical Islamic terrorism, a world in which tribal loyalties increasingly surface as most important, a world in which the possibilities of terror and destruction multiply exponentially with the perfection of Technology Fukuyama's thesis seems a Utopian kind of ivory - tower dream. Fukuyama is a tremendously learned, intelligent and skillful master of his argument- but the argument itself and the fundamental thesis has gone the way of so many other ' inevitability theories' We could conceivably all go down in a second of doom brought on by any of a number of different human and non- humanly generated events. Liberal democracy may well be the best kind of government Mankind has ever known but it certainly does not seem bound to conquer necessarily the masses of mankind, even as now when certain very large portions of mankind, China, for instance are moving ahead by leaps and bounds economically.<br /><br />This is a tremendously thought- provoking work, and highly recommended.

It tells the stories of his remarkable life in teaching, in prayer, in Tsedakah and in giving to others. One of his greatest pupils the Holy Teacher David Herzberg Z\\"l related many stories similar to the ones here in which Shlomo dedicated all his time and all his money unceasingly to helping others. There is a story that at the funeral of Shlomo Carlebach among the many people crying was one who shouted , \\"Shlomo , you were the only one who ever loved me\\" For so many of the lonely and broken of this world Shlomo Carlebach was there. This book gives so many remarkable examples of this that it is a treasure not only in Jewish example and teaching but of how human love and caring enriches us all.	2004-10-06

Scholem was the great pioneer in the field. He opened up the mystical texts to serious scholarly investigation after they were ignored by more as it were ' rationalistic ' scholars. In doing so he connects us with a remarkable tradition and group of thinkers who contemplate the human divine relationship with utmost intensity and seriousness. One of the more interesting points for me was Scholem's distinction of Jewish Mysticism from other mainstream mysticisms, the central idea that for the Jewish Mysticism G-d can be approached , and must be approached as closely as possible but cannot be wholly unified with. i.e. that for the Jewish mystic some Transcendent dimension must always remain outside which the human can never come. I also greatly appreciated Scholem's meditations on the effect of Lurianic Kabbalah on Jewish history. And in this sense Scholem's own sense of the Jewish people's return to history as not involving an immediate and final demand for its end, but a  place in its ongoing development. This brief review does not do justice to the richness of the concepts invoked and explained in the work, nor the scope of the thought. Rather it touches the points which most touched me.<br /><br />The joy of intellectual adventure at the highest levels awaits the reader of this work.	2004-10-06

The life example is the teaching, and the teaching is of an attempt to inwardly relate to God, and live his life as life of total dedication to God.<br /><br />One does not have to be a Christian to be moved by the example, by the great power of mind, by the sense of play with literary forms, by the gift of language, by the originality in thought, and by the unique way of making his own story into literature.	2004-10-04

It gave me a deeper understanding of the suffering of the Jews in the Shoah( Holocaust) than any other book I had read on the subject. It is powerfully, poetically and painfully written. It in telling the story of one person, and one family seems to speak for  millions murdered by the Nazis. It tells how the innocent, dreaming youth lost in the spiritual world of a small Eastern European shtetl is confronted with absolute Evil and Cruelty. It tells the story of his passage through death camps and on the death march. It tells of his relation to his family, and his especially painful parting from his beloved father. And it raises questions about the Nature of Man, of Evil, of Human Suffering. And it is an address to G-d in questioning in the deepest way. Like Job and like the Psalmist the young narrator dares to speak to G-d and reveal his own most powerful doubts and questions. The story is one which too portrays the victims with a kind of love, sympathy and understanding.<br /><br />My summary does not even begin to do justice to this very great work.<br /><br />I have only one warning word to the reader. To read this work is painful and difficult, and it raises questions for which some may have no answer but ultimate despair.

He does this with a convincing mix of solid historical information and persuasive analytical argument. He moreover in doing this exposes one of the major ironies, and injustices of world political life i.e. that democratic Israel is continually attacked for offenses that its non- democratic enemies continually make against it. One promiment such example of course is in the war against Palestinian terror. Dershowitz shows how Israel is perhaps the most conscienscious country in the world in the limits it places on the actions of its soldiers in regard to hostile civilians. He shows how the Israeli Supreme Court goes out of its way, often to the chagrin of Israeli society as a whole, to defend the civil rights of Israel's enemies. He shows how the cruel Palestinian suicide terrorists who have no respect for human lives are let off scot free in the court of the world, the UN  while Israel is continually blamed for actions in which its sole aim is to defend its civilians. Dershowitz is very good on the whole historical question of the Jewish return to the land of their ancestors, a return to a largely barren land. He shows how the unrelenting hostility of the Arab world has led to their repeated humiliation. And he is hopeful and supportive of the idea of a territorial compromise in which there would be a Jewish and an Arab state in the land West of the Jordan. Unfortunately here he goes too far in acceding to both world opinion and Arab wishes, as events not only historically but especially since the Oslo agreement and most especially since the violence that the Palestinians initiated in Sept. 2000 suggest that an Arab state west of the Jordan would constitute a mortal danger to Israel.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book, and most especially to those instinctive supporters of Israel who are often baffled by the charges made against it.

It is the story of Tommy Wilhelm a divorced father of two, a former actor , a self- perceived failure as he puts his life bit of money and trust in the truthteller- imposter Dr. Temkin. But the work also catches perfectly the idiom of West Side New York American business life, of a civilization money- driven. It is a richly ironic work with brilliant portraits of minor characters. It tells convincingly of the heartbreak of middle - aged disappointment in a success- measuring civilization. And it does this with a depiction of its central character which is always deep and moving. The book comes to its end in a funeral scene in which self- pitying Wilhelm ( Wilky) mourns with all his soul for himself, and leads us to mourn for him, and for each and every frail mortal who has known most deeply their own failure. What a richness of Yiddish- American idiom and truth of life there is in this compact and beautiful work.	2004-09-22

It provides sensible discussions of incredible dangers that most of us do not think about most of the time. It is also reasonable in understanding that the nuclear threat has not vanished with the fall of the Soviet Union but has rather transformed. It too presents a picture of possible survival through colonization of other worlds. And it proposes a whole set of possibilities of transformation of humanity into some other form of being which would make our cosmic survival more likely. Its focus however is in discussing the kinds of dangers human tampering with nature and environment bring to the future.<br /><br />The  hopelessness which I personally felt in reading the work comes not only from the possibility that one of the ' doom scenarios' might be realized. It is rather from the strong feeling which Rees is not alone in presenting, that we human beings as we are, are only a temporary stage which will necessarily be transformed into some other more durable, more intelligent kind of ' thing.' I find that this approach undermines the central value of the 'human'as we know it. Human life,individual human beings, human relations in all their complexity, the human relation to the Divine seem to me to be more precious and holy,  than our ' survival ' as another ' form of being'. This book is frightening in its negative prospects but too does not console in the picture of the non- human human future, it gives.	2004-09-21

The reading is pure pleasure at least on the aesthetic level. The difficult story of the decline of a civilization, and its failure to meet the challenges of the modern world is told here with human sympathy and intelligent irony. How Islam fell behind the Christian West, and how it was passed by without even knowing it at times is the major theme of this work . What the reader comes to understand as it draws to its close is that the backwardness of this world has become structural and deeply embedded in it. And that therefore the violence and terror which the US woke up to on 9/11 is not about to suddenly pass from the world. The resentment and frustration of the Islamic world are powerful forces pushing it to continual confrontation with the West. Lewis provides insight into the scientific, technical failings of a civilization too deeply devoted to its own insular focus on its own holy texts. He does not give the sense that the democratization of this world is about to soon come about, or that the problems created by its general attitude are soon to go away.	2004-09-19

His stories are filled with incredible energy and life. Demonic lust drives many characters, and one of the reasons he is much loved is his seeming modern depiction of characters who come from the old world, the world of Jewish Poland . But the stories I most love are ones in which a power of beneficence overwhelms in some surprising way. The great Gimpel the Fool is one example of this, the story of the cuckold the eternal innocent and believer who knows once he stops believing in his wife he will stop believing in God and the goodness of the world. Another of these great stories is the Little Shoemakers with its tale of successive generations in old world and new continuing the family trade despite the loss and transformation in tradition time brings. Another of this kind of great story is the 'Spinoza of Market Street' with its revelation of an unexpected love. The list is long of very great and moving stories.Singer is a master- teller who can be stark and frightening at times but gives that sense the great writers' do , of life in literature as something deeply deeply meaningful. Who reads this book will taste life deeply and more deeply love it.	2004-07-19

The story of the transition from world to world, from the Poland of her  childhood to the Canada of the latter part of her youth, and young adulthood is too told as the story of a family ` lost in translation'. On the purely human individual level there is an exceptional story told here by an exceptional story - teller. There are too a number of remarkably moving scenes , I think especially of her re-meeting the love of her Polish childhood, and the kind of understanding they have for each other though they now live cultures away.<br />  I nonetheless found a certain absence in the work, an absence in the making as end of the story real human connection beyond that given in childhood and early years. Every writer as Henry James has his ` donnee' the subject and material which he is given, and is not to be criticized for having. Eva Hoffman's is this lostness in translation, this perpetual not- at- homeness, but it nonetheless makes of her story at least to my mind , one which however successful on the purely literary level presents a life lacking in the higher significance of giving to and being with others.	2004-07-13

This revival has one major source, the hatred of Israel being preached throughout the Arab and to a degree the Islamic world, a hatred which has been adopted by the Left in the West. This new anti- Semitism combines with the ' old European Fascist Anti- Semitism' which many wanted to think had disappeared with the defeat of the Nazis.<br />Instead we see a new improbable combination of Extreme Right and Extreme Left.<br />In this collection of fifty essays a good share of which are of very high quality a very serious exploration of this anti- Semitism is made. The book contains the work of the most respected people working in various areas, such as Bernard Lewis surveying the world of Islam's Anti- Semitism ,Paul Berman and Melanie Philips looking at New- Left Anti- Semitism, Dr.David Zangen an eyewitness telling of the blood- libel in the alleged Jenin massacre, Gabriel Schoenfeld on Israel and the Anti- Semites,Ruth Wisse on the consequences of ignoring Anti- Semitism.<br />The supposed seed of this work was Rosenbaum's reading Philip Roth's ' Operation Shylock' and considering the possibility of a 'Second Holocaust' And it is clear, and I am not sure that this is explored fully enough in this volume that the real aim of Arab Anti- Semitism anyway is the delegitimization of Israel that would lead to its destruction. In other words the new Anti-Semitism does not like the Nazi- brand focus on killing every Jew everywhere in the hope of eliminating Jews completely from the world. Its real aim is to eliminate the Jewish state, and in so doing eliminate the Jews from any place of their own in the world, and any power of their own in History.<br />This collection contains a great deal .It is not complete. And there are articles I would not have included. ( I do not really think it makes sense to give a hearing to those who wish to somewhat hypocritically tell the world how wonderful Jews they are in opposing the Jewish state) On the whole however a first rate work which calls attention to one of our time's most important moral questions not only for Jews but for mankind.mewhat hypocritically tell the world how wonderful Jews they are in opposing the Jewish state) On the whole however a first rate work which calls attention to one of our time's most important moral questions not only for Jews but for mankind.	2004-07-12

One of the major elements and this should be kept in mind by Western leaders today is that Churchill even in the darkest hours would not placate and negotiate with Evil. The word 'Defeat' was simply not part of his strategic vocabulary. His indomitable spirit influenced all those around him.<br />This does not mean as Gilbert makes clear that Churchill did not have his doubts, his despairs, his periods of anger and frustration. But always he was able to overcome , and to keep the main goal, the defeat of the enemy before his eyes. His remarkable courage and his great ability to inspire others , combined with his thorough, responsible and comprehensive intellect helped  make him the outstanding political leader of the twentieth century. Whether at the darkest hour of retreat at Dunkirk or in the moments of great relief and victory Churchill made himself the living embodiment of the spirit of the people, the salty and courageously defiant British  people he led and loved.<br />Gilbert is a master of condensation, of wise judgment in writing. He has done all those who care about the subject of Leadership a very real service with this small in size, but great in meaning, work.	2004-07-11

Cushing Strout is a man of immense and diverse learning. His writing<br /> has a grace , intelligence and eloquence which moves deeply. He is at home in diverse worlds, and makes of those diverse worlds, history, biography, literature, art and architecture integral readings in the world of the mind. Known first of all for his pioneering study on  Becker and Beard's economic readings of Constitutional History,  he throughout his scholarly life has extended his range of knowledge and interest. Perhaps the figure closest to him and one he has written with great insight is William James. In his remarkable essay ' The Unfinished Arch'  Strout showed how the one element and area missing in the great American psychologist and philosopher's work was a deep reading of history.<br /> The world of interests displayed in these essays is very broad . Among the themes he has written about with most insightfulness are the relation of the makers of  Culture in  the New World to their heritage in the  Old, the practice and theory of psycho- history, the connection between Literature, Politics  and History.  Never having looked to reveal a single systematic theory of how everything connects with everything else , he has rather found and made profound truths through celebration of life's variety in truth . Both as a scholar and a writer Professor Strout has always shown t a real feeling for narrative. His scholarly essays make the word of the mind into stories which are suspenseful and dramatic. This  collection of essays mirrors the mind of this great scholar, and is a true representation of his work. It could not possibly be more highly recommended . (...)	2004-07-10

Rabbi Telushkin's great learning is complemented by his warm and down- to- earth approach. He supplies examples from everyday life that instruct us as to the right and moral way to act. He does this out of what is revealed to be a profound Jewish faith and understanding.<br />If I have one criticism of this book it is not that it so American - centered but rather that it is so diaspora- centered, and thus does not include consideration of very different kinds of moral challenges Jews in Israel have to face.

It considers in separate chapters the work that is being done to increase human performance- level in sport, to as it were `produce better children', to prolong and increase the quality of human life, and to bring us closer to ` human happiness'. The tone of this work is measured and responsible, the information presented that which has been weighed and tested. Above all in considering each of these areas the debate is carried on with a broad- minded and deep consideration of the meaning of what it is to be human. Thus there is neither the ` gung-ho' utopianism of certain kinds of over- optimistic futurists, nor the paralyzing pessimism of various over- protectors of their own narrow conceptions of the human past. In each of the areas a balanced discussion provides the reader, not with definite and final answers to the problems and possibilities raised, but with suggestions for thought.<br />  We have long since learned that scientific and technological advances usually have their ` price' in one way or another. Here trade-offs in the various areas are made explicit. The new technology which enables us to decide upon the sex of the child has already let to tremendous imbalances in among other areas, the populations of China and India. The prolonging of life is in many cases the prolonging of what seems to be senseless suffering. The ability to enhance moods through chemical means raises the question of what happiness means when it is devoid of the context of human relationship. The possibility of prolonging life indefinitely raises the question of what this might mean for future generations , and the whole spirit of renewal that the birth of a new generation gives to the world.<br />  Leon Kass a moral thinker of the first order, and the director of this enterprise has often been unjustly accused of being a ' super- conservative' and even' fundamentalist'.

It seems to me that his position is much closer to that of what might be called a traditional liberal meliorist, who is looking to see how the human condition can be improved without those improvements leading to its radical undermining. His understanding in this sense of the place of the family and of human relations in the good life, and in happiness starkly contrast him with those ivory- tower ` transhumanists' and ` cyber- champions' who would replace mankind with their own solipsistic minds.<br />  This is an important work not for its definite conclusions but for the serious contribution it makes to the ongoing quest of humanity to understand itself and define and realize its varying conceptions of the good life.nterprise has often been unjustly accused of being a ' super- conservative' and even' fundamentalist'.

I would instead consider most closely those sections in which he seeks to define the American creed and identity. As is to be expected he brings to this work a lifetime of studying the area, a tremendous richness of knowledge, and a formidable power of analysis. He shows the unique and prominent place religion has in American life, and traces much of the American ethic to those dissident Protestant sects whose individualism, hardworking independence provided the fundaments of the American creed. He gives the reader a very strong sense of the unique blessing of the American experience, and of America's unique way of defining itself as a city upon a hill, a great experiment and gift to all of Mankind. He writes he says as an unabashed American patriot concerned about the future of his country . And he is troubled that there may emerge a Spanish speaking state within a state , one which longs to be rejoined to Mexico, one which does not have those values of hard- work, and striving for a better future that have been so central a part of the American experience.<br />I myself read and enjoyed this book as a kind of re- education in the way Americans have thought of themselves. As to the central problem Huntington touches upon I think it part of a larger complex of problems our technologically driven world faces , problems that are not unique to America. These problems concerning our fundamental identity as human beings are I believe intensely felt in America today. I am not sure the answer to them is in America's refocusing on the Anglo- Protestant heritage as Huntington recommends. What I do recommend however is reading and enjoying this always interesting and intelligent work of a first- rate American mind.elligent work of a first- rate American mind.	2004-06-29

Reading and meeting again the mind of Bernard Lewis in \\"From Babel to Dragomans\\" is such a pleasure.<br />  Collected in this work are essays of one of the great intellectual figures of this past half - century. Arguably the world's foremost authority on the Middle East ( and most especially the Ottoman Empire) Lewis in these essays displays not only a vast learning but a civilized and often quietly humorous writing which continually inform and delight. In the title essay he elucidates the concept of the ` dragoman' or ` meturgaman' the translator and in so doing also helps us better understand the way societies which contained within themselves a rich variety of cultures and languages operated . In his remarkable essay \\" A Taxonomy of Hatred\\" he gives perhaps the most skilled argument I have ever seen for valuing and considering ` the other'. And this as he analyzes and explains how the instinctual hatred that seems to come to us naturally as primates is refined into something more elegant and deadly in human civilizations. As one who has been involved in the study of the Islamic world for over sixty years he brings a fine sense of the transformations that world has gone through in his lifetime while balancing this against what seem almost inherent cultural patterns these societies cannot free themselves of . His analysis of the distinct identity Iran and Iranian civilization managed to preserve after the Arab onslaught swept aside the ancient cultures of Egypt, Syria and other Mid- East regions too enables us to understand the life- struggle that society is going through today between a narrow Islamic based fundamentalism and a broader richer conception of life and civilization.<br />  The book is divided into three large sections, part one dealing with Past History, part two with what he calls \\" Current History\\" and Part Three \\"About History\\" In this latter section he makes a defense of the practice and teaching of history. He concludes , \\"Our education today should be concerned with the development of many cultures, in all their diversity: with the great ideas that inspire them and the texts in which those ideas are enshrined, with the achievements they made possible, and with the common heritage their followers and successors share.<br />  \\"History is the collective memory , the guiding experience of human society, and we all badly need that guidance\\"<br />  In this volume Lewis provides that guidance in a continually inspiring and uplifting way.<br />  Who reads this volume will not only read a civilization , but a  very great man indeed.The book is divided into three large sections, part one dealing with Past History, part two with what he calls \\" Current History\\" and Part Three \\"About History\\" In this latter section he makes a defense of the practice and teaching of history.

Bayley tells the story of their forty - two years of marriage at the same time he describes more closely the four last years in which Iris Murdoch suffered from Alzheimer's. He writes with humor and quiet understanding, and his obvious admiration and love for his wife speak throughout the work.<br />The cruelty of Alzheimer's is somehow underlined when the one who suffers is a person of extraordinary mind , a devotee of the life of the mind . Bayley honestly and painfully portays the strange kind of blankness and absence which the Alzheimer sufferer often displays. He does this against a background of the story of two lives, each of one has been lived in part in the great solitude of outstanding creator endeavor. But he also very good relating their shared experiences.<br />Bayley is also tactful and restrained about a certain assymetry in their relation, relating probably much more to the early years when Iris was involved with others. One nonetheless feels Bayley's restrained anger in his description of the ' master figure ' who for a time seemed to be a center of Murdoch's intellectual life.<br />What however impresses and makes this work remarkable is the steady gaze of love and intelligence with which Bayley sees , envelopes and protects Murdoch . This book is a work of love and pain, and of great beauty. It also provides much valuable insight into that terrible condition when the person is physically present but mentally lost.	2004-06-16

A mosaic of one hundred exemplary creative minds,Fourth Estate, London,2002  25 pounds.<br />  With this book  Harold Bloom reaffirms the place he has already staked out for himself, as the most bold and ambitious literary critic of  our  time. He does this by surveying world literature and selecting from it the one - hundred supreme literary geniuses, and in five or  six  pages for  each discussing what defines the unique genius if  each one.Each chapter has a short frontispiece in which he says something more general about the life and work of  the individual creator, and a larger section in which he reads and interprets a selected piece of  writing of  the particular genius. His analysis and his own writing sparkle with aphoristic brilliance,with deep and broad knowledge, and with a rare capacity to make remarkable new connections between  literary figures and worlds. Above all, the book is pervaded by his love of reading, his love of  great imaginative literature.And the whole work is testament to and evidence of  his total enthusiasm about  and  dedication to this world<br />  Frequently in the work he mentions with a  degree of  modesty which would make Faustus  proud, his knowing by heart  vast sections of  a particular literary masterpiece. This recalling time and again his own memorizing of  particular works, is only one of  the many obsessions which play such a large part in the work.Bloom does not remind repeating himself, tells us over and over again that he is seventy - one, that to his regret he has lived to see the university world taken over by the politically correct. He rails against  those curricula which select writers on basis of  ethnic belonging, gender, race.He does not stop insisting that the great body of  the media world, the popular culture, the university world is involved in nonsense and trivia.He presents himself as  a kind of  romantic hero, defending not only the literary greats he present, but the very idea of  literary greatness, of  genius of  the imagination itself. And thus without declaring it openly, he presents himself as the one hundred and first genius of  the work, the one who has come to rescue all the others.He is the  the reader as genius who has come to save  all the other geniuses from all the postmodern Foucalt - Derrida deriders whose leveling spirit defines the mediocrity of  the age.<br />  What is remarkable is how well Bloom does the work he sets out to do. His writing, line by line, writer by writer is truly alive, thought - provoking and inspiring. Bloom  organizes his geniuses into groups of  ten groups of  ten,each representing a Kabbalistic sphere or realm of emnation.They are then subdivided into groups of  five each of which is called a  ` lustre'. Each lustre  a term he takes from Emerson and Plutarch which  means shining by reflected light,  is meant to hint at the influence the geniuses grouped together have upon each other. This scheme which in one sense seems arbitrary, nonetheless often works to help him make interconnections which are often  surprising and rich.For instance his first section in which he takes five of  the greatest literary geniuses,Shakespeare,Cervantes,Montaigne,Milton  Tolstoy,is called Keter or Crown.It  contains those geniuses each of  which ` dominates his genre forever'Bloom says Shakespeare was influenced by Montaigne and Cervantes,that Milton is ` uneasily ` influenced by Shakespeare,and that Tolstoy who ` hated Shakespeare ` nonethless knew how to in the novel of  his old age, Hadji Murad use his influence in his varied characterizations.<br />  Here it is necessary to point out the special role Shakespeare plays in Bloom's literary world.Shakespeare is not as in Borges words, \\" the one who created the most \\" he is  what for Bloom is most important in literary art,the supreme creator of  character. Hamlet, Lear, Macbeth,Iago,Falstaff, Rosalind,  are fictional characters more memorable more living more immortal, in Bloom's judgment, than most human beings.<br />  The use of  the Sefirot while in one sense artificial nonetheless  enhances the connections  between the various writers and enriches the work.Taken as a whole it gives the suggestion of these literary creators as embodying the whole of  G-d `s creation, the ineffable radiance of  all Being. And this when there is of course the reservation that such creation is by no means complete, as Bloom includes in his list no living author, and of  course, no great authors of  the future. As for the religious implication of the scheme it is clear that in making all the world, the world of  literature Bloom is speaking for himself  as a person who has given all his life to literature, whose religion is the reading of  literature, an odd religion of  one, and of  his own peculiar greatness.<br />  An alternative reading would see all these literary creators not necessarily in heroic rebellion against G-d, but as creators working to complete God's creation. This alternative view that of  normative Judaism,  would see genius as a ` gift of  God . The world each creator makes is one element which is God's, while the characters too, including the authors are also ` creations ` of  God, who enrich and fill up God;s world. Each great creator is an especially chosen servant of God. Each creator  is connected with but cannot contain or exhaust the Source of creative power whose manifestations will continue to surprise us..In this sense the love of  literature,  the love of  reading is simply one particular expression of  God's love for us, and for our capacity to love G-d in return. Literature which enhances life, which gives life meaning and beauty are God's gift to us, which we contribute to  through our own creations.<br />  Bloom's work enhances our love for literature and life. Those  who read this book will have a deeper appreciation  for the place of  reading great literature in life, and for the power and  greatness of  the single individual human being ( in this case, Harold Bloom) the creator of  Genius.  .ing more immortal, in Bloom's judgment, than most human beings. <BR>    The use of  the Sefirot while in one sense artificial nonetheless  enhances the connections  between the various writers and enriches the work.Taken as a whole it gives the suggestion of these literary creators as embodying the whole of  G-d `s creation, the ineffable radiance of  all Being.

It represented the world's most successful example of socialist communal living, a near utopia of democracy and egalitarianism. In Israel itself, hard-working kibbutz members were seen as the 'new Jew,' freed of complexes of the Diaspora. They cultivated the land, were physically strong and independent, and engaged in productive labor.  Kibbutz sons took on more than their share of command positions in the Israeli Defense Forces, where their dedication and sacrifice were an example for the society as a whole.<br />In recent years, however, the kibbutz has, like the socialist and in some cases communist ideology on which much of its principles were based, suffered a great decline. As Israel became a more capitalistic and free-market society, kibbutz ideology seemed outdated and less relevant. The kibbutzim themselves became, in many cases, non-profitable and had to be subsidized by huge government grants. Many of the young people, stultified by their small, closed world, left the kibbutz.  A new political leadership arose in the country that no longer saw the importance of the kibbutz; settlement priorities were elsewhere.  And the kibbutzim themselves evolved, with many of them adopting capitalism and becoming nothing more than bedroom communities.<br />As Israel changed, the general conception that developed was that the kibbutzim have had their day, and no longer have a real place or role in Israeli society.<br />Against this background of kibbutz in crisis and decline, a new light is shed in &quot;The Virtual Kibbutz&quot; (iUniverse, April 2003), by Ellis Shuman, a native of Sioux City, Iowa, who immigrated to Israel in 1972.  Shuman, who served in the IDF, was a founding member of Kibbutz Yahel, and is now Editor-in-Chief of the online daily newmagazine Israel Insider has written a remarkable group of stories centering on encounters in the kibbutz. These stories not only give us much insight into the internal struggles and conflicts of the kibbutz, but they also provide a strong sense of hope and faith that the kibbutz and its members still have a great deal to contribute to Israeli society.<br />In one of the best stories of the collection, &quot;The Clown and the Dancer,&quot; Shuman relates the story of two seemingly opposite figures - the graceful, happy, long-legged dancer Reli, and the short, awkward clown Itzik. Reli, who works as a hospital nurse, takes special care of a seven-year-old boy who was orphaned in a terrorist bombing. After inducing Itzik to come and try and break the shell of grief and silence that has enveloped the boy, Reli and Itzik draw closer, becoming a couple and planning to marry. But in the wake of the terrible suicide bombing in Netanya, during the Pesach Seder, Itzik is called to duty with his army unit to search out terrorists.<br />With quiet, emotional precision, Shuman tells the painful and tragic outcome of the story. In doing so, he also gives a restrained and yet moving account of the difficult life of Israelis in a time of constant terror and daily tragedies. Anyone who wishes to sense not only what life was like in the kibbutz during this time, but in Israel in general, will do well to read this story.<br />In another outstanding story, &quot;The Fence,&quot; we learn of a friendship of many years between kibbutznik Giora, who works his citrus orchard, and his Arab neighbor Ibrahim, who tends his nearby olive grove. The story relates how this unusual friendship is tragically disrupted by the events of the past three years. Shuman again tells the story with a masterful restraint which nonetheless shows great human sympathy.<br />In other stories like the opening &quot;Searching for Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;A Cow's Tale&quot; (about a kibbutnik who develops strong emotional connection with one particular cow in the kibbutz dairy farm), Shuman shows a light and humorous side.  In other stories, he describes kibbutzniks trying to adjust to their changed circumstances - a younger generation looking to adapt with the times and an older disheartened by the betrayal of its socialist ideals.<br />This central theme is explored in the long story &quot;Requiem for a Dream,&quot; but is most powerfully developed in one of the best, and shortest stories of the collection.  In &quot;The Receding Shoreline,&quot; a kibbutz pioneer writes to his brother the story of his disappointment after fifty- three years on the kibbutz.  &quot;My dear brother, I cannot begin to describe the humiliation I feel. Once, when you were here with me, I was accepted as a pioneer, a founder of the kibbutz. Now I am considered nothing more than a burden, someone whose opinions, ideology and feelings no longer account for anything. I stood up against the change that was being forced upon my community and me; I swear I fought with all my might. I stood nearly all alone in the battle watching my dreams collapse around me.&quot;<br />But the mood of disappointment in this story is countered in the closing story, &quot;A Balanced Picture,&quot; where a journalist tries to balance the gloomy, one-sided picture of kibbutz decline her television boss wishes to present sensationally to her audience. In meeting with a group called Equality Initiative, the journalist learns of an effort to introduce positive changes in the kibbutz without breaking its socialist framework. &quot;Not every change comes at the expense of breaking the partnership of the cooperative community... Realistically speaking, there will be some kibbutzim that will cross the red line and change into communities that will no longer be defined as kibbutzim. In Israel, there are many types of communal settlements - kibbutz and moshav are but two examples. But while some kibbutzim may evolve into a different type of community, others will institute changes without crossing these lines.&quot;<br />This story leaves the reader with the feeling that the kibbutz will continue to play a positive role in the Israeli landscape.<br />Aside from the general depiction of the situation of the kibbutz now against its historical background, Shuman furnishes us with vital portraits of idealistic people, of struggling human beings who have a strong element of decency and desire to help their fellow human beings.<br />&quot;cular cow in the kibbutz dairy farm), Shuman shows a light and humorous side.

But there is the same kind of reasoned and measured thought, this time about the very nature of what it means to be human, and the threats to our humanity posed by our own technological innovations.<br />It seems to me that Fukuyama touches on only a share of the problems involved with the question. And  I believe he could be helped had he relied on the Jewish conception , that human beings are creators creating in the image of the Creator and therefore constantly recreating themselves. i.e. by the conception that the essence of Mankind is in transcending our past humanity to create our next stage of development. In any case this is an important book for anyone who would understand the problems Humanity is facing today in regard to its own essence and future.	2004-03-28
