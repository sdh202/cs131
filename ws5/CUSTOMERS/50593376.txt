It is a classic of the genre and the progenitor of countless imitations. It is also a bit like an extravagant work of confectionary--it is great for its few passing moments, it may even haunt your palette for some time, but ultimately--so what?<br /><br />Ms. Du Maurier is a master of the well turned phrase to be sure. Just read the book's opening lines. The ever-tightening web of suffocation that she weaves is truly impressive.<br /><br />Still, Rebecca is no lasting masterpiece. If it is the mentally haunting effect of the work that you crave, let me suggest you turn instead to the Man Who Was Thursday by Chesteron or any of the novels of Charles Williams. If you are a devotee of the well turned phrase, Austen, or even Shirley Jackson, is more effective.<br /><br />All in all, Rebecca dwells in the borderland between a 3 and a 4 star book.<br /><br />A classic? Yes. Due to its impact on subsequent writers.<br /><br />A masterpiece? I had dreamt a little more of Manderley than I found there.	2005-09-22

I read this book while under the influence of a nasty virus. I couldn't sleep.<br /><br />I should have whiled away the time with something else.You are hallucinagenic enough when the fever is raging--no need to throw this book on the blaze.<br /><br />The Haunting of Hill House is a lot like Shirley Jackson's shorter works. It is impressionistic, dancing in parts, dead-on in description and somehow hyper-real amidst all its unreality. It also kind of winds down, rather than concluding.<br /><br />I realize that this description doesn't help you as a prospective buyer.<br /><br />Vote me down if you must.<br /><br />But let me tell you why you should read, if not buy this book:<br /><br />It, and its author, like the works of Stoker, Tolkien, Verne, Wells, and yes--we must not forget him--Seuss, have spawned a thousand other works. If you want to read modern Horror and psychological fiction, you best include this on your list. It will enrich your reading of what has followed.<br /><br />Numerous authors and screen-writers have been downright larcenous with Ms Jackson's little book. It would be a stretch to call it a classic, but it is interesting--even worthwhile.<br /><br />Just don't read it at 2 in the morning when you are not feeling altogehter well.<br /><br />I recommend this book.	2005-09-12

Though perhaps not Dracula or Rebecca, Ridley Pearson's The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer is an engrossing, claustrophobic masterpiece. On one level a mannered drama of life at the turn of the last century, and on another a psychological and supernatural thriller, it is amazing that this fictional stew simmers and finally boils in the way that it does.<br /><br />It is even more amazing that this book is, at its core, a TV-movie tie-in.<br /><br />The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer does owe quite a lot to the aforementioned Rebecca: the young socialite aspiring for true love, the house with echoes of a troubled past (or in this case troubled beginnings and a deeper, darker pre-history), the unhinging of dreams.<br /><br />I would say that The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer is a far fairer child (though admittedly wicked) of Rebecca than anything that Du Maurier subsequently penned.<br /><br />This book stands beautifully on its own--though if you enjoy it, you owe it to yourself to sit down and watch Rose Red.<br /><br />There are dark things in the corners of both Rose Red and this book. All the same, if horror/suspense is your cup of tea, then you cannot go wrong here.<br /><br />I give The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer a solid recommendation.	2005-06-20

A few years back, Mr. Heaney (an excellent poet in his own right) caused quite a stir with his stunning translation of Beowulf. My own reactions to that work were mixed. But who would have thought an Old English war epic/elegy would prove so commercially successful?<br /><br />Now comes an outstanding \\"translation\\" of Sophocles's Antigone--\\"The Burial at Thebes.\\" I first came across this work in excerpted form in Tin House (a literary journal--one of the best actually). This book far exceeds what Mr. Heaney did with Beowulf.<br /><br />Yet the crickets are chirping.<br /><br />It is incomprehensible to me as to why this deeply abiding and thoughtful little book has not blown away the sales and notoriety of the Beowulf volume. Whereas Heaney's Beowulf was clearly a labor of deep interest to the translator--a skillfull and intriguing update of the language for the 21st century, The Burial at Thebes is just as clearly a work of love on behalf of the author...I mean translator--a satirical, lyrical, and prophetic work of the highest order that speaks directly to our world today.<br /><br />I could not put this play--this hymn to all that we are as humans, this song of our identity as individuals--not mere components of a state--down.<br /><br />Antigone's early question/indictment of her sister's complacency rings out like a bell against the twin idols of false patriotism and corporate globalisation:<br /><br />\\"Are we sister, sister, brother<br />Or coward, coward, traitor?\\"<br /><br />What follows is a heroic tragedy. Not heoric in the way the Iliad or the Odyssey are (weapons, war, dust, funeral pyres and great feasts of blood), but heroic in the greatest sense (to know who you are and what is truly worth dying for).<br /><br />Homer and much of the rest of the world sing of war. Sophocles, and his interpreter Heaney, sing of another kind of war--the war of being human in the deepest, richest, and often most tragic, yet inspiring way.<br /><br />I give \\"The Burial at Thebes\\" my highest recommendation.<br /><br />(If you are interested in a great traditional translation to have as a complement to Heaney's, you cannot go wrong with Robert Fagles's translation of the theban plays in the Penguin Classics series).aditional translation to have as a complement to Heaney's, you cannot go wrong with Robert Fagles's translation of the theban plays in the Penguin Classics series).	2005-06-10

We long for the depth and substance of a faith that is intellectually credible, spiritually vibrant, and morally and ethically consistent with what we intuitively know to be right. We long for a good, true, and beautiful spirituality.\\"<br /><br />So says Dick Staub, the author of one great book: \\"Too Christian, Too Pagan,\\" in one of the opening chapters of his latest book: \\"Christian Wisdom of the Jedi Masters.\\"<br /><br />I must admit I was a bit doubtful when I picked up my copy of this book. I LOVED Mr. Staub's last book, and I LOVE the Star Wars movies...but would I love what Mr. Staub would have to say about Christianity as it relates to Star Wars?<br /><br />Before I give you my answer, let me digress for a moment. Let me rail, if I may for one second, against one of the most stupid, avaricious, and least helpful trends in \\"Christian\\" (and God help us all if there is anything Christ-like to the practice) publishing today: the canned \\"Christian\\" response to cultural phenomena in the form of an ill-considered and hastily written book (one need only look at the \\"Christian\\" publishing sub-genre of anti-Harry Potter books to know of what I speak). All too often mistaking a version of \\"Christian\\" sub-culture (or, the \\"Christian\\" ghetto, if you will) for actual Christian doctrine and belief, too many half-wits with a publisher have been allowed--here in 21st century America--to give voice to some of the most spurious, assinine foolishness ever set to paper this side of Mein Kampf.<br /><br />Now that I have the tip of that iceberg out of my system, my answer:<br /><br />Christian Wisdom of the Jedi Masters is not like the other books I just alluded to. I do not feel this was written to make a quick buck off of cultural luddites masquerading as authentic Christ-followers. The great thing about this book is that I believe it was not written for most people who would call themselves Christians at all.<br /><br />Christian Wisdom of the Jedi Masters is a great book that looks at the stories of Star Wars (and some of the Eastern Religions that served Lucas as inspiration in writing them) and compares them to the stories of Christianity. Staub's wealth of knowledge about world religions is evident. Even more powerful is his grasp of how the world's greatest anti-religion (or as some might call it--a relationship)--namely, Christianity, apllies to the lives of people who have looked at Star Wars and seen in it something desirable spiritually.<br /><br />I begin to prattle on though--and over what is really a simple and profound book. Dick Staub has written another MASTERPIECE. I hope that this book's influence extends well beyond a momentary readership of interest during the few months around the release of The Revenge of the Sith.<br /><br />If ever a book called for and deserved a wide readership, it is this one.<br /><br />I give Christian Wisdom of the Jedi Masters a full and heartfelt recommendation.dom of the Jedi Masters is a great book that looks at the stories of Star Wars (and some of the Eastern Religions that served Lucas as inspiration in writing them) and compares them to the stories of Christianity.

I recently got to meet Steven James when he came to hold a couple of seminars at our Church. It was the weekend of Palm Sunday.<br /><br />Being married to a member of our children's ministry staff, I got to go to Dinner with him the night before. To be honest, till I looked at his website the week prior to his appearance at our Church, I'd never heard of the guy before.<br /><br />I was intruiged by what I saw and heard at the seminars. Too often \\"Christian\\" speakers and authors strike me as speakers ansd authors who are called \\"Christian\\" only because their target audience happens to be Christians. This guy appeared genuine.<br /><br />I was further impressed by the fact that Steven also agreed to teach our Kindergartners-3rd Graders their Large Group lesson for all 4 weekend services.<br /><br />What blew me away though, was when we were at dinner and he mentioned that he'd been reading mainly medieval mystics lately. (This was largely encountered by blank looks--something I have grown used to.)<br /><br />No longer did I think that I was the lone Christ-follower on the planet who crossed the borders of what are generally two seperate camps--evangelical Christianity and those who appreciate and find lessons in Christianity's past.<br /><br />So...<br /><br />To make a long story slightly less long, I picked up a copy of Becoming Real. The book is much like the man: well-informed and creative in its communication. I was shocked that any Christian publishing house would allow a book of such depth to be put out on it label.<br /><br />This is a book that not only talks about God and the life he intends for us all, but one that seeks to engage us in that life. It is not hyperbole for me to say that this is amongst the best Christian books I have ever read. It is on my short-list of the best books I have ever read--period.<br /><br />My one slight critique of this book is that it follows the recent tradition in \\"Christian Living\\" books of quoting every source under the sun to try and back up its points. I think Steven James has a book here that would be able to stand up on its own authority. Too bad he didn't let it...<br /><br />All the same, I cannot recommend \\"Becoming Real: Christ's Call To Authentic Living\\" highly enough.<br /><br />Get a copy today.here that would be able to stand up on its own authority.

Here was a man who could start from anywhere, write about anything, and have you completely sucked into his world be the end of the first paragraph.<br /><br />And this is the least of the reasons he will be missed.<br /><br />The doctor wrote in eulogy of his friend George Plimpton a little over a year ago: \\"He lived his life like a work of fine art.\\"<br /><br />If Plimpton was a piece by Michaelangelo, Hunter S. Thompson was the biggest, boldest Kandinsky ever to stalk the canvas.<br /><br />Of my three favorite Twentieth Century authors (the other two being Thomas Merton--who reached upward, ever searching the silences, and Jack Kerouac--who was always reaching inward, bravely facing what he saw as the void) Hunter S. Thompson was my favorite. His writings reached out. They slapped one hell of a bear hug on the world he knew.<br /><br />There is something to be said for letting it ride.<br /><br />I read most of the columns in this book as they were published on ESPN.com. I recently reread them this past December when I checked Hey Rube out of the library. If you don't know the doctor, you might as well start here with his last work.<br /><br />It's like everything else he ever wrote: damn good. My God, you made one heck of a writer when you made this guy. What a journey he had.<br /><br />Now, to my great regret, I don't know where the good doctor has gone.

I found this guide indespensible in planning (and executing) my family's trip to Yellowstone. As has been noted, there is a quirky regional grouping problem with this guide (it groups the trails geographically rather than by how they are accessed). Yet this book is far better than any of the others I investigated (Orville Bach's is a distant second still worth investing in).<br /><br />The Lonely Planet guide to the Yellowstone region really goes hand in hand with this one. The Lonely Planet gives a good  overview with some regional coloring. This guide really lets you know what you're up against trail-wise.<br /><br />One thing that humored me greatly in our jorney across country were the varying uses of \\"easy, moderate, and strenuous\\" in the different parks between my house and Yellowstone. A free tip: An \\"easy\\" trail in Yellowstone is substantially more difficult than any \\"strenuous\\" trail at Mount Rushmore.<br /><br />Yellowstone is a place of haunting beauty. It was probably inadvisable for me to go at such a young age (I am in my twenties)--I will spend years longing to go back.<br /><br />Get this guide. Go to Yellowstone. Explore the trails, not just the boardwalks.<br /><br />You'll never regret it.<br /><br />There is no place on Earth that I give a higher recommendation (with the possible exception of the Tetons).	2005-02-01

No matter how lousy a lousy person feels, it's just plain lousy to spend all your lousy time saying lousy. It's even more lousy coming from a lousy book that is so often mentioned (by lousy critics no doubt living in lousy ivory towers) as a literary classic.<br /><br />Maybe the fact that Salinger became a recluse helped the book's short-term public and critical resume. Then again, if I'd written this lousy piece of trash, I'd go into hiding too.<br /><br />This book is lousy--don't waste your time on it.

So here I am at last, in the ending-place (if such it can be called) of the greatest epic of my time.<br /><br />By the time of my birth, all the Epics had come and gone. The Lord of the Rings, the works of Homer and Virgil, the Chronicles of Narnia, Herbert's Dune books, and even Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast series had all been written. Sprawling Imaginative Epics of great quality and vision seemed a thing of the past to this boy born in the waning days of the Twentieth Century.<br /><br />Then a few years ago (around the time when Wizard and Glass was published) I discovered Stephen King's Dark Tower. I found in these pages works that rivaled the greatness of the Epics of the past. I shared them with my wife--reading each book to her--with the exception of book four--which is truly Frank Muller's masterpiece as an audio reader.<br /><br />I was ahead of her most of the way, having read the books first myself and then having gone and reread them with her. The one exception being that we took book seven together. Some of these pages were hard to read. My review will be spoiler free, but those of you who have already finished will know the pages of which I speak.<br /><br />My wife found the ending satisfactory. I am of two minds. The joy is really in the journey. However, with all the growth in Roland over the span of the series, I (and I must confess to being a goal-oriented person who sees life as more of a mission than an experience) feel things get held up on a technicality.<br /><br />Such is the case though. The writer's will be served. All things being equal we are left with much to ponder.

The Black Ice is book number two in the series of books by Michael Connelly that star detective Hieronymous Bosch. It is in ways more symbolic and experimental than both its predecessor and all of its successors. While this is interesting, and not entirely without merit, it all adds up to a sum that is less than its parts.<br /><br />This is the weakest of the Bosch novels so far.<br /><br />There is an overwrought, yet uncompleted feel to The Black Ice. Its conclusion in particular is more than a little far-fetched and all too convenient.<br /><br />With that said, here is why The Black Ice is worth reading:<br /><br />1. Michael Connelly is one of the most interesting and talented writers out there. The combination of his journalistic training and his ability to paint cinematic word pictures that still work as lengthy pieces of fiction is unmatched by other genre writers.<br /><br />He links all of his books together in interesting ways. Once you step into his world, you begin to get inklings of just how vast it is. This is something rare in genre fiction--at least it is very rarely done this well.<br /><br />2. Harry Bosch is one hell of a character. Rather than being the one-sided archetype so often found in genre fiction, Bosch is fully human. He is exceptional in that though he is quite humanized, he is completely dedicated to his \\"mission\\" as a detective--most ably summed up by Bosch himself:<br /><br />\\"Everybody counts, or no one counts.\\"<br /><br />(An aside: I was recently discussing with my wife who her favorite character in Stephen King's Dark Tower Series is. We have read the books together. She went the emotional route and chose Oy--a sentimental, furry little creature.<br /><br />When asked who mine is (outside of Cuthbert, who is a bit player in books 1 & 4) I answered Roland.<br /><br />My wife does not like Roland. He is too mission-driven for her taste. I find, that like Bosch, Roland is more human for having to labor under the weight of a mission (I also feel that Oy gives his all for the mission as well, that he is not all cutesy and cuddly, but that is neither here nor there). The point being, that Bosch and Roland are two of the most fully fleshed out characters that I have come across in some time.<br /><br />I feel that this is because, conciously or not, we all live by a \\"mission\\" of sorts; be they for ill or good.<br /><br />an aside within an aside: my wife likes Bosch.)<br /><br />3.

Its well worth paying the price of admission: reading the first two books.<br /><br />I recommend the Bosch series of books very highly.<br /><br />As part of that recommendation, I suggest you grin and bear The Black Ice.<br /><br />Who knows, maybe you will find more here than I did.r the weight of a mission (I also feel that Oy gives his all for the mission as well, that he is not all cutesy and cuddly, but that is neither here nor there).

I'm not big on \\"dynamic equivalence.\\" Anyone who (like me) was first taught about Christ in a translation like the NIV or the NLT and who then studied the scriptures in their original languages can testify to the damage that has been done (intentionally or not) to our image of, thoughts about, and even our relationship with God by these slanted \\"takes on\\" the Bible.<br /><br />Bearing this in mind, I have much (MUCH) to say in praise of Mr. Peterson's wonderful Message.<br /><br />In a sense, The Message, while being one of the most dynamically equivalent translations, is also more faithful to the Word of God than any other translation currently available to English speakers and readers.<br /><br />God's word was never meant to be the province of those in ivory towers or high pulpits. It was to be the daily bread of people who lived in a hard-bitten, earthy world--people who, as the saying goes, often died with their boots on.<br /><br />The New Testament in particular is a book for the common man--for all men and women; young or old--everyone.<br /><br />Each author (recognizing that there is truly only One Author)in the New Testament has their own style: Paul is wordy--making his sylables into theological equations, Luke is refined, Mark is not, James makes up \\"Greek\\" words from Hebrew transliterations, John stands alongside David and Isaiah as the greatest poets of the Bible and has the most uncanny way of phrasing things.<br /><br />Peterson has captured a lot (not all--translators are forced--by their very endevour--to be traitors) of this in The Message. At the same time he manages to let the earthy, down-in-the-dust feel of the this book to shine through.<br /><br />Someone once said that the Church is not a museum for the saints, but a hospital for sinners. In the same way, the Bible is not a repository of high-flown language and myth. These are words of life from the very mouth of God.<br /><br />God is speaking through The Message.<br /><br />In the Middle Ages, illiterate believers gained their knowledge of the gospel from great cathedrals and their stained glass and tapestry retellings of the greatest story.<br /><br />We once more live in a world that has forgotten how to read the Bible.

I carried it in my pocket on a cross-country trip this summer and even bought my brother one for a birthday present while we were at Yellowstone.<br /><br />To explain what these things are and why I am so enthusiastic about them:<br /><br />These are little spiral books which look like passports that contain information on America's National Parks. The plastic inner flap contains a pull-out map showing America's entire National Park system. The rest of the book devides the parks into nine different color-coded regions. Each region is then given an overview and has places for stamps and stickers.<br /><br />A new set of stickers comes out each year. There are ten stickers in each set--nine regional and one national. The stickers are beautiful pictures of various parks or sites that also have a printed lower half giving info on that place.<br /><br />The stamps you can collect by visiting national parks. They are free. You just go up to the \\"cancellation station\\" (usually found in visitor's centers or ranger stations) and much like a passport, you can stamp you passport. The stamps (usually in color-coded ink matching the region) show the place and date of your visit.<br /><br />An aside: I mentioned that the stamps are **usually color-coded.** The stamp at Badlands National Park wasn't (I still love the place despite this failing).<br /><br />So far this year I have gotten stamps at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Pipestone National Monument, Mammoth Cave National Park, Lincoln's Birthplace National Historic Site, Badlands National Park, Mount Rushmore National Memorial, Devil's Tower National Monument, Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, Yellowstone National Park, and Grand Teton National Park (where I also got a stamp for the John D. Rockefeller Parkway--which is itself a part of the system)...<br /><br />...and just wait till next year. I intend on getting a few more.<br /><br />You can get more than one stamp from each park.

Say what you will about the greatness of modern translations of great literature--I too would argue that Fagles's Homer is worth its weight in gold, I'd take Raffel over Putnam any day the week in both Cervantes and Rabelais, Pevear and Volokhonsky have brought Dostoevsky to life for me--and yet there is something to be said for reading the E.V. Rieus, Samuel Putnams, and yes, the Constance Garnetts of the world.<br /><br />I am sure Pevear's Chekhov is Chekhov straight up, no filler or watering down. I'm sure it reveals the author in ways that those of us not yet able to speak or read Russian have not yet known. I will gladly read Pevear (and hopefully the Russian) somewhere on down the line.<br /><br />But here is Chekhov in the original English. Here is the wide-eyed, yet steady prose of Constance Garnett. We must not, in our hubris, bypass this. It is a treasure. I am glad for having read it.<br /><br />Mr. Foote's selections and foreword are as steady and beautifully clean as the translations of Ms. Garnett. He spent a good deal of time on this project and is to be commended for it. He is a true force in American letters, one whose greatness and influence will only grow with time.<br /><br />Modern Library is also to be commended for releasing these books in three well-done and excellent volumes. One could not ask for a better package for these works.<br /><br />I give this book and its two companion volumes a warm and heart-felt recommendation.	2004-12-11

Tin House is the best, most consistent literary journal currently on the market. Where else will you find great pieces of fiction by new and engaging voices on one page and then flip to the next and find a new translation by Seamus Heaney? Ploughshares is good, there are some other worthy entries as well (Alaskan Quarterly Review comes most prominently to mind), but none are as excellent as Tin House.<br /><br />I love the feel of my new Tin House when it comes in the mail. Each new issue features not only great fiction, interviews and articles, each is wrapped up in excellent design. This \\"magazine\\" (such a tawdry word in this context) is top notch.<br /><br />Tin House also does something that even the likes of Ploughshares and AQR often fail to do: it regularly delivers great poetry (Ploughshares seems to load up on poetry and hope something will be of worth.)<br /><br />If I had only one literary journal to recommend that people support and read, it would be Tin House.<br /><br />Check it out today!	2004-12-11

Surprised By Joy is a moving and thought-provoking intellectual, and ultlmately (stemming from the transformation of the intellect over time) spiritual autobiography. Like most of Lewis's works it is an engrossing book written in envigorating and lucid prose. Of all the books coming out of the growing \\"Lewis industry\\" there are none that do a better job of biography than this short work by the man himself.<br /><br />Lewis tells the story of his life up until he found true joy in following Jesus Christ. From his misty early memories of playing with his brother, to his time in school, Lewis gives his personal history a rigorous and reflective once-over. Along the way, he encounters many sign posts, all of which lead to his eventual encounter with Christ.<br /><br />In school I once had a class on Christian Mythopoeic authors. We studied four: George MacDonald, J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and Charles Williams at length. Each of us were given two huge projects on which our grades depended. Mine were to research and present on C.S. Lewis and Frederick Buechner.<br /><br />I got to know the works by and about both men quite well.<br /><br />Many Lewis biographers focus a lot of their time on Lewis's schooling experiences. This is probably because of their salacious \\"shock value.\\" But focusing solely on those experiences without getting the point of what Lewis is saying in this book (as so many do) is a massive example of throwing the baby out with the bath water.<br /><br />True, Lewis, like any autobiographer, has some axes to grind (and in my opinion is more than just in doing so), but he also has a most vital message to share:<br /><br />Behind all of our longings, even our sufferings, is the unimaginable possibility of true, pure, radiant joy.<br /><br />On another note, I found that Surprised By Joy is itself a great reading list for works in the \\"Northern\\" and mythopoeic fields. Lewis was nothing if not well read, and he shares his intelectual evolution (and the works involved) in this book.<br /><br />I will leave you with a favorite quote of mine from this book. The set up, is that a former schoolmate of Lewis's (who became the Archbishop of Dublin) and Lewis are sitting together at the funeral of a horrid man who had once been their very abusive schoolmaster:<br /><br />\\"Speaking of Oldee's death, I said to him, \\"Well, we shan't see him again.\\"<br /><br />\\"You mean,\\" he answered with a grim smile, \\"we hope we shan't.\\"<br /><br />I give this book my full recommendation.tion (and the works involved) in this book.  <br /> <br />I will leave you with a favorite quote of mine from this book.

Whatever else one may feel about President Lincoln (he has been both glorified as a martyr and demonized as an opponent of individual civil liberties), one cannot come away from this great little anthology of his speeches without seeing a principle-driven politician at his best. And the principle that we see driving Lincoln from his very earliest days through his final speeches (although by that time, preserving the Union had become an equally important theme) is that of the abolition of slavery.<br /><br />Lincoln is clearly a man who believed in right and wrong. He sees slavery as the great evil of his day. From the beginning of his political involvement to the day he died, his speeches show him as a man determined to do away with this evil.<br /><br />If only we had one man in our political arena as interested in principles today. We have'nt had one in our Federal Government since Paul Wellstone died. Too many are money and/or power driven rather than having any interest in principle.<br /><br />I do not say this to despair.<br /><br />I picked up my copy of this book this spring at the gift shop of the National Historic site for Lincoln's birthplace. Both the site (which is beautiful and well worth seeing if you're ever in Kentucky) and the book stand as testimonies to what one determined man of principles can do.<br /><br />Read these speeches if you get a chance.<br /><br />I recommend them highly.	2004-12-09

She had a principle. Boiled down to its most simple phrasing, Milstein's Principle states: \\"if you've heard of a thing once, you will hear of it again.\\"<br /><br />I have yet to find anything that can stand against this principle.<br /><br />A case in point: Hieronymous Bosch. At least, I thought, I will never hear of this guy outside of an art-world setting. Once more, I bow to the principle.<br /><br />Michael Connelly is, as the saying goes--one helluva writer. He and his Bosch books stand at the pinnacle of the loosely grouped writers & fiction known as the \\"New Noir.\\" I am not a huge fan of genre fiction (especially mystery) but Harry Bosch has made a fan of me.<br /><br />This first book of the series, The Black Echo, introduces us to a very grim (he gets more humanized in later books) Detective Bosch. He's just been demoted, he's got a painfully bureaucratic new boss, and an old platoon-mate from Vietnam has just turned up dead.<br /><br />From here things only get more murky and dangerous.<br /><br />The Black Echo is not the strongest of the Bosch series (which really starts hitting its stride in book three). It is a good introduction to a lot of the characters you will get to know better throughout the series.<br /><br />Connelly's style is very cinematic. Having honed his skills as a journalist, the author is the master of taking snapshot after successive snapshot and then building these pictures into a compelling story.<br /><br />As a stand-alone work, the Black Echo is a B+ at best, but I cannot give any higher recommendation to a series of books than I can for those of the Harry Bosch series.<br /><br />Get a copy of The Black Echo today and dive in.	2004-12-09

Keeper is the second novel I've read that deals with the issues involved in America's abortion debate. The first, Insomnia by Stephen King, dealt with the issues in a way that I found surprisingly insightful and somewhat even-handed. Insomnia was, like most of Mr. King's work, very character driven and it worked on many fronts--mostly those not dealing with the abortion debate. It got bogged down and seemed to throw the abortion issues into an already full pot.<br /><br />On the other hand, Keeper's drama centers on and stems from the abortion debate. Keeper is also somewhat even-handed (in the end, both Insomnia and Keeper tend more towards the pro-abortion side of things). Keeper is just as Character driven, but somewhat less engrossing than Insomnia (not to compare the two--they are really apples and oranges in all respects but the abortion).<br /><br />Keeper's main character is Atticus Kodiak--a bodyguard. He is the only fully drawn character in the book. Another character, a private eye named Bridget, almost comes to life as well, but only almost.<br /><br />We are drawn (first person narration) into Atticus's world. The strength and the hook of Keeper is our fascination with Atticus's life. Mine wasn't that strong for the first half of the book; yet he grew on me.<br /><br />Keeper is not really a whodunnit. Its a wedamnwellknowwhodunnit for most of its length. Keeper is more of a can-he-stop-it than a mystery.<br /><br />It is what it is with some hardbitten prose and dialogue torn from the pages of Elmore Leonard. I found it entertaining enough that I'll read the next book of the series (O God please let it not be about abortion this time) and report back here.<br /><br />Till then, this one gets more of a nod than a recommendation.<br /><br />(As a grim postscript and an aside--if, for some reason, you are interested in further aborti-fiction and want a piece from the opposing side of the debate, check out F. Paul Wilson's story Foet in the Borderlands 2 anthology. It is quite a nasty little piece, but well done--very well done).one--very well done).	2004-12-06

He was a man of questions and flights of powerfully intellectual fancy. He changed how the world looks at literature.<br /><br />I will not clang the bells and start up the chorus of \\"ding-dong Derrida's dead\\" that might be expected from a Christian reader of the man's work (if anyone expected Derrida to have such readers--we are inexcusably few).<br /><br />Instead, I will say that in Derrida, and in this set of essays, his look into Kierkegaard in particular, I have found a kindred seeker after truth, if not a kindred professor of it.<br /><br />Jacques is now with the undeconstructable--both the source, fulfillment, and, in most cases, the negation of all his observations and questions. He is with the pure ineffable which choses to speak to and through the failable.<br /><br />The very mention of such belies most of Derrida's work.<br /><br />The certainty that springs from his work's invalidation gives me peace that the seeker has at last found, that Jacques Derrida is now fully and forever constructed.<br /><br />His work is over, but his true life--as with all the lives of those who seek and ask--has resumed an ancient, intended course.<br /><br />Rest in freedom and fulfillment, Mr Derrida.	2004-10-16

It is the greatest of the Dark Tower books so far--The Dark Tower itself not yet released--and along with Desperation, one of the two greatest books yet published by Sai King. But before I move into superlatives, let me first set the stage for my review by telling you how I encountered this book.<br /><br />Picture in your mind if you will, a twenty-year-old father. Imagine that this father works 53 hours a week on a four day schedule. Imagine further, that this father also is taking 16 credit hours in college on a two day schedule.<br /><br />You got it?<br /><br />Good.<br /><br />That was me at the time I first read (actually, listened--to a wonderful recording read by the King of audiobooks, Frank Muller) Wizard and Glass. Some nights I came home and only had enough strength to push play and fall into bed. I do not say this to whine, I say it to show the power of story in general, and this one in particular.<br /><br />By every logical, biological, and plain old commonsense measure, I should have been dead to the world on those nights. Yet Wizard and Glass was story enough to keep me awake well past what should have been my bedtime. Roland of Gilead's longing, once dead, but now reawakening heart held a great affinity for me.<br /><br />In Wizard and Glass, King captures both the banality and the wonderful, hormone-driven mess that is teenage love. He also fleshes out one of the greatest characters (and my favorite) in the Dark Tower series: Cuthbert Allgood. Roland's fireside chat is quite a thing.<br /><br />Perhaps it is the best thing King has ever done.<br /><br />If you have not read the Dark Tower series, do so. This book alone is worth the journey.<br /><br />I give Wizard and Glass my absolute highest recommendation.	2004-08-30

So here goes...(may this not damn me to eternal nerd-dom)...<br /><br />One upon a time in High School I read this crappy little sham of a book. I had friends who were into the Evil Dead movies. More to the point, I enjoyed Army of Darkness (still a fine movie) and the fiction of Lovecraft (great writer) and Crowley (a master of turgid prose who was once bested in a fight by Wimpy Boy Yeats).<br /><br />So, when I saw this book, I thought it would be a lark to buy a copy. The damn thing sat around on a dusty shelf for a while.<br /><br />Then one night I had a friend of mine who happened to be a girl (I already had a girlfriend) come over. Like most teenage drama, there were those who thought she and I were secretly a couple.<br /><br />So I thought, what the hell--they already think we're a couple--and tried to use one of the spells inside to make her fall in love with me.<br /><br />You be the judge. Nothing happened that night but inane and overwrought teenage discussion and movie watching. Six months later, when I was dating one of her friends, she declared her love for me. I let it lie.<br /><br />Either it was the book, coincidence, or the teenage girl's propensity to steal her friend's boyfriend. The last two are common to man. The first is not.<br /><br />And only geeks who would take this book seriously would care.<br /><br />To whoever thought up printing this thing though--Kudos on the media tie-in marketing skills (If I were the kind of guy who said \\"Kudos\\"--which I am most definitely not).	2004-08-21

The continuing quality of the Frankenhuyzen's and Mrs. Wargin's work stands up well against any of the other people currently in the hall.<br /><br />Saving Samantha is the story of Robbyn's rehabilitation of Samantha, a wounded vixen. Told in journal form, the book is about Sam's sojourn with the Frankenhuyzen family and of her return to the wild. I found the book to be moving and informative.<br /><br />As I have increasingly come to expect, Gijsbert's illustrations are excellent.

You don't know me, so you probably haven't sat around with me and heard me explain (usually ad nauseum) my feelings about Melodrama being a legitimate and possibly superior alternative to the two traditional forms of storytelling: Tragedy and Comedy. I won't go into the theory and application here, but to boil it down, I feel that all art must have the ability to make people FEEL (something inherent in Melodrama but not always necessary for the two others). I say all this to give a you a sense of what a high compliment it is for me to say that Adopted by an Owl made me feel (though I wouldn't call it Melodrama).<br /><br />If I was the kind of guy who used the word \\"Kudos\\" (Thank the Most High that I am not), I would say: \\"Kudos\\" to Robbyn for the clarity of her prose and the wonderful honesty of her storytelling. One experiences and understands all of Gijsbert's varied feelings toward Jackson's tentative return to the wild. Kids and parents alike will find this story worthwhile (though I had to pause for a moment in reading it aloud to my kids--because I got choked up).<br /><br />The illustrations are wonderful (though very similar in palette to The Legend of Leelanau).

I have to say that this is the first truly great entry in the \\"Legend of\\" Series. It is also my favorite of the stories.<br /><br />Story is big here. Petoseygay's story is told with haunting beauty and a lyrical simplicity. And, unlike the Legend of Sleeping Bear (my previous favorite in the series), it will not cause clinical depression.<br /><br />I also feel that Gijsbert van Frankenhuyzen ($10 to the first person who can say this man's name five times fast) has done his best work of the series in this book. He not only sets up a distinct visual world for the story, he makes each illustration wonderful and unique. My favorite is the picture of \\"where bears walked beside the flowing waters.\\"<br /><br />My son exclaimed \\"I see the bear.\\"<br /><br />The Legend of the Petoskey Stone is the strongest entry yet in a very strong series. The great storytelling, beautiful images, and uplifting message are well worth the time spent reading.

Only Tolkien and Wendell Berry can stand in his presence.<br /><br />Literary bean counters and genre-nazis be damned in the cages of their own invention! What we have here in the shadow of the Tower (as I write book seven is a couple months from release) is storytelling on a level and of a scope NEVER reached before.<br /><br />Song of Susannah is a case in point when I speak of level. In a series where each book is so unique in form and approach, Song of Susannah has to be the most tightly plotted 400 page book I have ever read.<br /><br />For its length, Song of Susannah is a razor blade of a book.<br /><br />I love the epic of Wizard and Glass and deeply enjoyed the sprawling mass that was The Wolves of the Calla. While I do not feel Song of Susannah approaches the greatness of Wizard and Glass, this is a book that cuts into the heart of the reader and leaves one haunted long after the tale is done.<br /><br />I give this sixth book in the series my heartfelt recommendation.<br /><br />If you have not yet come to the world of Roland and the Tower, take my hand and enter a world you will not regret having sojourned in...<br /><br />...I think there's a door somewhere over here with your name on it.	2004-07-21

Especially in the early morning fog, the other side of Midway Geyser Basin (the side NOT on a tourist-tastic boardwalk) is majestic and wonderful. Fairy Falls is the most beautiful of the many falls I saw in the park.<br />Get the beans at the Roosevelt Lodge. They are the ONLY beans I've ever had that I'd gladly part with $3 for. (Corresponding tip: the beans elsewhere are $3 also--but you can buy your own can of Busch's for half that).<br />Don't be frightened off by all the Bear talk. The only Bear I saw was halfway up a mountain and about the size of a quarter from where I stood. The Elk on the other hand...<br />Going to the Tetons will explain the line &quot;Purple Mountains Majesty.&quot; Hiking in the Shadow of Moran or the Grand Teton = instant perspective on life.<br />Driving through the Big Horn Mountains on the way to Yellowstone is every bit as breathtaking as anything I saw in either park. Its &quot;wow&quot; factor led me to even buy a hat as a souvenir.<br />Wyoming has to have the highest concentration per square mile of what Patrick McManus calls &quot;Old Men&quot; in his classic A Fine and Pleasant Misery story The Theory and Application of Old Men. This was great for my son. I enjoyed it too.<br />Probably my biggest tip:<br />Go to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. (If you're coming the way I came, Badlands NP is well worth it too).<br />My second biggest tip:<br />Get this book for all the tips it contains. I recommend it wholeheartedly.	2004-07-16

Marlo Schalesky has what it takes to become a truly great writer. Only the Wind Remembers is a powerful book. I could not put it down during the last one hundred pages.<br />This is a book I feel so strongly about that I am taking time out (late at night I might add) on the day before I begin a cross-country camping trip in order to share my thoughts about it here. Let me start by saying Only the Wind Remembers is a book you should read. I've read a few books lately, and while some have been pretty decent stories, none of them has topped this one by Mrs. Schalesky.<br />In fact, I have high hopes for Mrs. Schalesky as a writer. If this story is any gauge of what might be to come, the sky is the limit for her. She made me care about these characters.<br />A book can be as well or poorly written as it wants, but it it doesn't make me FEEL, then it is a waste of time. This book is well written. And my time was not wasted.<br />Yet what I fear has been wasted is the wider audience. I am grieved that talents like Marlo Schalesky continue to labor in the irrelevant obscurity of the &quot;christian&quot; publishing ghetto. This book is a keeper; but &quot;christian&quot; ghetto styling--the ham-handed sentimentality of the character of Pop, the blatant interpretation of the parable, and the tacky epilogue--combined with the built in audience/restricted circulation of &quot;christian&quot; publishing condemn this book to falling into the wrong hands (preaching to the choir) and not being seen or taken seriously by the rest of the world--which according to the Great Commission needs to hear this a whole lot more than I or other Christ-followers do).<br />The story of Yuna is some of the greatest pound for pound writing that I have read in a long time. I only wish that it could reach more people who actually need it. The Eagles's outstretched wings seek to embrace us all.<br />I wholeheartedly recommend this book.	2004-06-22

This is not true, but I do often wonder at how people know of some of the truly great places to go in my home state.<br />Any knowledge that I might have comes from owning several books written by Jim Dufresne. Dufresne is among a handful of what I consider the best writers out there when it comes to the outdoors/travel. Happily, he lives in and writes about my home state.<br />I not only own this 50 hikes book, but I have books written by Dufresne on hiking with children in Michigan, Michigan's State Parks, the Porcupine Mountains, and the best campgrounds in Michigan. With the exception of the Porcupine Mountains book (which is of a narrower interest) all of these books are indispensable.<br />50 hikes in Michigan (there are actually 60 hikes listed) really does contain most of the best hikes in the lower peninsula of Michigan. From this book I learned of the Algonquin trail in beautiful and semi-remote Negwegon State Park (you won't find any brown signs on the main roads leading you there). This hike alone is worth the price of the book.<br />But why stop there?<br />You can also explore such places as the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, the Manistee River Trail and the plethora of shorter trails in Waterloo State Recreation area. These hikes and the others listed in this well-written and engaging book are some of the best to be found anywhere. I only wish there were an Upper Peninsula edition.<br />Jim Dufresne himself, though not homegrown, is one of Michigan's great treasures. I recommend this book and others by him.<br />Get a copy today.	2004-05-17

It has earned a place within my heart. I long to return.<br />&quot;The Legend of&quot; books by Kathy-Jo Wargin and Gijsbert Van Frankenhuyzen are consistent in their excellence. The artwork and prose sings. Each volume provides a glimpse of a world that has moved on, but which still puts forth rippling echoes.<br />The Legend of Sleeping Bear and The Legend of Leelanau are the high points in this most meritorious series. Of the two, I prefer the one reviewed here. Its text is not quite as lengthy. Therefore, it is more likely to keep the attention of young readers/listeners.<br />The Legend of Sleeping Bear captures the tender majesty of the Sleeping Bear region while painting a fantastic picture of the legend surrounding its origin. One cannot help being moved by this story of love.<br />Governor Granholm gave out copies of it at her inauguration.<br />I give this book a very high recommendation. If you can, visit the region. It is a truly beautiful place.	2004-04-08

How could it be? This book--part fairy tale, part social commentary, part rain-sodden film noir--is unlike any book I have ever read.<br />A while back I tried to read David Guterson's Snow Falling On Cedars. I could not get into the book for some reason. I could not invest myself, emotionally or mentally, in any of the characters. I started out not caring and ended up not finishing the book. You can then imagine my trepidation when I picked up a copy of Our Lady of the Forest. However, I found myself intriguiged by the story description.<br />Against my better judgement I gave the book a try.<br />I found that Our Lady of the Forest is one book that is very hard to put down.<br />Guterson rambled in Snow Falling On Cedars. Here he proves himself to be a master of spare, soul-reverberating prose and taught plot-lines. His characters are hauntingly simple but carry an immense weight and depth. His scenes, especially the climax, echo in the reader's mind for a long time after putting the novel down.<br />The tale of Anne and her visions, and of the lives affected by them is one of the best pieces of storytelling I have read in a long time. Like the great Northern Forest in which it is set, it is vast--inspiring to the intellect--and stirring, even humbling, to the soul.<br />I give this book my full recommendation.	2004-02-22

I came with very high expectations. Especially after Wizard and Glass, which is, in my opinion, (along with Desperation) one of King's two best books so far. While Wolves is not as great as Wizard and Glass, I feel in no way let down.<br />Wolves of the Calla is a great book.<br />The Story itself owes a big deal to The Magnificent Seven. This is the Dark Tower version of a border town, inspired by the arrival of Gunslingers, rising up against its oppressors. Will the town have the courage to stand? Will they win the day or somehow become worse off? It all draws down to one apocalyptic battle.<br />Thrown into this backdrop we have the continuing story of Roland and his Ka-Tet's quest for the Tower. Susanah's about to have a little one (or perhaps not so little) and doesn't even know it. Jake is growning up fast. Roland too is growing older--at the most inopportune time. Eddie is becoming a more formidable gunslinger by the day.<br />Add to this the appearance of Father Callahan from Salem's Lot, an unexpected trip to New York, the reappearance of a certain flower, and you get a very engrossing story.<br />I have said this before but it bears saying again: I am impressed with the continued development of King's storytelling and writing abilities.<br />Literary gasbags like Harold Bloom sound shriller and more foolish the more they criticize a master like King. He may be a genre writer who writes in the dialect of the people, but so what? So was Dickens. So was Faulkner. I would stack his work of the last ten years up against any writer living. If weighed fairly, it would not be found lacking.<br />In other words: read this book. If you haven't started the Dark Tower series yet, do so. The first book is a little bit of a hurdle, but you will not be sorry.	2003-12-09

It is a shame that so few do. If you'll forgive my presumptuousness, please let me tell you why you should take the time to meet the man and his poems.<br />First, you should meet him because he is messy.<br />If you have ever read Keats (lamentably few of you have probably even done this--much less reading Swinburne) then you will know the glory of the perfectly visual, perfectly written poem.<br />Swinburne, for all of the beauty in his words, has none of this in his writing. If the poetry of Keats is a stunningly well tended garden then the poetry of Swinburne is a lush overgrown field of wildflowers.<br />Second, you should meet Swinburne because he is exhilarating.<br />Few poets have the courage or the skill to layer line after unforgettable line like Swinburne. The very first poem in this book: A Ballad of Life, will demonstrate what I mean.<br />Third, you should meet Swinburne because of the very fact that he is too little read.<br />He is considered to be one of the group called Pre-Raphaelite poets (his book Poems and Ballads is dedicated to his friend and Pre-Raphaelite painter Edward Burne-Jones).<br />This group as a whole gets criminally overlooked. After reading works by Pre-Raphaelites like Swinburne, William Morris and Dante Gabriel Rossetti I must say that I believe they stack up very well against their predecessors (the Romantics) and (in my opinion) eclipse successors like Yeats.<br />So, if you are looking for something to expand your literary horizons, or would just like something truly powerful and lovely to read, give this book by Swinburne a try.<br />I give it my recommendation.	2003-12-09

I did not expect what I found in this book. All too many short novellas seem to be flooding the market of late--disguised (and priced) as full novels. They tend to be pasty, feel-good schlock. The vast majority of readers seem satisfied with this dreadful staus quo. For those of us who seek more The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a pleasant surprise.<br />Albom is a born storyteller. Being a native of Southeastern Michigan, I have known this for years. I grew up reading Mitch's excellent columns in The Detroit Free Press (though I still prefer my hometown paper--The Ann Arbor News). Mitch's great storytelling ability is on full display in The Five People You Meet in Heaven.<br />In this book Albom proves that he can rise above the ranks of the mere storytellers. The thing that shocked me about this book was how well written it is. Mitch catches the language, tone and heart of this story in beautifully spare prose. We can forgive him if he sometimes veers toward the sentimental. His story, centered on one man's viewing of his life from the perspective of heaven, is necessarily nostalgic and emotional.<br />As a story I find The Five People You Meet in Heaven compelling. Yet, I do think God lingers too much in the background. I believe in and know a personal God. Albom's God is way too aloof for my taste. His version of heaven perfectly expresses the love of one's neighbor but leaves out the part about loving God with all of one's heart, mind, soul, and strength. Without this perfect love, humanity will always fall and fail at loving one another.<br />The Five People You Meet in Heaven is an impressive fictional debut for a very talented writer. The story is gripping even if it is found lacking in other ways. I give it my recommendation.<br />If you end up liking this book I also highly recommend The Great Divorce by C.S. Lewis. If you are more adventurous still, other great books in the Literature of Heaven and Hell are: The Bible (I prefer the English Standard Version), The Epic of Gilgamesh, Homer's Odyssey (trans. Robert Fagles), The Aeneid by Virgil (trans Robert Fitzgerald), and Dante's Divine Comedy (trans. John Ciardi).

The boogyman of that time--the anarchist, has a lot in common with our own chosen boogyman--the terrorist. The response of the &quot;heros&quot; of the book are very similar to the response of the Western World of today: they are all over the map. One could get so caught up in counting similarities and dissecting philosophies, that the biggest, almost garishly glaring fact about The Man Who Was Thursday could be missed: it is a masterpiece.<br />The Man Who Was Thursday is a tense, masterfully structured thriller that has powerful echoes of the Biblical book of Job. Chesterton subtitled this novel &quot;a nightimare.&quot;<br />The characters of The Man Who Was Thursday move through a world twisted by forces outside of their comprehension. They ultimately encounter the nightmare of a deity-figure who is more of a force of random and capricious nature than a personal being. God's non-answer in the book of Job is amplified to a worldview in The Man Who Was Thursday.<br />The genius of Chesterton is that his book produces a question in the soul of the attentive reader that demands and points the way to an answer.<br />This is indeed a book worthy of reading, reflection, and even interaction. It blows through you like a wind that cannot leave what it touches unchanged.<br />I give The Man Who Was Thursday my highest recommendation.	2003-11-30

Lewis difficult. What??? C.S. Lewis had the cleanest, most lucid prose style ever known to English (His poetry however is another case).<br />I guess I am left asking--like the Professor in Lewis's The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe--&quot;What are they teaching in schools these days?&quot;<br />Now that that is out of my system:<br />Mere Christianity is a fine book. It played a huge part in my own acceptance of Christ as my Savior. Lewis's arguments for the presence of a universal standard of behavior, of the presence of conscience/the Holy Spirit met me right where my atheistic/agnostic self had been living. &quot;If we do not believe in decent behavior, why should we be so anxious to make excuses for not having behaved decently?&quot;<br />Lewis follows his opening argument by presenting what he sees as the basic Christian beliefs and the general characteristics of Christian living. In the chapter titled The Invasion Lewis states the position of the Christian in the world quite succinctly and eloquently:<br />&quot;Enemy-occupied territory--that is what the world is. Christianity is the story of how the rightful king has landed, you might say landed in disguise, and is calling us all to take part in a great campaign of sabotage.&quot;<br />Lewis's arguments are chock full of such vivid passages. His real strength is in the boiling down of his arguments. Lewis gets to the absolute core of True Christian beliefs and traditional Christian living.<br />At the end of the last century the magazine Christianity Today called Mere Christianity the Christian book of the century. I personally think that this is a bit of an overestimation (the Bible speaks to all generations and is the book of every century), but Mere Christianity is indeed a worthy book.<br />I give Mere Christianity my full recommendation.	2003-10-28

These three stories strike me as a mixed bag. All of them started with great ideas but in my opinion, only one fully delivers on its promise.<br />It is unfortunate that the first story, Lunch at the Gotham Caf&eacute;, is the weakest. This story--centering on the feelings of betrayal and loss brought on by divorce and an unthinkable event over lunch--just doesn't do it for me. King may get to the root of the fears and emotions involved here but I was left cold by the pointless Catcher in the Rye-esque ending.<br />1408 is a very well crafted story. I can't help thinking how much more it could have been though. Given more space than one single audio cassette, this story could have been great.<br />The jewel of this collection is In the Deathroom. What King does here in a very short space is remarkable. True character development, suspense, even catharsis--young short story authors should study this one.<br />I couldn't help noticing that the hero of 1408's last name was Dearborn. We will all be reading more of Will Dearborn soon. Until then--Blood and Smoke is a decent way to pass the time.<br />For all of its unevenness, I recommend Blood and Smoke.	2003-10-27

Modern readers of Dicken's A Christmas Carol are often inoculated to what a shocking piece of literature it was in its day. Familiarity has softened its blow to the public at large. This is not so with The Chimes.<br />The Chimes is the second of Dickens's &quot;Christmas Books.&quot; Written in 1844 it came a year after A Christmas Carol and a year before The Cricket on the Hearth. Not nearly as widely read as either its predecessor or its successor, The Chimes probably packs more of an emotional wallop than either story.<br />Set on a New Year's Eve rather than on Christmas proper, The Chimes is a story about self-respect and the consequences of our choices. The main character, Trotty Veck is an inverse of sorts to A Christmas Carol's Ebeneezer Scrooge. He is poor and thinks so little of himself that he threatens to destroy himself and his family. Only through supernatural intervention can things hope to be set right.<br />I first listened to this recording of The Chimes on last New Year's Eve. First of all, this recording is unabridged (even though it is currently listed as abridged.) Secondly, this particular recording is a wonderful reading of The Chimes. One could not ask for more.<br />The Chimes is a tale that will--as the best of Dickensian melodrama does--grip you and wring your heart. One really gets the sense of what reading Dickens must have felt like to his contemporaries.<br />This is powerful stuff. Give it a try.	2003-09-12

I was amazed at the vastness and calm of the place. It has a grandeur and a haunting quality. Amidst it all I made another discovery: the powerful, in truth--the GREAT--poetry of Davis McCombs.<br />Somewhere in his evocations of place and suggestions of identity McCombs finds a beauty much like that of the caves. For the most part it isn't flashy. It is solid. It calls. It is true.<br />I'm not a huge fan of \\"narrative\\" poems. Most such literary beasts should become brave and full enough to stand as short stories. The language and, God help us, rhymes are more torture in such cases than poetry. Yet here in McCombs we have a master of narrative not seen on these shores since Poe.<br />More powerful than his narrative skills is McCombs's spareness of language. He communicates picture perfect verbal images with the dead-on certainty of phrase of a John Ashbery. He also does it without having to resort to Ashbery's often droning, lengthy verbosity.<br />My favorite thing about Ultima Thule is the sense of camraderie in McCombs's poetry. We journey into candlelit depths and to solitary gravesites. Yet we are not alone. The sense of brotherhood in these poems rivals the best of Whitman and Baudelaire.<br />Poe, Ashbery, Whitman and Baudelaire--these are some of my favorite poets. They are some of the greatest who ever lived. With Ultima Thule Davis McCombs joins their number.	2003-08-19

Books like The Green Mile, Bag of Bones and Desperation have made me appreciate his depth and skill as a writer--the Dark Tower series has blown me away. Now...along comes From a Buick 8. It, like the enigmatic &quot;vehicle&quot; mentioned in its title, is truly unique.<br />Here we have the powerful sense of camaraderie common to his greatest novels and novellas. The bond between the group of law officers in this book is strongly reminiscent of that between the prisoners in Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption and the guards in the Green Mile. King has done well with ensemble groups of characters--this book is no exception.<br />From a Buick 8 also does very well in making each character of the ensemble &quot;deep.&quot; There are no stock characters here. In this sense, this book approaches the emotional heights of Desperation and the last couple of Dark Tower books.<br />From a Buick 8 is genuinely creepy without becoming overly grotesque. This is not necessarily always a plus when it comes to books from the &quot;horror&quot; genre, but it works to great effect in this story. I was reading this book while camping in the wilderness. The woods seemed to make a little more noise of the suspicious variety if I read some right before bed.<br />There is also a scene recounting a father's feelings towards his son that holds forth a deep truth. It should not be missed or simply passed over.<br />From a Buick 8 is not, in my opinion, King's best work--but it is still darn good. He continues to impress me as a writer growing in skill and importance as he ages. There are rumors that he may retire after the publication of the final Dark Tower books.<br />If this book is any indication of what might still be over the horizon of his imagination, I sure hope these rumors don't prove true.	2003-07-20

Euripides tore away the shackles of the &quot;how to write a play&quot; of his day--Aristotelian dramatic theory. In the process, modern Western drama was born. His play Medea is a prime example.<br /><br />At first glance Medea does, in some respects, exemplify Aristotle's requirements for a tragedy. However, the play violates Aristotle's vision more than it corresponds to it.  It does this through untraditional content and innovation.<br />In layout and movement of the plot, Medea closely matches the form of Aristotle's standard example of a tragedy--Sophocles's Oedipus Rex. Medea shares Oedipus's convention of beginning with the perspective of a mournful look back on the events that are about to be told.<br />Medea is highborn and descends from the lineage of the Gods. This in some ways fulfills Aristotle's requirement that the protagonist be exceptional. Likewise, both Medea and Oedipus depict what Aristotle would call &quot;terrible and piteous events.&quot; However, this is where the similarity with Aristotle's ideal of the tragic ends.<br />The character of Medea is the main wrench that Euripides throws into Aristotle's description of tragedy. Aristotle's idea of the tragic hero demanded a change of experience and fortune that entails unmerited suffering on the part of the character and a fearful viewing of events on behalf of the audience. These things do not happen in Medea.<br />Medea has a history. She has killed spitefully and coldly in the past. She continues to do so throughout the play. She never even faces the threat of a fall from a high station because she secures sanctuary in Athens before she sets her revenge into motion (incidentally, one comes to feel like the psalmist who wrote: &quot;I have seen a wicked and ruthless man flourishing like a green tree in its native soil&quot;--though in this case it is a wicked woman). Euripides uses Medea to make a commentary, not to bring about that lynch-pin of Aristotelian drama: catharsis.<br />Medea does not attempt to meet up with Aristotle's requirements. Instead, it is becomes new form of art--tragedy as social commentary. Euripides shows himself to be among the great artistic innovators in history by his transformation of a received dramatic form into something different but wholly effective in its own way.).

They touch on the \\"BIG\\" themes like the gods, Truth, Wisdom and Death...<br />Death is the ultimate bummer in the ancient Greek worldview. It is not a pretty picture. As seen in the Odyssey, death can be a very nasty place. Even for the best---heroes like Achilles, death is like an eternal waiting room with no eventual appointment. How unsurprising then, that Socrates, who loved to turn Greek convention on its ear, would envision death as the ultimate journey, the ultimate freedom.<br /><br />Socrates sees the chief value of death as the soul's final separation from the horrid constraints of the body. According to him, the body holds back the soul. With it, man can never encounter the ultimate justice, beauty and truth. Without the body, all things seem possible to Socrates. As far as this line of thinking goes, I find Socrates' thought to be very similar to some forms of Buddhism and the more extreme kinds of Christian asceticism (largely influenced by Plato's Socrates).<br />However, Socrates goes beyond this. He claims that there is some kind of reward that awaits those who willingly come to death. A seat among the gods he calls it...<br />How ironic then that Socrates dies amidst the worldly concern of a debt that he owes.<br />How does that old line go? Something about folks trying to save their own life losing it?	2003-06-19

It is clearly not one of Shakespeare's greatest plays. As You Like It is more obscure than famous. Even amongst the comedies it comes nowhere close to the popularity of plays such as A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Tempest, or Twelfth Night. That said, it is a treasure in its own right. This is so, if for nothing else, because it contains one of the greatest pictures of a woman to be found in Shakespeare's works, excluding the Sonnets.<br />Ah, sweet Rosalind. In her are encapsulated so many ideas about the nature of woman. She is first pictured in a rather faux-Petrarchan manner. This quickly fades as an intelligent woman comes to the fore. While the intelligence remains, she is also torn by the savage winds of romantic love. Rosalind, in all her complexity and self-contradiction, is a truly modern female character.<br />Most of the women in Shakespeare's tragedies and historical plays are either window dressing (as in Julius Caesar) or woefully one-sided (Ophelia, Lady Macbeth). This is not the case with Rosalind. Rather than being marginalized, she is the focus of a good chunk of the play. Instead of being static and [standard], she is a complex evolving character.<br />When Rosalind first appears, she outwardly looks much like any other lady of the court. She is a stunning beauty. She is much praised for her virtue. Both of these elements factor in the Duke's decision to banish or [do away with] her.<br />Rosalind falls in love immediately upon seeing Orlando. In this way she at first seems to back up a typically courtly idea of \\"love at first sight.\\" Also, she initially seems quite unattainable to Orlando. These are echoes of Petrarchan notions that proclaim love to be a painful thing. This dynamic is stood on its head following her banishment.<br />Rosalind begins to question the certainty of Orlando's affection. She criticizes his doggerel when she finds it nailed to a tree. Rather than wilting like some medieval flower, she puts into effect a plan. She seeks to test the validity of her pretty-boy's love. In the guise of a boy herself, she questions the deceived Orlando about his love.<br />Yet Rosalind is not always so assured. Her steadfastness is not cut and dried. Composed in his presence, Rosalind melts the second Orlando goes away. She starts spouting romantic drivel worthy of Judith Krantz. Even her best friend Celia seems to tire of her love talk. This hesitating, yet consuming passion is thrown into stark relief with her crystal clear dealings with the unwanted advances of the shepherdess Phebe.<br />Rosalind contradicts herself in taking the side of Silvius in his pursuit of Phebe. She seeks to help Silvius win the love of Phebe because of his endearing constancy. Yet the whole reason she tests Orlando is the supposed inconstancy of men's affections.<br />This idea of Male inconstancy has made its way down to the present day. Men are seen, in many circles, as basically incapable of fidelity. Though a contradiction to her treatment of Silvius' cause, Rosalind's knowing subscription to pessimistic views on the constancy of a man's love places her on the same playing field as many modern women.<br />Rosalind takes charge of her own fate. Until and even during Shakespeare's own time women largely were at the mercy of the men around them. This is satirized in Rosalind's assuming the appearance of a man. Yet she had taken charge of her life even before taking on the dress and likeness of a man. She gives her token to Orlando. She decides to go to the Forest. She makes the choice of appearing like a man to ensure her safety and the safety of Celia.<br />Rosalind finally finds balance and happiness when she comes to love not as a test or game, but as an equal partnership. Shakespeare is clearly critiquing the contemporary notions of love in his day. His play also condemns society's underestimation and marginalization of women. However, the Bard's main point is more profound.<br />As You Like It makes it clear that the world is never picture perfect, even when there are fairy-tale endings. Men and women both fail. Love is the most important thing. With love all things are possible.on of women.

I presented on Frederick Buechner. My focus was on his novel, On the Road with the Archangel. While preparing for this, I found myself reading seven of his other books. Once I picked him up, it was hard to put him down. One of the books that I read was Telling the Truth. I have recently had the pleasure of re-reading it.<br />Buechner is a shameless recycler of themes and material (King Lear references are found almost everywhere in his writings). Most of his books don't even break one hundred pages. Still, I'd rather sort through Buechner's recyclables than the seven course meals of a lot of other writers.<br />Telling the Truth is the printed form of lectures Buechner gave on what it means to preach the gospel. He argues that the gospel must be presented in terms of tragedy, comedy, and fairy tale.<br />The gospel is tragedy because life can be exceedingly dark. We spend so much time trying to pretend, and sometimes believing that everything is fine and dandy. Yet sin is real and it causes death. We all live under the horror of a death sentence that will not be commuted. We live in the valley of the shadow of death. To try and deny this is not to preach but to play games. Too many Christ-followers try to skip over this integral part of life.<br />The picture Buechner paints of Jesus' silence before Pilate is jarring. It makes me uncomfortable. It must have freaked Pilate out too. This silence and the silence before the preacher speaks are the personification of what the tragedy of the Gospel is. We have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. The wage of this \\"missing of the mark\\" is death.<br />The Gospel is comedy because God's provision for those who are his enemies is beyond the pale. It is in this hour of death--in the hour of our just execution--that God comes and gives us a life beyond all of our dreams and expectations.<br />The picture of Sarah's laughter at God's promise is the picture of our reaction when we first truly encounter the Gospel. A woman giving birth as she enters her second century of life looks easy compared to a God that we have slandered, rebelled against, ignored and even crucified loving us and redeeming us.<br />It is the hyper-reality of this comedy that makes the Gospel a fairy tale. We live in the drudgery of our everyday \\"real\\" lives. Yet the Gospel is more real than any of the fleeting, fading images that pass for our reality.<br />Buechner uses the picture of the Great Oz to convey the fairy-tale aspect of the Gospel. Just as Oz turns out to be a little old man behind a curtain, so the preacher's proclaiming of the wonder of the Kingdom looks insignificant, a lot of the time ridiculous, compared to the truth they bear.<br />The fairy tale of the Gospel is that all us, though seemingly frail and cowering behind the curtain of our lives, turn out to have power through Christ. The things we say and do while carrying the Gospel do indeed have eternal impact.<br />The Gospel must not be neutered by the understatement or ignoring of any of its elements. Sin has made our situation dire. God's provision has given us joy. The entire story offers us wonder.<br />I appreciate Buechner's Telling the Truth because he is creative in the making of his points. He paints vivid pictures. He does not soft-sell any element of his argument. This is a great book.<br />I give it my full recommendation.br />The picture of Sarah's laughter at God's promise is the picture of our reaction when we first truly encounter the Gospel.

Okonkwo despises his father because of the shame his lazy ways bring to his family. Okonkwo determines to be nothing like his father. With the exception of the brief time in which he comes to love Ikemefuma, he succeeds. Okonkwo gains fame in Umofia for being everything his father was not: hardworking, a man of stature, and concerned with the business of the community.<br />Okonkwo's rejection of his father, Unoka, is an act of social self-preservation. It also becomes a form of self-hatred. His denial of the parts of his father that exist inside himself makes him famous and revered. It is also his undoing as a human.<br />On the surface all seems well. Under the surface Okonkwo is a boiling mess of bottled emotion and impaired judgment. His determination to not be like Unoka causes him to put public appearance over internal intuition. This leads directly to his slaughtering of Ikemefuma. It also costs Okonkwo whatever humanity he may have had.<br /><br />This incident robs Okonkwo of any ability to deal sanely with the changes taking place in his society. His rage breaks upon the immovable rocks of colonial power. In his final futility, he becomes totally unlike his father--who at least enjoyed life.<br /><br />The things Okonkwo's homeland of Umofia reveres in their \\"great men\\" (and they are all men) are things that lend themselves to the preservation of people. Qualities like strength, the ability to create wealth (yams), and adherence to social and religious norms are all valued.<br /><br />Okonkwo manically lives out these qualities in an attempt to not become a \\"failure\\" like his father. Though Okonkwo's heartlessness manifests itself a few times, and some of his fellow villagers notice it, his greatness is already established in his titles and past actions. The unease of others is set aside in acknowledgement of his actions.<br /><br />This position Okonkwo has achieved falls apart the first time with his accidentally killing another. Yet even here, after he has, so to speak, \\"paid his debt to society\\"--he is allowed to return, his status is intact. This return and the change in society that has taken place in the interim, leads to the second, permanent \\"falling apart.\\"<br /><br />Okonkwo returns to a society being reshaped by the principles and, more importantly, resources of colonialism. In the face of the vast wealth and power of the colonial government the basis for Okonkwo's greatness looks rather silly and pathetic. What are yams in the face of guns?<br /><br />Okonkwo's status dissolves into irrelevance as his society moves on. All that he has accomplished in his life washes away in the face of those who have more. The grass withers, the flower fades and Okonkwo's greatness goes with it.<br /><br />The two white missionaries who come to Umofia, Mr. Brown and Mr. Smith, represent two very different worldviews. One (Brown) is a true-blue, \\"the last shall be first, the greatest is the least among you\\" kind of Christ-Follower. The other (Smith) represents the masses who crucify the true Christ in the name of co-opting the ways and power of those who are in charge of the temporal world.<br /><br />Brown is a missionary with zeal for the lost. Not only that, he evidences a desire to help lift up the down-trodden of Umofia's society. In the face of aggression from the people of Umofia, he attempts to lovingly turn aside their wrath. In all this, Brown shows himself (by his love for others) to be a follower of Christ.<br /><br />Smith on the other hand is a lackey of the state. His concern is not the condition of the souls of the people of Umofia. His concern is that no one \\"rock the boat\\" of colonial society.  He has no inner restraint in dealing with the problems he finds in Umofia. The smallest gnat of a problem is met with the crushing hammer of the colonial power at his disposal.<br /><br />Of course there are more temporal dangers in truly following Christthan in debasing oneself before earthly power. Smith's ways show results, Brown's largely do not. The difference is in the audience they are performing for. I choose Brown's.<br />I give Things Fall Apart my heartfelt recommendation.before earthly power. Smith's ways show results, Brown's largely do not.

In its tone, its narrative devices, and in the world it presents, this is a work that is clearly &quot;other&quot; from traditional Western fare. While sharing the same structural shell as the Western novel, its story is largely outside the limits of Western expectation.<br /><br />At its heart, As I Crossed a Bridge of Dreams is a song sung in retrospect by Lady Sarashina. This is a song of denied dreams that always just barely seem to fail.<br /><br />The one constant of the narrative is sadness. Whether Sarashina's life was really so melancholy or whether she wrote this looking back through the lens of bitterness is speculation. Yet the sadness is palpable. Sadness hovers over each scene. When happiness breaks in, it is an unexpected and short-lived guest.<br /><br />The narrative covers most of Sarashina's life. It starts in her childhood and leads up to her later years. She lives a very sheltered life in her father's house. So much so that it, in some ways, could be described in non-religious terms as a cloister. All the young Sarashina has to occupy her time is her love of tales and the hope of a more fulfilling future.<br /><br />The genesis of Sarashina's great unhappiness is the glimpse she gets of the greater life around her--a life that she is never capable of partaking in. In all her travels she is never able to break free from her own internal solitude. She will not allow herself to live in anything more than a &quot;dream.&quot;<br /><br />For me, the extremely episodic nature of the book made it hard to get deeply involved as a reader. There were long spaces in this book where the author dwelt on seemingly unimportant matters. There are also quite a few brief sections where the author skips ahead a number of years. This made things difficult for me to follow on a number of occasions.<br /><br />The one part of the book that I enjoyed was the poetry. I greatly enjoyed the poem that the author's father had his daughter compose to send to his ex-wife. The moment was both touching and insightful into their relationship.<br /><br />The native Japanese worldview was wholly foreign to me. All the pilgrimages, priests, nuns, and what I would term &quot;superstitions&quot; struck me as convoluted and semi-capricious. The mother's taking of vows while still living within the house, yet being separated from the household, was a truly odd moment.<br /><br />Though sometimes hopeful, Sarashina has no true hope. In its place Sarashina resigns herself to the idea that all the bad things happening to her are the result of Karma.<br /><br />I have a hard time swallowing this much hopelessness. There is an endless sense of wallowing about As I Crossed a Bridge of Dreams. I wanted to talk to Sarashina--to tell her that no matter how deep the darkness, it only takes one point of light to dispel it.<br />While this book may have value in being representative of the Japanese Literature of its day, it is not something I would choose to read again.

It is well written, moving, and thought-provoking. It is also often poorly taught and discussed.<br />Too many people who discuss this book would lump it into the genre of naturalistic fiction. They argue that Bigger, like the characters of authors like Dreiser and Lewis, is constrained by his environment. These commentators would rob the character of Bigger of his ability to determine his own fate.<br />Bigger Thomas, no matter how constrained by circumstance, is his own master. His decisions, not his surroundings or heredity determine his fate.<br />Biggers mother is depicted as upstanding, hardworking, loving and Christian. Biggers mother loves and is greatly concerned for her oldest son. She provides as stable of a home setting as is possible in her circumstances. She is perceptive enough to see that Biggers life outside of the home is the true threat to her sons well being, it is for this reason that she sets Bigger up with a great job for a person with his record.<br />Here Wright allows us see Biggers first set of choices. Rather than be grateful to his mother, Bigger goes out on the town with his fellow criminal friends who he then alienates by being excessively domineering and cruel. He then takes the job because he has nothing to do. Even here, Bigger brings the massive chip on his shoulder to his new setting.<br />Bigger chooses to see the worst in people (there is always plenty to seeno matter where you are). Rather than try and understand his employers desire to help the unfortunate, Bigger sees condescension. Rather than taking Jans friendship for what it is worth, he sees the political motive of Jans friendliness.<br />One can argue that the book bears out Biggers suspicions. After all, when everything comes down most of the whites do in fact only see a black monster. Yet this begs the question: Was Bigger truly doomed by his heredity and social status? The answer to this is a qualified no. Bigger still had choices. The fact that he made all the wrong ones does not mean that he had to.<br />In a sense, Bigger, as black person in the Chicago ghettos of the early twentieth century was indeed doomed to having far less options than his white counterparts. Wright condemns such a plight. He unmasks the racism of even the most well-intentioned whites. Yet I believe Wrights societal critique also exposes Biggers other options. The two alternatives we are blatantly presented with are the causes.<br />Bigger could have escaped in the cause of Communism. He could have made his life (even his crimes and punishment) worth something in the context of the great struggle as envisioned by Mr. Max. The flaw here is one of what then of Bigger? Bigger gets to make a profound statement, perhaps betters the world for others, but what does it get Bigger?<br />The other cause Bigger could have escaped into was his mothers rather pietistic, reward-in-the-next-world form of Christianity.  Again, the problem with this is one of what of this life? Should Bigger sit on his oppressed hands and wait to die?<br />The problem with both of the causes Bigger is presented with is that they do nothing for the here and now. They were offered (at least with any force) too late. These great causes, with the exception of Biggers mother, cared little for Bigger until he was surrounded by all the hoopla of his trial. So, once again--was Biggers fate predetermined by circumstance?<br />Biggers final moments are filled with a vain dream partly born by his misinterpretation of Mr. Maxs final address to him. Nevertheless, it is clear that however buried, Biggers dream had previously existed in him. Bigger claims that his dream was the motivation for his crimes--in which case it would have existed long before any philosophy had tainted the picture.<br />Just as Nietzsche says bad men have no songs (how is it then that the Russians have songs) how is it that this automaton of location and genes has dreams? If he dreams then must he not decide whether or not to act on such dreams?<br />It is Biggers consistent failure to choose his dreams that leads to his nightmare. Perhaps he is paralyzed by the vagueness of his dream. Bigger knows what he does not want to do. He cannot decide on nor do what he wants. Even his one seemingly fulfilled action--the murder of his girlfriend--turns out to have failed.<br />This condition of indecisiveness is allegorically dealt with in Biggers repeated putting off of cleaning the furnace of Mary Daltons ashes and bones. This procrastination is the reason why Bigger is eventually caught.<br />Dreams, indecision, pathos, and regret add up to a tragedy. This tragedy was not caused by environment or even race. Though race and position hinder Bigger, his fate has clearly not been written in the stars. His decisions are his alonenot the result of society. Others around him have chosen other, less destructive paths in life. The prosecuting attorney argues this implicitly in his case before the court (though it is tainted by a divisive racism).<br />Wright was clearly sympathetic with the lives of those who were living like Bigger. His aim was to shine a light on the lives that his less fortunate contemporaries were living in order to bring change. The fact that Wright saw this change as possible is the strongest argument against Biggers story being one dictated by naturalistic constraints.<br />Native Son is a horrifying picture of a slice of American life that too many people experience. Reading it without an acknowledgement of Biggers ability to act for himself does nothing to strengthen Wrights argument. This is a great American novel that should be read honestly--with intellectual blinders off.<br />I give Native Son my highest recommendation.no songs (how is it then that the Russians have songs) how is it that this automaton of location and genes has dreams?

A group of unsuspecting strangers drawn to the town must survive their encounter with this force and in the process make a decision that will forever change their lives.<br />King's set-up to this story is long, gruesome, and grim. There are parts that any decent person will recoil from--as they should. The evil in this book is not glamorous; it is evil in its most fallen and base form.<br />Once the dark 'collecting' of the opening is through, the novel finally hits full stride. Good appears in the most unexpected form. Evil is engaged in a battle to the death.<br />Usually 'good vs. evil' type novels suffer from too much of a 'black and white' didactic moralism. The beauty of Desperation is that the heroes of the novel must first engage the evil and  good within themselves before they can lift a finger to fight the real enemy. King never fails to amaze me with the craft of his words and his honest description of the glory and shame of being human.<br />Desperation is a stand alone novel. However, it ties in (as do many of King's novels) with the Dark Tower series. It also has a bizarro 'sister book' in the late Richard Bachman's The Regulators.<br />I give Desperation my heartfelt, highest recommendation--don't be scared off by a little blood and guts. There is a lot of despair, desperation and cruelty in these pages. There is also faith, hope, and most importantly--love.	2003-03-13

You have to keep going on--no matter how the author drones through fifty pages of needless verbosity--you will, in the end, find the jewel that you had hoped to discover in picking up the book. Such is the case with the letters of Thomas Lovell Beddoes.<br />Though one jewel (a description of Shakespeare) comes early--<br />\\"'A star' you call him. If he was a star, all the other stage scribblers can hardly be considered a constellation of brass buttons.\\"<br />--others are buried deep within. Yet with Beddoes, the mining is half the fun. Try staying awake, much less interested in the prose works of certain other Romantics.<br />Thomas Beddoes was a rather death-obsessed author who unfortunately never figured out that it only takes one point of light to dispel the deepest darkness. Yet for all that, I find a very human persona that is not the least bit inaccessible in his letters. In fact he is, to me at least, very engaging.<br />Do yourself a favor: pick up a copy of Beddoes' letters and make the acquaintance of this wonderful and tragic man.	2003-03-05

The more I read by Stephen King, the more entranced I become by his work as a whole. In particular, I have come to seek out the various threads of the Dark Tower that are woven through many of his books. Rose Madder, which does indeed weave itself into King's masterwork (while maintaining its viability as a \\"stand-alone\\" novel) is a masterpiece.<br />Norman Daniels, though thoroughly human, is a monster more horrible that many of King's worst beasts. Cujo has nothing on him when it comes to ferocity. Annie Wilkes looks downright domestic when compared to Normie.<br />Yet evil is not the whole name of the game in Rose Madder. It is more of a story about finding life-even in the shadow of death. Norman's wife Rose is a character for the ages (one of King's greatest creations)-and in spite of Norman-this is her story.<br />I don't want to give away too much of this wonderful story. Rose Madder is a masterpiece of gradual revelation. So rather than sucking the life out of it, I'll just make a few random comments:<br />First, I give this book my full recommendation. There are scenes of horrid nastiness here...yet there are also moments of great hope and beauty. King captures a great truth of life in this.<br />Rose Madder has some wonderfully developed minor characters (one of which becomes a big character in one of King's later novels-Desperation). One character-Gert, is my all time favorite \\"King\\" minor character. She sends Norman a great \\"message.\\"<br />I must finally note that the audio version of this book is wonderfully done by both King (Norman's Perspective) and Blair Brown (Rose's Perspective). Rose Madder is certainly not King's most \\"important\\" or even representative novel. That said--it still gets my five stars.	2003-02-26

There is no book that I have reviewed this year that I recommend more highly.<br />This is the story of Martin. Martin is a Russian man who spends his days mending shoes and his nights in the pleasurable reading of the Bible. One night, after reading how a rich man invited Jesus to stay at his house, Martin wishes that he could invite Jesus to his house and wonders what he would do if Jesus actually showed up.<br />The rest of the book is the story of what happens when Jesus comes. It is a story told with wonderfully spare language. Mrs. Watts' beautiful illustrations add to the warm feeling of this wintery tale.<br />There are few things I have ever reviewed that I recommend more than Shoemaker Martin--get this book!	2002-11-24

This book--Reversed Thunder: The Revelation of John and the Praying Imagination, has done just as much (and more) than Answering God.<br />Reversed Thunder has truly awakened my imagination. It has turned how I approach the Word of God on its head (I don't even feel like I approach it anymore--it approaches me). For the first time in my life, I feel that the Bible is not just some mystic book that speaks from somewhere in the mists of the past--it is living (how many times had I heard that and given mere intellectual assent?) and speaking to me always.<br />Each chapter of this book is vital. Eugene Peterson has distilled the lessons of a lifetime in these pages--they are transformative. As an aside, I read Brigitte Hanhart's children's adaptation of Tolstoy's Shoemaker Martin while I was reading Reversed Thunder--the messages of these books powerfully reinforce one another (in other words: I strongly recommend reading them together).<br />I give Reversed Thunder my highest recommendation.	2002-11-24

Those who are blown away by Pullman's supposedly masterful creation should pick it up first in its original versions--Milton's Paradise Lost, Lewis' Out of the Silent Planet andBlake's Prophetic Books.<br />For what it was, I found the Amber Spyglass a predictable end ...to a rather predictable series. <br />I found myself wishing Will and Mary well. As for Lyra-- I can't say I really ever liked her. So, for the Gyptians' sake--and more importantly Scorseby's--I'll wish her well anyway.<br />Really, this is the worst of the three books in the series (they get worse in descending order).

Take caution though. This book is like a good first date--it might be fun, but if you keep going without looking too closely, you're gonna end up involved with an unsavory character.<br />As for the book itself:<br />It is a derivative (shades of Milton, Blake, Lewis and Yeats here) yet entertaining adventure. A little girl (of questionable nature) gets wrapped up in events that end up dragging her across the vastness of the Polar regions on an alternate Earth. There she finds adventure, friendship, triumph and tragedy.<br />Pullman creates some wonderful side characters, most notably the great armored bear Iorek Byrnison, the sharpshooting Texan Lee Scoresby, and the witch queen Serafina Pekkala.<br />For abject terror, one cannot beat the scene Pullman has written in his Bolvangar.<br />Yet, for as good as this book gets, there are glimpses even here in the first book of how politically correct and preachy (one might also throw in blasphemous) Pullman eventually gets in the second and third books of the series. The scene between Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter is the prime example here.<br />Therefore--since this book is little more than a beautifully paved road to nowhere--I don't recommend it.	2002-11-03

It was a major disappointment for me. The Golden Compass was a half-decent novel. It kept me spellbound (if suspicious) for the length of the book. Not so here.<br />First of all, it starts off on a new thread to the story--that of Will. Will's a nice enough kid. He loves his mother, longs to see his dad, and is able to hold up pretty well when confronted by some X-files-ish dark agents.<br />But Will's not the problem with the book.<br />Neither are the witches. If Pullman had thrown us a bone with the witches, and made them less peripheral in at least one of the three books, maybe that would have been something. But nope, not enough witches.<br />However...the main problem is not the witches either.<br />It is a combination of four things:<br />-Too much Lyra. Is she a hero, a fool, a ceaseless whiner, or a brat? At the end of this book I could answer yes to three of these things. Guess which one didn't make my list? (The Alethiometer will not tell you).<br />-No plot cohesion. Reading this book felt like watching an episode of Barry Levinson's old TV show Homicide--way two much swirling on the handheld.<br />-Impending inanity. I won't go into Pullman's misguided one-sidedness and lack of vision--but the more he lays out his politically correct ideals and quibbles with the worst that has been man-made religion, the less story this story becomes. It becomes a sermon--and sermons aren't for reading.<br />-Iorek Byrnison. Pullman made me love this guy in book one. Then he almost completely drops him in book two.<br />The one redeeming scene in this book (that almost makes the story worth it) is the final scene with Lee Scoresby. Here Pullman shows just how much potential he is squandering on the weaker parts of this book and its horrid successor.<br />Even with this one great scene, I do not recommend the Subtle Knife.	2002-11-03

I first picked it up while following the reading guide at the end of Lindskoog's Mere Christian. I thought it would be a fun read during valentine's season. One often is most vulnerable to the trap when one is not alert...<br />And so, once more, C.S. Lewis has changed my thought on a broad portion of life. He's done it to me before--the Narnian Books, Mere Christianity, An Experiment In Criticism--have all been books that have greatly shaped me. Now I can add the Four Loves to the list.<br />One does not often sit down and ponder the different kinds of love. One may have generalized \\"loved ones\\" such as family and friends, we may \\"love\\" certain activities or places, we may even say we are \\"in love\\" ... but do we stop to consider our words?<br />Lewis spends time surveying the lay of love's different lands. Building on blocks of seemingly deepening emotion, he moves from looking at affection to friendship to erotic love (Eros) to the love of God (Agape). Each is looked at in detail, their meaning and impact on life is explored.<br />The most helpful thing about this book is that Lewis allows the reader to think about how they deal with their own loves in life. Does one stress a certain kind of love in an unhealthy way? Do we ignore the possibilities of one love because another kind holds too much sway in our lives?<br />I believe Lewis makes the case that God's love should be primary in the lives of humans. The other loves, though they can be wonderful in their place, can be used unnaturally and ineffectively to try and fill in for Agape if it is not felt. A healthy life will involve all four loves. Yet they must be rooted and grounded in Agape.<br />My own favorite passage in this book is in the friendship section. Dispelling the myth that an intense friendship between two people is always the best, Lewis notes that after his friend Charles (Williams) died, his friendship with J.R.R. Tolkien was something less than it was when Charles was still around--he could no longer appreciate Tolkien through the eyes of Williams. The passage is personal, poignant, and true to my own experience.<br />The Four Loves is a remarkable book. I give it my full recommendation.R.

It may be a tad long for some, but I have greatly enjoyed this massive epic of the North.<br />I have always had a love-hate relationship with the great Norse Sagas. They are full of wonder and discovery. They can also be somewhat one-dimensional. Perhaps it is something that gets lost in translation.<br />Mirsky captures all the wonder and adventure of the ancient Norse landscape while at the same time somehow bringing to his tale of Sigtrygg to fully three dimensional life. What a great journey this tale is!<br />I know that my enthusiasm for this book will no doubt be taken with a grain of salt by those predisposed to overlook of Norse literature as a regional oddity. Such a dismissive view would be a crime. It would be like never reading Tolkien because one does not enjoy books with dragons and elves.<br />Is Mirsky a new Tolkien? No. And I doubt he has ever intended to be. Is he a very good writer who has made an exceptional book? Yes. And you should read it.<br />I give The King of Vinland's Saga my heartfelt recommendation.	2002-10-28

Portraits of Success: 9 Keys to Sustaining Value in Any Business is a book that deserves--and will hopefully get--a large readership.<br /><br />Drawing on what he has seen in his own family business' transition to second generation leadership, as well as what he has witnessed as a consultant on such transitions, Hutcheson gives the reader much to think about. As he makes each point in his \\"9 Keys\\" he illustrates it with a real-life example.<br />Many of the keys are basic but easy to overlook and (after having overlooked them) sometimes tricky to introduce in a static leadership environment. Yet Hutcheson is a faithful guide through the peaks and valleys.<br />Having suffered through encounters with ineffective organizations (my daughter's school) and reveled in being a part of an effective, on-purpose organization (my Church), I cannot stress enough how important it is for people in leadership positions to be intentional in what they do and have the ability to be life-long learners. Learning about leadership and listening to those who \\"have been there,\\" like Mr. Hutcheson, is a big part of this. Nothing less is in the balance than the difference between a life of drudgery and one of joy and freedom.<br />My only critique of this book is one that springs from my Christianity. I feel that the missing tenth (and possibly most important key) is Spiritual giftedness. When people serve in an area they not only enjoy, but also are gifted by God to serve in, explosive results are to be had. Also, as part of the Kingdom, \\"Business Traditions, Myths, and Shared Beliefs\\" melt away in the face of the kind of common purpose given by the Great Commission and the whole history of salvation.<br />Bearing this in mind and also recognizing that Mr. Hutcheson's audience probably have not all partaken of the Kingdom as of yet, I have to say that this book does a darn good job as a whole. It is less of a compilation of other sources than are most other leadership books. I found it refreshing to be able to distinguish an actual authorial voice in a work such as this. Too many leadership books read like a cross between a presentation and an instruction manual.<br />Get this book. It is well worth the time spent reading.s book does a darn good job as a whole.

Out of the hundreds to thousands of children's books written every year, maybe one or two (in a good year) retain a large audience. The Polar Express is one of these rare volumes--and deservedly so.<br />Chris Van Allsburg's holiday classic is full of lovely illustrations. One can feel the chill of a long ago Christmas Eve, the warmth of the inside of the train, the vastness of the Polar landscape. Yet, the real attraction with The Polar Express is its timeless, haunting story. Like the last echoing strains of the sweetest ringing bell, this story will stay with you long after you are done reading.<br />With all the \\"stuff\\" that has come to surround and obscure Christmas--this story, of a boy who finds wonder in the face of surrounding disbelief, is a perfect book to read during the season.<br />I give it my full recommendation.	2002-10-24

It is well written (it has an amazing economy of words). It provokes thought and discussion.<br />Likely the most important thing about The Bones of Fred McFee is that it is incredibly well illustrated. The illustrator of this book has what I call \\"a voice.\\" Too many illustrators lack their own voice. They often suffer from being too derivative or too like other illustrators. This phenomenon is, for some reason, particularly common in Halloween books.<br />That is not the case here. Kurt Cyrus' pictures in The Bones of Fred McFee are brilliant, clean, and not overbearing. The spookiness is left up to the words for the most part--as it should be.<br />This story, about some kids who hang a fake skeleton (which they name) for Halloween should, in a just world, become a holiday classic. The eerie results and mysterious fate of the skeleton makes for an entertaining and haunting tale.<br />I give The Bones of Fred McFee a high recommendation.	2002-10-16

After the Letters From a Nut books, I have come to expect a lot from Jerry Seinfeld the author. The first question to be answered is: \\"can a format like the one used in his new Halloween book deliver as many laughs as the Nut books?\\" The obvious answer is no. It is too short. That said, Halloween is still mighty funny.<br />This book is not for younger kids. They might laugh at some of the goofier illustrations, but the humor is more teenaged than child-oriented (unless your kids are already jaded at an extremely young age).<br />Seinfeld draws most of the comedy in Halloween from the yearly quest for candy. No ghosts or ghouls haunt the pages of this book--unless you count sugar addiction and greed. Three words sum up the book quite nicely: candy, candy, candy.<br />All in all, Halloween is a fun and entertaining book. A classic? Probably not.	2002-10-16

I accepted a review copy because the author's request was more cogent and well written than most I receive. I am almost sad to have to fulfill my duty of reviewing the book.<br />Let me say first that Julian Winter is indeed a very talented writer. Some of his descriptive passages put a lot of more famous and widely read authors to shame. Parts of this book communicate a greater reality behind creation than many now alive ever notice.<br />Yet...<br />I could not help feeling that I was walking a moral tightrope by even reading some of the stuff this book contains. To use the words of a man named Peter: as great as some of the writing here was, \\"these are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm.\\"<br />All too often, what passes for the \\"spiritual\\" in T'ongil is a mere hyper-glorification of fleshly existence. It is as if the author has maybe seen the real picture of reality, yet has been limited to a close-up of its most plain and dusty corner.<br />I cannot recommend T'ongil.	2002-10-16

I have come to expect so much from John Scieszka and Lane Smith. I hoped that a book about an alien student trying to explain what happened to his homework (especially when the story begins with the alien child being abducted by other aliens) would be a great platform to showcase the talents of this team. It sadly has not proved so.<br />Baloney, Henry P. suffers from both poor illustrations and a lack of humor. The plot line is forced rather than well laid out. These are aberrations in the work of Scieszka/Smith.<br />In the interests of not judging others too harshly (lest I, as a result, am left without excuse) I must point out that the sheer invention and novelty of this book makes it worth reading at least once. The basis for my extremely low rating is that this book is not even close to being up to par with the other work of Scieszka and Smith. It isn't even in the same league as works like The Stinky Cheese Man and The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs.<br />Unless you are a big fan of Scieszka and Smith, I recommend that you look somewhere else (the aforementioned books or Math Curse).

In my opinion, this book is even better than the first book, \\"War in Heaven,\\" which I greatly enjoyed.<br />First of all--the story. Beale brings this second book down to earth. Instead of a rampaging war that crosses the boundaries of planets and time (though that war is still the backdrop), the setting of The Word in Shadow is an average suburban high school.<br />Jami, Christopher and Holli are confronted by a largely unfelt and unseen threat. They are given the chance to save many lives and eternal destinies. The question is: do they have enough resolve and faith to do so?<br />The answer will likely surprise you (it did me).<br />Now--to the writer. I have been most impressed by Mr. Beale as an author. His development from his first novel to his second is phenomenal. What strikes me most is his dead-on ability to catch the dialogue and culture of his characters. There are few writers who come close to his ability at this.<br />More than that, he is writing not only page-turning stuff, but page-turning stuff with a brain. His depiction of his human villains (or victims--depends how you look at it) does not suffer from the usual one-sidedness one finds in \\"Christian\\" literature.<br />For all these reasons and for the fact that once I got a hundred pages into it, I could not put the book down, I give The World in Shadow my highest recommendation.<br />One last thing--I also appreciated Mr. Beale's nod to Douglas Adams in the naming of one of the novel's characters.	2002-10-07

As a child, I was one who couldn't get enough of its wonder. Santa was a huge part of this feeling.<br />Yet time passes, wonder fades. Knowledge drives out belief. The world grows hard and dull.<br />The greatness of The Bearer of Gifts is that it tells two tales wrapped together in one story. The wondrous truth of Christmas and its meaning are expressed in a fun remaking and retelling of Santa's story. Fused together, this creates an honest little book that haunts the memory even as it delights the soul.<br />The retelling of the story of Santa Claus is brilliant. Wrapped in the icy mists of its Lapland setting, it is an invigorating blast of cold that gives the tale of Santa a new freshness. Any staleness brought about by the constant retelling of the Santa story is blown away by Steven Kenneth's stark vision.<br />This Santa story is masterfully woven into the true meaning of Christmas--the Free Gift of God to all people in His Son. Santa leaves his home in Lapland to follow a star across the winter sky. His journeys take him far from home--the foot of a stable.<br />The Bearer of Gifts is a book that is both simple and profound. Its loving illustrations and spare language make it something truly special. This book peels back layers of obscurity and heartless commercialization that have dulled the meaning of Christmas in the heart of many.<br />Christmas is a time of wonder. If its wonder has grown cold in your heart, I can think of no greater way to rekindle it than to curl up with this book on a winter's night. I give The Bearer of Gifts a strong recommendation.	2002-10-07

They introduce to me to areas of life that I otherwise might never have encountered. Other Traditions by John Ashbery is just such a book.<br />I have always had a love for, but limited knowledge of, Poetry. It was Edward Hirsch's great book How to Read a Poem and Fall in Love with Poetry that first introduced me to Ashbery's work. He is, in my opinion, one of the greatest living poets. Therefore, I jumped at the opportunity to read Other Traditions.<br />Other Traditions is the book form of a series of lectures given by Ashbery on other poets. Ashbery writes about six of the lesser-known artists who have had an impact on his own life and work. All of them are fascinating. They are:<br />-John Clare, a master at describing nature who spent the last 27 years of his life in an Asylum.<br />-Thomas Lovell Beddoes, a rather death obsessed author (he ended up taking his own life) whose greatest poetry consists of fragments that must often be culled from the pages of his lengthy dramas.<br />-Raymond Roussel, a French author whose magnum opus is actually a book-length sentence.<br />-John Wheelwright, a politically engaged genius whose ultra-dense poetry even Ashbery has a hard time describing or comprehending.<br />-Laura Riding, a poet of great talent and intellect who chose to forsake poetry (check out the copyright page).<br />-David Schubert, an obscure poet who Ashbery feels is one of the greatest of the Twentieth Century.<br />The two that I was most pleasantly surprised by are Clare and Riding.<br />Clare has become (since I picked up a couple of his books) one of my favorite poets. He is a master at describing rural life. I know of no one quite like him. Ashbery's true greatness as a critic comes out when he depicts Clare as \\"making his rounds.\\"<br />Riding, on the other hand, represents the extreme version of every author's desire for the public to read their work in a precise way--the way the author intends it to be read. Her intense combativeness and sensitivity to criticism is as endearing as it is humorous.<br />Other Traditions has given me a key to a whole new world of books. For that I am most grateful.<br />I give this book my full recommendation.--the way the author intends it to be read.

This moves the student from a general grasp of a thing to an attentiveness to the precise way God has made himself known--there is nothing quite like it.<br />As other reviewers have noted, this is probably not a good place for beginners hoping to do a word study to jump in. I'd recommend Vine's for that. I also recommend that those serious in the study of Biblical Greek use this book in conjunction with a Greek New Testament, Mr. Mounce's Grammar (his lexicon is handy too), and Zerwick's Grammatical Analysis. This broad group of tools should help keep you from falling pray to a single interpretive spin.<br />Don't let its size and price scare you off--this book is essential for the student of Biblical Greek.	2002-09-19

It starts grim and only gets blacker... ...It is one of Shakespeare's better plays<br />Macbeth is one of Shakespeare's more ambiguous main characters. Motivation is always a big question with him. Sure, he is hungry for power. Yet he also needs prodding from several quarters to take most of his actions.<br />Lady Macbeth is really no different. She comes off as eager for evil early on, but is utterly shocked by its repercussions. Her attempt to go against nature leaves her absolutely unhinged and thirsting after guidance--only to find despair. In this regard, Shakespeare anticipates the psychology of Dostoevsky.<br />Macbeth is also one of Shakespeare's most supernatural plays. Regardless of whether one wants to debate the reality of Banquo's ghost, there are forces at work in Macbeth that are often unseen, but which drive the plot. The witches and all the unnaturalness come up against the forces of nature (the trees) and the divinely appointed King.<br />The most remarkable thing about this play is, for me at least, that it becomes a true tragedy only in its last moments. Only when all the stuff has hit the fan, and he has realized his doom is eminent, does Macbeth show the courage and nobility of a true tragic hero.<br />Macbeth is a great place to start if you are new to Shakespeare. It is a fun place to return if you're not.	2002-09-12

Too often they do all the work for the participant. They remind me of the regurgitated food a mother bird feeds her children--enough to sustain, but growth doesn't really happen till we're booted out of the nest. That said, Jan Johnson's &quot;Listening to God&quot; is one of the exceptions.<br />Though Johnson walks us to the right spot in the field and gives us the best shovel, the digging is left to us. What a rich field it is...<br />More so than any study I have yet read, Listening to God has called me to reflection and prayer. Truly having God's voice wash over me has transformed my life. I have learned to wait and be still before the One who loves me most.<br />Johnson's methods are not new. This guide teaches us one of the greatest spiritual disciplines known to Christ-followers throughout the centuries--Lectio Divina (don't be scared by the big, Latin sounding term...it only means divine reading). The participants in the study come not to debate or intellectually mull over the text. Instead, the text is savored, reflected on and prayed over.<br />For me, this has meant the texts have become a part of me. In the past I have tried to live out the &quot;applications&quot; of studies. I usually forgot what I was &quot;supposed&quot; to be doing in a few days. With this study, the words of the text have become grafted into me--more strongly rooted in my soul.<br />For that I must give Jan Johnson my deepest thanks and give &quot;Listening to God&quot; my highest recommendation.	2002-09-12

I've been expanding my reading in Children's and Young Adult literature of late. I have read some really great authors for the first time. One author who strikes me as particularly engaging is Lemony Snicket. His books have not only riveted the attention of my children, they have spoken to me at the same time but on a higher level.<br />In my experience, \\"The Bad Beginning,\\" the first in Snicket's \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" series, grabs the attention of children. They feel for the Baudelaire children. Their main reactions have been to the injustice of what the children are forced to go through. They celebrate the Baudelaire's eventual pseudo-triumph.<br />Yet all the while, what I relished in Snicket's writing was the dripping irony and sarcasm (the book is soaked in it). A particular joy for me was the narrator's simplifying definitions of big words for the kids...they serve to put quite a spin on things.<br />These books are rather short--you can read them in a day if you're adult (and they must make a fortune for the author). My wife has listened to books one and two on tape (read by the terrific Tim Curry) and says they are hysterical.<br />Getting unanimous approval for anything in my family is tough. So this book must either be pretty good or pretty weird. I think its both.<br />I recommend Lemony Snicket's \\"The Bad Beginning.\\"	2002-09-12

Buford's condescending assumption that people cannot hunger after and pursue the Kingdom of God at an early age is unbelievably obtuse and shallow. I usually don't waste my time on such drivel.

Rarely have I read a book that is so dead-on in its depiction of the petty concerns turned to obsession and often ingrown, self-righteous &quot;worldly&quot; provincialism that is higher academia. Robertson Davies has perfectly captured all the head spinning egotism and resulting humor (so ready for those not wrapped up in themselves or their work to discover) that is always lurking within its ivy-covered halls.<br />At its core, &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; is the story of the trials and joys that a student assistant to a medieval literature instructor goes through as she works with &quot;the great man.&quot; Most of these trials (and a couple of the joys) arrive in the form of John Parlabane. It is Parlabane's return that sets off the action of the plot. It is his departure that sets off its resolution.<br />&quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; is one of those rare books that has a plot so intricate, and characters so unique that I do not wish to spoil it with too much elaboration here. Instead, I'd rather sing the praises of Davies as an author.<br />Davies is, first and foremost, a master of the English language. His turns of phrase are wonderfully expressive. They always hit the mark perfectly. Rarely has such a wit walked the Earth. In my opinion Davies is the greatest example of the classical definition of a &quot;wit&quot; since the time of Pope and Dryden. His mastery of language and wit make &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; a dangerously funny book. He had me laughing at some pretty awful things.<br />Yet, inspite of some of its more juvenile moments, &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; also contemplates some of the deeper things. The whole book serves to challenge our very modern, very empirical worldviews. Is all knowledge exclusively progressive? It'd be mighty vain to think so. &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; takes us to task for doing just that.<br />This is a great book. I give it my full recommendation.	2002-08-21

Lacking knowledge of the Architectural issues involved, I had to approach &quot;Athena and Eden&quot; with my experience of ancient and classical Greek literature. I was shocked by the strength and cogency of Mr. Johnson's arguments. Though not yet fully convinced of all of the conclusions Mr. Johnson has reached, &quot;Athena and Eden&quot; has definitely given me some ideas to chew on while Mr. Johnson writes his second volume.<br />Many near eastern/mediteraenean cultures exhibit shared memories of a common prehistory. From Gilgamesh in Mesopotamia to early tales of Osiris in Egypt, echoes of the Genesis and Flood stories abound. If Mr. Johnson is correct, than Greek mythology is a very twisted (possibly Satanic) retelling of the fall of Man.<br />As far as particulars--<br />I found his arguments about the true identity of the Zeus figure extremely compelling. Yet the Athena/Hera division is still a little muddled in my mind (probably more my fault than the author's).<br />Overall, &quot;Athena and Eden&quot; is a very intriguing book that deserves a lot of attention. It gets my recommendation.	2002-08-19

Ford tells Arthur that he is leaving Earth in order to escape its destruction (it is being destroyed in order to pave the way for an interstellar bypass).<br />So begins the epic that is Adams' magnum opus.<br />One reason I love The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (and the rest of the trilogy) is that it explores the theme of life as a journey towards hidden purposes. At the same time, it manages to show all the chaos along the way.<br />It is within the pages that we first encounter the answer to the meaning of life, the universe and everything--namely 42. The search for the question to the answer is preoccupies much of the trilogy's later stories.<br />After several readings of this first volume, the scene that sticks most in my mind is the internal conflicts that take place within the soul of the English bureaucrat (a direct male-line descendant of Ghengis Khan) sent to destroy Arthur's home. There are few scenes more hilarious in the rest of the series.<br />I give the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy my full recommendation.	2002-08-14

It is the story of how our Holy God (Namely Yahweh, His Son Jesus, and the Holy Spirit) has had and is having an ongoing love affair with humanity.<br />Faithful to us throughout all history, the Bible shows that God has loved us even as we have continually played the prostitute within our hearts.<br />The Old Testament shows us how God came to one nation in particular out of all the diseased and dying cultures of Earth and gave it instruction in healthy living. Yet the history books of the Old Testament show how like an angered, hungry infant, we swatted away the bottle of life when it was presented to us. The Prophets and the Psalms are filled with rebukes to the self-destructive people of the world. They are also full of the promise of a new day. Many passages of these books are filled with praise for God's deeds--past, present and future.<br />The Gospels are the story of how Jesus, God's Son, came to once and for all rescue mankind from itself and the world's unseen forces of evil. The book of Acts continues with the story of the wonders and sacrifices of the early Church. The letters address how we are to live as the people of God. The Revelation is one of the most beautiful and awesome pieces of literature ever written.<br />If you haven't read it lately (or ever), let me recommend the greatest book ever written. This New International Version would be particularly wonderful for those of you who once had a run-in with the Authorized or \\"King James\\" Version (don't worry, I couldn't make heads or tails of it either).<br />I have owned this particular format of the Bible (NIV Thinline Bonded Green Leather) for some time. It is sturdy as a warhorse.<br />Get this book!	2002-08-14

The fact that Beale is represented by the agents who serve a couple of the authors who write some of the books that have given me this negative impression did not speak well to me about the possibility of this book being any different (neither did the cheesy cover artwork-which will soon be thankfully remedied in the forthcoming trade paperback version). How wrong I was...<br />There are indeed things I do not like about \\"The War in Heaven.\\" Yet rarely has my heart cried out in joy over a book as it has with this one.<br />First, the bones I have to pick...<br />The biggest one is the representation of Kaym. Kaym is the fallen angel that mentors Christopher in the ways of darkness (or light--depending on who is to be believed). Kaym spews all kinds of Nietzschean drivel about power and freedom being beyond good and evil. This is not the part that I dislike. Having subscribed to such folly in my youth, I can see this being a decent angle for a fallen angel to take in the postmodern age. What bugs me about Kaym is his garb. Describing him as wearing Ray-bans is gonna date him, and possibly the book, really fast.<br />My second bone to pick is the way in which Jami and Holli talk. Beale has hit the nail of how American teens communicate on the head. His dialogue is spot-on. Yet restraint is a good thing. Perhaps a little less of the \\"ohmigod's\\" and the \\"like's\\" would have been a good thing too.<br />Bearing these two minor flaws in mind, I still have to give this book my highest recommendation.<br />Beale proves himself to be a master of imagery. I was surprised to find some truly great moments of what can only be described as mythopoeic storytelling in this book. Ahura Azdha is full of wonders. Beale's remolding of the words from the Bible's second book of Kings about Sennacherib's threats against Hezekiah and Jerusalem in the fictional siege of Chasah is sheer brilliance.<br />There is a whole lot of meat to this book. Biblical allusion, references to Milton's Paradise Lost, Apocryphal tales-\\"The War in Heaven\\" is a real treat. This is redemptive fiction at its most imaginative best.<br />I urge you to get this book.he fictional siege of Chasah is sheer brilliance.<br />There is a whole lot of meat to this book.

His conversation with the tank-like robot from Frogstar is a piece of comedic writing for the ages. Were it not for the insanity of Zaphod, the brilliance of Adams' depressed robot might stolen the whole show.<br />But oh--the mighty creation that is Zaphod Beeblebrox. Literature rarely produces such maniacal, unforgettable characters. His disdain for Arthur, his asides to Ford, his complete ineptitude in dealing with Trillian, and most of all--his strained relations with his ancestors. No, Marvin steals some scenes here...but this is Zaphod's book.<br />The range of Adams' satiric gifts never fails to astound me. The scene in Milliways speaks more effectively to the human condition than many sets of other volumes ever could. We all sit at the edge of oblivion every day. Are we to be mere spectators? Or will we work to create something more?<br />I give \\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\" my heartfelt recommendation.	2002-08-13

As far as comedic action goes, you cannot do better in the Hitchhiker's Trilogy than &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything.&quot; In this sense, it is tops in its series and has few peers elsewhere.<br />The book (the third in the five book trilogy) starts off a couple of years after &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.&quot; Arthur is still stranded in his prehistoric &quot;ship of fools&quot; society. By the end of the book, Arthur, Ford, Slartibartfast, Trilian, and Zaphod not only discover the gruesome origins of the game Cricket, but also manage to save the universe.<br />Possibly the funniest part of the whole series of books comes in chapter sixteen. Arthur encounters a beast named Agrajag who is convinced Arthur has murdered him in all his previous lives. The scene is not only hysterical but it also sets the stage for one of the biggest themes in book five: &quot;Mostly Harmless.&quot;<br />The bit about Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged was really funny too.<br />Adams was at the pinnacle of his comedic powers in this book. Its possibly the funniest thing he ever wrote. Reading through this series has made me mourn his early passing all the more.<br />I give &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot; my full recommendation.	2002-08-08

While there is every bit as much hilarious caper going on in this book as there was in the previous three, we get the added bonus of some great character development, a few of the most poignant moments in the entire series, and Marvin's moving farewell to life, the universe and everything.<br />We also discover God's final message to his creation.<br />Woven throughout all the other stuff of this story is a tale of Arthur falling in love. I was surprised by Adams' ability to write a great love story. Rarely have I encountered one as powerful in any form of popular fiction (the only other that deserved to stand with it is Stephen King's &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot;--but that's apples and tank treads).<br />Now that I've managed to blather ineffectively about this great book...just take my word. Get it. It is more than worth it.	2002-08-03

I only wish this had been another Dirk Gently book instead of a sometimes hilariously funny, yet all-too serious demolition of the happy ending of &quot;So Long and Thanks for All the Fish.&quot;<br />Alas.<br />Gone are Marvin (who dies at the end of the fourth book) and Fenchurch. In their stead we gain another Trilian (Patricia Macmillan actually), her daughter--Random Dent, and an unshakably happy robot named Colin. While I like Colin quite a bit, I could do without the other two.<br />In fact, I love the whole Ford Prefect storyline. Anything to do with Random is weighed down by too much maddened grimness (I think I just invented a word there...no matter).<br />The King, The Sandwich Maker,the Restaurant Critic and the credit card almost make this story bearable. They do not, however, make for a fitting conclusion to the Hitchhiker's trilogy.	2002-07-31

But not everybody has heard it told like this.<br />I love Jon Scieszka's \\"The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs.\\"<br />This version is from the wolf's side of the story. And Mr. Wolf is a deliciously suspicious (if not untrustworthy) narrator. In correcting the story that we, the public, have blindly swallowed whole, Mr. Wolf has hopefully vindicated himself while doing us all a great service. This whole charade was the fault of the dull-witted, untrusting pigs.<br />\\"The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs\\" is a powerful parable about what it means to be a good or bad neighbor. If the tragedy of this story teaches us nothing else, it is at least hilariously entertaining.<br />I give this book my full recommendation.	2002-07-30

By discussing the tender, pursuing love of Jesus, as well as the fierce mercy of our Abba, Manning seeks to point the way to how we should live as God's people in the twenty-first century.<br />Manning begins by giving the lie to the all too common, overly optimistic self-evaluation modern Christians have been giving themselves. In an era where many live by legalism instead of grace and love, it has become too easy to skew the holy \\"stat sheet\\" by moving the goal posts into a more favorable position.<br />Manning's main argument is that the Church at large has become so self-involved and inward, that we squabble while the world around us spiritually starves to death:<br />\\"When the primacy of love is subordinated to doctrinal correctness and orthodox exegesis, cool cordiality and polite indifference masquerade as love among theologians, biblical scholars, and faculties across the land. When absolute control and rigid obedience pose as love within the family and the local faith-community, we produce trained cowards rather than Christian persons.\\"<br />What Manning suggests as solution to the horrid state of things is a return to Christians living as a people of tenderness. The example and presence of Jesus and his loving Abba are to be a model and motivation for believers:<br />\\"Because of the mysterious substitution of Christ for the Christian, each encounter with a brother or sister is a real encounter with the risen Lord, an opportunity to respond creatively to the gospel and mature in the wisdom of tenderness.\\"<br />As usual, Manning's writing is top notch. He is a very talented author. More importantly, Brennan has fearlessly laid bare his soul in parts of this book. Others will no doubt find great healing and motivation in this book as a result. I know I did.<br />I give \\"The Wisdom of Tenderness\\" my highest recommendation.thers will no doubt find great healing and motivation in this book as a result.

Before reviewing it, I'd like to just say thanks. The Message has added a dimension to my spiritual life.<br />Having started the study of Biblical Greek myself about two-thirds of the way through Peterson's labor of love, I now have at least a partially complete picture of the joys and difficulties (or should I say impossibilities?) Mr. Peterson must have faced along the way. It has amazed me to see how much of the seething, vibrant, life that is so often removed from the New Testament in more formal and \\"stately\\" translations is brought by Peterson into powerful, everyday English--or as Peterson says--\\"American.\\"<br />There are some places where I fear certain sections have lost theological nuances (James' letter being a prime example) but one cannot argue that Peterson does, in the end, faithfully and creatively present \\"The Message\\" of the Living God.<br />The Old Testament, which I am familiar with only in English, sings compared to other translations. Some high points for me in Peterson's Old Testament translations are: Job, 1 &amp; 2 Kings, and Isaiah, (possibly my favorite of all of Peterson's translations: chapter twelve's ending especially gets me: \\"Raise the roof! Sing your hearts out, oh Zion!  The Greatest lives among you: The Holy of Israel.\\")<br />Believer or not, \\"The Message\\" will wake you up. It does not do this at the expense of the gospel. It does so by giving worn-out language new wings. Just as the writers of the original books were used by God to communicate His message to a hungry, thirsty and longing world, Peterson has allowed himself to be used to speak to the world of today.<br />I give \\"The Message\\" my highest recommendation.

Before I answer the question of this review's title, let me ask another, possibly more pressing question:<br />Who is this Robert Funk and what has he been up to?<br />Funk was, once upon a time, one of the world's premier scholars in Biblical Greek. That was before he started fiddling with dubious fourth and fifth century Gnostic texts. Ever since, Mr. Funk has been trying to fit the square peg of his interpretation of these jumbled texts into a round hole of some kind of faux-existentialist/anti-supernaturalist &quot;theology.&quot;<br />Hence the book before us. Mr. Funk and his pals at the Jesus Seminar have played with some beads and called it scholarship. The pseudo-science of hypothetical textual criticism has always amused me as being a rather far-fetched area in which to strike up a career. How much more comically absurd then is this &quot;annotated text.&quot;<br />One gets the sense while reading this color-coded &quot;Bible&quot; that the deck was stacked (or at least the jar was filled) well in advance of any trully critical analysis of the texts in question.<br />Therefore, the answer to the question of my title is also a pretty good answer to my second question as well.<br />I cannot recommend this book as anything more than an unintentional humorous parody of scholarship.	2002-07-17

Here it is pretty much straight-up attraction of the \\"hey, I'd like to marry you\\" variety.<br />As the noble, well-meaning but unable to restrain themselves philosopher's fall for the beauties of this tale, many awkward situations occur. Much of the humor here is of this vein. Plays on words and outrageous situations provide most of the laughs.<br />For fans of Shakespeare, I wholeheartedly endorse this great play.

What a vast horizon opened up to me when I picked up this book! Rarely have I encountered a poet that so palpably evokes longing. Few other poets have Neruda's ability to weave images. These poems burrow into the heart.<br />My Spanish is not what it should be, but I was able to read most of the poetry here in the original. For those who know no Spanish, do not be deterred. This volume is the work of not just one but two masterful poets. Merwin's translations are amazing and wholly recommendable. Striking images and a yearning spirit fill the English translations as well as Neruda's originals.<br />I was also caught off guard by poem XVI. I was reading along, thinking how I had not read poetry this full of longing and desire since I last read Tagore's \\"Gitanjali\\" ..., when lo and behold, Poem XVI is a Spanish paraphrase of a Tagore poem...small world.<br />Neruda's poems are of filled with a powerful Eros. Yet, to me, they fall a little short in comparison to those of Tagore (whose love is a spiritual longing). However, the comparison is clearly between two giants of the art.<br />I give \\"Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair\\" a strong recommendation.	2002-06-07

This time Eustace and his friend Jill must find and rescue Prince Rillian of Narnia, King Caspian's son.<br />The Silver Chair operates on so many levels. It is an allegory of Man's interaction with and failure to obey God. It is an argument against the Naturalistic worldview. It is a story of journey and friendship. Most importantly, it is a ripping good tale.<br />In \\"The Silver Chair\\" Lewis introduces us to the often mentioned but never explored (until now) northern countries of his Narnian world. The children are guided by Puddleglum--a Marshwiggle (and also my favorite of the Narnian characters in all the books). Puddleglum was based off of Lewis' own rather frank and earthy gardener. He makes for an unforgettable character.<br />The children and Puddleglum are faced with exceedingly hard and dangerous challenges along the way. Fortunately, they are never really alone in their trials.<br />\\"The Silver Chair\\" contains some of the best literary imagery in the whole Narnian series. It also features some of the best dialogue in all the chronicles. One cannot overstate the sense of wonder in this story.

They are filled with often smart, sometimes absurd and slapstick humor. This book contains two of his lesser-known novels--\\"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\\" and \\"The Log, Dark, Tea Time of the Soul.\\" While not quite as nonstop and rapid fire as the Hitchhiker books, they are possibly Adams' greatest work.<br />First of all, these books are unique. Where else in literature do science fiction and humor intersect with topics such as Quantum physics, Norse mythology, and the poetry of Samuel Taylor Coleridge? Adams weaves these elements into stories that entertain, provoke, and even educate.<br />Adams also creates lasting images: a wonderful depiction of the nonsense that so often surrounds academic and professional banquets, a great representation of the pitfalls of furniture moving, the absurdity of airline check-in lines, and a description of a \\"lurking\\" refrigerator that speaks to some universal human interaction with maltreated appliances.<br />These two novels are wonderful pieces of comic literature. They are also something more. Get a copy and experience them yourself.<br />I recommend this book.	2002-05-26

Some letters are from famous historical figures. Others were written by relatively obscure sources. Some of the letters are very restrained.

These quotes show the breadth and surprising depth of Kennedy's reading and thoughts.<br />I found myself moved by much of the material here. Even the quotes by Sartre (whose works I have been unable to slog through) were of great insight.<br />This is probably the highest recommendation a book like this is ever going to get out of me. I wholeheartedly encourage you to get a copy of \\"Make Gentle the Life of This World.\\"	2002-05-22

Yet, this must be a misprint. Latest? Certainly. Greatest? Hardly.<br />For one thing, anyone with any familiarity with Shakespeare's plays must immediately note the protagonist's lack of humanity. Coriolanus' heartlessness is his chief characteristic. All the things that make him so compelling on the battlefield only serve to dull his appeal as a civilian. Since Coriolanus spends the majority of the play as a civilian, this is bad news for the audience.<br />There may well be tragic events in Coriolanus. However, Coriolanus falls short of great Shakespearean tragedy. The lead is not exceptional (as are the rest of Shakespeare's tragic heroes). At best, Coriolanus is a dolt who becomes a savant on the battlefield. Shakespeare telegraphs, rather than foreshadows, the tragic events of Coriolanus. This, compounded with Coriolanus' inability to carry the play, makes for a rather frenzied mush of a drama.<br />I recommend Coriolanus only to the Shakespearean completist. It is not one of his better works.	2002-05-22

The intricacy of its plot has rarely been matched. Its characters are unforgettable. It speaks powerfully to what it means to be human.<br />Pip is the perfect picture of flawed humanity. He is essentially well meaning, but his vision always seems to get cloudy at just the wrong time. Throughout the book, Pip falls prey to his dreams and infatuations. In the process he ignores those who truly love him. Only in the end does he learn, in catastrophic terms, the importance of love. Only then is able to accept it.<br />\\"Great Expectations\\" is the story of Pip's learning process. Along the way we encounter some of Dickens greatest secondary characters: the fierce Mr. Jaggers, the self-centered and mentally unstable Mrs. Havisham and her heartless prodigy Estella, and Pip's great friend Joe.<br />I give a special recommendation to this Bantam Classic edition of the work. Its introduction by John Irving is one of the greatest pieces of criticism ever written. <br />Though not my favorite Dickens novel, I give \\"Great Expectations\\" a heartfelt recommendation.	2002-05-17

I think that \\"Wizard and Glass\\" is possibly the best book he has written so far. I am always evangelizing others on the greatness of King's massive uber-story. Yet book one, \\"The Gunslinger,\\" seems to be one heck of a stumbling block for most folks.<br />This is understandable. The story begins with Roland (the main protagonist of the series) in his darkest place. He has become hardened, unable to love. The story ends with him making the most heartless of decisions. \\"The Gunslinger puts the capital \\"G\\" in Grim.<br />Yet this almost unbearably bleak backdrop is essential to what the story of Roland and the Dark Tower becomes. In it we learn of what Roland is--a \\"Gunslinger\\"--and how he became one. We learn of the treachery that has set the course of Roland's destiny in motion.<br />Most of \\"The Gunslinger\\" comes off like a flashback wrapped inside a horrible hallucination. Bad things happen and there is no fulfilling end to this part of the tale. It understandably turns a lot of folks off to going any further with The Dark Tower.<br />I am here to tell you to keep on pressing on. King's story is, in my opinion, turning into one of the most epic and worthwhile tales ever written. The dryness of the Gunslinger is more than compensated for in the following books.	2002-05-17

Lewis's \\"Till We Have Faces\\" also did me the service of giving me a good slap across my metaphorical face. How wrapped up we all become in our own little lives. How one-sided and self-favoring is our vision.<br />Though a book about many things--holiness, love, and philosophy to name a few--\\"Till We Have Faces\\" is mainly about how our perceptions can fail us. How in the name of doing what we think is right, we can do horrible things.<br />Orual, the protagonist of the story, spends an entire life learning what the apostle Paul meant when he said \\"Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\\" The real twist in \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is that the reader, more likely than not, learns the same lesson (I know I did).<br />C.S. Lewis is one of my favorite authors for many reasons. This book is definitely one of them. Lewis considered \\"Till We Have Faces\\" to be his best book. I do not know if I agree, but it is certainly a great story.<br />I give \\"Till We Have Faces\\" a very high recommendation.	2002-05-09

Lewis, George MacDonald, and J.R.R. Tolkien being the other three. There is perhaps no better introduction to the works of this remarkable man than \\"Descent Into Hell.\\"<br />Williams did not write \\"easy\\" books. His work is full of obscure allusion and even more obscure vocabulary. His prose is possibly even worse than that of MacDonald. \\"War and Peace\\" probably reads more quickly than a 200 page novel by Williams.<br />Bearing all this in mind, there are probably a million better authors than Williams on his best day. Where Williams stands out is in his thought. I doubt there have even been a handful of authors who have ever expressed an idea over the whole course of a novel as well as Charles Williams did.<br />\\"Descent Into Hell\\" showcases two pillars of Williams' thought: Co-inherence and Substitutionary Love. To simplify, these terms respectively mean (or suggest) that humanity is fundamentally, mysteriously linked and that it is possible to literally bear the greatest burdens of another.<br />\\"Descent Into Hell\\" is also about the pitfalls of being self-absorbed. Williams shows what a great danger this self-centeredness can be on both the physical and spiritual level.<br />Charles Williams is a truly eye-opening author. All that I have read of his work has changed me in some way. I give \\"Descent Into Hell\\" a strong recommendation.	2002-05-09
1563541:US	50593376	R2W24TV76K2OYS	0140481389	907196342	The Crucible (Penguin Plays)	Books	4	4	7	N	N	a prototypical American: John Proctor	Few Twentieth Century American authors were as acquainted with personal pain and tragedy as Arthur Miller. Miller, a brilliant yet flawed man, experienced personal tragedy in his tempestuous marriage to and relationship with Marilyn Monroe. He watched as many of his friends suffered the wrath of the government during the McCarthy era. Miller distilled his own experiences into one of the most memorable tragic figures in American Literature: John Proctor.<br /><br />John Proctor is the protagonist of Miller's play, The Crucible. Set during the Salem witch trials, The Crucible is an extended meditation of the destruction that occurs when people falsely accuse others.<br /><br />Proctor is no hero. He is a man who is deeply respected by his fellow townsfolk. When accusations of witchcraft start flying around Salem, Proctor is urged to declare that the chief \\"confessor,\\" Abigail, is a fraud. The only problem is that Proctor had once had an affair with Abigail. His concern for his good name causes him to hold his tongue.<br /><br />The plot begins to broil when Proctor's own wife is accused of being a witch. She is then arrested. Proctor accuses Abigail of having accused his wife out of jealousy. Yet Proctor's plan to expose Abigail fails when his wife lies to try and protect his name. Proctor himself is accused of being a witch and is arrested.<br /><br />One of the ministers involved in the trials becomes doubtful of the whole situation. He tries to convince the accused of making confessions rather than face death. He persuades Proctor's wife to ask Proctor to confess. Proctor finally surrenders his personal pride and agrees to make a false confession about having been a witch. Yet when he makes his confession, the court tells him that he must name others. Proctor refuses and as a consequence, is sent to the gallows.<br /><br />One gets the sense that Miller saw a lot of Proctor in himself. Miller, though not righteous, was willing to publicly decry the with trials of his own time. The Crucible had a considerably shorter theatrical run than Miller's earlier works. During the virulently anti-Communist fifties, Miller was putting his career on the line by writing The Crucible. While not on the same scale as Proctor's sacrifice, Miller's dilemma was great. Notwithstanding its contemporary importance, Miller's play, and the character of Proctor in general, speak more broadly to the ideas of America and the America tragic hero than they do the issues of their respective periods.<br /><br />America is a land born of cooperation. The States had to unite in order to throw off the British Imperial yoke. Yet America has also always been a land that holds the notion of rugged individualism dear. Though Jefferson gave it clear expression, rugged individualism had been a characteristic of America since its earliest colonial days. These two elements (cooperation and individualism) have combined to form a conflicted national identity.<br /><br />This same conflict occurs within Proctor. Proctor is an individual and proud of it. Nothing means more to him than the picture of personal honor he presents to others. The great irony of Miller's play is that Proctor measures his individual worth by what others think of him. It is this concern for the community that twice is his undoing.<br /><br />The first time Proctor is undone it is in a negative way.  His concern for his good name with the community leads him to not expose Abigail as a fraud. He is rendered silent by his fear of exposure as an adulterer. Abigail's power and influence grow in the meantime. This eventually leads to the arrest of both Proctor and his wife.<br /><br />The second time Proctor is undone is depicted more positively. He refuses to falsely accuse others of witchcraft. This means certain death for the individual (Proctor) and uncertain good for the community (Salem). Proctor's ultimate choice is that the good of the many is superior to the concerns of the individual. Yet thecommunity is malignant. It is the source of many of Proctor's woes. Perhaps this is the main point of Miller's play: the true tragedy in America is the country's unfulfilled dream of individual independence. Whenever dangers threaten the land, be they real or imagined, the individual suffers in the name of the common good.<br /><br />John Proctor is a hero in as far as he is representative of all Americans. Whatever the ideological persuasion of the reader or audience member, something about Proctor's plight speaks to the American experience.<br />The Crucible is a great play. I recommend it.community is malignant. It is the source of many of Proctor's woes.

I regret that I must be the person to do it.<br />By no means is \\"Health, Money, and Love\\" a poor piece of writing. In fact, it is thoroughly entertaining. Yet, if Capon is not beating a dead horse here--the subject of Grace can never be dead no matter how woefully dealt with--then he is certainly abusing a tired one.<br />Don't get me wrong. One can never hear enough about God's immeasurable grace. It is just that Capon keeps recasting it in the same old tired metaphorical terms. This stuff was fresh back when he wrote \\"Between Noon and Three.\\" Now it is just the same warmed-over hash.<br />Instead of an affair between a teacher and a student, we get an affair between a King and a servant-girl. Only this time, Capon's narrative voice is less endearingly wild and a little too defensive. This book lacks the boldness of \\"Between Noon and Three.\\" It comes off a little tired and even a little less certain.<br />I usually don't like comparing different works by the same author. I find it leads to too much personal preference and too little interaction with the text. But these two books are almost identical twins; and one clearly got the weaker genes.<br />I cannot recommend \\"Health, Money, and Love: and Why We Don't Enjoy Them.\\" Capon has done a lot better with the same material in a different book. Get \\"Between Noon and Three\\" instead.	2002-04-24

In its unique examination of life, there are many lessons to be learned.<br />Irving's title character is forced to deal with these issues. In this way, Garp is somehow universal. We all go through trials of one kind or another. Even if we disagree with Garp's decisions, we can understand the struggle that living often is. Garp's life is no picnic. But it rarely ever is.<br />The World According to Garp is the capstone to Irving's three previous novels (Setting Free the Bears, The Water Method Man, and The 158 Pound Marriage). All the themes in Garp can be found (to a degree) scattered through the three earlier stories. The big leap from the first three books to the fourth one is in Irving's plot twisting ability. Garp is nothing if not well twisted.<br />The character of Garp comes into the world in bizarre circumstances. From there, his life only becomes stranger and stranger. Lust, the thing his mother most misunderstands, dictates much in his life. Misinterpretation (by Garp and those around him) also greatly influences Garp's path. Irving acknowledges that life is rarely black and white. Those characters who come to see it as such do so with their heads in the metaphorical sand. Perhaps this is what most enrages the more rabid critics of this book.<br />The more of Irving's books I read, the more I have come to believe that Irving is the greatest living American author. Though I often disagree with what he writes (he seems to offend people of all ideologies), his skill as an author and storyteller is undeniable. I would put him neck and neck with A.S. Byatt as the greatest living author period.<br />The most disturbing thing to me about Irving's writing is the vulgarity. I would argue that he puts it in enough context as to not truly be vulgar. Still, his works are explicit in the extreme. Garp is a whopping example of the phenomenon. Irving does indeed use a lot of stuff some would consider shocking or vulgar, but he does so to illuminate what is wrong with such things.<br />Bearing all of this in mind, I feel that The World According to Garp is an American masterpiece--sometimes disturbing, more often humorous and insightful. I therefore give The World According to Garp a very high but qualified recommendation.Garp is a whopping example of the phenomenon.

Each one has its flaws. Each one hopefully casts new light on God's message to us (translation is inherently interpretation). So it is with The New Revised Standard Version. There are both flaws and moments of revelation.<br />The Bible is full of stories about humanity's interaction with the Divine. As a whole, it is the story of God's redemption of humanity through the death of his Son: Jesus Christ. The NRSV is a rather literal translation (from the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek) of these stories.<br />The greatest weakness of this particular translation is its needless neutering of the Hebrew and Greek generic male pronouns. This cause difficulties (especially with the Psalms) when translating \\"he.\\" They often pluralize such cases to \\"Those\\" and \\"They.\\" This causes passages to lose personal immediacy and force.<br />That said, I feel the NRSV is a fine overall translation. It ranks right up there with The New American Standard Bible as the best literal translations. The NRSV has the extra benefit of having been overseen by Bruce Metzger--one of the finest modern Bible scholars.<br />The greatest strength (and probably the main selling point) of this edition of the NRSV is its extensive Apocrypha. Books recognized by Roman Catholic, Greek, and Slavonic churches are all included. They are placed in between the Old and New Testaments. They are divided into four sections based on who accepts them.<br />The Hardcover edition that I own (from Oxford Press) is extremely well made. It is far more durable than most other hardcover Bibles I have used.<br />If you are looking for a good literal translation of the Bible, you would be well served by The New Revised Standard Version. I highly recommend this book.	2002-04-13

All too often, historians dealing with religion bring along a few spare axes to grind when writing their texts. I was happily surprised by Bruce Shelley's \\"Church History in Plain Language.\\" It is a clear, reader-friendly overview of the history of Christianity.<br />Shelley is as fair as can be expected. He approaches history as neutrally as possible while still acknowledging his Protestant background. Instead of trying to fit history into a doctrinal box, Shelley presents facts. Shelley focuses on the key events and personalities that shaped the history of Christianity.<br />The most appealing thing about \\"Church History in Plain Language\\" is its readability. The author's narrative goes a long way in making what could be dry and boring into an engaging story. In some cases, Shelley has made me feel closer to some of his subjects (Augustine, Gregory the Great, and Calvin) in just a few pages than other authors have with whole books.<br />I highly recommend Bruce Shelley's \\"Church History in Plain Language.\\" It is probably the best one volume introduction to the history of Christianity available.	2002-04-09

It is also so much more. What the reader will find here, besides the recipes, are reflections on life and reality. The theme of Ferial cooking is transferred to a kind of manifesto on Ferial living. Capon sees food, and life as well, through a lens of wonder.<br />Capon's book is really a recipe for living life more fully.

How he unravels the story of his own life, how he makes the past breathe, gives it life...it has all combined to deepen my esteem for him. He is one of the greatest living authors.<br />Buechner's honest search for something universal in his story has captivated me. We all stand, in one way or another, in the shadows of our own lives. Alone, we cannot even comprehend the whole of our own journeys. The value of Buechner's excavation of his past is that when others view it, it may help them see the importance of their own journey.<br />In spite of the author's uncertainness about writing them, I have found Buechner's autobiographies to be of great value.

Still, what is the meaning of the word \\"saint\\" in the present day? While the saints surely still serve as guides to a few, they have taken on an air of incomprehensibility for many others. Even most Christians have a hard time with what the term \\"saint\\" means.<br />All too often when we speak of saints in modern times, images of the self-hating joyless ascetic spring to mind. The only problem is that most of the people we call saints were the furthest thing from these images.<br />What Phyllis McGinley restores to the image of the saints is their basic humanity. These women and men were no different from you or I. Some were shockingly earthy. Some did indeed live among the clouds.

My wife has always loved bread pudding on Christmas morning. So when I saw this book at the library, I had to check it out. I am very glad I did.<br />\\"New-Fangled, Old-Fashioned Bread Puddings: Sixty Recipes for Delectable Sweet and Savory Puddings, Puffs, Stratas, and Bread Souffl&eacute;s\\" is packed with all kinds of goodies. There is something here for everyone (unless you hate bread for some reason).<br />There are, of course, the sweeter choices. Recipes like Crunchy Apple Bread Pudding, Coconut Rum Custard, and Fudgy Chocolate Hazelnut Bread Pudding will definitely appeal to those with a sweet tooth.<br />For those looking for something a little heartier, selections abound. The Eggplant, Basil, and Parmesan Bread Pudding with Charred Tomato Vinaigrette is a meal in itself. The Welsh Rarebit Single Strata and the Winter Spiced German Steamed Bread Pudding are textbook definitions of comfort food.<br />There are so many great recipes here that I could go on endlessly about them. Yet to do so would be wasting your time. Instead, I encourage you to get this book right now--and start cooking! You will not be disappointed.<br />I recommend \\"New-Fangled, Old-Fashioned Bread Puddings\\" very highly.	2002-03-12

This book is full of consistently great recipes. It is probably the best book I've ever read for finding great ways to use Rosemary.<br />The recipes are listed under the following headings: chocolate, asparagus, chiles, coffee, basil, grapes, strawberries, honey, artichokes, black beans, oysters, rosemary, edible flowers, pine nuts, avocado, libations, and figs. Particularly strong sections are the aforementioned Rosemary, the section on Strawberries and the one on Honey. The best recipes I've tried so far are the easy strawberry empanadas, and the pasta with rosemary cream sauce.<br />The photography is outstnding and (surprisingly) rather tasteful. My quibble is with the all too campy final section of the book. We are definately dealing with the \\"eros\\" form of love here (which is quite dangerous without knowledge of \\"agape\\" love).<br />All in all, \\"Intercourses\\" is a very solid cookbook. Despite the flashes of camp, it is very nicely put together--and it features a ton of good recipes. I recommend it.	2002-03-07

Rich Mullins once wrote \\"there's so much beauty around us for just two eyes to see.\\" And so it is with the poetry of this ancient Greek lady Sappho. Without her extra eyes, I would be robbed of some sights I could not have found without her. For instance, in one of her poems, she writes:<br />\\"Awed by her splendor<br />Stars near the lovely<br />moon cover their own<br />bright faces<br />  when she<br />is roundest and lights<br />earth with her silver\\"<br />Not only is there beauty. There is a straightforwardness and frankness to the poems of Sappho. It is a clear distillation of the poet's vision confronts the readers of these pages.<br />There is also wisdom and humor. As when she writes:<br />\\"Experience shows us<br />Wealth unchaperoned<br />by Virtue is never<br />an innocuous neighbor\\"<br />Mary Barnard is to be praised for these clear, unvarnished translations. Likewise, the introduction is very useful in dispelling so much of the myth that has sprung up around the legacy of this great poet. I recommend this book highly.	2002-03-07

I have had this book for over a year now--in hot weather, cold weather, rain and wind--yet it has held up marvelously well in that time. I've had some bonded leather Bibles that have done much worse than this one.<br />Secondly, I must say that this book automatically scores a full five stars because it is the word of my God. Yet, I have had some ask me why I would want to go through the \\"trouble\\" of learning Greek?<br />My answer is the Bible is wonderfully understandable in its translations. I believe also that most translations are wonderfully reliable (though all translations, intentionally or not, have their own added \\"spin\\").<br />The true joy (for me at least) in reading the original (I know, I know...these too are copies, not the \\"real\\" originals) Greek texts is in getting to know the authors a little better. The translations do not allow you to experience the impeccable grammar of Luke (or Mark's rather poor grammar), the Hebrew-isms of James, the staggering vocabulary of Paul, or the weird way John phrases things. The Greek does.<br />These joys, combined with the fact that these words have life in them, is the reason that I give this book, out of all the books I have reviewed--or ever will review, my highest recommendation.	2002-03-05

It is the sequel to Buechner's first piece of autobiographical literature \\"The Sacred Journey.\\"<br />\\"Now and Then\\" picks up where the prior volume left off--Buechner's entrance into Seminary. It follows his life up until the publication of \\"Godric.\\"<br />Don't be fooled by the slimness of this volume. There are many lessons to be gleaned from Buechner's look back on his life. From the lessons of an extended youth in seminary, to the rigors of representing God in a semi-hostile environment, this is an education crammed into a few pages.<br />Yet the main message of this book is best expressed by Buechner himself. About two-thirds of the way through the book he says:<br />\\"Listen to your life. See it for the fathomless mystery that it is. In the boredom and pain of it no less than in the excitement and gladness: touch, taste, smell your way to the holy and hidden heart of it because in the last analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is grace.\\"<br />Get this book.

That said, I have had a rather difficult time deciding how many stars it really deserves.<br />The author does a very nice job presenting what exactly worldviews are. He comes at his material from a very logic-based western mind-frame. This is not necessarily a bad thing. In its way it is very useful. Chapter nine, in which Nash presents some good arguments for a solid belief in Jesus' physical Incarnation and Resurrection, is so well done that I heartily recommend it to anyone.<br />My quibble with this book is that it is very, very derivative. I don&#8217;t mind people quoting from lots of sources in their work&#8212;heck, Brennan Manning does it all the time and he is my favorite author. The specific problem here is Nash&#8217;s constant reference to a few authors (the most prominent being C.S. Lewis).<br />Bearing all this in mind, I am giving \\"World-Views in Conflict\\" a solid recommendation, but only three stars. The content deserves a four, but the constant over-referencing to certain authors knocks off a point. Nevertheless, if apologetics or worldview thinking is your thing, you could do a lot worse than this useful book from Professor Nash.	2002-02-24

It can happen to you.\\"<br />Wright's \\"It\\" is an unexpected encounter with Jesus Christ. Rarely do we see it coming. Wright makes this clear in the very first chapter of his wonderful book, \\"The Way of the Lord.\\" He cites Saul of Tarsus' journey from Jerusalem to Damascus. It was no intentional pilgrimage. Yet by the time Paul reached the gates of Damascus, he was already embarked on a journey that would see him travel the world in service of his God.<br />And so it is for all who follow Christ. As Wright says: \\"One sort of pilgrimage ends, therefore, and a new sort of pilgrimage begins, with the empty tomb of Jesus.\\" Though we may never travel further than ten miles from home, life in Christ is a pilgrimage. Wright's book illustrates this by comparing different facets of the spiritual journey with different areas Jesus traveled through in his sojourn here.<br />Each chapter Focuses on an individual area/spiritual facet of life. They are meant to be read sequentially, but I have gone back to several chapters since first reading them and each has its own lesson and can validly stand on its own. This makes this book an invaluable companion for anyone seeking to follow Jesus.<br />Life in Christ is a wonderful journey--it is truly life \\"to the full.\\" \\"The Way of the Lord\\" is like a tour book of sorts. I give it my highest recommendation	2002-02-24

It was a gift of immeasurable worth and value. I will no doubt still be reading through these wonderful books for years to come.<br />Having just finished the first volume, \\"Run to the Mountain,\\" I stand in awe of the sheer depth and scope of the life we've each been given. The life presented here, that of Thomas Merton, is remarkable in many ways. \\"Run to the Mountain\\" is the chronicle of the years when he started instructing English in college up to his entry at the Trappist monastery in Gethsemani Kentucky.<br />Beyond the external events of his times (the late thirties and forties) lies the bigger story of Merton's eternal destiny. Not since my own salvation have I encountered a story which so clearly illustrates God's pursuing love and grace. The reader can palpably feel Merton being called by God in these pages.<br />It is quite tempting to imagine what might have become of Merton had he not heeded his call. These pages (and most of his later works) make clear his incredible power as a writer. It is not hard to imagine that he would have become at least as, if not more famous than Jack Kerouac, his fellow student at Columbia. It is one of the great \\"what ifs\\" (and there are several) of Merton's life.<br />It is a great thing to be able to read about Thomas Merton's journey--to see him be changed and opened. It is an even greater privilege to take his thoughts and words with me on my own journey. This is one gift I am trully grateful for.  Get this book.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.	2002-02-21

Lewis' \\"Experiment in Criticism\\" is one of those great books that gives one a new lens with which to view life. This book caused me to do a lot of self-examination and reflection on how I interact not just with literature, but also with culture as a whole.<br />Lewis' point is that there is not a real \\"bad\\" or \\"good\\" literature. The value of what we read is in how we interact with it. Lewis defines how people interact with culture in terms of \\"The Few\\" and \\"The Many.\\"<br />\\"The Few\\" are the literary (in other fields they would be musical, have a palette capable of enjoying the best food, or an eye for art). The literary count reading as valuable, read books more than once, are able to be changed by what they read, and remember and share works or pieces of works with others.<br />\\"The Many\\" are the unliterary. Unliterary people generally don't accuse the literary of reading the wrong books-they wonder why literary people make such a big fuss about books at all. They never read a book twice. Their interaction with a work is not deeply felt. Though they may \\"read a lot\\" they don't \\"set much store by it.\\"<br />Lewis draws some interesting comparisons with other forms of cultural involvement. He compares these two styles of reading with how some people interact with art and music. Just because one is in the literary \\"Few\\" does not mean that they are part of the \\"Few\\" in other venues.<br />Chapter five, \\"On Myth,\\" is incredibly valuable in discussing myth as well as the value of modern genres such as Fantasy and Science Fiction. It is a wonderful area to start exploring what has come to be termed \\"Mythopoeic literature.\\"<br />Another notable section is chapter seven which is a discussion of realism. Lewis' definition is broader than the usual. Personally, in changing my perception of what \\"realistic\\" fiction is, this chapter probably influenced me more than any other.<br />This is a book capable of changing the reader's view of culture. It is therefore of great value. I give it my heartfelt recommendation.alue. I give it my heartfelt recommendation.	2002-02-13

Lewis has written of encountering a sense of the holy while reading the works of George MacDonald. I agree with Lewis' assessment when it comes to \\"The Princess and the Goblin.\\" Anyone who reads this book with profit by having done so.<br />First, and perhaps most importantly \\"The Princess and the Goblin\\" is a delightful story. There is a lot of the \\"just plain fun reading\\" stuff going on in this story. There is also a lot more.<br />MacDonald has buried a lot of treasures within the cave walls of his story. If the reader looks carefully as they follow the fates of Irene and Curdie, they will find these jewels just sitting there shining in the darkness, ready to be mined. There are nuggets of wisdom to be gained here in the dialogue, the narration, and in the overall arch of the story.<br />More than this, MacDonald's story features the best of what was Romantic literature and blends it with the greatest characteristics of fairy tales--then he turns convention on its head. Some examples:<br />-Whereas in fairy tales wisdom is associated with the old and knowledgeable, wisdom is here associated with innocence.<br />-While in traditional tales, it is the hero who saves the princess, here the princess must rescue the hero.<br />-Fans of modern fantasy may be used to Providential Guidance being related to male literary figures such as Tolkien's Gandalf, Lewis' Aslan. Here the figure is Feminine--the Grandmother.<br />In the process of playing off of and twisting traditional Romantic literature and fairy tales MacDonald manages to transcend both genres and create a truly original work of wonder.<br />I recommend the \\"Princess and the Goblin\\" most highly. Get it today. Just be careful that you don't pick up an abridgment--they tend to rip out the heart of the tale in an attempt to make the text more modern (neutered).	2002-02-06

Its like watching someone disembowel themselves, draw up a schematic of what they should \\"really\\" look like, and then try, like Humpty Dumpty, to put themselves back together again.<br />Yet, somewhere here Anne Sexton reaches for something a little further from (and at the same time closer to) herself...namely, God. And that is what these poems are: Sexton wrestling with her God. A brief taste of what this text is like (from \\"The Sickness Unto Death\\" which is one of my favorite poems contained in the book)--<br />\\"I who was a house full of bowel movement,<br />I who was a defaced altar,<br />I who wanted to crawl toward God<br />could not move nor eat bread.<br />So I ate myself,<br />bite by bite,<br />and the tears washed me,<br />wave after cowardly wave,<br />swallowing canker after canker<br />and Jesus stood over me looking down<br />and He laughed to find me gone,<br />and put His mouth to mine<br />and gave me His air.\\"<br />There is much to meditate on within the pages of \\"The Awful Rowing Toward God.\\"  When it comes to matters such as spiritual suffering, seeking, and pain, Mrs. Sexton seems to have had some experience. No doubt, this will not be everyone's cup of tea. Nevertheless, there is much of value here.<br />That is why I recommend this book.	2002-01-29

From baskets to cupboards to cloth, Mrs. Ulrich looks at the stories behind each piece and the implications of &quot;homespun&quot; (homemade, useful items) on the larger picture of history.<br />I am impressed by the keen and loving eye Mrs. Ulrich brings to her work. The background information on each type of these items must be vast, but Mrs. Ulrich seems to have an easy fluency in all of them. She combines this knowledge with a passion for history and a flair for storytelling. What results is a wonderful book.<br />The effect of struggle on craft-making and the effect of craft-making on conflict within history casts light on a little observed part of our history. Likewise, it gives us much to ponder about the future.<br />I give &quot;The Age of Homespun&quot; a hearty recommendation.	2002-01-16

I really, really liked the book. I would cite it as one of the best pieces of evidence against those more snobbish folks who like to pretend Stephen King can't write.<br />The book is a masterpiece of intertwining stories. It follows the fates of various characters from a small New England town over the course of more than forty years: from the wonder and sadness of youth, through an eerily terrible account of college, to the identity crises of middle age--and finally, death. Some of these stories will, like Myth, become a part of you.<br />King's honesty and insight into human nature carves a path through the hidden chambers of the human soul. This is some of his greatest stuff.<br />The movie failed to do this book any kind of justice--even with the great Anthony Hopkins.<br />Not so with the tape recording.<br />William Hurt took some adjusting to for me, but he is consistently outstanding as a reader. In &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats,&quot; Hurt captures Bobby's innocence and Mrs. Garfield's ambition (and later wounded-ness) perfectly. His laid back reading catches something of a seemingly simpler time.<br />King also does a darn good job. I did not care for his earlier reading of &quot;The Gunslinger,&quot; but he is spot on here.<br />I highly recommend this audio version.	2002-01-15

Also, we're talking two thousand years of history--there is bound to be some selectivity going on. I feel Mr. Walton does a darn good job here.<br />Let's face it, Charts do not make for riveting reading.

Having given my life to Christ as an adult, I have some perspective on some of the worldviews Sire discusses (having once subscribed to some of them).<br />Sire does not approach any of these worldviews on their own terms. He is constantly sketching out incomplete pictures of what he discusses, sometimes reverting to straw men and logical fallacies to try and push his weakest points. Particularly grievous is his ad hoc dismissal of Eastern thought on the grounds that it does not fit into a rationalistic western paradigm.<br />More disturbing still is the mocking, often superior tone he takes in his arguments. This is especially tragic because these forms of non-arguments are most often used to delegitimize Christians trying engage in an intellectual exchange.<br />No subject is addressed in its entirety. The chapter on New Age thinking focuses so exclusively on a couple of personalities that it ignores whole systems of New Age thought. The consequences of modern Naturalism are not really addressed (Far too many apologists write against Darwin's thought rather than what is currently taught--Sire is a card-carrying member of this club.) Zen Buddhism is treated almost as an afterthought.<br />A lot of these problems probably come from Sire's over-reliance on secondary source material. Though from time to time he throws in a quote from Hesse's Siddhartha (which is also secondary if you ask me), most of the time he is quoting from like-minded colleagues.<br />While I share Sire's final estimation--that Jesus Christ is Lord and the rest of these things are just fantasy lands, I was severely disappointed with this book. It does not really engage any of the other systems in a fair debate. Sire is playing with a stacked deck.<br />I do not recommend &quot;The Universe Next Door&quot; to any serious student of worldview thinking.	2002-01-15

Ellis Peters' &quot;The Leper of St. Giles&quot; starts off as, and continues to be, more of a pure love story than any of its predecessors. Since it is a Cadfael story, murder and mystery do indeed rear their ugly heads. Once more, Cadfael is called (with the support of his nifty new abbot) to do more than mix herbs.<br />Cadfael's former apprentice Brother Mark has left the nest as the story begins. One of the great joys in this book is to see the continued growth of Mark as a minister. In fact it is Mark, more so than Cadfael, who finds himself in the center of the action in &quot;The Leper of Saint Giles.&quot;<br />This is a story that has a lot to do with the meaning of identity and the impact of deception. The basic plot revolves around a lowly squire who loves a wealthy heiress. The problem is, the heiress' wretched relations are intent on marrying her off for financial gain. From this rather nasty situation springs murder and false accusation. It is the job of Cadfael and Mark to make things right.<br />The more I read of Ellis Peters, the more I admire her work. She had a unique literary voice. So much wisdom is imparted in each story. This is doubly true in &quot;The Leper of St. Giles.&quot; The reader is left questioning the actions of Cadfael and pondering the meaning of Justice.<br />While I am left with many questions and I missed Cadfael's old buddy Hugh, I found this book to be one of the more satisfying Cadfael stories. I highly recommend &quot;The Leper of St. Giles.&quot;	2002-01-15

The more I read of Ellis Peters, the greater my respect for her becomes. I recommend this book highly.	2001-12-16

With his daughter finally out of the nest and with the realization that he spent nine percent of his adjusted gross on Christmas the year before, Luther decides to \\"skip\\" Christmas.<br />For Luther (and his wife Nora) \\"skipping Christmas\\" means: not presents, no tree, no buying gifts, no decorating, no office parties, and on the day after Christmas--a big fat cruise in the Caribbean.<br />Only, Luther and Nora do not find extricating themselves from Christmas as easy as it would seem to be on the surface. The rest of the book tells of their adventures in trying to skip Christmas. And as with all great Christmas stories, the ending is wonderful.<br />I give skipping Christmas my highest recommendation.	2001-11-24

I have no words to describe how wonderful this book is. It is a great book for the Christmas season.<br />&quot;Letters From Father Christmas&quot; is a collection of the Letters that J.R.R. Tolkien's children received from Father Christmas (what they call Santa in England) during the over twenty years between 1920 and 1943.<br />Each letter is reprinted along with their accompanying illustrations. Father Christmas' letters are beautiful in their own right, but I am blown away by his illustrations. Some of this art deserves to be in a museum.<br />The letters each tell a story. The North Polar Bear (Santa's friend and assistant) figures prominently in these tales. Other characters (elves, goblins, the snow man--who is Father Christmas's gardener, and the man in the moon) add depth and humor to these tales from the North.<br />Some of these letters had my daughter rolling with laughter as we read them together. They are quite funny no matter what age you happen to be (the Polar Bear's commentaries had me laughing).<br />This is a great book. Readers cannot fail to be moved by these letters and stories. I give &quot;Letters From Father Christmas&quot; my highest recommendation.	2001-11-24

But the abrupt and rather too serious ending leaves me pondering the greatness that could have been.<br />The story follows the exploits of the tittle character as he sets off one morning to find something to eat. He has a hankering for children from the nearby village. He broadcasts his desire to the other creatures of the jungle as he passes them.<br />The only problem is that besides being greedy and ill-intentioned, the crocodile is also nasty to his fellow wild creatures. This comes back to haunt him.<br />The story is a masterpiece of dry humor. Its verbal pacing is darn near flawless. The illustrations are great. Several (especially of the Crocodile's disguises) made me laugh.<br />Outside of the ending, I highly recommend &quot;The Enormous Crocodile.&quot;	2001-11-23

There is no other book I have so longed to recommend to others, but I have felt (and still feel) totally inadequate when it comes to expressing what a wonderful story this is. I could go on for days about all the wonderful things contained here. That said, I will try and focus on only a few aspects of this book and then plead with you to read it.<br />First, I must note that I feel this story should be read in the context of the entire Narnian series. It stands on its own nicely enough, but the deep background of the previous tales adds richness and texture to the tale.<br />Secondly, I must note that this book is highly enjoyable because it works on two levels. The tale as a whole is the story of a journey into unknown lands. With each new place they visit, the whole is broken into wonderful episodes. My favorite episode (with the exception of the ending) is the island where dreams come true...its not what one would expect.<br />The character of Eustace is my favorite of all the humans in the Narnian books. This story is partly a tale of his transformation. This seems to be a universal human desire; but Eustace, like all who truly seek transformation must, finds impossible to reform himself. This is an especially timely lesson for our &quot;self-help&quot; culture at the beginning of the twenty-first century.<br />This brings me to what I like best of &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.&quot; Let me preface what I say here by making it clear that no one hates heavy-handed use of allegory as much as I do. However, the allegory that is &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; is one of the greatest things of beauty I have ever encountered.<br />In one form or another we are all questing after an unseen kingdom. Be it the kingdom of God, Materialism, or simply of the Self--we are all, like Caspian and his pals, on a quest.  I don't wish to give away any endings, but let me just say that the greatest truth Lewis expresses in his book is that no one can reach the True Kingdom on their own.<br />I urge you to read this book. If I could only have a handful of books, this one would definitely be among them. I give &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; my highest recommendation.ay that the greatest truth Lewis expresses in his book is that no one can reach the True Kingdom on their own. <br />I urge you to read this book.

He is a sensitive, honest, and caring author. His other books (with the exception of \\"A Leg to Stand On\\") are all reports of his interactions with people exceptional neurological conditions. In \\"Uncle Tungsten,\\" Dr. Sacks writes about his own past.<br />Sacks is a truly gifted writer. Some of his pieces in the past have stunned me with their beauty. That said, he has never created a fuller, more compelling portrait than the depiction he gives of his mother here. What a special woman she must have been. He clearly loves her still. This book is as much of a love story as it is a history.<br />Sack's recollections are laced through with his early encounters with science in its many forms. He speaks lovingly of his interactions with Chemistry. The education his mother provided him in anatomy also looms large in the images of his early years.<br />While I have always been a fan of Sacks because of his insights into the human condition, I can see the special appeal this book would have to those who have a love for science (my wife loves biology). Sacks writes of it with passion and awe. It was interesting for me, and I've never been much of a fan of science.<br />I recommend this book.	2001-11-02

Perhaps a bit of Buechner's comedic wit? I believe so.&quot;<br />Now, with that said, I'll just come out and say what I feel--&quot;The Water-Method Man&quot; is an often grotesque, but consistently hilarious book. Rarely do I laugh audibly while reading a novel. I did so a lot while reading &quot;The Water-Method Man.&quot;<br />In &quot;The Water-Method Man&quot; (his second novel) Irving made a gigantic leap in plot complexity from his first novel, &quot;Setting Free the Bears&quot; (also a favorite of mine). &quot;Bears&quot; had largely a tripartite soul as far as its plot went--nice and neat. &quot;The Water-Method Man&quot; is a masterpiece of nonlinear, multi-plotline story telling.<br />Again, more than anything, this book is FUNNY (yep...all caps funny). Even the chapter headings are humorous. A few examples: &quot;Prelude to the Last Stand&quot;; &quot;One Long Mother of a Day&quot;; Slouching Towards Overturf&quot; &quot;Another Dante, A Different Hell.&quot;<br />The characters of &quot;The Water-Method Man&quot; really do come to life. Biggie, Couth, Dante, Arnold Mulcahy and Tulpen will all stick in the reader's mind for a long time to come.<br />The Trumper--Thump-Thump--Fred--Bogus character is hard not to like even at his most despicable. This could almost be a parable about the kind of trouble we humans seem to get into without fail when we have no real help outside of ourselves.<br />The character of Merrill Overturf is sure to strike a cord with anyone who has ever been a little &quot;off&quot; in their formative years. I found him the most humorous of all the characters, almost a Platonic ideal of humor.<br />The subplots of Akthelt and Gunnel (an old low Norse epic poem Trumper is translating throughout most of the book) and the movie Packer makes of Thump-Thump's life (the title of which I will not mention here) are both ingenious literary devices. They also provide consistent comic relief (bottled insanity) from the more toned down comedy.<br />While I cannot endorse the vulgarity of some of this book, I am indeed glad I read it.  It has helped me to see from a perspective (in some cases mind you--other stuff here is just plain bizarre--never been through it) that I once saw the world from. It is always useful to look back.<br />For whatever it is worth, I just thought I'd share my thoughts on the book with you. This is one of the funniest books you'll ever get for your money.

Not so anymore. Wenham's clear, even lively discussion of Leviticus has brought it to life for me.<br />Wenham's commentary does not get bogged down by endlessly discussing--as far too many commentaries on books of the Pentateuch do--theoretical textual issues. Instead, Wenham focuses on what the implications of the text were and are.<br />This book contains one of the most powerful discussions on the meaning of sin that I have ever read. Wenham has cleared up not only the fuzziness I had about not only Leviticus, but about several issues in my life.<br />This commentary is priceless. I recommend it most highly.	2001-10-28

Thoreau said that all men must read Homer in the original. Maybe he is right. I don't know.<br />If Homer is half the poet that Robert Fagles's translation makes him out to be--it will be well worth the effort. In his book \\"How to Read a Poem and Fall in Love with Poetry,\\" Edward Hirsch says that poems are like messages in bottles that make their way unseen across oceans of time and culture to unforeseen readers. When I uncorked this bottle I was blown away by the song it sang.<br />Fagles has impeccable descriptive power, which he blends with stunning imagery and timing. I recommend this book highly...come, be swept along on the heroic tides of this wine-dark sea. Experience the Odyssey the way it was meant to be.	2001-10-05

I found that being a vegetarian (and still basically a normal guy) meant having to deal with some weird stuff when you went to use a vegetarian cookbook.<br />\\"Mollie Katzen's Vegetable Heaven: Over 200 Recipes for Uncommon Soups, Tasty Bites, Side-By-Side Dishes, and Too Many Desserts\\" is a great book for a person like me.<br />I have never been and will never grow to be fond of Tofu (actually, there is one exception to this declaration--but that is for another time and place). Way too many vegetarian cookbooks feature tofu almost to the exclusion of any other kind of an entree. This is discouraging for those of us who HATE tofu.<br />Mollie is a different kind of bird than the \\"tofu-natics.\\" Her books have some recipes featuring tofu (and some of the other items unique to vegetarianism) mind you, but she does not club the aspiring vegetarian chef over the head with it. That is one of the main reason I like her books--I love this one in particular.<br />Another reason I really like this book is that these recipes make you look like you know what you're doing in the kitchen. I made the Mexican Chocolate Cake with Mocha Cream for instance...people raved about it...so much of life is in following the instructions.<br />This book is laid out differently than her earlier books. It has side by side dish options, more extensive menus in the back, and a different kind of artwork. I like her old and new looks about the same. The color is a big plus to this volume, but it is really a matter of apples and oranges.<br />I thank Mollie Katzen from the bottom of my heart for sharing these wonderful recipes. The rest of you should check them out.	2001-10-05

Yet, when I ask myself--&quot;how can I possibly not give some of the stuff here more than five stars?&quot; I cannot sufficiently answer the question.<br />A poet like Frost comes around maybe once in a generation (if we're lucky). Some of his works are undeniably for the ages. This volume is filled with the treasures Frost left to us.<br />Works like &quot;The Tuft of Flowers,&quot; &quot;The Death of the Hired Man,&quot; &quot;Blueberries,&quot; &quot;The Road Not Taken,&quot; &quot;Fire and Ice,&quot; and &quot;Mending Wall&quot; (a poem that literally changed my life) are genuine contributions to world literature.<br />A ton of Frost's poetry is to be found in this edition. I am struck by how consistent and sure he is in his poetry. This man was a great poet. I am not a big fan of reading plays. I'd rather see them interpreted by actors on a stage. I'm not going to lie and say Frost was a great playwright--he was not. But all the same, I am glad to have read the works contained in this volume.<br />I must say that The Library of America's volume are all handsomely done and attractively presented. The texts are extremely readable for only being in ten-point font. For the most point, I ignored the notes (I prefer to make heads or tales of things on my own.) The few that I read surprised me because they actually were enlightening.<br />I recommend this volume most highly.	2001-10-04

While \\"Startide\\" is a great book (Earth is actually my favorite book written by Brin), I do not think that Sundiver is a \\"weaker\\" effort. The two books are apples and oranges. One, \\"Sundiver,\\" is essentially a mystery. The other, \\"Startide Rising,\\" is more of an action-adventure book. I recommend them both. \\"Sundiver\\" really sets the context for \\"Startide\\" nicely.<br />\\"Sundiver\\" is a great mystery that kept me guessing until the end. It is filled with the kind of invention and personal treachery/heroics that make the Uplift series great. Brin has made a visionary world in his two great series.<br />I recommend this book.	2001-10-01

Soul Survivor is possibly his most personal, most effective book yet. Phil Yancey tries to approach life without blinders. Soul Survivor is a wonderful retelling of his journey so far.<br />Yancey does not pull any punches in recounting his past. From being raised in a narrow, racist, legalistic church, to the influences that changed him into the man he now is...it is all told here in Yancey's interesting, engaging manner.<br />I would give my left arm for more honesty in our nonfiction writers. Yancey achieves meaningfulness by confessing his past and present shortcomings in this book. It is a shame that we don't see such openness in more authors. Honesty is probably my favorite thing about Yancey as an writer.<br />I really enjoy Yancey's descriptions of those who have influenced his life. It was great to read about how Yancey's old writing partner Dr. Brand affected his life. I think my favorite part of the book is his profile of Annie Dillard. I have recently started reading Dillard myself, and I am blown away by her.<br />I recommend this book. I encourage you to get a copy today.	2001-09-28

(Modern Library Classics)	Books	4	3	6	N	N	before we knew what it meant to be an American	The Stories of Washington Irving are from a time before America had its national identity figured out. Just as recent times have shown what it means to be American--the terrible cost and awesome responsibilities of freedom, Irving's tales showcase the characters who were exploring the uncharted waters of their new found freedom.<br />I never liked Irving when I read him in school. This can probably be explained by the fact that I have always had a homework allergy. However, I have recently reacquainted myself to the man's writings. I am surprised how much I now enjoy them. It has been a joy to step back in time with Irving. His characters affirm my belief that no matter what age people live in, they are still able to speak to the present.<br />The aspect of Irving's writing that appeals to me most is his humor. It is exemplified by his two most famous tales: &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,&quot; but it is present throughout the work. We humans, much like Dame Van Winkle, tend to be too serious. Irving was an astute chronicler of the people he saw around him--all the while looking at life through smiling eyes--and it is most refreshing to share his view for a while.<br />I recommend this book.	2001-09-21

The Oprahfication of America has too often brought the sexes into warring opposition. So much so that when men or women write about what it means to be men and women, they can't seem to resist taking backhanded swipes at the value of one another. At the time, I did not know that &quot;Gift From the Sea&quot; was so old...I figured it would be the same stuff we see too much of today rehashed in pleasant warm-fuzzy, faux spiritual fashion to fit the market. I stand corrected.<br />Mrs. Lindbergh shows herself to be an author of deep insight, intellectual honesty and true caring. As she reflected on each shell she found on the beach and related them to life not only as a woman (although it is a central theme) but as a human in our modern times (it still fits--even fifty years later), I was swept up into her thoughts and dazzled by her soul.<br />Lindbergh finds much worth in what we are when all the noise of our surroundings is stripped away. She seeks to cling to this essence and bring it to bear as she reenters to tempest of everyday life. I can relate to this.<br />&quot;Gift From the Sea&quot; reminds me forcefully of what David said in the seventeenth Psalm. He cries out to the one who has made him. He asks that God keep him as the apple of his eye--to allow him to seek shelter in shadow of his wings. This is a cry for protection but also for a wholeness we all lack, whatever the age we live in. I believe Morrow Lindbergh's words echo this. David concludes with these words:<br />&quot;And I--in righteousness I will see your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness&quot; (v. 15).<br />May we all! I recommend this book.	2001-09-04

Some of them actually involved writing. All of them, even if combined with the multitude of college classes I've had on the subject, have not taught me or encouraged me as much as Stephen King's &quot;On Writing.&quot; This three part book is a real treat.<br />In the first part King tells of (with great dark humor) the events in his early life that formed him as a writer. From being locked in a closet by a baby sitter, to hearing dreadful tales of a building cleanup from coworkers at a laundry mat, one can see why King writes what he does.<br />The second part of the book is a rather straightforward &quot;how to be a writer&quot; manual. King has some great insights, a raging hatred of adverbs, and entertaining illustrations of the craft to share. I find this part invaluable. Anyone who has read my reviews here on Amazon must have guessed by now how little help all my writing classes gave me. While I will no doubt not be the next Herman Melville or John Irving, I think King has given me some great stuff to work with.<br />The most moving part of the book for me is &quot;On Living.&quot; It is the tale of King's run in with a big blue van and his journey back to the land of the living. I am amazed (and glad) that he survived his injuries. The love between Stephen and Tabitha seems to be something special.<br />I give &quot;On Writing&quot; a big ol' recommendation from my heart. Thanks Steve...and keep on writing.	2001-09-03

Each picture in this book is filled with a sense of life and love.<br />&quot;Fairy Dreams&quot; is essentially a far more beautiful, even lyrical version of the old &quot;Where's Waldo?&quot; books.<br />The fairies leave things lying around in each picture. The job of the reader is to pick them out of the background. Such books do not test the knowledge of the reader, but rather the fullness and keenness of the eye. One must &quot;know&quot; how to see things skillfully.<br />This is all fine and dandy, but I'd recommend losing yourself in the pictures and words before you go searching for the items. This stuff is just plain eye-popping. Spend some time with it and let your imagination run free.<br />I give &quot;Fairy Dreams&quot; a high recommendation.	2001-08-30

I recommend it to anyone.<br />Historically, I have not been much of a reader of mystery writers. The Chronicles of Brother Cadfael have made me a fan of Ellis Peters's writing. She does not write the one-sided characters that too often fill such books. She consistently surprises me with the depth and realistic humanity of her characters. This is seen most clearly in the &quot;villain&quot; of &quot;Monk's Hood.&quot;<br />Peters's vision of medieval Shrewsbury becomes, like Cadfael and fellow monks, more interesting with each book. It is a perfectly conceived (or reconstructed) world in which to act out her tales.<br />I am pleased to see Brother Robert's return to a place of prominence within the storyline. He is the perfect personification of pomposity-a delightful foil for the straightforward Cadfael.<br />I give a heartfelt recommendation to &quot;Monk's Hood&quot; and the whole Cadfael series. Check it out.	2001-08-28

Combined, they make tales that cut to the soul.<br />The beauty of &quot;When the Sun Rose&quot; is heart-rending. A friend who arrives in a golden carriage drawn by a Lion that shines like the sun; this Lion of Surpassing Beauty feeds on blueberries and cream; golden roses leaving something of the friend's presence at the end of day. &quot;When the Sun Rose&quot; is beautiful...a wonderful hymn to imagination and all that lies within as well as beyond us.<br />I recommend this book.

Still, for all its flaws and fixations and its sporadic nastiness...&quot;A Widow for One Year&quot; is an undeniable masterpiece.<br />Irving's fixation on sex rears its head BIG TIME in this book. It gets down right gratuitous. I can understand such fixation at the beginning of the book; after all, the plot is centered on a sixteen year old boy. The thing is that this fixation does not stop--even when the characters are pressing their sixties and seventies.<br />Some parts are just gross.<br />None of the characters even takes a second to reflect on their promiscuities (I am thinking especially of Ruth here...of all the characters, she at least, should have some shred of conscience).<br />Another quibble I have is that things are not simply foreshadowed in &quot;A Widow for One Year&quot;--they are telegraphed in what is the literary equivalent of a screaming boldfaced newspaper headline.<br />Other than those two caveats, I have to say that &quot;A Widow for One Year&quot; is an absorbing story that is skillfully told.<br />The intricate structure of the novel is mind-boggling. I don't think I have ever read a tale with some many narrative devices. Irving has once more proved himself to be one heck of a writer.<br />In spite of its characters messed up psyches, sex lives, and skewed moralities...there is something redeeming about a story that shows to power of one person's true love for another.<br />I must admit that I enjoyed this book.	2001-08-27

It is the first book by her that I've read that has not blown me away. Still, I can see quite clearly how a book like this would move the heart of a dancer.<br />Both my wife and daughter have danced some ballet. So I was not surprised when my daughter really enjoyed this book.<br />This little tale about the relationship between Gemino and Pavelle is quite interesting. Like the rest of Berger's stuff, it is a clear enough story to read once to a child. At the same time, it is deep enough to bear some reflecting on by mature kids and mature adults.<br />I wish I could give &quot;The Jewel Heart&quot; three and a half stars. It is, like all of Berger's books, worth reading. It is just not my personal favorite. That said, I recommend it.	2001-08-24
1864758:US	50593376	RK1VDMT5HXAUG	0439139597	667539744	Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire (Book 4)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	worthy of my highest recommendation	&quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; is my favorite book in the Harry Potter series so far. It is a masterpiece. It is the beginning of what promises to be an epic engagement between the powers of Good and Evil.<br />A lot of people (too many of which have not actually read these books) find the Potter books objectionable. I have to seriously agree that less mature children should not read &quot;The Goblet of Fire&quot; until they can handle some of its darker aspects. Still, I find it no more objectionable than other great children's books such as &quot;The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; or &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;<br />I praise J.K. Rowling for not glamorizing evil. As Lord Voldemort gets stronger in book four, we get to see him for what he is...the personification of evil, with nothing admirable about him.<br />There are some great new characters in book four. My favorites are Ludo Bagman and Viktor Krum (you have to love how he say Herm-o-niny).<br />I have also really come to like Cedric Diggory (who is mentioned briefly in book three). Cedric reminds me a lot of C.S. Lewis's High King Peter--the very picture of true chivalry.<br />As always, another book makes me like Harry, Hermione and Ron (all the Weasleys really--especially &quot;Weatherby&quot;) more than I did in the book before. Though human and flawed, they are great as unlikely heroes.<br />I give &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; my highest recommendation.	2001-08-24

I have to agree with the reviewer of August 7, 2001's enthusiasm for this book. I first read &quot;Answering God: The Psalms As Tools for Prayer&quot; when I checked it out of a local library. The book so moved and changed me that I had to stop midway, turn the book back in at the library, and order a copy.<br />&quot;Answering God&quot; is the kind of book that helps the reader open doors that have always be locked to them. In my case, it has revolutionized the way I pray while giving the Psalms greater meaning to me.<br />It is a small book of great depth. It looks at the Psalms--warts and all. It digs deep into the topics it discusses. It looks at the basic questions of what a Psalm consists of. It then teaches what prayer is and how it affects those who pray. It follows this by teaching the reader how to pray the Psalms.<br />This book is full of practical advice and direction. Eugene Peterson is the perfect person to write this book. He is an expert in the field of prayer...not because of any degree he holds but because he is a deep person of prayer (this will be crystal clear to anyone who reads the book). Peterson is a trusted guide for the sometimes unforgiving terrain of the Psalms.<br />I give &quot;Answering God&quot; my most heartfelt recommendation. I urge you to get a copy today.	2001-08-24

Wright's &quot;The New Testament and the People of God&quot; five stars. Another part is leaning towards three. I'm gonna split the difference and give this monolith of a book four stars.<br />Wright is one of my favorite authors. This does not mean I agree with him all of the time. His critiques of those he disagrees with theologically are masterful. He lays careful foundations for his own work. His methods are generally quite solid. A lot of his conclusions are insightful. However, there are some things about Wright's work that leave me puzzled. For instance, I cannot understand his insistence that Jesus didn't really &quot;know&quot; know that he was the Son of God.<br />This notwithstanding, &quot;The New Testament and the People of God&quot; is an excellent first volume in what will no doubt be Wright's magnum opus: &quot;Christian Origins and the Question of God .&quot; This first volume sees Wright laying out the principles he uses while doing his work, discussing the history of much of the work that was done preceding him, and examining the world Jesus was born into.<br />The length of five hundred pages is deceptive.  &quot;The New Testament and the People of God&quot;is a very dense read. It is heavily (though not too heavily) footnoted. Its ideas take adequate time for reflection to digest. I would even go so far as to suggest that reader either unfamiliar with Wright's work or not used to reading theology or books about the historical Jesus start with one of Wright's more popular books in preparation for reading this series. I would recommend starting with a book such as &quot;The Way of the Lord,&quot; &quot;The Challenge of Jesus,&quot; or &quot;The Crown and the Fire&quot; instead of starting cold on a massive undertaking like &quot;The New Testament and the People of God.&quot; Wright is a great writer. You don't want to turn yourself off to him by jumping into the deep waters before you're ready.<br />I recommend this book highly.book highly.	2001-08-22

Shrewsbury (the home of Cadfael's Abbey) is caught up in the conflict between Empress Maud and King Stephen. The Castle is laid siege to and seized by Stephen. Stephen then executes ninety-four of Maud's supporters in Shrewsbury. Yet, when a count is taken of the bodies, there are ninety-five corpses. Thus the mystery begins--and Cadfael, the monk/herbalist of Shrewsbury springs into action.<br />I cannot make heads or tales of whether I like &quot;One Corpse Too Many&quot; as much or more than the first book in the series (A Morbid Taste For Bones). Both books are quite good. However, with the exception that they are both mysteries featuring Brother Cadfael, they are quite different. This gives me great hope for the rest of the series. The character of Cadfael is developed successfully and Peters avoids being formulaic.<br />I missed some of the characters from &quot;A Morbid Taste For Bones&quot; (particularly the pompous presence of Prior Robert). Yet there are some great new characters in book two. My favorites are &quot;the boy Godric&quot; and the wily and resourceful Hugh Beringar. The dual love stories of &quot;One Corpse Too Many&quot; add another dimension to the book.<br />Cadfael's closing comments (in which the title phrase is used) are well worth the price of the book. All in all, I give &quot;One Corpse Too Many&quot; a heartfelt recommendation.	2001-08-17

They still sell well enough (Kerouac's novels always will and Merton's non-poetry will always have a niche market among Christians), but with the exception of Reznikoff's brief appearance in one of The Library of America's volumes of twentieth century American Poetry, you can't find these guys in an anthology to save your life.<br />I say all this to point out that in his time, Bukowski was a master...In my opinion, &quot;Love is a Dog From Hell&quot; is his best volume of poetry. It is proof that he was a massive talent who, when compared with a lot of the drivel that sells, comes off looking like a veritable Giant (though a quite depraved one). In fact, as a teenager, he was my favorite poet. Yet now that I am a little older, hopefully a little wiser, and from a theological point of view a new creature, I have to say that I am saddened to reflect on how a writer of the immense talent of Bukowski wasted what he was given.<br />All of this aside, Bukowski did not leave me with nothing for having read him. Once, I looked at Bukowski as a master in his field...I used to wish I would someday be able to write as well as he did. In his work he expresses a great deal of forthrightness. This quality, which I picked up from reading Bukowski, was instrumental in my spiritual journey. So thanks in part to the unwitting aid of Bukowski I now have a new master--not merely a poet, but the author of all poets...&quot;And my tongue shall declare His righteousness And His praise all day long&quot; (Psalm 35:28).<br />While the poems contained within this volume can be quite striking and darkly humorous, I must say that reading it is very similar to eating all frosting and no cake. Bukowski doesn't know love from a hole in the ground.<br />In the end, I cannot give &quot;Love is a Dog From Hell&quot; my recommendation. Neither can I give it or its author condemnation...but for the grace of God, there go I.g all frosting and no cake. Bukowski doesn't know love from a hole in the ground.<br />In the end, I cannot give &quot;Love is a Dog From Hell&quot; my recommendation. Neither can I give it or its author condemnation...but for the grace of God, there go I.	2001-08-13

I first read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in Science class when I was twelve years old. Perhaps this explains why I do not like science (or its evil twin sister...math) and why I have never stopped reading. Recently, I have started rereading the trilogy. It is amazing how much seems new to me after all these years.<br />The beginning of the trilogy, &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings,&quot; is an enticing feast to begin with. It picks up years after the ending of Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; The story begins with the coming again of Gandalf to, and the departure of Bilbo from the Shire. It then moves forward into telling about Bilbo's nephew Frodo and the magic ring Bilbo leaves him.<br />As events are set in motion, Frodo flees his peaceful home in the Shire. He and a fellowship of others are commissioned with destroying the magical ring...which they are informed is the most powerful tool of evil ever created...the One Ring. The great problem they face is trying to figure out how they will march straight into the heart of the enemy's power to the only place it can be destroyed.<br />I am amazed at the eloquent power of Tolkien's writing. As a child, I was only concerned by the action of the plot (and there is plenty of action and suspense here). Now that I am a little bit older, I am blown away by the depth of these books. Tolkien's creation--the world of Middle Earth is a masterpiece. These stories are filled with poetry and legends from the past ages of middle earth. This depth makes the tale of the Ring breathe with life and wonder.<br />The characters are even more fascinating than the journeys they go on. Sam, Gandalf, and Aragorn are my favorites so far; although I really like the developing friendship between Gimli and Legolas.<br />I can't wait to read the rest of the stories. I highly recommend &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring.&quot;	2001-08-09

I have greatly enjoyed reading her books. Journey into Narnia is no exception. In fact, I believe she brings the most passion to her work here.<br />The first half of this volume, \\"The Lion of Judah in Never-Never Land\\" is a masterpiece. It is like a theology of Lewis' Narnian tales. Lindskoog is not just another fan of Narnia, she is an insightful scholar. She demonstrates her deep knowledge of Lewis' other work while examining Lewis' views on Creation, Humanity, and God as expressed in the Narnian stories.<br />I must make mention here that one should read Lewis' books at least once all the way through before reading this book...a lot is given away (The conclusion is quoted within the first fifty pages). So don't spoil Narnia for yourself...read the books before you read this.<br />Part two is a book by book look at the stories. It has trivia questions, things to ponder, and benedictions based on each story (I love the one for The Magician's Nephew). The most startling thing I took away from part two is how much Lewis owed and made allusion to E. Nesbit's children's stories within the Narnian books.<br />The Chronicles of Narnia are some of my all-time favorite books. Mrs. Lindskoog has added to my appreciation of them. I recommend this book highly...may the Great Lion be with you.	2001-08-07

She is a visual artist of stunning talent. Her pictures breathe with life and light. Her words are even more captivating. They are clear and precise...flowing like water from a mountain spring.<br />Gwinna is, in my opinion, Berger's masterpiece. At just over a hundred pages, it is a longer work. While Grandfather Twilight, A Lot of Otters, and the Donkey's Dream are great books for children, I would have to recommend Gwinna to children who are a little older or more mature.<br />Gwinna, at its heart, is a story of many things: it is a story about needing others, it is a story about giving, a story of love and faith and being true. It was a difficult story for me. I often suffer from knowing all too well were a plot is going to go before it gets there...to my delight, Gwinna kept me guessing.<br />The highest recommendation I can give, I give to Gwinna. It is a fine thing to read a story where the character grows in wondrous and moving ways within the imagination. The reader (unless they miss the story completely) must grow in turn. Gwinna is such a story...get it today.	2001-08-04

And, it is as a novice that I review this work...<br />There is much to praise in Miller and Grenz' &quot;Introduction to Contemporary Theologies.&quot; It is pretty &quot;bottom shelf&quot;--not much intimidating jargon or assuming too much of the audience. The work is written in a very engaging and accessible manner. The footnotes are of some use while not being imposing.<br />The book also has several weaknesses. It's very brevity forces a great deal of selectivity in what gets discussed. It takes a look at an eclectic assortment of authors. Some are cut and dried theologians...folks like Barth, Bultmann and Pannenberg; others are more popular theologians who wrote for broader audiences...Bonhoeffer being the prime example; others could be described as theologians but also might be considered philosophers or social advocates...Ruether, Gutierrez, and Hick for example.<br />The authors strive for objectivity by presenting the background and argument of each author and then weaknesses others have found in each author's work. Yet sometimes, it seems that the authors spend more time picking apart the work of certain authors than that of others. The two authors who suffer worst at the their hands are Moltmann and Hick. The discussion of Hick actually degenerates into a debate about tolerance and intolerance.<br />All other flaws aside, this introduction is seriously in need of some basic bibliographies of the authors discussed. As it stands, if a reader becomes interested in a particular author, then it is left up them as to where to start reading...no help is given.<br />Each section could also be greatly improved with a discussion of the influence of each author. One who is uninformed in these matters is left with questions. For instance: how did Ruether influence feminism, what is happening with Liberation theology today, and what is the impact of process theology?<br />All in all, I guess I recommend this book because it has the ability to the reader interested in the theologians discussed. It is by no means comprehensive; it has its definite slants...still, I enjoyed it in spite of itself., what is happening with Liberation theology today, and what is the impact of process theology?<br />All in all, I guess I recommend this book because it has the ability to the reader interested in the theologians discussed.

If you like visually beautiful stories, then you'd be hard-pressed to top the work of Barbara Helen Berger. The otters come to life on the pages of this book...frolicking, reading, rolling, and tasting stars.<br />Besides its stunning visuals, &quot;A Lot of Otters&quot; is also filled with haunting, almost singing prose; one example:<br />&quot;A lot of otters saw the stars fall. They dove down into the dark, down into the deep.&quot;<br />Mrs. Berger is one of the best at what she does--she is a true myth-making aritist. It is hard to walk away from one of her stories without being somehow enriched. I recommend &quot;A Lot of Otters&quot; most highly.	2001-07-19

What a great book! Jesus loves us. The funny thing is that we spend all this time trying either please or rebel against God...when all the time God's waiting here, patiently waiting to get a word in edgewise--He's waiting to tell us He loves us--and desperately. James Bryan Smith makes this crystal clear. This is indeed great and good news. God has proved and everyday continues to prove His love.<br />&quot;God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; (Romans 5:8)<br />God loves us as we are...not as we think we should be...I have recommended a lot of books in my time here on Amazon. A lot of them have been rather good.

In these past few days, it has changed mine.<br />Thank you Mr. Smith for this awesome book. I second your prayer (from page 40):<br />&quot;May we have the courage not to run when the voice of our condemning heart would tear us from the place where we can hear the voice of God saying to us, &quot;You are my beloved child, in whom I am well pleased.&quot; Even if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts.&quot;<br />If you're still reading this review and haven't got this book...go get it now.	2001-07-18

Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.''&quot; (Matthew 28:18-20)<br />The late Bob Briner's &quot;Roaring Lambs&quot; is a book that should be necessary reading for any Christian seeking to fulfill the Great Commission in contemporary America.<br />&quot;Roaring Lambs&quot; focuses on our calling to fulfill the Lord's commission; specifically by being salt and light in our culture. Briner firmly but lovingly condemns the &quot;ghetto&quot; that many Christians have created for themselves by withdrawing into their own subculture. He states:<br />&quot;We feel we are making a difference because we are so important to ourselves. We have created a phenomenal subculture with our own media, entertainment, educational system, and political hierarchy so that we have a sense that we're doing a lot. But what we've really done is create a ghetto that is easily dismissed by the rest of society.&quot;<br />Briner sums up the problem this way: &quot;Culturally, we are lambs. Meek, lowly, easily dismissed cuddly creatures that are fun to watch but never a threat to the status quo.&quot;<br />Thankfully, Briner does not argue that we should mindlessly lob grenades at society from within the safety of the ghetto's walls--far too many do that already. Instead, Briner states that we must engage in the discourse of our culture. Christians must involve themselves in the culture shaping arenas of art, entertainment, the media and education. In short:<br />&quot;It is time for the lambs to roar.&quot;<br />The rest of the book is composed of chapters examining each culture shaping field. Briner, who himself worked in the media as a producer, offers practical suggestions for people wishing to make an impact in these areas.<br />Having come to Christ as an adult, I personally was not raised in the ghetto Briner speaks of. Yet...I know a good deal of people who were; as well as a few who still live there. This book is a great wake up call for such people. It is liberating for them and inspiring for all who long to see God's Kingdom flourish.<br />Briner did all Christians a service by writing this book. It is a call to action from within the Church that leads us to go beyond the Church and into a world which is ripe for harvest.<br />I highly recommend &quot;Roaring Lambs.&quot; If you finish reading &quot;Roaring Lambs,&quot; and want more practical advice and insights on positive ways to shape culture, you can find them in Dick Staub's &quot;Too Pagan, Too Christian.&quot; Both are excellent books and work hand in hand together.e wishing to make an impact in these areas.<br />Having come to Christ as an adult, I personally was not raised in the ghetto Briner speaks of.

It seems that among those who have read at least two of Irving's novels, there is usually one that they pick and passionately cling to as their favorite. Most then judge the rest of Irving books as falling short of the glory of their favorite. How unfortunate.<br />&quot;Setting Free the Bears,&quot; when taken by itself, is more than worth reading. However, far too many people seem predisposed to shoot it down without finishing reading it...usually because it's supposedly &quot;not as good as&quot; (insert favorite Irving novel here). People may well be extra harsh on &quot;Setting Free the Bears&quot; because Irving's style is not yet fully formed here (it is something along the lines of Irving plus Jack Kerouac with a dash of Tom Robbins thrown in to boot).<br />All this notwithstanding, I am glad to have read this book; to have encountered characters such as Siggy, Graff, Gallen and the rest of this unique cast. The literary device of splitting up the book with Siggy's notebook is pure genius.<br />One of the reasons I enjoy Irving so much is his great sense of humor. There is plenty of it here (though much of it is of a darker kind than later Irving). In particular, I laughed out loud upon reading the scene where Siggy gets his &quot;shave&quot;.<br />All in all, I give &quot;Setting Free the Bears&quot; a most hearty recommendation. Though it is not perfect by any means (I only know of one such book), it has great moments of beauty and humor. Well worth reading.	2001-07-12

It not only keeps the reader guessing until the end, but it also has passages that reflect a keen insight into human nature. More than that, it well written (a lot of mysteries feel so mass-produced and sketchy). The characters here are well formed and eloquent. All of this is done without the usual gratuitous gore so often found in such books.<br />One of the more interesting subtexts to watch for are the different conceptions of forgiveness that the characters hold; these conceptions largely determine the actions of each one...something to ponder in real life.<br />I recommend &quot;A Morbid Taste for Bones&quot; to all those who enjoy absorbing and well written mysteries. I look forward to the other Chronicles of Brother Cadfael.	2001-07-07

I'd heard a good deal about her prior to reading it. I was prepared to be disappointed. I was not. &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; is one heck of a book.<br />Ms. Norris is a rare find. In &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; she combines deep, honest reflection with beautiful, unassuming prose to construct short, sweet, and insightful pieces about words (things like &quot;grace,&quot; &quot;judgment,&quot; and &quot;hell&quot;) that have always unsettled or scared her a bit. She examines each word carefully. Often, she thought of sides of a topic I had never considered. The following is part of the passage on grace...Ms. Norris approaches the subject in a unique and enlightening way (She is speaking in the context of Jacob's flight from his brother Esau as told in Genesis 28):<br />\\"God does not punish Jacob as he lies sleeping because he can see in him Israel, the foundation of a people. God loves to look at us, and loves it when we will look back at him. Even when we try to run away from our troubles, as Jacob did, God will find us, and bless us, even when we feel most alone, unsure if we'll survive the night. God will find a way to let us know that he is with us in this place, wherever we are, however far we think we've run. And maybe that's one reason we worship-to respond to grace. We praise God not to celebrate our own faith but to give thanks for the faith God has in us. To let ourselves look at God, and let God look back at us. And to laugh, and sing, and be delighted because God has called us his own.&quot;<br />Kathleen Norris is to be commended for the courage she displays in pondering the questions these often loaded words have left her with. All who read her book will benefit from her thoughts.<br />&quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was a true joy to read. I recommend it highly.	2001-06-29

Yes, sweeter than honey to my mouth!&quot; (Psalm 119:103) When most folks think about Hersheys and Mars they no doubt think chocolates and sweets. Joel Glenn Brenner's book: &quot;The Emperors of Chocolate : Inside the Secret World of Hershey and Mars&quot; demonstrates that they are so much more than chocolate companies.<br />This is an extremely readable, entertaining book. The histories of these two companies are fascinating...from the utopian dream of Hershey's early days to the cloak and dagger intrigues during the Gulf War...this stuff is fascinating.<br />Brenner's look into how Mars functions as a veritable family run empire was particularly thought provoking to me. I found the reasoning behind the Mars company's dislike for Peanut Butter very humorous (basically-the brothers don't like Peanut Butter-so they don't like selling it).<br />The reality of these companies makes Dahl's legend: &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; look dull in comparison. The layout of the book and the photos add wonderful atmosphere to the story.<br />I recommend this book.	2001-06-15

Kerouac knew this from hard-bitten experience. The amazing thing about Jack was that when it was over, he could always sing about it in his books. he does so here in &quot;Maggie Cassidy.&quot;<br />I have felt the kind of stuff Jack talks about in this book. The illusion of teen &quot;love&quot; is one of the most wretched feelings in all the world...its elation is too high...too painful. Its ending is wrenching of the soul...usually quickly followed by the joy of illusory freedom. Still, it sticks your head for years after like an annoying song that won't go away--Keroauc gets all this down in one hundred and ninety-four pages...amazing.<br />Get this book. I recommend it highly to all who've been stung by what they thought was love when they were young.	2001-06-15

Through his wounds we are healed.<br />In &quot;The Challenge of Jesus,&quot; N.T. Wright does a good job of helping us to try and look at Jesus with our blinders off. Rejecting the thesis of Wrede, and following in the footsteps of Schweitzer, Wright believes that we can learn a good deal about the actual, &quot;Historical&quot; Jesus (my, how that phrase has been abused in the last half-century) through doing the work of history.<br />I praise Wright for attempting this grand task. &quot;The Challenge of Jesus&quot; is a shorter distillation of Wright's larger ongoing work which at the time of my writing consists of two published volumes (The New Testament and the People of God; Jesus and the Victory of God) with the series length now projected at six volumes total. This volume is no doubt aimed at a broader audience than Wright's more scholarly work.<br />Wright attempts to look at Jesus without the lens of a controlling theology. I like this a lot. We should always read the Bible for what it actually says, remembering the context in which they were written, and then build our theology from that foundation. Too often, we make up a theology and then try and fit its square peg into the round hole that the Word of God confronts us with...there is a word for this kind of thing: idolatry.<br />Wright manages to do a fairly good job of interacting with the Bible and history. He does disappoint me on his views of Jesus knowing whether he is God or not...he gives a waffling answer with unsatisfactory support.<br />Wright's Jesus comes out looking a lot like the Jesus of orthodoxy in the things that he did: proclaiming the Kingdom, Dying a sacrificial, atoning, and reconciling death, making clear claims to divinity (in spite of Wright's own weird view on the matter,) and being Bodily Resurrected on a Sunday morning...the startling part of the book is the perspective...Wright solidly locates Jesus and his message within the milieu of second temple Judaism...the results give a whole new spin on the Message of Jesus. For me, this book has strengthened my walk with the Savior.<br />In spite of its flaws, I'm giving this one five stars...it is incredibly thought-provoking. I recommend this book most highly.r,) and being Bodily Resurrected on a Sunday morning...the startling part of the book is the perspective...Wright solidly locates Jesus and his message within the milieu of second temple Judaism...the results give a whole new spin on the Message of Jesus.

As I write this, Amazon lists 1777 reviews already written for &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;...I sincerely doubt I have anything new to add to what has already been written...but Just in case:<br />&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,&quot; like its predecessor, is one heck of a story. I sincerely admire Mrs. Rowling's talent as a writer. She is a master of both suspense and humor. More than that, I find the morality of her protagonists most refreshing. Life is neither cut and dried or black and white. Her heroes are complex...just like real people. They have their faults, yet their hearts are in the right place.<br />I found the development of the characters to be one of the strengths of this book. We get to see whole new sides of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, Draco, Haggrid, and he who must not be named...<br />My favorite facet of the Potter books is the importance placed on friendship. As Proverbs 17:17 says: &quot;A friend loves at all times, And a brother is born for adversity.&quot; This is demonstrated nobly by the relationship between Ron, Hermione, and Harry.<br />I give this book my heartfelt recommendation. Reading it is truly magical.	2001-06-15

It is a fun story that packs a message.<br />The other stories are entertaining as well:<br />&quot;The Rabbit, the Bear and the Zinniga-Zanniga&quot; is about a wily rabbit who escapes from a hungry bear by the use of its wits.<br />&quot;The Big Brag&quot; has a particullarly funny ending. A little worm chastizes to the Bear and the Rabbit for having nothing better to do than sitting around and bragging about their capabilities.<br />&quot;Gertrude McFuss&quot; is about the insidiousness of envy. One feather...two feathers...we always seem to want more. This is interesting reading for those of us here in America which is absolutely driven by consumerism--which is really just envy wearing its &quot;Sunday Best.&quot;<br />Yertle the Turtle is yet another jewel in the crown of the doctor...I recommend this book.	2001-06-15

The characters in &quot;War in Heaven&quot; are plagued by everyday demons long before they encounter any exceptional ones...Williams takes these lives, and in a most un-quiet way...builds an entrancing story--one that shakes the reader to the core.<br />This is one of the scariest books I've read in a long while. The presence of evil is palpably felt in the antagonist of the book...a very creepy kind of evil...not your run of the mill stuff.<br />I don't want to spoil the plot (not to mention that the plot is a little hard to describe-owing to the fact that so much of what is import in this book has little to do with story line--so much of it is &quot;in the moment.&quot;) So all I will say here is that the conclusion is well worth the &quot;dry spots&quot; one finds in the prose. It is one of the most beautifully written scenes I have ever come across in English Literature.<br />I recommend this book...but not to the faint of heart.	2001-06-14

I have to say that this is the best introduction to Merton that I have yet to find. I'm not saying this is the best Merton biography--there are a surplus of wonderful books about this amazing monk (Pennington's book and some of Shannon's other works spring to mind)--what I'm saying is this is the best introduction for those wanting to jump into the study of Merton.<br />Something of a Rebel is broken up into four main sections:<br />The first section is a very readable, as well as entertaining, biography of Merton. This is broken up into two sections itself: the pre- and post monastic years of Merton's life. This part is most skillfully told by Shannon who himself proves to be a talented and interesting author.<br />The second and smallest section of the book is an argument for why reading Merton is important today. I must say I was already convinced coming into the argument...but Shannon makes a clear and forceful case for reading Merton all the same.<br />The third section is a walk through a &quot;gallery&quot; of Merton's most prominent themes... This too is very entertainingly written. It engages the reader in admirable fashion while dealing with subject matter that could have come off as &quot;dry.&quot;<br />The book concludes with a section on how to begin reading Merton's work for oneself. It discusses which of Merton's works are most important as well as what Merton thought of his own books. This is a useful tool. Merton's corpus of work is huge--a veritable raging sea of paper. Shannon shows where it is best to set sail.<br />Something of a Rebel is an excellent introduction to Thomas Merton and his works. William Shannon has done a service to all those interested in Thomas Merton. I recommend this book.	2001-06-07

Kaplan deftly traces the possible fault lines of future conflicts and global problem spots. His conclusions give fresh urgency to the Biblical injunction to &quot;be shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves&quot; (Matthew 10:16).<br />&quot;Eastward to Tartary&quot; is not your typical piece of travel writing. It not only describes the areas dealt with, it analyzes the possible future of each region. The book is no mere academic missive written by a policy wonk either. Chapter after chapter, Kaplan demonstrates his skill as a writer. He is a true craftsman with words. I read this book quite quickly due to how compelling and well written it is. Each chapter draws the reader into the next.<br />Books like this should be required reading for leaders in the West. Not everyone will agree with Kaplan's conclusions. This notwithstanding, &quot;Eastward to Tartary&quot; is one heck of a wake-up call. I recommend it highly.	2001-06-06

It has taken me some serious time to read and digest--and every moment was worth it.<br />&quot;End-Time Prophecies of the Bible&quot; has renewed my faith in the study of as yet unfulfilled prophecy.  In recent years, the mention of &quot;end-times&quot; have sold a lot of books--most of them incredibly poor, bigoted, and shallow. This is not the case with Haggith's work.<br />In &quot;End-Time Prophecies of the Bible&quot; David Haggith has collected all of the passages which can possibly be thought to spoken of as &quot;end-times&quot; related, and has meditated on them in a serious, sober manner. There is no sensationalism to be had here...only a longing to grow closer to the God revealed in the Bible.<br />I had difficulty in several places. My biggest problem being that I prefer to use a more modern translation of the Bible. Yet, this book is rewarding. One need only keep at it.<br />Which brings me to another point--Haggith should receive a medal of some sort for the length of his book. Many publishers discourage so called &quot;Christian&quot; authors from writing books much longer than two hundred pages--it seems they think the average Christian reader too simple to handle much more than that...needless to say, I take issue with this position. I do not believe Haggith could have done as complete of a job with a shorter book. I applaud him for not trying to insult the reader's intelligence with any less.<br />I appreciate this book deeply. I therefore recommend it highly. I leave you with one of the closing passages of the book:<br />&quot;Prophetic images go beyond doctrine. They are for meditating upon. They work in the domain of the subconscious. The mind that meditates on these images meditates on the indefinable God. Do not expect this God to come into perfect resolution. If you understand him completely, you do not understand him at all, for you have made him much too small.&quot;made him much too small.&quot;	2001-06-06

The mind that responds to the intellectual or spiritual values that lie hidden in a poem, a painting, or a piece of music, discovers a spiritual vitality. This vitality lifts the mind above itself, and makes it present on a level of being that it did not know it could ever achieve.&quot;<br />There is a great spiritual vitality in A.S. Byatt's &quot;Elementals: Stories of Fire and Ice.&quot; From the first story of this collection to the last...these stories forcibly pull the reader out of the ordinary and into the wonder of life. This little book packs a wallop. Each of the stories are little masterpieces.<br />The first story, &quot;Crocodile tears is a journey of self-discovery through the reawakening of a woman's curiosity. In the second story the reader looks into the life of an artist obsessed with his art. My favorite piece is the fairy tale &quot;cold.&quot; &quot;Baglady&quot; is one heck of a scary story. &quot;Jael'' is a glimpse into the soul of a woman unwilling to admit that she is haunted by her past. The final tale is a masterpiece that demonstrates how the way we see the world affects the way we live in it.<br />In the King James version of the Bible (which Byatt seems to have a love/hate relationship with) Paul says: &quot;For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known&quot; (1 Corinthians 13:12). These stories, as with all of Byatt's work, contain stunning visual imagery. One cannot read these tales and still view the everyday world through the same eyes.<br />If you find yourself with a chance to do some &quot;summer reading&quot; anytime soon, let me encourage you to start here with this book. I recommend it highly.	2001-05-31

Its about a kid who imagines strange creatures lurking in the dark corners and behind the objects in his house.<br />The story begins with the Zamp in the Lamp and builds to the crescendo of the Tellar, Nellar, Gellar, Dellar, Bellar, Wellar, and Zellar in the cellar. The book ends nicely (especially for the purpose of getting one's kids to sleep) with a Zillow on a pillow.<br />I'm a big fan of Seuss. This book, while not being one of his truly great &quot;MASTERPIECE&quot; masterpieces (my favorite being The Sleep Book), is still one of those typically Seussian mere masterpieces--remarkably fun and entertaining--especially great for the youngest of readers.<br />I must also take a moment here to once more praise the near indestructibility of board books...even my kids can't destroy them.<br />All in all &quot;There's a Wocket in my Pocket!&quot; merits a hearty recommendation.	2001-05-25

Wright are both very interesting authors. I have found some of Wright's works very interesting. Even though I believe Borg to be Theologically off his rocker, at least the man writes well. Though not in the least convincing, I found Borg's book, &quot;Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time,&quot; to be at the very least--worth a laugh. Now for my thoughts on this book...<br />I cannot bring myself to recommend &quot;The Meaning of Jesus.&quot; Both of these authors are gifted writers. Yet one feels they were constrained in the writing of this book. Both authors suffer from lack of space.<br />Borg, sees the Gospel stories of Jesus as a developing tradition, and a metaphorical one at that. Borg therefore holds very heretical beliefs: no virgin birth, no resurrection, Jesus not believing himself to be God.<br />Borg's greatest strength is his personal story--he has a certain kind of magnetic personality that resonates with many who reject orthodoxy. Unfortunately for him, he is not given the space in this volume to spin his personal tale as deftly as he does in his own works. His personal story tends to make many readers sympathetic to him and softens the tone of his often polemical arguments.<br />Wright, meanwhile, is usually a very nuanced and thoughtful author. He seeks to place Jesus in the context of first century Judaism. His picture of Jesus is much closer to traditional Christian belief than that of Borg while at the same time providing a strikingly unique view of Jesus. However, Wright is also hindered by not having proper space to elaborate on the basis of his thought and the importance of his arguments.<br />The Wright we meet in this volume is a strained, rather than distilled version of the Wright one encounters in his own excellent volumes &quot;The New Testament and the People of God&quot; and &quot;Jesus and the Victory of God.&quot;<br />I am firm believer that there is no greater pursuit in life than trying know and have a relationship with God. Although I do not agree with many of their conclusions, I commend both of these men for their honesty and the spirit of worshipful fellowship with which they wrote this book. I wish more biblical scholars would have the courage to lay aside their agendas and seek the truth as ruthlessly as these two men have in their careers.<br />Yet, I still recommend that the reader not start with this volume.

Little time to read and less time for reflection left a bad impression of Thoreau in my mind that has, as I said, only recently been overcome.<br />But now, upon my return, I have found &quot;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers&quot; by Henry David Thoreau to be a very invigorating book...one to be savored and not read too quickly. Taken at a good pace, it has been a joy.<br />While transcendentalism still strikes me as a rather facile and egotistical philosophy, I have really come to see and appreciate the mystical quality in Thoreau's works. Like most mystical authors, Thoreau is not always engrossing--he is actually rather tedious in points, but his work is punctuated by passages of sheer brilliance.<br />Seeing nature through Henry's eyes has been a wake up call to me personally. This book breathes excitement and lust for life upon the reader. Even his long winded discussions of different kinds of fish serve to alert me to my own lack of wonder. This world, even in its current subjection to futility , is still a wonderful creation. Nature (and Thoreau's picture of these rivers especially) echo the declaration of the Psalmist: &quot;The heavens are telling of the glory of God; And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands&quot; (Psalm 19:1).<br />I highly recommend this wonderful book.	2001-05-15

God in His very Trinitarian being lives in community. Christ lived in community during the years of His ministry. If nothing else, it would seem that we are called to live in community.<br />&quot;How to Lead Small Groups&quot; by Neal F. McBride is a &quot;must have&quot; resource for those seeking to live the Christian life in a community setting. This is a small but invaluable book.<br />  Mr. McBride lays our clear, Biblical foundations for small group ministry. He states (and then demonstrates) that: &quot;of all the potential ministry formats available to the local church, small groups have the greatest biblical support.&quot;<br />From this solid foundation, McBride then lays out a picture of a small group leader. The rest of the book is spent going over basic group dynamics as well as troubleshooting tips for commonly encountered problems.<br />I highly recommend &quot;How to Lead Small Groups.&quot; It is one of the best small groups resources on the market.	2001-05-03

So, in that regard at least, a commentary like this one is always a blessing.<br />I received &quot;The New Jerome Biblical Commentary&quot; as a Christmas present (I'll try not to let that cloud my judgment). It is truly a massive tome...parts of which are really useful.<br />I have referred to the commentary frequently since receiving it (in fact, it came in handy more than a few times as I've worked through a study of James' letter). Being as large as it is, the commentary has plenty of strong points and plenty of weaknesses. I'll only focus on the big ones.<br />The thing I found most useful about this volume was the actual textual commentaries...there are some useful insights to be found in these pages. In particular, as a non-Roman Catholic, I found the commentaries on the apocryphal books most interesting.<br />The most glaring weakness, as far as I am concerned, is the tendency of some of the authors (especially in the Pentateuch section) to get on a hobbyhorse of some sort or other and ride it to death. I don't know, maybe its just me, but I'd rather learn more about what the book says about people (God's message to us) than what people say about the book (academic theories).<br />Another interesting thing about this book is that it is really well written. In fact, I should give it a medal for being the first book with Ray Brown's name on the cover that did not put me to sleep.<br />All in all, &quot;The New Jerome Biblical Commentary&quot; is a book that is well worth acquiring. I recommend it.	2001-04-21

In fact, sixty years from now it is a good bet that the majority of the people we know and love will be dead. Death is one of the few truly universal things about life. If you live then you'll die. In his book, \\"A Letter of Consolation,\\" Henri Nouwen confronts the subject of death head on.<br />In October of 1978 Henri Nouwen's mother died following a prolonged battle with Cancer. Six months later, partly while on a monastic retreat, Henri Nouwen wrote a lengthy letter to his grieving father. Several years later, hoping that its message might help others coping with loss,  Henri's father encouraged him to publish the letter in book form. In this way, \\"A Letter of Consolation\\" came to be published.<br />The book is a keenly insightful look into a subject that few people ever think of before life's circumstances force them to. At a length of only ninety-six pages, \\"A Letter of Consolation\\" contains a staggering amount of thoughts worth pondering.<br />The early chapters of the book center on the grief unique to Henri and his father. Henri reflects on the loss of his mother as well as his father's loss of a life-long companion in his wife. Henri discusses how for he and his father living without Henri's mother made them find that &quot;Every 'normal' experience became for us like a new experience.&quot; Henri then goes on to write about the lessons that death brings. He writes of how loss increases love.  He reflects on how their love for his mother now has the added dimension of missing her.<br />As the book progresses, Nouwen begins to reflect more on the meaning of death itself. He reflects on what a crisis death is in the life of human beings. He writes of how lessons are to be learned from death. He speaks of how we must learn these lessons in order to be whole. He states: &quot;Still, hidden in us there are levels of not-knowing, not-understanding and not-feeling that can only be revealed to us in our moments of great crisis&quot;<br />\\"A Letter of Consolation\\" is a book about such much more than death in its simple everyday disguise. It is also a book that discusses death in the light of the  death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Nouwen first  introduces this subject by saying that death causes us to give up any  illusions that  immortality can be  achieved by our own strength and power. He argues that death is the clearest case available for demonstrating why we need to become utterly dependent upon God. Nouwen ends the discussion by talking about Christ Himself. Writing his father on Easter Sunday, Nouwen concludes:<br />&quot;I write this to you not to upset you but to console you in your grief. The lord who died, died for us--for you, for me, for mother, and for all people. He died not because of any death or darkness in him, but only to free us from the death and darkness in us. If the God who revealed life to us, and whose only desire is to bring us to life, loved us so much that he wanted to experience with us the total absurdity of death, then--yes, then there must be hope; then there must be something more than death; then there must be a promise that is not fulfilled in our short existence in this world; then leaving behind the ones you love, the flowers and the trees, the mountains and the oceans, the beauty of art and music, and all the exuberant gifts of life cannot be just the destruction and cruel end of all things; then indeed we have to wait for the third day.&quot;<br />My final judgment on this book is that it is absolutely worthwhile reading for anyone. It is for those who have experienced or are experiencing grief. It is especially for those who have not yet.<br />By looking through the window of the Nouwen family's grief, all readers stand to gain insight  into what the meaning of death and grief really is-- All of us who are temporarily confined to these perishable, mortal frames may turn to God (even in the darkest night) and rest with assurance in the knowledge that thedawn of the third is for us, still coming.nowledge that the dawn of the third is for us, still coming.	2001-03-19

We are seeking to live out the Spiritual Disciplines in our lives. I have found &quot;Spiritual Classics: Selected Readings for Individuals and Groups on the Twelve Spiritual Disciplines&quot; by Richard J. Foster and Emilie Griffin to be an invaluable resource in doing so.<br />The book is divided into fifty-two chapters which are excerpts from works by famous devotional writers of the past. Each chapter focuses on one of the spiritual disciplines from &quot;Celebration of Discipline.&quot; Each chapter contains an introduction to the author, the excerpt itself, a Biblical selection that complements the text, suggested spiritual exercises, recommendations for further reading, and a reflection by Richard Foster.<br />I found the chapters of &quot;Spiritual Classics&quot; not only useful...but thought provoking. Each chapter examines a different facet of the spiritual disciplines. The chapter on fasting by Catherine Marshall was particularly thought provoking for me.<br />&quot;Spiritual Classics&quot; is a great resource for those trying to live out the spiritual disciplines. I readily recommend it to anyone seeking to follow the narrow path of Jesus Christ. Get a copy today...and read it.	2001-03-11

It's not an easy thing to grasp. Maybe you understand it only by living it. And maybe Augustine was right on the money when he wrote: 'Give me someone who loves and he will understand what I am trying to say. Give me someone whose heart yearns, who feels the nostalgia of loneliness in exile, who is athirst and sighs for the fatherland eternal, give me such a one and he will understand what I am trying to say. But if I must explain myself to ice-cold indifference, he will not understand.'&quot;   <br />The preceding quotation is from Brennan Manning's &quot;Lion and Lamb - the Relentless Tenderness of Jesus.&quot; Lion and Lamb is a remarkable book from a remarkable author. My copy is especially remarkable ... it was given to me as a gift by a total stranger...and I am eternally grateful for it.<br />I had previously read Manning's &quot;The Ragamuffin Gospel,&quot; which is a great book in its own right. Yet &quot;Lion and Lamb&quot; holds a special place in my list of all-time favorite books. Few books are as packed with so much deeply freeing food for thought.<br />&quot;Lion and Lamb&quot; is all about how much Jesus loves us. Brennan uses personal illustrations from his own life and weaves them into tried and true teachings from years past to paint a picture of how much Jesus loves us. One example of how skillfully and movingly Manning extrapolates Biblical truths is found in the following excerpt:<br />&quot;My brothers and sisters, Jesus is our God. He and the Father are one. He is the image of the invisible God. Our Jesus image makes all the difference. If we let the Lion of Judah run loose as Lord of our lives, He will not want us to be poor, broken, or sad. Yet He may allow it, knowing that in these conditions we are more likely to let Him make us rich, whole, and happy. If you let the real Jesus into your life, the God whose supreme desire is your happiness and fulfillment, you'll want to throw out anything that is going to stop you from reaching His Kingdom. The brutal hyperbole's about plucking out the eye, cutting off the hand or foot, become understandable in this context-and in no other. Jesus' teaching is full of wild exaggerations, for Jesus is a wild man. And He says to us, 'It has pleased My Father to give you the kingdom.'&quot;<br />Amen.

All too often, we forget the lessons handed down to us by generations past.<br />My search for those lessons is what led me to this book: &quot;The Doctors of the Church : Thirty-Three Men and Women Who Shaped Christianity&quot; by Bernard McGinn<br />One the great resources I have found for unearthing the wisdom of the past is Paulist Press' wonderful series: &quot;The Classics of Western Spirituality.&quot; Having read a few volumes of the series, and having noticed Mr. McGinn's name was listed in my most recent volume as being the General editor, I decided to read something written by him. I found that &quot;The Doctors of the Church&quot; is an excellent introduction to and starting point for the study of the Catholic Church doctors.<br />The book begins with a chapter about what exactly a doctor of the Church is. It then moves on to discuss how each doctor got to be a doctor. I found these chapters interesting enough...but the prey I was hunting for here I only found in the next (and largest) section of the book.<br />The second section of the book consists of brief descriptions of the life and teachings of each doctor. This part of the book is ideally suited for those needing an introductory level overview of the doctors. More useful still, each chapter has suggestions for reading works by the doctor as well as McGinn's own bibliography of works about the doctor. This is an awesome way to make it easy to dive into the deep waters of the doctors' teachings.<br />The final section discusses the significance of the doctors to the Church today as well as where McGinn thinks the Church might turn as far as the naming of doctors in the future. This was again insightful, but less useful for my purposes.<br />Overall, I found &quot;The Doctors of the Church&quot; to be an excellent book. I glad I read it; and now, I recommend it to you.	2001-02-22

However, it was well worth it--because I switched to a class using Mr. Mounce's book: &quot;Basics of Biblical Greek.&quot; It is excellent!<br />Mr. Mounce is a genius at teaching Greek. It is simple that he should re-title the book to &quot;Greek for Dummies&quot; (lets face it--when it comes to Greek, we're all dummies).<br />The text book completely divides the nouns and verbs into two semesters. As a student who spent a semester trying to do both verbs and nouns at the same time with no system like the one Mounce uses...let me tell you: this book is very helpful.<br />Along the way Mr. Mounce explains concepts first in how they are used in English grammar. He then teaches the Greek grammar. This was most useful to me because my English grammar is a little sub-par.<br />Another quality of this book that I really enjoyed were the exegetical insights at the beginning of each chapter-it is always nice to know why what you are learning is of importance.<br />All in all, the &quot;Basics of Biblical Greek&quot; is a great book. I cannot recommend it highly enough. If you want to learn Biblical Greek, this book is the first book you will want to get a hold of.	2001-02-16

I have found that with rare exceptions, I simply do not care for the same kind of stuff the general reading population likes. However, in light of all the sound and fury in certain circles over these books...I decided I'd better see what all the fuss was about. So I have.<br />To put it as directly as I can: &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is an excellent book. It is well written, extremely entertaining, and is told in a delightfully humorous fashion.<br /> &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; tells one heck of a story. What is more--I found &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; contains a great message: appearances are not everything.<br />Harry is a noble protagonist. He's had a rough life...yet, he is not bitter. Harry forms a several friendships (be it with the groundskeeper at Hogwarts or those with his classmates Ron and Hermione) that really demonstrate the value of sharing life with others.<br />As in all great tales of fantasy, good and evil come are in sharp conflict with one another. At the very beginning of the book the story of how Harry's parents were killed by an evil wizard who they would not follow is graphically related by two of the other characters (by the way...the book's worth reading...but make sure your kids are mature enough). The bulk of the rest of the story tells of how Harry and his friends become embroiled in a struggle with evil years later while at wizard school.<br />I recommend this book. It is very entertaining and teaches some wonderful lessons. I would hope everybody who has criticized the book without reading it would consider actually picking it up and giving it a try. However, I advise asking yourself one question: are you old enough yet? C.S. Lewis once said something along the lines of (I'm paraphrasing here) people having to be old enough to love fairy tales again...<br />Are you? If so, get a copy of this book...you won't be disappointed.be disappointed.	2001-02-05

Paradoxically, in my experience those who wholeheartedly embark on this path will end up seeming both too Christian for their pagan friends and too pagan for their Christian friends.&quot;<br />This quote is from chapter one of Dick Staub's wonderful book: &quot;Too Christian, Too Pagan.&quot; The rest of the book explains this argument and gives &quot;how to&quot; suggestions for living this exciting and fulfilling kind of life.<br />Previous to December, I had never heard of this book or its author...Then a friend of mine received a copy of the book for Christmas. I didn't really think to much of it at the time (the friend has yet to read the book as far as I know) But then, through a series of events, This book kept entering my daily life through offhand comments, emails etc. I am glad it did!<br />&quot;Too Christian, Too Pagan&quot; has spoken to me right where I live. The chapter entitled &quot;Think&quot; is the first time I have ever read a contemporary Christian author address directly the lack of thinking that goes on in too many churches (Bob Briner and Mark Noll came close, but their topics demanded they spend more time on other things). I can testify to the truth of Mr. Staub's comment when he says:<br />&quot;I am warning you, in what is generally an anti-intellectual culture and Christian subculture, your commitment to thinking will make you countercultural.&quot;<br />I have felt this in my journey. So few really ever do think...many in fact, live in self-imposed prisons of the mind as a result. We must remember that Jesus told us to love the Lord with our minds to set us free...not to give us one more assignment in an already busy life...<br />As Mr. Staub continues to unpack his argument he gives wonderful &quot;how to&quot; advice. In other words, he does not make a case for doing things like thinking and then leave the reader stranded to figure out how to do so...he gives suggestions on what steps to take. In his chapter &quot;Read the Books&quot; he suggests reading not only the latest &quot;Christian&quot; bestsellers, but suggests we should read the fiction popular in the culture in order to understand the culture that so many of the people God wants to reach live in. In a wonderful passage about the power of fiction to shape lives and culture, Mr. Staub writes:<br />&quot;In my experience good fiction often functions like the canary in the coal mine. It sees life as it is, gasps out observations to those who will hear, and gives us a chance to puzzle through our questions, layering and thickening them with the life experience of another. Without saying so directly, through the characters and the situations they face, fiction can urge us to take action or face certain doom.&quot;<br />Mr. Staub suggests engaging culture by living the gospel: seeing, feeling, thinking, telling stories (like Jesus did), and being humble (among other things).<br />In the closing chapters of the book, Mr. Staub addresses the areas in which the church is currently failing. I appreciate the mix of love, optimism and faith Mr. Staub shows in addressing these subjects. Even with all our human frailties and weaknesses there is hope for the future if we keep our eyes on Jesus! Some of my favorite passages from this section are:<br />&quot;Many Christians have allowed political combat to replace making disciples and have allowed ideological confrontation to replace being a blessing or loving our neighbors...&quot;<br />&quot;The problem is not confined to political life. There is a growing and manifest distastefulness in the attitude of some Christians toward people disagreeing with them politically or ideologically. They possess an us-versus-them approach compounded by an unwillingness to listen and discourse about areas of disagreement. Today's argumentative society is more concerned with winning than in seeking truth and is therefore more comfortable demonizing opponents than respecting them. This phenomenon is not exclusive to Christians but concerns me most among Christians, because such attitudes are inconsistent with following Jesus and inhibit our effectiveness when communicating Jesus' love to the world...&quot;<br />&quot;The glibness with which some Christians enlist God's authority in their quest to trump the ideological landscape is a reflection of the shallowness of their recognition of God's otherness and the limits this places on their comprehension of God and His revealed Word.&quot;<br />&quot;Too Christian, Too Pagan&quot; is a great book (in fact--its early, but I'm gonna be hard pressed to read a better book this year). It covers a wide range of topics with consistently penetrating insight. I recommend this book wholeheartedly.

Vonnegut navigates this ethical minefield in an entertaining, yet sobering manner.<br />&quot;Mother Night&quot; tells the story of an American playwright who is enlisted to be a spy within World War II Germany. The playwright becomes part of the upper crust of Nazi society. Working as a talk-radio personality, he encodes top secret information in his pro-Nazi broadcasts. In so doing, he helps to bring about the eventual victory of the Allies.<br />The war-time story-line of &quot;Mother Night&quot; is told in retrospect by the playwright who is living a secluded life in 1960's New York City. The reason he must live in hiding is that his Allied contact person during the war disappeared. He has no one left to testify to the fact that he worked for the Allies.<br />The story takes off in grand Vonnegutian style as the &quot;protagonist&quot; of the story is discovered simultaneously by Nazi-hunters, Soviet agents, white supremacists, and a woman claiming to be his ex wife.<br />Through it all, Vonnegut asks hard questions about what action, motivation, intent, and reality have to do with reality.<br />I found this book to be eye-opening. It is engagingly told; containing passages of great beauty, sorrow, and even humor. I recommend this book.	2001-01-23
2129415:US	50593376	RAV6GYXRV0JE5	0374386137	598774312	A Wrinkle in Time (A Wrinkle in Time Quintet)	Books	5	10	12	N	N	fiction with a brain	&quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; by Madeline L'Engle is one heck of a book. It is so engrossing in fact, that I read this book in one day. I highly recommend it.<br />&quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; is fiction with a brain. It tells the story of how the Murry family (from the perspective of Meg) attempts to rescue their father from a place consumed by darkness. A lot of thought has obviously gone into creating the wonderful (and horrible) worlds in the story.<br />The Murry's are a family of scientists. Both of Meg's parents are in fact world renowned scientists. Yet Meg seems to be the black sheep. Outside of math, she can do little but be awkward. &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; is a story about how one's faults can become strengths. I like that.<br />Another thing I like about &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; is its focus on reality versus perception. The characters of the story learn in multitudes of ways that the unseen is often the most real...while the visible are often just shadows.<br />The whole book sings with an inner strength about things we all must face in our everyday lives. While the situations are ones I doubt any of us may ever encounter, L'Engle's solutions are profoundly earthy and true.<br />In this life where Angels so often look like witches or demons, (and vice versa) where our vision is clouded by the present darkness our fallen humanity...&quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; reminds us that the light is always there to shatter the darkness; and it is never beyond our reach.<br />I recommend this book wholeheartedly to everyone.	2001-01-23

I have never read a book quite like it. I am glad I did...it is a book with the power to change lives. I pray it has changed mine...and that it may change yours.<br />&quot;Uncommon Prayer&quot; is composed essentially of three elements. The first of the elements are the poems Berrigan wrote after reflection upon selected Psalms--they form the beginning of each chapter. Each chapter also contains a reflection written by Berrigan on his poem. The third element (and an indispensable one) that makes up the book are the stunning illustrations by Robert McGovern. Some of his illustrations throttled my soul.<br />Much of the reflection in &quot;Uncommon Prayer&quot; centers on human suffering and its relation to God. Subjects like life in prison and other horrors of the modern world are covered. Berrigan takes the Psalmist's ancient cries of anguish and suffering and appropriates them for our modern age.<br />Berrigan's personal involvement with many of the areas he describes gives this book an added power. The man who writes about how horrible prison is does so because he has been there (and not &quot;just visiting&quot; mind you).<br />The book was written when America was in a time of political upheaval. However, it does not, at least for me, &quot;date itself.&quot; Instead, Berrigan's righteous passion and fervor for the oppressed and threatened stirs within me a sense of holy anger at my own quiet complacency when it comes to social justice.<br />The most powerful chapter for me was the reflection on Psalm 130. Berrigan reflects at length on &quot;crying out from the depths.&quot; It is a powerful statement about the God we can cry out to...especially from the depths. I won't say more. You MUST read it for yourself.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2001-01-12

I see why it is considered a classic.<br />The story begins with the discovery that an interstellar object is approaching Earth at a great rate of speed. The rest of the book is centered on the exploration of this object; which is given the name Rama.<br />Clarke demonstrates why he earned the reputation of being a grandmaster of science-fiction storytelling as he uses both suspense and *gasp* thoughtfulness to unfold this tale of discovery and exploration.<br />I found the book to be very compellingly structured and told. Clarke's imaginative powers are in full force here. The Raman environment is spellbindingly fascinating.<br />The background of Clarke's humans is equally intriguing. There are only hints of a dystopian human civilization that has apparently colonized other parts of the solar system while retaining adolescent political (the council on Rama, the inhabitants of Mercury) and sexual (The captain of the exploration team) views.<br />One last thing before I give this book the recommendation it so richly deserves... I found the Raman &quot;sea&quot; to be one of the greatest ideas I have ever encountered in a science fiction book.<br />And, as promised above--I give this book a ringing recommendation.

Written in an engaging style and filled with excellent recipes, &quot;The Enchanted Broccoli Forest&quot; by Mollie Katzen has become my favorite cookbook. I received &quot;The Enchanted Broccoli Forest&quot; as a birthday present a few years back. The recipes range (just to use the soups as an example) from basic fare-Tomato soup, to exotic-Sesame Eggdrop soup. I dove right in. My first attempt was the Curried Peanut soup. It got scary towards the middle of the cooking time (The smell of the onions and spices being sauteed was wretched). But in the end, the soup was excellent! In fact, every recipe I have made from this book has not only tasted great, but has been fun to cook. I heartily recommend this cookbook.	2001-01-05

Each section is filled with knowledge that one hopes they never have need to know. How to survive such gruesome things as bear attacks and getting caught in a crossfire are the typical fare in the chapters of this book. My personal favorite is &quot;How to survive when your parachute does not open&quot; (after reading the chapter, I'm not sure I'd want to survive...sounds way too painful). In you want to read a semi-entertaining (all the humor comes from the dire grimness of the situations--which are dealt with in all seriousness) book about surviving in seemingly impossible situations then this is the book for you. I recommend it.	2000-12-24

The mortal characters of the story are eloquent representations of misconceptions of God that a lot of us share with them:<br />Some of us are like Sarah and her Father--we have a hard time trusting the God who, though ever present, sometimes seems quite hidden.<br />Some of us are a lot like Tobit--God is, for us, an all-too-ever-present scorekeeper who likes to stick his nose into all our actions and motivations in order to cast judgment upon us.<br />A lot of us are like Tobias--We simply ignore God in the midst of our busyness. The greatness of &quot;On the Road With the Archangel&quot; is that it acknowledges just how prevalent these human misperceptions are; and then moves on to a truer picture of God.<br />The story is told by the Archangel Raphael. Raphael gets involved in the lives of the human characters in order to answer a couple of their prayers. Raphael finds great humor in the humanity's misconceptions of God. A he narrates the story, he contrasts the mortals misperceptions of God with his experience of being in God's presence. In end, &quot;On the Road With the Archangel&quot; teaches us the same lesson that Tobit learns. We must come to the point (as Tobit finally does after his blinding and the events that follow it) where we stop relying on what we think of as our vision in order to truly see<br />This retelling of the apocryphal story of Tobit is both humorous and touching. Reading it is like a going to a spiritual optometrist. It helps us to see just how skewed our own vision of God is.<br />I give &quot;On the Road With the Archangel&quot; my full recommendation.	2000-12-19

As is usual with me, I was short on funds one day when I stopped by the local bookstore to get some coffee. I decided to get lunch and something to read to go with my coffee. I can be picky; and on this particular day I felt no desire to wade through the usual rhetoric of one of the national newspapers...So I went in search of a cheap paperback...and it was then that I stumbled across &quot;With Open Hands&quot; by Henri Nouwen.<br />I had read some of Nouwen's stuff before. I'd really liked some of it (the excellent &quot;The Road to Daybreak&quot;). Some of it had left me less than impressed (the mind-numbingly academic &quot;Wounded Healer&quot;). &quot;With Open Hands&quot; is neither excellent or poor--its actually pretty mediocre; but towards the good end of the mediocre spectrum (if there is such a thing).<br />&quot;With Open Hands&quot; bears the marks of being quite well thought out. One can tell that this book was labored over by people who cared. In fact, it is the result of Nouwen discussing the subject of prayer with a group of twenty-five theology students.<br />Hand imagery (clenched vs. open) dominates the book; but other undercurrents are palpably felt. Some of these noticeable undercurrents are: liberation theology, the writings of St. John of the Cross, and the idea of stillness or solitude. Nouwen, and the students he discussed prayer with, were clearly steeped in the classic literature on prayer.<br />The book is laid out in series of brief reflections. These are no doubt meant to be reflected upon at length. These reflections also progressively lead the reader into the next subject matter to be discussed.<br />&quot;With Open Hands&quot; is ultimately unsatisfying (as so many books on prayer are) because it spends most of its time dancing around the subject it describes. In so doing, it gives only a limited perspective on the topic. One is left feeling that some sort of suggested practical exercise or other way of letting the reader experience the subject being discussed would have strengthened the book. However, it is not without its high points or worth. Therefore, I give &quot;With Open Hands&quot; a heartfelt, if not ringing recommendation.<br />Other books on the subject of prayer that I would recommend are: Emilie Griffin's &quot;Clinging: The Experience of Prayer&quot;; Madame Guyon's &quot;Experiencing the Depths of Jesus Christ&quot;; Richard Foster's &quot;Prayer&quot;; and C.S.

It is a beautiful and super-informative volume. It is an invaluable tool for using while studying the Bible. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br />The Atlas is laid out in chronological order. It begins taking a general look at the geography of the ancient Near East. It ends with the expansion of Christianity up to 300 AD. In between these two time periods, the Atlas follows the sweep of the geographical history of the Israelites and the early Christians.<br />Every Chapter is filled with beautiful pictures, informative charts and lists, and excellent maps. I found especially useful the cutaway topographical maps such as the one used to vividly show the course of Joshua's military campaigns.<br />As great as the maps and pictures are...this atlas has a lot more to offer. Each chapter analyzes the economic, cultural and religious practices common in the time periods being discussed. Side bar articles discuss some of these issues in an in-depth manner.<br />In this atlas I found clear, visual explanations of several Biblical topics that had previously been nebulous at best in my mind. The chart on page twenty-eight alone is worth the price of the book. It is the first chart I have ever seen that clearly explains the relation between the Solar Months, the Hebrew Names of Lunar Months, the Feasts and Rainfalls, the Agricultural Activities and Pastoral Activities in ancient Israel.<br />Another great feature of this atlas that I have found useful is the bibliography for studying the topics presented here in greater depth...now I have more books to read!<br />I give this excellent book my highest recommendation.

The story is engagingly told and entertainingly illustrated...it is great reading for all ages.<br />As the story opens, Uncle Donald must send his three nephews (Huey, Dewey, and Louie) that he has lovingly raised off to be apprenticed in a trade. The nephews leave and are taught by a furniture maker, a farmer and a woodcutter respectively. The boys complete their apprenticeships, mastering their trades. As each of the boys leaves to return home, they are given a gift my their teachers.<br />The furniture maker gives Huey a magic table. The table can produce any kind of food one wishes. All one has to say is &quot;Table Set!&quot; The farmer gives Dewey a magic donkey. The donkey produces money out of its ear. All one has to say is &quot;Donkey, Donkey, wiggle your ear&quot; and the coins start falling out.<br />As Huey and Dewey journey home they each stop for the night at an old inn. The Innkeeper is the bad guy of the story. He steals the magic gifts given to the boys and replaces them with normal objects that look the same as the magic ones. The boys each return home expecting all the while that they still are in possession of the magic items. They both try to show Uncle Donald (who does not believe in magic) their gifts, but their gifts do not work and Uncle Donald mocks them for believing in magic.<br />Huey and Dewey figure out that the Innkeeper is to blame. They send a warning to Louie; who is finishing up his apprenticeship with the wood cutter. The wood cutter gives Louie a magic stick for the journey home. Louie uses the magic stick to retrieve the items lost by his brothers. He then puts on a wonderful show for his still doubting Uncle. Donald is amazed-and comes to believe in magic. They then live happily ever after.<br />Donald Duck and the magic stick is a classic children's tale. Like all great children's stories, it speaks to the hearts of adults as well as children. All of us, with the possible exception of the most childlike among us, are at least a little like Donald in this story. Each of us has some amount of hardhearted unbelief poisoning our souls. I know I do. Donald could not believe in magic. Many of us also bear the scars of our age and cannot wholly believe in the reality of the God and His love for us. We would do well to model our belief on the simple faith of Huey, Dewey, and Louie and heed the words of the Savior (from Luke 18:17): &quot;Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all.&quot;<br />I recommend this book very highly.of adults as well as children.

It is a book well worth reading...but it is also missing something.<br />I found Perpetua's Passion to be very well written and apparently well researched. Joyce E. Salisbury adeptly explores and explains the Roman and Carthaginian culture that Perpetua lived in. Mrs. Salisbury also seamlessly weaves into this tapestry a compelling picture of the Christian Church during the time of these events.<br />The book is based off of the diary that Perpetua kept during her captivity. Mrs. Salisbury explains the significance of Perpetua's actions in light of the culture of her day. She then shows the influence of Perpetua's story on the later Church.<br />All of this is very commendable. I was most impressed by the scholarship and insight of this book. Yet a question forms within me when I contemplate this book:<br />So what? Where is the heart in this book? There is nothing in this book which says anything about how these events speak to the soul of people today. Maybe I missed it...<br />What happened to Perpetua was more than a clinical historical event that affected the people immediately around her and eventually helped form certain patterns of thought within the Church. It was much more. It was a mortal being making an eternal statement. It was a moment in time where the Christian truth that there is more than this life was given a full embodiment in the actions of a young woman--A young woman who had every reason to live, yet for her, to die was gain. It was a moment of ultimate surrender, and at the same time, one of ultimate victory. The blood of the Martyrs is the seed of the Church!<br />In the end, in spite of my objection, I recommend this book. It is insightful and instructive. However, don't just read this book with your head. Approach this one with your heart and your soul.	2000-11-25

Let me be up front with my feelings about this book...I have a serious lack of trust for the editor.<br />After reading Kathryn Lindskoog's book &quot;Light in the Shadowlands, Protecting the Real C.S. Lewis\\" (see my review on October 30, 2000), I have deep concerns about Mr. Hooper. My consequent suggestion is that you skip the introduction if you use this book.<br />The real attraction here is the ability to read short excerpts from C.S. Lewis' works every day. As a whole this book is great for fulfilling that purpose.<br />I believe that I have lamented elsewhere that Christianity suffers from a plague of superficial and shallow &quot;devotionals.&quot; In spite of Mr. Hooper having had a hand in its creation (and the lion's share of its profits no doubt) &quot;The Business of Heaven&quot; suffers from neither malady.<br />These passages are excellent to reflect upon. Sometimes they stand alone. Sometimes several days reflect upon the same subject. They follow the Anglican Church Calendar for the year (Mr. Lewis was himself a member of the Church of England.)<br />As a person who is unfamiliar with the &quot;Church Year,&quot; I found this collection an education of sorts. The book contains charts for folks like me who need to figure out where the movable feasts fall on the calendar (They have their own readings in the back.)<br />&quot;The Business of Heaven&quot; is an interesting volume. I give it my recommendation in spite of my reservations...there are clearly better devotionals out there. I would suggest Brennan Manning's &quot;Reflections for Ragamuffins&quot; as a more worthy first choice.	2000-11-14

I first learned of him while reading one of my favorite books: Brennan Manning's \\"The Ragamuffin Gospel\\". Since that time of discovery I have read several of De Mello's books.  \\"The Way to Love\\" was De Mello's last book (published posthumously). It is at times both interesting and insightful. It is also horribly flawed. There are a lot of good insights into life to be learned from \\"The Way to Love\\". I find great value in the concept of awareness. Realizing that a lot of our joy is stolen by our societally programmed inner computer is of great worth in coming to terms with ourselves and living successfully. I enjoyed several passages of the book immensely. As an example of something that I found of worth in this book-this is an excerpt from the first chapter:<br />\\"And here is a parable of life for you to ponder on: A group of tourists sits in a bus that is passing through gorgeously beautiful country; lakes and mountains and green fields and rivers. But the shades of the bus are pulled down. They do not have the slightest idea of what lies beyond the windows of the bus. And all the time of their journey is spent in squabbling over who will have the seat of honor in the bus, who will be applauded, who will be well considered. And so they remain till the journey's end.\\"<br />I found passages like the one above scattered throughout the book. Each one was excellent at expressing a truth about the world. They show Mr. De Mello, who was a Jesuit priest, to be an eloquent writer with a powerful mind.<br />However, I have two bones to pick with this book. They are not quibbling, insignificant issues either. I believe that they contaminate this book to the point of negating its other values and making it impossible to classify this book as &quot;Christian\\".<br />The first problem of this book is one that starts in the first chapter, ends in the last chapter, and is present everywhere in between. Mr. De Mello starts each chapter with a verse form the Bible. That is not the problem...in fact, if more folks used the Bible is their writing the world would be a much better place. The problem is not that Mr. De Mello uses the Bible-it is that Mr. De Mello misuses the Bible. Time after time, Mr. De Mello takes the verses at the beginning of each chapter completely out of context. This practice is at best misleading and at worst (especially for those readers who may not read the Bible as much as they should) outright deceptive. A blatant example of this is found in the sixth chapter. Mr. De Mello essentially uses Matthew 8:20 (Jesus said to him, &quot;The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.'') to justify not getting overly attached to people. Unfortunately, this practice is not the worst problem with the book.<br />The second problem with the book is made much harder to detect by Mr. De Mello's skill as an author. It is also what makes the book one that I would not classify as \\"Christian\\". The first five chapters of the book are passably Christian, yet with a notable Buddhist influence. Beginning in chapter six De Mello starts to actually contradict scripture with what he says. To use chapter six as an example again: De Mello argues that we must not \\"overly attach\\" ourselves or be dependent on anyone or thing that we love. Detachment is a concept which is viewed as being positive in Buddhism, actually leading to enlightenment. In Christianity it stands in direct opposition to the kind of relationship we are to have with our Creator and Savior (1 Corinthians 8:6-- yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live).<br />My final appraisal of \\"The Way to Love\\" is that it has some worth...but not enough to outweigh its flaws. I cannot recommend this book. I suggest you avoid it. There are better books toread (If you haven't checked it out yet, try the Ragamuffin Gospel).read (If you haven't checked it out yet, try the Ragamuffin Gospel).	2000-11-11

Wright is a book well worth not only reading, but contemplating for some time.<br />As the extended title says, this book is a collection of \\"Meditations on the Cross and the Life of the Spirit.\\" Each of these meditations are wonderfully instructive. One reason why is that none of them come at a given topic from the same perspective. Each piece is not only well thought out, but also thought in a totally different way from the others.<br />The first half of the book is a collection of meditations on various bystanders at the crucifixion and their reactions to the suffering and death of Jesus. My two favorites are: \\"Son, we have sought you sorrowing\\", and \\"What I have written I have written\\". The former speaks movingly of Mary's role as Theotokos, the God-Bearer. The piece beautifully illustrates the role of Christians, more accurately-the call of Christians to be Theotokoi, God-Bearers, in the world of today.  The latter shows just how radical the message of Jesus was and is. It clearly illustrates how the call to follow the Savior has always been and will always be one that leads to conflict with the world.<br />The second part contains six pieces on various topics such as the call of God and the groaning of the Spirit.<br />My favorite piece in the second half is called \\"The New Creation\\". Which is a reflection on John 21 and what it means to live as a New Creation. This piece contains a wonderful passage:<br />\\"The word became flesh, said St John, and the Church has turned the flesh back into words: words of good advice, words of comfort, words of wisdom and encouragement, yes, but what changes the world is flesh, words with skin on them, words that hug you and play with you and love you and rebuke you and build houses with you and teach your children in school.\\"<br />I wish I could express the depth and insight of some of these reflections here in my little review. Unfortunately,  I am ill suited for the task. Since I cannot, you'll just have to buy the book and see for yourself.'ll just have to buy the book and see for yourself.	2000-11-10

No matter what your perception of Updike's &quot;take&quot; on the world (and while we're on that subject-let us not confuse the character's feelings and views for those of the author), one is forced to admit that Mr. Updike is a very gifted writer.<br />There is a lot to admire and be entertained by in The Afterlife and Other Stories. Mr. Updike clearly demonstrates why he is known as one of the greatest prose stylists of the past century. These stories make the things one would typically view as mundane come to spectacularly sparkling life.<br />The locations of these stories have a personality of their own. Houses and landscapes interact with characters in a ways that, while difficult to describe, are very character-like in their own right. This gives the stories a sense of wonder that is palpably felt throughout the book.<br />Forces of nature-the blowing of a breeze, a rainstorm, the heat of the day, the light of the moon in the middle of the night-all echo the inner workings and turmoil of the character's souls. This gives the book an almost spiritual intensity...something lacking in much of today's two-dimensional &quot;cookie cutter&quot; writing.<br />The Afterlife and Other Stories is rich in imagery, meaning, and irony. There are a lot of interesting points and perspectives for the reader to ponder. One cannot read this book without having been challenged, entertained, and moved.<br />The tales told in The Afterlife and Other Stories taken individually are very entertaining. Taken as a whole, The Afterlife and Other Stories is something very special.<br />Updike is a powerful writer. I have enjoyed several of his novels. However, I appreciate his short stories deeply. The Afterlife and Other Stories is probably my favorite collection of Mr. Updike's stories. I recommend this book.	2000-11-09
2223246:US	50593376	R3URNA9ZH73T2O	0060234849	607344832	Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia (Chronicles of Narnia)	Books	5	71	79	N	N	A tale of awakening	All of the stories in C.S. Lewis' excellent Chronicles of Narnia series are told in distinctly different ways. Prince Caspian could justifiably be said to be like an epic poem told in prose. It shares many qualities with other epics; most notably its beginning coming in the middle of the action. Prince Caspian, like other epics, contains a climactic battle. However, Prince Caspian (like all great epics) is not simply a book about battles. The great themes of Prince Caspian are those of awakenings, renewal and restoration.<br />As the book opens, the Pevensie children (Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy) are suddenly called back to the magical land of Narnia from a British rail station. They return to find that the land of Narnia is suffering from the oppression of the evil Telmarine King Miraz who rules with an iron fist. The king's nephew, (and son of the murdered rightful king) Caspian, has discovered the truth about Narnia and has fled the palace in fear of his life. In his flight, Caspian encounters some \\"old Narnians\\" who used to live freely before the Telmarines came to rule Narnia. Under the Telmarines, the old Narnians have been facing extermination. After initial mistrust, the old Narnians agree to stand with Caspian in an attempt to reclaim his rightful throne from his uncle and to save those that are left of the old Narnians from certain death. A struggle then ensues.<br />It is in the middle of this struggle that the Pevensies are called back to Narnia, where they once ruled as Kings and Queens. They encounter Caspian's loyal friend Trumpkin the dwarf. Trumpkin relates Caspian's story to them. The children agree to help Caspian. Together, the dwarf and the children set off to come to Caspian's aid.<br />It is on this journey that the Pevensies and Trumpkin learn the old lesson that  \\"The mind of man plans his way, But the LORD directs his steps.\\" (Proverbs 16:9) Forced to take a different route back to Caspian's camp than the one Trumpkin took from it, the children and the dwarf become confused and lost. They strive to the utmost limits of their human strength and find that it is not enough. It is in the darkest hour of this struggle that Lucy thinks she sees something on the horizon...a Lion.<br />What follows is a test of Faith for all involved. Lucy, being the youngest of the children and possessing the most \\"child-like\\" faith, overcomes her doubts. She is then visited by the Great Lion Himself, Aslan (Lewis' allegorical representation of Jesus). In one of my favorite scenes in all of the Narnia books, Aslan and Lucy discuss the lack of faith shown by the others and what must be done:<br />\\"Now child,\\" said Aslan, when they had left the trees behind them, \\"I will wait here. Go and wake the others and tell them to follow. If they will not, then you at least must follow me alone.\\"<br />This piece of dialogue is one of the reasons why Lewis is one of my favorite authors. In the span of three sentences in a children's book, Lewis captures the essence of Christ's universal call to be His disciples. Another amazing thing about Lewis (and another reason why he's a favorite author of mine)...is that the book grows progressively more spellbinding and instructive from that point in the story on. Prince Caspian is, like many of Lewis' books, a whole education crammed into a tiny little package--all told in a warm and humorous way. I encourage you to get a copy today. Then read it.

I cannot think of any gift I have received (except for my salvation) that has been more meaningful. This is a wonderful book. This is a great book. I am grateful to James Bryan Smith for writing it, thankful that Rich Mullins lived it, and I stand in awe of the fact that God the Father truly authored it all long ago.<br />This book, like the life it describes, is an arrow pointing to heaven. This is not a simple biography. This is no attempt at making a saint out of Rich Mullins. This book is a good long reflection on how God has uniquely acted and spoken through the life of one man.<br />\\"An Arrow Pointing To Heaven\\" is divided up into ten chapters (plus a wonderful introduction by Brennan Manning and an afterword by Rich's brother David). Each chapter centers around a theme that Rich sang or talked about often. The book comes with a CD with ten songs on it. Each chapter is named for a song on the CD. The songs express the theme of the chapter. The songs and themes are:<br />First Family (about the legacies our families provide), Creed (about the Church), The Love of God (about...the love of God), Boy Like Me/Man Like You (about trusting Jesus), Calling Out Your Name (about God and the beauty of creation), Bound To Come Some Trouble (about the growth found in struggle and pain), My One Thing (about the freedom of the simple life), Growing Young (about sin and temptation), Brother's Keeper (about showing love through our actions), and That Where I Am There You May Also Be (about death).<br />Each of these chapters taught me some great lessons. This book is life changing. The last three chapters in particular were really moving and challenging to me.<br />There are wonderful quotes by Rich and Rich's friends (as well as various other famous Christians) throughout the book. Some are humorous, some challenging, some emotionally moving, but they are all woven masterfully into the whole by the author. Some of my favorite quotes by Rich are:<br />\\"I would rather live on the verge of falling and let my security be in the all sufficiency of the grace of God than in some kind of pietistic illusion of moral excellence-not that I don't want to be morally excellent, but my faith isn't in the idea that I'm more moral than anybody else. My faith is in the idea that God and His love are greater than whatever sins any of us commit.\\" (Chapter 8)<br />\\"I think that part of being human is being alone, and being lonely. I think one of the stresses on a lot of our friendships is that we require the people we love to take away that loneliness. and they really can't. And so, when we still feel lonely, even in the company of people we love, we become angry with them because they don't do what we think they're supposed to. Which is really something that they can't do for us.\\" (Chapter 6)<br />\\"a spiritual thing is folding your clothes at the end of the day. A spiritual thing is making your bed. A spiritual thing is taking cookies to your neighbor that is shut in or raking their front lawn because they are too old to do it. That's spirituality. Getting a warm, oozy feeling about God is an emotional thing-there is nothing wrong with it-I think there is nothing more practical than real spirituality.\\" (Chapter 9)<br />\\"An Arrow Pointing To Heaven\\" is one of the ten best books I have ever read. This book speaks so much truth and love--the truth and love of Jesus Christ. I not only recommend this book...I urge you to buy it now. You will not regret it.ch are:<br />\\"I would rather live on the verge of falling and let my security be in the all sufficiency of the grace of God than in some kind of pietistic illusion of moral excellence-not that I don't want to be morally excellent, but my faith isn't in the idea that I'm more moral than anybody else.

Adler and Charles Van Doren is a very useful book for anyone wishing to give their books a more thoughtful, in-depth reading.<br />The book does have an agenda to push. That agenda is to see more people go beyond high school reading levels. The authors begin by reviewing how America got to the point where almost everyone could read, but very few people could read well. They offer the techniques in this book as a path from this superficial knowledge of reading to a deeper understanding of how to read more effectively and more deeply.<br />The book breaks down the levels of reading. They present four levels of reading: Elementary, Inspectional, Analytical, and Syntopical.<br />The most time and attention is given to Analytical writing. The authors present ways to read more analytically. They also lay out rules for giving a book a fair analytical reading. I found this part very helpful personally.<br />The other three levels of reading are treated in much less detail. Each is more presented than taught. The authors demonstrate how each level is dependent on the one preceding it.<br />This book is very well put together and nicely laid out. One can tell that this was a labor of love by the authors. A feature that I found particularly interesting was the suggested reading list in the back of the book.<br />How To Read A Book will be helpful to any reader who desires to learn how to read more deeply.

Using the journey, conversations, actions, and interactions of his main character, Christian, Bunyan draws contrasts between true Christianity and the vast array of opposing philosophies and opinions offered by the rest of the world. Each contrast demonstrates the superiority of Christianity to the perspectives and beliefs of the fallen world.<br />The story is told through the use of a narrative device. That devise is that of the narrator himself recounting his dream in which Christian makes his way to the Celestial City. The device serves to put the action of the story in context as well as a way break up the story into manageable segments. A key phrase often used in service of this device is: &quot;then I saw in my dream&quot;.  The narrator's dream begins in the City of Destruction; which is Christian's homeland. As Christian Journeys to the celestial city, he encounters many people and trials. Each one is representative of various worldly, or otherworldly philosophies or beliefs.<br />Bunyan has in all these encounters faced the problem of the truth of Christianity. If Christianity is true, how come there are all these alternative ideas in the world. Bunyan successfully exposes the weaknesses of the alternative ideas by refuting them one by one in the context of his pilgrimage allegory. Through his characters, Bunyan agrees with the apostle Paul. His argument is that our best weapon as Christians (once we have accepted Christ as our Savior and realized that only his grace is sufficient to save us) is to keep our eyes on God and the things of heaven (Colossians 3:2). All the arguments presented by the characters contrary to Christianity in this book add up to meaningless noise compared to the word of God and the truth expressed therein.<br />  Bunyan takes great care to steer clear of the idea that Christians are somehow intrinsically better than other people. He is careful to express that only God's grace working within them makes them capable of withstanding the trials of life. He demonstrates time and again that Christian suffers from the same weaknesses as normal people and is therefore prone to failure. It is only the love and assistance of God that allow Christian to reach his destination.<br />God's grace and God's grace alone are sufficient to save Christian from the perils he encounters in his journey. Any time Christian attempts to do something of his own accord, his plans go horribly wrong and God must rescue him.<br />The second part is about the travels and trials of Christian's wife: Christiana. It too is very instructive and entertaining.<br />Pilgrim's Progress is insightful as an allegory. It is instructive and would be useful reading for anyone currently alive and making there way through our current sojourn or &quot;pilgrimage&quot; here on earth. Anyone going to the real Celestial City would profit from taking a glance at this book as they walk along the narrow path.

There is no narrative. It is a collection of spiritual imperatives that Henri Nouwen wrote to himself during the worst spiritual, emotional, and psychological crisis of his life.

This is the story of the adventures of Giovanni, a poor boy whose ability to entertain brings him renown.<br />The book is full of beautiful illustrations. Tomie de Paola brings real love to the pictures. Giovanni, the people he meets, and the Italian countryside come alive in de Paola's renderings. The visuals in this book dance with color and emotion. However, there are things that run deeper than pretty pictures in these pages.<br />Henri Nouwen once wrote:<br />\\"There is a deep hole in your being, like an abyss. You will never succeed in filling that hole, because your needs are inexhaustible.\\"<br />Nouwen essentially said that the only solution in this life is to work near the hole. To avoid the twin temptations of dwelling in your pain or working so much that you drown your pain out with the noise of an overly busy life.<br />Giovanni is representative of all those who get caught in the snare of these temptations. He carries the hole, yet denies its nature. In his youth he believes his hole to be mere physical hunger. Allowing the rumbling of his stomach to overpower the groaning of the Spirit, he begins performing in order to try and fill his hole. Unfortunately, treating the symptom never cures the disease. As Giovanni grows older he avoids his hole by allowing the din of worldly success and the cheering of the crowds to drown out the insistence  of the still, small voice.<br />Only in the end, broken and unwanted by the world, does Giovanni heed the call within. It is a truly beautiful scene when he does. Get the book and witness it for yourself.	2000-10-12

Of all the writers of the twentieth century, this guy, Jack Kerouac, spoke  most eloquently to me in my teen years. Visions of Gerard was the first of  his books that I read. Whatever else one thinks of the author, it must be  noted that in this book there is a sweetness rarely matched elswhere.<br />Kerouac has a talent for uncovering the true secret serenity that lies  waiting behind the pointless muchness and manyness that often occupies our  time as we toil under the sun.<br />Kerouac's love for his brother is  palpable in the pages of this book. The beautiful poetry of Kerouac's prose  is like the free flow of a fountain sounding forth admiration and love for  Gerard.<br />Kerouac's Buddhism permeates the story as well. What I once found  fascinating, I now regard as misguided. Although Kerouac failed, as we all  must, to understand many of the inescapable twists and turns people  encounter in life, (&quot;Samsara&quot; in Buddhism) and although he  ultimately drowned in the &quot;stuff&quot; of life, this book shows that  he had a spirit free from the poison of hate. This, I must admit, is not  only noble, but worthy of emulation.<br />Altogether, I believe that Visions  of Gerard contains a good deal of beauty and much that is admirable in  character. It is a book worth checking out.	2000-09-17

In this book, modern Christians are confronted by a form of  Christianity that is altogether different from what we see in most of the  traditions that are prevalent in today's world.<br />The Carmelite story is  rich and colorful. It is a story of a spirituality with roots that come  from a fountain on a mountain (Mt Carmel) in the desert-and the saints that  first sojourned there. It is a song that sings beautifully of the themes of  failure and renewal.<br />Welch gives not only a great overview of the  history of the Carmelites; he also delves into the riches of Carmelite  teachings and thought; outlining a path for the modern pilgrim.<br />I know of  no better introduction to the Carmelite tradition. I recommend this book to  anyone with an interest in the life of and through the Spirit.	2000-09-06

Buying a copy of this book for everyone in America is the fourth thing that I would probably do if I suddenly became a multi-billionaire. Suburban  Nation clearly outlines what may be the single greatest (and possibly least  known) threat to our Republic: suburban sprawl.<br />More and more, we are  living our lives in little compartments of the world. We separate our  living spaces, where we attain our goods, where we make our living, and our  civic institutions from each other in distinct pods surrounded on every  side by dead seas of parking lot pavement and connected by costly and  inefficient &quot;collector roads&quot;. The authors of Suburban Nation  clearly outline how this came about (although they shy away from  controversy by consigning certain arguments to the footnotes).<br />The  suburban sprawl model is costly and inefficient. It is also socially  destructive. If we do not change the way we build our communities, (and it  is a stretch to characterize much of suburbia as being a community in  anything but name only.) we as a nation will only suffer further social  decay.<br />The reason I like this book so much is that it does not just  whine about our current situation. It presents logical solutions to  problems and encourages all readers to get involved in bringing about  change. In fact, the great solution proposed is an old model: the  traditional neighborhood. Traditional neighborhoods are not built alongside  a &quot;collector road&quot; but connected by street networks, where a five  minute walk, rather than a thirty minute drive, can take bring you to the  goods and services you need for day to day existence-or even *gasp*-your  workplace. In the traditional neighborhood the streets are narrow and  pedestrian-friendly. More than that, the neighborhood's interconnecting  street system provides (in a much less costly way) for less traffic  congestion than the &quot;collector road&quot; that suburbians are forced  to use.<br />Neighborhoods also help to diffuse a lot of the social ills  brought on by the divisiveness of suburbia. Neighborhoods have mixed  housing usages in any given area and are not homogeneously restrictive like  subdivisions. Neighborhoods have a clear center of civic life focused on  commerce, culture, and governance allowing for better life as a  community-as more people become included and involved...<br />I'm beginning  to ramble...read the book for yourself.

Paul Tillich should not be considered  to have been a theologian.<br />I know that some will object to my position by  saying something along the lines of: &quot;How can someone who has written  a systematic theology not be a theologian?&quot; Go ahead and ask. I know  of no sane person who has read his systematic all the way through without  having been compelled by someone higher up in the power structure of  academia.<br />This leads me to the thesis of my review. Tillich was not a  theologian or as some would no doubt suggest, a philosopher. I cannot put  my finger on exactly what he was. The most honest and least vitriolic  (though this book simply begs for vitriol) description I can provide of  this book is that it is vague. Tillich seems to want to make some  universalist and yet subjective statement about courage and anxiety, but he  never pulls the trigger on it. He dances round and round the subject,  leaving the reader both tired and queasy.<br />This leads me back to the  question of Tillich. Is this book the work of Tillich the theologian,  Tillich the existentialist philosopher, or an undefined, wholly other  Tillich? I don't know. However I do believe I know who Tillich was writing  for; and I believe this is the key to our question about Tillich,  meaningful as part of understanding the book, and of the utmost importance  to you as you consider whether or not to buy and read this book. It is my  sincere belief that this book was written for that all too common  half-breed that is found in our universities: the Liberal Academic (those  who are too lacking in honesty to be true scholars and yet still fearful  enough to admit their own atheism).<br />Tillich is still widely read by  captive audiences under the tutelage of these academics. This ensures why  this book is still read and discussed. This notwithstanding I urge you to  take my honest and heartfelt advice: don't read this book unless one of  them forces you to.and heartfelt advice: don't read this book unless one of  them forces you to.	2000-08-25

Green lovingly synthesizes a ton of material  about Francis into a story about what can happen to a fully human, fully  sinful person when they are touched by the love of God.

Of all the Seuss books, it lends itself most nicely to dramatic reading for children. It is a story  with a message that hits home in a personal way for the reader. On top of  that, the artwork is among Dr Seuss' most beautiful.<br />The story is  narrated by the &quot;bad guy&quot; of the story, the Once-ler. The  Once-ler is a business man who comes to a beautiful land full of wonderful  creatures and more importantly-at least as far as the Once-ler is  concerned-truffula trees. The Once-ler starts chopping down the truffula  trees so he can make their tufts into thneeeds (which everyone needs).<br />The Lorax is a small furry creature that springs from one of the  truffula tufts. The Lorax, like a prophet of old, warns the Once-ler about  the dangers of what he is doing. He stays with the Once-ler as the  surrounding ecosystem falls apart and dies. The Lorax also leads the  animals in his care to other lands where they can be safe from the  tribulations caused by the Once-ler's greed. As the Once-ler's destruction  of the area becomes almost complete, the Lorax literally lifts himself out  of the situation-leaving only a stone engraved with one word:  &quot;UNLESS&quot;.<br />The story begins and ends years later. The  Once-ler sits in his tower all alone; he is rich but saddened and  remorseful. His narration begins when a traveler comes to visit him and ask  him about the story of the \\"lifted Lorax\\". His narration, and the story,  ends with the Once-ler explaining the \\"UNLESS\\" left on the stone. The  Once-ler says that the \\"UNLESS\\" means that unless somebody cares a whole  awful lot, the things that have gone wrong will never be put right. The  Once-ler then gives his visitor the last truffula seed and says that what  happens next is up to him.<br />Dr Seuss' message about the environment is  both powerful and personal. I believe that both Seuss' condemnation of the  way things are going and his call for deeper caring about the environment  still ring true today. We need to heed that call in both words and deeds.  We humans are called to be stewards of creation. However, I also believe  that Seuss's book points to something else we should keep in mind. Romans  8:19-22 says:<br />\\"For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for  the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to  futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope that  the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption  into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the  whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until  now.\\"<br />Our failure as stewards probably has a lot to do with our fallen  nature. We are not as God intends us to be. The only way that we, as fallen  beings, can ever heed Dr. Seuss' eloquent call is through the grace and  power of our merciful Creator who loves both the creature and the  creation.<br />I recommend this book.

Prayer...descending with the  mind into the heart and listening for that still, soft voice. Prayer...the  language that we must use in developing our love relationship with the  Savior. Jim Forest's book, Praying With Icons, talks a lot about icons and  the art of iconography, but it is mostly about prayer.<br />I stumbled into  this book. The library I use most often has very few books in its \\"religion  and philosophy\\" section. I have read most of them. This book has kept  staring at me from the shelves. I did not pick it up because I thought of  it as an \\"art\\" book. You see, although I come from a family of artists, I  am not one of them-you might say I have an art \\"allergy\\". However, this  book has been persistent. Every time I have gone to the library...there it is  on the shelf (especially since it has only been checked out three times in  the three years it has called the library home-me being number three). I am  glad I finally caved and read it.<br />I am in many ways ignorant of the  traditions of the Orthodox Church. One of the great things about this book  is Mr. Forest's ability to put Orthodox concepts and traditions into very  understandable terms. He begins the book with a short history of icons. He  then briefly outlines the qualities of icons, what it takes to be an  iconographer, and ends Part I with a very brief but fascinating discussion  of the use of color in iconography. The section on color really intrigued  me. Each color represents some spiritual quality-for instance: \\"Blues are  associated with heaven, mystery, and the mystical life\\", while \\"Red, the  color of blood, suggests life, vitality, and beauty\\".<br />In Part II Forest  discusses prayer. He starts with a discussion of how human beings were  created with a need to pray. This need expresses itself in a multitude of  ways depending on the person, what they believe, or what kind of culture  they live in. Forest argues that in spite of all these differences, the  need to pray in some form-even if the person does not believe in prayer-is  universal. He then goes on to explain the traditional Orthodox way of  prayer. This section is most useful for those interested in the many  faceted jewel of prayer. Forest speaks eloquently of what some call  stillness. As I read more and more on prayer, and as I begin to experience  more and more of prayer, I am struck by what an awesome privilege it is to  enter into the quiet of God's rest. Forest is succinct and lucid (as only  one with experience of this kind of prayer can be) while discussing this  kind of prayer.<br />Parts III and IV focus on explaining different types of  icons and their spiritual significance. This part was not only very  interesting, but it changed my view on icons and iconography as a whole.  Prior to reading this book I was unimpressed with icons. I thought of them  as primitive pieces of art that bordered on idolatry. How wrong I was! I  now see the silent beauty of these masterpieces. They are truly prayers in  a visual medium.<br />Part V is a listing of prayers that are commonly prayed  in Orthodox services.

Whenever I read Lewis, I am struck by his intense clarity of  thought. This book is no different. Lewis is at his brightest and most  lucid in these pages.<br />A variety of topics-from the effectiveness of  prayer, to the end of the world-are covered in the pages of The World's  Last Night. Each essay (and the story) is brilliant in its own way.<br />Lewis is one of my favorite writers. I have come to believe that I like  him so much not because of his clarity or depth of thought-which are good  reasons for liking him-or even because we share a distaste for modernism  and all that it has done to cloud modern thought, but I believe what I  appreciate most about Lewis is his sense of humor. Lewis' humor is on  display in every one of these very diverse pieces. Even when I disagree  with Lewis, his humor humanizes him, and I cannot hold anything against  him. Contemporary authors could take a lesson from this.<br />Buy this book.  It is worth reading and rereading. If nothing else, the humor will lift  your spirits.	2000-08-05

This is going to earn me some unfavorable votes...but that's nothing new.<br />I liked the first book (see review June 26th). But I am now done reading this series. This book bored me silly. In fact I will not finish it. I kept thinking that it might get better; but somewhere around the point where Buck and Rayford are both mulling job proposals from the antichrist, I terminally lost interest. If you've ever wondered just how slow or overwrought a plotline to a story can get...here is your answer.<br />Not only is Tribulation Force horribly boring, but whatever happened to suspension of disbelief? Can anyone tell me why Hattie, Satan's new fly girl apparently, still wants to even speak to Rayford? I thought she didn't want to have anything to do with him at the end of the last book. Same thing with Buck...why in the world does Carpathia want to mess with him any further when he had already succeeded at destroying his career for all intents and purposes?<br />Let me offer a piece of advice: Do not waste your time reading this series which will probably be only halfway finished when the tenth book rolls around. There are plenty of edifying and entertaining books such as &quot;Till We Have Faces&quot; by C.S. Lewis (anything by Lewis is better than this), &quot;The Thanatos Syndrome&quot; by Walker Percy or even &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot; by Stephen King. Read one of these books-you will get a lot more out of them than the Left Behind books.<br />Books are like fish. Some are so good that you want to mount it on your wall for every one to see. Some you throw back. This one is definitely not a keeper.	2000-07-26

If you haven't, let me tell you why you should: The Horse And His Boy is an outstanding story. And that's not  all-you can read it without having read any of the other Narnia books; not  that you'd want to do that. All the Narnia books are wonderful.<br />The  Horse And His Boy follows the adventures of Bree (a talking horse) and  Shasta (a slave boy) who run away from their masters and journey to the  magical land of Narnia. Along the way they meet a nobleman's daughter,  another talking horse, a king and a queen, and a very special Lion (he's  not a tame lion you know).<br />I love this book. I love all the Narnia  books. C.S. Lewis is a great writer (now in glory). However, heed this  warning: this book is only for children and those adults who are old enough  to love fairy tales again.

Let me preface my review by reminding the reader that books about the &quot;historical Jesus&quot; tell more about the author than the subject...now about this  book...<br />I have never been a fan of any of the Jesus Seminar authors I  have read. They seem to lack Critical thinking skills as well as academic  honesty. I have found those I have read to be embittered with their  experiences of religion and lacking in a relationship with Jesus. However,  I like the acquaintance who recommended this book, so I read it. Some  impressions:<br />Mr. Borg does not seem as embittered as some of his  colleagues. He seems to have genuinely sought for Jesus. Mr. Borg Needs to  keep seeking (and he will find).<br />Mr. Borg bases much of his unbelief on  his inability to believe in the supernatural. The very question that  brought Mr. Borg into questioning his faith (How can God be in Heaven and  everywhere at the same time?) shows this tendency. This problem with  believing in the supernatural, combined with his swallowing (hook, line,  and sinker) of nineteenth and twentieth century liberal biblical criticism  (largely disproved), causes him to often step into some unsupportable (and  heretical) territory when it comes to what he does believe in. Mr. Borg  takes the Jesus Seminar party line by denying the virgin birth, sinless  life, substitutionary death, and bodily resurrection of Jesus. He even  throws in some extra new-agish &quot;Jesus was really in tune with the  spirit world&quot; voodoo-hoodoo for those who choose to believe in  something.<br />The only kind of belief I can see coming form the kind of  religion (and that's all it would be-a man-made religion-not a daily  relationship with our loving God). Mr. Borg espouses, is one characterized  by a lukewarm devotion concerned with moral living. Even if you buy Mr.  Borg's picture of who Jesus was, at least listen to Jesus' (the cynic-sage  spirit dude as Borg would have it) words. Jesus said this to the church in  Laodicea: &quot;I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I  wish that you were cold or hot. So because you are lukewarm, and neither  hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth.&quot; (Revelation 3:15-16)If  you ask me, these words of Jesus the Savior give great impetus for the  rejecting Mr. Borg's version of Jesus.<br />Mr. Borg continually places words  in the mouth and thoughts in the mind of early Christians. I wonder what  they would say if they could describe the thoughts contained in Mr. Borg's  book. I scrounged around and found two early descriptions of ancient  heretics. I think they fit nicely in describing the work of the Jesus  Seminar in general and this book in particular:<br />Basil of Caesarea  described heretics as &quot;Men who were altogether broken off and  alienated in matters relating to the actual faith.&quot;<br />Hippolytus said  that &quot;They seek not for what the sacred scriptures declare, but  laboriously set themselves to find a form of syllogism which may support  their godlessness.&quot;<br />I think Mr. Borg does not fit this description  completely; although I think much of his work does.

This is most  refreshing. No pet theories or speculation taint this book (I guess this  means Mr. Pelikan won't be asked to work with A&amp;E or Bill Moyers any  time soon.)<br />This book can be dry in spots.  This probably speaks more to  my distaste for &quot;scholarly works&quot; than any deficiency in Mr.  Pelikan's writing style.

The author's mastery of the English language is evident on every page.<br />Women in Love is also one of the most pointless books I have ever  read. Sure, there are some very interesting conversations along the way --  but (and a big BUT) everything else smacks of being false and contrived.<br />Considering its girth, there is very little action in this novel. When  there is action it repeatedly springs out of left field. All the action and  most of the conversation in this novel suffers from a fundamental  disconnection with reality.<br />Beyond all the other problems of this novel  is its flawed premise. Lawrence seems to be saying that the only way modern  man can ever escape the world he lives in is to be so passionate as to  overcome it. In this, Lawrence seems to be the opposite of a Buddhist. That  notwithstanding, Lawrence's theory also fails. How can being passionate  overcome a world system based on the passions of men? Just as Buddhist  withdrawl from the world of passion can never fix the problems of that  world, Lawrence's call for unguided passion would only add fuel to the fire  of a broken and fallen world.<br />In essence, Women In Love is beautifully  written, inherently flawed, and marred by the surrealistic motion of the  plot. I cannot in good conscience recommend a book this large, which when  finished amounts to a bad daydream.	2000-06-26

He goes even further in addressing each reader,  regardless of creed, as fellow human beings.<br />This book is written in an  engaging question and answer format.

The godless radicals of this novel (Shatov, Stavrogin, and Verkhovensky) are soul mates  to some of the most evil figures of the twentieth century (Hitler, Franco,  and Stalin.) They dance like shadows in a demonic firelight in the pages of  this book. The Devils plunges the reader into the shallow soullessness at  the heart of nihilism.

It contains the sixteen visions given to Julian who lived alone as an Anchoress in late  14th-early 15th century England.<br />This volume contains both the short and  long text of Julian's visions. Julian writes with a lucid depth of feeling  rarely encountered in descriptions of God's love. Julian's love for Christ  is clearly felt in these pages. The preface and introduction give ample  justification for claiming a place of importance for Julian's writings in  the pantheon of mystical and spiritual writers.<br />This is valuable reading  for everyone who wants to know the love of God more.	2000-06-13

Instead, he places the focus on God  and on how the creation and fall effect our lives as human beings.<br />Temptation is a poignant counterpoint to the story of the fall.

Cassian is, via the value placed on his writings by St. Benedict, a major figure in the history of western monasticism.<br />This volume contains nine of Cassian's twenty-four conferences. The conferences cover such topics as prayer, perfection, and purity of heart. By using the device of interviewing famous Egyptian monks and hermits, Cassian deftly distills the essence of early Egyptian monastic and eremitic teachings on these and other topics.<br />The scholarly introduction to this volume, written by Owen Chadwick, is indispensable for those wishing to set these teachings within the context of Cassian's life and thought. Mr. Chadwick, who has written a book on Cassian is just the man for this task and he does it well.<br />Colm Luibheid is both the translator of this volume and the author of its skilled and entertaining preface. Cassian's devotion and humor are brought to life in this translation.<br />Cassian still speaks to us today, one thousand six hundred after his death; in a world foreign to the one he was writing in. How can this be? It because the message of Cassian's writings: devotion and the quest to follow God in purity, spirit and truth, lies at the core of what we as human beings were created for. There is much here to help us (by the grace of God) along that narrow path which leads to the Father.	2000-06-07

The Seven Storey Mountain is the story of how he came to faith and the depth of wonder he found there.<br />Set  in the first half of the twentieth century, The Seven Storey Mountain  follows Merton from his childhood on until his entry into a monastery in  Kentucky.<br />I was moved by many of the details of Merton's early life: the  loss of his mother, his relationship with his father, and his adventures in  education. Merton skillfully lays out the background of these events. Time  and again, the common humanity of Merton shines through across barriers of  time, place, and experience.<br />This Book is a masterpiece. I recommend it.	2000-06-06

The Winter's tale is one of my all-time favorite Shakespearean  stories.<br />The story revolves upon tragicomic figure of Leontes, King of  Sicilia. Essentially a good King, Leontes buys himself a heepin' spoonful  o' trouble and grief because of his suspicion, envy, and foolish rashness.<br />I won't spoil the story here so I will end by saying that The Winter's  Tale is a wonderfully entertaining story of romance, loss, redemption and  restoration. It is of course superbly written; with Shakespeare tossing in  one of his great comic rogues: Autolycus.<br />This book gets my highest  recommendation	2000-06-04

Instead of being a straightforward biography, it seeks to extract the moral lessons from President Washington's life. This technique bears much fruit  for thought. Particularly, I was struck by Brookhiser's focus on George  Washington as the father of our country and how it speaks to us today-in an  age of broken and nonfunctioning families. There are many good lessons to  learn from Washington's life in this book. The one thing that keeps me from  giving this book five stars is Brookhiser's tendency to slant how he thinks  Washington would deal with modern issues (public education for example) in  a way that makes them very like Brookhiser's views. However, this happens  only a few times and as it is obvious when he is doing so, does not warrant  too much concern. I recommend this book.	2000-05-20

Either way, (I read it second-after The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and have now reread it after finishing the  series) it is an excellent book. It is the genesis of all the adventures in  Narnia; and is a masterpiece! A little boy named Digory and his friend  Polly are sent to a place between the worlds by Digory's  mad-scientist/magician uncle Andrew. From there they awaken an ancient  evil, witness the death of one world and the birth of another. In telling  the story, C.S. Lewis writes with both wit and skill. His grasp on human  nature is both insightful and entertaining. This book serves as a parable  for our own creation and fall. It is a book I recommend to people of all  ages.	2000-05-19

Three hundred and seventy-one pages of bigoted opinion. This book was written with such bias that it is hard to believe people would even consider taking it seriously. Mrs. Armstrong's  unsupported assumptions form the very basis of the work. She assumes that  Marxist sociological conflict theory is inherently true. Armstrong also  assumes that &quot;religion&quot; (particularly fundamentalism) can only  respond to a secular society. Over and over Armstrong stresses that  fundamentalism is a fearful response to those secular societies in which it  exists. She glibly assumes that &quot;fundamentalism&quot; is a twentieth  century invention. Beam me up Scotty! Has she never heard of a city called  Geneva or a Man by the last name of Calvin? For all the praise lavished on  this book for its &quot;panoramic view&quot; of the history of  fundamentalism, one is left wondering where all the history is. Perhaps  Mrs. Armstrong was only covering the history of fundamentalism on the moon.  She certainly leaves out names (only to name some Christians, although many  could be named from both Islam and Judaism) such as Bunyun, Edwards,  Spurgeon, and Whitefield. I am saddened that this book will probably be  read by people seeking to understand &quot;fundamentalism&quot; and who  will only find Mrs. Armstrong's narrow definition of it. Mrs. Armstrong  misses the theme which runs through fundamentalism in all three of the  monotheistic faiths. These &quot;fundamentalisms&quot; are not built on a  foundation of fear but on a heartfelt desire to grow closer personally to  the almighty God of the universe. Yes, as Mrs. Armstrong has pointed out,  politicians in many lands have tried to use fear to sway the fervent of all  faiths; but those that are swayed are by definition not the faithful. Mrs.  Armstrong would know this if she were truly trying to understand  fundamentalism as she claims. To sum it up-do not be fooled by Mrs.  Armstrong's faux attempt at &quot;understanding fundamentalism.&quot; The  only thing to find here is veiled condescension and contempt. Its not worth  the price.ttempt at &quot;understanding fundamentalism.&quot; The  only thing to find here is veiled condescension and contempt. Its not worth  the price.	2000-05-11

I was concerned that the Norton Anthology (which now uses this version of Beowulf) had replaced a fine scholarly translation with one by a &quot;name&quot;  writer. Although I still prefer the old translation to this one, I feel  Heaney deserves credit for a good, if not earth-shattering, translation.  Truly written from the heart of a poet, this is a better translation than  most. I recommend it to those already familiar to Beowulf. It is an  interesting counterpoint to more traditional translations.	2000-05-11

I particularly recommend &quot;They  flee from me&quot; by Wyatt. There be giants here... and Shakespeare stands  upon their shoulders.	2000-04-27

However, this book is worthwhile; although disagreeable in many  ways to my particular worldview. Let it never be said that Mr. Morrow does  not have a brain. A lot of thought has obviously gone into this book. I  just hope all those who read it put forth some of their own in  response...this book deserves it.	2000-04-27

John Adams: A Life is biography at its best. In this one volume, readers follow John Adams from the cradle to the grave. The journey holds both triumph and  tragedy; and is well worth it. My favorite part of the Journey is Ferling's  description of the pre-Revolutionary and Revolutionary years of Adams life.  The writing is excellent. I was deeply saddened to learn of Adam's later  years when he fell prey to empty deism. All in all, this book earns my  highest rating.	2000-04-27

The weeds  choke and finally kill of the lilies. Yet behold! What is this? A beautiful  Lilly among the weeds and grass...A Diary of Private Prayer is not like  other &quot;devotionals.&quot; The prayers are honest, thoughtful, and  wonderfully lacking in self-consciousness. I do not believe we should go to  God with a script. I do believe however that these prayers distill many  things which are not commonly considered into a useful form for meditation  and for drawing one into a personal relationship with God. I recommend this  book.	2000-04-27

Dallas  Willard has clearly been gifted by God as both an author and teacher. He  exhibits these gifts in this wonderful book. One cannot read this book and  not be challenged. Discipleship is not for just the few. It is a demand on  every Christian. We are not following the call of Christ if we do not heed  the call to discipleship. Mr. Willard seeks (quite effectively) to lead us  in this path. I beseech you ... wherever you are spiritually, get this book  and then read it.	2000-03-09

Although  the prose is sometimes rough or overly drawn-out in places, I cannot  imagine this book being written any other way. Also, this book contains  passages that convey great beauty. I recommend this book to all who have  finally grown old enough to love fairy tales again.	2000-01-27

I have had the pleasure now of having read a great deal of Austen's works. She had a knack for depicting human nature in a very skillful and entertaining manner. My one regret in my reading of Austen is that I  started with this book. This book is skillfully written, with lush  language. My problem is that the ending is so surreal and sudden. I do  recommend this book; but not for beginners. If you are only starting with  Austen, read Persuasion or Emma first.	2000-01-25

However, one cannot read this from a Christian  perspective and not feel pity for this talented man who never really found  what he was looking for.

I feared the worst. Would this book, like so many others, misrepresent my God in the name of an ideology? So many &quot;Christian&quot; books about politics merely adopt  whatever worldly views best mesh with their limited vision of God. These  books never seem to notice the falleness of the world. They do not see the  flaws inherent in all purely human attempts to &quot;better&quot; the  world. This book does not fit this description. This book outlines the  depths to which our falleness causes us to stoop. This book stresses the  importance of Natural Law and the importance of our response to it. This is  a fascinating book which I can heartily recommend to all.	2000-01-05

This book and the work of the Jesus Seminar as a whole, claims to be &quot;scholarly.&quot; The members of the Jesus Seminar paint themselves as  bold crusaders for the &quot;truth.&quot; Robert Funk, the editor of this  title, even goes so far as to cast himself in the role of a modern day  Galileo- suffering persecution for the truth. He has made it his life's  work to free the &quot;historical Jesus&quot; from the constraints of  orthodoxy in order to help launch a new era in which the real  &quot;historical Jesus&quot; is liberated from religious and political  (i.e., conservative) propaganda.  I myself am all for scholarly  investigation into the person of Jesus Christ. Mr. Funk however, has never  done anything of the sort. Mr. Funk admittedly feels that he has an ax to  grind with his own fundamentalist childhood. From the issues Mr. Funk has  with his childhood, spring the biases that pervade his  &quot;scholarship&quot; and skew his viewpoint.  According to Mr. Funk,  modern science renders unacceptable the supernatural world picture  contained in Scripture. Mr. Funk seeks to reject orthodox views of the  crucifixion, resurrection, miraculous birth and divine infancy of Jesus. He  does so on no basis of evidence or proof. He does this on faith alone.  These are the assumptions and that he lays as a foundation for his further  &quot;study&quot;. All are subjective and unproven; some strikingly  arbitrary. That said, he attempts to put this questionable, third century  text on the same ground as the canonical gospels. I am not convinced. Take  my advice: don't waste your time here.	2000-01-05

I find joy in reading Eugene Peterson's take on the Bible. Mr. Peterson has great skill as a writer. However, I do not put this on the level with the inspired word of God.  The  Message is inconsistent in its use of Modern and Ancient terms. Jesus reads  a scroll while Paul reads books. The Message is a paraphrase of the Bible.  The problem is that the untrained reader does not know where the text ends  and the commentary begins. While the Message at points does clarify certain  points within the text, it is often overly self-conscious in its literary  idiosyncrasies.  The Message adds significantly to the text. Many passages  go beyond what is stated in scripture. &quot;You are the salt of the  earth&quot; becomes &quot;Let me tell you why you are here. You're here to  be salt-seasoning that brings out the God-flavors of this earth&quot; The  Message also tends to obscure certain theological issues by generalizing  them. In spite of all this, I do recommend the Message-with two  reservations. The first reservation is that this must not be bought as a  Bible. The second is that the buyer should read it and compare it with a  suitably reliable translation (NIV, NASB, NKJV, etc.)  The Message is fun.  It is not the Word of God.	2000-01-05

This Book is useful- if you buy it for the right reason. This is not a book in which you will find the latest gimmick which &quot;brings you closer to God.&quot; This book is more of a history lesson mixed with  advice. I have problems with the introduction. It is written by a Buddhist  who tries to say that there is no big difference between Christ and Buddha.  I do not feel this man should be allowed to push his agenda in this place  just because the man was Merton's friend. However, we can overlook this,  for the rest of the book proves more intelligent and useful. In this book  Merton walks through the history of monastic thought about prayer in a step  by step manner. His commentary is useful in seeing how the different ideas  about prayer came about. He does tend to have a bias towards his own ideas.  Therefore, I recommend this book to those interested in the history of  prayer in the monastic tradition. I cannot however, endorse this book in  good conscience to those seeking to learn about prayer itself. For those  interested in learning about prayer in and of itself, I suggest Richard  Foster's book on the topic.	2000-01-05

I heartily  recommend purchasing this book.	2000-01-05
