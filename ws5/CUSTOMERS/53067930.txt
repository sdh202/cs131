In all my readings about science and men of science, it became quite clear that many of the most important discoveries were made by men who were not only from families of wealth and prestige, but also men who were trained for one area (such as law or diplomacy or finance) who later in life found that their avocations became their life-long pursuits; often to the good of mankind. In Alfred Loomis, there came a mixture of innate abilities in finance, physics, diplomacy, and plain-old curiosity, of the like we may never see again. Part of this is because of the type of education that Loomis received as a member of the elite class of American aristocracy. Part of it was the sheer genius that was Loomis. <br /> <br />I cannot neglect to mention the fact that men of this caliber seem to come when they are needed; and at no time in history did we need men who could successfully draw together men of science and men of military background, and politicians, in order to literally save the world from the likes of madmen like Hitler and his cronies. <br /> <br />It also struck me in reading this outstanding book of biographical quality, that the current trend of specializing in so many fields such as medicine and physics, is not helping these fields to grow. As someone who was deeply involved in Neuroscience and then went into teaching, it became quite clear that the information that would most likely help teachers to teach their diverse students well (and meet their needs) was not reaching those who needed it. All the current knowledge concerning how people learn, how certain conditions interfere with learning (such as Attention Deficit) do not successfully filter down to teachers who can use this information for making changes.  <br /> <br />This book is an outstanding biography of a type of man of which we desperately need more. Loomis was not in physics, science, in the work he did for the military on microwave, radar, etc. for the money or for fame. He walked away from both. He also was astute at finding young men who had qualifications and abilities that could be used in the areas they desperately needed in radar and the like. <br /> <br />Loomis was not a perfect man. Few are; but circumstances often contrived to put these men into situations from which they found it difficult to extricate themselves. The men of the early 21rst century aristocracy in the U.S. were expected to marry within the same types similar to how European royalty marry...whether or not those persons had similar interests, or were even of a mentality whose needs could be met. Loomis' wife, Ellen, may have been just fine if her husband had been the type to stay home and cater to her need for attention; but had Loomis had done that, we may well have lost the war. This is not an excuse for his behavior, but rather an explanation for it. All those involved managed to be hurt; not just two husbands and two wives, but their offspring and their friends who had to make a decision as to whose side they were goin to be on...and it led to much separation and much sadness. <br /> <br />An amazing man during an amazing time...I highly recommend this well-written biography! <br /> <br />Karen SAdler, <br />Science Education and Bioethics	2005-10-08

Robbs is a new author for me though I am familiar with both this pseudonym and her real author's name of Nora Roberts. In general I tend to stay away from mysteries that use rough language, and mysteries dependent upon sexual predators, and though there was both of these topics or tendencies in this book, I could barely put it down. It was extremely engrossing, and I find that many of my own opinions concerning those who were abused as children were mirrored by Robb/Roberts. Many people have existed through the history of the world who overcame horrendous abuse, and used their lives for good, so I have no pity for those who 'choose' (yes, 'choose') to become evil to fulfill some need in side of them to punish the person who hurt them in the first place. <br /> <br />Robb's characterization is not three dimensional in this book. You get a sense of Eve's, Roarke's, and their friends voice and mannerisms, but I found it hard to bring up a picture of the people themselves in these books. Maybe in some of the other ones that I intend to read. <br /> <br />With the latest natural disasters of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we saw newspaper articles released along with photographs of a 4000 pound alligator who had been shot in the streets of New Orleans, as he feasted on the dead and unwary. I have always loved animals, even most predators like the big cats, but there were a few animals that I would gladly rid the world of because they are nothing but lean, mean, eating machines. Alligators and Sharks are some of them. I told my husband they should give the military freedom to shoot every alligator in sight down there...I would not care. Another predator would take it's place in the environment. To a good extent I feel the same way about rapists, child molestors, and serial murderers. The loss of any form of responsibility, compassion for others, and no purpose to life but to rid themselves of that person (or ones like him or her( who impacted their lives so horribly) leaves society with little choice but to lock these killing machines away and throw away the key (especially since the liberals refuse to allow the death penalty to be practiced. Better these guys, then the innocent who just happened to be seen through their crosshairs! <br /> <br />Karen sadler	2005-10-04

Kathy Reichs writes relatively intelligent books, given her field of training is as a forensic anthropologist. I was a bit chagrined to see they attempted this year to turn this series into a television series. In doing so, they deleted some of the most interesting parts of her books, the relationships between her work down here in the states and her work in Canada.  <br /> <br />In this book the decisions that people make, including Tempe's own nephew, impacts greatly the lives of other people. A child gets in the way of a war between bikers and is shot; Tempe gets involved perhaps where she shouldn't be involved and that has an impact on her beloved mentor in Canada; information spread about her boyfriend impacts Tempe, only for her to find out it is not true. This concept of free will impacting the free will of others is one that needs to be more frequently talked about with adolescents, as they too often live in the moment...thinking that just 'one time' is not going to have a life-long impact...but that isn't true. I've seen it happen too often in my family and in the friends of my family and their children to know that just one drink when you are pregnant can severely impact your baby (spina bifada); just one try on a specific drug for someone with an addictive personality can lead to a lifetime of addiction. It always has an impact. <br /> <br />Reich's writing is good as usual. I hate to see this series ruined by television...not sure I will watch the show when I enjoy the books. <br /> <br />Karen SAdler	2005-09-27

Ok, this was one very major depressing mystery. I realize the fact that mysteries and uplifting are not two words you usually see together, but this book was so dark. Part of it was the time setting of winter, but everything and everybody in this book seems to be suffering from some type of bleakness bug! <br /> <br />This book was an introduction for me to Spencer-Flemings books. She's an excellent writer, and wrote well enough that her tendency to go between the past and the present did not bother me or make me lose my place. Her major characters are a female priest and a male cop who live in the same town, and get involved in the same cases. In this case, a local free clinic is losing it's funding due to the fact the church needs a new roof, and the deliverance of this bad news to the doctor in charge of the clinic leads to his disappearance.  <br /> <br />From the beginning it is obvious that the money that paid for the free clinic came with more that just a charitable thought. The money is tainted by the source from which it came, in which four children died of diptheria died during the depression, partly due to fear of the vaccines, and partly due to a family's need to offer their barn as a refuge for those who sold bootleg whiskey during the Prohibition. <br /> <br />The book was fascinating to me on a couple of fronts. Number one, is this is the second book I've come across concerning diptheria. It was a very nasty illness, and how thankful I am my children were vaccinated for it. The research done by the priest and others looking back into geneaology raises old stories and old questions, which happens all the time when doing real geneaology for your own family. Part of what makes it so interesting.  <br /> <br />The old ladies who write on a piece of paper on the back of this book for the library on whether they liked the book or not showed their colors when they stated \\"What kind of a minister is this?\\" A more modern one I am afraid. But then we don't knowof all the sins that previous churchmen were guilty of, and of course, 'judge not, that ye be not judged...' <br /> <br />Good book, just depressing. <br /> <br />Karen sAdler	2005-09-27

I have long loved quotes and especially quotes from Einstein, becaues like many great men, he did not think solely in one area on science. He thought greatly about many things. that doesn't mean that he was a perfect man. Far from it. He had major problems with personal relationships, was lacking in parenting skills, was very often not a great husband. Yet he tried to his utmost to use his immense intelligence to the good of mankind. I think he found it easier to deal with humans on a group basis, rather than an individual one. That does not mean that he did not leave an immense area of thought from which we can learn and put into use in our own lives. <br /> <br />Calaprice does a great job of sorting through the many quotes that were attributed to Einstein, but were not actually his. HOw best to get your ideas into print than to state they were words from the premier physicist and statesman of his time. I've seen some I often wondered about and shall have to change the way my mind memorized these statements (they are still often quite good statements).  <br /> <br />It does not surprise me to see how greatly, especially in areas such as religion that Einstein changed his views: especially in organized religion. But his basics remained the same. That man and woman can work in science and other fields to achieve greatness, and that greatness can be used for good or for evil. As with the discovery of fission of the atom, it is evident that we decide our own fate, and that that decision is made on an individual basis. <br /> <br />Sometimes, when I am overwhelmed with work, or just life in general, I like to go get this quote book and randomly read through Einstein's thinking process. I don't always agree with, but he always makes me think. I cannot think of a better book to get on this anniversery of his life and death. <br /> <br />Karen Sadler, <br />Science Education, <br />University of Pittsburgh, <br />Chemistry, <br />CCAC	2005-09-18

For those who are just now studying the history of Europe in the last mid-century, this all-embracing book on the impact of Nazi planning on all children may be a good place to start. For someone like me who has been reading about this stuff for about five years now (since being introduced to the medical ethics of Nazi use of children in medical school), this book tended to be an adequate rehash of a lot of information I had been introduced to in other books. Those books such as 'When Medicine Went Mad' by Caplan, the Nazi Doctors and the Nuremberg Code, 'Crying Hands', \\"The Origins of Nazi Genocide\\" by Henry Friedlander...and many, many more, this book did not contain enough new information, or provide new philosophical or ethical or moral input into this awful time in our human history to be worth the read.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book as a place to start, but there is so much out there that is so much better. Stories of real life poignantly written, information concerning those who sacrificed to save the lives of others...that this book becomes merely a listing of all the atrocities children went through throughout the world in a rather mindless way. <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2005-09-12

Actually, this stunt (putting a person's obit in before their death) sounds a little more on the college-age level than on high-school age level. And if it was done giving someone a great obit for being a great person, it could have been complimentary. But everyone who has read Brown's books, knows that when something like this happens, a body is sure to follow...and Harry is sure to follow the body to where it leads her; whether or not it is her business. <br /> <br />My animals roll their eyes at things I do too, so I am sure they don't think my IQ is very high in certain area. They are also prone to charge across my table when it is spread with homework from my chemistry students or papers I am referencing...leading to considerable time spent putting the papers back in order. They amuse me, and I feed them. That's the deal. They also answer the door for the deaf person...me. <br /> <br />I love Brown's descriptions of her characters and the area in Virginia. Under normal circumstances I would love to live in an area like Crozet, though I'd be more in Harry's financial circumstances. Unfortunately, the occurrence of murder in Crozet happens a little to often for my taste (come to think about it, there are a few areas around Pittsburgh where murders are happening too often too now, but the means and motive differ considerably). <br /> <br />Harry and her animals, and her friends make for great light reading. The writing is intelligent, you learn something new everytime, and the characterization is wonderful. And unlike other mystery writers at this time, Brown does not feel the need to fill her books with bad language and sex. A lot of that stuff can be implied without having to resort to cluttering up the readers' mind with trash... <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2005-09-10
74569:US	53067930	RIWZJZKMR4OZR	0806521392	947040144	The Scientific 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Scientists, Past and Present	Books	4	5	6	N	N	A 'must-have' book on shelves of teachers of science!	I had to put off reading this book until the summer because under normal conditions a person would pick this book up and look for a specific scientist, or science, and then get the wanted information on those specifics. This is not one of those books that you just pick up and read straight through. Most scientists are interested in a limited area of science. For example, Marie Curie was a chemist, a physicist, and interested in other sciences and the math that were involved in those sciences. Very rarely, if ever, did she wander into the domain of biological sciences (if she had, she may have been a bit more careful with the radium she and her husband were 'pocketing' on a daily basis)! <br /> <br />There are always a few men and women out there who remain curious about the entire world. Men like Leonardo de Vinci, Linus Pauling, even those outside of the world of science such as Thomas Jefferson. But the fact remains that this book would be used as a starting point or a reference by teachers and students to gain information about specific scientists and the fields they investigated; whether it be chemistry, physics, biology, or linguistics. <br /> <br />This is an excellent reference book. I can highly recommend it for use by teachers in gathering information about these famous men without going into so much detail about their scientific interests that the teachers who have not been trained in these areas, get lost. I especially recommend it for highschool and college level reference. If teachers of lower grades plan to use this book, I highly suggest they read carefully the information on specific scientists first rather than just handing the book over to a student. I am a little leery of recommending books that I have not read, or of teachers who recommend books that they have not read. The reason for this hesitation is that Simmons puts a small amount of personal information concerning these men and their families, especially their wives, in the chapters...and some of this information is not only not pertinent to their lives in science, but is actually slightly more detailed about their sex lives than a seventh grader needs to know. This is the only reason I gave the book a 4 star rating rather than a 5 star rating. <br /> <br />Otherwise, I enjoyed reading about so many interesting men and women (again, there is a limit on the amount of women and minorities in the book but that is in large  part due to historical prejudices which were not overcome until the last century). There are definitely several scientists I am going to read more information on because of this book raising my interest in them.  <br /> <br />Again, a highly informative reference book for science, math, and libraries. <br /> <br />Karen Sadler, <br />Science Education	2005-09-04

I thought this book was literally 'made or written for me' since I work in a bioethics/disability group that deals with some of the more recent moral conundrums brought to the fore by biomedical practitioners. Usually we have a problem in that families want to euthanize their family member with a disability. It never occurred to me that DNA testing could show that one parent is not actually the parent of a disabled child! And then to have invasive surgery to keep from passing on the defective gene to more posterity...I really think the woman should have mentioned this before the 'father' had the surgery. Would have avoided all kinds of trouble... <br /> <br />I was in London about 20 years ago, and though I saw one of their famous mazes I never got the opportunity to lose myself in one of them. I would have liked that as a child, though I imagine it can get a bit claustrophobic. Poor Inspector Sloan seems to have a knack for having to deal with bored elderly in Britain...their boredom is usually relieved by sticking their noses where into his murder cases. Though in this case the woman could hardly avoid getting involved since it was her maze the woman was killed in, and she had a bird's eye view of the maze from the second story of her home. She is actually quite witty, and keeps Sloan on his toes trying to figure out how to get through the maze, and how the body of the young woman got into the maze with no obvious tracks or means of doing so.  <br /> <br />Sloan continues to have to deal with his rather dense Constable who has a penchant for speed. And in the midst of all this is a small boy suffering from a genetic disorder, who in the end is left bearing all the suffering that the  selfishness of the adults around him left him with. A truly sad possibility to our endeavors to learn more about our existence and the sciences involved in making us who we are.  <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2005-08-24

I just realized that selling a house in Harry's hometown of Crozet would be very hard to do given the amount of people who manage to get themselves killed there. Maybe the residents hold grudges a bit more than most, or maybe the area just seems to attract irritating people. I have to admit, many of the people who get killed there would drive me batty, but resorting to murder seems a little over the line answer to the problems. <br /> <br />Anyhow, having two cats and a dog myself, I can testify to their general nosiness and their tendency to get 'into' things you don't want them to get into. Over the years I've come to realize that scientists are definitely wrong about a lot of things concerning animals and their abilty to understand. When I was growing up I remember a rather famous scientist stating that animals don't 'play' and we should stop anthromorphizing them (meaning: don't give them human characteristics). Since then, I've seen significant amount of evidence that animals do 'play', and do many other things we don't understand. I won't go so far as to give them the ability to solve crime...but I am willing to suspend judgement so I can enjoy Brown's books. <br /> <br />Part of the reason Brown's books are enjoyable is the fact that she characterizes well. It would be lovely if we could all live in small towns where people really know each other and their quirks. But the reality is that most of us don't stop to take the time to get to know people and enjoy them, as well as the animals around us. <br /> <br />Harry always manages to be involved some way or another in these crimes. In this case the guy who was sitting behind her during Crozet's beloved basketball games, manages to keel over in the parking lot. Harry is nosy and very observant, and not only does she notice a needle-sized hole in the man's neck, she feels something 'whoosh' past her during the game. Funny thing is that, Brown never seems to go back to that particular clue...I kept waiting for itand it never was mentioned again (the 'whooshing'), though the cops and Harry did manage to figure out how the poison was administered to the man without leaving a needle or some other trace. <br /> <br />Other than that, this was typical fun with Harry and her beloved animals, who she can't live without. I know the feeling. My house will never be free of animal life completely while I have any say in it...much to the chagrin of my very neat mother! <br /> <br />Karen sAdler	2005-08-24

This book caught my eye while browsing, and I do not regret taking the time to read this. Unlike situations like the Titanic, where the arrogance of men put thousands of people in danger, the men on the SS Badger State, a merchant marine ship used by our military to deliver ammo to those fighting the Vietnam War...these men were the victims of the weather and of those who loaded bombs and equipment on this ship. These men more than did their duty, yet all too often these are the very men who are passed over and their families neglected especially when they gave their lives in a war that still brings up mixed feelings. It doesn't matter what we as civilians or as military feel about that war and its consequences. What matters is that these men be recognized for the service they gave our country. It's to easy to dismiss these incidents as 'accidents' or as occurences that should be expected during times of war. These men did not sign up for the military, in fact, many of them had already served their country in the Korean War. These men were trying to make a living for themselves and their families, and continued to serve their country by being in the merchant marines...they did not count on having to carry armaments (and badly loaded ones at that), and deal with an unknown (the sea and the weather).<br /><br />We still cannot predict weather or what the oceans will do after another fifty years. We just barely are understanding the physics and mechanics of weather such as tornados and hurricanes, let alone back in 1969. I thought it a bit ironic that in the year we were celebrating the achievement of reaching the moon, we were still losing men to the same things down here.<br /><br />As with the Challenger, other space catastrophes, 9/11, etc. so many lives are lost because of ineptitude, because of sheer carelessness. In the case of the SS Badger State, the ship was loaded badly and inefficiently, yet no where in this book was any blame alloted to anyone. The captain had to sit by and watch more than half his crew drown due to that carelessness, but he held his blame for himself and for 'what ifs'.<br /><br />Not only were the men on the Badger outstanding for the work they tried to do in not only trying to save their ship but save the ammo loaded on that ship despite having little to work with in a sea that would not stop rolling, but also the Greek ship, Khian Star, went out of their way to rescue as many men as they could, putting at risk their own men for a war they were not involved it. This is simply courage at its best.<br /><br />I wish more of these stories involving courage, bravery, and integrity could be shared with our youth. They could see that these attributes come in many forms. Our young people need to have people they can look up to--not celebreties who are full of themselves, and who seem incapable of giving back to society. We need more heroes along this line, not people who are self-involved.<br /><br />Karen SAdleraptain had to sit by and watch more than half his crew drown due to that carelessness, but he held his blame for himself and for 'what ifs'. <br /> <br />Not only were the men on the Badger outstanding for the work they tried to do in not only trying to save their ship but save the ammo loaded on that ship despite having little to work with in a sea that would not stop rolling, but also the Greek ship, Khian Star, went out of their way to rescue as many men as they could, putting at risk their own men for a war they were not involved it.

I am kind of working my way back through Hillerman's books as there have been many that I have not read, and I forgot how much I enjoy his writing. Chee's newest deputy (and female interest) finds an overturned truck in the desert, and makes the wrong assumption that the dead person in the truck is just another drunken Indian who died in an alcohol-related traffic accident or from exposure due to drinking. Even members of our own 'communities' tend to be guilty of accepting the stereotypes given to us by society at large...and Bernie makes an erroneous assumption that could cost her her job. <br /> <br />Chee and Leaphorn become involved when this death is found to be tied in with a cold case that was never solved. A man is killed and his killer confesses to the crime. The killer's wife may or may not have been involved (this is never determined) but she is never seen again through all of Leaphorn's long career as a chief of the Navajo Tribal Police. When the connection between the dead man in the truck and the missing woman resurfaces, the killer is finally free after serving his lengthy sentence. And he wants Leaphorn to find his long lost wife. Leaphorn isn't sure whether this man is being truthful about his wife's disappearance, or whether he is merely trying to coverup another murder he has not been responsible for. <br /> <br />The legends and stories of the Indians in the Four Corners Area of the U.S. are numerous and intertwined, and they make for good reading. I've always been a fan of legends and myths. I think I read all the Greek, Roman, and Norse/Celtic myths by the time I was 16. So finding a writer like Hillerman who can weave in those myths and legends with current happenings and mysteries really fills the time I allot myself for enjoyable reading (versus reading done to do a paper or for classwork, or for bioethical work). <br /> <br />This is a deeply sad story...one that leaves all parties marked with sadness. It leaves the old killer with the recognition that his own selfishness and greediness, robbed him of the only thing worth anything in his life...and Leaphorn realizes this. Chee is forced to rethink his feelings towards his deputy, Bernie Manuelito...whether to treat her as his deputy or as a person, and what he needs to do to free himself of the predicament he finds himself in when he discovers he has feelings towards this young woman. Actually, the young woman is taught a means to fix the predicament for both of them by Lieutenant Leaphorn. <br /> <br />As usual, Hillermans paints the beauty of the area well, and his characterization is right on target. A truely enjoyable series of mysteries. I intend to go through every single on of his books this time! <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2005-08-01

I am always pleased to find new British mystery writers as they tend to write in a way that I can enjoy. As another reviewer stated, this book is very tongue-in-cheek, but it has to do with a topic I am currently involved in in bioethics; the concept of who controls when a person lives or dies. this is an ongoing argument at the moment. In the U.S. we tend to err on the side of caution, and feel that when a person's 'time' is up should be left to 'God' or 'fate.' In Europe, in Great Britain, and especially the Netherlands, this determination is being 'made' for people by their families or by society, who I don't feel has the right to make that type of judgement call.  <br /> <br />Sloan, a rather weary detective is called into a care facility because a woman dies. This elderly woman writes a letter and has someone on the staff mail this letter upon her death...and she out and out states that she has been murdered. Sloan, and his sidekick Crosby (who is a terrible driver!) never do determine whether this one woman was among those in this care facility whose time was determined for them by someone else, whether a family member anxious to get their paws on the family money, an over-zealous nurse or medical personnel on the staff, or some other person for some other reading. But basically the question is raised that no matter who determines when a person should live or die is a murderer. I am not sure that this is the wishful thinking of this reader or whether Aird (there is a Scottish name for you) herself feels this way towards those who would play the part of God. <br /> <br />The writing is concise and compact. Aird wastes no words and yet she manages to get in plenty of snide remarks. At some places you almost feel as if there should be a drum-roll for the crack being made. How nice to find a new and interesting British mystery writer! <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2005-08-01

I've read a few books about catastrophe, and I knew from the lack of pictures that this book was not about tornados, but rather about the diverse groups of people who chase tornados for a variety of reasons. There are the professional weather people who are trying to understand how this particular weather phenomenon works in the U.S. in order to be able to give people in the pathway of a tornado time enough to move either down (into a basement) or away from the area. There are the professional cameramen and women who stockpile photographs or films for use online, in books, on the various weather channels, etc. There are professors of weather in physics and their students who go on to become professional tornado chasers or meterologists for the numerous news stations across the country. There are those people who view tornados as a unique thing to visit because their own countries (like Britain) do not tend to get weather such as this due to geographic location. Then there are the nitwits who put themselves and everyone else at risk chasing these storms, just because they happen to be in fashion at the moment due to a variety of films and television shows. <br /> <br />From the couple of sections I read in the library before checking this book out, I could see the Svenvold was writing in a different matter than what I was introduced to in science and physics. It looked very interesting, and it proved to be so. Svenvold does an excellent job introducing the reader into this rarified world of chasers, with each chapter dealing with different groups in this phenomenon. Svenvold writes as if the reader were there and participating in the conversations being held by the various groups...even the ongoing arguments they are having about whether they provide or fill a niche.  <br /> <br />This book was about the people involved and not about tornados as a weather phenomena. If you go into reading this book with this knowledge you will not be disappointed. This is a differentsegment of society than most of us ever deal with (though almost all sciences have their mavericks), and because under normal circumstances I would never come into contact with these people, it was interesting to me for that reason. <br /> <br />Another reason this type of writing, or book is of interest to me, is as a deaf person who lives on the very borders of Tornado Alley (in Pittsburgh, PA we get microbursts more than tornados), I know from previous experience that those of us with hearing loss tend to be at risk from tornados and hurricanes. I've worked for years trying to draw attention to this problem within the professionals with little success and I wanted to understand why these guys do not understand that blowing a siren does not help those of us who cannot hear that siren or in many cases read the captioning that often is not provided on The WEather Channel or CNN. So there continue to be lawsuits filed on behalf of the deaf community until some changes are made to give 'us' more notification. <br /> <br />I thought Svenvold's writing was hilarious, his depiction of the people he came in contact with tended to border on cartoonish but then the behavior of these people tended to border on cartoonish. Svenvold obviously started out with the attitudes of many people who are interested in weather phenomena such as tornados, but towards the end began to question his own behavior or his own reasons for spending a spring with these people chasing possible sightings of tornados...he began to wonder, what am I doing here? Why am I putting at risk the father of two children and the husband responsible for a family. This is one case in which we can learn from the experience of another person, without having to go through those same experiencs. I can still be intrigued by tornados, but I see now that there are many out there recklessly chasing storms, and in so doing they trivialize the immense damage these storms take, and the human toll they take on society. Ipersonally will probably always be in awe of these storms, but I will enjoy the pictures of professionals and put no one at risk for all the wrong reasons by tagging along. <br /> <br />Contrary to other reviews I found Svenvold's writing to be interesting and dynamic. I think the readers will have to go through a chapter of this book on their own before they can determine whether this writing fulfills a need for them... <br /> <br />Karen Sadler, <br />Science Education	2005-08-01

I love the southwest having grown up in Salt Lake City, California, and visiting my grandparents in Mesa, Arizona. Hillerman has created his own unique genre...because there is no one who deals with Native americans and their own problems. This book especially was good because a few years ago they had many young people die from the Hantavirus (Hillerman adds the bubonic plague...but the Hantavirus is the main concern down there. With too much water, the pinion trees produce too muchand encourages the population growth of mice and rats who live under the homes of the Native Americans. When their fecal matter dries out, it aerosolizes and exposes the lungs to the virus in the fecal matter. the Center for Disease control had their hands full with that one. <br /> <br />Leaphorn and Chee are two diverse characters...each with their own flaws. Trying to be a cop down in that area must be very stressfull since they have to patrol large distances with huge problems, including being careful of the many diverse tribes with differnt religious beliefs and the need to honor those beliefs. <br /> <br />Hillerman knows the four corners area (Utah, arizona, colorado, and New Mexico) well. This particular story had to do with illegal poaching of eagles in that area, as well as people dying from exposure to a resistant strain of plague virusl. These guys are expected to be and do impossible things including deal with bodies that may have infectious disease in them and trying to get tribal permission to do autopsies, since most of the Navaho and Arapahos and Utes do not believe in desecrating the body of the deceased. <br /> <br />Interesting topic and a good read. <br />karen Sadler	2005-07-23
197912:US	53067930	R30GWR8M0ILQPQ	0060563443	124726879	Skeleton Man (Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee Novels)	Books	4	2	5	N	N	History + Mystery = Hillerman	I really enjoy Tony Hillerman's novels with Detective Leaphorn and his relunctant sidekick Chee. The novels teach so much concerning the Native American Indians of the 4 Corners Area...my grandfather worked down there quite a bit, and I learned to love that area when my grandparents moved down there. It is very beautiful, but stark... and we as Americans really need to know more about the people we moved in on. Hillerman never preaches, but he does recognize the need to introduce 'our' culture to 'their' culture...as he does so it becomes less strange. Education usually helps people to respect one another more. <br /> <br />The airline catastrophe that is the basis for this book happen a month and a half before I was born in Salt Lake City. I had never read or heard about this; like I said, my family lived in the area, traveled, saw the sights, I have current family in St. George, Utah...and my father-in-law knows a million off-the-road paths to the back part of the Grand Canyon. The accident description both in the book and on the Internet took my breath away, partly because it could have been avoided. The first flight I took at age 4/5 with my parents also almost ended in disaster because the plane's wheels refused to come down. I couldn't help but think about that plane trip. Things have changed a lot in the airplane industry for the better, and we have forgotten all the changes and blessings this has brought to us. <br /> <br />The story revolves around this nearly 50 year old accident that caused changes in flight rules and the development of the FAA. An obsessed woman is told she might be able to find something from that accident that will prove she is who she says she is. She wants this in order to seek revenge (long time to hold a grudge!) on her father's family lawyer who misused the family fortune through a phony charity.  <br /> <br />Since this happened over the Grand Canyon (Apparently people would ask the pilots to dip over it so they could see it), itultimately involves the various Indian tribes of that area. So Chee and Leaphorn get sucked into involvement with white people who are invading sacred religious areas of these tribes. A 'slow' Indian is accused of robbery and murder, and Chee needs to help his family by finding evidence that this man is telling the truth concerning a very good diamond that he supposedly 'was given' years ago by a hermit at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br />The story and characters are good as they usually are. I enjoyed the background story, both concerning the accident and the history of the canyon. <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2005-06-20

This book was fun because it was gross...some of the descriptions of the sailors suffering from scurvy were extremely disturbing. Since this was a major killer of sailors for centuries (wonder if the ancients had any problems with this), it is important to understand what scurvy does. Bown answered this question, and the question of who did the most to solve this puzzle. He never answered the medical question of how scurvy acts on the body or why Vitamin C acts the way it does in the body. I was hoping for a bit more information concerning the medical or bodily impact of lack of Vitamin C and fresh vegetables/fruits. <br /> <br />Like other reviewers stated, this book could have been deeper. I suspect (and I am sure I read somewhere) that scurvy affected Northern European people even on land because of lack of understanding of the need for fresh foods in the diet. Would have liked to have more information concerning this fact. <br /> <br />However, for the most part, this was an enjoyable piece of medical research history. In getting an individual book on a small piece of medical history, the reader gets more information and more specifics than if they read a more general medical history. This supplied a lot of information...and I wonder how they handle all these burials at sea in genealogical records. I'll bet with all the impressments of men to go to sea (meaning they scooped up and basically kidnapped the men they needed) there is a huge hole where these men should have been because families did not know where they were, and no records of their deaths at sea were kept. Must make it fun to do research for family records back in the 1600's thru the middle 1800's! <br /> <br />Karen Sadler, <br />Science Education, <br />University of Pittsburgh	2005-06-20
208702:US	53067930	R1NYG761LLYA9A	0399152113	729676939	Winter House (Kathleen Mallory Novels)	Books	5	8	13	N	N	Smart, savvy mysteries that require intelligent readers...	O'Connell never ceases to surprise me. She creates unusual characters in each of her books, with plots that require close reading in order to get everything she slips into the plotlines. Definitely psychologically driven writing. I particularly enjoy these books because of the amount of knowledge concerning the brain, and the impact of diverse upbringings beyond the norm. Her Kathy is beautiful, but seriously flawed in her relationships with other people...Kathy's admirers run the gamut of her foster father's old friends and an extremely bright younger man who feels he is too ugly to be loved. Definitely take Hans Christien Anderson's 'The Ugly Duckling' to a more modern extreme. <br /> <br />Her mysteries have a tendency to update the idea of human atrocities to other humans to an extreme. The thought that a person could go into a house and kill 9 human beings of different ages with no remorse, knowing the victims on a personal level, but being driven by a money motive is very vicious, very cold. It also makes me wonder how many other companies, corporations, lawyers, groups, etc. have performed acts of the same nature for the same motives. Using the concept of serial or mass murder for monetary gain is not new. The Italians Medici family did this on a regular basis back in the Middle Ages, and I'm sure it goes farther back when power is combined with money. But the concept of blaming it on a vulnerable child, who is left for the rest of their life being apologetic for something they did not do, and for being on the defensive for being exposed to something so atrocious, that they have to live with a weapon under their pillow for a feeling of safety is horrific. <br /> <br />What's even scarier is the degree to which Kathy Mallory sympathizes with the supposed killer, probably because she senses immediately something is wrong with the picture...and senses a frame-up job. Yet, because Kathy cannot seem to talk to her best friends and business acquaintances, Riker andCharles Butler, they all misunderstand one another until it's too late to save the life of the one person worth saving in this group...even if they did succeed in saving the person's psychological make-up by exposing the fact that she could not possibly have been responsible for this crime.  <br /> <br />I keep thinking Kathy is going to mature at some point psychologically, especially with so many who support and understand her vulnerability as a child impacted her abilities as an adult for both good and bad. She has yet to show much maturity, though she made some strides in physical closeness in this novel. <br /> <br />As always, I hope this bright writer doesn't given any vicious minds new ideas...we have enough psychological misfits in our society as it is; we don't need more. <br /> <br />Writing is mesmerizing as per usual...less than 2-day summer book, but requires time to assimulate and classify all the information given. <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2005-06-10
216404:US	53067930	R2IJNSFBB0LXLB	1585747505	877769120	Assault In Norway: Sabotaging the Nazi Nuclear Program	Books	5	52	56	N	Y	Heroics in the highest sense of the word!	While teaching chemistry this year, I came across the word deuterium, which stands for what is called 'heavy water.' I was browsing around looking for more information on the difference between regular hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium, for my class...as I have found that the more history given in chemistry classes, the more the students are likely to remember technical information if they understand what it was used for. <br /> <br />During WWII there was a perceived race between the Allies and Germany to be the first to come up with an atomic bomb. The Allies were right to be worried because most of the work on nuclear energy had been done in Germany prior to the war, by people like Einstein and Fermi. These men were quickly moved out of Germany, and into Britain and the U.S., as their minds were worth their weight in gold.  <br /> <br />One of the ways to cause a nuclear reaction is to use heavy water. Hydrogen under normal conditions has a proton and an electron, but no neutron within its nucleus. In order to start a nuclear reaction, a nucleus has to bombard uranium or plutonium, and regular water cannot supply that neutron. Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen that has a neutron in its nucleus, and so can start a reaction. <br /> <br />The Germans did not have access to heavy water, and this was part of the reason that they invaded Norway early, as Norway had an outstanding heavy water facility. Those involved in the production of the atomic bomb in this country were very concerned that the Nazis were about 2 years ahead of us in creating a bomb. This threat was enough to be of importance to Franklin Deleanor Roosevelt and winston Churchill, and to General Groves who was the military arm of the Los Alamos group creating the bomb in the U.S. Groves made it clear that the Norsk Hydra plant needed to be taken out of commission immediately. <br /> <br />Both British and Norwegian loyalists were involved in this joint effort. Luckily the men who created the Norsk plant were in England and could give detailed instruction to the men who were to sabotage the plant. the first attempt at gliding British into Norway ended in disaster, when the gliders crashed, and those who survived the crash were murdered by the  <br />Germans. The second attempt, made up of all Norwegians, was more successful, and they not only blew up important parts of the plant, but made it home to Britain in safety. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the Germans were able to get the plant up and running sooner than expected, and were sending heavy water to Germany for safekeeping. This meant that another sabotage needed to be planned, one that would sink the barrels of heavy water in the deep part of a fjord. and this time the lives of innocent Norwegians were lost as they could not take the chance of alerting civilians and having the Germans suspect something. <br /> <br />I wish the book had explained more about the chemistry of the heavy water, but the book was an enjoyable historical read, as so much of the information came first hand from those Norwegians involved. I found enough information on the Internet to explain the process using heavy water, and it is still used today in Canada. <br /> <br />The Norwegians should be proud of the part they played in defeating the Germans...as someone of Norwegian ancestry, I am proud of what they sacrificed. <br /> <br />Karen Sadler, <br />Science Education	2005-06-04
216751:US	53067930	R1CDTPW4NO2E0F	0312289723	1827617	Ten Big Ones (Stephanie Plum Novels)	Books	4	3	5	N	N	I got a huge kick out of this one...	The plotting was typical for this type of mystery, but the humor was the type to make me snort with laughter. Usually, I am not crazy about mysteries that have an overabundance of bad language in it, but the idea of a bus driver trying to overcome his use of bad language in front of the kids by snapping a rubber band on his wrist was funny. Especially, since he had a major difficulty overcoming his propensity for foulmouthedness. I can just imagine how red his wrists must have been. <br /> <br />Stephanie Plum manages to get herself into and out of trouble all by herself. To add to this, she can't make up her mind about the two men in her life. She gets very prickly when they try to tell her what to do, but she would be equally annoyed if they didn't show that they cared. <br /> <br />Stephanie has managed to get herself on a hit list, and for a while there, it is not a sure thing...but rather a rumor. Enough of one to make her nervous. On top of that she has to deal with a neurotic family, a coworker who has her own strange sense of humor and right and wrong.  <br /> <br />An enjoyable read...I'll be looking for more of her books that I've managed to miss. <br /> <br />Karen L. sadler	2005-06-04
221424:US	53067930	R3JYTRLCUWTZ5A	0060520752	502448572	The Children's Blizzard	Books	5	31	34	N	N	a book to make you count your blessings!	This book was a traumatic read for me for several reasons. First off, my family is from Norway and some of them came over to the United States at this time period and at the turn of the century. They came for the same reasons that Laskin mentioned in his book: Norway is gorgeous, but it's lands were being used without the knowledge we have today of the need to replenish and rest the land. My ancestors came because of the promise of jobs, and of freedom, and of better lives for their children. <br /> <br />The fact that so many children were caught in this unexpected blizzard is the other reason this was hard for me to read. All of those mothers who have children and grandchildren, can place themselves in the place of the mothers whose children were lost in this very strange storm. I cannot imagine the agony of these mothers, and of the teachers who did what they thought was best for the children. It's easy in hindsight to say that the teachers should have done 'this', and that the weather forecasters were lax in their jobs...but so little was known not just of the vagaries of weather in that part of the United States, but how to get this information to those who needed it most. Even had the weather forecasters predicted this storm 24 hours before it happened, the chances that it would have reached the towns and individuals on the Dakota praries in time to prevent the deaths were slim at best. <br /> <br />I read this book in less than two days, and I found it as mesmerizing as \\"Issac's Storm\\", which I also read years ago. Perhaps it's because my own family were Norwegian and pioneers, though I don't think they were caught in this as they settled in Minnesota and Illinois and Utah.  <br /> <br />There was one light note in this book that cracked me up. Laskin talked about the boys in one town who had a new and rather inept teacher. These boys would read far ahead of the teacher in their books, and then stump him with questions he did not know the answers too. Laskinalso stated that many unaware teachers got literally picked up by the bigger boys and deposited outside the schoolhouse, which those boys then locked. Laskin said occasionally the schoolchildren had to be smoked out (by blocking the chimney). Since my great-great aunts (3) were teachers and one was a principal in Illinois this made me curious as to whether they experienced any of these stunts. Will have to check the geneaology. <br /> <br />This was a good book, a very poignant one. I wish Laskin had been able to include more writings of the pioneers who lived through this, though I am sure more of them would have broken my heart. We are so lucky to live in a day and age where our children are mostly safe from weather and disease through vaccines. It's only human predators we have to watch for now. <br /> <br />Karen L.

231783:US	53067930	R2MZ5IV4VT7AK6	B0002D6DC4	704157984	Of Moths and Men: An Evolutionary Tale	Books	3	6	15	N	N	Interesting subject in boring science area still boring...	I really wanted to read this book. Even had my sister get it for me as a gift. It was a huge disappointment. It was not the subject matter. It was the way the book was written. Over the last 7 years I've read a lot of science books on different topics from a lot of authors. You can tell when someone has written science in such a way that people outside that science, not only can understand it, but get involved in it. Some people call that the 'watering down of science.' But science was never intended to be for the elite, though some promoted it that way...and for years it stayed that way through fostering 'old men's clubs' and excluding anyone different. <br /> <br />Evolutionary science is not easy, but other authors have made it very interesting. Entymology (study of bugs) tends to be the domain of rarified geeks...yet I've read books on forensic entymology that were absolutely spell-binding (if a bit on the gross side). <br /> <br />This book could have been either of the above, or both of the above types of books, but ended up being neither. It's decent but plodding writing. Okay reseach, but nothing brilliant and nothing that stands out. I realize this is a story that needed to be told, and probably needs to be retold in textbooks because so many mistakes were make; but you get the feeling it could have been done in an article in journals.  <br /> <br />I've read about science gone awry for years. If the book is well-written the reader, especially the reader who is in science, comes away passionately bothered and wanting to change this continuing system that allows poor science to be passed as theory and more. This book elicited more of a sigh, and a trip to the local library... <br /> <br />Karen Sadler, <br />Science Education, <br />University of Pittsburgh	2005-05-22
232077:US	53067930	R2V7MOXZ57N300	0393051374	506539420	Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie (Great Discoveries)	Books	5	11	23	N	Y	Wonderful, intelligent biography of great, but flawed person	Hmm...usually I don't particularly like my biographers and history writers to go into their books with an agenda. It's hard for people to look at history from an unbiased viewpoint...I found that out when I started doing research on those with disabilities being sterilized because of eugenic fervor. <br /> <br />Goldsmith can hardly be said to be unbiased. She is a known author of feminist tracts. That having been said, it should also be known that she is an excellent writer. The big problem is like all good writers, she raises more questions than she solves (though she did answer some personal questions I had about Marie Curie). <br /> <br />As someone who tried to get through a neuroscience program in a medical school where I was most definitely not wanted (Deaf, had interpreters in tow, older, and a woman in a white, male, young field), I can certainly commiserate with Curie, though I did not go through half of her pain. I had a wonderful childhood with great parents, which prepared me for what was coming. My depressions during 'battles' with professors and administrators were nothing compared to Marie Curie's, though they continue to practice discrimination in almost all fields of science to this day for all of the reasons above (and against racial minorities, of which I am not...but had friends who were). My husband continues to support me, and I've developed a group of friends, interpreters, and others who have supported as much as they can. It makes it easier to find people like you with computer access which Curie didn't have. <br /> <br />I find it difficult to be mad at her or pass judgements on her faults. She was not a good mother, but given what she had as a mother...that can be understood. I think I had read a long time ago about her possible involvement with another man after Pierre's death...but of course, that has nothing to do with her work or even her character; as I suspect she reached out to this man who was so much less than she and Pierre outof sheer loneliness and desperation. Everyone makes mistakes...very few people reach over the abyss of discrimination and intolerance to grab bits of knowledge that will benefit mankind...even if that mankind may not be ready or worthy of the effort to get that knowledge. <br /> <br />A good biography, with a bit of a feminist bent. These women became feminists whether they wanted to or not, because society forced them to become that way. In order to achieve greatness, sometimes women (and men) are forced to go around or go through the very societal mores that would stop them. Our world would never change, and we would never learn and conquer our fears and the very things that threaten our lives unless these people put forth this effort. <br /> <br />Like Madame Curie, I am of the opinion that knowledge is given to us. It is up to us to decide how we are going to use that knowledge. All new information has a good side and a bad side to it; as demonstrated with nuclear energy. On one side is the possible clean use of energy, and on the other is the annihilation of this world as we know it. <br /> <br />Karen Sadler, <br />Science Education, <br />University of Pittsburgh, <br />Chemistry, <br />CCAC	2005-05-22

I read Barry's book on influenza, and was impressed with his writing and his historical research. Warning! This book is not for the faint of heart historical buff, or for anyone who wants to hear only the good side of American life and history. They are not going to find it in this book.  <br /> <br />In some ways, the book is about as big as the Mississippi. It goes on and on...not that that's bad. It depends on the outlook of the reader of history. If you want all the information, going back over 100 years of history in order to understand what led up to making of levees-only policy on the river (and on other American rivers as well), then coming to Barry is the right place. I learned in reading his book on influenza that he has a tendency to go WAY BACK. I got derailed a couple of times on this book, but as with his other writings, once you get into two or three chapters, Barry's historical research and his writing gets the reader hooked. <br /> <br />This was a part of history I don't remember. I thought I got a lot of American history, but now I am afraid I just have small parts of it and a lot of the history I got was not on a national bent, but rather state or local. So what happened in the South during this time period from after the Civil War until the Great Depression got bypassed as it had not impacted those of us who lived in the West.  <br /> <br />Barry made up for a lot of never received information. I remember not thinking much of President Hoover, but in this book he comes across as one of our most unethical presidents, as well as a typical politician. I was completely disgusted with the treatment of African-Americans by not only the politicians, the National Guard, but the Red Cross. The National Red Cross owes a huge apology to the surviving families of so many African-Americans because of their unequal treatment in a disaster situation. And Hoover, made promises he never intended to keep...sound familiar? <br /> <br />Barry is a thorough writer,and at times a very engrossing writer. When he is at his peak, his handling of history definitely engages the reader. I learned a lot more from this book on the South and race and politics, than I ever learned in school. Unfortunately, what Barry states concerning the deep South and New Orleans only confirms what I've said to my husband for years. I never want to visit that area in my life...even as a tourist. There is nothing noble or good about the history of that area; nothing that I want to see or experience. Barry demonstrates that the history of New Orleans, their attitude towards others who are different or poor or less advantaged, their quick fix to blow a levee and devastate an entire district and 2 parishes and then reneging on their promise to pay those people for the loss of their homes and businesses...ugh. What a disgusting group of people...they are to blame for their own society's collapse because of their utter selfishness. <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2005-05-19

We reviewers don't know what it's like to have to come up with new ideas for books over such a long period of time. It's very easy for us to criticize. I wanted to make sure to put my two cents of 'opinion' in here and say to other mystery readers, this is not a bad book for summer reading.  <br /> <br />I read a lot of science and history, and every once in a while I need a mystery to break up the serious reading I do. I tend to gravitate towards authors that I am familiar with since every time I try a new fiction author, I get something with either bad language, bad plotting, bad violence...too much sex or all of the above. We have limited brain capacity (from my years in neuroscience), and I choose not to fill it up with someone else's crap!  <br /> <br />Grafton has usually been a good writer, avoiding all of the above plagues for the most part as an author. Occasionally her plotting isn't the best, but this particular book about her protagonist having to babysit a released convict for her aging father, was actually quite good. I liked the characterization in this one. I've always liked the fact that Grafton includes a family of elderly men who are very lively...they make for interesting subplots.  <br /> <br />Fun read, fast read! <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2005-05-18

I've read several of Preston's books, especially with his co-write Lincoln Child (I think) it is.I thoroughly enjoyed those books. They are smart, funny, treat the reader as half-way intelligent, involve museums, art, and a very odd character, AGent Pendergast...who I happen to like. This book strives to attain to those previous books, but doesn't quite get there. The plot is interesting, even though we've known about tropical forest fauna and flora being useful for medications for some time, and hence the current razing of the Amazonian and Central American forests are of much concern. Mixing this with an old man trying to press his personality on his sons via a massive Mayan burial...well, it's unique. <br /> <br />The whole thing didn't flow as easily as Preston's books usually do. It seemed contrived and a bit stilted. I can't quite place my hand on what the problem was. Maybe the book started out bigger with more explanation, and less assumptions, and Preston was told to edit it down. I would rather read a bigger book, with better plotting and characterization, than a short one that ends up being less than what we expect from this particular writer.  <br /> <br />Not a bad book, just not his best. <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2005-04-27

This particular poem is my favorite Robert Frost poem, and is one of my top five favorite poems. I was hoping that this book would portray the simple beauty and nuances of this poem, to read to my granddaughter. It more than met my expectations. Even my husband, who is a photographer and who doesn't read as much as I do, found the artwork in this book to convey beautifully the words of Frost's poem.  <br /> <br />This poem was not intended for children, and has many facets to it. But good poetry must be taught and appreciated early, and this book will help parents and teachers to show appreciation for poetry. If it doesn't start with the parents and teachers, then the children are never exposed to it.  <br /> <br />Whenever I read this poem, and now this book, it conveys a sense of peace, a sense of being quiet, of learning to look for the beauty in the world around you. This should be a classic. <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2005-04-21

I spent half my time reading this book shaking my head. Even my husband asked what was wrong. It's simply incredible that even this far back in medical history, the mid-1800s, that an actual advance could cause as much trouble as it did. This story is about three men; one discovered the ability of certain chemicals to cause people to become oblivious to pain, one man found the best chemical and the right means to deliver it--but his reputation as a con artist proved to be his undoing for something he actually did right, and the last man was a doctor on the peripherary of all this who sought to claim more credit for something he had little to do with. <br /> <br />I thought I was cynical before, because of all the problems we are having with pharmaceutical companies placing profits above health, and physicians and researchers following suit...but apparently, this has been a problem for over a hundred and fifty years. <br /> <br />The major 'discoverer' of etherization as an anasthetic for surgery, Morton, actually followed through and experimented with the formulas to get the right amount to allow patients to sleep through horrific surgery such as amputation. However, Morton's previous life as a con artist and also his rush to place a patent on this technique for profit reasons, caused his discovery to backfire against him. Not only did he never receive recompense for his work in this area, even the military absconded and used his work during the Civil War. The poor man died in despair in his mid-40s, with little recognition paid until after his death. <br /> <br />None of the men received what they thought was their rightful due concerning ether use in surgery. One committed suicide, and the last man who was a very intelligent man ended up dying slowly in an insane asylum of most probably a stroke, that may have incapacitated his ability to speak, but not necessarily his memory or thinking abilites.  <br /> <br />This is one of the worse case scenarios of the attempt to profit off of the pain of others. I felt remorse for all of these men and their families; yet at the same time, if they had handled it differently with less eagerness to make a profit or be the 'one' whose name was attached with etherization, maybe it would have worked out better. <br /> <br />Well-written and interesting book. It's amazing after 150 years we still don't understand how anasthetia (sic) works. I think it would be more helpful to designing specific methods for individuals if we did understand it more.  <br /> <br />Karen Sadler, <br />Science Education	2005-04-20
276465:US	53067930	RYNHMK5O4IVT6	0471330132	381398374	Foundations of College Chemistry	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Thank heavens for a decent college chem book!	I got asked to teach chemistry very spur of the moment at our local community college. First class was a chemistry lab, for which I didn't need a chemistry book. Then two weeks later they asked me to take a chemistry class for nursing majors and handed me this absolutely awful textbook. Not only was it not well-written, the set-up for the chapters was screwy, and both the students and I found numerous mistakes in the problems and I found more on the CD-rom they gave me for testing. Geez...proofreaders needed badly! <br /> <br />I asked around the campus from the other chemistry professors and this book was the one most highly recommended. I could not ask the students to purchase a new book in the middle of the semester, but I can assure you I am using this book to double-check and back-up everything in the other chemistry book.  <br /> <br />As a deaf person who is perfectly capable of teaching hearing students, and someone who has done a lot of research into learning per se...I find it a bit ludicrous that textbook writers don't seem to understand some very basic concepts. Number 1, it's been shown that deaf students do much better with visual input of any kind (not text, pictures, graphs, photos, etc.). It's also been found that hearing students do much better when given that same visual information, rather than merely lecture or text. Now why would that be any different for older students? My students in both classrooms prefer to have visual representations of what they are being taught. That's one great thing about this book...lots of great pictures. And what they don't have, I can certainly find on the Internet. <br /> <br />For example, the other textbook talked in text about nicotine. It wasn't very interesting. So I went and got more info about nicotine as a chemical off of the Internet, including very gross pictures of what nicotine does to the lungs. That certainly got the attention of these students who are going into nursing or other medical endeavors. Ialso told them about there being two types of receptors in neurons (my specialty); nicotinic and muscarinic, and explained what hitting the nicotinic receptors constantly with smoking or second-hand smoke would do.  <br /> <br />The sciences do not exist in a vaccuum. Chemistry applies to almost all other sciences, and chemistry does not need to be boring. This book by Hein and Arena is certainly not boring, and a much better book than the one I was originally given. I have been asked back to teach again, and this will be the book I recommend. <br /> <br />Karen Sadler <br />Science Education	2005-04-15

I can say that, because all of these feuds involved men, except for one concerning Rosalind Franklin and the DNA fiasco...with one of my least favorite scientists, Watson.  <br />It never ceases to amaze me the amount of ego that gets involved in scientific and medical discoveries. It's humongous! Fights concerning rights of discoveries or inventions, fights concerning doing the right thing for the patient (rather than the doctor), etc. have existed since the beginning of time and are continuing today. The very last section of the book had to do with the discovery of the AIDS virus by Gallo (American) and Montagnier (French). <br /> <br />Some of the earlier feuds had to do with the discovery of how the body really works through doing dissections of both animals and human cadavers. This was frowned upon by the Church, which basically ran society during the middle ages and into the Renaissance, but some brave men like Harvey and Di Vinci went ahead and did what needed to be done. So when they actually published their findings, all hell often broke lose. This often put these physicians and scientists at risk for life, but their refusal to rely on ancient theories from Galen is what paved the way for modern medicine. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the way Hellman writes. He's a little bit of of a cynic and smart aleck, just my type...since I'm that way myself. The information is concise and interesting. I knew about some of the fights from previous medical histories, but Hellman often gave information that wasn't available in these books. The story concerning Semmelweis who discovered the real reasons behind women dying in childbirth from pueperal fever (exhange of germs from cadavers to women in labor by doctors not cleaning up prior to touching those women) is probably one of the saddest stories I have ever read, especially since he ended up being brutalized in an insane asylum, and it killed him at an early age.  <br /> <br />This should be on a list of required readings for medical and research students. Perhaps if more of them realized how ridiculous these spats are, especially if they involve ego and money (which is a current huge problem thanks to the pharmaceutical companies and kickbacks to physicians), they would learn to allow ethics to govern more of their behavior.  <br /> <br />People who enjoy medical history, and teachers can use this book to interest students in medicine and research, because these are areas of a good percent of the jobs today. <br /> <br />Karen Sadler <br />Science Education <br />	2005-04-15

I enjoyed getting this book for my classes. It's a visual map of medicine from the beginning of time (homo sapien's time). There was some information in there that was new to me, but most of it is stuff I already knew. It's the presentation that is great to show students when things occurred and why, especially in terms of changes in society. This book makes it clear that medical changes in preserving life and actually curing disease, was dependent upon the different sciences making progress in each individual field. Then those changes could be incorporated into medicine.  <br /> <br />An example of this, is the development of microscopes during the Enlightenment Era, and increasing better optics made it possible for Pasteur to come up with germ theory. It wasn't until this area in physics was conquered for it to be possible for researchers to see bacteria. This is well-illustrated in this book. <br /> <br />I was hoping for a better bibliography. Most of the books are pretty general, and I was hoping for more specifics to follow up the information given in the timeline with books for students to read in the areas they are interested in, rather than just medical history.  <br /> <br />Only other complaint is the typeface on the timelines is so small you practically need a magnifying glass to look at this book with. A little bit large typeface, and more pages would have been fine.  <br /> <br />Well, off to look up some of the new stuff I found in the timetable... <br /> <br />Karen Sadler, <br />Science Education	2005-04-04

In my opinion, Charles Todd is usually one of the best 5 mystery writers today. I enjoy his books because they are well-written...usually. This one meandered all over the place. I wonder if it was because he was trying to write it from mainly a woman's point of view. I really enjoy his other books, so this was a big letdown.  <br /> <br />I figured the missing mother was going to come into the story alive, somewhere along the line. So much time was spent on the mutual angst of the two characters. Nobody moans that much, and has someone stick around to listen to it.  <br /> <br />The second half picked up somewhat, and I really enjoyed the snippets by each of the brothers ... their take on their childhood, and on World War I. It was partly because of Todd I became interested in WWI.  I am really hoping the next one is more like his original series... <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2005-04-03

Like most other students in medicine of any kind, especially those of us with a predeliction for books and information about viruses, bacteria, and our 'failing' fight against them, I was under the impression that Fleming discovered penicillin. I guess you could still say that, but he sat on it for over 10 years and never did have much to do with its development as an antibiotic. Typical. Our textbooks are inaccurate because in the rush to make money off of textbooks, publishers don't bother to actually use people who know the history of medicine, to research and read what is known now about such situations as the development of penicillin. Like the exclusion of Rosalind Franklin from recognition of her very valuable part in the understanding of the DNA molecule (thanks a lot to Watson), in most medical histories or books that med students read, Franklin's name never comes up.  <br /> <br />Same thing with Florey, and the many other young men such as Chain and Heatley...these guys never received credit for the immense work they did in developing penicillin. It is not enough to find something. Many people discover things everyday, things that could be useable, things that are important...but the 'prepared mind' must be accompanied by plain old work ethics, even grubby work, repetitious work.  <br /> <br />I was interested to see how much the pharmaceutical industry has changed, and medical universities along with it. Everyone is out for the money now. The thought of doing the right thing, and sharing information, sharing technology in order to save lives, rather than merely to make a profit seems to have gone the way of the dodo bird.  <br /> <br />A very interesting book. I hope that others will read and use Lax's book, especially in setting the textbooks right, and getting these men and women the credit they are due. I also think it may be time to possibly set up another committee, such as the one that awards the Nobel prize, only this time, make it so that even those who are dead are recognized for their enormous contribution to medicine. The prize money can go to their families or institutions or charities. That's the least important part of all this...to encourage other young people to spend years working on possible solutions to current plagues like AIDS and Alzheimer's, they need to see that other researchers are recognized, and that mentorship has rewards outside and beyond monetary awards. <br /> <br />Karen Sadler, <br />Science Education, <br />University of Pittsburgh	2005-03-29

That book gave a lot of information that was new to me, even though I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, and my father worked in SF. This book is simply incredible. The amount of photographs of all kinds, including panoramic scenes meant for stereotopic viewers that were popular at that time, and postcards that were 'colored' made this book an incredible find. Not only have I been through it several times, but also I brought it back to my father and mother who were in awe of the detail and the photography provided by the author of this book. Her information concerning individuals, concerning the inability of the fire companies to successfully fight any of the fires (water pipes were broken as were roads made inaccessible)...intrigued me and my father who was a civil engineer.<br /><br />Then my nephew who is studying at a nearby college came and went through the book, as he is studying urban planning. He was very interested in the modern day SF and the author's explanations of why SF is in an even more precarious position should another quake as strong as the 1906 quake happen, due to continued ignoring of the need for quake proof buildings and water lines, breaks between houses, the fact that SF actually has less fire departments now then in 1906 and other major problems.<br /><br />I love San Francisco as a city and where I grew up, but quite frankly, I would never dream of moving back there, partly because of this book. Yet there are other cities equally at risk over poor urban planning (new Orleans for one), and this book would be a good required reading for those going into urban planning and environmental impact on human populations.<br /><br />A truly great book...<br /><br />Karen Sadler	2005-03-22

This was one of those books I've had in mind for years to read, but never got around to it until now. I wanted not just to read the sensationalism surrounding this horrific tale. I have not made it a habit to read all the disaster books. I've probably read 4 or 5. I tend to stick with epidemiology and disease, such as the 1918 influenza pandemic. But I read about this disaster over 28 years ago, when I worked as a librarian and had to shelve the books dealing with this. I only got a glimpse, but as I read more history it became clear that this was a fire that changed much in the  U.S., and I wanted to know why this one specifically had an impact. <br /> <br />The fire itself and the situation both politically and socially surrounding it, are the very things that made me shake my head when people bring up how 'good' the 'good old days' were. Yeah, right...so it was great having people working horrible jobs at outrageous risk to themselves was great, just like having measles, mumps, and rubella was great when there were no vaccines. Makes me want to smack a few heads together when I hear things like this... <br /> <br />Drehle does a fairly good job in hi writing. He is a journalist, and has the background and can do the research. I appreciate his putting a face on the people who would otherwise remain unreal to the readers. But it makes it more excruciating when those people actually die in what you know must have been an awful way to go.  <br /> <br />The books slows down after the fire and the initial outrage. The part about the changes made in politics, in the urban planning, and in society should have been more important than they came across as being. There was no extension as to what impact the Triangle had nationally...just a hint really. We know it changed NY law; did it change fire laws for other cities? We know some politicians made a lot of political hay from this, and went on to impact national politics. But I would have liked to have known more about thenational implications of this fire. Was it reported nationally? How was it reported? Did it make any of the other textile people sit up and take notice? How? What happened to the many involved in the fire (not just the bosses)? Were there any others who returned to work for these same men, or did they just leave?  <br /> <br />I had a lot of questions left for which there were no answers...an interesting book, more than a great one. <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2005-03-07

It's too bad that this book isn't that badly written, though I disagree with the way the book is organized. I got asked to teach chemistry at our local community college for mainly nursing and respiratory therapists. It's their only chemistry course, and we didn't make it through two weeks of this book without finding so many errors in the questions in the back of the chapters, the quizzes, and I am finding more and more on the CD-ROM provided with this. I did not pick this book, and the department has gotten me another recommended chemistry book to replace this one, coming in next week. In the meantime, I have to double-check all the answers and do a lot of the tests and quizzes on my own with material from other sources, because the stuff for this book is so bad. This is not the fault totally of the writers, but of the publisher too, who needs to have someone capable of checking and proofreading who knows chemistry, and can sit there with a calculator and check all the answers. I cannot expose a group of students going into medical professions, who need to have a good basic grounding in chemistry, to such a badly proofed text! <br /> <br />Karen Sadler <br />Science Education <br />University of Pittsburgh <br />Commmunity College of Allegheny County	2005-03-02

There is no doubt that the book is great reading into the EIS, a part of the Center for Disease Control in the United States. This book is especially mandatory reading for those in medicine who are even contemplating working for the CDC. It's good background into the possible postings that these young people are going to see, especially in the post-9/11 world. This will impact not just them, but their families also...these people are exposed as first responders to possible bioterrorism, and will need to get vaccines that the rest of us don't absolutely need. But the possible exposure to anthrax, small pox, and other infectious disease such as the hantavirus means that these vaccines are necessary. <br /> <br />This book just was not the riveting reading that I found in Laurie Garret's books, or the book on the 1918 influenza, or \\"The Hot Zone\\" by Preston. The book is well-written, and less melodramatic as some of these books are, and I would not be adverse to recommending this as reading for public health students. It is just not as interesting as these other books mentioned, probably because I read those books first... <br /> <br />Karen Sadler,  <br />Science Education, <br />University of Pittsburgh	2005-02-14

This was an excellent book, very exciting, fairly well written, good characterization...so why did I give it a 3 star rating? My own personal preference is not to be exposed to constant bad language. I've found in the past that police procedurals written by men, tend to have a lot of bad language. Also, military fiction has swearwords galore, which is kind of funny because my grandfather was a commander in the Navy, and he avoided talking like that around us. Never heard him once speak in such a way as to get my mother mad at him...and we were around him and other military a lot at Treasure Island in San Francisco. <br /> <br />So, though this was a heck of a story, and I did finish the whole book, the language was a severe drawback for me in giving it a great rating. Sometimes I wish Amazon.com or other bookstores would not mind putting on the cover something indicating the level of bad language or sex, say as on television or in movies. It would be a helpful guage for readers in choosing what they want to read, or have laying around the house when their grandchildren are there! <br /> <br />Otherwise, this was an extremely interesting mystery. I kind of pegged the culprit early on, but there were many possible suspects. I especially enjoyed the weather science behind storm chasers. It's an extremely interesting and necessary field, because this is how we learn enough about these megastorms to warn people to seek cover. The people involved are either extremely brave or extremely 'nuts', and maybe both. The thought that someone would take advantage of a family's crisis situation to relieve his/her own personal anger at familial abuse is all to possible, and makes me wary less someone reads this book and gets a 'bright' idea from it! <br /> <br />Karen L.

Methinks they better change the age group for which these books are intended. I am 48 years old and usually read serious books on science and society, but I can hardly wait until the next book comes out.  <br /> <br />This is a huge book. I am not kidding. My medical books could compete page-wise, and this book would win hands-down as far as interest is concerned. But to all those kids who managed to finished this humongous tome, I say: \\"Good for you!\\" Anything that gets the kids away from the TV and from computers has my approval. The only reason I gave it a four rating is because the book is huge! It may scare some poorer readers off because of its size, but it is still a great read. <br /> <br />At first, the going was a bit sloggy, though later I could understand the need to build up to and provide information that readers could use to tie all the book together. Harry is in the crosshairs of those wizards who are coniving with Voldemort (the one who everyone is afraid of saying his name). Harry knows some of what is going on, but those people who care about Harry including his godfather Sirius, and the headmaster of the school, are trying to protect him as much as possible. But in so doing, they don't give him enough information to protect himself, and as per usual, he lands not just himself, but his friends Hermione and Ron, as well as other students he has taught in a major situation, involving a fight with Voldemort's group.  <br /> <br />Harry learns something at great cost to himself, and his life is forever changed because of this great battle.  <br /> <br />This book became almost impossible to put down. Thankfully, I have insomnia, and I enjoyed reading the book greatly. I can hardly wait until July, and hope the next book is almost as big as this one. Rowling's imagination is one of the best I've ever come across in my readings. She certainly puts all the rest of fantasy authors for children to shame, except for my old favorite, L'Engle in whose steps she follows. These books teach several great qualities including courage, the impact of bullying on others, tolerance of differences, and loyalty to friends (to true friends).  <br /> <br />Storytelling is an art, one that has been sorely missed in some of the junk that is being pushed on tweens and teens as literature nowdays. Rowling has provided a reason for kids to go back to reading; and her books have reached a much larger group of readers than just her 9-13 age group. I for one am addicted to the books! <br /> <br />Karen Sadler, <br />Science Education, <br />University of Pittsburgh	2005-01-23
383048:US	53067930	R356LVZ2O0D26H	0143034480	141542110	The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Extremely frightening historical essay...	I went looking for a book on this particular epidemic, because my great-grandmother died of influenza in Aug 1918. She was a grand-mal epileptic who was in an institution in Indiana, and her death certificate stated she died of influenza causing complications of her epilepsy. People who were placed in institutions of any kind up until the 1960's were at extreme risk of contracting infectious disease easily, and in those days when these places were poorhouses or institutions for the feeble-minded the care was merely warehousing. What did the local, state, or federal health care system care about the deaths of people like my great-grandmother...when they were at war, and these people merely used up health care that was better spent on those without chronic diseases or disabilities especially during a time of war? <br /> <br />I was perplexed during the first couple of chapters of this book, because Barry went so far back to start the background he needed to lay for the readers concerning the 1918 influenza epidemic. The medical and public health information was interesting, even if, as other reviewers stated the author tended toward the slightly 'hoky' presentation of information. I got the feeling the author was writing for a possible screenplay...and I found out after finishing this book, that this actually book was used as the basis for a PBS special on this American Experience a few years ago, so maybe that's how the book started as well as explains the melodrama. <br /> <br />However...after this preliminary background was delivered, and I started on the book proper, I ended up forgettin about the delivery pretty-much as the book got deeper into both the epidemic and the public health history of this pandemic. The last time I read a book that made my heart plunge into my stomach was when I read Edgar Allen Poe at night when I was a teen. Most horror books don't have the capacity to raise my hackles like this book did, and there are only about 3 other books on public health and disease that made me sit up straight and pay attention (See Preston's book 'The Hot Zone' and Laurie Garrett's books). <br /> <br />I couldn't believe how much we as a nation, as a world, have forgotten about this pandemic. I've taken classes in epidemiology and I went to med school for neuroscience research...this pandemic was mentioned in passing. I think this is the wrong way to go about it. This book should be required reading for medical and public health students. One, so the symptoms of this disease can be imprinted on the brains of every doctor, so that the possibility of a return of this infectious agent (H1N1) will be considered any time some doctor sees a person with this amazing group of symptoms. Second, that we can change the attitudes and the way we currently deal with infectious disease, because to miss this again even for a few weeks could possibly be the death sentence for the human race (I know, a bit melodramatic).  <br /> <br />It's amazing how much information Barry got on this epidemic given the time period, and the lack of emphasis usually on public health problems. So much tied into setting up the world for having this pandemic. It involved politics in both the governments and in medicine (always); it involved mistakes made on an individual and collective basis by both physicians, researchers, politicians, newspapers, the military who so obviously thought of these young men as merely cannon fodder (most of them...one general over a camp in Indiana paid his own price for making a bad decision that caused the rapid overwhelming of this camp with the flu, leading to one of the worst cases of military cantonments killing more of these young men than the war actually did). <br /> <br />It also involved great medicine, great men and women who worked overtime to try and find a way to control or stop this 'locomotive' disease that cleared a path throughout the world of nearly 1/3 of its inhabitants. Just as there are stories of horrorin this book, there are also stories of courageous men and women, young men in the medical schools of that time period who were forced into early care in hospitals because there just were not enough physicians who could handle this number of sick and dying; women volunteers in the Red Cross and throughout communities who functioned in almost a complete vacuum; men who were willing to override the establishment and expose themselves to death in playing with the known bacterial and viral possible agents as well as so many corpses and so much death that it must have been depressing and panicking to see all this...but they continued. <br /> <br />The last few chapters were indeed sobering, because Barry demonstrated so much of the bad science that I still saw in med schools and the attitudes that allowed this pandemic to continue. We have come a long way health-wise, but we also have newer problems to worry about especially with easy transportation that makes our world so much more compact, and provides a scary situation for infectious disease.   <br /> <br />I felt so bad for the young scientist who eventually died of infectious disease because he was floundering and could not concentrate on a single focus. I experienced that myself in graduate school. It's hard to focus when there are so many intriguing problems in public health and in virology. That's why there is now a system of oversight (or used to be) that helps both grad students and Ph.D. researchers to stay focused on a single topic, a single problem. It doesn't always work, but I think if this many were to be here today his peer group would be able to help him more in staying on track, even those there were men back then who definitely tried to help him.  <br /> <br />Frightening to think that this could possibly and will probably occur again. Makes me more frightened for my children and my grandchildren, and there isn't a whole lot we can do in this situation except pay attention.  <br /> <br />Couple of notes to specific readers. Geneaologists should read this book, because when cities were burying bodies at the height of the pandemic, many people were lost. So those looking for names during this time period had better be aware that this might be the explanation for not being able to find a burial site or death certificate for many people, as the people who did these things were just overwhelmed. Those who study epidemiology should be aware that there are always groups who are ignored during a crisis like this...those with disabilities are abandoned basically by society, yet when they are neglected this population will provide fodder for an infectious agent. This is happening now with HIV in the Deaf community. Do people honestly think that if a Deaf person gets AIDS, so what, they aren't going to give it to hearing people? Get a grip on reality here...and realize ignoring any group for any reason will provide fodder for a pandemic. Ethicists had better deal with the problem soon of rationing health care, because Barry brought up the very real issue concerning this topic and the probability that politicians and society will determine who receive medical care during another pandemic, and Barry illustrated that there will be a loss of individual rights to life and to care in another pandemic. Do we really want a bunch of politicians and lawyers determining our fate? <br /> <br />The newspaper yesterday stated that there have been 5 deaths from an avian flu in Cambodia and Vietnam, and there have been warnings that this could lead to another pandemic as the virus becomes accommodated to us as host. No one seems to be overly-concerned.... <br /> <br /> <br />Karen Sadler, <br />Science Education, <br />University of Pittsburgh	2005-01-18

I think I expected too much. I knew it was a novel, but the way the information was presented really threw me for a curve. The novel is supposed to be written in first person narrative, but it kept going back and forth between that narrative and the author slipping into third person about events the person speaking would not experience first hand. Maybe I am nitpicking here.    The book did whet my interest again into the 1906 earthquake, as regards correct history and the science behind it. If readers want to see something really scary look at the seismograms taken of the 1906 earthquake in comparison to the Loma Linda earthquake in Germany at [...]. That's very concerning especially when you consider all the building and population growth in this area.    So the book was fairly enjoyable, if light, reading, and it did make me go look up some things and get some more books on this...which I am sure is not what the author intended, but oh well...

I thoroughly enjoyed this book about The Smithsonian and how it came about. Smithson was an eccentric...no doubt about it, and there is little for us to go on to guage why he made the U.S. his heir, especially when he spent his life trying to 'ratify' his own place among the elite of England. But we Americans do not refuse a 'gift horse.' Especially one that would enable us to contend with the British museums. Adams may have not had his father's sense of humor, but he was smart enough to accept this gift, and see that it was used the way that Smithson intended it to be used. A very outstanding historical story, and well-researched.

It's a good read for the beach, yet that in itself is a bit of criticism because most fine authors want to be better than that (I would think). This genre is supposed to be entertaining, and this book is exactly that. No less worthy of spending your time then sitting in front of the boob-tube for hours at a time!  <br /> <br />It's hard, I'm sure, to continue writing about a single protagonist all the time. And it's difficult to ask readers to suspend belief over certain things happening constantly to one person (though I can testify that bad things do happen constantly to good persons). Not enough effort put into the plot, and newcomers to Muller's books usually get a better introduction into the characters, and so the characters seem rather cardboardish at this point.  <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2004-08-23

This book was a gift from my sister after visiting Wright's Falling Water in Ohiopyle, PA. I've always been interested in some of Wright's work...not so much the architecture, but the detail he put into his work. I'm trying to incorporate some of his Mission-type look into rugs for personal use, and was looking in this book for examples. No close-ups of detail disappointed me, as well as the lack of biographical information and more detail on specific methods used in some of the more well-known homes, as well as impact he had on architecture over-all.  <br /> <br />This is a great coffee-table book, and I enjoyed the smallness of the book overall which allowed me to take it to bed to read. Brilliant photographs through the whole book, but I wish they had shown more sides or views of the homes.  <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2004-08-23

This mystery of Nevada Barr's is slightly different then her other ones, but no less intriguing. Anna gets sent into Yosemite National Park in California, which in the winter is a bit less crowded but still packed enough with live-ins and visitors to constitute a small town. And like a small town, something bordering on disasterous has happened. Four young, bright, capable adults have gone disappearing at the same time, and enough time has elapsed to indicate they are mostly dead.  <br /> <br />Anna comes in as a waitress in one of the nicer lodges, and infiltrates the young group who works there, trying to find out what possibly happened to these kids. Less on any given information by those she comes in contact with except for the elusive comment that 'there is gold in them there hills...' Anna goes for a walk to clear her mind and spot a 'flat' lake. My husband who is a member of a search and rescue team would tell you one of the first rules is to always let someone know where you are going to be. Anna doesn't obey this rule of the wild and walks into a situation which nearly gets her killed. It also makes her very mad, and like me, making Anna mad is not such a smart idea! <br /> <br />My only complaints about this book is that an experienced ranger would disregard one of the major rules of outdoor living...I know we have to suspend disbelief a bit, but this is a bit too much. <br /> <br />Other than that, loved reading about the park I grew up in, where my father as an engineer installed water tanks for dry seasons and took me with him in the middle of the winter when you could see mountain lion tracks all over the place. Yosemite was and continues to be a cool place...hope we can prevent Bush from ruining it and other national treasures like it! <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2004-08-16

I don't think I've read Victoria Thompson books before. But I have read another series of mysteries written in Pittsburgh concerning a well-to-do woman who leaves her comfortable home and the policeman who falls in love with her during their work on mysteries together. I cannot remember the name of the author, but I am sure if someone was to go far enough back in my reviews they would find a review on this author's books. <br /> <br />Here's my complaint. The book is well-written enough. Unfortunately, it looks like the author took the idea from this previous author's books and transplanted them to New York. I realize people can read books and not realize they get ideas from them. Even Shakespeare was not above purloining ideas for his plays. But when the ideas are this close, there is an editor out there who needs to be doing his job better. <br /> <br />Having said that, once I got into the mystery I found it palatable. The conversations are witty, but you have to leave reasoning and knowledge of history behind if you are going to read these books. In this case, the female protagonist who is a doctor (very few women graduate as doctors back then...maybe not enough to use both hands in counting) not only puts herself in danger in going to parts of the town the gentry never even looked at, she comes across a real and notorious female rabble-rouser and anarchist in the large city of New York (which was comparably as large back then as it is now). <br /> <br />This author also uses another currently popular trick in mysteries, tieing the mystery to the anchor of a very real person...in this case Teddy Roosevelt, who was in city government at the time period.  <br /> <br />A little too much 'borrowing' for my taste. <br /> <br />Karen SAdler	2004-08-10

I picked it up thinking it was a mystery such as I've read by Burke before. I've enjoyed Burke's mysteries for years, but never thought of them as being great literature. They are just fun books to read. But this book thoroughly changed my mind about Burke's abilities. <br /> <br />First time I was in college, I majored in English Literature. I really enjoyed all of it including Chaucer, Shakespeare, Twain, Dickens, poetry by John Donne and Emily Dickinson...but I must have had a lousy teacher when it came to short stories. I hated the things. They were so often dark and I could not relate to the stories at all. I think there is one short story I still remember from that time about a boy on a rocking horse who couldn't stop rocking because as long as he did it his father/family won money. It was a really dark story... <br /> <br />I almost tossed this book aside when I realized it was a collection of short stories. I am glad that I didn't. I mowed through this book in two days straight and probably would have done it faster if I hadn't had other things to do. These stories are not all mysteries, and when they do involve mysteries, they are mysteries about what makes people tick. The last story was about a small boy whose abusive father dies. The local law enforcement wade through the evidence and a story is told in what is found about this boy and those people, such as his neighboring young teenager, who want to keep this boy safe.  <br />All of these stories show great thought, and great effort, and great knowledge of humanity.  <br /> <br />A really great addition to our American literature that will be missed by many unfortunately, the same way I almost missed it... <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2004-08-04

Tinniswood is an author I will be looking for in the future. His history of the great London fire of 1666 makes it memorable, and it is amazing how much is still the same as per politics and political maneuvering by those in power during such a daunting happening as this fire, that more or less razed London to the ground.  <br /> <br />England was in the midst of a war as per usual with Holland and France when this fire broke out in the late summer of 1666. Even though it would have been easy to blame this fire on England's enemies (and some did exactly that...the war-mongers will always be with us I fear), King Charles and his many courtiers and even his generals made it more than clear at the Parlimentary Committee that was established to determine how the fire got started, that the extremely dry summer, the way London homes were built with wood and with extensions over alleys, and the lack of accessible water and plans for fighting a city fire were at fault for the loss of London. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed the research Tinniswood did on the writings from that time period. Not only does he include official writings of the fire, but also poetry lamenting the fire, the various preachers and sermons they gave on what the fire meant as far as God was concerned, and later in the book, information concerning the rebuilding of the city of London. This information incorporates all the thinking of the time into a very pleasing history on a single occurrence, which like the sinking of the Titanic, had an impact on the way people did things. In this case, London was rebuilt with bricks and stones, rather than wood, people were kept from building right down to the Thames (at least for a while), and other laws were incorporated to make all cities safer from fires. <br /> <br />A couple of things I found amazing was how little life was lost due to this fire. Considering the great amount of people in such a small space, one would have expected a great loss of life...butthat didn't happen. The other thing that was amazing was the fact that most people just gathered up their families and things and left. It wasn't until Charles gave his brother the task of trying to stop the fire that anything was done, and he did a good job at it.  <br /> <br />Great history. <br /> <br />Karen Sadler, <br />Science Education	2004-08-04

Oh well...so Ms. Brown's books are as some would call 'light-weight'. And others would say she is anthromorphizing the creatures in these books (giving the man-like abilities they don't have...like reasoning...man doesn't do such a hot job with that ability anyway!) These books are fun reads, and no, I am not suggesting murder is 'fun'. For years, I've tried to figure out why so many people enjoy reading murder mysteries. It's kind of like why everyone seems to enjoy CSI and forensics. It's the problem-solving part of the mysteries, as well as the characterization that people enjoy. In Ms. Brown's books, those of us who have and love animals recognize that they often seem to have more abilities then we give them credit for. They certainly love to play as anyone with cats and dogs can attest to. <br /> <br />The plotting in this particular book was a little off this time. And the solution, even though I figured out is was the particular person involved, I certainly would not yell out that fact at a public place, with no regard as to my own or others safety. 'Harry' is a bit impulsive sometimes...a bit too impulsive. I am glad to see her making some changes in her life that have been long in coming (for the readers of these books).  <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2004-07-24

These books by Bruce Alexander are not major pieces of literature, but they do make for enjoyable mysteries and summer reading. I have no idea of the historical background of Sir John Fielding, but Alexander does a fairly good job presenting him as a blind man. It's hard to be disabled now, and heaven only knows what it was like back then. I am sure most people with disabilities either didn't survive or were beggared out by their families. At one point in this book, someone grabs Fielding's arm to pull him to where he wanted to go. That's a major NO-No with the blind. You are liable to get your head bashed with a white cane if you do that now! Alexander points out in this book that the blind prefer to choose who guides them, and then takes their arm (the non-blind person's arm). Most people probably would have not noticed this detail, but as a deaf person who is an activist, I did notice this attention to the realities of blindness by Alexander. <br /> <br />The story or plot actually has two different aspects. One dealing with a typical poisoning in a family to gain an early inheritance, the other having to do with a young girl and her reprobate father who is trying to get them to the colonies to start over their lives.  <br /> <br />It's interesting how just a few details by the author allows us to step into the dark, dank, smelly, and impoverish world of London. That's pretty good writing when an author can do that. <br />I enjoy these books, and will continue to read them... <br /> <br />Karen Sadler	2004-07-21

I cannot praise the author, his research, his explanations and his writing enough for this singular tome. Like other reviewers have said, the reader goes into this book, whether Jewish or not, with their mouth open at the incredibility of this occurence. It's easy enough in hindsight to make judgement calls about what the the leaders of the Jewish community world-wide should have done about Hitler's rise to power. However, given the economic situation of the time and the Reich's strategems to place all blame for Germany's economic hardships on the Jews throughout Europe, it's hard to determine that even had the massive boycotts been organized and on schedule, would they have work? And even more important, if Hitler was ousted due to the economic stranglehold on Germany,who or what would have taken his place? And would that have been any less devastating for the Jews in Europe.<br />There are few obvious heros and anti-heros in this book, except for the Nazis as being the ultimate in villains. One man paid dearly for his attempts to save European Jewry...with his life. It was not conclusive as to whome the assassins were and who put out the price on his head. It's all too easy to blame the reactionary groups, but there are obvious questions about whether his death was one of convenience so that blame could be placed by the leading group of Mapai at the door of the reactionary Jewish groups.<br />Sam Cohen was a businessman through and through. His reasoning to press The Transfer agreement was purely motivated by money, and not the need to either save European Jewry or to establish Israel as a separate state. It is this 'selling' of the agreement by so many that is so mind-boggling. So many were willing to take the wealth of German Jewry (and later the funds that were supposed to be used to save the lives of Jews who had no homes or businesses to return to) and use it to set up a home in Palestine...it's beyond my ability to pass judgement on these men as to their motivation, yet I am not certain I could possibly decide to shake the hands of these men. The fact that there was a need to set up a Jewish state, and that there was all this money to fund its establishment is beside the fact. At no other time, was any other method even considered to rescue the millions of Jews trapped, even the children...this is so reprehensible as to curdle anyone's blood.<br />And though this happened, our countries, including the U.S. and Britain were equally at fault for closing immigration quotas, even though they knew what was going on in Germany. It was easier to merely close their eyes and ignore The Holocaust, until it became obvious that no one was safe from Hilter and his cronies.<br />This story is just so incredible that I wish there was some way to make it into a movie that does the story justice. I don't suppose that is a possibility. But it is a tremendous story that needs to be included in European history, as it's impact was great. Edwin Black did a fantastic job.

It's probably one of the oldest forms of murders there is. Yet, poisoning is not exactly what happened. The murderer took into account the victim's own allergies and used that against him. The victim was one of these annoying insurance guys who use their looks to sell their insurance, as well as use scare tactics to sell to older people. He had plenty of enemies, and China and McQuaid have to sort through an overabundance of information to find the most pertinent info.<br />As usual Albert puts in a bit of history, a lot of recipes, and some information on the sad disease that is Alzheimer's. <BR>A good summer read...<br />Karen Sadler	2004-07-15

Rather than reiterate all the facts in the lives of these two contemporary monarchs, Dunn zoned in on the both the similarties between the two women, but more importantly on the differences that led one queen to being one of the best monarchs (female or male), while the other one's claim to fame would end up being a martyr around whom fogs of mysteries could be built (and were).<br />At first I was a little disappointed in not getting more information than Dunn was providing. It wasn't until where I saw where she was going through comparing the two women, that I could settle in and enjoy the book. I am quite sure there are more then enough biographies out there on both the English and Scottish monarchs, and the world of intrigue swirling around them. What was interesting about this book is the recognition that Elizabeth's very uncertain childhood had an immense impact on her later abilities as a queen, while Mary was spoiled in the French court and so when she came across difficulties later on, she did not know how to handle political crises diplomatically. <br />Another interesting point, is how much written information (usually in letter formats, or writing from diplomats to their respective kings or queens or popes) still exists from over 500  years ago. We may live in the information age, but these guys managed to get information quite well, as well as spread disinformation successfully.<br />Dunn's writing is excellent. This book was an enjoyable and fast read. Dunn provides an excellent geneaological chart at the beginning of the book, as well as a chronological chart of the time period. In the back is a great select Bibliography for those who wish to continue to read on this fascinating time. <br />Karen Sadler	2004-07-07

His writing is superb, and his plot, though convoluted, ends up making sense. I don't know why so many people are of the opinion that serial killers or mass killers are something new to our society. They aren't. They just managed to hide behind war scenes, and take advantage of the fact that the lack of ready and accurate information made it easier to hide their crimes. All too often, those who have gotten a taste of killing in wartime, find it to their liking, and they manage to make themselves valuable to their superiors (who often know what they are doing but prefer to hide their heads in the sand). I am reading this now in nonfiction having to do with the U.S. and England hiding German scientists because their abilities would come of use during the Cold WAr. I find it very hard to forgive our American politicians and military for using these men when they had participated in such atrocities.<br />I really enjoy reading about England during WWII. It's fascinating to read how people coped with so little, even in areas of filling in public service positions such as policemen since so many of the young men were called up to serve in the military. Lawton describes the diverse ways of making coffee, when the real thing was not available...and the reader can 'see' the disgust on the faces of people trying to make do with such an unsavory mess.<br />Lawton's writing is exciting and he jumps from one problem to another. You would think his young detective would learn to be more observant after being hit more then once. Lawton is an equal opportunity author...his women can be just as nasty as the men in this book.<br />A word of warning for those who are picky about this...Lawton's language is very 'colorful' though it is not on every single page.

I'm sorry, but this book just was not what I expected it to be. Though Harry Dunai did experience the Holocaust as a Jew, his deafness barely entered into it, except to maybe save his life. His typical experience of being sent away to residential schooling in Budapest probably saved his life, since his parents and brothers were collected and sent to the gas chambers. <br />Dunai's life was not easy by any measure, but he had many protectors and many people who cared for him and did so much for him in the way of providing homes and jobs. I don't know if it is the translating of Dunai's own words through his daughter and ghostwriter, but Dunai comes across as a very self-centered human being, who often does not show either the gratefulness for his blessings and for those who do things for him, nor does he express much concern for others.<br />Since I've read so many histories and biographies about those who did care on all sides, this one was very disappointing. The section on the war is short...mainly about how hungry he was. A lot of people starved to death...a lot of other people never had the people caring for them nor the opportunities for escaping a horrific existence that Dunai had.<br />If you are looking for a good book on the Medical Holocaust as it affected the Deaf, read 'Crying Hands' about the Deaf in Germany who were targeted before and during WWII. This book is okay as a demonstration of deaf life during the war and afterwards in Europe, I guess. (...)	2004-06-20

I never know what to expect from O'Connor's mysteries, except for one fact. They are not like anything I've ever read before. I think part of the reason I love her work, is because I studied neuroscience for six years, specifically on the brain. Her mysteries are psychological mysteries, ones that deal with people on both the good and bad sides, whose flaws are almost too obvious. Yet, each person within her books has psychological short-comings...even the so-called normal ones (and those are few). This book center around Riker, Mallory's sidekick and mentor, who is undergoing massive trauma due to a near-death experience. He refuses to recognize his needs (sounds like Mallory), so Mallory tries a little shock treatment on him...which backfires on her. <br />O'Connor characters are the best things about her books. They are rich and they are deep, her characters have flaws, but most of them (not the criminals) have tangible good points about them. In this book, Riker meets a woman who helps to restore his damage psyche who is physically imperfect, and I think O'Connor dealt with this problem of being visually imperfect in a society that demands perfection with just the right touch.<br />The plot is very convoluted to say the least. O'Connor tends to have several intertwining plots going on a once, and I guess some people will find it very difficult to keep these  plots separate in their minds. Me, I have come to expect this from O'Connor, and I enjoy trying to make sense of all of the twists. As usual, I cannot wait until the next Mallory book!<br />Karen Sadler	2004-06-18
634704:US	53067930	R1EPGKHHJZDDM1	1568582587	345430994	War Against the Weak Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race	Books	3	30	46	N	N	Very BIG book on eugenics...dispassionate...	Maybe if this was the first book I had read on eugenics, I would have liked it better. There is no doubt that Black did his research...but much of this information had been given in a few books I prefer, including Daniel Kevles \\"In the Name of Eugenics,\\" and in \\"The Mismeasure of Man\\" by Stephen Jay Gould. Part of what bothered me about Black's book is the title. As someone who is deaf and works in the bioethics/disability community, I was not crazy about perpetuating the idea that those of us with differences are 'weak'. I know that is what they thought back in the early 1900s, and they used much more derogatory terms like feeble-minded and idiots! But the word 'weak' is not one I want conveyed to others who read these books. It's great to have authors write with concern about eugenics raising it's ugly head again...even if they have no disability. However, there are many of us with differences who are working on our own to prevent another medical holocaust here...please do not perpetuate the image that those of us with disabilities need protection from the world. We will kick our own ass thank you!<br />The book was very repetitive of information I had garnered else where. Black provides very little new information in this huge, heavy tome. I think Black is trying to say that the U.S. needs to look at itself first, instead of getting on Germany's case about the Holocausts...because the U.S. provided the groundwork for the Nazis eradication programs of the disabled as well as the Jews and the Gypsies. <br />Black's writing in this book lacks passion. This is what gripped me in Gould's and Kevles' books...is they felt very strongly about statistics being used to label and denigrate people, and about our country's own holocausts. When writing a paper, social commentators need dispassion; in writing a book, passion should underline the stand the author takes. I don't see that here. <br />Black writes well...his book on \\"The Transfer Agreement\\" is spell-binding. This particular book lacks the emotion and yes, even the opinions, that drove that book. <br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2004-06-10

Albert is a good writer and I enjoy learning about the deep South and even more learning about herbs and their ancient usage. In this book, China (the protagonist and owner of an herbal shop and tea shop) is required to confront her unsavory past when her mother calls and frantically begs her to come to the family plantation. Apparently, her old maiden aunt took a cane to a man who was trying to get land from her (probably legally his)...but her aunt is also sick with Huntington's disease. Huntington's is a familial, genetic disease that is much rarer then Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. It also tends to occur sooner in life then either of the other two diseases.<br />So not only does China have to find out whether this man died from being whacked with a cane by an old lady, but she also has to worry about whether her mother and her possibly have Huntington's. Not only does she solve the mystery, but in her family research she finds out the information that helps her to deal with all of this knowledge.<br />I would hate to see people do genealogy research because they are fearful of some disease. Family research should be done to find out information about what your ancestors did and accomplished. Huntington's disease is an awful disease that we still do not know a lot about...they are working on genetic therapy for it (replacement of genes) but still have a way to go. Everyone has 'problems' in their backgrounds, but it should not be approached in fear on the basis of a mystery. Enjoy the book, but take it with a grain of salt and a big dosage of knowledge.<br />As usual, the herbology is great and very interesting.<br />Karen Sadler	2004-06-02

I had read Reich's before and enjoyed her, especially with the forensic science. For some reason, Reich is not near as dark as other current forensic novels. Though she involves the reader in the science, I don't think it is overdone. The plot of this book is way above most other plots in mysteries. I can actually see something like this happening. In my reading for my work in bioethics, just when you can't think man can do anything worse then what he has done, you find out otherwise.<br />There are so many types of prejudice out there. The thought that some men would feel that their intelligence and wealth puts them on a higher plane than other humans, and therefore, those who are less intelligent then them should provide for the needs of those more intelligent men, has it's basis in fact. James Watson, the discover of DNA, which Reich uses in her books and in her real-life jobs, has made statements about getting rid of the genome for 'ugly women' and those with disabilities. Other men have suggested using the disabled for organ donors (of course without their consent), and several European countries are allowing doctors to 'euthanize' at will, so here we have 'intelligent' men making God-like decision. Reich's plot is no big surprise, but it sure would scare me to be in that situation in finding a house with obvious burial spots with no explanations!<br />A very good read...very good plot, fair characterization, good science.<br />Karen Sadler	2004-05-28

Who says they are for children. I am an adult (at least I think I am) and I am thoroughly enjoying reading Rowling's series. Not only are the books well-written and well-plotted, but the characters are being fully fleshed out as people.<br />Growing up I read series books and waited til the next ones came out...Madeline L'Engle was one of my favorites, and the Potter books are reminescent of those books. Rowling puts important lessons in her books, about the value of friendship, about courage under pressure, about doing the right things even if it puts the person at a disadvantage, about learning to not judge others by race or by looks.<br />This particular book is one heavy tome. But my niece and nephew gobbles these books up, and as always, it is great to see kids reading. I hope Rowling does not hang up her pen too soon.<br />Karen Sadler,<br />Science Education,<br />University of pIttsburgh	2004-05-26

I adore history. I love medicine. When you combine the two of those topics and do it well, then you deserve accolades for doing so. Salisbury and Salisbury did a phenomenal job with this (which I take is their first book together). I had known about the outbreak of the 1918 influenza that killed so many Native Americans (including the indigenous tribes of Alaska). I did not know about this particular outbreak of diptheria in Nome, which was, and still is basically out in the boondocks.<br />For those who don't know or don't remember, diptheria is the D part of the DPT vaccine given to all children, several time prior to school years. Diptheria and whooping cough are two of the most awful childhood diseases (though both can be gotten by adults). Diptheria is not just a sore throat. The combination of the toxins of diptheria and the immune system of the child's body creates a membrane that lies across the back of the throat effectively choking/suffocating the child. Prior to the vaccine, there was an anti-toxin created (which again I didn't know) but if the child had progressed this far with the membrane then death was the ultimate outcome. In those days, tracheotomies were not automatically done; the concept had not been introduced yet. And even if that were available, the lack of cleanliness would have still put the patients at risk with that type of medical interference. Cutting the membrane did not help, as apparently it could grow back. Really nasty stuff...and those parents who are into 'natural' do not realize that 'natural' was oftentimes a killer.<br />This book is not just a dry gathering of newspaper articles. The authors talked to those involved, whether the children saved, or even some of the remaining 'mushers' (or their close families and friends) concerning this very good example of quiet heroism. Not only is the writing terrific, but there are some great old photographs, maps (which I needed to follow), and even the footnotes were interesting. The authors wove stories into the story, because they had to explain to the readers the background behind the use of dogs to cross such forbidding frozen country.<br />Sometimes we need books like this to realize just how lucky we are to have the vaccines that are so automatically given to our children. This is a great story, a great epidemiological case study, a great tribute to the doctor and mushers who rushed to save the lives of so many. <br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<br />University of Pittsburgh	2004-05-25

It read very fast. I am always amazed at Grisham's story-telling abilities. I also think it is a good thing he went into writing and not into criminal activity!<br />I don't think there is a man on earth who has not once dreamed of dropping it all, and getting out of the rat race. Patrick Lanigan did not just dream about it...he put it into action. Given that he was in a situation where he knew he was going to be fired, his wife was fooling around, he was liable to miss out on a money-making scheme his partners were involved in (criminally)...he saw an opportunity to do something about it. Many people would have just gotten depressed.<br />The amount of planning that went into this scheme is phenomenal. Lanigan planned for almost every contingency. He knew he would ultimately get caught, so he prepared for that situation ahead of time. He thought of almost everything, and to say anymore is to give away the plot.<br />So this book is not great writing. It's not the worst I've read, and if the book makes you think, then it's worth the time. (...)<br />Karen Sadler	2004-05-23

I thought the plot was great, and of course, Rowling teaches something in all of her books...in this one Harry shows unusual compassion for the person guilty of participating in the murder of his parents. These books are not intended for very young children. They are for the 'tweenies' and older. For anyone to state that these books are inappropriate for children because of subject matter, witches and wizards, violence, etc. is ridiculous...have they seen what kids are watching on television or the video games they are allowing their children to play?  <br />I grew up in the '60s reading all of the Grimm brothers' tales, mythology (Greek, Roman, and Norse), along with many other great books by Madeline L'Engle. The Rowling books/series are good books in keeping with these classics. Books that encourage children to read are good books in my opinion, and these books are fiction, and are promoted as fiction. I love Rowling's imagination, her characterization, and her sense of humor. These books are a source of incredible enjoyment, and I look forward to reading her other books and the new movie to come out(...)	2004-05-16

Ok...I would not recommend this book to anyone who panics easily or does not have an 'iron' stomach. This book is not for the squeamish. Fox does an excellent job of researching the massive problems in our modern-day food industries. She not only includes the companies that prepare and can our foods (such as Gerber, Heinz, Del Monte, and the many less-well-known providers of meat), but she includes the cattle and chicken industries, and even restaurants.<br />This book caught my eye after the horrible breakout last summer in our local Chi-Chi's of Hepatitis A. Hep A is not supposed to be a killer, but the strain that hit this restaurant exposed a huge amount of people to illness...over 600. Among that group were people who had immune system problems such as diabetes, and there were four deaths from what is currently believed to be exposure through green onions. It was unfathonable to many that something such as green onions could lead to deaths; I still have a problem believing that was the source. <br />But Fox makes clear in this book that our foodstuffs are not as safe in many ways, as they used to be, due to modern industry practices, and the lobbying efforts of the industries in pursuit of the almight dollar. <br />The book is fascinating, and the only reason I gave a four star rating was due to the fact that many times Fox's writing seemed repetitious. I am certainly taking much more care of the way I prepare foods, and even which foods I shop for thanks to this book. Like many of the current books dealing with what could be 'doomsday' scenarios, I tend to take the books with a grain of salt...you can't spend your entire life being afraid of things. However,  you can spend more time in care of your families, and I think this book is valuable for that reason.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2004-05-16

I realize there are some who enjoy apocalyptic books such as The Stand. Usually I don't pick them up, but this one was on an area of concern of mine and my bioethics groups concerning cloning and the misuse of those considered of less worth then others. This book picked up all those fears and ran with them.<br />I read many books for my work, and mysteries for pleasure. This book proved to be neither. It took the worse possible situation and put the protagonists in that situation. It also repeated the horrors of the Medical Holocaust, and the indifference of scientists to hurting others in the name of science. It's not that this scenario is not possible. It is altogether too possible and in just the way that Jeff Long writes about. <br />Long is not a bad writer, but neither do his books deserve high praise. George Orwell 1984 and The Lord of the Flies are great classics (though I really cringed reading Lord of the Flies)...Year Zero will never be that. Though none of us should be complacent or this type of thing will happen, I choose to work on the problems of this type, rather than make money off of the possible horrors that could ensue. This book is not entertaining reading...I will not pick up one of Long's books again...<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education	2004-04-27

Goliszek is among the crowd of authors racing to become the next Preston. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, few become that type of author. There is a huge difference between writing to educate, writing to expose illegal practices or bad practices on a journalistic basis, and writing to scare-monger. As one of the other reviewers indicate, this book is loaded to the gills not only with bad science, but bad writing and bad research. <br />As someone who has spent the last few years reading everything and then some on eugenics, I have gotten a bit fuddy-duddy about my expectations from authors. Either they write so well that previous information gains my attention again, or they research so well that they find something else that other authors did not. Anything else tends to get yawns from me, and the book gets relegated to the scrap heap.<br />Also, as someone who spent four years working on HIV in a lab and researching/studying it, it is not HELPFUL in disease awareness and education, when others, who know absolutely nothing about the disease and epidemiology of that disease offer their two cents worth based on conjecture, hearsay, and private opinion! This might be the only book that someone reads on this particular disease, and it provides the wrong information? Oh, great.<br />Writers who have no background in science should not race to write about science without doing the research first. Scientists, who have no background in writing for the public, should not race to write without doing the research first. And scientists who write for science journals are not necessarily good writers. And scientists in one area, should never presume to know everything else about any other science! I would think that would be the first thing hammered into the heads of graduate students in science. <br />There are very, very few Stephen Goulds, Robert Liftons, Stephen Pinker, and Prestons out there...those who try to join this elite group should get their facts straight, and take a few writing classes.

I really enjoyed this mystery. It's been a while since I enjoyed an American female writer's series...they often tend to drop off in quality of writing, and it becomes hard for authors to retain the interest in the major character/protagonist. I cannot tell how many times after about five (when you know they are going for a series) that I just barely get through the book, and I am sure the author feels that way too.<br />This must be a lucky letter of the alphabet for Grafton. I enjoyed the dusty desert scenery I am familar with from my youth (grandparents in Mesa and we were in SF). Also the added information about Kinsey's family is a bonus.<br />Kinsey finds it a treat working with two older cops who are both having health problems on a cold case. As per usual, stirring the pot causes things to come to a boil, but Grafton manages to weave into the storyline several different possible motives, which makes it very hard to determine who killed the young girl in the cold case. Kinsey also shows a more caring side of her in her treatment of the women in the story, one who loses a brother, one who is an alcoholic. Maybe she find a way to care about her family?<br />Karen Sadler	2004-04-07

You would think a little town in Montana, named Libby could not possibly be interesting or draw the attention of the nation (and the world). Yet it does, and will continue to do so. These two newspaper journalists do an excellent job of pulling together all the various threads of the story of Libby. The corporations involved, the miners and their families, the government agencies that did nothing, and the ones that finally got around to it (only to be told to back off by the Bush administration). It's one thing when men were mining way back in the forties and fifties, and even if it was thought or known that the variety of abestos were dangerous if breathed in, not enough was known to control or stop it, and the miners back then may not have taken the information seriously as they needed the jobs for the care of their families.<br />But it's a whole different ballpark, when it's their kids who are being impacted by lung disease...because they played in a ballpark, where Grace &amp; Company dumped their waste/tailings. Or when the men know their wives will die of the same thing through bringing their clothes home to be washed.<br />How very presient of Grace to put itself into bankruptcy, just before this information became widely known, through Libby's activist, Gayla and Les. But wait a minute, wasn't Grace one of the companies written about in A Civil Action? They did not care much about killing a bunch of little children with leukemia in their drinking water, so why would anything in LIbby conern them.<br />It would really help if someone put on the Internet, known companies that are placing their workers at risk, so that we can all look at them from time to time and decide whether we want to do business with them or whether we want to buy their products. We have fiberglass in our 1950's made home, but now I wonder what that fiberglass replaced and where it is in my home.

This book read like a badly written mystery novel. The problem with that is it is basically a book on history, though they classed it in true crime. I cannot say it enough for authors of this type of book, or any type of history...enough with the speculation. <br />The book is written in the form of a qualitative study. Yes, the author did her research, but she has placed herself into the story as an 'unbiased observer' as the incidents happen. First of all, no one can be totally unbiased in a situation like this, and especially when you are dealing with a woman in the early 18th century (who is considered part and parcel of her husband's possessions) and second, a Mexican scoundrel. The people reading the book will come across enough early information about the Mexican impostor to paint him with a very wide patronizing, and inflammatory brush. Given the problems we have today with immigrants from Mexico, everyone already has an opinion of Mexican immigrants, whether it be good or bad, so this book just plays on obvious prejudices. Even before half of the book is written we've already concluded the Mexican to be at the center of all this. <br />The man murdered is viewed as the 19th century version of a couch potato, while his wife is painted as a bored woman. For someone as smart as she was considered, she was pretty bad judge of character, and also pretty obvious with her affair. It's not just that the servants saw her, it's the fact her children most probably figured things out early. I don't altogether believe in her innocence in many things, though she may not have directly used the poison. It's very hard to write about the woman of those days without more information written as history and not an aside, concerning their place in society. Even though she had her own school, does not mean that she actually felt as being in a position of authority or power. That feeling may have come about had she been coniving with the Mexican (whatever his name was...it got changed so often) to murder her husband. <br />The information given at the end of the book concerning the Mexican's behavior and writing as well as his many stories he used on his trips, indicate to me that he may well have had a mental illness, just not epilepsy. It sounds a little manic-depressive to me. He was just chock full of glorious things he was going to do and become, became a pretty good martyr, and tended to laugh inappropriately and behave inappropriately. I strongly suspect that if he was before a court today with the information they had, they might have found him guilty, but with an insanity defense. We will never know now...<br />More history, and less speculation make for better books...<br />Karen L. Sadler	2004-03-29

I get so excited when I find another great writer especially in the medieval era. Not only do I get my history, but a mystery mixed in with it. I prefer my history to be as accurate as possible, and though I know from geneaology, going past the year 1000 makes it real fun to find out names and births and deaths because the only records kept at that time were those of kings and queens, and monastery records. They were just starting to keep written records of the local areas and they were very inconsistent. People could and did disappear off the face of the earth just as if they had never existed.<br />Soon into the story, I became aware that this story was based on Hamlet's story...but not the one that Shakespeare wrote. He wrote a play that was designed to please the masses and get the most information in in as little time as possible. Gordon uses historical records from which Shakespeare also gleaned his stories. This story within a story does a great job of 'filling in the blanks'. When I was in English Literature I did not enjoy Shakespeare's tragedies as much as his comedies for obvious reasons and some not so obvious reasons. I felt that much of the background to Hamlet's inability to forget his father's death was lacking. He would say some things that were poetic alright, but why bring it up if it didn't add much to the story (Alas, poor Yorick, I knew him well).<br />I intend to read all of Gordon's books now and look forward to it. I had no idea that there was a guild for fools/jesters, though that makes sense. Guilds were their versions of our unions today. Besides the fact that they provided shelter and a sense of companionship for each other.<br />I was sincerely glad that the story ended a bit more happily than in Shakespere's version. When Amleth brought out something of Yorick's to give to his son, I was relieved he didn't give him his skull! Excellent writing, enjoyable reading, good history.

With all the political fiascos going on in Washington DC, though this book skirts the edge of reality a bit too much for my taste, I have to admit maybe Brown is not too far off. What is really scary is Brown states that all the technology talked about in the book are available and being used. By WHOM? That's what has me worried. The technology reads like something out of Jules Verne, and the public doesn't know about it? That is extremely frightening to me.<br />This is a fast-paced read and an intelligent one. I thoroughly enjoyed it. A woman becomes involved through no fault of her own in a very complicated quest to make NASA a hit with the country again (this was prior to the last shuttle demise so the management idiocy still stands true at NASA), by putting a stone that is made to look like a meteorite in the frozen ice cap of the North. This meteorite has in it unrecognizable species of bugs that are fossilized. This attempt to make NASA looks good and retain the government's hold on NASA, start backfiring immediately when the scientists involved start noticing inconsistencies.<br />From there on it is a deadly shootout between the bad guys (overreaching government employees...sound familiar?) and people who are just trying to do what's right.

I don't usually pick up Mary Higgins Clark mysteries, but it was late at night and this was readily available in my daughter's room. This was a better read then some of her other books I've come across. The plot was good. I've known and suspected that meeting people via the Internet is not the safest way to go. Too many predators out there. Clark did not make use of the concept enough...just used Internet like newspaper ads for singles. Many times people will talk to another person for months, even years before meeting them in person...and this could have been used more in the story.<br />My big complaint again is character development. I don't know where Clark gets the idea that describing the fancy clothes her characters wear is character development, but that seems to be what she is doing. I guess her books are trying to straddle genres here, being part mystery and part romance. Apparently the female characters also need to find someone 'right' to love in these books also. <br />Ok, enough nitpicking. For a quick read that demands no effort on the part of the reader this book is fine. Even I get tired of the science and bioethics books, and need a mindless break once in a while. :-)<br />Karen Sadler	2004-03-01

When I read about his life, my heart goes out to him. Even when his life is full of problems of his own making. Rebus dislikes obeying authority, and chooses to obey his own moral compass, and that compass is not always pointed in the right direction. <br />In this dark view of Scotland, Rebus happens to be on hand when chasing two young men who have absconded with a car, and maybe a daughter of a prominent politician. Cornering these two kids on a bridge, Rebus is horrified to see them fall backwards off the bridge, on purpose. That horrible sight is enough to send Rebus searching for answers to a whole bundle of questions...all of which end up pointing to a corrupt city government. Those in charge of this whole fiasco are astute enough to appeal to Rebus' own sense of concern for his city and his land...if he blows the scandal wide-open, many jobs will be lost. Rebus is mortal enough to not want to hurt families by forfeiting possible jobs...and the corrupt men who are raking in a fortune through financial shennanigans know this.<br />In the end, Rebus finds a way to solve the problem. I am not sure he is happy with the solution, but then Rebus is rarely happy. Too bad he cannot seem to work as hard at his own relationships and his excessive drinking, as he does at his work. <br />Scotland must be the sister city of Pittsburgh, USA. We have the same overcast skies, and a bar on every other corner, and a church on the rest of them. Loads of bridges too!<br />Karen Sadler	2004-02-17

I used to do very small counted-cross stitch for a hobby. First, my return to college interrupted it, then my eyesight got to be a hindrance to this 'artistic' endeavor. The final straw came when I developed peripheral neuropathy that makes it very hard to handle the small needles. So I went looking for something I could do that would take me away from my sometimes depressing bioethics/disability work, and my always depressing attempt to finish my Ph.D. in science education. My sister and I both reached a consensus that rug hooking would be the answer, as it is a rather large format of crafting.<br />This book provides a lot of information on how to start, where to get the implements, what to use, etc. Even though I enjoyed looking at what others have done, the rugs shown were a bit too abstract and simplistic for my taste. I'd rather hook something along the line of fine art when I get along far enough. The photos are great, and this is an easily accessible book for beginners.<br />Karen Sadler	2004-02-11

It is evident from the glowing recommendations that there is not much to add to how valuable The Thyroid Solution has been to patients suffering from thyroid disease. Dr. Ridha is a doctor at Baylor Medical Center, and has plenty of background in treating those who have been undiagnosed or misdiagnosed with thyroid problems. It is recognized that many people suffer needlessly from hypo- or hyperthyroidism because their internists or family practitioners are unfamiliar with endocrinology and the symptoms that present themselves. This book helps those who wonder whether they are being properly treated and supplies information in order that they can go to the right doctor. Many doctors don't like it when their patients become educated...tough. As shown by the other recommendations, obviously lives have been changed for the better. That is the yardstick by which we should measure what the medical truth is.<br />My family has a history of hypothyroidism. Both my grandmother and my older sister have had their thyroids removed. My younger sister was diagnosed with a cancerous bulge on her thyroid at age 3, and they were wrong, but the lump was removed along with part of her thyroid. She consequently had problems becoming pregnant. I've been hypothyroid for years. My internist was checking my peripheral neuropathy for things like MS and other neurodegenerative diseases of the muscles. Nothing came back positive. Yet, when I'd asked him to consider whether I was receiving adequate thyroid hormone, he refused to consider it. I've been lucky to have him test for changes in my thyroid once a year. The book says a known thyroid problem should be checked every 4-6 weeks, especially when the thyroid levels change. So I've been suffering with peripheral neuropathy and some other problems for over two years; I also have spent much of the last seven years anemic, in spite of removal of my uterus and subsequent iron supplementation. My sister led me to this book...she was positive I was not being treated right for hypothyroidism. After reading the book, I am inclined to believe the book and my sister. I have the familial background, the anemia, the deafness, the pins and needles, and too many other symptoms to count. So I have a referral to a known endocrinologist who is listed as a caring and listening doctor. <br />It's atrocious that physicians can dismiss the intelligence of women, and the ability of them to know their own body. I am tired of such patronizing attitudes, and hope that this doctor will assist me in restoring me to better health. I don't have time for this, and since I have an MS from med school in Neuroscience, I have more then enough background to know when my doctor is missing important signals. <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who suspects he or she may have a problem with their thyroid. If necessary, drag the book into the other doctors and force them to pay attention. If they don't, find another doctor.<br />Karen L.

Arthur Caplan, who is one of the U.S. major leaders in the bioethics movement, compiled this book demonstrating not only the real use of bioethics in determining the right and wrong of scientific endeavor, but also exposing the fact that in spite of all the knowledge the world has gained from the Nazi atrocities and other questionable experimental science, there are still those who would not only use the data from these sources...but would also excuse some of people who committed these horrors in the name of science.<br />It was to my surprise that I found this book, and later decided to buy it through Amazon. This book came about by researchers who were attempting to use and excuse the data obtained through one particularly horrific experiment done by the Nazis. There was concern that German aviators would suffer from exposure upon leaving aircraft that had been damaged in dogfights with planes from the Allies. This gave scientists the excuse to use political prisoners, captured soldiers, and Jewish prisoners as subjects in their experiments. They would dress the men as aviators would be dress and expose them to frigid water and lack of oxygen (as would be experienced by aviators at high altitudes). They would try varieties of means of re-warming these men, including absolutely ludicrous ideas that are revolting now in their simplicity and immorality...which I have no intention of discussing here. I don't know what is more amazing...that these men felt they were doing no wrong, or that some of our scientists would continue to advocate the use of the data obtained from these experiments. At least Mengele and the men behind his atrocious twins experiments had the presence of mind to know what they were doing would not be looked upon kindly. Not only did they destroy their work before the Allies could find it, but Mengele disappeared into the South American continent. The men who worked on these exposure experiments left around not only their very bad data, but pictures of themselves standing there as they slowly killed men by exposure.<br />In 1991, a conference was held to discuss the ethical use of such experiments. Should it be used? Why, or why not? Would use of this type of scientific information constitute an insult to the dead and living survivors of these experiments, or would putting that information gained to use make their unwilling cooperation in these experiments as not having been done in vain? Or did this type of experiment, and those done at Tuskagee, and those done at Willowbrook, merely continue to advocate the use of those considered inferior, or captive populations, by scientists as morally acceptable because the needs of `society' (as described by scientists and medical researchers) as more important than the needs of individuals? Sound familiar? It should...this question has never been morally answered and now, it is the corporations who put vulnerable populations at risk. Only their excuse is the bottom line, and profits. <br />Caplan collected a series of essays by those who were the victims of these and other experiments of the Nazi era. There is also input from those who would use this information in references, in their own work. There is input from bioethicists on both sides of the equation, and some input from notable American theologians. So it would seem this is an unbiased look into this question of when and who decides other human beings are of individual worth or are only of use to society as a whole. What is a bit perplexing to me is that the question needs to be asked, fifty years after the Holocaust, and thirty years after the explosive exposure of American experimental atrocities by Henry Beecher in 1966. <br />And yet it does...and yes we do need to teach these things to the new scientists and new medical researchers, and those who would do business by pushing the moral envelope just a bit farther in the name of profit. With genetics and politics combining to form a new type of eugenics, with stem cell research, the increasing need for organ transplants, emerging diseases, and allocation of limited health care...this book should be part of the required list of those in all these areas as well as in bioethics. <br />As theologian Neuhaus says in his chapter, \\"This meeting would be a failure if we were not made to feel uncomfortable.\\" This book should make all of us feel uncomfortable. Maybe if we all were uncomfortable, the slippery slope to another medical and scientific \\"Holocaust\\" could be avoided.<br />Karen L.

With all the attention given to solving 'cold' or old cases on television, I thought a quick read into a real cold case would be informative. It was. Television tends to condense into an hour the work of months or even years, without getting that information over to the viewer. The person who was motivated into picking up this cold case knew one of those killed, and he was an honest NY detective who felt he could not retire peacefully without trying to solve a couple of cases that had been put to the wayside because of lack of further information (not necessarily the fault of the original detectives on the case). <br />The book is very short, very concise, given the characters that this journalist-author met. This group included the defendant, the lawyer for the defense, the other cops that Rosenzweig involved in the search for the defendant, families on both sides, and others. An extremely interesting group...it was incredible the amount of rationalization that the killer used to explain away his murder of two men over what really was nothing. Other people were equally guilty of rationalizations including the wife and mistress of this man, and even the little town of Benecia in California, where he wound up hiding for years. Many tried to excuse his behavior by saying that he had lived a relatively good life, a helpful life during his time there. But he had never taken responsibility for those lives  he had taken, or the impact on the families of those men.<br />The writing is what you would expect from someone who writes for the New Yorker. Warning: The amount of expletives used in this book is over the usual limit that I care to read. I guess it is to be expected for cops, just like it was and is in the military...if the journalist is being true to what he has taped and not just added for 'spice' to his writing, again, that is part of the journalism.<br />Karen Sadler	2004-02-05

Gee, it's amazing how little has changed over the past 50-odd years. They just released a report (National Science Foundation) showing how few women and minorities have places of importance in research and clinical science throughout the U.S. and her universities and corporations. It's a major struggle still to try to be a scientist, whether you are a woman, whether you are slightly older then the normal student, whether you are a racial minority, or an 'ability' minority. I should know: I was three of the above, and many of my professors in med school for Neuroscience (research) made my life miserable to the point of having to leave the program.<br />Rosalind Franklin accomplished a lot in her short life. She was a magnificent crystallographer: A science which is not used much anymore, but without whom we could not elucidated much in chemistry and biology. Unfortunately, she had many detractors, one of whom is James Watson. Those of us involved and embroiled in bioethics and disability do not have a very high opinion of this man anyway, because of statements made in the last few years involving genetics about 'getting rid of all the ugly women' and 'the lower IQ 10% in society&quot; (there will always be a lower 10% no matter how many people you 'rid' society of until you get to just James Watson!). This book just confirmed that what I thought was the rantings of an old man, were actually the confirmed prejudices of a chauvinistic scientist. <br />If it had not been for Franklin, Watson and Crick would not have quickly reached their 'eureka' moment in determining the structure of DNA. The work of Franklin which was in for publishing was more or less handed to Watson and Crick, and her photography was seen by Watson without her permission. She walked into her office to find Watson going through her work...it's amazing that this information has not been recognized by now. Ethically, WAtson and Crick made use of her work, without giving her recognition. And since theNobel Prize is not awarded posthumously, she was not included in the recognition. Makes you wonder if she had lived, given the obvious prejudice against women still in science, if she would have been recognized. Few women are. In fact, in the last few  years, I cannot remember a single woman in science being recognized by the Nobel Committee.<br />It's time to rectify this injustice. I would hope and suggest that some other group such as Microsoft would provide a grant such as Nobel's that recognizes both minorities and women in science and technology whose work has provided much needed diversity in thought and in science (whether living or dead). The Prize could set up chairs or fund work in the name of Rosalind Franklin and provide the real history behind the discovery of DNA, as well as give her family the retroactive place of pride that they should have in her. Such a prize would also encourage young women and minorities, whether racial or ability or cultural, with the mentors they need to encourage them to go into science. Without diversity, the prejudices of a few become major social programs, especially in genetics. A return to eugenics would be less likely to happen if science is diverse.<br />Karen L.

Everyone says that truth is stranger than fiction. This statement is certainly true in this book. The residents of Savanah provided fodder (whether they liked it or not) for this nonfiction story. Each chapter reads as a separate story, especially at first. I was not quite sure where Berendt was going with the various chapters on individuals, their idiosyncracies, their loves and dislikes even for each other, and the undercurrents of those tensions in this isolated city.<br />It only becomes apparent in the middle of the book that Berendt is setting the reader up for the main theme of the book that is actually about a murder that happened while the author was living among these very diverse group of inhabitants. Berendt actually met with both the suspect and the victim way before the murder occurred, and it is this information concerning the personalities and the backgrounds of the people involved (including the prosecutors and the defendant's lawyers) that provide such an interesting story.<br />I've always passed this book by, though I knew it was long on the bestsellers book, and I was always attracted by the jacket with the statue of the girl/woman holding two plates (which is kind of a virtual reminder of the statue of Justice who weighs good and evil). I suppose most little towns and cities like Savannah have good and evil sides. It should come of no surprise, especially since I read so much of Nazi Germany and bioethics and this information often involves the participation of entire towns in either assisting or ignoring what was happening to those with disabilities and differences under their very noses.<br />Berendt does an excellent job of portraying these people, and the snobberies. I'll bet this book did not sit well with the people of Savannah, but they should find comfort in the fact that though their city was used for exposing the underbelly of what happens, I am sure most other small towns and cities have equally strange characters, and crimes that occur that involve many and display the politics and other fiascos of our criminal system.<br />Karen Sadlercur that involve many and display the politics and other fiascos of our criminal system. <br />Karen Sadler	2004-01-26

I've read both The Burning Road and The Plague Tales by Benson, and I enjoyed them very much. I like history combined with mystery as a genre, or as the starting point for a book. The history behind both the historical murders and the current 'murders' happens to dwell upon the abuse of children and their slaughter for occult purposes. If I had known this from reading the jacket (it isn't obvious nor did the recommendations help as far as providing the reader something to go on), I would never have picked the book up. <br />There are just some things that I am uncomfortable with. Benson writes extremely well, and does her research. The other books were about the Black Plague and new, emerging diseases. I did not expect to find myself involved in a historical atrocity.I get enough of that from my research and writing on the killing of the deaf and disabled during Nazi Germany!<br />Like I said, I did not finish the book. I realize Benson needed a new subject matter linking history and current happenings, and that some of the information was from historical transcripts...but it was way too morbid and disgusting for me. I pitched the book in the garbage. Some will disagree with me and that's fine. I don't want to waste my time on something like this that is extremely upsetting to me as a mother and a grandmother.<br />Karen Sadler	2004-01-10

I don't mind if fictional authors occasionally spout some social or moral opinions in their books, usually through their protagonist. Almost all writers do it to some extent or another. But when the length of the book is dependent upon that soap-box preaching, and when the mystery takes such a back seat to that preaching that it is hard to remember what the plot is about, then the writer has gone too far. I enjoy Rita Mae Brown's books. I enjoy this particular series having to do with fox hunting in the U.S. because I suspect if I had been raised in Virginia, I'd be out on the horses too. I really enjoy the backgrounds and historial information that Brown gives in her books. And the anthromorphizing of the hounds, horses, and foxes does not bother me in the least. I've always suspected some animals are smarter then humans anyway...I know many dogs and horses who are nicer then most people.<br />But...having said all that, Ms. Brown needs to decide whether she wants to sermonize or write a mystery. If she wants to break into nonfiction genre, go for it. But preaching is going to alienate her mystery choir (audience), and it tends to slow down the books and make the books less well-written. <br />This is a decent book, by a decent author...but newbies to Rita Mae Brown should start with another of her older books, because this one left much to be desired.<br />Karen Sadler	2004-01-06

There have only been three occasions on which I've either read the book and seen the movie, or seen the movie then read the book where I thought that both the book and the movie were on the same high level of expertise and fulfilled the expectation I had for both the book and the movie. The first was Apollo 13, the second is Lord of the Rings, and this book/movie duo makes for the third. I do not usually go for sports books. It's just not something that interest me. But after seeing the movie and knowing the book had won so many awards and accolades, I just had to get the book. <br />This book was very difficult to put down. The author makes the world of jockeys and horse-racing (thoroughbred) very accessible, and she illustrates the obsession that Americans had with not just the horse, Seabiscuit, but with his jockey Red Pollard, and to a lesser extent, Tom Smith, the horse's trainer, and Charles Howard, the owner of the little 'engine on wobbly sticks.' As America tried to dig itself out of the Depression and the 'Dustbowl' years, the common people of the U.S. who had so little, needed something to look up to, something to show them that winners do not always have to be rich, or good-looking, but in America winners are the ones with the resilience and stamina to keep going, even in the face of adversity.<br />This story is about three different men with different backgrounds, who had all experienced misfortune and adversity through the loss of a loved one, through abandonment, though shyness. They all overcame tremendous odds, and their meeting must have been orchestrated in heaven, because that horse would not have realized his potential without the love and care each of those men poured onto the horse and into each other's lives. <br />The book answers many questions that the film didn't, such as what happened to all three men. I had no idea the world of the jockey is filled with anorexics and bulemics (so is the sporting world of gymnastics), and yet no one hasever brought this crippling disease to the forefront, I suspect, because these were all men and they chose their profession out of sheer love of racing these powerful animals. The incredible control the jockey's show over their own bodies is astounding. I definitely would never encourage any boy or girl to go into this sport because of the grueling punishment they go through to keep their weight down.<br />One thing in the book, you just did not get enough of in the movie, is the hilarious 'wars' between Red Pollard and George Woolf, and between the rather reticent Tom Smith and the journalists. There were many times I hooted with laughter at the sheer audacity of the stunts pulled by Smith on the journalists who bugged the heck out of him! Pollard and Woolf were best friends, but that didn't mean they weren't verbally nasty to each other. I think they became surrogate brothers who admired each other's abilities with a horse.<br />Just a tremendous book...<br />Karen Sadler	2004-01-06

My husband brought this book home from the newspaper, where they had put out on a table all the books that a variety of publishers had sent them hoping to have their books read by a reviewer. I am no newspaper reviewer, and I never had polio. But I've been interested in post-polio syndrome ever since I went into medical school and read some historical books on Salk, and papers on the re-emergence of problems for those people who had been exposed to polio. As someone who had rubella and who as a member of an internation deaf/HOH group where many had rubella, I can see significant similarities between post-polio and the possibility of latent impact of the rubella virus. So when my husband brought this book home, I read it.<br />I am always a little hesitant when doctors or Ph.D.s put many different diseases under an umbrella of one cause or one virus. This happened too much when AIDS emerged, and it continues to happen with diseases such as Chronic Fatigue syndrome. I did some checking into the papers of these guys and also the actual 'place' where Bruno helps those with post-polio (though it seems that there are current problems with their website and maybe the association of this group with the current medical establishment). If the information in this book is of worth, it is because not that all these diseases and problems are from the same cause (the polio virus), but rather because they are all manifestations of latent viral damage that can be taken care of in some of the same ways that Bruno suggests.<br />It is very apparent that most polio survivors, and indeed, many survivors of childhood illnesses tend to overdo and overuse their muscles and their neurons in order to make up for the deficits caused by their polio. It is also sensible that polio left so few motor neurons, that when a survivor makes it to forty years and they've been dependent upon a few remaining motor neurons and overworked them, that those neurons finally just give out. This has obviously been checked and rechecked in medical journals (the book gives the actual papers applicable in the back of the book so people can read them for themselves.)<br />I don't know if all of Bruno's tricks or suggestions will work. He is a humorous writer, one that can explain scientific information without being condescending. Some of the information he gives is just plain common sense. Some of the information needs to be drummed into the heads of polio survivors just because they keep trying so hard and in the process damage themselves more.<br />This is a worth-while self-help book for this group, and I strongly encourage those with polio to give it a glance. It may help, and it certainly cannot hurt.<br />Karen Sadler<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2003-12-27

I probably shouldn't be giving this book five stars. It isn't like it is great literature...however, Pendergast (the FBI 'Special Agent') does have his literary moments. AFter reading The Ice Limit, I was a little cautious in picking up this new book by these two. I don't know how they write their books, and even though the books are often listed under mysteries, they tend to have more horror/sci fi involved then many of my other regular mystery reads.<br />This one was so well-done (especially in comparison with some of their others) that I speed-read through the whole thing. Yeah, there is a bit of a reminder of relic, but the idea that some evangelistic, fire-and-brimstone father would put his daughter and grandson in a cave for a lifetime...made me cringe for fear that it probably has been done. I know from my own research into linguistics and the deaf, we talk a lot about the Wild Boy of Aveyron (France) and Genie (California) who were respectively abandoned and abused, and how those two were never able to be assimilated into regular society in spite of intense instruction.<br />The 'monster' is the man doing the killing, but in the end the true 'monster' is the evangelistic, abusive grandfather who made the man (along with his own mother) what he was. I am sure the philosophists would have a field day with something like this occurring in reality, because can you hold a person responsible for actions when he has no idea of moral concepts or societal restraints? <br />The writing was fast-paced. I, for one, really enjoy AGent Pendergast. He is a story within the story, and I wonder if we will ever get the whole truth about his background. He may be strange, but he has some redeeming qualities that alleviate that strangeness. I hope Preston and Child's work continues to grow... This particular book took place outside of the museums in which they've placed their other books, and does not involved anthropology as much as myth and legend, and where history's reality lies. <br />Fun read.<br />Karen SAdler	2003-12-27

I enjoyed this mystery. I don't think I've read Crombie before (but I may have lost track given the amount of books I read!)<BR>This story had several sub-plots intertwined with the main mystery, the murder of a beautiful young woman in a park.

This is a real problem in today's world, and it is not easily coped with.<br />It is not until the mystery is solved that it become apparent that it also deals with family relationships. I got led off on several other possibilities for the woman's murderer, but they all were too pat, and I should have known better. There is a twist at the end that does make sense in some ways, though physically I wondered if the murderer had the strength to do the deed. <br />I enjoyed the history of the Docklands (snippets at the front of each chapter) and the history of the children in Britain who were forced from London into homes that were alien in the countryside due to the WWII Blitz by the Germans.

I went through this  book in a couple of days. I have always been interested in medical history since medical school, and this was another satisfying excursion into the discovery of so much medical phenomenon in the 1800s. In most ways, it was better for a woman to have her baby at home through help with her neighbors and midwives. America had the luck to be established through pioneers who learned to handle these things on their own, and even in cities, much was done to avoid being placed in hospitals, because it was well-known that if you went into any type of medical institution, you probably were not coming back out. (as proven with Helen Keller's 'Teacher' Annie who was placed with her consumptive brother in such a medical institution...her brother died there).<br />I had heard of Semmelweis before, I think in one of Roy Portland's history. I found his story incredibly sad, because it is often true that we are our own worst enemies, and he was definitely his. Politics in medicine and in education sounds very much the same, unfortunately, and you have to have the ability to bite your tongue sometimes when you want to lash out at people for their stupidity. This was a concept that Semmelweis seemed to be unable to learn, and his running away from Vienna pretty much sealed his fate as per his true theory of puerpeural disease in women. <br />One thing I felt was important that Nuland forgot to take into account, is the standing of women in society, both in Europe and in America. I am not a feminist, but it is goofy to ignore the fact that the care of women was not considered as important medically, as the care of men. This is imperative to remember, that in the politics as played out in Vienna and throughout the world with Semmelweis discovery, not only was obstetrics a relatively new field to male physicians (it had been in the realm of midwives before), but women were important for the bearing of children, but that was about it. More importance was placed on saving the children, then on the women...because a husband/father could get a wet nurse for the child, and remarry again with no stigma attached because he had a child to care for. One thing Semmelweis should be lauded for is placing more importance on the saving of women, and that was different from his colleagues in that they were more interested in their own careers and prestige.<br />I agree with Nuland's critique of the disease that caused Semmelweis mental deterioration as being presenile dementia, rather than tertiary syphillis. Semmelweis was not a man to have gotten syphillis. He was too fastidious, and too busy trying to save lives.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2003-12-12
872339:US	53067930	R1HMU4FGN7W9Q	074323796X	480038385	Blind to the Bones: A Crime Novel	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Very long-winded, took a while to get to the point...	I love British writers of mysteries. This was a new author for me, and like most British writers of mysteries and crime novels, he is very much in command of the English language at its best. Unlike American mystery writers who feel they have to insert a swear word every other sentence or feel their books with bloody mayhem...British authors, this one included, tend to use the language better and focus on the plot and characters. They get the attention of the reader through their language and many of them give good insight into the psychological reasons for the murders or crimes committed. <br />Booth started out well in this book, and it was not a bad read. It just took him forever to get to the point. I don't mind big heavy books, in fact, I read them all the time having to do with bioethics and medicine. But writing just to prolong the book, even if the language is well-written, does nothing to keep the attention of the reader. I half suspect Booth was trying to bring attention to some problems that the British are having with dealing with the complex sociological problems of small towns disappearing and people have no where to go being pushed out by greedy landlords. We have the same problems here in the U.S. and yet in the end, the information concerning this in Blind to the Bones had very little to do with the murder. In fact, more information could have been given concerning the murderer's psyche...but it came rushing in at the end.<br />I think I will try this author again, with some of his other, more praised books. See if this is a regular problem in his writings, or if it was just this one novel.<br />Karen Sadler	2003-12-08

Cook hunts around for the newest medical/ethical problems and then uses it for fodder for his books. I remember reading and then seeing his very first medical thriller which came out when I was at college. It was about the possibility of using people who were purposely put into a coma, in order to use their organs for harvesting and transplantation. It was one of my first introductions to medical ethics, or the lack of such ethics.<br />Unfortunately, in the past 27 years, medical ethics has gotten worse, not better. Though they manage to stave off in this country the possibility of using people for organ donors against their wish or against the wishes of their families, in other developing countries, this is not an ethical problem. They go ahead and do whatever they want ethically. <br />This book brings up something I a currently working on. The use of women to get pregnant only to have the fetus aborted at 20 weeks in order to use the fetus for stem cell lines, and in this case, a possibility I had not thought of, the very unethical killing of female fetuses for getting to their ovaries which have cells very much desired for use. Oh goody, Cook just gave unethical medical personnel another idea. I agree it was probably out there anyway, but Cook probably provide the ones who were too dumb to think of this with the information they would like to have. All of this is done for money, in countries where they do not have the FDA or peer review, and other such things to keep medicine and science honorable. Not only do such groups prey on those scared of degenerative disease, but they also prey on the poor women of developing countries who are desperate for money.<br />This book did not have a single person who was ethical in it. Not even the Catholics who were approached concerning the Shroud of Turin, did things ethically. They wanted protection from legal mandates concerning lawsuits against them for allowing abuse by priests. Whether this type of bargaining goes on in political circles by religious groups in reality, I don't know. Probably, from what I've seen in my bioethics and disabilities groups. <br />A book without a character who can be considered 'good' makes for poor reading, fiction or not. I forgot how sloppy Cook writes. At the end of this book, none of the various subplots were solved. Everything is just left standing. Even if Congress and political powers tried to do a cover-up of medical abuse in other countries by a member of Congress, it would almost certainly be looked at by the press. A senator dies after jumping from a hotel room 38 stories up, and he is nude except for black socks, and a researcher he had been lambasting in Congress dies with him? No newspaper is going to ignore that.<br />In fiction, plots don't work unless there is some suspension of reality and the reader allows himself to be talked into the plot by the author. This does not happen in Cooks' books. Like other reviewers, I had a horrible time finishing this book. It was boringly written, and the only reason I finished it was because I was interested in this area of medical ethics to begin with, and wanted to see how far and how bad the situation was. If Cook is going to hand out ideas to the many medical businesses out there in the world, I want some type of forewarning.<br />Don't think I will pick up another one of Cook's books again. Waste of my time. Waste of anybody's time...<br />Karen Sadler	2003-11-13

I thought it was pretty well done. Not all of us are heros or heroines. Many women and some men are only forced to act on their lives only when confronted with situations out of their ability to control, such as one that arises in this book. A child is snatched by strangers, and the ability of those strangers to take that child is given by those who love that child the most. In WWI America they had these advertisements saying \\"Loose lips sink ships.\\" The carelessness of an aunt, the lack of observation by parents at sports and dance situations, the lack of concern most people show for their neighbors and often their friends help lead to a child disappearing. <br />It is absolutely imperative that people understand that most children who are kidnapped are kidnapped by family or acquaintances. Stranger abductions like this are rare, but they still frighten parents and grandparents. <br />It is easy to judge the mother, Rachel, for being weak and bowing too much to her husband's whims. I've met women like this, but when confronted by problems, they often shine. They also learn things about themselves and about their families, their husbands that they chose to ignore. Rachel persists. She badgers, she shucks her life of all the unimportant societal standards in order to find her son. <br />My big problem with this book was not with the characterization. We are all different, and the author was portraying someone who had chosen to ignore the things that were wrong about her family and about her life. For the most part the plot was strong, but I thought the ending was curt. It left too much up in the air. <br />Karen Sadler	2003-11-07

I read the other reviewers...I usually do that with historical books because of the importance of those who may have a different perspective than someone like me who is coming into this particular arena of history with no background. I have read a lot about the Nuremberg Trials, much about German aggression, and very little about Japan. Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, with my grandfather a commander in the Navy, I grew up with a sense of pride, and also wanting to know more about the time in which he served, and shortly after when my father also served (Korea). But I also got snippets of information from other readings concerning the very unfair treatment of the Japanese in the U.S. when their homes were raided and they were placed in concentration camps. So of course, I was curious when I came across this small book.<br />For historians and social study teachers, this might be a good book to read for background. Some people write and make history come alive again. Others write history, and most people would put this book back down because it is so dry, and is written with an evident bias that is not always backed up with support. I guess I would have to read the actual transcripts of the trial because this particular one apparently did not gain the attention of the world. Those who came in close contact with Japanese atrocities such as China, Australia, and most importantly, the Phillipines definitely had a different viewpoint then most of the Americans involved in the Trials. MacArthur and the main judge, Keenan, evidently controlled quite a bit of the trials...who came to trial, who did not, who was punished, what the punishments were. I had a problem in that mentions were made of the atrocities, but unlike the very well-known Final Solution, Japanese atrocities were not as much fodder for the newspapers. Heaven only knows why. <br />All countries have time periods in their histories for which they should feel shame, including the U.S. Wisdom is when those countries recognize and address those problems, and many of the Japanese did incredible things such as one sobbing man turning in his own son for almost certain capital punishment for killing an entire Burmese town. If only more of us would show the courage that older man did in doing this, our world would be a better place.<br />I am going to read more on this area/trials, because Maga whetted my appetite, but didn't satisfy it. Whether our side was fair in their judgements, whether the Emperor should have paid a higher price (I think MacARthur handled this one right)...is probably up to those who read these books to make that judgement. It is a part of our world history, and Japan has certainly come a long way from their militarism of that time. Nationalism and militarism is scary in any form, no matter which country is involved. We've seen way too many nationalistic-caused atrocities in AFrica, Serbia, Germany, etc. I can't help think but of some words that said &quot;Judge not, lest ye be judge...&quot;<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2003-10-29

And that is putting it mildly. Most of the time their books are pretty good entertainment, but this particular one about a rather large meteor found in the islands below Chile really went overboard literally. You can almost bet what's going to happen when the scientists and the entrepreneurs try to manhandle this monstrocity onto a large boat (with triple hulls...oh goody). First off, you would think someone would show some sign of brains concerning this hare-brained scheme. Not only is it dangerous, but it is illegal! <BR>Not recommended to take something out of a country to whom it belongs...maybe could have done that 100 years ago, but most people would not want to get involved in the legal fiasco this would cause. Not with people demanding their ancestors back from natural history museums, others wanting reparations (and there are many group with many good cases for reparations).<br />Usually I am fine to suspend belief and enjoy these two authors going at it. That's what their books are for...entertainment value, though I've gleaned a few historical facts from them. But this time, getting to the end, and I won't spoil the ending...but guys, there was nothing there to explain what this thing was! I closed the book, and said &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />Karen Sadler	2003-10-29

It never ceases to amaze me concerning certain circumstances. Shortly after PBS discontinued the series on Colin Dexter's books on Inspector Morse, John Thaw who played the part died. A similar track of events happened after PBS stopped making Sherlock Holmes series with Jeremy Brett, he also died. So forever will my mind see these two great actors in their final appearances as the intensely brilliant, very British, very demanding crime-solvers that they were in spite of the other parts they played throughout their lives. <br />And so when I read this final book of Dexter's concerning Inspector Morse's final days and his last case, I see a curmudgeon with a shock of white hair, an obvious limp, and a tendency to use big words wandering throughout this book. I also see a perplexed Kevin Whatley as Morse's very long-suffering sidekick Seargeant Lewis. And at the end when Morse is dead, and Lewis is struggling so hard to come to terms with information left behind that seems to implicate Morse as a less then perfect officer of the law, only to find out that Morse had been protecting their soon-to-retire senior officer and his dying wife...when Lewis breaks down and cries for his loss finally, my heart breaks with him.<br />Dexter was right to stop his series. His writing remained magnificently British to the end, but all series get stail and sometimes the authors just need the opportunity to move on to something else. And like with Jeremy Brett's death, even the production of a prequel could not be done, because the man who ultimately 'is' the part of Morse is no longer with us.<br />Since this is the last in the series, I gave it a five. Some of the earlier stories are better, and this one was a bit confusing in some spots. There seem to be suspects all over the place, and yet, some don't make sense. But the writing is so much better than most American mystery writers, and as I said, the end nearly brought me to tears. Morse himself, while treating his symptoms which he knows indicate a heart attack in happening with acid reflux medicine, he continues to be himself and solve the one case from which he tried to distance himself, because of personal involvement with the victim.<br />Morse never finds the happiness of human companionship in his life. But his life is full never-the-less with his job, with his music and reading, and with his relationship with Lewis (who is surprised at the end with being the recipient of an inheritance from this man he thought did not respect him. but who loved him nevertheless).<br />An appropriate ending to a wonderful series.<br />Karen Sadler	2003-10-20

Even though most mystery writers give a little past history in the first few pages of their new books, the information I kept getting in the next three books of Fairstein's novels about an ADA who works in sex crimes division on behalf of the victims...well it wasn't enough, and I felt I needed more knowledge obviously given in the first book in order to tie the series into a whole.<br />For Fairstein's first book she did an admirable job. This area of criminology tends to scare me off...and there are some writers of mysteries who write about children and abuse, and I just out refuse to read them. Fairstein handles this area with great delicacy...she doesn't make the readers go through every traumatic incident. If she did, I would never have made it this far in the series.<br />I especially like the characterization of Fairstein. The plot is important but way too often do writers forget to fill out their characters and make them three-dimensional. This is not a problem here. As a real ADA Fairstein has dealt with the good, the bad, and the ugly, and she is able to give the readers a real 'feel' for the person she is talking about. The ridiculous betting done between Cooper and her cop friend Mike over the final question in Jeopardy is a hoot, and a realistic trait that I sure someone does somewhere. The title can be seen to have more then one meaning because of this/<br />Other reviewers have given a bit about the plot line so I won't do it. One thing, if this is Fairstein's first book, she definitely gets better as she goes along. Very enjoyable series.<br />Karen Sadler	2003-10-08

If we could give stars for books like they do for children's toys, for writing I would give Moore a five. This was a quick book for me but a rough one too. This book is not a mystery, but rather what one reviewer calls a 'crime procedural.' I don't read real crime very often, and reading mysteries tends to give the feeling of unreality. I've often questioned why so many people including me enjoy mysteries. It seems rather odd that we enjoy reading about murder, yet in mysteries it is not the murder itself that is important, it's the solution to the murder and whether that solution makes any sense.<br />In a book like this one, that sense of unreality is gone. I am sure that is Moore's desire. He also gives it a unique viewpoint, that of an Asian-American, so he is breaking sterotypes, but not really, since many of those I know in science and math enjoy puzzles, and murder is the ultimate puzzle. <br />SErial murderers prey on the people least protected, often times. Parts of society in whom serial murders often work, such as prostitutes, tend not to generate an outcry against the brutality by the rest of society. Now the AIDS epidemic has made those who are gay more politically active, and they can raise the cry against such crimes more than before, but still not enough. When a child is involved, the changes the whole scenario, and to an extent, that is not fair.<br />In this book, the detective Sakura, has to deal with this heinous crime as well as meet his wife's needs. He has to play politics, when there is no time for playing politics. What Sakura doesn't know is that the murderer is getting too close to home. <br />An interesting  plot, using fallen angels, as the reason for the serial murderer to stalk his victims. The twist does not completely make sense to me, though it might to those who have more knowledge of the apocryphal texts. <br />This is a violent and bloody book. What was very interesting is at the end, not everything is solved. In fact the murdershave more impact on each individual involved including Sakura, an FBI mentor, a best friend, and his own wife. Not many books deal with the fall-out from such a crime, and this was well-done.<br />Karen Sadler	2003-10-08

So thanks guys for recommending this nonfiction read! Almost as quickly read as my mysteries.<br />The need for so many people to collect items, animals and even humans (would someone please stomp on Admiral Peary's grave for a while)! Geez. You wouldn't think people would be so obtuse as to not realize that living, breathing human beings do not belong in museums as specimens of a tribe or culture we do not know. But obviously the wealthy who often did the collecting, or those 'explorers' who put fame and glory above compassion had a problem with understanding basic human rights. And yes, if tribes ask for their ancestors back, the bones should be returned and buried. How would we all feel if someone went and dug up our grandparents and put their skeletons on display without concern for our need to respect them? You don't see museum guys going to dig up white American or English cemetary plots, do you?<br />Okay, off the soapbox. A fun read, well-written, well-researched. Preston went on to write several books using the museums as a somewhat creepy place, and frankly after reading this and other books, I don't think I'd want to be locked in the American Museum of Natural History. Pretty sure I'd freak out...too much past with too many ghosts attached to it. Besides, this place sounds like a mausoleum. Having just returned from visiting the Mutter Medical Museum in Philly with its assortment of bones, oddly shaped fetuses and a variety of other things like hands floating in some type of suspension fluid showing small pox at its worse...yikes, I don't know how much of this stuff I could take, and I took medical classes in the Morgue!<br />The history of the museum is fascinating...thefact that we are able to see so little of this makes me yearn to do exploring down in the 'tombs' and hallways in the presence of company and full daylight, thank you.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2003-09-30

It comes through all too well in this book. It's not that it is not a good read...for most people it will probably be a good read. But I got the feeling while reading this book that Powlik had a book or an outline in front of him telling him what was necessary to write a biological thriller. He has to have a current new problem that people don't know enough concerning, he has to insert a little romance here, an aggravating character there, add in lots of mayhem and an awful lot of deaths (especially of the characters we are not supposed to like). And in addition, he added an epilogue that prior to reading it I just knew what it was going to say...this particular bad strain of pfisteria (yes I've read about it in the science journals and a couple of nonfiction books) was going to 'pick' a compliant new host, and in this case, fly off into the sunset to wreck havoc another day. Just a bit too pat...like I said, I think Powlik is a smart man who wants to be a thriller novelist of the Clancy-kind. Ho-hum.<br />As per usual, mankind fooling around with biological entities tends to lead to disasters as well as possible good uses. I applaud Powlik for his desire to educate the public not only about this organism, but also about the fact there are military and private organizations fooling around with things that they probably should not be fooling around with. Anything to make a buck; anything to one-up other countries in biological and chemical weaponry. It's kind of hard to get away from this lately, with the fiasco in Iraq and the inability to find weapons of mass destruction. <br />My major complaint as always does not have to do with plot. It's the characters. They are too many, too cardboard, and too stereotyped. Robin Cook, and Michael Crichton and Richard Preston have all successfully scared the pants of those who enjoy reading these types of book (and I usually do too)...but this one left a bit to bedesired.

They are so well-written, and the history of the time period after WWI is so interesting. It's hard to realize in this day and age, with America's 'war' with Iraq, how lucky we are. We as a nation will not forget those who died over in Iraq, and whether we question the President's reason for going to war or not, Saddam had to be dealt with. What is important is the number of men (and women) now who have died in this war is so small compared to the thousands of boys who died in WWI. And those who came home, were many times mortally wounded in the mind, and spent their lives like that. This is not to glorify any war, or deny that families are hurting now, but we need to remind ourselves how nasty WWI was, with the trenches, mustard gas, sarin, and the mud. I can only pray that we never go back to the days of wars like that, or the Vietnam War, and that we value our men and women who gave so much now. Todd's writing is a good reminder of how absolutely horrid that war was, and how many people were hurt. England fought to recover from the loss of an entire generation of young men, and the way the war ended was by mutual truce...but also it left Germany in such a way as to make it ready for someone like Hitler.<br />Back then there was little understanding of 'shell-shock', or what is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder. These men were expected to come home and take up their lives as if nothing had happened, because so little was understood about the psychological impact of this nasty time period. That Rutledge has to deal with Hamish, a Scot he had to have shot because he refused to send young boys out to be killed on the basis of rich/powerful men behind the lines playing these guys like they were a board game...it is not that unbelieveable that Rutledge has this 'ghost' with him always. <br />In this case Rutledge is doing better. It's been a year since the truce, and all of the sudden a woman whose husband was hung prior to the war due to his committing murders...she comes to Rutledge with what she calls proof as to his innocence. The major charge against capital punishment is the fact that too many innocent men have been put on death row by prejudice or accident. Rutledge is horrified by the idea that he might have sent a man to his death who was innocent. This in connection with another set of murders in the present day (of 1919) of veterans of war, has Rutledge torn in different directions. The fact that he holds down his fear and doubt of himself, to successful get through to the truth in both cases, and deal with a German whose face he is familiar with and thought was dead, is indication that Rutledge is finally coping with his life after the war.<br />A good, intelligent read (which is often to hard to find nowdays...)<br />Karen Sadler	2003-09-16

There is little need for me to go on and on about David McCullough's ability to write history and biographies. It is obvious from the other reviewers and how long this book has been at the top of the top 50 books, that McCullough has surpassed himself with this book. The sheer amount of staggering letters that went between Adams and his beloved wife, Abigail, as well as to his friends, to those he worked with for American Indepedence, to his children left an incredible amount of information on this very great man. If this book had been written by anyone else...it would never have been done with the utmost respect, awe, and yes, love that McCullough treated this ultimate story with. I had always known about the relationship between John and Abigail Adams as being one of the most steadfast and supportive marriages that has ever been told. I knew she was an incredible woman for her century, and she supported her husband in every way; and he supported her equally in every way...recognizing that she was worthy of the same respect as his peers in Congress. It was to her he turned for support, and she gave him valuable advice, because her education was a life-long continuing education, very rare for that time period. Truly one of the first women suffragettes who reminded her husband to remember the women always...<br />John Adams is the type of man we very rarely see anymore. How empty our country seems of men of his ilk, of his integrity, of his ability to do the right thing even when it is unpopular. He gave our country a much needed grace period to grow up, when the war-mongers such as Alexander Hamilton, were seeking war with France for their own glorifications. Adams stayed silent when abuse was heaped upon his head, unfairly. He forgave the many who hurt his feelings, including Jefferson. I had always admired Jefferson as being a genius like De Vinci, but having read this book it is clear that Adams was the stronger and more sane voice...willing to risk all (as his wife was).<br />If social study teachers have their students read one major book in American history, it should be this one. Maybe with the influence of David McCullough and his previous works with Truman, we will once again have giants of reason walk among us. <br />The book and the man are truly inspirational.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2003-09-07

Rebus is one of the best cop protagonists out in the market today. He is a very complex person, who is no longer sure of himself or of the job he is supposed to be doing as a detective inspector in Edinburgh. His family is broken up, his daughter injured in an `accident' that was intended for him, his relationship with his new significant other is on the rocks, and his relationship with his bosses is in the toilet. Probably from his rather unorthodox methods. Rebus is not afraid to mingle with the morally-challenged underside of Edinburgh... he makes his own rules up as he goes, and that particular trait of his tends to get him in trouble. <br />In this book, Rebus has way too many strings to hold onto. A young man has gone missing who just happens to be the son of one of Rebus' old flames. The U.S. is ever-so-nicely sending home a known serial murderer, who continues to wreck as much havoc as possible in Scotland. Rebus also gets involved in another case concerning a pedophile (I hate reading books on that particular topic!), and the embarrassment leads to bad press for the cops. <br />Rankin is a good writer. Trouble is he puts way too many off-shoot plots in his books. It makes it very difficult to keep track of these guys and the plots. I do like Rankin's ability to characterize. His characters come across as real people, with real problems, and this is one of the traits I look for in books.<br />Karen Sadler	2003-09-05

This book was very light reading, you could blow it away like a dandelion. I like my books with more heft to them. There was not enough characterizationthe people came across as being cardboard. Graves means well as a writer, shes picked an area which no one else has, concerning a woman and her friends who get involved in mysteries through their home repair. Thats very strange to say the least, but there are other mystery writers out there who use cats, who do catering (which leads to trouble), etc. So I guess a book using home repair as a catalyst for crime is not any more farfetched then the other things. <br />This book was so uninteresting to me, that every time I picked it up to finish reading it, I couldnt remember the plot line or the characters, and Id  have to read back a bit to remember what it was about. I know my memory is shot sometimes, but it isnt that bad, and I dont have that problem with other books!<br />Karen Sadler	2003-09-05

Probably because I've seen some of the Discovery Channel and other education stories about the Oak Island treasure and the deaths it has caused to those searching for it. Besides, I'm not overly fond of the ocean except with my two feet on land, and looking out at it! Besides my husband's family includes Captain Kidd...there are loads of them out here in Beaver, PA. (poor guy, he was not really a pirate but that's another story).<br />The basis for this story is the same as Oak Island. Someone gets this juvenile idea of getting rich quickly, and so they pounce on the owner of this island who has horrific memories of playing there as a child and losing his brother to it. These modern day treasure hunters are so arrogant, because of all of their machinery, that they continue the search regardless of the fact that the island seems unstable, people are dying with no obvious reason, and the electronic machinery is going haywire.<br />But the 'captain' in charge of this treasure  hunt is a bit on the manic side, and won't listen to anyone. He wants not just the gold but something called St. Michael's Sword, at any or all cost. Unfortunately, what he got is not what he imagined!<br />This book was less enjoyable then the other Preston/Child books. It really gave me the willies, and punched up my anxiety a bit with the claustrophobic conditions. But it is still an enjoyable book, just don't go on the ocean and read it!<br />Karen Sadler	2003-09-03

I am thoroughly enjoying reading Preston/Child's mysteries. They are unusually intelligent and well-researched books, with interesting and clever characters. Pendergast, who works for the FBI, seems to proceed at his own pace and has a tendency to go over and around anyone who gets in his way. He also tends to speak at a level that neither the politicians nor local police have an inability to deal with. <br />You would think after all the Indiana Jones movies that people would understand that some anthropological and archaeological finds would be better off left alone. Inevitably, someone `moves' something from its origin, and people start paying the price for not respecting the `old ways'. <br />This was a very different mystery, in that the information concerning the killer or killers depends upon scientific knowledge. Pendergast seems to be knowledgeable in most areas, and if he doesn't know it, he finds out about it. He warns people not to do certain things or allow certain occasions to happen for fear of what might occur since the murderer is still loose. And as he rightly assumes, people get hurt. Usually, Pendergast finds other intelligent people who are willing to work with his unusual ways in order to put a stop to these horrible occurrences.  <br />I am thoroughly enjoying reading about the museums in New York, where Pendergast often has to show up because of odd happenings. The archeological and anthropological areas are a couple of sciences that I did not get a lot of training in school, and often these mysteries give some bibliography to read up on the reality behind Natural History Museums. Maybe Pendergast should come and explore our own Carnegie Museum here in Pittsburgh. If only 10% of what a museum has is on exhibit at any given time...maybe they should give guided tours through the storage areas of the museums! Of course, now I would be hesitant to do it, given reading Preston/Child books!<br />Karen Sadler	2003-08-26

I am getting the distinct feeling that many people are not happy with this information concerning fox hunting in America. Myself, I find it interesting (since Virgina is barely a hop, skip, and a jump away from Pennsylvania). Also, many readers are a little skeptical of Brown's anthromorphizing of the animals in her book. Even though we do not understand everything there is to know about animals, I do know as a scientist that many of the past ways of looking at animals are untrue. For years, scientists said animals did not play. That's been disproven on many fronts. When was the last time you saw an otter? Sometimes I think all they do is play and preen themselves. And zoos are now giving animals all kinds of 'human' things like balls, ropes, etc. because they found out that animals like bears and monkees are prone to depression if they don't have much to play with, or never see anything new to explore.<br />Enough of the ranting. I enjoyed this book. It obviously came before one of her other books I read with 'Sister' in it. Some of the talk between the animals is absolutely hilarious, just because I can imagine the dumb things that we do as humans probably amuse them. As for animals like foxes becoming used to people, it does happen...we went camping and had three skunks as visitors, who would munch on marshmallows for an hour while around the campfire, and then left to bug someone else. Screams all over the campsite but no one got sprayed. Those skunks knew we were a source of treats. I don't recommend feeding wild animals usually, and especially with rabies in raccons and skunks. But these guys were harmless, and just after our food. I imagine the animals got a big kick out of scaring campers too.<br />Rita Mae Brown has always been a favorite of mine, and will continue to be as she writes. She is a good writer, and I happen to like the dialogue between humans and between animals. This is a method of writing that has been around for a long time...remember Watership Down, and of course, Animal Farm by George Orwell. This is just a light and enjoyable read. When you have to read bioethics and science stuff all the time, it is nice to have something like this at your bedside.<br />Karen Sadler	2003-08-18

The way he writes has a lot to do with that. Over the past few years there have been an incredible surge of non-fiction books written by reporters on natural phenomena and the impact of man (or the interference of man). Many of these books have been written by reporters, and they have been excellent. This is another book to add to the list.<br />Like Reiss indicates there are many who have noticed strange weather patterns, and I am one of the many people who have noticed the changes in weather. Living in Western PA, we are on the very edge of the Tornado Alley, and we usually don't get a lot of tornadoes over the years, but we've had extremely strange weather. Droughts for three years, no snow when you can look at historical pictures of Pittsburgh having loads of snow (albeit dirty from the steel mills). The past few years have seen increases in what are called 'microbursts', which cannot be followed by any known means of radar.<br />I am not a die-hard environmentalist. I am probably the most aware person who is geared that way in my family, because I love nature, forests, and the wonderful wildlife that goes with this. There are many things that this book is making me think about changing including making my house more energy efficient. <br />This book is actually a very fast read for those who have an interest and training in biological and weather phenomena. It should also be required reading for those in politics. It's extremely scary the world we are leaving our kids and our grandkids, and we need to start as Americans to require our politicians to pay attention to global warming and the strange weather that goes with it. As it is, I vote for Bush Jr. this last time, but I am sorely inclined to vote against him because of the total lack of concern for the environment that he shows (as well as some other things). <br />This book is also interesting in giving the readers an introduction into the way politics shapes nationaland international policy not only concerning global warming, but things like AIDS, relief for some countries and not others, etc. I get very, very tired of the input of politicians into areas that they know nothing about, and that they don't even try to learn about. They just spout whatever they are told by those who funnel the money to them. <br />I thought this was an incredibly intelligent book, with an interesting format. The stories of extreme weather conditions are mesmerizing. <br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2003-08-08

Great literature they are not, but they are very well-written and very researched. This one involved the museums in New York (which I really, really want to see thanks to this book). A shipment of artifacts to share with other museums goes a bit awry, meaning one of the sarcophagus' open and share it's inhabitant to the men loading the artifacts. It becomes too apparent that the woman inside, though well-preserved is not a member of the royal Eqyptian family! <br />Cooper and Chapman have their hands way too full this time. Part of it is due to heat, crime goes up with heat. Part of it is sheer stupidity of the criminals. Fairstein does a heart-breaking analysis of 9/11 and its impact on both the city and the people who rushed to respond (cops, firefighters), and it made me remember the anquish all over again.<br />Cooper and Chapman have a good working relationship. They need to in this one, since the museums are bound and determine not to let the police interfere even though one of the museums is harboring a killer. <br />Thanks to Fairstein, I got a lot of background about museums I didn't know. Very interesting. What a warren of rabbit holes, filled with stuff we will never get to see, though I would love to visit down there. Maybe the museums should think about having limited tours for those who are interested in seeing the old and 'other' stuff.<br />Fun book for the beach.<br />Karen Sadler	2003-08-05

I have not read a book by this duo, though for some reason I cannot specify, the names keep ringing up familiar. No matter. Incredible writing, incredible read. I kept thinking, if they could just do this right without ruining the tale, this would make a great movie. But most mysteries lately have left viewers disappointed in comparison to the books.<br />This story starts in a place I've been dying to visit, pun intended. The New York Museum of Natural History. I had just finished another mystery involving this place and had actually been trying to find some of the nonficitional books concerning museums, when I ran across this novel. I started reading, and couldn't put it down.<br />Odd is not the right word for Dr. Pendergast, a somewhat shadowy character who works for the FBI. He makes me nervous, especially when he feels that all locked doors are meant to be opened by him. An excavation site in New York digs into old tenements and they find a slew of skeletons with more than obvious markings from the turn of the century, indicating their deaths were not normal, nor were they pleasant. Someone was removing the area of the body known as the spina equada down at the lower back, which includes the tailbone and the nerves enervating the legs. The big problem is that whoever did this, made sure his victims were still alive and probably conscious. <br />When a copycat killer starts after a newspaper article is written up concerning the 'find', Pendergast involves an archaeologist, an unwilling cop, and a journalist with somewhat questionable methods and values. All of this ties together into a very exciting journey through the bowels of NYC, into old neighborhoods and houses, and through the maze that is the NYMNH museum. As with almost every good book some degree of allowance needs to be made for information or abilities that must be used to solve the case. In this case, Pendergast has a unique ability to literally put himself in the past, and yet to an extent we allhave some thing like this in our own memories...we just don't develop it to that degree. So what...it makes for a great read.<br />Can hardly wait to go get another book from these two!!!<br />Karen Sadler	2003-08-04

It was not considered an 'important' science such as physics, biology, or chemistry...but rather something for those who were specifically interested in weather, classes were offered. Even though I reached a higher level of science education, weather science was never offered as a possible elective. People tend to make fun of the weathermen/women...because weather is such an inexact science. But those 'pretty' faces on our televisions are much more trained then they were five or ten years ago, many of them having degrees in metorology. <br />BBC is just continuing the inroads made by popularizing certain sciences similar to what can be seen on Discovery Channel or on the Weather Channel itself. And of everything studied in weather, no type of weather phenomenon has instigated as much interest as tornadoes (and hurricanes to a lesser degree). This book shows those phenomenom...but also all the other parts of weather that lead up to such catastrophic events. Weather is hardly just tornadoes...in fact, tornadoes are limited pretty much to the continental U.S. and also limited to a few months out of the year. Even more important I think, as a scientist and teacher is rain and drought, since our abilities to feed ourselves and others are dependent upon that. <br />This book covers basically everything...and it is basic, with pictures and sidebars taking up a lot of space. The science is kept to a minimum, and the sidebars are full of interesting little facets of weather science. This is a good introductory book (especially for use of the pictures and photographs), but there is more information out there on the weather that is more scientifically and clearly presented by groups such as NASA and the NOAA, who do a lot to keep track of the weather. This book used in conjunction with other web sites and internet information can be valuable. This is another one of the sciences like biology, that changes quickly over small periods of time, as new technology such as satellite systems become available to accurately track weather systems across the world. So no book is going to be valuable, or more importantly, accurate for very long.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2003-08-01

Rankin's books about Inspector Rebus and his colleagues on the police force in Scotland are very bleak mysteries, with more than a shred of reality about them. Those who move from American mysteries where the protagonists are able to solve the crime and deal with a variety of other problems at the same time, may find Rankin's books hard to swallow. To me, they seem more like what truly happens in life...at the end of this book, Rebus is presented with the fact that his nemesis (who he had put away for a while) had just gotten away with not just one, but several murders...and there is not one thing that Rebus can do about it! No wonder Rebus is so bleak: his own personal life consists of alcohol and music and concern about his daughter who was hit by a car, he not only has to fight those up at the top who disagree with his manners of handling cases but he also has to deal with snakes on his force who have problems with the word 'No' from his female partner, and he runs into the darkest forms of human life on his beat and he cannot put them away (or deal with them as he would like and still remain within the law).<br />Rebus fights to come to terms with his own mortality and his own moral compasses in this book. Rankin's writing is excellent, and as per usual, the education they get over in Britain and Scotland (now a more separate entity) leaves our own educational system in the gutter. I find myself having to look some things up, and saving others for later because Rankin is writing over my head. Of course, I do not recognize the music he instills as a passion into Rebus, except for the very old stuff.<br />If there are any complaints about Rankins's books, it is that there are threads of plots all over the place...and weaving them into a whole is often difficult. Some of them make sense, such as Rebus' partner dealing with an overly ambitious coworker who she goes out with for a few times, and then decides not to see anymore outside of the 'office' because he doesn't interest her and his own moral compass is skewed. This guy stalks her, and unfortunately for him, doesn't do it well enough to keep her partner, Rebus, in the dark. When Rebus catches this idiot in the act, it colors their own perception of each other and they find it hard to work together to solve the homocides they are working on. <br />But the little thread of dual rapists is too much and adds little to the story, besides an inconvenience to be worked out. Life is not tidy, but neither is it as dark for most of us as Rebus finds it in this book. Sounds to me like Scotland gets as little light as we get in Pittsburgh, PA in the winter. Rankin even brings up Seasonal Diffective Disorder (SAD) which is a problem here because of sunlight. His work may be psyhologically dark, but I still want to go to Scotland to see the places he talks about historically.<br />Karen Sadler	2003-07-31

I am still undergoing the trauma of being diagnosed. I am in the situation I am sure many of those with MS all go through, some doctors positive I have MS, some not so sure, going through all the testing for it and have some come back positive and some come back negative (for now at least). It's a very frustrating position to be in, not just for the person directly involved, but for the family to be in.<br />As I spent 4 years in med school for Neuroscience, you would think I would know everything, but not so. The area is so large now, that they just barely touch on MS, and then more on the advanced stages and dementia possibilities in it (don't jump to conclusions...I am not positive MS causes dementia, just they speculate with no absolute proof). So when this possibility hit me within the last year of agonizing pins-and-needles sensations first in feet and then going up to my hands, I was desperate for information.<br />This is a pretty good book. The authors know what they are talking about. They don't talk 'down' to the readers, they try to meet their needs for specific information on specific problems, give answers or places to go for answers. One thing I needed was to be able to show my husband some of this information that coincided with what I was telling him. MS is not a very visible disease at it's onset unless it is acute. It's hard to show your family you are in pain when there is nothing to see. Now when I start falling in front of them for no reason...then they start paying attention.<br />Sometimes people have to go to books and Internet to get answers because their blasted physicians aren't forthcoming and too often they are so busy shuttling patients in and out that door in order to make money, they forget the patient as an individual. One thing to stress, this book doesn't have all the answers, and everyone who undergoes MS has different symptomologies so they cannot possibly cover everything.

Apparently he is a major documentarian of the Holocaust, and this book is very much needed for reasons I will explain later. The format of this book is basically a chapter concerning each country invaded by the Nazis and the efforts of the few (compared to the many who turned their heads and ignored the fate) who attempted to rescue their friends, their neighbors, and the strangers who came to them who were of Jewish backgrounds. Each chapter names those whose names are known, who are honored in Israel in the Vad Yeshem Righteous Among the Nations. It also tells the stories of some of these rescues, and though given the fact that little is known concerning these rescue attempts (as many involved are dead)...the book could have been written in a better way than a mere listing of those involved.<br />What is interesting about this book, is the surprising number of those who were complete strangers who took Jews in. Also, information concerning those who were anti-Semitic but totally disagreed with Hitler's Solution who risked their lives and  the lives of their families in order to save individuals and family groups. It becomes evident that more children and women were saved, then men. Many ministers, and Catholic monks and Sisters also saved many Jews on their own initiation, with disregard for their own safety.<br />Even though this book is dry reading, it is necessary reading. Why? Because in this day and age, when inroads are being made on individual rights across the world, it becomes necessary to ask ourselves, 'what would I choose to do in this situation?' I would hope that I would show the courage of the many Gentiles demonstrated in this book, regardless of the fact that my religions and beliefs differ from anyone involved in a move towards genocide regarding one group or one people. In the U.S. we have had this happen (regardless of those who would ignore our history)  with the Underground Railroad...but these persons were not threated with immediate death for protecting those of color.

Emma Howe is a 50 year old curmudgeon who cannot manage to keep employees. After reading this book, I can totally understand why no one wants to stick around!<br />This type of mystery, having to do with child pornography, is not my cup of tea...but you had no idea what you were getting into until the last third of the book. I was thinking adult pornography or maybe shipping of drugs in upholstered furniture, but was disgusted to find out where it ended up. <br />The plot was too forced, the characterization not up to my par at least, and the writing merely adequate.

Not many books have utilized Pittsburgh as the city involved in a mystery. At least not many I've read. It was great to recognize parts of the city, Ohio River Blvd which I travel almost every day, and many other sites used.<br />George is an excellent writer, and her plotting is phenomenal. She draws on every parent's nightmare, the kidnapping of an infant. In this case, the black market for babies is involved. The demand for a white, male infant is still large enough that people will do the wrong things in desperation, not realizing they are often participants in crimes. This is very well demonstrated through George's book. <br />I don't know exactly what it was about the characterization. Even though George gave a lot of information about the people, they never became three dimensional to me, hence the four stars instead of five stars. There were a lot of people to keep track of and perhaps that was part of the problem! Even the baby, who should have been described physically and personality-wise did not come across as real. <br />Another problem for me, as always, is the use of vile language. Yeah, I realize the author put it in for reasons of reality, but I still don't want to read it. Personal preference, but there are others out there who also want to be forewarned about the amount of disgusting language used in the book. There was not enough of it in this book to not read it. George may improve over time as per characterization. Hope so, she wrote a very interesting book otherwise...<br />Karen Sadler	2003-07-23

Okay, so Rita Mae indulged in her love of hunting a bit too much for some readers! I actually enjoyed learning about this, especially since I didn't know that in this country they merely chase the fox to his/her den, and try to avoid killing them. That was always the reason I avoided books on this in England, it seems an inhumane sport there on the line of cockfighting in this country. The interplay between the various animals always has me cracking up in Brown's novels. Since I have cats and dogs of my own, I am very aware they have personalities, and often consider us humans to be their pets rather than vice versa. I also remember long ago in biology they used to teach that we could not anthromorphize animals (give them human traits) like playing, but I've seen too many animals do things just for the plain fun of it rather than merely to eat and reproduce...another scientific fallacy hits the fan!<br />In this book, the mystery seemed more of a side plot, with the hunting information taking precedence. I am sure this is what other readers complained about. This was not a big enough flaw for me to avoid finishing the book, I actually got through it quickly because I enjoyed it. So it wasn't gory...big deal. The mystery dealt with an old cold case, that actually wasn't even a case, since no one knew what had happened to the people involved. One beautiful young woman disappears off the face of the earth, along with one of her boyfriends. Unfortunately, the inevitable change in ground and water levels, added to hunting and dogs digging brought up some old bones, proving to be human. <br />Sister, the head of the hunt in this area, may be older, but certainly has not lost either her riding/hunting abilities, or her concern for others. She's wise in the way we all hope we will age, losing our ability to hold grudges, finding forgiveness easier as we age, showing love when love and a kind touch are needed. She had me a bit worried at the end when she chased down the culprit of the murders, but everything worked out. <br />An enjoyable summer read.<br />Karen Sadler	2003-07-15

Ok, I read a little of the jacket...and no I didn't guess the culprit from the jacket, though by the time I was half-way through the book, I had a pretty good idea of who was the killer. The problem lay in the fact that this is a serial...and unlike some American serials I can think of which do a good short job of explaining the main characters who pop up in each segment of the serials, this particular writer, McGown, did not do that. So it took me a while to figure out who everyone was and whether they were good guys or bad guys. McGown needs to have a fast explanatory section of the beginning of each of her books or she is going to lose readers.<br />Having said that this was a good read, especially for light summer reading. Once I got into the book and understood who the characters were, I enjoyed the book immensely. McGown's two protagonists are nice people, the woman a cop who has just had a baby. I totally understand her feelings of wondering who this kid is and how she got here, and who is coming to pick her up. I think all women go through that to some extent and it is probably worse for women who establish a career first, before having a baby. Judy Hill's significant other, Lloyd, does a great job playing down Hill's fears and I love the fact he doesn't mind changing diapers. Most men do, though I got lucky, and my husband doesn't (even the second time around with grandchildren). <br />The story is another story about dysfunctional family with a few oddball twists and turns. It's not enough that children have families with no permanent ties to each other through marriage, but then to put an adopted child into the mix, and have fathers die or be kicked out by the mother...no wonder children have problems. A baby goes missing, a mother gets killed, other people get run over, and too many people have the blood of the victim on their clothes. A regular circus, with way too many possible suspects and actually too many different police units involved because thecrimes are all related.<br />I will most probably go back and read some of the earlier mysteries, now that I've found McGown. I enjoyed her writing. Not the best of British writing abilities, but certainly puts many American mystery writers to shame...<br />Karen Sadler	2003-07-11

Some of the other reviewers seem a bit frustrated with this book. I too, wait for Mallory to 'let someone in', which she seems so unable to do. Of course, given her childhood background...I'd probably react to human kindness the way she does. Mallory's been an enigma from the first book. She's solving crimes, but sometimes it's a debate whether the crime is more interesting, or Mallory is?<BR>A child forced to become an adult before she was ready, and who grows up in a precinct station in New York is hardly likely to be normal...<br />A serial murderer is loose on the blonde wanta-be-actresses of New York. This case is tied to a cold case from 20 years ago...and the serial murderer is doing a lot to try to get the attention of the cops. Mallory's friends and her coworker, Riker, are concerned, because as more information comes out concerning the 20-year old case...the suspect seems to have a haunted background and childhood suspiciously like Mallory's and they can't quit drawing parallels to her life. Why did her mind bend towards dealing with a her hard life in a certain way that put her within accepted societal mores, while this serial murderer is definitely asocial?<br />I really appreciate getting some new information concerning Mallory. She can keep being mysterious and aloof, but we, the readers, want to know more about what makes Mallory tick. <br />Only big problem I had with the book, is tying in the actress angle with the first murder...maybe I missed something. <br />Oh...and O'Connell introduces a new younger cop for Mallory to torture! Mallory's biggest parallel with the serial murderer is her inability to connect with those who care about her, including Charles, her very nonjudgemental friend who thinks he is too ugly for her...yet she doesn't even 'see' herself as beautiful. Wonder if this little dilemma will ever be resolved.<BR>This reader hopes so...yet worries that it will be unsatisfying if Mallory evernormalizes her relationships...<br />Karen Sadler	2003-07-05

I got started reading about the atrocities committed during WWII when I was in medical school and came across Henry Friedlander's book about The Medical Holocaust. I read several books on that, and then started reading military history of WWII. When I became more involved in a bioethics/disability group and started writing concerning this problem that persists today, I felt compelled to read more history about the original Nuremberg Trial, that set the legal precedent both for putting on trial war criminals and using the ideas of `crimes against humanity' as a means to prosecute these people.<br />Persico's book is probably one of the best in the historical genre. His writing is such that the book reads as quickly as a novel, but he doesn't speculate. He didn't have to, as there was so much information in writing, in photography, in video...that he could use the actual words of both the prosecution and the defendants. It not only flabbergasted the prosecution, but me as a reader to find that the Germans documented everything. It boggles the mind that these men and women who carried out such unbelievably horrible crimes, felt compelled to write about them. They were proud of what they did, and expected the world to actually laud them for their efforts to rid the world of the Jews and other minority groups. <br />It is so necessary that our children who are now three generations removed from The Holocaust be taught about the reality of what happened in Germany and the countries that Germany conquered (or tried to). What is so terrifying is the fact that many of these men were not charismatic, were not charming or handsome, had no great abilities of any kind, but in `normal' situations would have been merely cruel and lowly workers that no one would ever pay attention. The fact that one madman could pull into power a group of men like this (Goring among them), and threaten not only the world but their own people continues to be frightening. I see some politicians in power currently whose grasp for more power and seeks the destruction of many of the basic rights in our own democracy that parallel what happened in Germany. And unfortunately, too many of these people hold sway over other more intelligent men such as Albert Speer. I read about Speer's impact before, but still find it incredible that he could have ever listened to a raving madman and feel that his words held any credibility.<br />Persico writes well...I am forcing my husband to read this book because he was in Germany for two years, and I think he will find this fascinating, as I did. Persico brings up the fact that without the collaboration of industry, banks, and other corporate groups Hitler would never have retained power. These groups actively participated in the development of the Nazi killing machine, and Justice Jackson and the others involved in the criminal proceedings were right not only to bring the heads of these groups to task for their participation in the atrocities, but also to hold the entire proceeding within Germany itself, so as to allow it's people to see and have a say within the proceedings. This helped many Germans to come to an understanding of why and how this was allowed to happen in their country, and set the stage for the building of a democratic Germany.<br />Unfortunately, Justice Jackson's hope that the criminal proceedings would have an impact on future wars and other atrocities/genocides was misguided. I don't know if anyone ever stopped to think prior to committing crimes like these, that they could end up in court. Milosovec and other Serbs obviously didn't bother to consider this. However, Jackson's efforts did provide a precedent with which other war criminals have been tried, and with which the Serbs are now being tried.<br />An incredible book, an incredible story, an incredible writer.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2003-07-02

The last couple of Deaver's books disappointed me, but not this one. I enjoyed this mystery big time! Deaver was back to his original concise self, with fascinating characterization that makes his books so unique. Once again he brings back his protagonist, Lincoln Rhyme, who has such a large personality and intellect, that it mores than makes up for his 'disability' in being a quad. <br />This time Lincoln gets to be 'entertained' himself, in that he finds himself pitted against a villain who is a master practitioner in the arts of illusion and magic. Lincoln hates boredom, yet in this particular case he gets almost too much too handle. Not only is the reader introduced to novel information in these areas, but so is Rhyme, which makes it more difficult for him to logic his way out of this criminal mind. So many illusions are used, that Rhyme and his other allies (including a new female with background in magic), that it becomes difficult to tell what is the illusion and what is the reality.<br />Not only that, but this person manages to get past Rhyme's own watchful friends and bodyguards, and puts him at perceived risk. This only adds to the confusion of the entire case, and it becomes obvious from the very beginning that the master pulling the strings in this book is the criminal, and Lincoln has met his match.<br />Very quickly read book, very interesting and novel input from a world I know little about.<br />Karen Sadler	2003-07-01

It's a good thing that Mr. Lindsey is writing books, instead of coming up with ideas such as portrayed in this adventure/mystery novel...I'd hate to have him on the wrong side of the law. The book sounded interesting, and it was. The realization that so much of our nation's police forces, espionage, search and rescue groups, and politicians have their minds elsewhere, makes the premise of this book, someone coming in and threatening someone in the U.S. who has a corporation under him, very  plausible. Because of 9/11 and the various wars or problems in other nations our own nation is involved in, makes the possibility of someone using this as an opportunity frighteningly possible. I sure hope someone is paying attention to this possibility out there. <br />This story is very much more along the lines of a Tom Clancy book, but it is better written then the latest Tom Clancy books which are often relegated to other writers in 'his' group. This was a new author for me and I was very impressed with his writing, and his plotting. I had a bit of a difficult time keeping up with all the various people who were called in to do a single job, and then left. <br />I also knew right away, that the woman assistant was going to be targeted by the mastermind of this entire operation. In a situation such as thought up by this evil man, lives are not worth anything...and he will target those closest to the man he is manipulating. <br />The ending is not unexpected, but the idea of having to keep absolute silence about the reality behind two deaths because of possible national and international consequences is mind-boggling. To not even be able to talk out such horror with a psychologist/psychiatrist for fear of what might happen, and then live with the knowledge that someone killed two people you loved just to get to you...I think most people with a conscience would find it very difficult to do that...be totally silent.<br />A terrifying read...<br />Karen Sadler	2003-06-17
1092303:US	53067930	R2WO7UYLPHQFNS	1552976599	459064894	Written in Bones: How Human Remains Unlock the Secrets of the Dead	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Great addition to my science book collection!	Pictures. Pages and pages of nothing but glorious pictures, and maps, and photographs (along with the writing of course). For a deaf person who often has an opportunity to lend out science books to hearing and deaf kids, nothing is better than a science book chock full of illustrations and pictures to make sense of the words. This book is not really on forensic science, rather it is an anthropological book in which the history of human beings on this planet and in a variety of countries at different time periods lived. <br />Does it shock people that even from the earliest beginnings of mankind, the prediliction for war and fighting existed? Some of the pictures are shocking in that our 'civilization' views the religious ceremonies of other ancient civilizations as cruel and obscene from our point of view. And of course, they are, because we would never do such a thing as put a child at risk...right? If anyone believes that no one puts children at risk in modern society has not had contact with the pharmaceutical companies who are pushing to test drugs on children with no benefit to the children. But I digress....<br />Anthropology was not one of the sciences I got a lot of information in at college in biology and neuroscience. Yet it is interesting that some of the previously held views concerning brain capacity (size of the cranium) are being turned upside-down by findings in anthropology. I had no idea either that the Chinese also were as good at preserving bodies as the ancient Egyptians. I think the saddest parts of the whole book is the information on the 'bog bodies'. Life was cruel, and the inability of man to understand the cruelty of life often led to 'sacrifices' to appease the Gods of nature. <br />I probably wouldn't recommend giving this book out to immature kids below 10th grade. Like the other reviewer commented...some of the pictures and the information is very dark, and very morbid. For those mature teenagers interested in going into science, and specifically anthropology and archaeology, this is a great and fascinating book.	2003-06-11

You'd never guess from the title that the defense lawyer, Ben Kincaid, is going to be up to his neck in religious shenanigans...but he is. Unfortunately, in this case he is disappointed to find out how too fallible his religious guide/priest/whatever is. Bernhardt nicely involves a lot of different Christian denominations in this book...without saying anything nasty or prejudicial about them. <br />Many people might think the little extracurricular activities that Father Holbrook engages in and also gets his congregation to engage in is not likely to happen. Unfortunately, during the 70's it happened probably all too often. Our church did not have a building of it's own so we borrowed other churches buildings (when they would let us). One time, my mom went into the current building we were using and came out all flustered because we were going to have a children's meeting, and said we couldn't do it. I won't name the denomination, but let's just say the took the idea of 'sensitivity sessions' too far, and my modest mother who was the head of the children's organization had to wait outside and tell everyone to head home. Needless to say, we changed buildings after that! <br />So Bernhardt's idea isn't crazy, but it didn't make for enjoyable reading all the same. I was thrown off by who I thought was the villain of all the murders...I figured a certain somebody wanted his money sooner than later, and so had 'made arrangements.' <br />Bernhardt's information about how many times people are found guilty of a crime, and then when new information comes out, it doesn't necessarily exonerate them or let them out of prison because of the way the justice system worked took me by surprise. I knew that DNA was helping to free some wrongly accused. You'd have to live in Siberia, not to read about someone being let free because of sloppy or prejudicial police work. I didn't realize how bad it was, and will be interested in reading more concerning this issue.<br />The mystery wasokay...just wasn't a good topic and didn't pack the urgency or good writing I come to look for in my mysteries...<br />Karen SAdler	2003-06-09

This was my introduction to Tremayne's books. I am going to leave the jury out until I read a couple more of them. I think maybe this was not his best book for introducing to his series, and I don't like to make judgements about series with just one book (unless it is absolutely atrocious...and I've been wrong before!).<br />I have to admit the history of Ireland and the legal standing of women at this time period is absolutely fascinating. I'd never read anything concerning the history of Ireland this far back (into the early period of Christianity in Ireland). They certainly seemed to treat women with more respect back then prior to the changing of the legal system to coincide with the legal system of Rome and the Catholic Church. <br />The story got slow in some parts. Not boring, just slow. Seemed to take a bit of time to get to the point, and many times I made the connection in the murders and the involvement of a variety of religious personages...I am not real crazy about being right concerning who did what so early in the book.<br />However, I will read some other books from Tremayne. I do have to say for those who like mysteries without the accompanying bad language, violence, overwhelming sexual information that comes with more modern mystery series, these books are very safe that way. The history is absolutely well researched and that I admire. Part of the reason I will continue to read some of Tremayne's books is just to get that historical information. It's fascinating.<br />Karen SAdler	2003-06-09

When I read The Origins of Nazi Genocide, which came out in 1995, the author referred to this original book concerning the physicians and scientists who had exploited the 'situation' in Germany to their own ends. I had also come across references to this book in many, many professional papers...yet, made the stupid decision that I didn't need to read it. I finally decided I had to read this when my advisor in science education recommended it because he was using it in teaching bioethics to science teachers.<br />Though Friedlander's book is excellent, and was my introduction to The Medical Holocaust (especially as concerned the disabled) Lifton's book goes much further and deals with the physician/scientists within the concentration camps as well as in the psychiatric institutions which became involved in the killing machinery of the Nazis. Lifton's book explores the rationalizations made by these men to take advantage of a situation to experiment on those who could not give informed consent. Though Lifton tends to make a few speculations concerning motives from his interviews with physicians who were not prosecuted or were absolved of their involvement in these camps...his speculations are on target (mostly) and he backs up his statements with the words of these doctors from letters and interviews with those people who had the most to do with them: the prisoner physicians forced to work in these environments not only to save their own lives, but the lives of so many others.<br />Of course, more information is in this book concerning the atrocities. Sometimes, I had to put the book down and leave it for a while because the information is so horrendous. It is so beyond belief that so many physicians could rationalize the experimentation, using a statement I've grown to recognize in legal documents and even in newspapers in the U.S. ('for the good of society'). I just cringe now when I see this or sentences like this. Science should never replace the rights of the individuals. And scientists are never objective...they have the same prejudices and biases that society has and it permeates their work...to the point of biasing the information they find.<br />My only complaint about Lifton's book is occasional repetition or dwelling on certain topics/agendas.

Dealing with the period of change that occurred after Henry VIII cut the English church off from the Catholic church, this mystery dealt with his heavy-handed breakup of the monastaries (and nunneries) through his minion, Cromwell. This confusing time for all of Britain, was acclaimed by some, hated by others, and was the typical politically-rife antagonisms between two groups, that we are all too familiar with at present. What was different back then, was if you disagreed with the wrong group, you could end up with no head! Both Cromwell and the king had their own agendas, and the people who worked under either of them did so precariously, never knowing what these two strong personalities were going to be like from day to day.<br />Into this mess comes a commissioner/lawyer of Cromwell's with lofty views of change he expected to come with the dissolution of the Catholic church in England. As in most time periods, there were good and bad institutions, and it was the same in this time period. The monastaries had become rich and lazy, and had lost their priorities to God and to charitable acts. Unfortunately, it becomes all too clear to Shardlake, the commissioner, that the world replacing the one Cromwell was in the act of destroying, was not going to be significantly different. The king wanted the monasteries riches and lands, and Cromwell himself used the dissolutions to reward those doing his bidding. This had to be deeply disappointing for those who were seeking a true religious change, starting with the publishing of the Bible in English for the first time...which directly led to people becoming more literate (as they wanted to read the Bible on their own). <br />Shardlake comes to a monastery that includes both good and bad men. A murder is done there of a previous commisioner and Shardlake is sent by Cromwell to do two things; determine who murdered the other commissioner, and get the abbot tosign a dissolution agreement (in exchange for pensions). Sounds a bit like Enron.<br />The writing is mixed. A bit repetitive, takes a bit to long to get to the point. Sansom does give a good description of the darkness of the period, and the mixed feelings of the people in England towards all this change in which they had little or no say. Makes you sincerely glad you didn't live in those times.<br />Karen Sadler	2003-05-29

Her background into the real world of violent sex crimes is usually a field that make me extremely uncomfortable. But Fairstein does a good job in explaining the reality of that world without dwelling on it unnecessarily. Thank you for that.<br />This particular novel deals with the seamy side of the art world. I knew it existed from reading nonfiction on it, as well as other mysteries dealing with it--it seems to be a popular subject at the moment. Is it happening more often, or are we just more aware of it? The plot basically boils down to the fact that certain art has been stolen and missing for over ten years. The person found murdered originally may possibly have had some connection to the resurfacing of this artwork. Then Mike and Alex (the ADA) take it from there.<br />I got a kick out of some of the background into both the art world (the propensity to cover up valuable paintings/illuminated manuscripts seems to be a real problem) and also into the information concerning the railway system in New York. I've been reading the nonfiction book \\"Gangs of New York\\" so this information played into the understanding I got from that book. To me, the more well-written history in a mystery...the better I like it.<br />This book got a little confusing after a while. Too many people, too many paintings to keep track of. My favorite parts of the book deal with Alex's coworkers, especially Mike who reminds me greatly of one of my mentors in my HIV lab, who was also a practical joke player and wisecracker. This deep detail into characterization always pleases me with mysteries or any book. It is part of what make a good book come alive. This book was more 'alive' then others I've read recently because of good characterization, but the plot line was a little obtuse. Anyway, it was a fun read...<br />Karen Sadler	2003-05-21

When I came online to write a review about this book, I decided to read more from the other reviewers first. Maybe that isn't such a hot idea, because it will influence your own reviews...but for some reason this book just didn't catch my attention like Deaver's other books on Lincoln Rhymes. No...it's not just because Lincoln is disabled, no matter what people think about my slightly biased views because I am deaf. <BR>Even though the book was enjoyable, there was a slightly false 'air' to it. After reading the reviews of the many computer geeks (no offense intended since I admire them) and those in the know in the computer world, I think I understand why the mystery came off this way. No amount of research can make up for the basic characterization, and a decent plotline. In this book, the plot was okay, but the characters came across as cardboard dummies. Very little emotional involvement attached to them. Another major problem, is having some computer background myself, like the other reviewers said the information concerning computers seemed contrived. I didn't realize it went so far as to include 'made up words' not used within computer geekdom. To me that is bad precedent for the basis of a novel. Deaver should have at least checked with those involved in that world first before writing this stuff into his mystery.<br />Having said that...Deaver is one of the better mystery writers today for the most part. The plot was good and the book could have been written better. Did anyone else get the idea that this was written along the lines of a script for a movie or TV show? I know the one movie they did using one of Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme novels was not a hit, but please...those of us who enjoy reading mysteries do not want to read scripts! This is a very light, enjoyable read, especially if it's a first time exposure to Deaver or a summer beach book.<br />Karen Sadler	2003-05-21

I was browsing in the mysteries section and came across this book. While reading it, I kept thinking, 'how did this book end up in that section?' It's not that there is not a mystery to the book, there is a good plotline concerning a lost masterpiece of handworked writing of early books made by monks usually, who illuminated their writings. This particular book was a secular (nonreligious) one, but still very valuable due to the age and the type of gilding and jewels used on and in the book.<br />After finishing the book, which in spite of it being more a romance book then a mystery, I enjoyed a lot...I am still confused. Other than the age of the book, the fact that it was one of a kind, and the fact that the female protagonist found out information about her family someone didn't want her to know (I don't want to give it away)...what was the big deal over the book? A bunch of people died to keep the book from turning up again, and I am still not quite sure what the big deal was. Maybe I read it too fast!<br />Anyway, it's not my usual reading matter, but it was pretty good fun. The love story is nice, with a bit of history and magic woven into the story. I could do without the graphic descriptions, but that's my own personal preference.<br />Lowell is not the best writer I've come across, obviously, because so much is left unexplained, too many loose ends. I really enjoyed the history and the information about this type of book...I've certainly never come across vocabulary such as pampliset before.

I was raised in Contra Costa County to the east of San Francisco. And of course, we went through state history while in grade school. But not once were we told about the Plague, though we heard plenty about the earthquake and the San Andreas faultline. It came as a complete surprise to me that SF had experienced one more trauma during that decade from 1900-1910...they did not just experience the plague once, but rather a series of them. I guess with all the shipping that SF used to be known for, much of it coming from the Orient, it should not have been so unusual. Much of the area that this happened in has changed drastically over the years, including Chinatown, but I still remember going to Chinatown in the 1960s and seeing butcher shops with dead ducks hanging in the windows. <br />Most cities had problems with rats. If they thought SF was bad, I hate to think what Chicago was like with that city being the major one for slaughterhouses throughout the U.S., and of course, NY with all the shipping from around the world. What made SF unique is that it was relatively smaller to both NY and Chicago, and considered a clean city. I guess even after 60 years, the area was still embarrassed by their run-in with the plague and that's why we didn't get that information in school.<br />I love medical history, and we have several very good authors out there, with the late Roy Porter and Laurie Garret being a couple of favorites. Chase's book was alright, but did not have the writing ability of the above authors, and the book seemed dry, and very repititious at times. She obviously did her research, to the point of having the names of so many of the Chinese who died in the first wave of plague. The book just lack the feeling of urgency conveyed by other authors when dealing with epidemics. <br />It was a good enough book, and maybe as Chase writes more books, she'll learn to not to write as a reporter (which she is) and to develop the ability to make history of any kind exciting without having to 'make up' historical facts. Probably the best part of the book was the political and racial biases against the Chinese (again). I felt bad for their continued fight against prejudices, when they had done so much to build the West. <br />Karen Sadler.<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2003-05-12

Not only is Anna Pigeon a bit more 'identifiable-with' for us normal folk, but the information she gives so lovingly about the Parks and the history surrounding them makes the reader as if she/he is not wasting their time. Somehow we always learn something new, we didn't know before, and I like that in an author. <br />Once again, this book takes places in the Deep South. The ability of Barr to use words to draw and color the areas in which the mysteries take place is one of the great things about her writing. She doesn't have to go into long explanations or use big words to get across the local flavor, the prejudices (of everyone!), even the time of year is so well drawn you can almost smell the time after the leaves have fallen and just before the winter sleep. Since this is a favorite time of year for me, that description alone was worth the read.<br />Anna gets herself into a situation, one that is confusing for her where she has a strange murder that seems 'set-up- but also then immediately runs into some 'good-ole'-boys' who chase her in order to keep their hunting rights on Federal property (or so she thinks at first). Eventually, the story ties everything in...and I have been waiting for her nasty under-ranger (with a hilarious name) Thigpen to show his true colors. I knew from the moment she first described him a few books ago, that he was so prejudiced against women in what he considered a 'man's job' that one way or another, he would try to 'get' Anna for taking the position he coveted (and not the position he earned...too lazy for that).<br />Once again, a very enjoyable read. The history of the slaves and stories about the freemen is something I very much want to know more about, especially as geneaology is an important topic to me. I cannot imagine trying to do geneaological research in an environment where families were torn apart, graveyards are not marked in recognizeable forms, historical documents would have to be searched through carefully to find slight bits of information, and many times slaves took the last names of their owners (tho heaven only knows why). This is the new and interesting information that really excites me when I read Barr's books. Maybe that same information will excite some people into doing more historical and geneaological research down in the Deep South, so families can be 'reunited'.<br />Karen Sadler	2003-04-21
1155182:US	53067930	R40QLN2YQEJL4	0871138301	11509057	Scourge: The Once and Future Threat of Smallpox	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Different viewpoint of the same problem.	I just recently finish Preston's book 'The Demon in the Freezer'. You would think that would fulfill my appetite for knowledge concerning smallpox, right? But that particular book and this one, Scourge, are very different. While Preston writes for the masses, often in a very novelistic, suspenseful way to bring information concerning microbial dangers to everyone, this particular book is more for those whose interests and avocations and jobs lie in these fields. This does not mean the book is written boringly. Both books deserved the five stars for different reasons. 'Demon...' was exciting and horrifying in it's details concerning smallpox, this book brings to life the unfortunate politics played behind the scenes by physicians, by government entities such as the Defense Department, by politicians who do not understand the full implications of most biological and bioethical discussions, by entire countries (U.S. and Russia the worst as per usual). <br />Though Tucker and Preston mention a few names and incidents in common in their books, their writing is very different. Tucker is deeply involved in bioweapons development as a member of an elite group that monitors this type of problem internationally. Preston writes like a journalist. So the impact of their writing is completely different and I personally think anyone interested in this problem is well-served by reading both books.<br />Scourge tells the story of the political problems not only in eradicating the smallpox worldwide, but the current problem concerning the existence of stocks at the CDC and VEctor, and whether they should be destroyed. Tucker goes into far more detail concerning the problems in India and Bangladesh that made that country one of the last to contain smallpox (and bodes ill should smallpox ever raises its head there again). He also goes into much more detail concerning Russia's two-faced behavior in supplying the world with the vaccine that led to eradication, but in secret continuing to work on smallpox and genetic variations in order to have them for biological weaponry.<br />Tucker also gives a good warning at the end chapter, that while the ability to use smallpox as a weapon is more difficult then imagined, the possibility of using it still exists. He emphasizes that panic does not contribute anything useful, but awareness and preparation for the possibility does. I am glad that the smallpox vaccinations are there, and I think more physicians and other medical personnel should be prepared for seeing these cases, and being able to differentiate between smallpox, flu, and chickenpox.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education	2003-04-17

It's so incredibly frustrating when someone who is known to be a good writer turns out such a tortuous and disconnected book as this one turned out to be. Cornwell obviously did the research, but the blasted book reads like a notebook of oddball notes she wrote to herself while doing the research, rather than in organized chapters presented in such a way as to make her case. She really should have known better than this.<br />That is not to say that the information is not interesting, or that she could have made the case after this many years that this guy (if you can call him that) actually was the Ripper. The information seems to be there...what was the problem? A chapter on this guy's background and family, a chapter on his possible medical problems and the agony that must have accompanied it. A chapter on his wife and her family, a chapter on his presence in London during those times. A chapter on the massive amount of writing he did, and the comparisons between his writing and the Ripper's writings. A chapter on the possible victims elsewhere in England, and speculation of grisly finds on the Continent. This type of order would have made this book so much better.<br />As it was, Cornwell seem to be writing in disassociated thought, which may be great for poetry, but is not a good methodology for history. Even if she was in a rush to get this book out before someone else, the publisher didn't bother to bring up the collosal disorganization of this book? <br />A mortifying disappointment...this book goes to the library.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science education	2003-04-15
1160002:US	53067930	RIAQLKQF9TNNL	1585421359	648912217	The Fasting Girl: A True Victorian Medical Mystery	Books	5	6	6	N	N	An ample dose of Victorian America...	This was a very different book...with different meaning in a good way. Stacey did a tremendous amount of research into both the family of Mollie Fancher, and the times in which she lived. Just as in a hundred years when people read about the predominance of anorexia nervosa, they will not totally understand the mechanisms and stressors behind girls of our time literally starving themselves to death...we cannot possibly understand the workings of Mollie Fancher's decisions to alter the controls of her own life without understanding the immense pressures she was under. There is this prevailing concept now that things were 'easier in the good old days' because our own world is so complex and often so violent. Yet, we too quickly forget that the 'old days' including frequent deaths by bear children, terrible diseases that took the lives of children who lived past the first year and adults, crowded and polluted conditions in cities, and total lack of respect for women as shown in how little say they had in their own lives.<br />Mollie had experienced almost all of these things by the time she reached sixteen. From a middle class family, she lost her mother early to childbirth, she had lost brothers/sisters to disease, her father remarried and abandoned the original family (which seemed to happen a lot according to my eugenics research), Mollie was fast approaching the age where she would be required to leave school, and marry and have children. The final straw was getting her long skirts entangled in a street car upon leaving it, and getting dragged for a long period of time.<br />Stacey makes it clear that the decisions Mollie made to remain bedridden were probably not consciously overt decisions. Mollie must have retained a phobia concerning childbirth after seeing what it did to her beloved mother, and she was given a pretty good education only to be expected to submerge that education and her independence upon marriage. By choosing to invalid herself, she managed to retain some control over her own life...but at costs not only to others like her family who had to take care of her, but also to herself. Mollie was not a traditional anorexic as we are familiar with all too well these days. She may have gone through an early stage of fasting and food avoidance, but her invalidism did not have a significant effect on her length of life. Her photos look like she was fairly well-fed and at middle life, was heavy as so many of us women get. The mystery in this book is not concerned as much with the claim by others mainly that she lived on relatively little food. She may have not eaten a lot, but being bed-ridden with no exercise would certainly not have demanded that she eat a lot to retain a decent figure of health. The real mystery has to do with the reaction of society towards Mollie, the scientists who fought to prove she was a 'fake' though she was relatively uninterested in celebrity, and the absolute fascination that the press and society with Mollie's abilities and her problems.<br />That Mollie was fooling herself is discernible in Stacey's fine writing. That others allowed Mollie's sure belief in herself to close their own eyes to reality is also obvious. As usual, scientists (usually minor ones too) were quick to jump on any available media soapbox to promote their own 'scientific' ideas against any possible spiritual reason for Mollie's continued existence. Not much has changed in 140 years. Scientists are still jumping on any available media soapbox to promote their ideas...and the quacks with their speculations, unproven theories, risky practices, and self-conceit are all around us again (including some Nobel prize winners who make ridiculous statements to the press!).<br />I found the history of all this incredibly fascinating. Stacey wandered a bit from Mollie's story, yet the wanderings were interesting and added to the general understanding of Mollie's frame of mind, as well as that of the scientists and her own rabidsupporters. One thing this book does it make you look at  your own beliefs and prejudices to see if they hold up under inspection.<br />I remember 'hearing' that anorexics were using food as both an attention-getter and as a power struggle within the family and society. To an extent, I think the power theory has validation, but I no longer believe that these girls (and occasionally men) do this as an attention getter. They are actually the opposite...sneaky, trying to avoid eating at all costs, using any means to void the body of nutritional benefit. These people truly do not understand after a certain point their own self-destructive behavior. Though Mollie may not have been a traditional anorexic, she also did not totally understand her own unconscious decisions...because in letters and statements she had made to others it is clear she 'missed' being able to do certain things.

Barr really did a good job on this particular book. As other reviewers have said, it's nice to see her back on target with her books.  What made this particular book so interesting is the background of this park, which I never even knew existed! It's a fortress built about 70 miles out in the Gulf of Mexico from Florida. Originally built to serve military purposes during the Civil War, but the war ended and so it's purpose was changed from a prison to house POWs from the Southern side, to house other more famous prisoners, including some of the men purported to have involvement in the killing of President Lincoln, including the doctor who set the leg of of Lincoln's assasin.<br />As someone who is very into geneaology, history, old letters, and Lincoln because of being related to him by way of his wife, Mary Todd, this was an incredible historical find, and Barr has whetted my appetite to find out more about Dry Tortugas National park. It's definitely a place I want to visit.<br />Anna Pigeon is as usual being her own worse enemy. No wonder she likes cats so much...her own curiousity and lack of fear get her into many of her scrapes. All to the good in this story, where she has to save not only herself and her friends in the park, but also rescue illegal immigrants from being slaughtered and taken advantage of. More examples of man's inhumanity to men...like we really need any more.<br />Anna does finally learn to stop running away from another commitment to a good man because of what happened in her first marriage (her husband was killed in an accident in the first year or so).<br />This book was a fast read, three evenings in spite of dissertation work. I hope to see more from Barr. She seems to have gotten a second wind, which is rare in series. As always the descriptions of the parks are phenomenal, as Barr knows what she is talking about.<br />Karen Sadler	2003-04-03

I don't usually pick up real crime stories. I enjoy forensic science mysteries, but the evil that men do to others in our world I get enough of just from reading history and bioethics, let alone reading true crime stuff. Yet in reading about this book, I got the feeling it was more a case study done in history than a true crime book as typically seen today that exploits the pain of others, who are often still living, in order to make money. I abhor that and won't purchase books like that.<br />Anyway, Ruddick did a phenomenal job of case study and research into this crime. I can see why it was so fascinating. Because it happened over 100 years ago, the impact on the families involved have lessened over time. Though many of them bare scars in the families (usually economical), those involved are long dead and the stigma of the situation has receded from social memory.<br />I have read a lot on the Victorian age, and have done quite a bit of research on this time period as concerns the disabled and deaf in the United States. In doing this, you come across all the different mores of society that were held before the turn of the twentieth century. Women were trapped into their marriages literally by legal boundaries and societal mores, and the fact that men could be abusive in any way possible made no difference to society. The woman was expected to subject herself to anything her husband would dish out, things that in this day and age would get him arrested, and certainly would provide the means for a divorce with no stigma attached to a woman for doing this. Spousal abuse would also allow the woman to take her children with her, to avoid putting them in a position of taking her place in the abusive cycle. Back then, the women were given no choices in anything, and Ruddick is very fair in explaining this after he solves the mystery. <br />Ruddick does pretty much solve the mystery to my satisfaction, in that he handles it as a case study, and though there is no 'smoking gun' (after all this time, there wouldn't be) there is certainly enough written, archived information to allow a professional researcher into this area to say 'this is probably what happened'...and have that decision stand on its own. I think if this case were tried in court today, they would find the same conclusion as Ruddick did. What is different today is that the murderer would have been sentenced differently under today's laws and understandings of the cycle of abuse and fear, whereas the guilty party back then would have been either in jail for the rest of their lives, or would have hung. As it was the guilty party lived only shortly after the murder, and this was probably partly from guilt and partly from the physical abuse suffered at the hands of the man who was murdered (and other earlier abuse from another man). <br />A truly well-researched, well thought out conclusion to a long-lasting mystery...<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2003-03-28

Her ability to keep the reader on the edge of their seat is outstanding. Her characters are drawn well enough, and I cannot tell you if her characterization of the deep South is true (all I know is I don't want to visit or live there!), but it certainly seems dark and full of undercurrents of emotion due to many factors including prejudice against race and gender. <br />Hoag chooses to write mainly about things that tend to make one uncomfortable...children being abducted, women being raped. Our worse nightmares in a book. I usually tend to stay away from this type of mystery/novel, because of it's topic. It's probably been at least four years since I read one of Hoag's books because of this. <br />My major complaints are two-fold. First off, if a woman (or a man) is smart enough, savvy enough, strong enough to pass police and civil service exams, I had supposed they be smart enough to be suspicious of everyone...maybe that's just me. As a deaf person, we usually are suspicious of everyone until we really get to know them. But Annie Broussard accepts a cup of coffee from the mother of their chief suspect, and Mom is a few bricks shy of a load herself. I always think, if a person is strange that his/her parents had something to do with their strangeness (and this isn't always right, but it's a pretty good rule psychologically). Too many strings were left after the culprit had been found, including answers as to the behavior of the other cops who made Broussard's life miserable. <br />Second, I am extremely thankful I cannot hear if this is the way the real world 'talks'. I suppose like in the Navy where my Grandfather was an engineer, cops too tend to use expletives all the time. I just don't want to hear it, and don't really want to read it.<br />So though Hoag is a great writer, and this is a pretty good book, I will probably go for another four years without reading one of her books. Just personal preference. My mother always saidpeople who use expletives like that are not very intelligent...they can't carry on a decent conversation without filling it with those types of words, so they must not have anything important to say. I'm inclined to believe her...<br />Karen Sadler	2003-03-25

Preston did us all a huge favor years ago when he wrote The Hot Zone. Not because it became a bestseller, but because he brought to the forefront of mainstream America the fact that we are walking a very narrow, slim line in our efforts to dominate the world. In the Hot Zone he discussed the impact of continued intrusion into the dark forests of Africa, both from the natives of that vasst land and by our 'corporations' and even our universities, who recklessly send for monkeys, chimps, and apes (and ruin their habitats) in the name of science and progress. In doing so we expose ourselves to viral invaders, who were latent and quiet, merely waiting for a host species to do something stupid, which we so obviously did. In that book, it was Ebola in Reston, Virginia...<br />In this book, it is smallpox on an international basis. Preston threw me into confusion with his initial opening chapter on the anthrax fiasco after 9/11. I thought in picking up this book it was sure to be on the supposedly two remain 'stocks' of small pox, known to exist...one at the CDC in ATlanta, and the other in Russia. Yet, the story of the murderous use of anthrax (by whomever), has a tie-in with the small pox story of the last thirty years. AS is so obvious the case by now as we enter into yet another war with Iraq, the mere signing of a treaty does not guarantee that those who sign the treaty will obey the rules of that said treaty. Russia most assuredly did not keep her hands off the smallpox entrusted to her, but proceeded to develop bioweapons, at the same time she was supplying the rest of the world with smallpox vaccine. I suppose that was their way of not only throwing us 'off the scent' but perhaps to condone their behavior in scientifically creating weapons of mass destruction. The United States is not blameless either.<br />What Preston so horrifyingly makes clear in this short concise book, is that the 'cat is out of the bag'. Those of us who worked in science have known that fora while, yet much of the information in Preston's articulate book was new to me. What is more important is that Preston is a writer who makes complex science exceedingly clear, even to a layperson with no background or no interest in science.  It is his writings and those of Garrett, that have alerted U.S. society, that it is no longer to our benefit to remain ignorant of the scientific age in which we live. We must become involved, we must make decisions that impact the decisions made in Washington, DC. That means exercising our democratic rights to vote those out who would continue to play 'with the demons in the freezers' whatever those demons are. If it had been left up to me, I would have fried those vials of smallpox in the 70's. No possible good can ever come from evil...how often must that be stated before people will understand it.<br />Preston is a more concise writer than he was when he wrote The Hot Zone. This is an incredibly short book on a large topic, but he gets the necessary information across. As a mother and a grandmother, my hackles raise when I hear scientists saying we must keep those viral stocks of smallpox to be able to obtain scientific information from them. The only information that will come from the use of those stocks, may lead to the demise of the human race...and we are currently facing that possibility and teeter on the edge of oblivion because of the scientific curiosity and pride of a few arrogant scientists.<br />Preston raises one significant point that needs to be answered. Why has there yet to be a Nobel Prize awarded to the many men and women still alive who worked so hard (and at personal cost) to eradicate the one disease we have managed to completely control? I see Nobel's given for less important reasons, and certainly for less compassionate service. Perhaps that is a new Nobel to be created, for those who go above and beyond in compassionate service of mankind. These are those who stand in direct contradiction to thosewho practice 'man's inhumanity to man' which continues to ravish our world. Let their light so shine, that their light may diminish the darkness our world is plunging into...<br />A courageous story done by courageous people, told by a courageous man.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2003-03-18

Oh well, another female protagonist bites the dust! Meaning their author is struggling to keep up the interest and enthusiasm way too far into the genre. Don't get me wrong, Muller is better at this stuff then many, even this far into her series. I enjoy the characterizations she does, and I especially enjoy getting reacquainted with my native home, the San Francisco Bay Area, which I have not seen for at least seventeen years. I had no idea the stupid double-decker highway around the Embarcadaro had pancaked during the 1989 earthquake and that they razed it. I thought it was ugly when they put it up way back when in the 70's, and it most assuredly ruined the waterfront view! Maybe someone learned something that time around...I sure hope so, since my father would normally have been on the Bay Bridge during the time of the quake, coming home...and on the bottom deck. One of the many reasons California is a good place to visit, but not live...<br />The downfall of the high tech industry that took California and the nation by an economic storm, and then left everyone broke makes it way into Sharon McCone's life via a suicide. In the process of solving the mystery of why this young man committed suicide, she struggles to come to terms with a family suicide. Very few people see these things coming, it's only in hindsight we recognize the symptoms. Muller deals carefully with this topic, because the reasons for suicides abound, and the impact on remaining family members is always profound.<br />Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't automatically know who was the 'one'. It didn't particularly catch me by surprise either, but the read was a decent 'mind-reliever-book', in a particularly stressful week. I would suggest that Muller, like many of the other women who start successful mystery series needs to take a break from this one, toy with another series or even a nonfiction book. I think it becomes difficult to retain interest in your own creations after a while, and unfortunately sometimes it shows in the books. <br />Predictable...maybe. Worth the time if looking for light reading...yes.<br />Karen SAdler	2003-03-15

As a child who read every book on myths, fairy tales, fantasy stories, etc. that I could get my hands on, I always wondered about the story of the Pied Piper. I remember the one old movie where it shows the mountains parting, and the Piper taking the children into the mountain. Inside there was some type of wonderful land for the children that catered to their every whim (from what we could see). As the mountain closed, a young boy who was crippled and hobbled on a stick, came hurrying up, just missing a chance to go into this 'land'. I always felt sorry for that young man because I identified with him. Part of the reason I read fairy tales was to get away from my real world, the world in which I am deaf and was required to go to public schools in California in the 1960's and 70's, where no one wanted me: not the administrations, not the teachers and certainly not the kids. My home was my safe place, and my books were my television since I could not hear the cartoons or shows and they were not captioned at that time.<br />I also felt extremely sorry for the parents, losing all their children that way, because of the dishonesty of the politicians (as per usual). How great of Richardson to finish the story off for us, and this is one of those books you are thinking \\"I wish I had thought of that!\\"<br />This book is an incredible read. Well written, thoughtful, it's almost too good for small children, but I could see reading this book to them after reading about the Pied Piper. As a parent reads, they could explain thing and answer questions. But really this book is for old kids, the 'tween' group who are not quite ready for the teenagers currently available kind-of-... reading out there. It's also a great fantasy book. It totally turned on its head my previous conceptions of dragons...like the assumptions we make about other people and other cultures, Richardson's dragon skips rope and faints at the slightest thing. <br />The protagonist, Penelope, I could readily identify with. At eleven she loses her hearing, and she and her parents are devastated. But like the wise old man of Hamelin (there is always a wise old man or woman in these stories) said, nothing ever happens except for a reason. We may not always agree with the need for the bad things to happen, we may not always understand why they happen, but often the reason for our problems becomes clearer as we live life and experience it. This is an excellent book to illustrate that concept to children, teenagers, and adults. I never understood 'why' I had to be deaf, 'why' I went to a regular school instead of a residential school, 'why' I had to deal with prejudices and barriers...and now, I am a disability rights advocate and I work to protect those with disabilities in education and health through my bioethics/disability groups. So see...the stories often come true, or have a realistic bent to their parables...<br />And best of all, that nasty Pied Piper got what was coming to him!<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2003-03-12

This is the second book of Fairstein that I have read. I really enjoyed the first one, which was a more current book. I can tell her skills are sharpening as she continues to write, and I hope she doesn't end up like so many female mystery writers do, and run out out of ideas and enthusiasm for her protagonist. <br />Since Fairstein is writing about what she knows, it helps significantly in making the 'cases' seem very real and very significant. I am usually a little relunctant to pick up books about sex crimes, I don't like to see them on television or movies. I know they happen, but it just makes me very uncomfortable. But, Fairstein doesn't need to dwell on that part of the crime...she states what happens and moves onto the solving of the crime as the main part of the book. I like that in a writer.<br />One thing that bugs me a bit in both these books, and in many female authors of this genre...is why do the supposedly intelligent women in these books place themselves in conditions that could be dangerous. Now to be fair, in the last book I read, there was no warning of what was going to happen. But this time, even before Cooper goes to the apartment alone, I'm saying in my head \\"Don't be stupid and go some place without your backups...\\" I mean come on, anyone with a somewhat intelligent brain would realize that going to the person's apartment (who was killed) on your own is asking for problems, especially when there is a good indication that the person responsible for the crime is getting nervous, and I would think there would be rules in any of the agencies involved in this type of work, that no one goes anywhere without a partner. It only makes sense to me.<br />Now Cooper does get herself out of her own mess, which a lot of lady protagonists do, but I always wonder, don't these ladies ever learn anything from their mistakes? I'd like to see her rather charming partner get into trouble by doing something stupid for a change. <br />Anyway, Fairstein is an enjoyable read, and I definitely plan on continuing to get her books. <br />Karen Sadler	2003-03-10

Yet this obviously major first book on early forensic science turned out to be a 'snort of laughter' funny book. It's a very wryly written and very wise autobiography, with no backstabbing or self-congratulatory remarks. If anything, Smith was way too modest, in dealing with the many parts of forensic science (which are now dealt with by different departments in police, FBI, etc). He managed to deal with ballistic forensics, stringing a couple of microscopes together while in Eqypt in order to compare bullets and casings. This was way prior to the invention of comparison microscopes that are regularly used even in med school. <br />The stories he tells are usually not well-known, but he had a good reason for sharing the story because it showed a particular means of solving a crime (or not solving it) using what they had available in forensics during the early 1900's. Smith imagination and ability to 'make do' are something that is badly missed in most sciences today. He certainly lived a very productive and valuable life, and obviously his inventions and unique ideas have been built upon in forensic science. I think he would not be surprised, but would have enjoyed the other newer fields in forensics such as entymology. <br />This is an older book, found at my university library. Quite frankly, it would be worthwhile to publish again and recommend to the many people who are showing such an interest in forensics due to shows such as CSI. Many of the concepts Smith teaches are still valuable today. If readers cannot buy this book, try to find it at a university libary. It is extremely well-written and enjoyable.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2003-03-04

I am really torn with this book...it's not my usual reading genre for enjoyment, but I had read the book Benson wrote after this one and really liked it. I've read sci fi books in the past and while I enjoyed classics like Bradbury, I often found good writers few and far between. Adventures books have not been a genre I choose to read. But since I was in medical school and really enjoyed studying viruses. The nasty little buggers have a real tendency to one-up us all the time, so the idea that there would be catastrophic outbreaks is not all that far-fetched. Our world has grown significantly smaller due to airplane transportation, and the large boats which come from third world countries with shipments that often bring mosquitos into the U.S. and other countries which are not native to our lands. Some of the current 'hot' viruses act quickly with no previous display of symptoms that would make persons stand back or avoid situations, and because of closed circulated air in planes, a respiratory virus is very easily circulated among passengers. Scary, huh?<br />She also brings up a world that is fast falling on us in which individual rights are cast aside for the good of society as a whole. We've seen this nationalistic bent before, both in Nazi Germany and in our own country at a variety of times, including right now. Sometimes we need to be reminded of FDR's statement that the only thing we have to fear, is fear itself. When society becomes so afraid, of disease, of differences, etc. then we become the most dangerous to our own selves. Benson is apt at bring this up, with the presence of Biocops who make a determination that someone is dangerous on the basis of being in a building that shows the presence of dangerous viruses in only one small section of a building, and they shoot a perfectly healthy man. Someone who just happened to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time. That is to me even more scary then our invisible enemies, viruses.<br />Benson is a thoughtful, literate, well-researched writer. Just because she originally sold beads does not mean she doesn't have other talents. Is this the best book I've ever read? Probably not, but it's the fastest one I've read in a while...two days flat with work and school. As far as adventure books go, this is a definite possibility  for a movie I think. I am looking forward to reading more from Benson hopefully along this story line. <br />Karen L. Sadler, Science Education	2003-02-25

I actually spotted the view of the smallpox hospital and that's what made me pick the book up. I have been researching hospitals and institutions, any place where deaf people could have been sent just for being deaf in the U.S. (from about 1850 through the 1940's). So I often come across pictures, photographs, etc. of these haunting places. This was obviously a fiction, but I enjoyed the information concerning these islands and their institutions in New York. Incredibly amazing on several fronts. First off, we sure take our freedoms for granted now...back then, no one had freedoms except the very wealthy and powerful. Even if they committed heinous crimes, they could live in fairly splendiforous means with lower class criminals providing slave labor. Second, it's incredible that so many of these places were architecturally magnificent. Did their architects even consider what these places were going to be used for? What was the purpose of making a place that beautiful, where people were sent to die of infectious diseases? Kind of odd if you ask me!<br />I enjoyed the books protoganist, Alex Cooper, though I get a bit uncomfortable with stories having to do with sexual crimes if it is overdone as a means to sell books. I don't think Fairstein is guilty of this and I will most probably pick up another one of her books, because I liked this one. I enjoyed the sense of friendship between Cooper and the cop...they truly enjoy one another's company purely as friends, and they complement each others strengths and weaknesses. I've had a couple of friends like that, both at work and in my interpreters, so I am pleased to see it written about well in a book.<br />The story concerning a woman who dies, even after gaining protection from her abusive husband, is very complex. It got a little confusing trying to follow the threads of the story in some parts. But on the whole, an enjoyable mystery. Just would have liked a lot more historical information about that island and its hospitals...maybe the author would consider writing a nonfiction about that?<br />Karen L.

This was one of Paretsky's better mysteries with her sleuth, V. I. Warshawski. The basic premise of the book involves recent events (90's) by children of parents killed in the Holocaust attempting to get their family's money out of Swiss banks, and evidently, cash in on life insurance sold to Jewish families throughout Europe, who were frighten by the obvious anti-Semitic of Hitler and his attempts to conquer Europe. Also involved is the issue in this country of slave reparations...both of these topics entertwine with each other throughout the whole mystery. ....<br />As other reviewers have stated, the first hundred pages or so of setting up the plot is slightly onerous, or I would have given the book a five. Once you get past that the book reads extremely quickly. This is one book in which Warshawski ends  up trying to help her mentor and friend, Lotty, who was one of the children sent to England prior to WWII to save their lives (by their families and parents). How ironic that these children often felt abandoned, when their parents were trying to do their best to save them. Yet, children do not understand the nature of the adult world, and so they create explanations that can make total sense for them.<br />In the midst of all this tragedy, the efforts of insurance companies to avoid paying out what they owed to these families, and the murder that tied this all together...is another side plot having to do with planted memories and whether recalled memories under psychotherapy are real or not. ... The picture drawn of this pitiable man searching for an anchor in the form of a family after spending a lifetime of abuse under the hands of a ruthless man (who also sold life insurance policies to the Jews in Europe, and African-Americans in the U.S.) is very poignant. You understand the exasperation of V. I. with this guy who was barging his way into Lotty's extended family, but also you feel for him. One of the problems with the book lay in the fact that some of the loose ends not 'solved' to my satisfaction was with this particular person. I wish Paretsky had told us more about the reality of this man's life, as well as solving the murder and Lotty's problems from the Holocaust.<br />Otherwise, an extremely good read!<br />Karen Sadler	2003-02-14
1252347:US	53067930	R946BGFUGYQ0O	0140169318	522490564	Children of the Flames: Dr. Josef Mengele and the Untold Story of the Twins of Auschwitz	Books	5	60	72	N	N	Remembering that 'science' can be used to hurt others...	This book confused me at first, I am afraid. It took me a while to figure out what the authors were doing in jumping from information about Mengele at particular times in his life, to the words (spoken or written) of the children who suffered so much under his hands (also at that particular point in their lives). By the middle of the book, I figured out the author's use of comparison between Mengele and the children's groups to illustrate the great differences between the children growing up as adults and overcoming their past/dealing with it, while Mengele dwindled into the nothing that he really was in South America. <br />Of course, I'd heard or read some things about Mengele, but it was in the process of reading information about bioethics that I was introduced to this book, and decided I should read it for background on some work I'm doing, as per science and medicine and those least able to protect themselves against unethical practitioners of these 'arts'. The book does not dwell on the horrors that Mengele practiced on these children, and also on dwarves and giants and any other 'misfits' he was interested in. What information there is in the book (it was in story form, rather than professional paper format with numbers marking footnotes or endnotes...but there was additional information at the back of the book based on pages), indicates that Mengele was less of a scientist or a doctor, and more of a technician. His ideas for the experiments were quite often not his own, and he was extremely sloppy in keeping records that even had Germany won the war, would have provided genetic information of use to anyone else. I doubt sincerely any other scientist/physician could have copied his work and gotten the same results...and this is an absolute law in science now. Most often Mengele's work seemed to be done to satisfy his own curiosity as well as his obvious need to be in control and to hurt others. <br />The story of Mengele's exile is an living record of the book \\"The Picture of DOrian Grey.\\" Though Mengele did not lose his good looks or his vanity, he did suffer from problems of his own making, both familial and psychological and physical. I am sure it is of no relief to those families and children who suffered at his hands that he was never brought to account (and I suspect the U.S. as well as other countries are all a bit guilty of blinding themselves), but the man did spend the rest of his life undergoing demeaning circumstances, losing his degrees, total alienation from his family, and numerous real and hypochondrial diseases/pains.<br />Perhaps the most outstanding thing about the book, other than the need to remind the world of the story of these children, is how many of them went on to create lives for themselves that were of great worth, in spite of never forgetting their deceased twins and families, or the horror of what was done to them. My heart broke for the girls who became mothers in their own right, only to suffer from extreme panic and anxiety due to their own past concerning their children. It was and is totally understandable that they should fear constantly, yet so many were able to overcome and be successful in their lives. A story of courage on their parts, a story to be remembered and not forgotten on our part. <br />For once again, the specter of eugenics and genetic manipulation is raising it's head throughout the world, with the passage of laws that allow others to make decisions for the individual concerning what constitutes a life of worth, what defines brain death, and even what type of children people should be able to bear...for the good of society of course. Those same words were spoken and used by Hitler, his cronies, and the physicians and scientists who so willingly followed his orders...all in the name of genetics and science. Those who forget (or do not read about their history), will be condemned to repeat it...<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2003-01-26

I adored them as an adolescent and in my twenties. Always fascinated by fairy tales, mythology, and the Arthurian stories of White and others, Tolkien's tales remained the ultimate in combining these genres with exquisite writing that surpasses the years. Both my husband and I have owned a variety of paperbacks of the books, but when the movie was made and I saw this edition, I decided to splurge and get it. I went and saw the first and second movies without prereading again, and for a deaf person, seeing a film in the theater is something we rarely do, but I did to get the majesty of the film and the story. AFter the recent release of the second part of the film, I finally opened this edition, and started reading.<br />The story has not faded with time, if anything it still remains the ultimate fictional story of good against evil. This edition is absolutely breathtaking. The map alone is worth opening again and again to understand the major work Tolkien did in writing this epic. He created an entire world that breathes, he created languages and poetry to go with this world, and characters that feel as real as our often long distant families.<br />Every child, every adolescent deserves to be able to read these books, and become familiar with the English language as it adorns these books. For those enamored of the trilogy and movie, this is the ultimate gift. The book is complete with drawings and runes of elves. An incredibly brilliant lifetime achievement of one man's imagination, that continually feeds our own imaginations.<br />Karen Sadler,<br />Science Education,<br />University of Pittsburgh	2003-01-17

This one left me flummoxed! Grafton is definitely one of our better writers of the female detective genre in the U.S. I prefer her books to some others I could name, mainly because she is an intelligent writer. However, like many of these 'series' that get started with the best of intentions, this particular one is losing steam...I commisserate with Grafton's probable frustration at having cornered herself into writing a series of mysteries from A to Z. It must be difficult to come up with original ideas after a period of time.<br />However, that really did not seem to be the problem here. The book was slow in starting, but then seemed to be chugging along just fine. I kept looking at the remaining pages left for me to read as they got smaller and smaller with no obvious 'end' in sight. So when Grafton literally ended with a phone call, and no real obvious conclusion (no one was arrested, no one confronted except the wrong person, etc.)...well, I went backwards through several pages and chapters to see if I had missed something. I know I read fast especially when it comes to books I pick up for pure enjoyment, but I didn't think I read it that fast! Not only was the main crime not solved to my satisfaction, but the side story dealing with Kinsey's involvement with a couple of sleazy brothers was never solved either.<br />This is not to discourage anyone from reading Grafton's books...she is, as I have said, an intelligent author, and she doesn't dummy down her books for her audience (which makes me cringe). But this time, she lost me at the very end...I know it wasn't just me, because some of the other reviewers said the same thing.<br />Karen Sadler	2003-01-02

I've used many of the beverages, especially the hot ones, for all kinds of get-togethers. Even adolescents appreciate a nice hot cup of apple cider/wassail in the fall after playing football. For those who prefer to find comfort in each other's company, rather than drinking alcohol, this book provides the beverages and the desserts (so many tend to have alcohol at Christmastime) without the problems.<br />Many of the recipes are simple, good food.

I find it slightly humorous that within a short period of time, say a month, I read The Killers Within which is about the rise of bacteria that are resistant to all antibiotics, read another book about the world created by the Black Plague in the 14th century (which was awful, but gave a basic understanding of life during that time), and then just accidently picked up this book without realizing that it was going to be a fictional work tieing the information of the two above books together. <br />I didn't read the first book in this series, called The Plague Tales. I may well go back and get it so I can see where it started. From the understanding that archeological digs can occasionally release things that have lain dormant for centuries, it is easy to believe that in our quest for knowledge, we release things that would have been better left undisturbed.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The writing was more than adequate, and the plot made significant 'sense' to me. There was enough background provided in flashbacks and other hints to what had happened to bring out the original plague. I belong to a bioethical/disability group that seeks to prevent new genetic technologies being used to discriminate against those with disabilities and differences. So the concern for a large database containing all of our genetic information is extremely valid right now. Since a recent expedition occurred in which attempts were made to find frozen DNA of the original Spanish flu of 1918 (that killed one of my great grandmothers), and many fears were expressed then that the world could once again be exposed to a bacterial killer for which we have no vaccine or antibiothic. As once said by Michael Crichton in one of his books, 'scientists are too often proving they can do something, and they forget to ask whether they should do something!'<BR>This includes cloning of humans who will most often come out with severe disabilities, the ever present threat of assisted suicide/euthanasia for those considered unworthy of life, genetic manipulation of food crops without research into whether those genetic manipulations will have long-term consequences for environmental impact or human consumption.<br />This is definitely one of those books you cannot put down. A lot of research went into this particular piece of fiction. It is not far enough in the future to qualify as science fiction, and there are several plots to keep separate...one historical that has a direct impact on the plot based in the future. I will not waste times on books from authors who I think are unwilling to do the research, to understand the basic sciences behind this type of horrifying scenario. I would find it hard to place this book in any specific genre...what's important is that it is a great read.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-12-22

I was curious to finish this book and see what others who read this thing had to say about it. As someone with a science background, I found the possibility of two or more disease being involved in the Black Plague an interesting concept. And I usually don't mind people writing like they talk, or writing so that history or science are understandable to everyone. However, this book went a bit too far. First off, Cantor may or may not be a major medieval historian, but most people in academia know you do not write or make speculations concerning medical history, unless you have some way to back yourself up. He gives a list of books he recommends to read, and occasionally, very occasionally, he recommends someone else's work within the text. But no where did he refer to actual writings (except fiction like Shakespeare), or footnote/endnote anything, or give the reader some idea that he could back up his rampant speculations with anything. He makes continuous comments about HIV/AIDS, including some new ones I had never heard or read about...and I worked in an AIDS lab for four years! <br />Some of the other more knowledgeable readers of this book wrote hilarious 'non-recommendations'. Only the fact that it was not the worst book I've ever read kept it from getting one point! Believe the other readers!!! I highly do not recommend any readers waste their valuable time or money on this book. It's as atrocious a piece of history as I have ever read. If it has any value at all, it's as a source of academic humor...<br />Which of course, begs the question, of all those who gave 'praise' in newspapers, journals, etc. to this book. Are the publishers of this book just incredibly good at cutting out and splicing together parts of reviews? I just noticed something...Anne Rice recommended this book. If I had seen that, I would never have bought it! My only excuse is I didn't see the book prior to purchasing it.

As she kept mentioning 'recovered memories' that should have clued me in to the horrible conclusion, but for some reason there was not enough information given in the poetry of the person Carlotta was looking for, or the background of the family.<br />Yeah, it deals with a topic that makes me very uncomfortable, even though I realize that in reality this type of family situation happens more often then we know. It's just I don't find this stuff even remotely entertaining or interesting....ugh. And the language of Barnes' books are getting more and more rough.

Excellent, excellent job done in research and writing by Shnayerson &amp; Plotkin. If the reader is involved in science or public health, the 'news' in this book does not come as a surprise to anyone. It's been known for years among those in these communities that bacteria has been developing resistance to our antibiotics from day one. We get taught this if you work in a lab, because it becomes vitally important to keep everything absolutely sterile and clean. I know it is taught in medical school, but they don't emphasize this enough to medical students and doctors and nurses, because many doctors continue to dispense antibiotics like candy even though they have been warned and warned again by the Center for Disease Control and others.<br />For those who enjoy reading stuff like this to scare themselves...well, good luck. This is the stuff of nightmares, and if you spend a lot of your time worrying, I certainly wouldn't recommend you read this book. There is always hope, as the authors point out, that researchers will continue to find antibiotics that will temporarily restrain bacterial onslaught. However, be assured this hope has been relied upon in the past, and the bacteria always seem to find a way to mutate around medication, regardless of whether the antibiotics had an organic chemical basis or was a synthetic/man-made one, not seen in nature. <br />Most of the time, the people who pick up this type of book are already involved and concerned about this public health disaster-in-the-making. Yet these authors are trying to get this information out to the public, and write in such a way as to make this science knowledge understandable. The book starts out slowly, but picks up pace quickly. I had difficulty putting it down after the first couple of chapters. It is absolutely vital that the public be aware that responsibility for correct antibiotic use lies not just with the physicians, but with the patients and parents of patients who beg their doctors for antibiotics, when those antibiotics are not called for. As the authors bring up, most antibiotics given out by pediatricians are for ear infections (&gt;60%). Yet often times those ear infections will go away on their own, with the antibiotics only minimalizing the length of time of the course of infection. Yet, all of us are guilty of expecting physicians to give us 'something' to make a cold or the flu 'go away'. Unfortunately, too often those illnesses are not caused by bacteria, but by viruses, and giving antibiotics in this manner just give bacteria an opportunity to switch genes around to build resistance. Same thing with not taking all of a prescription after the patient starts feeling better, or sharing medication not prescribed for others.<br />I hope this book is widely read. Maybe if enough consumers become concerned, we can put a stop to certain practices such as the use of antibiotics in animal feed as growth factors, regardless if they are known to be used for human consumption. The public needs to get more involved in their own medical care, and that means participating in governmental processes to fight against massive lobbying by pharmaceutical companies and livestock/meat companies and their lackeys, who often don't know and don't care about the possible consequences of their indiscriminate use of antibiotics. <br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-11-17

It was such a tremendous surprise to me to find a well-written and articulate novel, based on a historical happening that I had never heard about. Most of the other reviewers have given a good synopsis of the surface story in this book. A young single mother is raising her son after the accidental death of the child's father, who was an academic explorer. The child comes face to face with a catastrophic illness, aplastic anemia, and the only real potential donor is the step-brother of this boy, a young adult, who the mother had alienated by charging him with responsibility for the death of the father of both. The story revolves around the search for this step-brother who is blaming himself for the loss of his father, and trying to follow in his father's footsteps as a means of forgiveness and absolution.<br />Underlying this poignant story is the true story of the 1845 Franklin expedition. I had no idea that even that late in the 19th century they were still trying to find a passage through the Northwest, over the American Continent. As per usual, the British need to explore and expand human knowledge, put them in the driver's seat. Two ships, combining sail and steam as the ultimate in technology at that time period, tried to make their way through the ice floes of the northern seas. Even with their best efforts including the metalization of the hulls of the ships and massive provisions from the new methods of storing foodstuffs in cans (for longer keeping), the ships were doomed to failure. <br />I checked online to the great quantities of information available concerning the Franklin expedition. Such notable groups as National Geographic are STILL searching for evidence of these ships and the locations of both the ships and the men, who were never heard from again. Only a few buried bodies and a a couple of canisters with information written by the captains concerning the whereabouts of these great ships have been found in over 150 years.<br />McGregor did her research and got the expedition information right, even though she had to create a 'voice' in the presence of a young boy on ship. In the midst of the heroic efforts of these men to survive and further the growth of human knowledge, the story of what actually led to their demise is horrifying. Once again, like with the shuttle Challenger, the greed of those men/corporations providing materials for these 'ships' doomed these men to almost sure death. In this case, it was the canned goods, which were sealed with tin that leaked lead into the meat inside. On top of that, the meat inside was often put in without prior cooking, and the temperatures reached for sealing the cans were not high enough to cook either the middle of the meat, nor complete the vacuum. This meant that the meats  were raw, and over time became disgusting and putrid, as well as many of the tins contained botulism (one of the faster acting toxins even used in biowarfare today). There is written evidence of an inquiry into the tin cans from the 1850's and the exposure of this horrific negligence in order to gain more money by the man who supplied these goods to the royal navy of Britain. Once again, man's inhumanity to man raises it's ugly head.<br />The book is extremely articulate, the pictures drawn by the author well-done. The agony of the mother and those who love this child who is going through chemotherapy and the push for a bone marrow transplant are accurate (as I've been through it with a friend's daughter who did not survive with leukemia).<br />I went through this book in two days flat even with work and dissertation.Highly recommended!!!<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education	2002-11-11

This was a difficult book to put down, when I needed to go do something else. Usually, modern mysteries about serial killers make me a little queasy...not my usual type of mystery. However, Johansen does a fairly good job, without resorting to unnecessary violence (I thought). Books that involve characters who talk a lot often do not give a real look at the character, so you can understand where they are coming from. Johansen gives enough insight into the psyche of each of the main characters, so the plots make sense, and the choices those characters make, make sense. Hard to do in such a short read, but well-done in this particular novel. <br />I am not a big fan of any mystery writers who write about children and crime...there are a few out there, and I avoid their books like the plague. Personal preference. I know I've read this particular author's work before, and she doesn't make a constant topic of either serial murder or children as victims. <br />This is not great literature. But it's a good read, that recognizes the reader's intelligence. <br />Karen Sadler	2002-11-04

This was a book I had high expectations for, and it didn't meet them. After coming off of reading several books on creativity in artists and manic-depression (bipolar disorder), reading about John Nash, and Oliver Sack's interesting boyhood...I was very intrigued by the thought of reading about strange scientists. I'd met so many that almost fit that category just at my university, who were obsessive about their science (especially the 'fly' guys! and the computer/artificial intelligence/robot geeks), that in reading this book I recognized more of this behavior than I thought existed originally. The book has great information, but I was extremely disappointed over the organization of the book. It's like someone did all this research on individuals and the things that intrigued him about intelligence, then just pasted in the chapters with no thought to how the book should be organized. <br />Most other books give an explanation or definition of the conditions he is talking about...kind of a guideline of what to look for first before dealing with individuals. Or they look at specific disorders and bring up individuals who went overboard in these areas. When you start reading the book, you think \\"Oh...this is individual chapters about men with scientific genius (no women included...why?), and then the author tells you in the middle of his chapters that he will explain more about particular problems/disorders in Chapter so-and-so. It's like he doesn't have enough confidence you will read to the end, so he kind of puts a carrot in front of the audience. Not smart to treat your potential audience as maybe being less than intelligent!<br />The setup of the chapters were annoying. The author would give \\"The Straight Dope\\"--info on what these men accomplished, and then a section on \\"Strange Brains\\", the idiosyncracies and eccentricities of their lives. I guess I should have been more prepared for this by the rather odd choice for the frontpiece of the book. Though I was notexpecting a textbook, I did think it was a serious topic. Yet, it seems to be written for mass consumption along the lines of a celebrity tell-all that you would find in some hokey magazine.<br />Most of these men were geniuses who magnified their callings in this world to the point of hurting themselves emotionally and socially. They couldn't help it because they lived in times where their disorder was not treatable as a physical disorder of the brain. If it were treatable, the question always arises...would their genius be altered because their obsession could be controlled? This is the current bioethical question on medicating even for things such as Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD/ADHD) to make children come into the norms of society and the control of teachers. <br />I really questioned the addition of the Unabomber in comparison to the other entries. The rest did magnificent things, and their compulsions hurt themselves, but rarely others. Kaczynski on the other hand never achieved anything useable, and created things leading to havoc and death. Regardless of his supposed 'braininess', the Unabomber leaves the area of obsession-compulsions, and enters serious mental illness with his persecution complex and his psychotic behavior. A very large difference between him and the others in this book...and not one I would want my students to read about in classrooms.<br />The rest of the chapters are haphazardly put together on IQ and other aspects of intelligence, information gleaned from web browsing and apparently, chat rooms on psychiatry....	2002-11-01

It's been a while since I picked up one of P.D. James' books. Too long obviously. Another one of the premiere British mystery authors, who writes with class and good grammar. Dagliesh is one of my all time favorite protagonists in any book. He's smart and has interests outside of his job at Scotland Yard. He's respected by his colleagues and subordinates, who look to him for guidance and approval.<br />In this particular story, Dagliesh returns to a theological college he is familiar with from his childhood, and which holds fond memories for him. Unfortunately, his return is because of a suspicious death, and while he is there, a murder happens in the church with him sleeping nearby. He is compelled to find the tie between the two deaths and the people who are live on the grounds of the theological college are all suspects. <br />James' writing, her intelligence, the placement of the stories...all contribute to a great story. Once again she proves that our capacities to contribute do not have to decline with age. I can only hope that I will be doing half as well as she when I am that age. Readers who enjoy well-written British mysteries that show intelligence for their audience, will most assuredly enjoy this book.<br />Karen Sadler	2002-10-28

I make a habit of looking at what's new in that particular section, just to keep up on my own interests in Neuroscience. This particular book looked interesting...I have a new grandchild coming and I wanted to reread about Botulism. I was surprised to find out there were more strains of botulism than I had previously been led to believe. That particular chapter also gave me information concerning the different impact of the Botulism on infants in comparison to adults (different strain too), which I didn't know. Very helpful in case I ever see these particular symptoms in an infant under a year, which, since I am surrounded by kids at church and sometimes at schools...is important to know.<br />This book has different chapters written by different authors who are familiar with the toxins. Some authors are better than others: The guys who wrote on toxins from shellfish were very humorous in their writing, and I enjoyed that. Most of the chapters give plenty of technical information concerning the chemistry of the toxins. The heroin chapter gave almost too much technical information. Not a book you want available to teenagers. Most of the chapters gave concise information about what is known about the neurological action of the toxins, and what possible treatments, antidotes, and vaccines are available. I had no idea there was a vaccine for botulism, but there is. Some of the toxins have no readily available treatments other than clearing the body of the toxin and support for life functions.<br />I browsed through the stuff I had read before in classes, but much of this was more detailed and in this day and age, extremely current information on toxins that everyone is concerned about including toxins used in biowarfare. As a mother and grandmother, again, I have to warn not to leave this around where kids can get ahold of it (though at first glance it looks like a textbook and kids shy clear of those!) It's also imperative that those who have mental problems be steered clear of this book, though I suppose you can get a lot of this information off of the Internet.<br />It is important for more people within medical fields and outside of them, to be up-to-date on information like this. I told my husband some things that pertain to his job as a Scoutmaster. Perhaps more accidental deaths and death from exposure to work products could be prevented if more people were familiar with the information in this book.<	2002-10-21

Not much can be added to the accolades of so many people concerning the books and art of Maurice Sendak. I grew up with his work, I read his books to my children, I am reading them now to my grandchildren. ... And so will send for a hardback edition this time around. When children ask to read a book over and over again, you know that that book has found a place in their imaginations. This is one such book. When I think of a classic picture book, there are two such Maurice Sendak books that come to mind. His work is beyond mere illustration, it is an artform. The pictures require close attention to catch all the visual nuances. <br />Max is a typical little boy, who dons his wolf outfit and becomes a 'wolf' in his active imagination. In sending him to bed without dinner, he uses his imagination to turn his room into a wild forest inhabited by humongous monsters. He asserts his powers over the monsters, and becomes their rightful king, for he is surely a monster himself! Yet, his mother loves him in spite of his monsterism...and eventually he comes home to find that mother has relented and brought in his dinner...<br />This winter, get this book, this classic and sit down in a big chair with a child and read and pore over this book together. Every time a child is read to, it expands their imaginations, helps to determine their life course, aids in getting them ready for school and the 'real world'. Our children are not getting the aural and visual stimulation that is our right as chldren. My parents read to me, and I've never stopped reading because of that...in spite of captioned television and computer access. Our children have a right to be read to by someone they love and someone who loves them. Turn the television and computers off, and use a rainy evening to spend time with your own monsters. Maybe someday they will become the next Maurice Sendak!<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-10-11

Joe Sixsmith is a new character for me from Hill, though other reviewers say he's written with him before. A thoroughly enjoyable man who manages to get himself involved in other people's problems even if he weren't a PI. Joe has a bit of a heroic death-wish in this book. He keeps plunging into flaming houses to rescue people. In the process, he not only saves two women (one who deserves saving, the other who doesn't) but he opens a rancid can of worms in the form of people. I won't say any more so as not to give the plots away, not one of my favorite topics...but Hill handles it well and with minimal gratuitous violence or other types of behavior. <br />Hill's ability to use words is always a pleasure to read. Joe is an educated man, with an appreciation (and healthy fear) of his aunt who raised him and for many of the worthy traits she taught him. He is going to sing with his church's choir down at a Welsh exhibition/contest, which falls apart due to the shenanigans of a variety of Welsh characters. It's always interesting to read concerning areas of the world I have no experience in, and Hill inspires a desire to see Wales for the countryside and the people.<br />Hope to see more of Sixsmith...he's a pleasant fellow.	2002-10-05

Well, that will teach me not to read the entire review of a book before sending for it! Not that I'm complaining about the book...I thought it was for adults. It's not really, though I can see using it for reading and science literacy for deaf adults.<br />This is a great book. The explanations concerning what happened to Mr. Gage, and the science behind his medical recovery and subsequent personality problems is fairly well covered. There is a great glossary in the back with more information concerning terminology used in 'brain science' such as abscess and neurotransmitters that can be used as a jumping point for students to do their own research into areas that interest them, whether on the Internet or in libraries.<br />I kind of skimmed through the text. Most of it was stuff I've had over exposure to. The text is well written, just more simple than I am used to reading. Fleischman writes very tongue-in-cheek (come to think of it, Gage couldn't do that for a while on one side!). I appreciate Fleischman's humor, and I am sure most teachers and students will find it refreshing from boring textbooks written by professors or publishing houses. The science is correct in this book, which I am finding is often NOT the case in textbooks...so maybe teachers should stop using textbooks and use books such as this, journals and the Internet!<br />My favorite part of this book, of course, are the pictures, the MRI scans, the reconstitution of his brain within his skull using modern techniques. Very fun to see all this together. Gage is learned about in every neuroscience class I had from an undergrad to graduate level. We talk about the fact that he survived this stunning blow, about his personality changes in neuropsychiatric classes, about possible relations between other disorders such as autism and what happened in lobotomies (ugh!...). Everyone in Neuroscience knows about Gage. He is fascinating to the point of remembering his name when we can't remember names of past acquaintances.<br />Fun book, good science, great pictures, a good introduction for kids to neuroscience.<br />Karen Sadler,<br />Science Education,<br />University of Pittsburghacquaintances.<br />Fun book, good science, great pictures, a good introduction for kids to neuroscience.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-10-04

Since when did National Geographic start publishing books such as this? I thought they confined themselves to coffee table books and travelogues... (Note to the Publishers: Proofread your books better!)<br />This book had to wait until the turn of the century in order to have a determination made of which of the hurricanes of the 20th century deserved the label of 'Storm of the Century'. On most fronts, the hurricane of 1935 that hit the Keys deservedly earned the title. The numbers alone dictate the label: winds of probably 200 mph, 20 foot storm surge, total inundation of the islands of the Keys, and a known death record of over 400 (with a suspected higher death record due to unknown quantities of people on the Keys). <br />The research was obviously done in this book. Even though the author does not list or number his research as would be done for a paper for a professional journal, the bibliography indicates that the author can back up his statements with the archived records. Anyone who doubts his word is free to search for and read the orginals themselves. <br />Another reviewer mentions \\"Issac's Storm\\" from a couple of years ago. That book is much better written, and somehow conveys the human tragedy better than this book does. I think perhaps it is because this book does not see fit to present the facts alone, but there is an obvious political slant to the author's rant. It does come across as a rant unfortunately. Not that I am enamored of FDR or that my family members liked him...they did not...they were Republicans. However, history is too often influenced unnecessarily when written as it is. I prefer my history unadorned by human opinions, speculations, and politics. Just present the facts to the readers, and expect the readers to have the intelligence to draw their own conclusions. Drye apparently doesn't have enough faith in his audience to interpret the mistakes and the arrogance of those making the mistakes. That does a disservice to the readers.<br/>The story is compelling, and Drye is right in maintaining that the current population of the Keys and the attitudes that many have towards this type of storm are leading toward future disaster. The same can be said for continued building on shorelines across the east coast, the build-up of communities on known volcanoes (whether active or slumbering across the U.S.), the continued danger of New Orleans, etc. Hopefully books like these will renew the debates and maybe some people will base their decisions to live in areas of such obvious danger on well-documented historical proof.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-10-03

Must come from my Dad who is an archaelogical enthusiast especially for the Middle East. Anyway, I really enjoyed finding a new author within this particular subfield of mysteries. I don't have enough background in ancient Egypt to be critical of the names or historical useage of the time period. For the most part the book was very readable, and fun, if a bit on the bloody side. I wonder if Egypt was always that dismissive of the value of a human life. I surmise that they were since the Pharoahs had no problems with using servants and slaves to build their great tombs, and then killed all of those people. That attitude must have filtered down to everyone eventually. It's amazing that this 'civilization' lasted as long as it did, when they were so uncivilized!<br />My only complaint about the book has to do with the author's continued use of the word 'retorted'. No one 'retorts' that much!!! Because the author used a lot of conversations to convey the story, he constantly used \\"he said\\", \\"she stated\\", and the word \\"retorted\\" seemed to be every other one. Get a thesaurus, PLEASE! Or read some more grammar books about how to write conversations. This is not just the author's fault...editors should be looking for this type of problem and making suggestions. Sounds like nitpicking on my part, but I will stop reading books and especially series, if the language is not up to par (even if the history is ok).<br />Otherwise, I enjoyed learning more about the time period. I hope the author is doing his research so I don't get misinformation about that particular part of world history.<br />Karen Sadler	2002-09-21

It had been a long time since I first saw the Apollo 13 movie and it was on TV, so I stopped and watched (and didn't move again until it was finished). The movie was fascinating, and it really triggered an interest to know more about what actually happened. With the limited time format in a movie to convey the technical information and the science behind 'slingshotting' the Apollo spacecraft around the moon, it was difficult to the full impact of the immense effort to get these men back safely. So when I had an opportunity to get the book, I did.<br />I think this is the first time I've read a book and seen a movie that were both excellent. The movie did the best possible job in a limited time to convey the urgency. The book, which is filled with the conversations of the astronauts with NASA space center, as well as the innovation behind the scenes of all the men involved (and the companies) is absolute 'must' reading for anyone who wants to understand the science and engineering behind this almost-disaster. I beg to differ with the men who felt they had failed, including Lovell who did not get to land on the moon. Without the knowledge they gained from this flight, more people may have died...and it certainly advanced knowledge and understanding for space flight for the rest of us left on earth below. <br />This is an incredible story and an well-written book. I could hardly put the thing down, and this is not an area of expertise or interest for me usually. It's a little hard to keep the names and people straight, because so many were involved. But it is worth the effort. This is an excellent book to give to students interested in space or engineering. I could see requiring this book to be read in science classrooms, showing the movie, and then having the students get more involved in the actual science, such as calculations of distances...map/reliefs of why the moon for a slingshot effect, etc. <br />Great stuff, and for once, great men who truly can be called heroes (both on the earth and in space).

It just was not sufficiently interesting. His protagonist is a Methodist, and I guess, speaks like they did back then. I don't know about that...but one of the major sentences frequently used in the book is \\"Let that bide.\\" AFter the 50th time reading that I was about to hurl the book. <br />I don't usually mind the introduction of actual people into fictionalized books provided it was done well. This time, it felt very 'fake' and contrived. Maybe I am wrong here...but Marx was not well-known outside of Europe, and he became very well-known later when Lenin got ahold of his works and used them for his own purposes. The information glut we have now from computers did not exist then...newspapers were usually rags of yellow journalism, especially here in the U.S. I find it difficult to believe a young religious soldier would be familiar at all with Marx. <br />There is an audience for this author.

As a undergraduate student of organic chemistry at the age of 37, I found myself in deep you-know-what! It was bad enough entering into the twilight zone of madhouse chemists, but to top that I had just lost the rest of my hearing and was using sign language interpreters for the first time. Apparently, not a lot has changed in organic chemistry over a long period of time, at least for teaching undergrads. The book was absolutely archaic, very boring and very badly written. I don't think there was a whole sentence in the entire book!<br />Needless to say, I went scrambling for some help. The Vis-ed cards were being sold in our university bookstore. These are small cards that have a chemical or chemiscal reaction on one side and what it looks like (rings with attached carbons, etc.) or what the reaction makes on the other side. Since memorization is the name of the game in organic chem to a certain extent, this type of card is tantamount to making your own index card.

I was cleaning out some boxes of children's books, keeping what I consider classic while giving the rest to my grandchildren or to the libraries. I doubled-back between this current edition and the previous editions to make sure this was the same one...it is, and I highly recommend this. I took a class in children's literature back in the 70's and I fondly remember it as being one of the most enjoyable classes I had in college the first time around. This book lasted through my children's growing up and is now going through new useage with my grandchildren. I love the way this book is organized. If you have a child with specific interests such as limericks (and I know few children who don't get a kick out of limericks) you can go to that section without delay.<br />I grew up with Joan Walsh Anglund poignant drawings. They are not particularly 'great' art, but for children and in this book, they are vastly more suitable than the poorly drawn and maddening stuff put out in cartoons (especially of the Pokemon variety which will set off seizures in children). They say the age of this book is for four years to eight year olds. That isn't true. Every parent should try to take the time to read to all children in whatever form necessary...and it should start at age one. Reading aloud (or signing books) to your children not only makes essential bonds, but it also teaches children what you think is important, and also teaches them how to stop and pay attention. The massive complaints about restless children and the abuse of labeling (ADD/ADHD) has its beginnings in simple things such as turning the television/computers off and reading to your children.<br />... should be showing the pictures and pages of this book in a sampling, so that parents can make informed decisions about children's books. If you only get one child's book this year, get this one and sit down with your children and read.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-08-25

My husband and I ran across this book at Christmas time, in a music store! It was not what we went there for (a gift for a musician), but we both loved it so much...we bought it without thinking about it! My husband, as a photographer, and I, as a deaf person, loved the gorgeous pictures. As grandparents who are trying to teach the value and beauty of the natural world to our grandchildren, we felt this is a unique addition to our 'coffee table books'. We refuse to buy books that merely sit there, and are not enjoyed...this particular book provides hours of enjoyment all year round for both us and our grandchildren. <br />As always we enjoy anything with a sense of humor. The photograph of the deer eating the carrot nose of the snowman, really was the clinching selling point for this incredible book. <br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-08-21

While going on vacation with a pile of scholarly books and papers, I grabbed a couple of early mysteries by Hill. I felt as I read this particular one, that it was definitely his first (though I didn't know for sure). I also felt that as an author he has done very well, not in terms of financial attainment from his work, but that unlike several current mystery authors I could name...Reginald Hill retained the quality of his writing as he continued the series. Not only that, but he can claim that his quality of writing has improved. Whether or not some readers dislike his wordiness and his attempt to keep his writing fresh through his continuous reading, Hill has mostly avoided falling into the usual rut of other mystery writers. His characters and the plots of the books continue to be unique and well-done, even as the series edges on to thirty years old or more.<br />I was jealous to read that other reviewers have had access to a television version of Hill's mysteries. I hope they are well done, and would love to see them, but at the same time I am leary lest Dalziel not be the person my mind has drawn him as. Pascoe's shoes would probably be easier to fill.<br />This book IS slightly dated. It is only through having grown up in the sixties, that I recognize much of the language and the mores of the time period. Perhaps the reoccurance of the fashions (there is a contradiction in terms) of the 1970's will make some of the book more understandable to other readers. Of course, Hill would choose to write about something he knows. Rugby may be foreign to American readers, but I enjoyed reading about it, even though it's rules are not quite clear. However, the enthusiasm of men for their sport and the comraderies among these men is certainly not something new. <br />A fun read...<br />Karen Sadler	2002-08-20

Since I've had to go get several papers used in this book at a variety of libraries, I have not yet found one problem.<br />Even more important is the quality of information provided in this book that is critical to educators and parents of deaf children. As a deaf person and a deaf student, I wish that my parents had had this type of help available to them back in the 60's and 70's, when I was attending public school. I know they were deeply frustrated with the total lack of information concerning how to participate in my education, and why I 'learned' some things easily and well, but had problems with other things. It would be criminal for parents of deaf children today (especially hearing parents with no prior introduction to deafness), not to use this book to increase their knowledge about how their children can best be helped to learn. <br />The three men who wrote this book are all uniquely qualified to provide this critical information. Marschark is the prevailing voice of wisdom in educating deaf learners. His previous books have delved into the psychological and educational needs and abilities of deaf learners, and he provides fair and concise information about what is known from all fields (such as MRI studies of the brain activity in deaf learners, as well as types of communication strategies that will or will not work). Dr. Harry Lang is not only a physicist and a deaf educator, but a deaf person himself who having been through the system knows not only what it is like, but also what really needs to be done. He also provides a lot of input into the teaching of difficult subjects such as science and math. Dr. John Albertini is a professor of English whose research into intertwining of English skills into other subjects (science for example) has helped educators to use and promote English literacy throughout the entire educational experience of deaf learners. This provides a bootstrap to deaf learners to achieve literacy in other subjects... There is still a great deal of controversy concerning educating deaf and hard-of-hearing students, concerning language and the abilities of these students to learn. ... <br />Lest I give readers the idea that this book is written in an inaccessible manner, I want to assure them that this is not so. While it is true that writing for research journals is very different and often inaccessible to the lay person, these three authors go out of their way to make this book as easily understandable as possible. The book is research-based, not research writing. This book is an essential text for educators and librarians to buy, and it is an essential text for parents and for deaf learners themselves to read in order to help themselves...	2002-08-10

The play on language is even funny to me, a deaf person! I figure Hill must have known about the Grateful Dead, and the resident Deadheads, who I grew up with in the Bay Area in California. The information about roses was wonderful since my Dad planted them, but certainly was not as obsessive about his flowers as Patrick.<BR>This rather charming man is not only a fanatic about his roses, but is also (or seems to be) a man who gets rid of those in his way, financially or otherwise. <br />It's kind of eerie to think that we have murderers among us, but I guess if we all realize that often innocents are sent to jail, the guilty are still at large! Patrick is so unassuming and charming, that he even makes friends of Pascoe and his wife Ellie. I really liked the plot development between the two women, one who prides herself on her radical causes and the other who would normal be referred to as elitist and prissy, but is actually otherwise. <br />The ending again surprised me. Just put it down to the fact that Hill likes to keep his public guessing. A very well-written and humorous mystery.<br />Karen SAdler	2002-07-31

I am loathe to give Reginald Hill a 'bad grade', but if he were my student, he'd get one for this particular novel. I'd probably give him an A for effort, a B for unusual reliance on the Homerian stories (The Iliad etc.), a B for trying to understand women (which considering most guys flunk so this is really good!), and a C for plot devices, and a C- for confusion! As previous reviewers indicated, the reader often goes into the chapters on this particular book, and comes out the other end going &quot;Huh?&quot; I like not being able to determine exactly what is going on in the mystery. However, I like my reading to be straight forward, with a minimum of confusion. Hill tries too hard to be clever in this book (take my word for it, at least us Americans know you have better education then we do!). He flips from character to character too fast, and too awkwardly for the reader to assimilate. <br />I actually got a kick out of Ellie Pascoe's 'Comfort Blanket'. Her need to find an outlet for her energy and her intelligence after nursing her daughter to health (as well as her understanding that her priorities have changed) are totally understandable. She's waiting to see whether she will start being a published writer...Hill should know all about that. I was disappointed that she didn't follow through with this story about a chance meeting by Aneas and Odysseus, done in a more modern linguistic style. Given that Homer and other writers for the time period wrote in formal language that was not usually used in conversational language, I could very well get involved in the fat Odyseus (who was obviously a take off on fat Andy Dalziel).<br />Hill delves farther into the minds, psyches and lives of the women surrounding Dalziel and Pascoe. Did someone get on his case concerning being fair to the female gender? It's not absolutely necessary for him to abandon his usual protagonists, and cater to the feminist leanings of his readers. Just keep writing well, and most of us willbe happy!<br />Karen Sadler	2002-07-31

I really usually enjoy reading about emerging viruses. I tend to read a lot of nonfiction anyway, and I have background in viruses in medical school and working in a HIV lab for four years and with the pseudorabies virus. This time, I just couldn't get into this particular book. Baker did not provide the good science writing that I am used to looking for...the book was very hard to read, very hard to get through. He doesn't have the way with words say of Oliver Sacks, the passion of Stephen Jay Gould, the sense of humor of Issac Asmivov, the sense of need and importance of Richard Rhodes or Richard Preston or Laurie Garrett. This book is in hand and going to the library. Maybe someone else will enjoy it more than I, but I cannot recommend this book to my hearing colleagues or my deaf students (which is why I keep good science books). <br />The story itself concerning pfisteria is interesting, which is why I got the book in the first place. I just think it could have been better done. Unlike with the above mentioned authors, this particular book published in 1998, has gone through its hardcover and other editions, and disappeared from sight. To me, that is indicative that the book did not prove to resonate with its reading public, that it didn't 'prove' the importance of the subject matter being written about. If the author managed to convince some readers that this was a piece of fiction rather than nonfiction, something definitely went wrong in the writing or the presentation of the book. Part of that may have been the publisher's fault for the picture slapped on the paperback, the title of the book, and the trying to market this book as a 'scare-monger' piece. Good writing of the actual facts, the people involved always get my attention much better than a 'bloody front cover'!<br />Karen Sadler<BR>Science Education<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-07-31

Since 1990, the proliferation of legal mandates, lawsuits for and on behalf of the disabled, changes in educational inclusion programs, accessibility to technology, etc. has made it nearly impossible for one person to find all the pertinent information. Mr. Thomas Barich and DND Press have finally compiled in one CD, most of the documents and information currently available concerning disability rights, access, and law. This phenomenal resource is an essential tool for all those interested in this topic in the United States. Barich has provided a means to access this information without needing to resort to browsing the Internet, or flipping from site to site merely to find specific wording of government documents, find current legal rulings, or look for the status of particular disabilities in regards to educational access. <br /> This CD contains all the information needed for parents, educators, social workers, lawyers, and others who come into contact with those with disabilities. It provides up-to-date information concerning building access requirements and provisions for acoustics in classrooms for deaf students, visual access to assistive technology, and much more. The CD even provides sample cost estimates for hardware as required by law. It also provides indexes and information on individual topics such as Albinism, Asperger's Syndrome, deafness, genetics, and more, with means of connecting to organizations and journals dealing with each individual subject online. There are over 2,500 links to sites dealing with the diverse disabilities, and that makes this CD by far the most comprehensive resource available.  <br /> As anyone who has done research on disabilities online knows, the information available out there is staggering in sheer number. Often,it is difficult to find pertinent information, especially about little known disabilities or on subjects that are rarely written about in the media, such as museum access. Barich does a wonderful job incorporating this information in such a manner, as to make it readily available. The CD is very easy to use, and provides means to go backwards and forwards. It also utilizes current technology to search and locate, as well as a comprehensive index, glossary with current definitions (they change according to the political climate and political correctness). Specific words looked for are backlit in the documents, making it easier to tell if particular documents are relevant to the searcher's needs. <br /> This CD is an evolving work of progress. As more information comes available, more legal mandates are ruled upon by the Supreme Court, more changes are implemented in schools and buildings, this CD will also continue to change. Even so, the CD is much easier to deal with and carry around than the currently available books. I highly recommend this CD not just to the usual suspects as listed in the book description, but also to parent-advocates, organizations for the disabled, college students and other educators doing research, social workers, individuals with disabilities, etc. in order to protect their rights and the rights of their children. This is a truly wonderful and comprehensive resource.	2002-07-28
1463810:US	53067930	R3IJOWID0KI2TB	1574881507	987903002	While Cannons Roared: The Civil War Behind the Lines	Books	5	5	5	N	N	The way history should be taught...(but isn't)!	As usual, I was browsing looking for something else in history and biography and I 'came' across this slim volume. In looking at the reviews and the sample pages of this book, I could see that both the writing of the history and the format used by the author was something that probably would appeal to me. I was right!<br />I take it that John M. Taylor is a known writer of Civil War history, and that much of his work is in prominent journals on military history. This book contains a series of vignettes into the &quot;history behind the history&quot;...the small stories about the men involved (both politicians and soldiers), and about things that happened behind the lines that impacted what happened ON the lines. <br />One of my major complaints with history as taught in the schools, is the boring aspects of it. The same crucial facts are taught over and over again, mainly because the teachers are teaching to the tests (or to the texts). My civics classes in high school were taught that way, but I ended up in advanced placement European history in my senior year in PA. That year and that particular teacher (who loved history) instilled a curiosity about and love for history (when done right).<br />Especially in American history and with so many children of immigrants attending our schools, it is absolutely vital that they learn not just the dates, the numbers involved, the major documentation (Bill of Rights, Gettysburg Address) but of the people involved. The small insights into the people such as brought out in this book (that Lincoln paid for a substitute, which I didn't know was done on a regular basis: about individual generals who made large mistakes in judgement as well as small and important acts of courage)...if students are regaled with these stories, they will remember the history for a lifetime, not just for the current testing period. It is those stories that I was told, such as about the woman who lost five sons in the Civil War to whom Lincoln wrote apersonal letter, that I retain 30 years later. When students become personal involved in the history being taught and see the people involved as real 3-D personages, then history comes alive for them.<br />As a nation, we bemoan the fact that our children, our schools do not do the job expected of them...that is, they do not learn or retain what they've learned. Part of this is the fault of those providing the textbooks as well as the teachers in the field. A teacher of history must love his subject matter, must constantly be reading about it, and must not be teaching in lecture format from boring textbooks. Parents should not complain, if they never pick up a historical book themselves, and provide the necessary example that learning is a lifetime project, and that history is vital to our interests today.<br />Taylor does a great job in writing. I've rarely read such accessible Civil War history. I would highly recommend this book to enactors, to history buffs, to readers of military texts, to educators, and to those of us who just want to know more about our country and the freedoms our ancestors fought for. I intend to search out other books by Taylor now that I am familiar with his books, and hope others do the same.<br />Karen L. Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-07-25
1474312:US	53067930	ROOXCFRTF73K	0440209358	283575573	Bones and Silence (Dalziel and Pascoe Mysteries (Paperback))	Books	4	19	20	N	N	Interesting, with an ending I am still not sure about...	Regardless of other reviewers and the difficulty of Hill's linguistic excursions sometimes, Hill is still one of the top producers of well-written mysteries of this current batch. This particular book had its good points and its bad points, but overall the book was a great read. I enjoyed the introductions that use the York Cycle of Mystery Plays. Apparently, like many other European countries such as Germany, theatricals explaining the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, and in this particular group of plays, the period of creation and Lucifer's involvement in free agency, was used because people at that time simply could not pick up the Bible and read it. It was written in Latin, and only the clergy (and some royalty) had the ability to read. I expect that these theatricals were an extremely popular change of pace from the daily grind and I look forward to learning more concerning them, now that Hill has brought them to my attention.<br />As usual Dalziel is his perturbing, acidic, and curmudgeonly self. He doesn't like it when he ends up on the other side as a witness to a crime, that he's having a heck of a time proving actually happened as a homicide and not an accident. Like most of us, we don't like it when the shoe is on the other foot, and Dalziel doesn't take well to being seen as wrong. In the end...well...that would ruin the story. Not going to give it away. Pascoe has his own set of problems to deal with. He's still recuperating from the last case that nearly killed him, and his more sensitive psyche has taken a beating. His wife gets him involved in some of her pet projects, which he is not crazy about...but it ends up being of some assistance to providing keys of understanding to Dalziel's witnessed crime, and to the person who is writing Dalziel letters about her future self-inflicted demise. <br />This side story confuses a few readers, but life is never so tidy as to give us one problem at a time. IF it were, I think more crimes and problems would be solved. Dalziel can't be bothered with figure out who the looney is who is writing him suicide notes (and the writer knows this). But as usual, Pascoe gets saddled with this annoying problem, and it weighs on him. I really am not sure what happened at the end...but it was certainly not what I expected.<br />A sign of a good writer for me is one where I deliberately go back and look for his other books, rather than just browsing through and picking up a mystery that 'looks' good. I did that for too long, and it ends up wasting my time. When I want a good writer with a good plot and decent characters, I know where to go look for one. Hill still has plenty I have not read yet. Time to go get another!<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-07-15
1477856:US	53067930	R2A19W8L5IWOKY	068483183X	316888011	Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament	Books	5	295	322	N	N	Outstanding analysis of tie between bipolar & creativity	Ok...let's get some things straight right off the bat. This book by Jamison is NOT a book meant for the easy reading of those who are trying to find out more about bipolar disease (whether or not they are merely curious or actually have been diagnosed with it themselves!). This book is an excellent qualitative case studies argument for professionals and peers (in education, in psychology, in neuroscience, in the art world, etc.) who would like to further delve into the long-circulated theory that those blessed with creative abilities are often cursed with manic-depressive (bipolar disorder). Those lay people who merely want confirmation of their illness (or that of a family member) are going to be in for an incredible disappointment if they 'get' this book. It was never intended to be a self-help diary, no matter what Jamison's previous books on bipolar have been like.<br />Next...Jamison makes an excellent case for the link between bipolar disorder and creativity. The methodology she uses tends to be dependent upon case studies of particular artists and the information available from their own writings as well as their family backgrounds and family lineage. It is a well-known fact that many of the psychiatric disorders have both a genetic and an environmental component. Jamison obviously is learned enough and has enough background in neuroscience and psychiatry, to be able to tie the information often gleaned separately in these fields, together in a more comprehensive whole. No, Jamison does not prove beyond a shadow of a doubt the concept that many writers/artists are plagued by bipolararity...but she sure makes a heck of a case for the previously surmised existence of a link! Her science information is impeccable, given what is known now at this particular time concerning manic-depression and the brain. In spite of having to use historical accounts and letters of family members, the artists themselves, and those in direct contact with these people...Jamison's analysis of their work and art, in conjunction with that historical writing, and using what is known now about this particular disorder in the brain is an phenomenal act of intelligent and scholarly writing. And it is well-written and not typical-boring textbook (or 'let's-slap-ourselves-on-the-back-in-congratulatory' professorial type) either! That's high praise on my part, since I cannot abide professors who pander their own writing (whether textbooks or journals) or write to their colleagues in as hard-to-understand professional jargon as possible, and then demand their poor students attempt to make sense of it (as well as line the professors pockets!) Cynical, aren't I?<br />I had seen and heard of Jamison's work before, but this was the first opportunity I had had to pick up one of her books. Since having not only two artistic grandfathers (one of whom fit the mold of those in this book) as well as having a good per cent of my own family history done (and being linked to some very famous depressives and manic depressives on both sides like Mary Todd Lincoln)...my interest has always been piqued by this theory. My first three years in college gave me a great background in British and American literature, and I remember reading William Blake and thinking 'this guy straddles the world between being one of the major prophetic poets, and being stark-raving loonie'!<BR>Jamison really confirmed what I had previously thought by giving more background into the lives of these men and women. Plus she ties in the what is known about their placement into insane asylums and into their deaths at their own hands (as well as dependence upon alcohol or other drugs to relieve their depression...they rarely wanted to ease their mania which in itself is another confirmation of their own recognizance of their problems).<br />Jamison watches the speculation, that I find abhorent in historical research. She makes no claims that this is the final word on these people...she cannot. She knows and admits this. But her immense work in this area provides significant input into the lives and works of these men. It makes all of us, whether in the medical world, the educational world, or the artistic world appreciate the art and writings of these men even more because of the knowledge of what they went through.<br />Karen L.

It is so great to pick up a modern mystery from Hill that has current problems mixed well with the British linguistic skills and which returns to the lucid story-telling origins of British writers of this particular genre. After all, for most intents and purposes, the British were the ones who invented and solified this genre, and who have provided the best examples of excellent writing in it. Hill will probably have his name added to this distinquished group. Other reviewers have complained about Hill's tendency to 'show off' his language skills, but it is not really about showing off. It's about the quality of education that is achieved for many (if not most) in England in comparision to what we achieve here. I suspect if educators (I am one) in the U.S. spent as much time on increasing the reading and writing levels of our own students, the other subject matters (science, math, history, geography) would be easier to reach literacy skills in. An author of the level of Reginald Hill indicates that reading is a skill practiced way beyond that required in the states...to the point that reading becomes an essential part of the life, so this type of language useage comes naturally to Hill. If only we could achieve this in the U.S.!<br />Lately, I've been coming across many books, both fiction and nonfiction with information concerning World War I. I get the feeling I'm being pointed in this direction, and I am not sure why. I always thought from my previous historical research that the Civil War in the U.S. was the bloodiest and most disgusting war...all this input concerning WWI is rapidly changing my mind. This is one of the first books that have brought the political climate of that time period (as well as the political/social feelings towards WWI currently in Britain) to the fore. I agree with Hill that the mindset of the politicians and generals who manipulated the young men and media at home for their own purposes, belong up there with Hitler and other tyrants who used their own people for the wrong reasons. I think at this point, I can safely add to this group of despicable people, the corporate monsters from ENRON, WORLDCOM, and other American corporations who put profit and greed, before moral standards. <br />Actually, we do Hill's story a disservice when we only include Dalziel and Pascoe as the main protagonists in Hill's plot devices. I am finding out that the sargeant, Wield, is equally as necessary in many of the stories and he provides great insight into his boss and his friend, as well into the regular folks he has more direct contact with. Ellie, Pascoe's wife, seems to be becoming more important in some stories, and she definitely is involved in this one. Her insight as a woman with social causes provides not only background, but also provides a touch of relative normality for Pascoe. Her insight into his mind and his obsessions, allows her to provide tidbits of information that he can use to make informed decisions. Even Dalziel grudgingly admires her input in certain cases.<br />Having worked in medical labs, I am all too aware of the rabid cause of animal rights groups. I was lucky in that my work was done on human cells, rather than animals (I purposely avoided it as I too love animals but I also realized medical strides often cannot be made without some animal experimentation). The plot device in this book where someone sought to make use of animal activism to cover up scandals makes an incredible amount of sense. With all the corporate irresponsibility being shown in the U.S. at this point, it should not surprise anyone to find companies using animal rights and environmentalism to cover up their own wrongs. <br />This was a wonderful read...thoroughly enjoyable all the way through!<br />Karen Sadler, <BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-07-05

I am always on the look out for decent books that can be used to teach students about phenomenal lives and mentors. This book accurately fills that need. Most of the physicians in this book were also researchers before scientific research was even a field. Many of these men (they are mostly men) came from backgrounds that were not particularly conducive to doing medicine, let alone the research that they ended up doing. Their families were not aristrocratic or learned, many had fathers who were tradesmen...yet for some reason, they chose to enter fields of medicine. Medicine was not always the prestigious field or career that it is now. Often, it was looked down upon, especially prior to its consolidation as a science. The work that these men did helped to raise the prestige of medicine, anatomy, physiology, and neuroscience. <br />Medicine, like most sciences, is a long ongoing process of learning. Not just about the body, but about what chemicals and what therapies are going to work for individuals. One of the things that this book makes clear is that those who succeeded in furthering medical knowledge all possessed great curiosity as well as often possessing great courage. So many times, these guys had to buck the current establishment, whether it was clergy, current medical knowledge (often dating back to Greece even in the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance), and even governmental authority. <br />This book is well-written, and provides a lot of diverse stories about medical achievement mainly in European countries. There are a few chapters dedicated to women and only a couple involving men from the Middle East, none from the Orient. The author does bring up alternative medicine, but since I can think of several other medical discoveries and physician/inventors from parts of the non-European world that could and should be mentioned, I think this book should be followed by another including the inspiring stories from the rest of the world. All children and all adolescents, need to see mentors, scientists, and physicians that are like them; that it is possible to achieve in this area no matter where you are from, what gender or race or ability you have. This book is a critical and good start, but it is essential to take it farther...<br />It's important for kids to have diverse meanings for the word 'hero'. With so many in the sports world, in the world of entertainment, and now in the business world providing bad examples, it is paramount that teachers and parents provide alternatives to these people as to what actually constitutes a 'hero'. So many in the media and in government lambast how poorly our students are doing in science and math education, yet part of the problem lies in the fact that adults are not providing good examples of what is important and what is not. This book helps to place this critical emphasis back on the importance of intelligence, of creativity, and of compassion for fellow human beings. A truly vital book to have for educators and those who would be mentors.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-06-26

I really think Deaver is one of the better American writers of this genre...but is it absolutely necessary to cram his stories full of offensive language? I was always taught by both my parents and my professors in writing and English, that if a writer had to resort to constant use of foul language, that those people did not have anything of import to say. It's getting to the point very quickly with Deaver that I will cease to pick up his books if he doesn't curtail the language a bit. It's not that I am prudish (ok, well maybe I am) or naive that this stuff doesn't go on in the 'real' world. As a deaf person, I am lucky. I don't have to hear this constantly. I certainly don't want to read it constantly either!<br />Having said that...I thought the plot was plausible and intriguing. I am always sad to read about the absolute indignities and dangers that immigrants risk trying to come to our country. I am also aware that we Americans tend to be less than cordial for whatever reasons, even though I figured and Deaver clarified that those coming over here from Asia are more educated and less liable to be users of our welfare system, then many of the people who have been here for centuries. <br />Deaver threw a few curveballs in here, and even though I thought about the possibility that a certain character was involved as the 'bad guy' everyone was looking for, the plot device that Deaver used ended up surprising me a bit. Other than the language, the book was enjoyable. Since Deaver is a mystery writer, I don't expect him to pad his stories a lot with romance. If I wanted that particular genre I'd look at other authors. As always, the forensic science is interesting, and Deaver keeps up-to-date with the new technology coming out involving care for quads and also assistive technology that makes it possible for those of us with disabilities to participate in the real world through computers.<br />Karen Sadler	2002-06-26

His books on medical history are a must-read for those who enjoy learning, and need to know how medical and scientific changes came about. I am one person who really feels that understand medical and social history is the only way that we can avoid the mistakes of the past, and work towards making the future as equitable in treatment and understanding towards those with mental illness as we can.<BR>Porter's book is small and a quick read. He doesn't dash through, but this is not a textbook. Nor does it cover every possible scientific and social input on what 'makes' madness and what different centuries did to deal with those with mental conditions. If the reader is looking for a first look into the history of mental illness, he cannot go wrong with reading this concisely written book. It will not answer all the questions...in fact, it raises more questions. But Porter not only gives enough information and color to this particular problem, he also gives a wonderful bibliography/reference to refer to if the reader wishes to read about any particular time or problem. I did go looking for several of his recommended books, and I have not been disappointed yet. <br />It is of great interest that I read about the early 18th century, when so many of the great philosophers impacted the view with which scientists and physicians (and family too) viewed mental illness. Porter emphasizes that the great humanitarian changes made in the care of those mentally ill occurred then...but in spite of obvious success with providing homes and medical care and even jobs to these unfortunates, the fact that this 'care' did not provide a cure and unfortunately, the input of Darwin's idea of 'survival of the fittest' as promoted by his cousin, caused these asylums to deteriorate into the snake pits of the movies. Since genetics is raising some of the same questions and answer given by the eugenists from 1870 to past WWII ... it is paramount that students and medical personnel be trained in this medical history.<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-06-13

Dalziel is a curmudgeon of the finest form. His wit is so dry, it could hold a day's worth of British rainfall. The fact that this particular plot evolved around characters who worked in libraries or worked in journalism, and university research made this book very interesting to me. I am not as smart as some of the other reviewers at guessing who the ultimate culprit was. It did come as a surprise to me, and yet it was a disappointing surprise. I cannot say much more without giving away the ending...but it didn't make sense.<br />Still, having said that, I enjoyed this book regardless. What is it about the British Educational system that manages to turn out such verbal paragons? If you like language, if you enjoy Monty Python or other typical British humor, if you like your mysteries intelligently written, Reginald Hill is the author for you...<br />Karen SAdler	2002-06-13

Reginald Hill's books on Dalziel/Pascoe make me laugh. One of the best things that can be said about any author is that they make you laugh! If they can do it while spinning a pretty good plot in the mystery genre, they have my admiration. Hill's cop-duet are an odd couple. I know the prevalence of 'odd couples' in mysteries has been done and overdone, but Hill brings a breath of fresh air to the genre with these two. I know I couldn't possibly stand either Dalziel or Pascoe alone through a whole book, hence they play off of one another to keep the reader interested and the plot interesting.<br />Now granted, every once in a while Hill feels he has to authenticate his cops with language I would prefer not to read. But...having been around some military and a few cops, I would not be surprised if they do talk like this except around women and children. Hill's books have enough good writing to make up for the occasional lapse into raunchy language. <br />This book combines not just a murder mystery but also incorporates a bit of the spy genre in here, as it involves both American CIA and British royalty in the murder. The plot becomes convoluted throughout the book since the people originally in the house at the time of the 'accidental' shooting not only do not stay in Britain, but they don't even stay married to the same people. It's a bit of a strain at times keeping people separated, but worth it.<br />I got a huge kick out of Dalziel's visit to America, and much of the language. I always have wished I had the knack of someone like Dalziel, who is an older British curmudgeon, to administer dry, humorous put-downs...I am not sure if someone like him would make it in the 'real world' without more diplomatic abilities than he seems willing to be bothered with...so he really does need Pascoe to smooth things over and 'cover his rear'. <br />A totally enjoyable reading...<br />Karen Sadler<br />University of Pittsburgh	2002-06-07

I grabbed this thinking I had read Baldacci before...I think I got my authors mixed up. I was not real thrilled to realize this was not a member of the mystery genre, but was actually and action thriller. Even though I've read plenty of Tom Clancy's books, I don't usually go looking for this type of book. The last few trips down this particular genre have not been that great. Clancy is mass producing books of this sort now, and that usually means the level of writing skill has gone down. Action-thrillers tend to be written by men and for men. That means the language is a little saltier then I like it in comparison to mysteries (especially mysteries written by the British).<br />This book started out slow, but gained momentum quickly. I was pleasantly surprised to see the language was relatively good, and the writing was excellent (I did spot several typographical errors...don't publishers check for this stuff any more?).<br />Another reader of this book stated that the plot was ridiculous. I don't think so...after 9/11 I don't think very many plots are impossible or improbable. I am sure many hold the same view as me. If you had asked me several years ago, whether we would have seen the things that occurred at Waco, in Oklahoma, the various men who have betrayed their countries and families, the ability of drug cartels to impact our society, and what happened in September of 2001...I would have said you are reading too much fictional garbage. Now, it is possible to believe the worst, not only of others, but of our society and the priorities we have.<br />Baldacci seems to be a good writer. I qualify that as I am going to have to read more of his books to see if this is a typical literary excursion for him. His story about the FBI hostage rescue team is extremely interesting. I certainly have not read anything along this line before, and I enjoyed the new information. That he had to do research on much of the book is obvious from all the people he had to thank at the end. Men and women who enjoy thrillers, people with background in the horse breeding industry, anyone who enjoys good writing and needs a break from their everyday existence will find this an excellent book to take on a trip or to the beach.<br />Karen Sadlerend.

I tend to buy books in bulk, often more than one at a time. This was one such instance where four books were bought about two months ago. This one was put aside, as I had to finish two classes and do work for the two computer web sites I work for. The other books were read and discarded, appreciated for what they were...then given to the library so others may enjoy them to. This particular book, from which I expected little, will remain in my own personal library to be lent to the few who I know can appreciate both the medicine and the literacy of this particular doctor-author.<br />Other reviewers have outlined the stories of this book. It is immediate recognized that it is a different book...it's table of content is not a one-page outline of the chapter titles. Rather each chapter is outline by a large photograph of the cell types dealt with in that chapter. The 'name' of the chapter is in small typeface below or adjacent to the electron photograph. This warns the reader that whatever they had expected from this book, is liable to be different from what they get. Thankfully, this is so...<br />Nadler is a pathologist, a man who devotes his life to diagnosing the secrets of the individual units of our bodies. Pathologists are decoders basically. They read and tell other surgeons and doctors what they have biopsied or what they have seen. Pathologists rarely have intimate contact with the people whose cells they have examined. I worked in two neuropathology labs for almost six years. It is fascinating work, but other than your fellow lab workers, there is no human contact.<br />Somehow, from reading Dr. Nadler's book, I will guarantee that this physician has made it a point throughout his life and career to purposely remain involve with individuals. Unlike some doctors who I know have much more contact with patients, thisdoctor refuses to consider the cells alone, without considering the person. Perhaps because he is not involved in the conveyor belt of modern medicine, he has not lost that compassion or steeled himself against 'feeling' too much. For that alone, he deserves accolades.<br />His language, his metaphors, the observations he makes are far beyond the abilities of most doctors, indeed beyond the abilities of most people period. Like Oliver Sacks, he brings attention to a disease through the person who is affected by that disease. In doing so, readers become aware of the courage these individuals choose to face their illness with. So many times in labs and hospitals, we forget that what we see under the microscope was once deeply embedded in an individual. Nadler reminds us exquisitely of that, and in his writing, he brings an understanding of not just the disease, but of those who must deal with these particular disease. The story told, the picture drawn...may start with the cell that he originally focused on, but Nadler quickly changes the focus to the person.<br />An outstanding book by an outstanding person...<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-05-18
1545424:US	53067930	R187BR9OB7MS30	0345432991	49782164	A Death in White Bear Lake: The True Chronicle of an All-American Town	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Original case establishing legal precedents - child abuse	I don't usually pick up books of the 'true crime' genre. I am all too aware of man's inhumanity to man through my research and work as a disability rights advocate. I do enjoy forensic science for the science information and techniques used, but even then I tend to avoid reading more than a couple of those types of books a year. I don't need to fill my brain with 'junk' or with depressing subjects.<br />Yet I am glad I picked up this book. As a mother and a grandmother, I've never really understood child abuse. I've heard many theories, and of course, in medical school (even for a PhD in neuroscience) students are exposed to this as a medical and social problem. But we didn't delve deeply into the psyche of those who abuse, and children who are abused. Since this is a topic which has always made me distinctly uncomfortable, it's not usually something I choose to read about (whether in reality or in mysteries...I stay far away from J. Kellerman for this reason).<br />Siegel is evidently a journalist, and the book is written with a very compact journalistic bent. He rarely is wordy, and as a journalist, he learned to write with a minimum of unnecessary verbal adornment. He does not mince words. Even if he cannot prove it, Siegel makes it clear that he considers the cop brother of the defendant the reason why the child's death was not prosecuted in 1965, as the cop obviously interfered with the investigation and subsequently lied about it. Journalists are just as prone to opinions as the rest of us. As long as the reader is aware of that, and the fact that their writing will have a bias (one way or another), to an extent we can accept the information as 'close' to reality.<br />This child's death is one of the first cases of child abuse to be brought to trial in the United States. I was unaware of the fact that prior to the '60s, abuse of children in regular middle-class and upper class homes was ignored. It's very difficult to read this book, not just for the fact that a woman nearly got away with the torture and death of a child, but because so many people turned away from the obvious abuse. Even though Mrs. Jurgens was the only person prosecuted, there is plenty of blame to go around. I would hope that I would never be guilty of avoiding 'involvement' in a case such as this in order to avoid discomfort or inconvenience. Thank heavens for the courage of those in authority who finally decided to prosecute this case, the natural mother for pursuing justice for her son, and especially the courage of the other adopted son of this woman who testified against her and in the process, lost what little semblance of parents he had. I hope that he has found some peace in his own life...<br />A truly well-documented case and one that we need to be aware of ...<BR>Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-05-13

Since I drifted from a 'hard' science (neuroscience) into education, I needed to relearn writing skills that were appropriate for this field.

I haven't picked up one of her books for probably two years. After a while, these prolific mystery authors who churn out a yearly contribution for wasting time on tend to repeat themselves. this time I did not find that was so. I really enjoyed the last half of the book, which exhibited all the good writer qualities that won Paretsky such a large audience in the first place. <br />The first half of the book was probably necessary to build the last half of the book. It just seemed it could have been done tighter; less words, more action, not as long. There were a few departures from the main plot as Paretsky went off on tangents, and got in a few lectures. Like many TV sitcoms which go on for too long (MASH for one)...Paretsky is falling into the usual &quot;I need to make a difference&quot; trap. This time the lecture was on women's prisons and political/financial shenanigans. This isn't to say the 'lecture' wasn't interesting, or didn't help with the plot. Just...you have to be careful. I know a lot of books, a lot of shows which have turned off their loyal audiences by overdoing the political/social good motivations of the authors or the writers of TV scripts.<br />This was an enjoyable book. The last half sped by quickly. Warshwski is getting older, like all of us. The body is failing to respond as she wants it, and her concerns about being alone and not having the wherewithal to support herself in old age is a fear that faces many throughout the U.S. It's nice to see an established author facing reality of aging on her protagonist, so the rest of us don't feel so lacking! <br />Karen Sadler,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-05-07

I've become an avid reader of medical history. When in medical school for my degree in neuroscience, my favorite class was one that dealt with the neurological basis of psychiatric disorders. The professor had MDs come in with a patient with a particular problem (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, anorexia) and we would have the opportunity to listen to them tell their own story and their frustrations with their illness. <br />When they brought in a girl who was probably 5'8\\" and weight 78 pounds, it was fascinating to see the guys in the class who were normally very vocal and aggressive, totally shut up! From behind she looked like someone from a Nazi concentration camp, yet she continued to consider herself 'fat'. When she left, the MD had the nerve to turn around and tell the boys, that basically...anorexia was the fault of men. All of us were stunned. He put up an obviously much used power point slide showing the weights of women in both Playboy magazines and in the Miss USA pageant from the beginning to that year (1997). The line was steep and steady from the upper left-hand corner of the slide to the bottom right corner of the slide. This was the change in weight of the women who were participating in these 'endeavors' that the MD said were run by men (it was a male MD). Then he went further and said...most women's magazines are still mainly male bastions, as is the fashion industry both here and in Europe. The men in the class were absolutely horrified (and the women were thrilled that someone had the nerve to say this to them!)<br />This outstanding book is a must read for anyone going into psychology, neuroscience, working with adolescents, education, public health, etc. I've read few books with such deep understanding as to the history and ramifications of social mores on young women and girls. Since I am a mother and a grandmother of girls, I have been truly horrified at picking up Bazaar magazine in the doctor's office and seeing what they are promoting as beingbeautiful. I told them to remove that magazine, because the models in it were way beyond Twiggy-skinny. When society promotes models whose bones are showing through their pelvic in whatever they wear, then something has gone desparately wrong in our society.<br />I am not a feminist per se, but I do believe in equal rights for all. Yet, viewing this particular disorder is a feminist need, and Brumberg does that magnificently, without overdoing it or carping on feminist thinking. I wish more 'feminists' would express deep concern and become activists to change our society from it's obviously deep-seated biases towards what constitutes beauty, for the sake of our girls. This is definitely more important in controlling and curtailing than almost any other societal gender-related bias...because it is literally killing our young women.<br />Brumberg's ability to write medical history is phenomenal. This is definitely one of the finest books I've read in this genre. Her research is meticulous; I was surprised and impressed with the sheer amount of information she provides concerning this problem during the 19th century. Many in the medical profession still believe that this disorder is something brought on by our society in the 20th century, but she shows that anorexia has been with us for a long time. I highly recommend this book!<BR>Karen SAdler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-05-01

It is so nice to find an American who can write with the seemingly innate beautiful language abilities of the British. I am very curious as to where the author, Charles Todd, went to school. I find it difficult to believe that an American public school turned out someone with the ability to write as this many does. Maybe he attended private schools...but I will bet that he is an avid reader. It shows through in his own writing.<br />Todd's series involving an English detective after World War I are unique. Many people write period mysteries, few pull it off. It's difficult to draw a picture of that time period in so few words that will not clash or take away from the mystery. Todd manages to do that. When the reader becomes involved in thes story, it's almost as if someone reaches above the reader's head and manages to dim the light. Todd draws graphics with words, giving the reader a sense of stepping back into another world...time slows down, the bustle we are used to in this day and age disappear, the difference of how people treated one another, the destitution left by a war and the 1918 outbreak of influenza on not only material goods but on the people in England...all of this and more is conveyed by Todd's writing.<br />I really enjoyed this mystery. It moves at a pace in keeping with the time period. Rutledge's problem with his 'inner voice,' Hamish (a Scot who was a member of Rutledge's troop who died) is less obvious in this book. I did not find Hamish's presence to be a bother...actually, knowing what I do from medical school about acute traumatic events on the brain, it actually makes sense. Even though Hamish is still present, he seems to be losing his control over Rutledge's mind. Or rather Rutledge seems to be gaining more control over his own thoughts, which you would expect to happen. The story about a deeply troubled family is very convoluted, but for all that it makes for enjoyable reading...<br />Karen Sadler<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-04-28

Another author who apparently has a thriving cadre of fans. Unfortunately, this book did not add me to them. The book isn't that bad...but it isn't that good either. The plot dealing with a father who tries to make-up for lost time with his daughter by confessing to a murder he didn't commit because he fears his daughter did, is actually quite a good plot. It's definitely a plot I have not read before, and with the increasing amount of parents who are workaholics, the plot is plausible.<br />However, Scottoline never quites visualize the characters. One of the first things I look for in a mystery, is whether I can see the characters in my mind's eye. With this particular mystery, the only character which was visual for me was the 16 year old daughter. The rest, the father, the female lawyer, the two main cops involved in the case were not only stereotype, but they never became three dimensional for me.<br />The romance part between the female lawyer and the suspect never materializes at all. I felt it was just tacked on to the rest of the story for readers who want romance in their mysteries, and to explain one reason why the lawyer kept investigating on her own. <br />That Scottoline can write is obvious in little snippets here and there in the story. Every once in a while, Scottoline inserts a paragraph or a few sentences that are much better than the book on a whole. There are moments of clarity and description of people and situations, which indicate that if money and fame were not the only objective, Scottoline could write much better. Maybe she needs to try her hand at writing a genre other than mysteries that would allow her abilities to shine...	2002-04-05

You know something is wrong when you have to force yourself to finish a book. As anyone can see from my reviews, I am hardly illiterate, nor do I turn up my nose at most genres (except romances!) At one point, I enjoyed Anne Perry's books, but this one was incredibly disjointed, needlessly wordy, the plot needed work, and the characters never take on a semblance of reality. Sometimes I wonder if some of these writers get so use to a certain lifestyle and a certain audience who adores them, that they no longer enjoy writing and they are merely churning out the books for the money. Maybe I am way off bat here, but I have become increasing disgruntled with lazy authors, whether it be in hacked out mysteries, or historical biographers who plagiarize the works of others. If it isn't worth the time to do the job right, then don't do that job...<br />If the reader wants safe reading, if they want to get preached at (the topic for this particular book was racial prejudice against Jews...which I totally agree needs to be brought up again for another generation...but not so obviously!) If the reader wants a dark historical mystery that doesn't demand thinking on the part of the reader...then I guess this book is okay.

Because I am biased for reading science anyway, I tend to like it when a scientist can manage to write a book which uses language well and who can do it with a sense of humor towards himself and his fellow scientists. Baden and Roach do this very well in this book. I inhaled the book, rather than merely reading it. It isn't the smallest tome on this stuff that I've picked up, but it definitely is the quickest I've read one of these. That I was disappointed at the end because it wasn't enough indicates the <BR>wealth of the writing and the abilities of the authors.<br />Along with other reviewers, I really got a kick out the forensic entomologist in Indiana.

Apparently the field is loaded with practical jokers, which doesn't surprise me. Having been in classes in the morgue with a doctor who loved to torture my sign language interpreters...I totally understand the need for humor in these situations. This entomologist sounds like subject matter for a book of his own. I also enjoyed the section on Henry Lee, probably the most famous forensic criminologist. I'd read his stuff before, and it was not as enjoyable as this book. But I gained a lot of respect for his talents from Baden's obvious admiration for the man.<br />This book is an excellent educator. This is an expanding field of endeavor for several reasons, not the least of which is more people equals more deaths. And our society is not getting any less violent. I think the happenings of September 11th and the subsequent need to be able to identify the victims of terrorist attacks has made it clear we need more scientists in this area. I would wish that Baden and his colleagues who are able to write well and speak well would make themselves available to speak to large groups of young people. He treats his 'patients' and their families with respect.We need that respect filtered down to high school and college students, to perhaps make them think more carefully about their life choices and the impact they have on others.<br />Great book!...	2002-03-22

I've said it before, and I will say it again. I hate Statistics! It is not just that statistics originated as a means to classify and rank people according to their perceived social worth. Statistics is still used that way as evidenced by the publication and use of the book The Bell Curve. In comparision to a pure science like Neuroscience and also to mathematics, statistics is a subjective science. Everyone knows that statistics can be manipulated and used to show whatever the researcher wants to show...and it is more prone to abuse then most other hard sciences and math.<br />Ok, having said that...I had to take a statistics course at the last minute (read that last year) while working on my dissertation, because it was determined I did not have enough measurements classes. This book was required, but it really has not been used as much as the other textbook which is equation-based, but I quickly found that I preferred this book!<br />This textbook explains how and why statistics are used in all sciences, social sciences, etc. and how they are to be interpreted when seen in a journal. It is very concise...the authors for once are not writing for their peers, they are writing for their audience (which are going to be students, grad students, patient/consumers, etc). The book is written with an eye towards helping the reader understand the reasoning and logic behind using statistics. It is done with minimal decorative writing, and with a sense of humor. It makes use of good examples of both good and bad statistic use in papers and journals, it lambasts those who need lambasting, and it has a sense of humor.<br />If you have to understand statistics so you can read medical journals, sociology, educational journals, etc. this is the book to get. It is immensely helpful. I will rid my library of all other statistical books, but this one I will keep (since my statistics outside of class will be either on computers or I will do qualitative research!)<BR>Karen Sadler,<br/>Science Education,<BR>University of PIttsburgh	2002-03-18

Short, sweet, and somewhat hilarious rendition for one of our better known epidemiological chapters in american history. I was taken aback by the negative comments of the other readers of this book and I am afraid I do not agree. Having a deep and abiding interest in epidemiology and public health as far as the deaf and disability communities are concerned, there is more than one way to approach a story like this. Probably the first time anyone has taken Mary's point of view on this whole fiasco. <br />Bourdain didn't mean for this to be a textbook on public health. It is a story about a cook, somewhat along the lines of a modern Chaucer (which is high praise from me, since I love Chaucer's viginettes about characters during the Middle Ages). I realized this going into this book, but perhaps others were disappointed thinking they were going to receive something delving into more of the history and less of an individual biography.<br />This book is worth the short time it takes to read it. It's one of those books that makes you snort with laughter, and then feel guilty about it since many people got sick and a few died from Mary's little forays into the hot and dirty kitchens of New York at the turn of the century. Bourdain explains how Mary must have seen this invasion of her privacy from what little information provided by her and those who knew her. It should not be surprising that she had a bit of a 'persecution complex'. With all of our emphasis on individual rights and protection from Big Brother, you would think more readers would understand Mary's feelings about her situation?<br />Bourdain certainly has a unique view for what happened. I think he shows immense talent and compassion, for presenting this story in a different way. If you want to read a textbook history or about emerging viruses, this is not for you. But if you enjoy historical books from a unique standpoint, and a sense of humor in writing about serious topics, this book is definitely a must-have. Bourdain does do research into the areas he is greatly interested in, such as America's obsession with food...the menus from that time period and the explanation about the use of all animal parts was enough to make me gag.

I'd forgotten I'd read one of Thayer's books before, but I recognized his writing immediately. This was a terrific who-done-it. Unlike many mysteries I am having a more difficult time getting through lately, this book was difficult to put down (especially when I am stuck on my dissertation process!) Thayer is a good writer, and the info on the Lindbergh crime was terrific. I've read quite a bit of it, but I am determined to read more of Anne Morrow Lindbergh's writing from that time. The compassion with which this story is handled is necessary. I hate to see anyone make money off of a horrific crime, even with most of the individuals involved dead. I wish other authors of true crime would have half of the awareness to spare those family members of both the victim's family and the perpetrator of the crime, rather than focusing on their own need to make money or tell a tale.<br />I liked this book much more than the Weatherman. The plot is unique (someone wants to do the Lindbergh crime over again and get it right this time)...and the characters are better drawn. At some places in the book, it does get confusing because of so many people drawn into the account. I also figured out about half way through who the perpetrators probably were, but it was not a disappointment when it was confirmed, since I wanted to know the reasons why anyone would do something like that. Talk about twisted logic! Hope Thayer doesn't give the whackos out there any ideas!<BR>Karen Sadler,<br />University of Pittsburgh	2002-03-18

Ok, first off...no where on the front of the book did it indicate that these were short stories, rather than a full mystery. That is my major complaint. I grabbed the book thinking that since it was Reginald Hill, it was a full mystery. After I read the first story, then I read the back! If the reader prefers a full mystery, then don't get this book!!!<br />Other than that, and the fact that short stories do not have the time to well develop a mystery plot (my own opinion), I enjoyed Hill's writing. He may not have the plot time in here, but he does develop the characters. Pascoe and Dalziel are a hilarious couple in many ways. Dalziel is an old British curmudgeon, who never ceases to surprise the reader and Pascoe. <br />The first three stories were pretty good, the last with a mystery based on the moon wasn't as well done. Part of it is trying to write what we expect the future to be like, and that is hard to do. If you base your expectations on science fiction writers like Wells, Verne, Orwell, etc. we are already behind on some things and ahead on others (establishment of space travel versus communications and information retrieval). I am not crazy about mixing the two genres (mystery and science fiction).<br />But Hill is a good writer. For those who run out of other stuff to read, this book is good enough for a glance...<BR>Karen Sadler	2002-03-08

I've read many of the previous case studies of languagelessness in children. We studied Genie and the Wild Boy of Aveyron in an education class on language and it's place in education. This was my introduction to this particular group of disenfranchised, neglected, and abused people...except I thought it was all children usually discovered in late childhood (around age 13). From my neuroscience classes I remember being taught that the brain continues neuronal growth (to targeted synapses in the brain) until about age ten, then begins to cut back. This was supposedly an explanation for why language learning is so difficult later in life. So coming across this book, with its story concerning adults with no obvious psychiatric problems (just a physical difference in lacking hearing) who had managed to survive to adulthood with no language, came as a complete surprise.<br />This book got put aside as I had to read other books for school and work, but I picked it up again and finished it. Schaller basically is providing a qualitative study, a case study, to draw attention to this apparent problem. This method of educational research is used more and more in writing dissertations, and I actually didn't recognize what it was until I took a qualitative research class myself. The writing and book tend at first to repeat itself. I am not sure what Schaller was doing in writing this way. Perhaps the book had to be a certain length or she felt readers might not pay attention to the seriousness of this problem for Ildefonso and other adults without language. This repetition caused the first half of the book to drag a bit.<br />After I picked the book up again, I finished it in two days. The addition of the search for other adults with no primary language, Schaller's introduction to other adults like Ildefonso, and then her search for Ildefonso really added to the pace of the case study. <br />This book throws a bit of a wrench in much of the things I have been taught in both neuroscience and education. There are a few things the book illustrates better than any other book I've read on this topic. First, given the amount of adults who were deaf and had no language that Schaller found in Southern California really illustrates this has to be a major problem internationally. If we are finding such a large group in our nation which pushes education and literacy, what about in countries such as China where there are many deaf (due to overuse of gentamycin) and there are many people with no access to education. Second, again, we obviously don't know everything there is to know about the pliability of the brain. Third, I am very concerned about discrimination against this group, and the possibilities that there are many of these people in psychiatric wards or prisons or other institutions, merely because they have no way to assert their rights. This possibility would be criminal.<br />I'd like to see more books by Schaller on this topic, and hope to learn more about this in the future. For the most part, this is a great book, and it definitely is a great story which needed to be told.<BR>Karen Sadler<BR>Science Education<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-03-04
1637011:US	53067930	R3ORMEDCFDZSYH	0312971281	706753887	Search the Dark: An Inspector Ian Rutledge Mystery (Ian Rutledge Mysteries)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	An unusual plot for an unusual man...	I discovered Todd's books through recommendations from Amazon.com, and for that I thank them. Todd writes about a world that disappeared almost a century ago. It is due to his writing abilities that that world is recreated again for his readers. I pick up one of his books, and immediately my mind settles into a simpler, but dark time of history after WWI. Rutledge is a different protagonist, who brings with him into his cases both the knowledge of human goodness and the inhumanity of man that he learned from his war experience.<br />Rutledge keeps quiet concerning his shadow presence, Hamish. The world was a lot less forgiving of mental illness back in those decades then it is even now. Hamish's presence in these books apparently bothers some readers, yet it is partly his presence which differentiates these books from others of this genre. Those who have studied psychiatry and neuroscience are aware of the different coping mechanisms used by those exposed to massive trauma, and few wars have dealt out the type of trauma the young men from England were exposed to during WWI.<br />The plot of this book is another ripple effect of the war. Those who made it back alive, not always made it back whole...even if their bodies appeared unscathed. And the impact of the war touched all of those families and towns, including the women. Many families, mothers and wives who expected a return to normality, were asked to deal with sons and husbands who returned with massive psychological problems. Many of them had to deal with these problems on their own without professional help, and also find a way to provide for their families.<br />Todd does an excellent job of writing. This particular book moved slowly, but then that world did move slower than the world we live in now, with its technological marvels and information glut. He writes with intelligence and with respect for the readers, expecting us to show a modicum of interest in Rutledge's life experience and in our own history.As an American, I am pleased to see that at least one of our own native writers can write as well as many British writers do.<BR>Karen Sadler<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-02-28

This is one of the most poignant biographies that I have ever read. As with most teenagers in the late 60's and in the 70's, Anne's diary was required reading in our highschool. I remember reading it, but not paying the attention I should have, because as a teenager, her story seemed to be a part of a world that no longer existed. Teenagers cannot appreciate the reality of that time, and though I grew up during the angst of the civil rights era and the Vietnamese War, it was not until some other life happenings occurred that I can now appreciate her story. This includes becoming a mother and an activist for disability rights, and seeing for myself in small and distant ways, man's inhumanity to man.<br />Muller did an exquisite job in the biography. She avoided speculation, which seems to be a problem for writers of biographies. Anne's story cannot be fully appreciated without more knowledge of her family and the people who protected them. As Anne and her father lived without bitterness for their fate, so too did Melissa Muller write with patience and understanding far beyond the abilities of most of us. <br />The book is eloquent in its simple praise for the goodness of people who made the right choices during that conflict between good and evil. I hope that reading of the courage of Miep Gies and her husband, and the others in the business formerly owned by Otto Frank, will inspire all of its readers to stand up for what is right whatever situation we may find ourselves in.<br />My heart still aches for the waste of human potential. And yet, Anne fulfilled so much of that potential and continues to inspire long after her life was over. Much of my heartache was felt for her parents, who in their desire to be with their children, left it until too late to get their children to safety. I understand their choices, and I know they must have lived with the knowledge that they put their children at great risk and berated themselves. <br />My admiration for the people in Holland and other occupied countries who helped those singled out for destruction on the basis of race and prejudice is immense. I continue to be surprised at how much was done by people who were not perfect, and at their own risk. This is a near perfect biography, in writing and in intelligence. I wish there were more like this out there...<BR>Karen Sadler<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-02-25
1649203:US	53067930	R2QBQ1GC2CTA8D	0425176037	622439136	Shell Game (A Mallory Novel)	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Extremely complicated story...almost too much so!	I remember how much I really enjoyed the first couple of books by O'Connell. She introduced the female character Mallory, who is so multifaceted in personality and characteristics due to her very different childhood. Up til this book, both the characterization of people and plot development were very well handled by O'Connell. This time the author came up short. I don't know why. O'Connell doesn't churn these mysteries out as fast as she can like some other female writers of the mystery genre. <br />This book is not a bad read. Compared to many other authors who do churn out mysteries on a bi-annual basis, this book is a masterpiece. Yet, if the reader compares this book to O'Connell's first few books, they will be a mite disappointed. <br />There are way too many characters. Not only was the plot very complicated due to it having to do with WWII and a group of magicians, but there were too many characters to keep track of. On top of that, it is obvious O'Connell did a lot of research into certain illusions, which for someone who has no background in magic ended up being very confusing. <br />More was revealed about Mallory's background and how she thinks. This was probably the best part of the book. Yet the development of her two 'buddies', Riker the cop and Charles, the man who is Mallory's friend, was almost absent. They were placed in the book as an afterthought. There were six magicians originally, and though all were present during WWII, in the future, the now that exists for Mallory and gang, two are dead (and includes the 'original' murder victim), and the rest seem to be involved in a conspiracy. Not only do we find out that there was a much earlier murder victim, but the readers are expected to keep track of the variety of illusions, the history of all these men, and their backdrop (which was WWII). It ended up being too much, and I had a difficult time keeping track of everything.<br />I am hoping this is a one-time fluke. Not every book can be a hole-in-one, and this book can be enjoyed for the intelligence with which it is written. I would recommend readers go to her other books, if they want a better example of what O'Connell is capable of.<BR>Karen Sadler<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-02-19

Not math, simply statistics. I am sure my opinions on this topic have been tainted by the books on eugenics, which I have been reading for the last two years. Having said that, I was told I needed to take a couple of measurement classes to fill my requirements for my Ph.D. (at the last minute of course...)<br />Two books were required reading for this course. One was this book, and the other is Reading Statistics and Research by Huck.<BR>I'll 'get' to that book later.<br />This book is another typical example of a textbook that was written not to provide understandable explanations of its topic to the students who are required to buy it. Rather, it seems to be written to impress the professors and other professionals who are in the same field. It is bad enough that the book does a poor job of explaining. It skips all over the place, and uses language in such a manner as to make statistics more difficult than it absolutely needs to be. When the students read paragraphs over and over again, and still have to ask the professor for an explanation (and he provides one in a simple sentence), then something is very wrong about the text.<br />Not only that, but the book is chock-full of typographical errors. In many places the profesor in my class had to draw our attention to an equation which was wrong. Other typos include wrong answers obtained for data used (when everyone in the class gets the same answer and its not the one in the book you begin to wonder who proof-read this thing!) Another place, the printing got lighter and lighter, and there were equal signs missing...	2002-02-19

It's so rare to pick up a modern author from this genre (mystery) and have his talent as a wordsmith be so exquisite. If I seem effusive concerning this book, you will have to excuse me. When you get stuck reading a lot of badly written textbooks, and other material whether books or journals for profesional purposes, when you do pick up a good mystery (based on recommendations from Amazon.com--thanks guys!) it is nice to be able to dive into a story which is not only a good mystery, but the writing itself is wonderful.<br />The British have a way with the English language. I don't know what is in the water over there, but I am increasingly finding that my tastes are generally more satisfied when reading British mysteries. And I am not talking Agatha Christie here, though I've read stuff that far back. Hill is an obvious contender for those who enjoy P.D. James mysteries, as well as historical mysteries of the type written by Charles Todd (I keep forgetting he is American).<br />This story is painstakingly drawn out. It's a hefty mystery, and frankly, Hill did a great job by not allowing the reader to determine who was responsible for the disappearance of several young girls. I made several errors in judgement, that were solved (sensibly thank heavens) in the last three chapters. Rarely do I get up out of bed at night and spend three hours in a chair to finish reading a book which I just cannot put down. But I did this with this author.<br />I am looking forward to his other books...it is great to find another author with many books to his name that I can enjoy for a while (I read so fast usually that I go through good authors too quick and have to find another one).	2002-02-08

I get a huge kick out of Bruce Alexander's mysteries involving a blind judge and his young sidekick. I've read a lot of history from that time period, and though Alexander doesn't overload the books with a lot of rather...well putrid facts concerning life at that time, he gives enough information to make a picture in the mind of a world very different from ours. <br />If readers have ever spent time in England, as I have, most know that the trip to Bath is a quick one for us. Yet Alexander brings up how grueling those trips were via stagecoach (or any type of coach). I think we forget how much we take for granted in being able to hop in a car and go somewhere in relative comfort and safety.<br />Alexander's best work are the characters he draws. I would be hesitant to accept a blind man as getting to a level in legal circles to wind up as a judge, except that I have an author-friend who wrote Silence of the Spheres about deaf people who managed to become scientists. Knowing that deafness was less acceptable then blindness, makes it more likely that the possibility exists for someone with visual impairments would make it. <br />Alexander's Sir Fielding is just a hair like Sherlock Holmes, only his blindness makes him more sensitive to sound and tactile sensations. This attribute helps him in his sleuthing endeavors...I totally understand this as blind friends have those same abilities, just as my vision and attention to visual details is more acute because I am deaf. This has been proven true for both blind and deaf persons in recent MRI scans by neuroscientists...so the author is not taking liberties with his character. His plots are less well developed, and as one reviewer said, the plots tends not to be the fast-paced one usually seen in modern mysteries. Time moved slower then, and the mores were different. So if you know your history, you should not expect the same type of behavior, language, etc. from people of that century as shown by those of this century.<br/>Fun book (well...for a mystery)...<BR>Karen Sadler<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-01-21

This was the first of Todd's books introducing readers to Rutledge and Hammish. I actually disagree with one of the previous reviewers that Hammish should 'leave'. Having family members who came back from WWI very scarred and subdued (from their letters and diaries), I can imagine that the British soldiers came back in even worse shape, than the Americans. We've only just started delving into the conditions known as post-traumatic stress disorder. Before the Vietnam War, this disorder was not recognized and treated as an illness. WWI veterans were referred to as being shell-shocked, but it wasn't just the noise from the constant bombardment. Most of these men were not even men yet, merely adolescents. They were exposed to trauma that we can only guess at: constant noise, mud, chemical warfare at its nastiest, dealing with daily fear and situations which would leave most of us very damaged. Yet when they came home, they were expected to 'buck up' and get over it, because society didn't understand what they had gone through.<br />Todd's history is much better then his mystery. I've read another of his further down the line, and enjoyed it very much. This first book tended to bog down, and there was not enough information to even expect the possibility of who the person responsible for the murder was. I was caught by surprise by the last couple of chapters, and it was not logical or sequential. <br />To be fair, this was a more than adequate first book. I am pleased to find another author who can write well, and since I expect that Todd will probably just get better as he continues writing these books (especially since I really enjoyed the last one I read)...I will continue to look for his material. If the reader enjoys an intelligent mystery, this is a good author to go to.<BR>Karen Sadler<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2002-01-03

I read some of the other reviewers, and tend to agree with what they say concerning this particular mystery by Barnes. I've read several others of hers, and enjoyed them. This genre is starting to wear a bit thin, I think. There are too many hard-core women sleuths, who have backgrounds as cops, and most of them seem to reside in different urban areas in the United States. That is the major difference between the books, and that is unfortunate. All these women who write books of this type are good at what they do, but they have been doing it for so long their writing skills have deteriorated, as they churn out mystery after mystery. This is in response to the large body of avid mystery readers out there who I assume do not vary their reading much. this is another part of the problem. If readers do not vary their reading into other genres, they cannot know what they are missing when an author gets sloppy in her characterizations or in her plots.<br />This is not to say this type of book cannot be done well, or that this particular book is not of value. Barnes seems to keep up with current problems in society, one of which is abuse of the elderly and the tendency for property within inner cities to be allowed to deteriorate and then bought up by those predators who will stop at nothing to make a few bucks (with the blessings of many politicians). The premise is good, but not drawn out to a point where the reader cannot tell you what is going to happen next. AS soon as the reader meets the old lady (who is a great curmudgeon), we know she is going to meet her end, and soon!<br />Unfortunately, this mystery was a bit too easy to solve. And Barnes tried to connect the series by throwing in improbable meetings with previous friends and lovers of the protagonist. At the risk of sounding nitpicking, I felt that the title was not very appropriate either. Just because fires were involved does not explain the use of the word &quot;Flashpoint&quot; (which is the point at whicha fire goes out of control, or a situation goes out of control as I understand it). Oh well...when I read a book of a series like this and I can see the author is no longer putting a lot of thought into her books or research effort, then I tend not to look for this particular author anymore. Don't want to waste my time.<br />Oh yeah, for those who care about such things, the language leaves a little to be desired!<BR>Karen Sadler,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2001-12-17

As other reviewers have said Reich's first novel is an obvious addition to the genre of medical examiner mysteries. Though the protagonist is an American, she lives and works in Canada, which is a nice change of pace. If anything, this novel is more grisly then most of the Kay Scarpetta stories. Probably has to do with the subject choice of serial murderers. If it weren't something you don't wish on any nation, I'd be relieved to see that other nations like Canada and England have problems with these guys (they are almost always guys) too. I wish someone could explain why our civilizations seem to breed these monstrosities of human beings. <br />Anyway, Reich does a good job for the first time out. The reason for the four stars is the grisly subject matter. Anyone with a propensity for nightmares or who enjoys lighter fare, should steer clear of this book...but it is an intelligent addition to the genre. I have a few problems with anyone butting into police business so willy-nilly with little regard for the rules. I could understand it if family or friends were involved, but I feel this is less reality and more personal desire to wield more individual control over cases which deeply involve and horrify us. <br />Karen Sadler,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2001-12-04

This ultimately led to major discoveries about how cancer works, as well as other necessary biochemical information that is now taught on a daily basis to medical research students in neuroscience and other fields. <br />Folkman is one of those people who are in science and medicine for the benefits of others, as well as because he enjoys what he does. These are the types of people who ultimately do the most good. They quietly persist in their endeavors, and let their work tell the story. Too many times, scientists allow their questions and the answers to those questions to be influenced by the egos of their peers, the quest for fame and money (especially in biotechnology and genetics), and by fear of ridicule. It is unfortunate that so much science is done in labs throughout the world in such a way as to crush those who have unique ideas and can add creativity to the scientific endeavor. <br />Folkman obviously made his lab a wonderful place to work in. To do that and be a good teacher, as well as an excellent researcher (who cares if he is a surgeon...it's the questions that are asked and researched that are important, not who does the asking). Those who were able to work with him and in his lab had valuable experiences, that happens all too rarely in the labs in this country. I was lucky in that I got mentors who were neuropathologists who dealt with both patients and research, and they were great teachers.<br />Cooke is a wonderful writer. I intend to look for his other books because he did such a wonderful job with a topic which could have been boring. He explained the science behind angiogenesis in such a way so everyone can understand it. He also described the not-so-nice and competitive world of research science...nailed all the personalities involved! I had to laugh at much of this because I totally understood about the biased peer review and the political games which go on in this world. <br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education	2001-11-29

In reading one of Barr's more current mysteries, I discovered I had somehow bypassed this particular one. I thoroughly enjoy Barr's books, not only for the good mystery readers can expect, but because of the environs that she places the mysteries in. Barr uses the great National Parks for her scenarios, and inevitably she ends up teaching readers about areas in the United States we are not familiar with. This time the story revolved around the Carlsbad Cavern area. I have never read anything on cave climbing or spelunking, though since my husband is a scoutmaster I am familiar with the boys doing this type of stuff. I was fascinated by the descriptions of the caves, as well as the absolute darkness and disorientation that people undergo when in this type of situation. <br />I can guarantee, that as well written as Barr's work in this novel are, you will not catch me putting myself into this situation. It all sounds too claustrophobic and confining for me, besides the fact that deaf people often have balance problems and this would not make for good climbers. Yikes! <br />I gave this book a five because it was so well-written and I enjoyed it so much. However, it may be too technical in its jargon for some fans of lighter mystery reading. I am also impressed with the need to practice good environmental protection of these precious resources, and the storyline was very plausible about some people putting corporate greed above the need to protect these places. It's been done before, it is happening now, and will happen in the future. Barr does a good job painting pictures of these caves and resources and explaining why they need protection. <BR>Karen Sadler,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2001-11-29

I've picked up Hart's mysteries before and enjoyed them for what they are worth...very light mysteries, with unsubstantial plots and not very 'deeply-drawn' characters. This one was probably the least enjoyable I've read, and since I like my books a little more realistic and with more substance and good writing, I doubt I will be back to this particular author.<br />Hart means well, and I know she has a big following. But as another reviewer has mentioned, Hart really expects the reader to swallow a very poorly written and poorly plotted reason for the female protagonist's father for being missing in her life, and then gives an improbable reason for him showing up again, along with a step-sister she didn't know existed? Not only that but she had this sister apparently living on the island too? And when she sees the girl, she recognizes familial facial features?<BR>This island is a place where most people know each other except during tourist season, yet there seems to be a young doppelganger on the island with features similar to Annie's?<BR>Sorry, doesn't make sense to me...<br />I had no problems figuring out who the probable suspect was, since there were too many obvious suspects, and I took a violent dislike to the character immediately. A mystery is a good one for me that retains a little of the 'mystery' until the very end! Once again, I felt that this was a case of an author getting too familiar with her characters, too comfortable with her audience, and she just rattled off the book as fast as possible.<br />I am sure my review won't discourage those who are enamored of this type of light reading. Not enough literary skill or 'meat' for my taste.<BR>Karen Sadler,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2001-10-29

I found this fascinating reading, partially because Douglas gives us an edited view into a world most of us are interested in, but really don't want to be immersed in. He has admitted before that his job took a familial and health toll on him, and most of us recognize that we would even be less prepared for what this 'world' requires of those who work in it.<br />The stories/cases are especially interesting because of the insight which Douglas can give. I thought the histories of the Ripper and Borden cases were especially good. I had no idea of the historical and social context of the area in London where the Ripper resided, and the lack of forensic evidence does not seem to interfere much with the common sense with which Douglas proposes specific possible suspects. <br />As others have said, all I read on the Jon Benet murder was from the slanted information given through the media. Plus as a mother, I was horrified by the dressing up of this little girl to look like someone older than she was. Douglas provides a different point of view with validity, that I don't see being portrayed in the media. We definitely should not be trying people though the media...we cannot possibly know all the facts, especially when others involved (including the police, the FBI, friends of the family, etc.) all provide divergent views. I am not sure what I believe at this point, but I think I will reserve judgement in most cases from now on and also curtail my exposure to the news media's take on cases like this...<br />As usual, Douglas and company write a good, and intelligent book for readers. I get a huge kick out of his snide remarks...he tends to write as he thinks and as he talks, which makes it more accessible.<BR>Karen Sadler,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2001-10-15

There are not enough words or good enough words to describe this book, or the person who wrote this book. I have been aware of the presence of Temple Grandin for some years now. I have read about her in Oliver Sack's books. I have seen journalistic shows concerning her on television. I have known that she is considered autistic (been diagnosed as that)and that she had a Ph.D. and works with animals, primarily livestock. All of this information predisposed me to be interested in her life, and ready to admire her for everything that she has accomplished.<br />However, it was not until my own nephew was diagnosed as having a developmental delay problem of his own, Asperger's, that I actually sought out more information about Temple Grandin and autism. In studying neuroscience, we just barely scratched the surface of this disability, and I remember thinking that this was an area of great dissent and of great need. Above all, there is an obvious need to hear from those who have autism. There are many books out there by parents, by physicians and scientists, by educators and psychiatrists. But there are few books by those who live the life of someone with autism. As a deaf person I know that those who would understand what it is like to be deaf in a hearing world cannot possibly imagine the problems, the obstacles, and even the joys which come with my differences. So I am also aware that I cannot understand other disabilities and differences unless they are told to me by someone who has actually been through it themselves.<br />Grandin does a great service to those with autism and those who have loved ones with autism or developmental delay disabilities. By allowing us access into her world, and explaining why she 'behaved' certain ways in certain circumstances, it allows others to comprehend the absolutely mind-boggling over-stimulation that these persons are exposed to. Not only does it aid in understanding and allow us to reserve judgement (rather than condemning these children as uncontrollable), it may help those who are exploring the neuroscience accounting for autism as well as lead to the development of educational and behavioral methodologies which can assist these children to meet their potentials and fulfill their lives. It also helps all of us to realize that differences do not necessarily have to be negative.<br />Temple Grandin and her mother are examples of what can be accomplished through love and education. Grandin was helped on her path by her mother and good teachers, but she also helped herself by educating herself on all possible fronts as to why she reacted and behaved (and how to control those reactions and behaviors). I can only begin to imagine the difficulties that both she and her mother faced in overcoming her problems, and making the most of her abilities. This book is necessary reading for all parents of children with these disabilities, for those who work with them in education and in psychiatry. I have now added Ms. Grandin to my list of people I admire, up there with Lincoln, Helen Keller, and Albert Schweitzer. She is an inspiration to us all of what can be done with hard work and perseverance. As she stated &quot;Children, including the autistics, are not static&quot;...all children and all people can always be taught and can achieve more. It is only the prejudices of others that are allowed to dictate what any child can or cannot accomplish.<br />Karen Sadler,<br />Science Education,<br />University of Pittsburghe children as uncontrollable), it may help those who are exploring the neuroscience accounting for autism as well as lead to the development of educational and behavioral methodologies which can assist these children to meet their potentials and fulfill their lives.

I love it when I pick up a book by a new author who I have not read before, and find that the author is capable in character and plot development. Ellis is a good writer at both of these particulars, not great, but definitely so good at what she does that her mysteries deserve a five star rating. For those readers who enjoy intelligent mysteries, her books will be a nice addition. Her Wesley Peterson, a black detective, seems to be an intelligent fellow with a different background in archaeology. This background comes of some use (and brings him in contact with hilarious 'tree-huggers' and friends from universities with agendas of their own) in a mystery involving two women separated by centuries who are hung for crimes they didn't commit. Nice to see we Americans are not the only ones who lynched first, and asked questions (or not!) later.<br />Ellis' characters are definitely characters. I love Wesley's boss, a lonely widower who is looking for friends. Part of the ability to draw realistic characters is the ability to observe real human beings and their reactions to normal life, which includes loved ones dying from cancer and the subsequent need of those left behind to find something to do with themselves besides work. If the reader can sympathize with the character, then the author has done a good job.<br />As always, I enjoy reading British writers and really enjoy reading mysteries with a historical bent. I had no idea about the existence of art called &quot;Jesse Trees&quot; which are an artistic rendering of the geneaology of Jesus. I am so intrigued by this I plan to look up some more information on these 'trees'...<BR>Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2001-09-24

I usually do not get self-help books, but since finding out for the second time in twenty years that I have full blown IC and being told to read some books on this...well, if I have to do it, this is an excellent book for reference. It is hard to find physicians that are willing to treat their women patients and the female public at large as if we have half a brain. This doctor writes clearly and concisely, but he doesn't 'dummy' down the topic, nor does he patronize the women who are going to be the major group purchasing this book.<br />The last time I was diagnosed with IC was in 1983. Apparently things have changed significantly in this field since then. When I was first diagnosed I was only 24 or so, and it was hell trying to get anyone to recognize I had a 'real' problem which was not female related, nor was it 'all in my head'. My husband and I were frantic to find a solution, and at that time they did not understand what was causing this nor basic treatments for it, though they were experimenting with DMSO which eventually solved the problem for several years. The tendency for many doctors to dismiss my pain and agony of this condition as being 'mental' was the first step on my path to med school and neuroscience in spite of my deafness.<br />This book provides all the current information that a patient needs to know. I actually read the book in an evening, it was that clear. Since knowing what doctors usually write like in medical journal Moldwin deserves praise for writing such an understandable and intelligent book! I am beginning to realize that this condition is obviously something which plagues a lot of women (and to be fair, some men). I also am pleased to note that finally it is being taken seriously by physicians, and that most likely, this is something I will have to spend my life dealing with.<br />It certainly makes it easier to deal with it (and knowing I will have to have outpatient procedures) when I know the doctors take it seriously. I've already implemented some of this doctor's recommendations and find they are helping somewhat. I highly recommend this book to anyone going through this, and I also recommend contacting a support group (I cannot since I am deaf) which will help deal with the emotional and mental fallout from this condition.<br />Karen Sadler,<br />Science Education,<br />University of Pittsburghready implemented some of this doctor's recommendations and find they are helping somewhat.

First off, I didn't know Elizabeth George was an American writing about the English. Previous exposure to authors writing about other nations makes me a little bit nervous. I sure hope she knows what she is talking about. From her background material it looks like she talks to the right people to get information. In this case, the information needed to be about racial problems in Britain. As Americans, we often think that we are the only ones with the big problems between the races and with civil rights...but unfortunately this is a problem throughout the world. Prejudice is obviously something that all nations have to deal with. The only thing that changes is who is being discriminated against and why.<br />George writes very complex stories. Her characters are never simple, the plot is never straightforward. I don't think I have ever picked up one of her books and known before her ending who the actual 'culprit' was, and I am always wrong about what the true situation is. <br />This time her female protagonist, who for a change is more like us normal people (rather than the athletic women we see in American mysteries/PIs) is dealing with the aftermath of a brutal attack and her being 'put out to pasture.' She becomes involved in a neighbor's problem because of her concern for a child, and this problem involves what appears to be a racially-motivated killing of a Pakistanian man in another town. Barbara just happens to know the investigator in charge in this case, and respects her from a previous encounter. Wishing to be of help to all concerned, she involves herself into a situation without fully disclosing her previous knowledge of her neighbor or her own concernes and biases. <br />Like many of us in the real world, Barbara relunctantly comes to understand that her former mentor (another woman) may be a good cop, but she also has feet of clay. The investigation revolves around race, not just because it looks like a race-based crime, but because the primary investigator has racial prejudices herself and brings those prejudices to her work. This happens all too often in the real world, in all fields of work. <br />George is an excellent writer. My only complaint is again, the language used tends to be more colorful then I would like it. I know I am deaf, but surely people do not speak like that constantly. I am being naive, I guess...but maybe we need to put ratings on books to indicate language, violence, and sex for those who prefer not to be exposed to this stuff all the time? Just a suggestion! <BR>Karen Sadler,<BR>University of Pittsburgh	2001-09-04

I tend to read what other reviewers say especially when their opinions differ from my own, and I want to know why. When I went to get something 'good' to read (usually means a mystery to get my mind off of my daily grind), Cornwell's book was on the number 1 reading list for almost all of the major media. Since most of the reviews written on Amazon.com are predominantly negative...this presents a conundrum. Are the reviewers wrong or are all the people who are purchasing and reading this book wrong?<BR>Granted, Cornwell's protagonist has been getting 'stale'. As is typical with long-running series the author seems to be having problems with making her plots and characters diverse enough to please everyone. After her last book in this series, I wasn't sure I was going to read her again. But I figured all those people buying this very thick addition to her series couldn't all be wrong. I was pleasantly surprised to see that I was right. Cornwell seems to have gotten a second 'literary wind' and the book makes for good reading. A lot of loose ends are tied up in this chapter of Scarpetta's life, with the truth about Benton's death finally coming to some type of conclusion. I have yet to read a mystery series where at some point, both the author and the protagonist runs out of 'gas', and where the stories do not seem to be familiar or lack the excitement of the first few books in the series. Even Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes had major problems at the end...Doyle tried without much luck to get rid of his alter ego/protagonist, but ended up having to ressurect him because of the outcry. The same thing happened when Cornwell tried writing a book considerably different from her usual. Readers and critics cannot have it both ways, and perhaps they should cut Cornwell some slack?<BR>Cornwell still has brought the genre one of its best and most interesting protagonists. Her writing and the intelligence of her plots are still way above par, and she deserves recognition for teaching the public about a field of expertise that was not well-developed prior to Scarpetta's entrance on the scene (forensic science). ....	2001-08-30

I thought it would be a series of stories about children being kind. It actually ended up as a free-flowing continuous stream-of-consciousness tale on the part of the author. It was partly on the children, and partly on the reaction of the author and other teachers towards the small kindnesses that children give to one another in diverse situations. Even though Paley tells us about the interesting story-telling learning which she instigates, the story-telling is less important to the book then the kindnesses of the children. The story-telling is the means by which the kindnesses continue, a means to acknowledge that kindness has occurred, and that children are responsible for solitary  acts that can have  ripple-like effects.<br />What I find incredibly interesting and wish that Paley had dealt with is that this behavior of small children  prior to the fourth grade seems to be 'taught' out of children, by the adults in their lives. I may be wrong about this, but the national problems with bullying seem to occur right after third grade (which most educators and parents know is a major transitional point). Where is it that we are teaching our children not to be kind to others?<br />This book is sweet and extremely interesting. Paley brings up the possibility of an intelligence based not on intellect, but on an inner sense of being able to 'see' when another person is hurting. I would have liked more information...this book raises more questions then it provides the solutions for....	2001-08-20

What do you do with a book that in spite of disagree with the vantage point of the author, you have to admit that the points he raises and the stand he takes has some validity? That an author can cause the reader to stop and think about firmly held belief systems, is indicative of a good writer in my opinion. <br />The author of this bioethical treatise is not a physician. He is a sociologist, and he is giving the historical background to the immense changes in how the American public views its medical establishment. In the process of becoming involved in ethics in the medical world, Rothman had to come in close contact with those he was writing about...physicians. I get the feeling that he was and to a point still in awe of the great men and the great minds he has been exposed to. Occasionally, the book seemed to be biased in favor of the physicians. A book such as this cannot be written without showing the author's own biases; author's can only admit that they harbor particular biases towards those they are writing about. <br />In many issues Rothman comes down solidly on behalf of the physicians, whether or not they brought about the changes in the public's attitudes towards those who work in medicine. Rothman bemoans the fact that the public has involved lawyers, bioethicists, and politicians in what used to be the private domain of physicians. Yet he writes and explains the history behind this lowering of pedestals for doctors and medical researchers...all the while trying to explain why physicians felt their patients should rely 'on those who know and understand' (read that to mean physicians think most patients and families are too stupid to understand basic concepts). <br />This book actually gives a good and vitally important background into the movements for individual rights and the exposure of unethical experimentation and medical treatment which led to the creation of new standards for medical care and research, as well as the installment of Internal Research Boards (IRBs) which are suppose to act as brakes on over-ambitious and unethical practices. Unfortunately, it is all too clear in recent media reports that even IRBs in universities and hospitals are not enough to  protect the American public from research by those not interested in protecting the patients and alleviating pain, but rather shows more concern for keeping the grant money coming, fame, and doing science merely for the sake of doing science ('because we can!) John Hopkins obviously hasn't changed its attitudes over 30 some odd years towards the rights of the individual, since they are continuing to attract attention and controversy because of unethical research. <br />This book is definitely a must-read for anyone interested in bioethics. Even if the reader does not agree with the author, the book provides a different, and somewhat valid reflection of the medical establishment's views towards the infringement of their previously existing rights in determining patient care and the moral standards of research.

The first book, The Golden Compass, was a little bit plodding...but now that I read the second part of this fantasy/sci fi series, it makes considerably more sense. I am sure those readers who read more of this particular genre may be more prepared for what Pullman was trying to do in the first book. This book practically whizzed by at nonstop pace for me. So much became clearer that I did not appreciate in the first book. I kind of like that ability to distract the reader in one book, only to fully develop characters and plot information in the next book in such a manner as to totally involve the reader. This is a rare ability in any writer, but Pullman obviously has great talent in this area.<br />Again, though these books may be intended for both an adolescent and adult audience...some of the writing is over my head occasionally and I have 2 degrees in Neuroscience (one from medical school). As the mother of 2 adults and 1 adolescent, I think my children in their twenties could appreciate the very carefully woven stories of multiple worlds, theology, and science, whereas the adolescents which I usually come in contact with through teaching and my current puberty-laden challenge might find the series tough going. This is one of those books and series that parents should read first...after all we are supposed to be involved and interested in our teenager's lives (that includes  knowing what they are reading, watching, and listening too--at least for hearing people!)<br />The exquisite formation of characters of different worlds and species (both human and spectral), and theories/reasoning involving such complex subjects like mental illness, man's inhumanity to both children and animals, and the possibility of other worlds besides our own by Pullman is probably the best thing he does. The books may be viewed as pure entertainment (and good entertainment at that), but the concepts he delves into raise interestingquestions for those who think about it more deeply. <br />These are great summer books for taking to the beach and getting away from the usual everyday world, but I can also see curling up on a fall morning when the rain is coming down and losing myself in this myth. I can also see reading (or signing) chapters to older students, and discussing why and how Pullman makes this story come together and work at capturing our imaginations with a combination of fantasy and science (once more proving that science does not have to mean dull repitition or rote-learning!)

Those who lambasted the scientific idiots running the eugenics movement as being prejudiced and biased in their science, lauded this book as one of the most complete of all recent books written on this topic. Those who support the motives behind eugenics, fixed upon this particular book and author as the one they needed to tear apart. That gives readers an idea of how accurately Kelves pushed the buttons of those who would practice eugenics, euthanasia, doctor-assisted suicide, and other such controversial practices. Kelves research job is outstanding, and even though the reader can tell the opinion of Kevles from the way he writes, he certainly more than backed up his writing with pertinent references and cross-references. <br />In fact, I enjoyed reading his references and bibliography, because it was just loaded with information that he chose not to use in the text of his book. I also tend to go searching through his index and references for extra information because of all of the books I've read on eugenics here in the U.S. his is the most valid and inclusive of everything I've seen so far. This is a topic which is very difficult to read, let alone write about, without developing very strong opinions not only of the movement itself, but of the people involved one way or another in this particular stain on American history. See...I cannot even keep my own mouth shut for writing a short review on a book on the topic...I cannot imagine researching it for a period of years and being expected to remain distant and objective about it. Kevles does a relatively good job presenting the facts and not becoming too strident about the questionable scientific practices which flourished in order to 'prove' preconceived ideas and beliefs. The book is extremely readable (especially compared to most textbooks for sociology or ethics),and I can understand why professors would recommend this book to their students rather than reading a dry textbook. I certainly have no plans to get rid of my copy, and I will be lending it out and recommending it to those I teach concerning the disabled and bioethics. ...	2001-07-15

It is a rare thing to come across fantasy which is anything close to that written by Tolkien, L'Engle, and The Chronicles of Narnia. This book and series does not quite make the cut, language-wise, but the fantasy (and actually there is a mix of sci-fi in here) gets increasingly interesting as the book goes on. The last half of the book by Pullman was not only captivating but the ideas which permeate the story are intriguing in and of themselves.<br />Like many of the authors and books I mentioned, I get the feeling this book may have started out as a book for young readers. Somewhere along the line of writing it, I think by necessity it is actually more suitable for adults. I remember Tolkien's stories having wars and deaths, but this book (like most other media today) has a lot of violence in it, and I would recommend it only to very mature and stable adolescents. Not only that but to a Christian, some of the story's interpretations of the Bible and the discussion of what seems to be an organized Church gone bad may be a bit too much for parents of children and adolescents. So even though I plan to recommend this to my 16 year old to read, because I feel she will not only find it interesting but because of her maturity, I don't think I would automatically recommend it to all youth that I teach (hearing or deaf).<br />This is not to say this isn't the beginning of a great series and a great author of fantasy. Some of the book was actually quite shocking...but I found the thought of every human having a companion/daemon who changed shapes according to the emotional needs of its human really a great and unique concept. As a lonely deaf child, I would have absolutely loved to have that type of companion and so it is really interesting that another person obviously thought that up too. I pretended for many years that I had a missing twin who was deaf like me somewhere...it is amazing the things children will invent to survive.<br />Pullman is a good writer of the English language. This is important. I've rarely come across fiction, fantasy, science fiction that is written as well as more serious work...and Pullman and The Gold Compass comes closer then most current works of any type. It is with great interest that I look forward to reading the other books of this series. Karen SAdler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2001-07-13

This first novel of Hockenberry is promoted as a thriller or a mystery. I think both of those designations do not do justice to this book. This book demands that the reader think, and it is hardly light and banal reading. As another reviewer has stated, the author uses 'stream of conciousness' which was very difficult for me to understand at first. There are so many characters involved with such different backgrounds, values, and belief systems...that at first it was extremely difficult to follow. However, this is one of those books that the reader must stick with and ultimately not only is it worth it, but after closing the book when finished, the mind is racing and wondering &quot;Is this a real possibility?&quot;<br />Hockenberry has the background as a journalist to acquire information about subjects that many writers do not have the ability to do. He takes full advantage of this to weave a story with a basis in reality that is shocking in its telling. Like most people, I know a little bit about all the topics he raises: the rights of Native Americans, our historical past concerning nuclear arms and nuclear energy, the prejudices that exists against people and their beliefs, the all too real tendency of corporations and government to discard their loyal workers after years of grueling and thankless work, and the environmental impact of our country's energy needs. This book greatly expanded my understanding of many of these topics, and piqued my interest in both the Northwest and the Native Americans from that area (I immediately went to the web to look up the dams on the Columbia River). To me this is a sign of a great book and a good writer. When people are moved to find out more about subject matters because the author has made it so interesting, then the author has more then succeeded. <br />I hope that Hockenberry continues to write, and continues to provide us with books that make us stop and think. Definitely worth the time and the money... Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2001-07-07

For readers who like their mysteries to have some basis in fact and preferably a foot in reality, this is a series with definite promise. Scientists are not as free from emotions and prejudices as the general public has been led to believe, and Aaron Elkins plays on this knowledge with terrific results. This was the first time I had picked up a mystery with the Professor Gideon Oliver in it. Since I love forensics and enjoy archaeology when it is well-written about, this book was loads of fun. The author gives plenty of background to the story plot; he makes sure that the fictional web he weaves has enough information for the general reader to understand the science behind the mystery without wasting a lot of words or time. I was fascinated by the descriptions of the 'abris', the information on how 'fakes' are made to look old, and the knowledge about the arguments in the anthropological sciences. Actually the basis of the whole story lies in professional jealousy, which is not far-fetched at all (I saw too many scientists who wanted to prove their theories at any cost, and have read about more!). <br />I have never been to France so I have to take Elkin's word for his descriptions of this area of the world. His detailed account of both the countryside, and the anthropological discoveries makes for outstanding color and background for the mystery plot. I got a kick out of his narration of the little towns in this area of France who are proud of their place in science, and the picture he drew of all the townspeople going to listen to lectures on the anthropology discoveries in their area. How nice it would be if Americans would put as much interest into science and their own histories!<br />As other reviewers have said, the story line was a tad slow, but well worth the wait. It is nice to find another intelligent mystery writer. His writing is better than good, his descriptions are wonderful, characterization is pretty good, and his plot lineand the science involved are fantastic. This is a definite 'must-read' addition to my list of authors. Karen SAdler, Science Education, University of PIttsburgh	2001-06-27

In looking into the history of science education and what changes need to be made in science education in public schools in order for them to meet the needs of diverse students and do an effective job in teaching science, I went looking for anything and everything I could find at the library at the University of Pittsburgh. This book is written I guess for those who are developing programs in science. But once again, I see people writing not to an audience to eludidate and enliven their science programs, but rather to people who write these kinds of books. It is like scientists who write to journals to impress other scientists, not add to the body of science for everyone's benefit. I tried several times to 'get interested' in this book, and I couldn't. The format was dry and unhelpful...big deal, they can use bullets, so can computer lectures! I certainly would not recommend anyone waste money on this for individual classroom or teacher use, and probably the lowest it will go are people doing educational research like me. Teachers do not have the time to waste on this stuff, nor do school administrators... Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2001-06-20

I am two generations away from WWII, but my grandfather served in the Navy. He never said much about his service, and I was too young to ask. But I've always wondered in my advanced placement history class in highschool, and as I've continued to take classes in history in college. Lately, my research into The Medical Holocaust and of course, the movies on WWII and the clamor over the monument, have piqued my interest in this subject area. I've always believed that the truth is stranger then fiction...in the case of this book, the heroics of the American and Phillipino men and women far surpasses any heroics rendered by fictional characters. Sides does an incredible job of research into this story. It reads like an old John Wayne movie, and it is too bad he isn't around anymore, because this story is right up his alley. I have nothing but admiration for these men on both sides...the Rangers who risked so much and the guerrillas who helped them, and the men who survived the horror of a Japanese prison camp. We cannot possibly understand everything they went through, but Hampton Sides gives us an opportunity in this great book, to share in their riveting tale of courage and survival. This is the consummate war story. It takes your breath away. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2001-06-20

This book was a surprise to me...I thought it was merely a mystery from all the reviews I had read, and even from the cover of the book itself. Yet the mystery turned out not to be as compelling as the historical story and the story of dual obsessions. The intelligent narration of the story within a story proved to be confusing sometimes, yet overall the writing was spectacular. This young author has a definite way with words and descriptions of the possible discovery of Australia by the Portuguese proved to be one of the most compelling historical fiction I have read in years. The research and incorporation of the cartographic science involved, and also the tale of scientific obsession which leads to jealousy, bitterness, and rivalry is all too credible. I personally am not crazy about the use of objectional language, especially if it serves no purpose to move the story along (which I felt was the case here). However, Bradley's impressive language use and insights into the links between the past, present, and future made for an exquisite book. <br />This book is a definite must for readers who enjoy mysteries with plausible historical context and for those who enjoy writers who are masterful practitioners of the English language.

It is hard for me to give less than a five to one of Penny Warner's mysteries because I want so badly to be able to encourage and cheer on her deaf protagonist, Connor. This is an fun read, an entertaining read, and it teaches those who are nondisabled much about the deaf and hard-of-hearing world. This particular novel with its give-away title is also teaching about those who have sight disabilities. While I applaud Ms. Warner's determination to teach about deafness and other differences, sometimes the plot of the mystery and the characterization ends up taking a back seat to the details with which Warner almost floods the book about American Sign Language, about reading lips or trying to make sense of partial sentences, and in this book, how diabetes can cause blindness and the development of other senses in the face of loss of hearing or sight. <br />Having said that, most people will find this book intriguing and certainly I found the use of Mark Twain's story about the frog jumping entertainment of that area of California to be great fun. I also enjoy Connor's snide and irreverent attitude toward 'stupid hearing people' such as the mayor, and her coming to terms with her own deafness and the occasional social problems it brings (yes, there is a sign for 'stupid hearing people' but it may be different in California!) I have read other books of Warner's and enjoyed them more...I think she put just a bit too much information in here about disabilities when she should have fleshed out the other characters more, such as Miah who was introduced as the major suspect and then he totally disappeared until the end of the book with no explanation.<br />I will continue to look for and read Ms. Warner's books. For the most part they are fun mysteries and I certainly appreciate the education that she provides to those who have no disabilities about those of us who do have them. She continues to break the stereotypes for us, but next time...more mystery, and less preaching please! Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2001-06-13
1964019:US	53067930	RNSRKI946V87C	0028604032	375525894	The New York Public Library Science Desk Reference	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Handy reference book for educational purposes.	Anyone who is in the sciences, especially the biological sciences, know that the information being discovered it growing at an exponential rate. This makes it incredibly difficult to write a textbook for science, since one way or another, you are going to miss recent knowledge which may not be widely available yet. It is also difficult to decide what science is important to learn. This is one of the major problems in developing science educational standards that all students between K-12th grade should be expected to learn. I am inclined to think that purchasing references books such as this fine example, would almost be preferable to buying textbooks that will be out of date within six months. A reference manual such as this is not intended to be used for reading straight through to gain information on one particular science. Rather it acts as a basic foundation from which to springboard science knowledge. The concept of recommending current reference books, distributing science journal papers and using the vast amount of science knowledge now available on the web is an idea that has been used at the college level for several years. It is now a good idea to extend this practice to the junior high and high school level, rather than attempting to cram textbooks full of scientific information which may or may not be valid and useful to students by the time they complete the class. <br />My main objections to this reference book are two. First, for most deaf students (and for nondisabled students too) reseach has demonstrated that the more visual information given in terms of pictures, graphics, photographs, mathematical equations, etc., the more likely students will remember science. This book could definitely use more pictures and graphics, and it could definitely use color for enhancing learning. This particular reference would be great for on-line, especially if the New York Public Library was willing (or Macmillan) to keep it up-to-date...pictures, graphics, and photographs could easily be scanned to make the information more potent to the learner. The other objection is the placement of a large field of study, Neuroscience, in the biology section and it is given barely a nod, when it is as vital to our understanding as genetics is. Even though Neuroscience is considered to be a rather new field, its impact on medicine and behavioral sciences is too large to be dismissed. Perhaps the publishers will rectify this error the next time around.<br />Otherwise, I find this to be an excellent resource, both for me and for those I teach.

This particular addition to Barr's collection of mysteries is not on par with her usual concise and interesting stories. Barr has one of the most unique inputs into the mystery genre--with a protagonist who has a job that many of us nature lovers would give eyeteeth for if we did not have families and previous commitments that we cannot abandon. I purposely pick up Barr's books because they give me an insight into her day job, and into the national parks I may never get an opportunity to explore.<br />This book is not as well done as her others. I felt as if she were floundering through the entire book until the last couple of chapters. The ending is extremely satisfying and the explanation for the presence of a larger than normal grizzly in the lower 48 was along the lines of what I was thinking even at the very beginning of the book. However, novels should not just a means to the end, literally, and the journey to the ending should be just as understandable and intriguing as the ending itself. Usually Barr can deliver, but this book failed in this journey. I usually force myself to finish the books (unless the book lacks any worth at all), and in this case I was glad I did because of the great ending. Since every writer should be allowed to fall short once in a while, I will excuse the written shambles in this book and continue to read Barr's works. Her many other mysteries have consistently been good stories, so perhaps her muse took a leave of absence for this one! :-) Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2001-06-02

I am torn with this book. If rating a book is based merely upon delivery of information, on correct grammar and no typographical errors by the author or the publisher, or on other mundane things that go into the making of a great book, then this book may have deserved a four star ranking or less. But if a book's rating is on the importance of the information within its covers to the world at large, then this book deserves higher then a five star rating! So I guess it evens out to the five star no matter how it is given. <br />Since I had read Garrett's previous book on emerging diseases and found it fascinating, I was interested to see she had brought out a book on public health. This is an immense book, and yet she barely scratched the surface of this problem. However, she does choose the most prominent problems in public health, in my opinion. She tackles the fact that our world has grown significantly smaller and at more risk for emerging diseases from other countries with the ease of travel. Garrett also deals with the dismantling of the Soviet Union's government and health infrastructure, and she does it well but delving into the problems that existed prior to the collapse of Communism. Then she tackles the health care crisis in the United States, which has major problems of its own (and is quick to ignore!). She also writes about biowarfare and the tie in between the collapse of the Soviet Union and our own public health problems which will ultimately determine the fate of the world. <br />In spite of being such a large book dealing with a heavy topic, the writing is relatively concise and readable. It must have been a heck of a job to not only write, but rewrite, and narrow down the topics of this book without diluting the importance of public health throughout the world. Very few writers could have pulled off this book as well as Garrett did. Part of that is due to her being a journalist, and not a scientist. <br />This book is scary...well-written nonfiction dealing with such serious topics as public health are always much scarier then books that Stephen King could dream up. It is horrifying to realize how close we are to the precipice, and how ambivalent most people and governments are to the well-being of the world. Most people are unwilling to face the fact that our individual health is intertwined with the health of all...I wish someone would insist that President Bush read this book prior to dismantling more of the health, food, and water standards, and perhaps explain it to him, that ultimately we will pay for neglect of our water and environment, the ignorance and corruption in the food industry, and the lack of basic medical care for the children of America.

Reality is often more compelling then fiction. Especially in this case, does this maxim turn out to be true. The book and movie, Jaws, did not hold the fascination that it seem to hold for the rest of America. Even as a teenager, I thought the whole thing was too fake, too contrived and I did not understand what the uproar was about. Over the years, the mental influence of being a mother and the knowledge coming out of research by NOVA, National Geographic, and other scientific groups made me wary of the beach. This book is definitely NOT going to help!<br />I don't understand why all of the sudden we are experiencing a spate of great non-fiction writers: I am just grateful for its occurrence. Mike Capuzzo definitely belongs in this category. Again, this topic would have been very easy to sensationalize (obviously the yellow journalism of 1916 had a field day with this topic), but Capuzzo practices great restraint and even greater writing skills in this account of a natural catastrophe which impacted the psyche of the nation. The reality of the rogue shark and its venture into populated areas is so chilling, it is almost beyond belief that this shark made its way up a creek along the Jersey beach line that should have been a safe haven for the young men and boys who frequented its cool water. <br />What I found even more compelling is the probable science behind the shark's behavior. For once, we humans were completely unresponsible for this tragedy. Our pollution from human sewage may have attracted this monster, but the change in climate and patterns of the currents were under no one's control. Capuzzo does an excellent job tying in current knowledge and beliefs concerning shark behavior (and the behavior of other animals which change into 'man-eaters') without damaging the classic story-telling ability of this book. The science merely adds to the compelling history. Capuzzo is very capable in not anthromorphizing the shark's behavior, but does offer explanationsas to why it altered its usual feeding habits and started stalking humans.<br />The frenzy of the populations of the small towns along the creek which experienced the worse of the carnage is understandable. The courage of those who sought to protect the children, and the men who finally captured this creature makes for good reading almost a century after the fact. A terrific story by a wonderful writer.

This book was not recommended, was not widely read, but had been listed as a reference in another book  in my readings about the historical context of the medical holocaust which happened here in the United States prior to Nazi Germany's excursion into hell. The title and slight mention given in a bibliography made me stop what I was doing and head for Amazon.com to find out what the book was about. The slight blurb was enough to pique my interest and I sent for the book.<br />This book is one of the most unique stories I have read in the onslaught of material on the eugenicists and their prejudicial science. Pernick is a historical biographer of medical practicioners and of the early films produced promoting eugenic ideals. During the early 1900's an American physician, Haiselden, very publicly 'allowed' a new-born infant with disabilities to die through withholding food, water, and surgical treatment. This occurrence was not an unusual one for physicians in general. Infanticide had occurred on one level or another, by physicians, midwives, and parents for years especially when infants were disabled and the families were poor. The difference lay in how this particular physican handled the media attention he received. This man courted the media to promote his views on physician assisted killing when children were born with disabilities or deformities. He went even farther and 'starred' in a film which   portrayed the situation and the accompanying ethics as held by eugenicists and those who proposed euthanasia for the unwanted in the United States. <br />The history of early film-making coincides with the major years of influence of American eugenicists. This is history which has been forgotten, which is not on display at the Smithsonian museum, and is only mentioned by the Eugenics ARchive at Cold Spring Harbor. This book is of deep historical importance, and the author does awonderful job of tying in the influence of the media and science on social movements. Pernick does an outstanding job of presenting the facts involved with as little emotional or critical writing, so the reader are free to develop their own opinions. The research and the restoration of these films (still pictures from the film are included) to the American public is a phenomenol job and this book should be on the list of recommendations for those in biomedical ethics, in medical care, disability rights activists, and film enthusiasts. It is only by remembering this history, and American participation in it, that we can even hope to avoid this from happening again, especially with the completion of the Human Genome Project and the push for physician assisted suicide, as well as the promotion of utilitarian ethics in a world of scarce medical resources...	2001-05-13

He does everything well...his characters are three dimensional and interesting people, his plots are some of the best in the business, his writing  is superb and makes the reader think, and his descriptions of the south and the area in which the mystery takes place makes it possible to conjure up a picture in the imagination. Very few authors have all these abilities, and especially in the mystery genre where many good authors tend to crank out the books without putting much thought into them. It is more then worth the wait for one of Deaver's books.<br />The psychology of the people involved in this mystery is what makes the book so interesting. The impact of trauma on children who misinterpret the actions of adults happens every day in our society. Deaver explores the brain of an adolescent who has to deal with traumatic loss of his family by emerging himself in the natural world of insects...coping through something a child can make sense of. Into this world is drawn other people, whether they want to be there or not, and each person reacts differently to this odd young man, according to background and gender. All the people make assumptions based on evidence and emotions, and all of them end up being wrong about who has committed a crime.<br />As a deaf person who has friends who are in wheelchairs and also is a disabled rights activist, this reader feels Deaver does justice to the problems that come with being different. Especially for someone who became disabled through an accident, the trauma and grief is almost unsurmountable. The little things that are taken for granted daily are the very things which make life so difficult for a person who is learning to live with a disability. Deaver does us all a favor by reminding us of those very things we take for granted, as well as giving us a realistic protagonist who has physical and mental problems to overcome. Deaver also makes his protagonist deal with the people around him...those who love and care about him, and those who do not know how to deal with his disability. Rhyme is a realistic portrayal of disability...one that must deal with his difference on a daily basis, one who gets angry at the limitations that the world places on him and that he places on himself. The smiling poster children who never get depressed or angry, and who wait for 'normal' people to help them meet their needs is a bunch of baloney and needs to be erased from American society.  A terrific read in every way, shape, and form. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2001-05-07

I usually enjoy Haddam's mysteries, so this one was not as satisfactory as usual. I enjoy her protagonists, Demarkian and Bennis. I also enjoy the view into the life of both the Armenian neighborhood in which Gregor and Bennis live, as well as the sarcastic analysis of those who are so class conscious. This book is just loaded with tidbits about Americans whose main purpose in life is to accumulate wealth and show off that wealth. This side story is probably the best thing about this book. I had no problem figuring out who the murderer was pretty much from the beginning. Haddam loads her story with plenty of possible suspects, but unfortunately most of the characters are not well-fleshed out. I actually thought the epilogue was written much better then the rest of the book, having to do with the reason why Bennis had to rush to the hospital. The dialogue between Gregor and Bennis, as well as those who live in their neighborhoods is more realistic and developed then the dialogue in the rest of the book. Again, it is difficult for any writer to maintain interest in characters after fifteen books.  Karen Sadler, University of Pittsburgh	2001-05-01

I have not read Grafton for about a year. I think I caught up on all her books years ago, and was starting to get a little bored with the series. This particular addition was a fresh start though. Like the reviewers said, Kinsey opened up her personal life a little in this one and it made all the difference as far as making the protagonist seem more three dimensional and lifelike. Grafton's plots are usually well done. I enjoy her comments about California, the descriptions of the area in which Kinsey lives and also the descriptions of her landlord and his brothers, but I've never felt that Kinsey herself was described fully. This book gave a lot more character to her and I thought the story line and ending were...well, sweet (I know men hate that word, but the readers are mostly female). All of us have people we have judged wrongly, who have hurt us when they did not mean to. Sometimes we do get a chance to rectify the situation, and this was what Kinsey was trying to do with her life and her ex-husband. I agree with another reviewer who remarked on the title not being appropriate. I guess having started using the alphabet for the title, it kind of ropes you in to a limited amount of possibilities. I hate to be in Grafton's shoes if she makes it to X and has to come up with a title for that particular letter! Karen Sadler University of Pittsburgh	2001-04-16

This book was a gift for my husband who is an avid hiker. Since our home is in Pennsylvania, he is very familiar with local forests, like Allegheny National Forest and Cook Forest. However, Ohio is less then a half hour away, and he needed more information about where to hike and where to take the Boy Scouts for both hikes and camping trips. We never realized Ohio had such wonderful and great sites until we saw this book. The maps and descriptions and information about difficulty of hiking for the various trails are great (except at least one map we used need updating for changes in the path). What is really enjoyed is the historical information given. Sometimes the Scouts need to be given some historical information to make the hiking more interesting, and history always aids in making memories. For an example in the section on Beaver Creek State Park there are a bunch of old locks and damns. One of the locks on the canal was named after the daughter of a worker on the canal who died. Her casket was buried in the lock, and when the worker was finished in Ohio he dug up the casket to take it back to his country. The ship sunk on the ocean and both the worker and the casket were never retrieved. This type of story makes the history of the time period more accessible to both the Scouts and to anyone who is hiking in the area. It certainly is a good reminder of how easy our lives are compared to the 1800's...  Great reference book. Karen Sadler University of Pittsburgh	2001-04-15

The story is basically about politics, greed and dishonesty in the construction industry, with a little supernatural thrown in. Like another reviewer said, the short chapters that went back and forth between characters was slightly confusing, and the writing seemed sloppy and loose at the beginning. However, about half way through the book the writing and the plot got more concise and compact. It seems sometimes that few mystery writers especially in the states are incapable of writing a good plot and providing good characterization at the same time. Higgins is obviously one writer who provides an excellent plot. However, the people in the book did not seem three dimensional to me, and I would get to a chapter in the middle of the book and forget who the character was that the chapter was about (and I have a good memory). The book is a fun read, just disappointing in the characterizations. Karen Sadler, University of Pittsburgh	2001-04-08

In working on my PhD dissertation on eugenics, politics, education and the deaf and Hard-of-hearing in the United States I felt compelled to pick up this book since so many of the other books I am using in my research refer back to this classic. I had read one other of Gould's books and wasn't particularly impressed. However, this book is one of the best written accounts of scientific prejudice and bias, and the social impact of the science that comes from researching with a personal agenda. Gould obviously did a humongous amount of research, and backs up his claims that certain eugenicists were determining the outcomes of their research prior to any experimentation or testing.<br />The part on Binet and intelligence testing was especially well written. Much of it was information I had never come across before, and it was certainly ironic that the very fears Binet expressed about scientists and educators using IQ tests that he had developed to rank and classify people according to their perceived social worth became the reality. And that reality had its discriminatory basis here in the United States, much to my dismay. I guess I should not have been surprised...as one of the first deaf children to be mainstreamed into public schools in California, I was constantly pulled out of class and given IQ tests during 4th, 5th and 6th grades. It wasn't until later my parents found out about this and we understood they were trying to test me out of the system and into a school for the mentally retarded. I now have an MS in neuroscience from medical school and I am finishing up my PhD with over a 3.75 GPA with and without the use of decent interpreters in science. Apparently, the prejudice was still alive and well in the 60's and 70's...and since I know that that area of California got sued recently for not providing accommodations for the disabled and deaf...I guess not much has changed!<br />Gould is hilarious in this book. He is snide, smarmy, but everything he says is true and makes sense so he he has the right to be snide and smarmy. I don't blame him for being so outraged at all of these so-called scientists like Yerkes, Goddard, Laughlin, Broca, and many others who used their science to discriminate. It is still happening today, and bioethics is enabling the discrimination against those with disabilites, the elderly, or anyone else they consider useless lives. How nice to have someone like Gould come to the rescue of those who need protection. No one should have the right to determine what another person is capable of doing...I don't care how well educated they are. Many scientists I know are only experts in one area, and they completely fail at human compassion.<br />This book is a classic and deserves that title. It should be required reading for educators and scientists to make sure their own prejudices and biases do not dictate their behaviors and their work. I especially think that educational psychology departments who still use so many of these archaic tests and ideas should be required to read this book since they continue to perpetuate the idea that tests can determine the intelligence of a person, both present and future intelligence with no allowance for environment, language abilities, or future education.

It was by no means a horrible book. It just hackneyed. The plot used every current and popular issue...let's see she hit the occult (barely thank heavens), SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome with none of the attached medical arguments concerning it), irresponsibility by teenagers, of course a independent woman who decides to investigate the murder on her own, infidelity, fanatical religious beliefs (in West Virginia for heaven's sake...isn't that a little prejudicial) which border on or lead to insanity. There are so many characters that none of them get fleshed out to become real to the reader. All of the issues were touched on momentarily and in such a confusing manner that in the long run the mystery seemed contrived. The author makes Everyone look possibly guilty, and all the other woven in story lines such as the mother who was supposed to have abandoned her family, comes in at the last minute...then leaves and we have no idea where she went or why she is even necessary to the story. It could have been a decent mystery, but the writing leaves much to be desired. ...	2001-04-04

I've read the Shugak mysteries, and think I like them a little better than this group. Stabenow is a good writer, not a great one. The plot is interesting but confusing, especially with two separate murders to solve. What Stabenow is good at is characterization. She does a wonderful job of making the people in the book tangible and real. <br />Since I have Deaf friends in Alaska and family, I am well aware of the hardships of the fishing life up there. The regular trips they make out in storms and big seas make &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; look minor. This is part of their everyday life, and I admire anyone who has the stamina for it. <br />The people...well, they are odd. Not all of them, but enough to convince me that Alaska may be a nice place to visit, but you don't want to live there. Besides the winter darkness would drive me bonkers! Stabenow is also good at explaining the history of the state and its native people, and I thoroughly enjoy that in a mystery. Liam and Wy could use a little more rounding out...maybe I need to go back and read the first one. Some authors have a more difficult time then others writing from the viewpoint of the opposite sex. This may be the problem here since she is not merely writing from the woman's viewpoint as with the Shugalak mysteries. <br />The cracks about the looney and moody scientist (archeologist) and his protecting his discoveries to support his theory are right on target. I've read and met enough of these guys to realize too many of them will go to any lengths to protect their theories, even if they are wrong (which is distinctly unscientific!)

Too many professors do not realize that you cannot teach science out of context of history and social/cultural impact of the times in which the discoveries were made. So many times science is presented as the technological and mathematical sides of it, without portraying the human side of the story. Science does not exist in a vacuum, and despite what many 'scientists' believe their discoveries are not free from cultural and social bias.<br />The pictures and photographs add to the interest level and fun of reading this book. I enjoy seeing the older instruments, the drawings done by the original scientists, and photographs of the man with myasthenia gravis who was given anticholinesterase drugs to help with his affliction. This type of information puts a human face on dry science. Ultimately it is the application of what is learned in neuroscience used to relieve the suffering of those with chronic degenerative diseases which I find rewarding, not just the science as an end in itself. In fact, most of the men who made significant additions to neuroscience and understanding of the brain were trying to elucidate how the brain works in order to help those with these types of brain problems.<br />Finger does an excellent job. It is a long book, but immensely readable. Lots of information that was new to me, along with information that I had gotten glimpses from other sources (usually magazine articles in historical or lay science journals). This book should definitely be on hold in any university library where neuroscience is being taught, and if teaching neuroscience, professors should recommend to students to go and read the relevant chapters for historical background in this book.<br />There were a few scientists I would have liked more information on like Wilder Penfield. I would have preferred more recent (last 150 years) then all the early information from Greek history. That is a personal bias of mine, and not a reflection on the author who had to make choices of how much to put in the book about whom. I plan on keeping this book where I can reach it for papers and for teaching. I disagree with the reviewer who complained about all the references. I appreciate the referenced information, so that I know where to go for more information on a particular topic.

I brought a bunch of books home from my office and this was one of them. I had forgotten about it, and I have just read it again. Roueche was an excellent journalist writing for the New Yorker. He wrote about public health starting way back in 1944. This book is fascinating for several reasons. Not only is it a good explanation of what epidemiologists do for a living (the ones who don't deal with Level 4 viruses but the everyday disasters that still happen), but it is also a great history of public health in the U.S. Roueche was not a disaster monger. Rather he wrote about the men and women who literally had to hunt down clues about diseases, food-borne pathogens, stupid things parents did that led to the development of child safe medicine containers, etc. Some of these men and women put their lives on the line, and continue to do so when there are outbreaks of emerging diseases like Hantavirus in the Four Corners region, dealing with increasing cases of food poisoning, and now with the problems with prions (mad cow disease). He wrote in such a way to give us history and details that many other writers of health history often leave out. The information concerning the increasing amount of rabies being seen in the U.S. was news to me...I always thought it was native to this country, but apparently before the 1950's it was rarely seen. The chapter on aspirin, gave wonderful historical background, and brought attention to the need to make children understand that any medicine, whether flavored or not, is not candy. This book is a good recommendation for students in med school, for those who are interested in public health, and I think for high school science students to see the practical application of what they learn. I am going to go look for more writings of his...they are too enjoyable to miss! Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2001-03-21

This book had been recommended to me, and this was the first time that I had read anything by this particular author. It never ceases to amaze me the difference between American and British mystery authors. I have to wonder if part of it isn't that the British get better literature training in school? The ability to write well, develop plausible plots and interesting characters, and to continue to write that well over a long period of time seems to be the domain of British authors. <br />I loved this story. The thought of a town being flooded and coming into view again after a period of years due to drought is certainly unique. But it is not impossible as anyone who has been all over the United States, and seen the building of dams or witnessed a dam breaking. The entwined stories from World War II and the modern day discovery of a murder from that time period is so intriguing and different. <br />Robinson pays great attention to detail, not only in his characterizations but throughout the book. He does an extraordinary job of involving all the senses in the written word to give a three dimensional feel to the story. Too often little time is spent developing this trait...and it is this ability which makes movies from good books so hard to do well (they often are a disappointment because our minds have already pictured the book in a certain way). Because of how well this book is written, I will definitely go look for other books written by this author. His protagonist is very fallible, but very likeable. Terrific!

I enjoy picking up one of Jance's mysteries. She is one of the few mystery writers today that I feel I can count on for a decent plot and fairly well-rounded characterization. It also helps for me if I know the language is not going to be objectionable. I know in real life that people tend to use bad language, but luckily I am deaf so I don't hear it. I also prefer not to see it. Bad language, overwrought sex, and needless violence are signs of a bad author to me. Jance is a better then good author, even if occasionally the plots are getting predictable.<br />I love reading about Arizona since my grandparents lived there and it was part of my youth. I especially enjoy reading about the diversity of both people and wildlife down there, and about a woman as a sheriff and all the entanglements that go with it. Since I am familiar with the plant life in the area, the thought of anyone landing on a cholla made me cringe. As a bit of a klutz, I had landed more than my fair share of times in cacti, and it hurts! The major problem with this book that I could see is the plot had to be worked a little bit. I have a hard time as a mother seeing a woman putting herself in danger when she still has a child to raise. Maybe that is just me. The plot was a little convoluted, and I felt like it had not been planned out ahead of time as most of Jance's are. The evidence left in the dead woman's hand (no, I am not giving it away) was a little too pat for my taste, and made me suspicious from the start of the person who was being singled out for the suspect. <br />Jance's books are always a pleasure, even if I am a little demanding. I will continue to read her books and recommend them to others.  Karen Sadler, Science Education	2001-03-18

I took virology while in med school, and it made less sense to me then neuroscience did at first. Part of that was the presentation methods of the professors, and part of it was their refusal to use or even recommend a decent textbook to refer to. I found the monster books on virology they place in the reference section of the medical school library, but trying to afford those books on your own is impossible. And they were so technical and so detailed, that it did not give a decent overview of the field and you had to use the index to find what you wanted. Too big.<br />This book by Cann is a good addition to anyone interested in the field of virology. Since the emergence of new or at least never seen before diseases, more people are wanting to familiarize themselves with viruses, and now prions. I was a little disappointed at the short chapter on prions, but since this was on viruses I was expecting more than he needed to deliver. The text is well-written and concise, but limited in historical background which I think adds to understanding and interest. Placing discoveries of science in context of social and cultural background helps to tie primary information in with other memory, so that that information can be recalled. Since there are other books which provide the historical overview of the discovery of viruses and means to control them (vaccinations, etc.) it isn't absolutely necessary for this text to explain it. It just a personal preference I have where I think science should be placed in context of social and cultural norms, and the public health history aids in understanding why developing vaccines for some diseases was given priority over others. <br />This is a good and inexpensive book which can be referred back to for papers. I would highly recommend this particular text for those who are in virology classes, where the professors are not explaining to your understanding or satisfaction, or when you need to know more about the genetic makeup of viruses, or their ability to use normal cells to reproduce.

This book made a much larger impact on me then the last book of hers that I read. I will definitely remember her name and look for her books when I go to read an intelligent mystery. This particular plot is so intricately woven and has little gems of insight into the writings of Bret Harte, California, and the psychological impact of trauma on children and speech as to make it a wonderful read. I always enjoy it when authors take the time to do research into the basis of their story and Burke did a great job in incorporating all the facets into a sensible whole. <br />Burke's protagonist is different in that not only does she work in a newspaper, but she is also married. I rarely come across American writers who have married protagonists...makes you wonder if they think married women cannot possibly have interesting lives. Burke shows that this is not true, and makes her characters believeable. A totally enjoyable read. Karen Sadler,<br />Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2001-03-10

The reason no other person has written a review on this book is because probably few other people have read it. I have been reading it in conjunction with my work on eugenics and the impact on the deaf and hard-of-hearing in the United States. What does science literacy have to do with eugenics? The whole reason eugenics was possible in the United States from 1880 to the 1930s and beyond, is because people left 'science' up to the 'experts'...those who had science training, physicians, social workers, and some very questionable 'scientists'. These experts used science colored by prejudice to place marriage restrictions, sterilize those they considered less worthy of bearing children, and also to practice euthanasia and experimentation on the disabled in the U.S. Shamos makes the ridiculous argument that only those interested in science as a career should have exposure to scientific concepts, the rest of us 'illiterates' (whether female, minorities, or different abilities) should allow the 'experts' to make informed decisions about science and its impact on our lives. Shamos doesn't even bother to do the educational research to back up his general statements, and a good many of his statements border on offensive. This is a man who had the ear of science associations such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science. <br />What is so frightening is this book is recent, and he makes several of the same statements the eugenicists used to use about society and people doing what is best for society, and not for individuals. According to Shamos, most Americans cannot possibly fathom science concepts and so we should not waste our time teaching science in elementary and secondary schools. Rather than doing research into the best ways to teach science so all can understand, even if it means using multiple methods, Shamos excuses science educators and scientists from even trying since the masses are too stupid to be able to overcome generalizations or what he calls &quot;common sense.&quot; Rarely have I read a book which made me so angry. There is no excuse for laziness on the part of educators in teaching science for a lifetime, and there is no excuse for prejudices that dictate what individuals can and cannot do. Science pervades our lives, and in order to give informed consent to any science practice, all must have the education to question, whether medical, environmental, or any other science that impacts our lives. The right to restrict educational opportunity has no place anywhere, and it certainly has no place in the United States. Karen L.

Barr is definitely one of the current most intelligent writers of this genre. It is always a pleasure to pick up one of her books, because her writing is so well done and her mysteries tend to revolve not just around the who-done-it part of the book, but the interaction of her protagonist with her sister and other humans in the story. Since many of these national parks are places I would love to visit but probably won't be able to, she satisfies a need and also raises curiosity about places I had never heard of before. This ability on Barr's part is the sign of a good writer.<br />This particular mystery is given in bits and pieces. Just as in real life when family members are taking up our time, we tend not to be able to give the needed amount of cranial space over to our jobs or avocations, so to is Anna mainly concerned about her sister and unable to tie in the various pieces of the puzzle. The loving way in which the story between the two sisters is written is wonderful, and does not detract from Barr's mystery...rather it adds a sense of reality to it. The pieces were there, but the ending was a surprise to me. That is fine...I don't like my mysteries so easily solved that I have the solution in the first few chapters. <br />A good part of Barr's writing ability revolves around her characterizations. As a reader, I appreciate it when an author fleshes out the people in her stories. I want them to be three dimensional, and more like real people. I think part of Barr's success is the unusual employment of Anna. Many of us would have liked to go into working for the Park service, but the realities of life and families do not allow us that option. However, the portrayals of the people who 'invade' the parks and their idiosyncracies make for fun reading, especially when we recognize some of them. Barr also does us a service by pointing out the need to take care of our natural resources, and in this case, part of our heritage, Ellis Island about which I knew nothing.I look forward to reading her next novel, and wonder where we are going next!

This is not a lightly undertaken book to read. It is an exemplary work on the social, political and medical trends which led to neuro/psychiatric surgery being tried, accepted, and then discarded after research found it to be severely lacking in moral and therapeutic worth. Pressman did an outstanding job of research into the advancement of lobotomies in psychiatry as a means to control patients, who up til that time, had no resort or cure with which to treat these patients. The drugs which are used today to control schizophrenics and manic-depressives were not available in the early twentieth century, yet the advancement of regular medical science in both areas of surgery and pharmaceuticals raised the expectations of U.S. society towards those of psychiatric persuasion to find like means of treating the immense numbers of patients in state hospitals with mental illness.<br />Like many who went through medical school and biology/neuroscience, I was appalled to read about the use of lobotomies. This book endeavors with great fairness and accuracy to put the pressures of both society and science on psychiatrists into the picture, in order to create understanding as to why this means of treatment was pushed so hard, and why so many underwent a questionable method before it could be proven totally effective. Not only did Pressman write well and intensely about this, but his ability to put the topic into historical perspective and his impartiality towards both the method and the doctors involved made me rethink my prior prejudices towards these men. <br />This is a wonderful book, and not only should it be in medical libraries, but it should be part of the required readings for all medical students and ethicists. It is our great loss that Pressman died after this book was finished and too young, because his ability to write medical history and ethics could have been much used at this point.

His mysteries always give the benefit of the doubt to the reader assuming that we will be intelligent enough to follow along with the story, even if it takes bends that we might not foresee. This time he delves into the interesting history of Hell's Kitchen in New York city from the viewpoint of a black woman who has lived there all her life. As someone who has done geneaology and appreciates the need for visual and verbal histories, this was an extremely interesting book. The background and the history of the area could definitely make a book of its own, but of course the mystery is what draws the major attention here. Once again, I tend to shudder lest some wacko reads the book and takes ideas from the author's well-done plot, but I am well aware that much of this information can be found by anyone who really wants to find it. We just have to hope no one does exactly that.<br />The information on arsonists and fire fighting was interesting. Since Deaver has written more in-depth mysteries, this one was not as deeply involved as it could have been. It was an extremely enjoyable read though.

The writing in this book is absolutely incredible. The authors wrote this story with compassion for all those concerned, and did it without resorting to sensationalism. Like the story about the Titanic sinking, this harrowing fire which took the lives of close to a hundred children and three nuns provided the background for a much needed change in the construction of schools and implementation of fire safety standards throughout the United States. Since I started school within a couple of years of this disaster, it is with much sadness that I read that the safety of my generation in the schools came about because of this fire. This story and the writing is so well done and well researched, with little speculation, is such that I would not only highly recommend this book to others, but this would make an incredible movie (along the lines of The Perfect Storm) if they followed the format and integrity of the book. I think this narrative of Chicago, its firemen, the courageous nuns and priests, and most of all the children and the families needs to be told again lest we become complacent about the safety of our children.

This book is written by two men, one a doctor and the other a jouralist. Some people will find this a fun read, but it is written almost in the format of a novel rather than a history or biography. I think the authors felt the need to make the lives that these men lived and the curiosity and honor with which they chose to do their research needed to be expanded and told in ornate narrative, rather than telling the simple truth. When history is told in such a manner, and the authors tell things that they have no proof of happening (they are merely surmising) the story becomes a story. It is not history. The story of self-experimentation is filled with foolishness, courage, and concern for patients. It does not need to be enhanced by suppositions. <br />A much better and more recent book on this history of medical research is by Lawrence Altman. That book should be read prior to reading this one, which is unsatifactory in the historical sense.<br />Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2001-01-23

It has been almost fifteen yearrs since Randy Shilts published this book, yet it still pertains and is vitally relevant to us today. That Shilts is dead from the very virus he talks about in this book makes its words all the more distressing. Because of the prevailing attitudes of society and the medical community, HIV was virtually ignored when it came on the scene in 1981, and because of this fatal decision by politicians and scientists to pay little heed to a plague which seemed to be only affecting one small and unimportant population, many have died. The story of the mistakes made and the stupid things that people said and did is a parable which needs to be retaught over and over again. Perhaps because Shilts was so intimately involved in this crisis it gave him the impetus to describe so eloquently this period of time and the people involved. I think this book should be required reading for medical personnel, for would be science researchers, and for politicians. It is extremely important that we never let perceptions of others color our compassion or our science, or ultimately we as a society will pay the price. The legacy which Randy Shilts left behind is in this powerful book. Karen Sadler, Science education, University of Pittsburgh	2001-01-21

I used to enjoy ER when the writing was taut and reality-based. As it plummets into soap-opera I no longer wish to waste my time on it. This book is the verbal equivalent of what ER and the reality based trauma television try to convey but most often miss. Added to that is the unique vision and poetic writing of its doctor-author. Rarely have I come across a book which is so poignant and says so much in such compact cameos. Huyler is an extremely talented man with an incredible ability to narrate the daily life cycle of the emergency room. It is a priviledge to read and participate in this world, that so few of us understand or get the chance to see. This world placed on the small screen is not as glamorous or easy as they tend to make it look. The exhaustion, the emotional roller-coaster, the strange people that Huyler and his like have to deal with on a daily basis is almost unfathonable. It is with more sympathy that I understand why so many doctors and students choose not to work in such conditions and burn out or burn up so quickly. This book should be required reading for Congress and others who need to pass legislation to protect both medical students and the public from archaic requirements which leave those who work in emergency care exhausted and prone to mistakes. Huyler is a great physician who for the most part could handle the harrowing schedule and requirements of emergency medicine, but too many do not have his abilities or strength, and it is well-known that errors of judgement abound in hospitals due to exhaustion. A truly magnificent book. Karen Sadler, Science education, University of Pittsburgh	2001-01-20

If I could have given this book 4 and a half stars I would have done so. The only complaint that I have about this tome is that many of the court cases that I am interested in are not printed in part or entirety in this book. I will have to go to the law library to get the rest of the information that I need. This book was not in my law classes, but rather in a class for school administrators. I am writing on and very interested in the legal history of education, and this was a great find for me. Not only does it give pertinent information about all educational law, but the specific references and legal issues are there for gender and race discrimination in schools, busing, special education, etc. Any teacher, researcher, or lawyer in this field cannot just pick up a book that is only on their area such as special education, because the full information is not there nor does it make sense out of context of legal history. In order to understand the reason why Congress and courts saw the need to coin a new law (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) rather than rely upon previous ammendments to other laws such as the Civil Rights Act and other education acts in the 1960's it is vital that the reader know the history and how those ammendments failed to guarantee educational rights for those with disabilities. This book is a vital reference that provides this information, the legal history, and it is well worth the money spent on it. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2001-01-16

This book is one of the best written and researched books on education that I've had the good luck to come across. Winzer did a phenomenol job on what could be a dry subject. She also provides a great bibliography section which can further be used for references and research. I came across this book while doing research on deaf education and eugenics in the U.S. Not only does she have all the information that I had previously seen in books on the eugenics movement, but she provides more details and further references that the other books did not provide.  The struggle for educational equality for those with disabilities has been a long, ongoing battle. It is not yet finished, since educational equity is still elusive for those of us with disabilities. The same attitudinal problems which those people of different races have encountered, are even more engrained in society for those with disabilities. The idea of having a disability, whether physical, mental, or emotional and behavioral is still equated with the concept that we are intellectually deficient as well as being less abled in hearing, sight, mobility, etc. Even teachers and professors continue to put educational barriers in front of those with disabilities, and educational ethics has a long way to go for this particular group due to financial and political concerns in school districts and throughout social/political systems in the world.  It is only through good educational books such as Winzer has written that we can change the problems that people with disabilities face in education and employment, and equal opportunities. It is of utmost importance that educators of all kinds throughout the universities require that this book be read as part of regular educational requirements. Karen L.

Rennie Airth better be working on his next mystery with Madden as the protagonist, or I will be extremely disappointed. This book was definitely a work of art and of love. I am very curious to know about the member of Airth's family that he modeled Madden after. As always the British and now the South Africans write with class and intelligence, and it is nice to see a new detective in the manner of P. D. James' Adam Dagliesh. Like other readers I can easily see this being made into a movie or one of the Mystery series on PBS. The plot of this book is plausible, the characters are very well-drawn out, the involvement of World War I in shaping the minds and lives of those who live in England after the war understandable and obviously well-researched. This is probably the best new mystery and author I have read for at least two years. I hope to see more of him in the future. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2001-01-10

I put this book on last year's wish list and kept it there hoping someone would take the hint and buy it for me. My mother got it for me for Christmas this year, and I can tell it will be much used and appreciated. I chanced across this book, but at my time in life when my children are almost raised and I am almost finished with my schooling and embarking on my science education /bioethics career I am finding I want to make my home more orgaqnized and more homey for me to come home to. I am not a natural homemaker with an eye to placement and beautiful things. My mother is, as is Emilie Barnes. Some of us need a little help because our talents lie elsewhere. This book can be viewed for the way the Barnes have decorated their homes, and the writing is geared toward giving ideas for how to run a house more lovingly and cleanly. When I have time to do these things, I want to do them right. This book is loaded with ideas, plans, and future thoughts for making an individual house a home. <br />My only problem with this book is the one I have with Martha Stewart also...some of us just do not have the time or money to put that much effort into these things. Some of it is jealousy I suspect, on my part at the relative ease with which these people are able to use such unbelieveably unfair talents. Some of it is the emphasis that some of us choose to put on other parts of our lives. I want a beautiful home, but I want to be realistic too. Sometimes it seems as if realism does not enter into the thoughts of the author of this book. It is an outstanding book from an outstanding homemaker.

Thank heavens someone found this book and had it reprinted for the rest of us to read! It would have been such a waste of a wonderful writer and an interesting story if others had not had an opportunity to enjoy this. As written in this book when reading history, Carl Sagan said we need to remember to put the people in context of the social norms of the society they lived in. However, kindness never goes in and out of fashion, and this was well illustrated by the people, both good and bad, whom Minik had the unfortunate luck to fall in with. I knew from what little I had seen of Peary, that he was like many men and explorers of that period...egotistical, vain, pompous, full of himself, and oblivious to others. I did not realize how far these traits of his affected others. The absolute gall of this man to place the lives of other human beings in danger, which he most certainly knew he would be doing if he brought the Polar Eskimos to New York, is beyond infuriating. It is with great patience that Harper writes this book. As you can see, I would hardly be so magnanimous. Peary does not deserve any accolades for anything he did. He totally deserves to be relagated to the dusty corners of museums to which Peary left the family of Minik!<br />Harper does a wonderful job of writing. I have rarely read a biography or history book that reads as easily as a novel, as this book does. Perhaps it is the topic that is so interesting, but the author does such a complete job of telling the story with little biased or prejudiced input. He lets Minik's own words speak for themselves about how he felt about the situation he had been placed in. The book is void of speculation or assumptions that are often made by those writing history or biographies...no Freudian or other psychological analyzation is done on any of the characters in this story, even if the reader is wondering what the heck these guys were thinking or even if they were thinking!<br />Harper tells the whole story of thepeople involved even if detrimental to their memories. I have to say that even though Minik's foster father had done some things considered wrong in the eyes of the world (he played fast and furious with museum and business interests), in the end he did as much as he could to help his foster son, and certainly did much more than Peary or the other scientific nincompoops did.

I'm always a little leary of saying a book like this is fun. I don't want people to think that forensics is anything but a serious science, and one that is unfortunately used way too often in this world. I've always wondered why I am fascinated by this particular field, and it worries me less it says something bad about me. However, I can say that of all the professions especially in the sciences, forensics is the one that comes nearest to being able to solve puzzles and mysteries and still manage to get paid for it! When I see a book like Owen's I find it is hard to put the book down. Like other reviewers, I wish the author had put more information in the book about the techniques and the crimes. I did not recognize some of the crimes, so when the author refers back to them it is difficult to understand where the technique was used. The photography and graphics were phenomenol. For someone like me, who is deaf, graphic presentation is as important as the written presentation of the science. I feel like the author got all these pictures (and that was a lot of work doing this research, because I have not seen many of the pictures before)and did a rush job on the writing part. The book is still very good, and I think this is a valid book to refer to for people who are deciding whether or not to go into the particular field as a career. It is basic, but it provides enough information and 'gore' to see if a person can stand dealing with the awful situations in which forensic scientists are called upon to view. I know in medical school I was a little leary of if I was going to be sick when we had to go down to the morgue, for fear I'd get sick or not be able to do my work. I found out that it didn't bother me (except for children)and it did bother my interpreters (went through 3 in less then a month!) It is imperative for people who are even considering this field to look at a book like this to see how squeamish they are in dealing with this stuff. I know too many peoplewho tried to become doctors or nurses who had to quit because they could not deal with death and illness on a daily basis. How much more important is it for someone who will be exposed to violent death to decide whether this field is actually for them? This book would be a good career guide for this field. They no longer just use a coroner, but specialists in anthropology, entomology, firearms, photography, psychology, etc. and the need for these trained people is going to increase because of population increases. For the most part this was a good book, but be aware that the author does not give as much information about a lot of the crimes as many people want. This book is mainly about the science behind the police and prosecutors, and not about the crimes themselves. If the reader is interested in the crimes themselves, they will have to go elsewhere to find the information. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-12-17

Since I am Deaf and reading up on this stuff for a paper on eugenics and the deaf community, I was fully prepared to dislike this book (which doesn't make for a very scientific attitude!) So many of these science writers do not bother to get full information about the subject they are talking about, and I was concerned that in promoting genetics, Matt Ridley would not tell the whole story, including the black chapter (and ongoing one at that) concerning eugenics. He waits until the very end, but he does get to it. He more than tells the story, he paints it out for the reader and gives smart and irreverent asides while doing it.<br />Ridley is right. Those who come at this book from a layperson's point of view need to know that genes are more then the diseases which are so prominently displayed in the media. Each of the chapters/chromosomes are loaded with information, and sometimes the gene for certain traits and specific diseases or disorders are too close in relationship to that gene. If we go clipping out those genes which offend us willy-nilly, such as manic depression/bipolar disorder, will we also clip the gene for creativity or artistic talent? Knowing that many artists have been known to be bipolar, do we even want to attempt to remove manic depression from the germ cell line when it may mean the loss of a spectacular artist? What a boring world ours would be if diversity was lost because of the decision of society to totally irradicate disease, usually for the &quot;good of society&quot; rather than for the benefit of the individual.<br />Ridley did a phenomenol job in writing this easily read book. If anything it is too short, too compact. Squashing the amount of information out there on the prion controversy into one chapter is great for alerting the general public, but in the process a lot of interesting information is left out and what information is available in the chapter may be too superficial to make an impact on the minds' of the readers. However,as always it is great to see science being made accessible to everyone, and this book certainly makes the genome accessible. I am a scientist, but I had forgotten about all the junk DNA and was wondering how they could have finished mapping the human genome so quickly. Ridley's book gave vital information that I had missed. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-12-13

Man, when I bought this book it wasn't what I thought it was. If someone had warned me this was from some of the guys pushing the &quot;HIV does not cause AIDS&quot; following, I would have never picked it up. I had the opportunity to work with the HIV virus for 3 years, and there is no question in my mind that it is a lethal virus that leads to AIDS, which is a syndrome of multiple diseases, cancers, symptoms which occur due to the breakdown of the immune system. There are too many people I've seen who were infected with the HIV who priorly were healthy individuals, who ended up dying from this for me to agree that another &quot;unknown&quot; virus could be responsible for this devastating disease.... If psuedoscience purports that a certain idea or virus is responsible for a great many diverse diseases/syndromes, then it is too good to be true. I also feel like anyone who has a persecution complex like these guys do, that they probably have little in the way of concrete proof.

I've long wanted something with artwork by James Christensen. His work is magnificent, his art geared to fantasy usually. This book however was given as a present by my sister. I use it for teaching the parables to my Sunday School class, and as one of the few books laying out where others can see it. The book is well-done, and well-laid out. Of course, the pictures draw the eyes and the amount of detail is fascinating to children. The parables are classic stories, no matter what religion you are...like many other religious stories, they teach everyone the same thing. In this day and age, when so many children and adults need basic training in kindness, in charity, in placing your trust in right things (rather the wrong ones such as money)...this is a beautiful way to reteach those lessons.

First off, with a book like this, who is the author? I assumed it was Clancy, but now I am not so sure. What does it mean when two other men are the &quot;creators&quot; of a thriller? Did they come up with the concept and the first listed person is the actual author? If so it is very difficult to know who to give praise or critism to, or maybe that is the idea? I have enjoyed Clancy's books for several years. They make a good intelligent change of pace from my usual readers diet of science, education, ethics, mysteries, and history. He is a good writer even though I think he churns out the books too fast. However, since I am not sure who wrote this book, I don't know to whom to give the credit.<br />The near completion of the human genome and the emergence of diverse infectious diseases which are new to us make for plenty of possible and scary scenarios. Obviously this group of men has tapped into this large reservoir. The problem is when someone who does not have the science background reaches for a book like this, and it is a middle of a series...the authors make assumptions about what the reader knows about genetics and disease, and where they have come in in reading the series. For me it wasn't a problem because I worked on HIV and am working on the ethical implications of the Human Genome project for the disabled. However, most of the people who I know who read this type of book for pleasure, would have definite problems following the back-and-forth writing of the plot, and a lot of the genetic information is going to seem very improbably to those who do not read Science on a regular basis. <br />This is a good book, with a good plot and decent characterization. The science is pretty good, and I hope the authors don't give the wackos out there any new ideas. Probably not...like I said, this is currently an area of immense concern and immense discussion. This is definitely more intelligent writing than say Robin Cook (who started this genre), but it is not easyreading for those who are looking for something that does not require a few active brain cells (which I sometimes want too!)

She is an excellent writer, and she has picked a genre which is often the territory of male writers, and tends less to be fictionalized but &quot;true crime&quot; mode. Her stories have a basis in fact, and it is very apparent that she reads FBI profiling/reports on serial murderers. I've yet to read an answer to my inquiry by either her type of writer or someone like John Douglas, the noted/original profiler for the FBI, why this type of criminal seems to be more prevalent in our time period.<br />This is a good story, with good characterization. I have to admit I couldn't figure out who the serial murderer was, even though I had my suspicions. This is typical for Hoag's books...she leaves you totally oblivious to the truth until the end. However, a word of caution. For the many readers of suspense and mystery out there who pick up Hoag's books...be aware she writes hard, like a cop or military man. The language is foul, the story lurid in both sex and violence. This is not your typical light mystery read. It gets to the point for me where I just do not want to read this type of stuff anymore or fill my mind with its horrors. I feel that way about a few authors including especially when they deal with more realistic crimes, and especially those who target women and children.... <br />Hoag is an excellent writer. I'd like to see her try her hand at some serious history, even if on the criminal side. For those who enjoy this stuff, this is a great book. I do not think I personally will be reading her books of this genre again. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-11-21

Yes, the doctor does write rather 'high-falutin'. I haven't met the guy, but if he is like many other of the doctors I met in med school...some of them come by their language honestly. Maybe he was raised in a home where language was spoken that pretentiously. If so, then there is more to admire about him. Doctors do not have to choose to work with members of society who are less fortunate. Especially one of Baxter's caliber. That he did raises him in my esteem, and impresses me all the more. He writes with compassion and with a sense of humor, which is necessary to deal with such a hard field. AIDS does not suffer fools lightly, and Baxter is no fool in spite of his language. He does an excellent job of making others aware of the real life of most with HIV. Very few are actually lucky enough to have insurance which will pay for the pharmaceutical &quot;cocktail&quot; which is necessary to maintain life, and even some who do have access...their bodies reject the drugs and they become worse. The  AIDS crisis is far from over. We Americans have merely closed our eyes to that fact. Baxter tries to alert us to the needs of those who are dealing with day-to-day tragedies.

This book is one of the reasons I prefer reading the books first, then see the movie. I do not think I would have read the book if I had seen the movie first. This genre is not my usual choice for reading, but once again so much information had been in the newspapers, on television, and recommendations by friends that I decided to give it a whirl. I was not disappointed in the book, the plot, the writing, or anything else. The story fluctuates between the healing of both the daughter and the horse, and the mother's own story. Since I was raised around horses, and have become very interested in the more humane ways of 'training' a horse and its extension to other animals, I found this part of the book enthralling and informative. The only reason I don't give the book a five star rating is because I am not sure how the book will withstand time...will it continue to be a classic, or was it just the favorite for a year? <br />I enjoyed the movie too, but as usual, my imagination does a better job filling in than a movie screen. We are ultimately somewhat disappointed in the portrayals of the characters in the books with those chosen to play the part on screen. Robert Redford was fine, but I am not sure that others would have played the other main characters better. The book will last longer and last better than the movie.	2000-11-20

As a deaf person who has struggled long and hard to get my PhD in science and science education, this book with its history comes as no surprise to me. Harlan Lane is a hearing person who has taken up the cause of those in the deaf world with a vengence, and I do mean with a vengence! Dr. Lane has a tendency to write with immense vigor and sometimes his books tend to go overboard in stating the case. However, this book is a classic and is definitely one of his best written ones. <br />The history of the deaf in the United STates is strewn with great minds and small minds. We have had people who supported our education, and those who mistakenly viewed us as being less worthy of the normal needs and desires of life. This includes having a life, getting an education, living in society, being able to find gainful employment, getting married, and having children. The research of Dr. Lane is impeccable, and I have found it useful to refer to him in papers and use his references/bibliography for my own work on discrimination against the deaf in science education. Even if I sometimes do not agree with Dr. Lane's biased outlook on history of the deaf, I certainly appreciate all that he has done to bring the sometimes terrible prejudices and misdeeds to the attention of the hearing public. Yes, the deaf were and continue to be discriminated against, just as other differences are whether a disability or racial/cultural minority. Those who wish to understand the extent to which this discrimination went, should definitely read this book. To an extent, those of us with life-long hearing differences are learning to advocate for ourselves, and take pride in our accomplishments. It is thanks to people like Dr. Lane that we have been able to reach this point over the past 40 years. Karen Sadler, Science education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-11-20

I ended up taking a class at school in the education department because so many teachers/educators are using the Internet for a variety of reasons. As a Deaf person, this turned out to be one of my more 'difficult' classes because everyone was in front of a computer, the room was large, the professor wandering around (so no lipreading), and it was dark as they were using a projector from the computer screens. Ugh, major hassle! I could not see either an interpreter or a computer assisted real time captioner. Besides the fact the stenographer was not paying enough attention to do what she was being paid to do. So I did what I usually do, and ran and got some extra books to back up what I was not getting in class. This book definitely fit the bill. It was simple, clear, concise, and had illustrations. Whatever the topic was in class, I could find something on it in this book. I see he has updated for all the changes made in the last few years. I hope Ackermann continues to do this as more students like me with disabilities try to attend college. I recommend this highly to my students and lend it out when needed.

I am always a bit leary of picking up a work of fiction about which I know nothing and I am not familiar with the author. I learned during college the first time around that just because a book is widely recommended or even considered a 'classic' it does not mean that it will be something that appeals to me, or even that it is good writing. I do not watch Oprah, partially because I am deaf and partially because I do not watch daytime TV because I am not home...I am a scientist and educator, and I do not have the time to waste. This book was more than worth the time spent reading it, and I think I read this one in two days (in spite of all the school work I had to do). The story of midwives even now, reflects the efforts of women to make strides into the world of men. Too many times a mistake on a woman's part is made into a big deal, when a mistake on a man's part (especially if they have a degree by their name) is ignored by the public and the media. As someone who has been through medical school for neuroscience, and also a deaf activist, I am very aware of the many 'mistakes' made by male physicians, who endangered the lives of women who trusted them, and babies who had no way to give informed consent. Yet these men continue to practice medicine with no fear of repercussions, or simply move to another state. Their 'mistakes' seem not to bother them at all.<br />The women I know and see in medical and research fields tend to be acutely aware of every little mistake they make. They also feel deeply for the women they care for...not always, but as a rule. The women who I know who are obstetricians or pediatricians are compassionate, whereas the men tended to treat me and other pregnant women as just another body, just another face. I have seen women agonizing over the loss of a baby, and frantically trying to save my life as well as others. I know they &quot;take their work home&quot; and that the impact of doing that on their families must be agonizing.<br />This story would not have had the effect on me that it did without the fine writing by Mr. Bohjalian. His ability to place himself into the emotions of his characters, especially the young daughter who watches her mother disintegrate in the face of false accusations and her own questioning mind, is superb. This ranks as one of the most wonderful books I've read in the last ten years, and for once, it was done without the need to pander to those who enjoy raw language, violence, and sex.

I was surprised to find that no one had written a review about this book. I know it has been used as a recommended textbook at the University of Pittsburgh in Deaf Education and Educational Psychology, and it was recommended to me by at least four professors. This may constitute part of the problem in deaf and special education, and regular education in public schools for deaf and hearing impaired children. The little amount of research that is being done by people like Marc Marschark, who is a genius in my opinion, is not filtering down to those who need to use this information in making sure that equal opportunity to education is available to these children, no matter what environment they are placed in. <br />I specifically went to read what Marschark has written about intelligence, memory, and attention in deaf children. Since I am totally deaf, I recognize some of the problems that arise when a child is presented with nothing but verbal/oral material in a learning situation. Marschark did more research than he needed to or others would have done, and he pulls all the research together to make a comprehensible whole. The references he  provides in this book are valuable for referring back to and reading on their own, since he places them in context. This book was published in 1993, and I really think an update is needed because neuroscience has found out some significant information over the last few years that apply to teaching and understanding the workings of the mind in the presence of deafness or hearing loss. For example, it has been shown that prelingually-deafened adults use their auditory cortex when lipreading or using American Sign Language. This indicates a rewiring of the brain which occurs in children whose deafness is caught early enough to use manual language with or teach lipreading skills to. This information could be vitally important in teaching those with hearing loss, and also be used to pressure Congress to demand that all newborns be tested for hearing loss prior to leaving the hospital. The importance of determining hearing loss early is mandatory to providing these children with educational opportunities early enough to make up for their diversity (I refuse to call it a disability when the Deaf community does not recognize it as such).<br />Marschark writes well. The book is immensely readable. He also provides enough information to show that deafness does not equate with lack of intelligence, for which I am supremely thankful.

In educational departments in universities, too often more importance is placed on rote learning and not on helping learning to be an enjoyable experience. I am afraid too many teachers are being churned out that feel the pressure to produce for standardized testing, without realizing that learning this same information can happen in such a way as to make it enjoyable, make sense, and be remembered for a lifetime. At this time, too many times students remember for only short-term recall, and then promptly lose the knowledge after the test. Learning is a continual and lifetime process, and Frank Smith reiterates the mistakes that teaching in the U.S. is making in emphasizing the wrong way to learn.<br />The information Smith gives is vitally important, and he makes several very quotable statements concerning learning and memory which I have used (citing him) in papers. The book is almost too short, and not as readable as I would have liked it. Nevertheless this is an absolute must read for educators, and for would-be teachers prior to entering their teaching jobs. It is also important for those going into educational research and educational testing to be aware of. We can and should expect children to learn, but we definitely are not approaching it the right way. This book can provide plenty of topics for discussions in education departments across the country. Testing should not be the ends, but rather the ability to learn over a lifetime and the ability to continue this process from indirect sources once out of the school system.

The writing is adequate, the plot okay, but I really do not like my mysteries reading too much like a romance novel. I also prefer to have my characters well-drawn out, and I did not feel that Heggan did a good job at this. I picked this book up at the library, but I don't think I will be reading any more of this particular author's work. I don't have the time to waste. To be fair to the author, there are many readers out there who would enjoy this book because it does not make any demands on the reader. It is light suspense reading, and for some people that is all they want. If you are reading for enjoyment and entertainment, and you like romance and suspense together in your mysteries without a lot of depth, then this book and this author are for you.

I really enjoy Elizabeth Peter's series with the main characters of Amelia Peabody and her various family members. I especially like the information given concerning Egyptian artifacts and history, and also the humor with which the characters are drawn out. Peter is usually an excellent writer, and her plots are fairly well-drawn out even if they tend to be predictable sometimes. It is part of reason so many enjoy reading her mysteries is that the characters have become well-known to her readers, and the story-line is well-done. <br />The current story is fun, however, Peters has changed her format in the last few books, including a 'manuscript' which is believed to belong to Ramses, the son of Amelia Peabody. It gives Ms. Peters the opportunity to present the story from 2 different points of view rather than just one. The reason for doing this is understandable. However, the book was long and the plot got confusing after a while with all the going back and forth between the different narrators and keeping up with what each of the characters were doing. This was merely an inconvenience, not enough to make me quit reading the book, nor will it keep me from reading future mysteries by Ms. Peters.

Dr. Feynman is definitely someone who I would have liked to have had for a teacher and as a friend. His unique vision of the world, and his proprensity for practical joke playing as a means to teach others are right up my alley. This was one of the smartest people who ever lived, because intelligence lies not just in the ability to do something like physics well, but in the ability to convey how interesting it is to students, to encourage others, to solve problems, and do all of this with a sense of humor. Howard Gardner talks a lot about multiple intelligences. This was a man who was larger than life, and displayed more intelligences in one person than he actually had a right too! It is too bad that he wasn't appreciated in life as he has been after his death. In science sections of bookstores you can see how popular his writings and information about him has become.<br />The book is given a four mainly because the format is dry. It does not detract from the subject matter, at least not in my view. Were that more scientists were able to view their lives and their work with a sense of humor.

Oh geez, I have never laughed so hard. This guy is definitely one of the funniest doctors and columnists that ever existed. I needed something to lighten the research I am doing currently on eugenics and the deaf community for my dissertation, and this book fit the bill. London, if that is really his name, had a capacity to see the humorous and explain it to the general public in such a way, that we see the the situation as he perceives it. That is the sign of a great writer. He also obviously takes his whole profession with a large grain of salt, which is so widely missing in most physicians. It's like the teach LackofHumor 101 in medical schools...they are not allowed to be funny or see anything funny in what they do. Thank heavens London does not feel that way, or we would be missing some major yuks!

This was the favorite catch-all psychological and social term from the 1850's to at least the 1940's. In their quest to prove that feeble-mindedness was inherited Davenport and Goddard in the United States 'found' a family who they thought illustrated their beliefs in the finest way. In the process they denigrated a family history on the basis of a pseudo-science which used no scientific methodology but rather labeled an entire family based on their perception of this family's looks and abilities.<br />What is even more sad is that the woman who ended up in Goddard's institution for the feeble-minded for her entire and long life, was actually a beautiful and given the environment she was placed in, accomplished person. And she was placed there because the step-father of her family did not want children in the household who were not his. <br />This book was written by Smith to shred the evidence that the eugenists used to black-ball this family. He wrote a short rehistory of the family, and did research which showed that the eugenists went so far as to retouch pictures to make the family look worse. He also did a fine job of showing the completely unscientific methodology used to prove the eugenic theory of inherited poverty, feeble-mindedness, and criminality. Smith finally clears the name of this family by proving Goddard as what he was--a prejudiced charlatan with no thought except for his own fame.<br />With the near completion of the family genome, and the specter of eugenicism raising its ugly head again, it should be considered by the publishers to reprint this book as a reminder of how social attitudes affect science. I think it is also needed to once again continue to clear this family's history (even though the names are made up) because so much was written to denigrate them.<br />Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-10-24

I enjoy reading both her books on Sheriff Brady, and the mysteries based in Seattle. But because she is a woman and therefore knows the idiosyncracies of being a woman in a man's profession, the writing often is more concise and sympathetic in this series. Brady's got all the fun of juggling family problems (including parents and in-laws) while trying to hold down a job and get people to take her seriously.

I am researching bioethics and especially eugenics in the United States as far as it concerns the Deaf and Hard-of-hearing. Because I work in the university bookstore, I went to see what the classes which teach bioethics are using for textbooks.  Dr. Pence's books were being used, and as I looked through them, I could see he dealt with many of the topics I am concerned with...allocations of scarce resources, infant non-treatment on the basis of disability, and the worth that our society puts on the life of someone with a disability. (Nice story about a Deaf-mute who wasn't informed he was going to be the experiment for piggybacking a chimp heart). <br />Dr. Pence is an excellent writer. This book was an easy and interesting read. It told details concerning prominent cases that I didn't know, and he gives the references to everything, so that makes my research much easier. <br />Again, this is one of those books that is a must-read for medical students, anyone in public health, educators, and the disabled. Knowledge is power. We can only protect ourselves in the medical community when we know about the conflicts of interests that doctors and researchers face, and how ethicists and politicians perceive not only the disabled, but everyone. In this new world where the Human Genome Project is almost finished, and doctors are already clamoring for testing of all newborns (and fetuses), and there are no protective laws on the books against discrimination...it is very apparent we may possibly have another eugenic movement on our hands. It is up to all of us as informed readers to read someone like Pence and get involved with legislation to stop this from occurring again.

I am a Deaf woman who uses ASL both at school, at work, and also at my church. I bought this book for a family with 3 children of a variety of ages with the youngest boy being six or seven. He is very interested in signing, and watches both me and my interpreter like a hawk. When I sign sing or teach the children at church to sign sing, these 3 would always consistently sign and do it well. To encourage those who want to learn how to sign, especially children, I tend to buy books or CD-ROMs for them.  The need for decent interpreters is tremendous, and just as those who are activists in the Deaf/disabled community are pushing for ASL to be taught as a second language in schools, we try to encourage those around us who express an interest. The drawings are great. The vocabulary is more than a beginner's ABC book. The book will not teach syntax or how the Deaf community uses their language, but it is a good place to start. Again, I have to emphasize the difficulty in teaching a 3 dimensional language with a book which is limited to 2 or 1 dimension. But anything that encourages children to learn a language and perceive the Deaf as equals with a different language (and interesting) is to be lauded. I always tell children and adolescents that signing for the Deaf is a great way to put themselves through college...in Pittsburgh, the rate is between $25-$35 an hour, and ASL is used at schools, in courts, at hospitals and doctors.

I have not read Mr. Davis before, so I don't know what he is capable of. This was not a book that could be easily read in one sitting. The set-up of the book where it goes back and forth between the jury and its characters, and the Prime Minister searching for his brother and the real killers, and the kidnappers, does not make for easy, consistent reading. The plot felt like it was broken up, even though I thought the problems with the enviro-terrorists and chemical/pesticide companies were and are very plausible. The book just lacked some cohesiveness to it. I will probably try one of Davis' books again, because he is obviously an intelligent writer.

I do not have the linquistic background, or the patience for that particular venue of study. However, I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Iliad this time around rather finding it as a task I had to get through. Maybe it is just being older, but I think a lot of it had to do with Fagles' fine translation of this classic. They continue to use this version in many classes at the University of Pittsburgh, and when I have friends who have to read the Iliad, I tell them to go look for this particular translation. How accurate Fagles is I will leave up to academia to argue over...all I know is that I got an A+ in the class thanks to him. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-10-02

Then toward the middle the plot got more convoluted which is the way I like it. Archer is a fairly good writer, and obviously has enough experience within this diplomatic community to know or be able to get information on what is going on. It was a surprise to me to find out Archer is British, and writing about American groups. Occasionally I wonder if these groups such as the CIA, FBI, and England's own similar groups are as morally ambiguous as Archer and people like Tom Clancy indicate they are. If so, maybe the media and public ought to get more involved in policing these groups. However, this was an enjoyable and quick read. I plan to read more of his work in the future.

I then came across this one in my search for more material  having to do with the Deaf in Germany. This book was originally a  dissertation, however, Gallaudet Press and the translater, William Sayers,  did a great job in turning what would be a dry dissertation into a short,  but interesting book.<br />Horst Biesold is an interpreter who in the  performance of his job, came across members of the German deaf community  who were finally willing to tell their story about being forced to undergo  sterilization. He writes with obvious concern for and about his deaf  clients, and the emotional and psychological impact that the eugenics laws  had on these people. It is with concern and dismay that I am researching  the same subject only in the United States, since the Nazis often wrote  that many of their ideas and programs were first proffered by eugenicists  in the U.S.<br />This book is a good reminder that when societies don't stand  up for what is right, even when it does not directly affect most  individuals, you cannot tell how far the 'slippery slope' is going to go.  The Holocaust did not just become the Final Solution for the Jews, but  included the gypsies and the disabled, and those who were considered 'life  unworthy of life.'  With the completion of the Human Genome Project, and  proponents of euthanasia getting more vocal, and doctors like Kervorkian,  and HMOs who put their bottom line before the worth of people...it is all  too possible that this horror could happen again, and in this country. I  urge ethicists, physicians, and educators to read this book as well as  members of the deaf/disabled community so that we can protect ourselves  from those who would put less value on our lives for whatever reason.

I actually enjoyed this book more than his first, The Mindhunters. Douglas  is an excellent writer, and even though some have complained about his  discussion of these men as cowards, I think it is only fair to say that  most people having been in his position and have his job would also have  strong emotional opinions about what he saw of these very disturbed people.  As a neuroscientist who understands that brain patterns may be different,  and knowing people who were raised in less than ideal situations, I am  afraid that I agree with him about the statement he made concerning  'choices'. Many people have had difficult lives but CHOOSE not to take it  out on other people. <br />It is like someone who has familial alcoholism in  their families. If they know that the family has addictive tendencies  toward alcoholism, then they make the choice to never take that first  drink. If they choose to drink, then more choices are taken away from them,  like being able to drive without endangering the lives of others. Yes,  there is a point where families should be on the lookout for certain  behaviors from children, and then get the psychiatric help they need...but  there is no excuse for most of these men who choose to hurt animals and  then later people. <br />I thought Mr. Douglas' statements about choice and  about violence in the schools, are something that educators need to hear.  By the time that these men have reached the point where they are killing  through whatever means, the time for compassion is over. They offered no  compassion, and mostly no thought to their victims except for how it would  make them feel. They deserve no compassion from the rest of society. My  compassion is saved for the victims and people like the brother of the  Unabomber who turned his brother in. He is deserving of our compassion, not  his embittered brother who made the choices along the pathway of his life  that led him to do what he did. He didn't even have the excuse of bad  parenting. <br />As an educator and a parent, I am tired of excuses being made  for these people by psychiatry. Even if there is physical proof of illness,  there are still choices involved. To take medication, and stay under  control, or go off the medication and hurt others. Douglas merely echoes  how many of us feel and think concerning these cases, and does it in an  organized manner. I understand more about motive now and how the brains of  these men deviate from the norm. Karen Sadler, Science  Education,<br />University of Pittsburgh	2000-09-06

I actually went to read this book because I enjoy David McCullough's  writing so much. I can see how as he has continued writing over the years,  his writing has gotten stronger and much tighter. He had the talent to  write a great first book on a natural/man-made catastrophe. As a first  book, it is not as well written as his others, but the information that he  researched so well was magnificent. I had read other versions of the  Johnstown flood in the Smithsonian, but this one gave significantly more  information. It has always been assumed that Carnegie and the other wealthy  owners of the club were solely responsible for the condition of the dam  above Johnstown. But there were many times that others, including the  residents of Johnstown, were equally known to have concerns about the dam,  yet no one did anything about it. Earthen dams have broken since then  including one above Rick's College in Idaho. They are not as reliable as  well engineered dams such as Hoover Dam in Arizona. Yes, the wealthy men  chose not to do much at the time of the incident, but Carnegie spent the  rest of his life giving to various charities, partially out of guilt  probably for what happened at Johnstown.  McCullough does a fair job  presenting all sides of what happened, and as I stated, his research is  impeccable. This is history written in its finest form, without yellow  journalism.

Our generation born in the fifties and sixties were raised to believe that  certain types of crime are prevalent now due to lax morals, divorce and  family abuse, and that the 'good old days' were carefree and crime was  significantly less. It has also been stated that the urban sprawl is  conducive to development of criminal activity. After reading this book, my  opinion of all this is baloney!<br />I don't usually read true crime.  I enjoy  mysteries and forensic science as a science, but choose not to dwell on  this topic...I vary my reading greatly from day to day, to make sure that  my mind isn't feeled with negative stuff. I found this book at the library  and from reading the back reviews decided to read it. It amazes me that  this woman was allowed to continue her murderous quackery for so long, but  remember that the easy access of media to information and the development  of the FBI and their bureau dealing with serial murderers was not on the  scene at that point. It is well-known there are many fewer women serial  murderers then men, and this is a topic of increasing interest to  psychologists and criminologists. I think however, that there are many  cases of  this type happening which are unknown because on the whole serial  murders are very intelligent and many probably do not get caught.<br />The  book is repetitive. The author tends to go back and say the same things  over again in different chapters. It could have been more tightly written.  He did his research, but he also speculates too much. The story would have  been much better without the speculation on what people were thinking. What  they said and wrote would have been enough. It must be difficult to  research crimes done that far back, but obviously there was enough of a  paper trail to follow this woman's deeds. I sincerely hope that the checks  and balances of the medical profession and police/FBI are enough to keep  something like this from happening again. I am not absolutely sure theyare...

This book is  a magnificent story about the battle between big corporations and a small  group of people who were striving to find a way to communicate with each  other and with the hearing world. It is very ironic that Alexander Graham  Bell was attempting to find a way to assist the Deaf (his own wife was  Deaf) when he started developing the phone, yet his creation became the  bane of our existence. Until the development of the computer and email, the  phone was the ultimate barrier for those with hearing impairments to  participate in the 'normal' world through education, employment, and  necessaries such as calling the doctor for an appointment. <br />Dr. Lang  tells the story of 3 courageous and very different men who wanted to  rectify this communication deficit for the hearing impaired community. What  started out in homes and garages much as the history of PCs did in the San  Francisco Bay Area, spread throughout the U.S., and much of the effort had  to be spent trying to get corporations such as AT&amp;T to cooperate. It is  unbelieveable the amount of obstacles raised by the very group who would  benefit (in increased revenue from a priorly non-using community) were the  ones who made things so difficult for these men. Yet persistence from all  of them led to an invention/tool which is much used now and taken for  granted by all of us who became deaf later in life. <br />This history is  well-written and well-documented, and it should be required/recommended  reading for those in communications, as well as those who are deaf or who  work with the deaf. Changes in the TTY, increased private/public computer  use, and changes in federal laws such as the ADA and rulings by the FCC  have led to increased use of this method of communication, and the  increasing availability of TTYs in public places. It has also led to  innovations in computer use, and prompted attitudinal changes which were  much needed.  Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-08-05

The Joy of Signing was in use in 1990 at the University of Pittsburgh when  I started my studies there. When I was told I had to take a foreign  language, and I started laughing because I am totally deaf...the  advisors/university 'allowed' me to take ASL to fulfill those requirements.  This book continued to be used until the mid '90s, because it was  accessible to everyone and had the best drawings of any book on the market.  As with most dictionaries of a 3-dimensional language, this one is  inadequate in that it cannot give a full representation of the sign. It was  also insufficient in that it based its format on that of the English  dictionary, which is a totally different language than ASL. Rather than  basing it on the structural components of ASL, the dictionary brought up  words in alphabetical order. Since so many words have multiple meanings and  so many signs are used for multiple words, this format is very difficult to  look through to find an accurate sign. It is also not as useful as other  books for Deaf people who are looking for specific English words to their  signs.<br />The use of videos and video streaming photography on the computer  has allowed the introduction of ASL as a 3-D language. Even though other  books (usually with videos) have replaced The Joy of Signing at Pitt and I  am sure at other universities, the book holds a fond place in my heart and  on my shelves. The authors are commended for the introduction of ASL to a  generation of people and for helping in  promoting ASL as a true language  in its own right.

I am always disappointed when I don't find a new one out or  available. He cannot write fast enough to please me. His historical  mysteries are not the lightweight reading that most of the female writers  of this genre are. His books are heavy with history and information, heavy  on atmosphere, heavy subject matter to deal with the seamier sides of life  in the 'good old days.' From the nonfiction history I've read and Carr's  books, I am thoroughly glad I didn't live in the good old days. <br />His  books draw what seem to be accurate pictures of New York City at the turn  of the century, and his use of an alienist as psychologists were called  then, is an interesting and different means of looking at crime. Many  people feel that crime is more prevalent now then eighty years ago, but  that isn't necessarily true. We just are informed of it more often through  improvement in media, and they can do a better job of linking people to  crimes through improvement in criminology (fingerprinting, DNA use, etc.).  Many of the things that were acceptable behavior back then are regarded as  criminal today, such as spousal and child abuse, and people just didn't  talk about private matters such as this. Caleb Carr's book The Alienist  brings the world of that time period alive for those interested in it.  Karen sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-08-02
2341767:US	53067930	R3FXEGYEQEFLXT	0807846759	925622904	The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution	Books	5	25	28	N	Y	Disturbing, researched account of beginnings of Holocaust	As a Deaf person and an activist for the rights of the disabled in education and medical care, I was appalled to find out that the disabled  were singled out for sterilization and euthanasia long before the Jews had  been. I was even more upset that prior to medical school, I had never even  heard of the willing collaboration of doctors and scientists in Germany  with the Nazi political machine to rid their race of defective people (it  didn't seem to matter when impairment began or how, or these people were  educable and able to work). Not to ever dismiss the horror of the Jewish  Holocaust and the amount of lives taken, but it is imperative that we  remember and we teach that the slope leading to extermination of races  began with the ideas of Social Darwinism, natural selection, and survival  of the fittest, which were the scientific theories/beliefs used to justify  the removal of anyone with a difference. This belief system still pervades  society today, when someone like Kervorkian (who only worked with dead  bodies) could take it upon himself to decide whether someone's life was of  any worth, on the basis of 'normalcy'.<br />Henry Friedlander does an  excellent job of writing and researching into the lives and minds of the  doctors and administrators who ran the secret  programs that killed first,  German children who were born with disabilities, then led to the removal  from schools and homes of older children with disabilities to meet their  deaths through starvation and drugs, and finally to include adults with  disabilities in mass murders. It was on these people that the Nazis  perfected their instruments of genocide, and yet, even at Nurenburg their  suffering was dismissed as &quot;lives unworthy of life&quot; just because  of their disabilities.<br />This can happen again, especially with the  completion of the human genome. NO laws have been suggested to curtail the  use of information gleaned from the genome to prevent discrimination of any  kind against the disabled. It is of great concern that the disabled  community watch opponents of the Americans with Disabilities Act try to get  this civil rights act revoked as being expensive, especially since it  serves those who many (including Clint Eastwood apparently) feel are not  productive members of society. The slippery slope begins at this point, and  with these mindsets. <br />It is imperative that students of medicine and  students of science be made to read this book. It is only through education  and remembering the children and families whose lives were destroyed that  we can avoid allowing this Medical Holocaust from ever happening again.

People felt this way at the turn of the century, with the  discoveries of antibiotics which would 'totally' eradicate infectious  disease, with spaceflight and the Challenger, with AIDS, and now believe it  or not, the building up of coastal communities along the eastern seaboard  and Gulf Coast Seaboard. All of this in spite of the belief of scientists  and insurers that with global warming and changes in weather patterns these  areas are liable to be hit by frequent and large storms in the near  future.<br />This book was a perfect display of human fraility and their  ability to fool themselves. Larson did his research; I know because I  started doing research on the Internet after reading his book...and almost  all of what he said happened. There are plenty of first hand accounts  available on the Internet including the reports written by Issac and his  brother to the Weather Bureau and the idiotic replies and newspaper  announcements given out by the dummy in charge at that time. Yes, we can  only speculate what was going through their minds at that time, but many  journals and diaries were accessed, in which the participants put down  their thoughts and beliefs after the big event. At that time it was more  likely for people to record their heritage and keep journals because of  lack of television and radios, and the need to pass things on to the next  generation. I found this book and the writing to be almost flawless. Larson  writes with a journalistic bent, and if readers go to read the accounts of  the Johnstown Flood in Pa. they would find writing much the same. Some of  it is spectacular, but this storm was spectacular, and the stupidity and  arrogance involved even more so. It is an immensely readable and enjoyable  book, and I would recommend that the book be given to both contractors and  buyers of homes on the coastline prior to building!

Ms. Barr has an area pretty much all of her own in the mystery genre. She was a park ranger for the National Park system, and so not only can she concoct mysteries in an area that no one else has been able to do (the  parks are never the same twice) but she knows all about the people who work  for the system and unfortunately, some of the idiots who visit the parks  and don't obey the rules put up for their own safety.<br />She writes with a  great sense of humor. I am not squeamish, but running into an area where  ticks drop off the trees is not my idea of heaven either, and the picture  she drew of one of the male rangers gyrating to remove any ticks on him  made me laugh. It's nice to be reminded that women aren't the only ones  allergic to those things!<br />Her plots are well though out and the books  read quickly. They don't require a lot of thought from the readers. My only  wish is that the character development was more involved, but for some  people this isn't important. I always find it enjoyable to read about parks  where I haven't been and make plans with my husband to visit them someday.  She does do a good job giving some background of the park and the history  of the area. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-07-20

As someone who enjoys reading about forensic science, I had never read a book (nonfiction) or account by a coroner. Unfortunately, I live in Pittsburgh where we have the infamous Cyril Wecht to have to listen to or  read about constantly in our newspapers and on television. He is not the  best representative of this group of scientists, though at one point he  must have been a friend to Noguchi. Noguchi does a fairly good job of  explaining the work and some of the politics involved in running a forensic  lab for any large city. He could have written in much more detail then he  did for some of the stories, filled in the endings of the stories like with  Patty Hearst, and talked more about the work done with other groups such as  the FBI. I think he tries to be fair about giving credit where credit is  due, and I also feel like he wrote this book in answer to all of his many  critics who lied about his statements and abilities due to prejudice. Being  a native Californian and also a deaf person, I am fully aware of the  prejudices of that state and can sympathize with Dr. Noguchi. I plan on  reading his second book to see if his writing and coverage improves.  Otherwise, for those who aren't deeply involved or interested in this area  of science, this is a good introductory book. Karen Sadler, Science  Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-07-20

It is an excellent book for those interested in or going into neuroscience to read. Over the past ten years which were named the Decade of the Brain, there have been significant  arguments into whether the brain acts like a computer with parallel  processing, or whether it performs its functions in separate modules which  talk with other modules while doing so. Distributed processing and a  combination of all of these ideas is also being discussed or argued  depending on who is doing it at the Society for Neuroscience!<br />The point  is, while much has been learned about the brain, we still have a long way  to go. Restak is aware of this, and is very good about giving credit to  those in the past who made very educated guesses about what the brain and  mind consist of. Restak is another of our good science writers and his area  tends to stick with topics concerning the brain. I don't always agree with  his arguments, but he presents them well and of course, I am always  fascinated by the descriptions of the patients he has seen. I hope he  continues to write for us, and that a publisher will put this book out in  paperback for a new generation of up and coming neuroscientists and  educators to read. It is just as important for educators to know about the  brain as it is for doctors because they are the ones who help to wire or  rewire the brain, and they can either do great good, or great harm  depending upon their teaching methods and their attitudes towards others.

I know a few of these types at the University of Pittsburgh. In fact, I even tried to get into a lab where they were working with Drosophila (flies) and eyesight. They live in their own world, but the work that they  have done on genes will provide information on not only this one species,  but on humans as well. Mr. Weiner does an excellent job of portraiture with  words. The men who did all this work come out not just as scientists with  quirks, of which there are many, but also as men with passions about what  they are doing. Not all researchers have this passion, and that is why some  work in medical science is stagnating while other is leaping forward in  great bounds. I laughed when I recognized some of the stunts they pulled  and the innovations they made using simple ideas. Some of science is  serendipity, some is sheer perserverence, and some is creative thinking in  the simplest terms. This is what Jonathan Weiner wrote so well about in  this book.

I've been on the Appalachian Trail myself and recognize some of  the spots he talks about. I also recognize the people you meet,  and how  often people are very nice and patient when outdoors.

This book was on our shelves in my HIV lab as a student in neuroscience. I spotted it and pulled it out, and as I worked for two and a half years in this lab while finishing my Masters dissertation I would come up with  questions or things that had not been taught in my classes. This book  explained all of it quite nicely, and I am sure the updated version is even  better. There are enough pictures and graphs in this book to be helpful,  but a lot of the information cannot be provided in pictorial format. Too  many times in this field authors write for their peers, and not for  students or for understanding. This is not the  case with this book. It is  immensely accessible, and provides useful descriptions of both normal  cellular activities and what happens when disease hits, or autoimmunity  causes problems with the body's own defenses. It was extremely helpful in  allowing me to answer the questions of my dissertation committee, and I  recommend it to others who are working in various labs or have textbooks  that are poorly written.

I am extremely aware of how many people have written reviews of this book. This particular genre isn't in my areas of expertise, because I am a scientist and an educator, but this 'legal thriller' absolutely held my  attention to the point that I finished it in two days in spite of being in  school. Harr did a magnificent job of writing this incredible story, and it  was the first time I had been exposed to the moral questionability of all  of the groups involved (except the families who were hurt). Harr was fair  and made it clear that that Jan Schlictman was not a very nice person when  this case started. Typical of the generation I grew up in, money was the  name of the game for him and others. But as the case evolved and he came to  know the people who had been so devastated by the greed of the companies  who dumped their hazardous waste into the drinking water of this community,  Schlictman obviously became a changed man...and as both the book's ending  and the ending of the movie indicated, he may not be as wealthy as he once  was, but he is a better person and probably (I hope) happier. I keep  waiting for Harr or someone else to find a case as riveting as this one  was. Please, your audience is waiting with baited breath!

I've used this book or versions of it for a couple of years now...I've often been asked in regular science education classes or in neuroscience or biology situations, &quot;How do we make this stuff accessible to those  with disabilities?&quot; Thank heavens for all the tremendous work done by  this group and other innovative inventors who strive to put Deaf people  like me and those with learning, visual, and orthopedic disabilities on an  equal footing with everyone else. This book has more than served its  purpose and paid back its price many times over. Teachers and professors  are always amazed at the amount of work that is ongoing in this area, as  well as the amount of money out there for developing computer technology  for the disabled through the National Science Foundation, the Department of  Education, and the National Institute of Health, as well as individual  companies. <br />We will never make this country totally computer literate if  we exclude specific populations. As the push for inclusion of students with  disabilities in regular schools and acceptance of these students becomes  stronger, it is absolutely critical that teachers be aware of both hardware  and software that can make their curriula more accessible to both disabled  and 'normal' students. <br />I fully endorse and encourage teaching  universities and educators and librarians to make sure an updated version  of this book is made available so that all students have an opportunity to  achieve their highest abilities.

Normally, if I pick up a book which has too much language I find offensive, I don't waste my time on the book. As a professor at the University of Pittsburgh has on a sign on her door, &quot;Life is too short  to read bad books!&quot; I fully agree with this, and with the perhaps  archaic but valid view that those who have to depend on obscenities in  language often have very little else to say that is of any worth.<br />Having  said that, this book was otherwise one of the best surprises that I have  ever read. Mr. Thayer is an intelligent person who obviously did more than  his fair share of research for this book. The end came as a complete  surprise to me, since usually in less academic mysteries the reader can  figure out who-done-it...and this time I totally was convinced by the  author of another route. Nice trick. Proves to us educators/scientists we  don't know everything. <br />Other then the crudity of some of the language,  the author's plot, character development, and writing are impeccable. The  book also again brought to the fore the need this country has to recognize  the sacrifices made by the young men and women who served during the  Vietnam War. Korea may have been forgotten, but the Vietnam veterans were  ignored or despised, and we still have much to make up for that. <br />The  weather information and part of the plot was totally believable and  fascinating. I am hoping the author will do more with this idea in the  future, but not necessarily with the same characters.  Karen Sadler,  Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-07-13

This book really helped me through several classes and  has continued to be a great reference source for me. The graphics were  great...only complaint is that they aren't in color. But they still  provided me with plenty of information that sometimes the professors  neglected in class, but turned up on tests. Again, this is an excellent  book and resource.

This is one of several books I bought while in med school studying  neuroscience. This is a beautiful text, with wonderful drawings, good use  of catscans and MRIs, and an excellent layout. It helped me considerably to  learn the anatomy of the spinal cord and brain. Since I am deaf and they  couldn't deal with it in a classroom (looking down at microscopes does not  make lipreading easy or help my interpreters)...they sent me to the morgue  with medical students and nursing students. This book provided the  background I needed to do well in this situation, because the drawings were  explicit enough to be recognizeable when presented with the real thing. I  also use this book with deaf students who I hope to encourage to go into  science. The drawings always get them interested enough to ask questions,  and that is what good science is about.

Even though I thoroughly enjoyed the pictures, photographs, detail, and  lay out of the book...I think I expected more than what I actually got.  I've been interested in forensic science since medical school, and have  read quite a few books. This one was fun, but it became less interesting  and more preachy toward the end. I skimmed through the last part of the  book, especially on the author's concerns over whether the public was  adversely influenced by the OJ trial and the fiasco involved there. If I  remember rightly, it was more the stupidity of the LAPD rather than the  mistakes of the labs that stood out in everyone's mind. It is true that the  FBI lab has come under more fire lately for mistakes, as should other labs  if they do not do their job right. Lab work, whether for medical reasons or  criminalists, can literally mean life-or-death, and it would be foolish to  allow incompetence in either areas to flourish. <br />For those just beginning  to be interested in this field, especially those who think they may want to  do this as their life's work, this is a good book for them to read. Be  aware that the tests for DNA and other stuff is changing constantly, so  what was written in the book, will now have changed...the field of Northern  blotting, PCR, and other medical testing of blood components and DNA is  changing about every six months, with new technology and more accurate  methods of detection. It is difficult for any writer of this genre or  neuroscience textbooks even to keep up with the field. Karen Sadler,  Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-07-08

All med students learn about Jakob-Crutzfeld disease. Some learn about mad cow disease. A few interested in medical history learn about Kuru. Very few people realize that the three diseases/disorders are related, and guess  what? For a change of pace, we get them from what we eat...specifically  meat. I have to admit that the problems Britain was having with their  cattle had me worried more as a mother, than getting it myself. Just  because the young seemed to be getting the disease more then the elderly.  That tracked down to the fact they were either working directly with  infected cattle or frequenting McDonalds. Since my family does neither, I  am not so worried as to become a vegetarian, though this book gives room  for that thought!<br />Mr. Rhodes wrote a Pulitzer Prize winner on the Atomic  bomb which I read. I didn't even realize it was the same author. This book  while very well written for viral science, is not on par with his other  book. I enjoyed this book very much though, and anyone who is fascinated by  the small things that are 'out' to get us and the history of medical  mysteries, would thoroughly enjoy this book. Rhodes makes it clear that he  admires the people who research and spend time with those in New Guinea,  and who out of the goodness of their hearts spent years educating an  isolated people whose demise from this disease probably would have had very  little impact on the world at large. Yet these men place an importance on  each culture, and tried to respect cultural boundaries and avoid polluting  their societies with ours while teaching them how to avoid this problem  Kuru. I enjoyed that story of cultural respect more than anything.  I am  sure we will be hearing more about this particular killer as time goes on,  because the answer to its riddle hasn't been found yet, and we still don't  know what the final outcome of the disaster in Britain is going to be. I  hope  a few ranchers will bother to read this and avoid feeding their  cattle and sheep offal and other parts of dead animals. That alone could  prevent the US from undergoing what Britain has had to endure...and we eat  a lot more meat then they do!

First off being a native Californian and also having been in Oregon quite  a bit, the author tends to take the stereotyping a bit too far. Not all  Oregonians are anti-anyone else, nor are they all New Agists. To an extent,  the stereotyping detracts from the book and the plot which is actually very  good. Maybe with future novels the author can avoid this. The book is very  funny especially toward the end which wasn't expected. The author even made  puns out of the title...once was enough. For the most part the book is  intelligent and a fun read, but there were so many characters to keep track  of that at certain points I would forget the relationship between the  different residents of the town. Anyway, I enjoyed reading this mystery for  the most part. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-07-07

For books which are read for enjoyment and entertainment, that should not be the case. I've read her books before, and usually they are more tightly written, concise, with a  plausible plot. This was not the case in this book, and it felt as  though  the inclusion of different family members was merely done as afterthoughts  to connect to previous books. Very disconnected job...

Boy, if I had any say in what they should require as reading for students in neuroscience, I would definitely put this book up there right along with any textbooks. This book, as usual for Dr. Sacks, puts a human face on  neurological injury or trauma, so that everyone can understand. Unlike many  doctors, Dr. Sacks sees not only the diagnositic testing, but the person  inside who has to learn to adapt to their disability to survive. Each of  these stories are poignant, and as a Deaf person who underwent a cochlear  implant which failed, I found his story about the blind man Virgil, who  became sighted (somewhat) and then lost his sight again, hitting very close  to home. I actually borrowed this book from the library, but I am planning  to buy it at first chance because there are so many intelligent quotes in  this book, that I have already used in my own writings and plan to use it  in teaching students.<br />Dr. Sacks is one of the most intelligent medical  writers we have today, and I for one am profoundly grateful he decided to  write books on neurology. I wish that I had been exposed to his books  earlier when I was in medical school for neuroscience. These stories about  the people make neurology real and made neurological concepts  understandable. It is not the research, the neurophysiology, the diagnostic  testing which is so important, though they have their place in medical  school: it is the fact that the people who have autism or who undergo  strokes can teach us so much about ourselves, and many of them have  surmounted huge obstacles to make something of their lives. It is all too  easy in medical school, and in education to forget this. If you buy only  one book on neuroscience this year, this should be the book. It is  magnificent.

I absolutely detest English grammar. Having said that, be forewarned I am Deaf...that explains everything. I had to take English grammar in different formats in 3 classes. Third time around I got smart and started looking for  some other help then the recommended textbooks. This book I found on my  own, and this is the book on the shelf above my head when I am writing. It  is small, concise, helps with things that spell and grammar checks on  software won't or can't do. It is inexpensive, so this is the one I  recommend to friends and students.

In graduate school for Neuroscience I had to take a class on molecular biology and biochemistry which was required of all med students whether Ph.D. or M.D. or both. We had five different teachers in the class, three  of whom were foreign. Since I was the first Deaf person to take  Neuroscience there, they weren't prepared for me...and I ended up taking  the class without interpreters! I had to lipread the teachers. If it hadn't  been for this particular textbook, I would never had made it through! I am  not kidding anyone by saying this. YOu can take a class with just this  textbook for information and still pass with flying colors. That is how  well this text is written. For once, the book was written with the student  in mind, not the peers of the authors. It was written to teach the same  information that the authors had in such a way as to make it  understandable. Not only did I use this text in this class but in most of  my classes at med school. When I started working on HIV encephalitis in my  chosen lab for two years, I was not surprised to find this book on the  shelves...and we all referred to it constantly. I applaud the authors for a  job well done, and if I ever write a textbook, this will be the one I use  to follow as an appropriate way to write curriculum. The amount of pictures  and graphs were especially great for teaching Deaf students and I intend to  use it for such.  Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-07-01

I really hate to write detrimental things about books I do not like, but this is a required book in some class at my University...and frankly, I don't know why. To be honest, I think part of it was the way the book was  used in the classroom, and how the professors made us jump from one topic  to another without gaining a full understanding of the first one! Just in  case someone thinks I am just a student who could not hack the topic, my BS  and MS are in Neuroscience, and I took statistics twice before this...once  in neurostatistics and once in epidemiology. Try and read some of the  journals in Neuroscience some time...Believe me they are much worse, or  should be much worse then a social science document such as this.<br />I  object to authors who write to impress their peers rather than write to  explain their topic areas in such a way so that a student coming from  another field can begin to understand what is going on fairly soon after  reading the textbook, or parts of the textbook. I really do not care if the  audience the authors/author are trying to reach are college students or  graduate students, if the writing is such that the material does not make  sense without total explanations from the teacher, then something is wrong.  Most of the fifty some odd people in both classes who I talked to about it  agreed that both the book and the classes were boring, unstimulating, and  that they were having a difficult time comprehending the material  presented. Since most of these people were and are teachers or those who  work in educational research, it obviously wasn't me or them. I think the  idea is supposed to be to make curricula accessible to all students. Since  I am a Deaf person, and have had my fill of professors who definitely did  not try to make their classes accessible, I tend to hold the writers of  textbooks up to a high standard. None of the students in the class were  'learning-disabled' but this book did an awfully good job of making feel asif we were. All of us tried to sell this book back rather than keep it in  our shelves which at a graduate level is unusual, but because they are  bring a new edition out the books were unresaleable. I am looking for a  more coherent text for my own personal use on education assessment...it  won't be this one. Karen Sadler,  Science Education, University of  Pittsburgh	2000-06-23

This was a new author for me, but caught my eye with its topic on academia. Since I am stuck in that world (kidding) myself, and know of the foibles of this world with the grant writing, the little secrets, the  gossiping from which luckily I am exempt since I am deaf (but I  &quot;hear&quot; third or fourth hand, literally by hand), I got a big kick  out of the characters Ms. Dobson has written about. This is a deeply  intelligent mystery without the need to be offensive as I find some writers  are. I kept hoping and keep hoping that none of this about Emily Dickinson  is true, since I love her poetry. But this was a truly satisfying mystery  in plot, in characterization, and in explaining the whys and wherefores of  a world many don't know about.

Unfortunately, like most other topics by these researchers  information on how to correct those misconceptions rarely makes it down to  the teachers level. This is a book which is intended to help teachers at  all grades help to correct any misunderstandings they may have encountered.  Since learning is for a life-time and not just for children, this book is  actually good for adult education and inclusive education of those with  disabilities. It makes things that teachers may not have had an opportunity  in college to study extremely clear, and gives exercises which will clear  up misunderstandings totally for most students. It is a valuable addition  to my bookshelves and I recommend it to students who will be teachers in  the future. Karen Sadler, Science education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-06-22

This book is and was intended for use by linguists, educators, and others such as anthropologists who were in the 1970's and the 1980's beginning to realize that ASL was not a manual gesture system mimicing English, but  rather a language in its own right. Dr. Bellugi and Dr. Klima have been  working on exploring this language for the past 30 years, both in studying  native signers (the prelingually deafened of deaf parents) and also in  studying aphasics in the deaf community in comparison to aphasics in the  hearing community. This particular book sticks mostly with elucidating the  grammar, the lexicon, the syntax, and all the other components which make  up ASL.<br />As a Deaf person whose first language was English, and who was  required in college to take a foreign language I had to, of course, learn  ASL. I started using ASL when I totally lost my hearing to get information  in my classes which I couldn't get through lipreading. As I progressed in  Neuroscience and Science education for my Ph.D. I found that I needed to  know more about ASL and the grammar and syntax of it. This particular book  was required for one of my classes studying English versus ASL grammar.  Because the book is so heavy duty, I did not read enough for the book or  language to make sense. It wasn't until I read the book over summer  vacation, very slowly, that I gleaned the vital information which I needed  as both an educator and a neuroscientist.<br />This is not an easy book to  read. Many of the best books never are. This is not to say that the authors  did not try to make the information accessible. They did, but the topic is  very confounding. I recommend this book for anyone sincerely interested in  learning accurately about ASL, no matter what their field, but with the  warning to give yourself time to assimulate the information, and read the  book. I personally would not require reading the book partially for a  class, because it is only in starting from the beginning and going to the  end that you can view the language as a whole. This is a book that should  be used and read over a period of two semesters, with a lot of discussion.  Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-06-21

This is one of the most accessible science books on my shelves. Since I am always on the look-out for science books which have as much visual content such as photos, pictures, graphs, etc. for my Deaf students, as they do  written language...this book was perfect. For regular teachers who are  looking for books that can be used in inclusive classrooms, this is  definitely a winner. Luckily the type is extremely large, so with the new  technology coming out which allows a visually impaired person to either use  a mouse with a camera, or a 'reader' to also access this book. I wish more  companies and educational/science books would use this format...we wouldn't  be having such a difficult time in inclusive classrooms if they did. As an  adult and a neuroscientist too, I thoroughly enjoyed going back and  relearning things I had forgotten, or things such as astronomy I just  hadn't been taught. Cudos to the author and National Geographic once  again!  Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-06-21

The last one I enjoyed, and though I do enjoy the time and effort put into the background for the story based in Ireland, the book ended up being extremely confusing. I  finished it, but didn't find it as well written as the book I had read of  hers before. The reason for the presence of the major character being in  Ireland was a bit contrived, and the 'clues' were very strained and never  seem to come together in any way. It's fine to want to teach more about  another country, but this genre is not the way to do it, unless you are  will to put a great deal of effort into the background and explanations. I  am not sure I will be reading any other books from this particular author  in the future because my time is limited for 'fun' books when I have  educational/medical books I have to read for my work. When I read something  different to get my mind off of my daily work, I still want it to be  well-done. This book wasn't. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of  Pittsburgh	2000-06-19

Very rarely do I not return books for cash if it  isn't in my direct field or interests, but this was one textbook I plan on  keeping. Dr. Gordis made a unknown subject for a deaf student not only  fascinating but understandable...especially with all the statistics  involved! I luckily had great teachers too, but part of their greatness had  to do with finding the best textbook to require in their classroom. I refer  back to this text constantly when writing about epidemics in the Deaf  community.

When I was taking classes to get a Ph.D. in Science Education, I had to take a class in which we were asked to find a book on curriculum (science) and analyze it and how well it was done. Since my BS and MS are in  Neuroscience, and my concerns lie in educating Deaf students in science and  medical literacy, I picked this book. It was and is being used for students  who will be teach physical education. Now I really disagree on this matter,  that ill-trained physical education teachers should be teaching such an  important subject matter as health. It should be encorporated into biology,  but that is neither here nor there concerning this particular book. I was  very impressed with the work, with the ideas, and with the effort the  authors made in this health book to make health education inclusive in its  aims. Not only did they try to reach all students regardless of gender,  race, and ability...but they taught specific lessons on disabilities which  would explain and answer questions that some students may have concerning  classmates/peers who have those disabilities. This book is five years old  and needs to be updated in areas such as AIDS and Hepatitis C. Things have  changed drastically in both these areas which have not been touched on in  the book. However, their ideas and lessons were of the quality that I could  make slight adjustments to the curricula to make it more accessible say to  deaf or blind students, without having to teach them away from the rest of  the class. I highly recommend this book to all teachers who are interested  in protecting the health of the children/students they teach. Karen Sadler,  Science Education, University of Pittsburgh	2000-06-16

It has been thirty years since the coining of and implementation of 'special education' for children and students with disabilities. In spite of all this time, the research into special education tends to stick to the  social values of educating children with disabilities with their  &quot;normal&quot; peers in public schools. Most of this research has been  made in disabilities such as orthopedic, mental retardation, and learning  disabilities of all kinds.<br />Claire Ramsey is one of the first educational  researchers to go into normal public schools with children who are either  deaf or have severe to profound hearing losses. She spent time with the  regular teachers, the special educators, the children, the interpreters for  these children, and others who were involved in trying to give an education  to these students. She fully explores the impact of inclusive education for  students of this nature, and comes to conclusions that have been wondered  about, but never written about or researched to the point of  conclusions.<br />Like me, Ramsey sees the ultimate lesson to be learned is  that the most important part of schooling should be giving every child,  including deaf or hearing impaired ones, an education. This is in contrast  to the social do-gooders who are not disabled who see public schooling as a  social leveling device. For all their good intentions, these people only  want to teach those who are 'normal' to be tolerant of those with  disabilities. Unfortunately, this tolerance will not help the deaf and  disabled get a job, make informed decisions about their lifestyles and  health care, or allow them to progress in society. Only education does  that...and Ms. Ramsey does a good first job in bringing this information to  the educators of educators. Karen Sadler Science Education, University of  Pittsburgh	2000-06-16

Radetsky did fantastic job with the history of viral research, on the  mainly men who worked on finding these invisible 'monsters' who can wreck  such havoc on the human race. The book reads quickly and well, and it  follows a chronological pattern that allows the reader to understand what  had to happen before to allow certain discoveries to occur.

This was the first medical dictionary I got while in medical school. Since I was in there for Neuroscience and not to get an MD. perhaps my area of speciality was too limited for those who would usually use this dictionary.  It was extremely frustrating to look up things such as encephalocele and  find either no information or very little information. I decided that as a  dictionary of medical terminology, books such as this cannot be limited to  the concise words given in other dictionaries. There were too many times I  was reading or writing medical papers in which I had to put this particular  version down and look up the information I needed either at school or on  the Internet. When you are in a hurry, you don't have time to do either of  those things and prefer to have something you can just flip open  alphabetically and get the answer you were looking for.

This book is one of my standards in my bookshelf for students and those of my friends who express an interest in the changing balance of the microbial world. As per usual, we humans tend to dismiss what we cannot see. Laurie  Garrett does a fine job of dragging our attention to a world which exists  with us and against us, depending upon how we treat the world and our own  bodies. Ms. Garrett writes well, and introduces a heavy topic that is  usually written about by virology professors, and in such a manner as to  totally bypass the layperson, and most of their students as well. The  author of this book makes this information accessible to everyone which is  not an easy task and she also does a wonderful job portraying those  courageous men and women who search the world for emerging viruses, and  work so hard to find a way to control them. <br />This is not a book for the  faint-of-heart, yet it is a book which should be read by as many people as  possible, for their own information and for teaching our children and  grandchildren respect for this earth and for the diversity of life on this  earth.

This  particular manual impressed me right off the bat, and after viewing it in  comparison to others a few more times, I bought it. I have never regretted  it, both as a student, writer, and a parent.

I may be great in science and education, but I still have problems with mathematics. The Code Book is a historical book with a mathematical bent, in which the author goes out of his way to make sure the reader understands  what he is talking about. It piqued my interest to see that this particular  book did not confine itself to the twentieth century, but rather searched  for the development of codes as civilization and military intrigue demanded  them. It was always a little surprising to find out why some codes are so  easily understood by some people, and yet others with good backgrounds  could not see the key, even if it was dangling right in front of them. Not  only is the history of code-work interesting, but the type of people  involved in development or breakdown of codes. It seemed like you could  almost profile the type of persons who were going to be successful at this  type of stuff. For a book that is way out of my field, this was really  interesting and enjoyable. Anyone who loves a good puzzle, crossword, or  mystery would enjoy this book, and I highly recommend it!

This was my first introduction to Mr. Bernhardt's books, so I can't claim that any before were better than this one. He does a good job introducing the ongoing conflict between environmentalists and those whose livelihoods  would be affected by sanctions. As is usual, both sides act out of emotion,  and refuse to see the other side's point of view. This is a constant theme  yet it rarely ends in murder. Accidents yes, but outright murder, no. It  obviously would be all to easy for another group to take advantage of this  situation and use it to their own advantage. Bernhardt does a good job of  writing about the people involved, though characterization takes a back  seat to the plot in this case. Maybe he has set up the characters in  previous books which I need to go back and read, and believe me I will!  Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh, klsst23@pitt.edu	2000-06-02

We have now entered a second time of deep concern for the science, math, and technological education for everyone. The first one occurred after the Sputnik fiasco, when the Russians beat us in the race to reach space. The  concern now has risen due to what science groups such as the American  Association for the Advancement of Science, and educators saw in comparison  of assessments made of students in the U.S. and those in other developed  countries, such as Japan. The answer to this concern was for the AAAS along  with other groups to put out a guideline as to what constitutes scientific  literacy, and what the public in the U.S. should at least know to be  scientifically literate. As usual, though the AAAS addressed the fact that  certain groups in the U.S. were not being 'included' in the pursuit of  science literacy, such as women and racial minorities, in this their first  book they skipped over those of us with disabilities. Since this is a major  concern of mine and the area in which I do research, I was appalled to see  they neglected 'us' once again, especially as the AAAS has a separate  department dealing with the Disabled/Deaf.  In spite of this mistake, the  writing of this book has laid the groundwork for universities and colleges  as to what the teachers they train should know and be able to teach so that  our country can be more scientifically literate. With new information being  made available through newspapers and the Internet on a daily basis, it is  absolutely imperative that all adults regardless of race, gender, or  ability be able to glean the information they need from this outpouring of  information to make decisions requiring informed consent in health care,  decisions on employment (since health care is one of the top employers in  the U.S. today), and to teach their children. This book was the beginning,  but it isn't the end. More books have further elucidated what is required  for science literacy from both the AAAS and other sciencegroups. This is  the place to start if you are an educator of any kind who wants their  students to become scientifically literate.

The University of Pittsburgh Neuroscience department uses this book as one of it's main textbooks. It is an interesting book, and one that I've used for years. This edition is in keeping with the other editions of the book,  meaning, it is just as disorganized by chapters and topics as it always  was. Even though many of the individual chapters are well-written and  interesting, I get the feeling the whole thing was thrown together as fast  as they could get it out. Many times when I am looking up information, I  can't even go to a specific chapter and be sure I'll find it there...I have  to use the index in the back of the book. That is okay, but it is  time-consuming and I think that students and educators would be better  served if the book were more carefully organized. It should be remembered  that writing a book for Neuroscience is difficult at best, because the  information changes at least every three months...so by the time a textbook  gets to print, some of what they have said is already out of date.

It is a good book with some well-written and well-addressed ideas on implementation of science literacy. Some chapters are better than others in addressing the  topics raised. An example is the first chapter is about Equity in Science  Education. This time the AAAS did include the disabled/deaf in their  concern about equity. Yet the chapter concerned itself mostly with women  and racial minorities. In fact, if you look at the references in the back  of the chapter, you can see that the AAAS didn't know quite what to do or  say about disabled students in classrooms, just that someone needed to make  science more equitable. There were 40+ references for women, 70+ references  concerned with racial minorities, and only 14 references concerning people  with disabilities (and most of these were concerned with learning  disabilities). This left the chapter lopsided, and certainly did not give  any useful information for special or regular educators who are looking for  assistance in how to teach science and math to students with disabilities  who are in their regular classrooms. With the push for inclusion (a social,  not educational movement), the AAAS needs to address equity for these  students. They have yet to do so, and still, they have their own resource  directory of scientists and engineers with disabilities. The question is  why they didn't ask them to become involved in this chapter and others  which affect those with disabilities trying to make it in science? This  book has its uses, but has many faults and exclusions which need to be  addressed again by the AAAS. It is my hope as a Deaf scientist and educator  that they will rethink their chapters to give more useable ideas, make it  more equitable, and spout less rhetoric in future publications.

Since the push for inclusion means many students with disabilities are entering regular schools and classrooms with their peers, it is of great worth that the regular teacher as well as the special education teachers know the background of the laws that pertain  to these students with diverse needs. It would be beneficial to both  students, teachers, and parents to know and understand how the laws are  applied in court, what an IEP is, what is expected of the teachers, and  what can be expected of the students. I have the other major law books on  disability laws, but this one is more geared toward other participants in  the process besides lawyers. It is very readable and very understandable  without having to go to law school to get a background in law first. I  suggest this or rather recommend this to my friends and students who are  interested in working with those with disabilities in regular school  settings.

My introduction to the wonderful world of viruses came first hand. I am deaf probably due to rubella and/or mumps, and my great-grandmother died in 1918 during the time period in question for the 1918 influenza epidemic.  However, since she had been placed in an asylum/poorhouse because she was a  grand mal epileptic, her death certificate didn't mention the flu...but the  family has always wondered.  Kolata does a reasonably good job with an area  of expertise which can often be confusing and the usual assortment of  suspects who write about virology manage to do it in such a manner as to  turn people off of such a scientific morass. Kolata makes her topic  interesting and understandable and brings the reader up to date on current  ideas and theories concerning what set the world up for being hit by such a  devastating disease. She may not have the training in virology, but the  author does a good job in presenting her information. I would have like  more personal stories included in this book but on the whole I thought the  book was well-written.

Everyone knows how easy it is to find things on the Internet nowdays like how to make a bomb. Obviously this is a big problem since we have so many young men using the Net as a means to hurt others. The authors of this book  put in a little blurb in the forward that they changed things around so as  not to provide the wackos out there with the means of doing the kind of  seriously scary things that the 'bad' person in this story was pulling off.  Unfortunately, it wouldn't take much for someone to read this book and  correct the sometimes obvious mistakes they made to cover their tracks...it  is all too easily available on the Net now. I enjoy books by those who have  some idea of what they are talking about, but I always worry that they will  give someone who is on the verge of psychological illness the push he/she  needs to take their perceived problems to the next step.  Like a couple of  other reviewers, I noticed some inconsistencies in the writing...which I  wasn't sure if that was bad proofreading, or done on purpose to throw  someone off. The plot was great and plausible, character development needed  work, and the inconsistencies should have been spotted before printing.  Since this was a first book, and there is obviously going to be a  sequel...maybe they can fix these problems before they get to the next one.

It never surprises me when I find a book or a topic that I like and it is by this particular author. Mr. McCullough is today's best  writer on history and biographies. His book on Truman and opened doors of  understanding for me on how politics worked then, and probably continue to  work. He writes with knowledge of the personal problems this man had to  face in being an ultimately honest and fair person, but one who had to  learn how to work within the confines of politics without losing his good  qualities. Mr. McCullough also brings to the book an understanding about  how many time Harry Truman was placed in situations beyond his control, or  was ignored and humiliated because other  people assumed he was a hick.  FDR's snobbishness towards Truman is not a surprise, I read about it when  reading about Los Alamos and the making of the Atom Bomb, but McCullough  makes sure we know exactly how bad it was. I almost felt like crying for  Truman when people behaved this way towards him and his family, and I am a  Republican. This book sincerely made me wish not for a past period of  history, but rather for more men and women who prized honesty and integrity  beyond the glories of the world. I would wish for people not to  underestimate those who choose to keep their lives simple and good, who  place their family high on their list of priorities, and who aren't afraid  to say what they think in an intelligent manner. This is all of what Truman  was, in spite of his faults. Mr. McCullough did an outstanding job of  writing in this biography! Karen L.

Unlike most science writers,  Preston makes sure you understand the human and nonhuman results of our  carelessness with our environment. This is not a dry textbook...I've read  those in Neuroscience. This book scared the daylights out of me and though  I don't recommend it to anyone who is a hypochondriac, I do recommend it  for anyone else. It is only through science literacy and medical literacy  of the public that we can possibly hope of preventing serious outbreaks  that put all of us at risk. All it takes is one stupid animal handler  forgetting to wear protective gloves, or a hotel neglecting to keep its  vents clean because they don't want to spend the money, or turning our  heads the other way when druggies who have TB don't take their full course  of medicine.

She and Ms. Colker do a good job of putting this law book together. I  notice in the University bookstore...they don't often get this book back  and have to buy more (I work there while getting my PhD). We didn't get the  time to do the whole book in class and actually Disability Law should take  more than one semester, especially if lawyers are planning on entering this  speciality.

We seem to be getting quite a few of these  types of mysteries which are  set in the late 1800's in large cities; one author write about my hometown,  Pittsburgh, another writes about San Francisco.

I found this book while browsing one day. It's subtitle is Students with Disabilities and Standards-based Reform. In the midst of the outcry from politicians and parents for reform of the public school system, one group  has been steadfastly ignored. That is those who have disabilities. For  example, the American Association for the Advancement of Science put out a  book in 1990 called Science for All Americans...Project 2061. This book  stressed many of the much needed reforms concerning science literacy, but  in their forward they mentioned every neglected group EXCEPT the disabled.  Now since then, the AAAS has changed their lists of neglected groups to  include the disabled, but a friend at the National Science Foundation who  is blind, said that he went to a Congressional Meeting on school reform and  especially science reform, and once again Congress neglected to mention  including the disabled. As a Deaf person who struggled with bad attitudes  of teachers and professors, interpreters with no training in science,  outright illegal behavior on the part of two Universities, and being active  in accessiblity and discrimination groups, I know how hard it is going to  be to get the reforms and the eductional society together in such a way to  make them work together. This book is a good first step towards that goal.  The National Research Council has done its statistical work on just how  many disabled drop out of school and are unemployed, due directly to  educators who ignore them at best and have no intention of including those  with disabilities in this march for better educational systems in the U.S.  What neither Congress or educators seem to understand is that the impact of  education which is below par and doesn't include the disabled in the  reforms will ultimately be paid for by the American public. The disabled  want to work, want to be part of society, and want to be accepted for who  they are, not for what educators think they should become (ie., Deafturning into English speakers). We also want the chance to choose for  ourselves the right to make decisions as to what we want to spend our  lifetime doing. For all educators, this book is a must-read since the  inclusion movement is gaining momentum, and regular teachers are going to  see us, the disabled, in their classes, and in regular universities.  Neither we or the Americans with Disabilities Act is going away, and  educators better be prepared for dealing with diverse students in their  classes. This book will help them achieve that goal.

This little green book is a definite must-have addition to any neuroscientist, educator, or anyone interested in the brain. Restak is a  good writer, and not only weaves his words well, but uses the writings of  others outside the field to make understanding the complicated workings of  the  brain understandable to someone who is just being introduced to it.  I've used this particular book in several papers on deafness and cognition,  and every once in a while I pick it up and reread parts of it (usually that  I marked) that bear remembering. Certainly Restak is a remarkable writer,  and thus probably a remarkable teacher. I wish I had had someone like him  in Neuroscience...it would have helped tremendously to have someone so in  love with his topic that he wants everyone to understand it. We need more  science teachers and science writers like him to encourage young people to  consider science as a possible career. And perhaps maybe if more people  understood the brain, they would quit treating their own brains without  regard to the damage they are doing to it by using drugs and alcohol, or  misusing prescription drugs.

I find it hard to believe sometimes that Stephen Pinker teaches at MIT. You mean some scientists do actually have a sense of humor? Anyone who reads this book had better have a great sense of humor, a love of the  absurd, and a desire to really understand language. I'm in Science  Education, not linguistics, but because I am deaf and studying how deaf  people learn, it ends up with a lot of linguistic study in it. Usually the  books from this lot of scientists are mind-boggling hard to get through,  but not Mr. Pinker. If he teaches like he writes, then he must be a heck of  a teacher! Mr. Pinker is also one of the few linguists who aren't devoted  to ASL studies who includes information about American Sign Language that  makes it clear that it is a real language in its own right. That alone  would endear Dr. Pinker to the Deaf culture. This books takes all those  difficult concepts concerning the innateness of language, and conveys them  to the layman in an easy-to-understand way. He is never patronizing and  always funny. I enjoy reading the book, which I often have to do since I  use it in my papers a lot. To say Dr. Pinker's book is brilliant is a  statement of fact.

The two  things that stand out in this book are 1) that such genius and madness can  exist together, and 2) that they are still collecting oddball words from  here and England and throughout the world which are English-based words.  Shortly after finishing this book, I was working in the bookstore and saw  an advertisement from the company that does the Oxford Dictionary asking  Americans to send in new or different words, along with the variety of  meanings.

I usually enjoy the no-brainer historical mystery which Anne Perry is one of the better writers. She has built some believeable characters with plots and twists that are believeable from the Victorian Era in England. In this  book though, like many shows such as MASH that have been on TV too long,  she is less concern about her characters and her plots then presenting her  own philosophy about pornography. Not that I disagree with her, but this  book was difficult to read because there were two different storylines, one  extremely preachy, and one that was the basis for the mystery, yet was not  built up properly. I hate to go back and forth between plots, and though  she ties them up at the end, it didn't satisfy me or what I expect of her  as a writer. Maybe it is like other people have written about characters or  series which have gone on too long, the author is more concerned with  meeting a deadline, then developing plot and character. I may go back and  read some of her older books that I have not yet read, but I am not sure I  will pick up any future ones. It becomes a waste of the reader's time.

Not only were three articles in it exactly what  my committee had talked about, but Dr. Oaks gave references with the  articles and arranged them in such a way as to be very accessible. He  managed to find important articles from diverse sources (the one on ASL was  from the Smithsonian magazine which I already had and which has been one of  the better articles written for the layman about ASL over the last few  years). I am holding onto this book and recommending it to some of my  education teachers to use in their classes. I know I will be using it in  mine, and quoting from it for years to come. Thank you Dr. Oaks, for such a  well-done textbook (which is hard to find in college!) Karen Sadler,  Science education, University of Pittsburgh, klsst23@pitt.edu	2000-05-19

She is a sharp woman with great writing skills, and her knowledge of forensic science is certainly part of the reason people come back to read her again and again. This book was extremely depressing, more than frightening...because we've been through these same things with Scarpetta and her niece before. How many times can one person deal with such tragedy and loss in their lives. At a certain point, this becomes unbelieveable (except for the Kennedy family), and the reader loses interest. Yes, the author is aging her protagonist and life does change, but must it always be so negative? I get the feeling Cornwell wants to be rid of this character, with this book being not up to her usual standards and with the introduction of other characters in books such as &quot;Southern Cross&quot;. If this is true then I should think the author would want this character to go out with a good plot behind her. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh, klsst23@pitt.edu	2000-05-19

I've read many of Jeffrey Deaver's books in spite of the fact Itend to stay away from those books whose authors insist on using a lotof swearing (yeah I know corny and at odds with the rest of the world). However, Deaver writes so well, I tend to overlook his use of foul language. The Devil's Teardrop was his cleanest to date, and though his other books are great, I found myself drawn to this particular character/protagonist because he was a family man who tried to put his family first. In this cynical day and age, it is rare to find that in books. The plot was excellent, especially for those of us who are aware of the kind of damage the brain can do peripherally. I enjoyed learning more about forensic writing, and I hope Deaver chooses to use this character in other stories. Karen L.

I've had this book since they first printed it. It is definitely one of my favorite all time books. I sometimes have to go back like once a year and read it all over again. I drove my husband nuts with it, because he isn't  as much of a reader as I am and so I would start reading some of the quotes  from it. Since he is a humorist himself he enjoyed the smart alecky  comments that many of these classical curmudgeons either wrote or said, and  still managed to get away with it. What is so astounding is that many of  the humorous sayings still make sense today, out of context. Winokur did  some decent research on these people and provided some information into why  these people had such acid tongues. But he doesn't overdo it, but rather  leaves the quotations to speak for themselves. A good late night giggler of  a book! Karen L. Sadler.

I have quite a collection of ASL dictionaries, because I am deaf but didn't learn ASL until later in life. Now I am in science education, and I still need the dictionaries to write about the differences in ASL and  English when translating science curricula. This is the best dictionary on  the market today. The author used the format they use for most other  dictionaries when going from English to that language and back. Only in  ASLs case instead of written words as the phonemes or morphemes, you have  handshapes. As the other reviewer stated, with this dictionary you can go  from English to ASL, and deaf people can go from known handshapes to the  most representative English word. Up til this point there was no dictionary  for the Deaf to use to refer back to the English words. This is also the  only format where you don't have to go hunting through the book for what  you are looking for. Like all written mediums for dictionaries and ASL its  only problem is its two dimensional presentation. However, the work they  put into finally making a dictionary in the right way for ASL far outweighs  the two dimensional concern. As an educator, this is the book I recommend  and use for my classes and for my papers. Karen L. Sadler, Science  Education, University of Pittsburgh, klsst23@pitt.edu	2000-05-17

Most people tend to think that only Germany was capable of doing the atrocities that occurred during WWII. It was these  atrocities that led to the Nuremburg Code of conduct for physicians and  scientists, yet it was known prior to the Germans butchery that other  countries including the US and England were equally responsible for using  human beings for questionable experiments. As a student in medical school I  came across references to this book and others like it. My interest lay in  the fact that as a Deaf person, I know what it is like to have doctors  treat me with disrespect and patronizingly. I started researching into how  lack of education leads to people being taken advantage of by the medical  establishment. In my research, so many referred back to this particular  book, I decided I just had to read it. Not only have I read it but I have  lent it to others who share my concern that there are medical practitioners  out there like Kervorkian who would have no problem putting to death or  using for unethical experiments, people who they view as less than people.  Jones did a magnificent job of research and follow-up with those involved  in this horrible fiasco. Not only were these doctors racist, but they  considered anyone with lower education to be only as useful as animals...to  an extent they treated these men with less care and concern then they treat  animals used in experiments today. Jones was more than fair, including  reasons for why these doctors and nurses, both black and white, did not  perceive this long on-going experiment as being wrong. It is partially due  to his exposure of this experiment, that other minority groups including  the disabled are looking carefully at the medical establishment for bias  and prejudice, for neglect and outright denial of fair medical treatment  and availability of treatment. Every medical student, public health  student, science student, educator, and frankly everyone should read this  book. I am deeply concerned that if we don't pay attention to the ethics of  all the new science and medical information being found, we will once again  allow someone somewhere in our nation the opportunity to use a particular  group of people for their own unethical purposes. We cannot afford to turn  a 'blind' eye to this happening again. Karen L. Sadler, Science Education,  University of Pittsburgh, klsst23@pitt.edu	2000-05-17

This is an older version of this particular ASL dictionary. Perhaps some things have changed in his newer versions. I was required to take ASL though Deaf in college as my foreign language requirement. Though I had  been exposed to ASL before, English is my first language. Since then, I've  collected many books on the Deaf and also ASL books that interested me.  This one proved to be much better than the ones that were used in my  classes. It is easy to carry, and provides a large amount of signs for a  book. The problems with teaching ASL using a book is that it is two  dimensional, rather than 3 dimensional. I recommend this book for  beginners, but if you are serious about learning the syntax and grammar of  ASL it is better to get a CD ROM or take advantage of web sites which show  ASL in video streaming. It is even more important to get involved with the  Deaf community, because a book cannot tell you how the community uses its  language. Karen L.

I read mysteries as a way to relax in between all the serious writing and reading I do for science education for the Deaf community. So it was with great joy that I found these little gems by Penny Warner. She writes about  a Deaf woman who runs a newspaper. Now first off, this is unheard  of--pardon the pun, for a Deaf person to be perceived as having the  intelligence to do something other than menial work. And it is with, I  think, a slyness on Ms. Warner's part that she makes her heroine the owner  and editor of an American English newspaper. Ms. Warner knows of what she  is talking about. She isn't Deaf but has worked with them for years. So  these books start out with a big difference. It is becoming more acceptable  to have disabled people out and in the open, such as on Sesame Street and  in other characters such as Jeffrey Deaver's Lincoln Rime (sic).  Popularizing people with differences helps those of us who are trying to  make it in the 'normal' world, and we appreciate it!

I am always on the lookout  for good quality books which provide simple but concise descriptions of the  brain's capacities and the impact of drugs, alcohol, and injuries on the  brain. Kotulak does a pretty good job, and actually provided me with some  interesting information which wasn't available in textbooks. He also backed  up his information with reliable research, even though it gets confusing  occasionally between hard science researchers such as those who do MRI and  catscan studies of the brain, and soft science researchers or those who are  in the psychiatric professions. He does the reader a favor by providing  them other places to go if they find a particular part of the brain or the  problems of the brain by quoting these researchers and providing them as  references. On the whole the book is worthwhile, and it is available for my  students and peers to read as a good start in basic neuroscience.

Ms. English has written a very concise and useful book for audiologist and educators. Very few people have been able to link more clearly than she the impact of hearing loss on education and how that hearing loss makes  educational attainment that much more difficult for these children. Not  only does she talk about the responsibilities of audiologists, but also of  parents and educators in making learning more accessible for students who  are deaf or have varying degrees of hearing loss. The book provides  significant background and references which can further the education of  those interested in helping this particular population cease to be at high  risk both in education and other areas, such as medical care. I highly  encourage libraries, teachers of Deaf children, and medical students to be  exposed to this book or to purchase it for their continued use. I am  constantly finding new information in it that I missed in the first reading  and it continues to be one of my primary reference books in my library. She  is both fair and practical, and this certainly is one of the first books of  its kind. Karen L. Sadler,  Science Education, University of Pittsburgh,  klsst23@pitt.edu	2000-05-13

This is the first sign language book I bought for my hearing children. It still is one I take to the schools when I talk to hearing children about what it is like to be Deaf. This book is simple and basic, and years ago tied in with what was taught on Sesame Street. Since I haven't watch the  show in years, I don't know if they teach ASL actively on it anymore. But I  highly recommend this book as a beginning source for children, and for  libraries to have on hand as an introduction to ASL. With the increasing  need for ASL interpreters for the Deaf in court, in medical situations, and  in schools...it is absolutely a priority that children and teenagers be  encouraged to learn ASL as a foreign language.  My terps make 25 -30  dollars an hour, and I've heard it is much more than that in some states  such as California and Texas. Besides, the Deaf always appreciate it when  someone bothers to learn their language for a change. Karen Sadler, Science  Education, University of Pittsburgh, klsst23@pitt.edu	2000-05-03

I have been reading books about human experimentation due to my work in the Deaf community and medical school. Since I am Deaf and many of us who are 'disabled' are concerned about attitudes of others which consider us  less than human or unable to make a worthwhile contribution to the human  race...we often discuss the impact that disability, chronic illness, and  limited education has on the ability to make informed consent, and also the  attitudes of doctors towards us who may be less than whole. Ms. Welsome  totally supported mine and others with disabilities and illnesses fears  that there are those in the military and in the medical fields who feel we  are fair game for any 'experiment' they feel interest in pursuing. It isn't  just the wackos like Kervorkian we have to watch out for, but the  government and the established medical community who in spite of the  Nuremburg Code went ahead and performed and supported experiments which had  no firm basis in medical alleviation of pain or possible exposure. Ms.  Welsome is an exquisite writer and more than deserved the Pulitzer prize.  This book should be required reading for all medical students in medical  ethics classes, and I am certainly recommending it to those in the  Disability rights community so that we can protect our communities from  these fanatics and prevent the Disabled Holocaust from happening again in  the United States.

I actually bought it for my husband, but since I read everything in sight anyway, I picked this up and couldn't put it down again. The history  of Everest and the original attempts to conquer it are very well depicted  and very well researched...which I as a science educator particularly  enjoyed. The book was excellent until the second to the last chapter where  as other readers have noted, in their rush to publish, someone did an  extremely poor job of proofreading. This reflects upon the publishing  company and not on the author. However, as a neuroscientist and an  educator, the mistake made about referring to mitochondria as part of the  blood and capillary system, is inexcusable. The author may not have been  familiar with the anatomy of the human body, but someone should have caught  this mistake. In basic biology classes you learn mitochondria are the  energy making parts of each individual cell. I am still trying to figure  out what exactly the author was referring to, but I immediately went home  and got out my Webster's Medical Dictionary from med school and checked to  make sure this wasn't a mistake of an extra meaning. I am of the opinion  that if Mr. Firstbrook uses English as a second language, he can be excused  for making a mistake with medical terminology...but the publisher should  have seen this and fixed it, especially when it was supported by the BBC.  Otherwise, the book and the pictures were magnificent and I would have  given it a five star rating. Maybe with the next printing they can correct  their mistakes?

Dr. Altman not only wrote a book of significant importance about the need for self-experimentation, and  the history of it...but he wrote it so well that I wanted to know what and  who did the next group of experiments. It also explained a lot of  procedures I learned about in medical school, but sometimes without the  knowledge of the history behind it complete understanding is impossible.  The author also explains quite clearly why we can't use just animals in  experimentation, and gives numerous illustrations of physicians and  scientists who...surprise!...actually think about others compassionately  and are able to put themselves in the shoes of the patients. After  undergoing an experimental cochlear implant which failed (in its early  days), this book makes it a lot easier for me to explain to others why I  undertook such a risk and didn't sue when it failed and made me ill. The  book also makes clear the need for both patient and doctor awareness of  informed consent...for all patients, including those who are disabled or  those who lack a complete education. Dr. Altman wrote a book that should  definitely be required reading by all medical personnel in ethics classes.  Karen L.

Hockenberry doesn't really need more people to tell him how good his book is. However, he does need a person considered to have a disability (Deaf) to tell him--Great JOB!  And to recommend to all those undergoing the  process of learning to deal with a disability and grieving over loss of  abilities, to read this book. It will help significantly. He learned in a  shorter period of time, and had a significantly better outlook on his new  disablement. He also brings up the fact that sometimes the obstacles placed  in our way are of our own making. The Americans with Disabilities Act is  not going to solve all of our problems...and as a country we are lucky to  have it. But many of those problems won't be fixed until we the Deaf and  the disabled get off our collective butts (excuse the pun) and do something  about it. This means becoming active politically and otherwise.  Mr.  Hockenberry needs to write a followup since his career has gone in  different routes now...and we see him more often on television. How has  this newfound fame added or detracted from his life? I didn't always agree  with him...I too have worked with mentally disabled adults, and sometimes  found his attitude shocking, though I think he was merely very young at the  time. But I am recommending this book to my students, to people I work with  who are disabled, to my computer group (the SayWhatClub--we all say 'what')  and anyone else I can think of.

Biddle's book is a nice change of pace from the usual  textbooks on viruses, germs, etc. and is enough to get the kids interested.  It is also very readable, cynical, and caustic which is right up my creek.  He deftly explains our own responsibilities in the cycle of viral  infections world-wide and brings up the fact that we are ignoring the  problems in Third World countries, which will eventually hurt us. Only  suggestion I have is next time include prions and mad cow  disease/Jakob-Crutzfeld/kuru!  Too bad he can't write about politicians  this way...

As a neuroscience student, I took a class on virology that I wasn't required to take. However, since I was working on AIDS and rabies, I decided I needed the background. Between the bad teaching and the horrible  textbook, I ended up taking an audit in the class and came away from it  very confused. This book managed to simply clarify everything that those  supposedly distinquished professors of virology and the writers of the  textbooks for the class couldn't do. Now as a science educator I am always  horrified at how scientists take simple ideas and subjects and make them  difficult for students or laypersons to understand. That isn't the motive  for teaching science or at least shouldn't be. This text on virology is  understandable to everyone, especially if someone like me who is deaf and  therefore has English reading skills that are different from the norm can  comprehend what the author is saying. All I can say to this author is  Bravo, and why aren't you writing more!  Karen L. Sadler, Science  Education, University of Pittsburgh	1999-12-29

This book is a humorous account of theories and belief systems that have been discarded or  disproved through the scientific method. Since science is an ongoing  experience, many things that we believe now will go on to be disproven or  be percieved by future generations as blunders or incredibly naive. It is  good for those interested in science to see that scientists, even good  ones, are not infallible. It is also helpful to realize that it is through  trial and error that correct science understanding and discoveries are  made. Unlike some of the other reviewers, as a scientist and an educator, I  find it ridiculous to expect everyone view scientists as being in a higher  category then everyone else. Students need to understand that mistakes are  made in every field and it is through those mistakes that we learn. My only  complaint about the book is that it was choppy writing which makes it  difficult for learning disabled and those who are deaf or non-native  English readers to read this book. Otherwise this very tongue-in-cheek book  will be where my students can reach it for their own enjoyment of  interesting developments in scientific fields. If mistakes were made, that  is up to me the teacher to point that out or for the student to discover on  their own as they continue to research what interests them.

As a deaf person and an educator who uses her words in my own life and teachings, I feel it is important to know the person I am talking about. I often use Helen Keller  as an example to others with disabilities whom I teach, and this book is a  useful addition to my library. My only reason for giving it a four and not  a five star rating is Dorothy Herrmann speculates quite a bit about the  thoughts and feeling of two women who lived over 75 years ago. Much of  their private lives has been speculated about, but we cannot know the truth  about these matters when they are no longer here to tell us. I also get the  feeling the author is a bit of a Freudian psychologist, and allows this to  influence her writings of the people surrounding Helen and Annie.  Sometimes, innocence is just innocence and there is no need to make it  salacious for the public. Is it so hard to believe that some people are  just innately good? Many of the things that happened to Helen Keller were  typical of the lives of women at that point. I see it in the geneaological  work in my own family. Women didn't have a lot of choices, and women with  disabilities had absolutely none. However, Helen was one of those people  who brought out the best in others, and the protective qualities in men. As  a deaf person who has both men and women for friends who are protective of  me, I can understand teasing in letters which have no negative connotation  of any kind. I am married, but these friends still look out for me. Both my  husband and me understand why they do this and feel this way, and it is  sweet, with nothing in it that has an underlying meaning. I think we can  look at the relationships of Helen with most men that way, rather than  assuming the worst on either side. Otherwise, the book is very well  written, and certainly extremely readable in comparison to other  biographies about Helen Keller.	1999-12-08

This book is a must-read for anyone who might or does work with  the disabled. We no longer want the pity, the institutions, and the  exclusion from society. We want to be viewed as normal except with one part  or a few parts that may not function as some would consider normal. We want  an equal education, equal opportunity to jobs, equal opportunities to  participate in society. And everyone will be the better for it. Mr Shapiro  as a non-disabled person, wrote a book that was compassionate but strived  hard to see things from our point of view. This ability probably stands him  in good stead as a journalist. He even taught me things I didn't know about  other disabilities. Educators, lawyers, politicians, parents, social  workers, and health care professionals need to get off their duff and read  this book. They can no longer turn a blind eye or claim ignorance as an  excuse to not allowing those of us with differences our rights under the  law.	1999-11-06

It is imperative that these students are taught that others with hearing disabilities have succeeded in an area which has normally been  off limits to the deaf. Dr. Lang writes with passion about something he  feels strongly about, and gives wonderful examples of these people who  succeeded in science despite all the odds and barriers against them. Many  scientists and educators will be surprised at the discoveries and work done  by these Deaf scientists, because many of these people may have been  mentioned in other books but it was never advertised that these people had  hearing disabilities. This book should be available in every classroom in  which science is taught, just to show students that if these people could  be successful in the world of science, that they can too in spite of  whatever barriers they face. Science should be for everyone, as Dr. Lang so  ably illustrates.	1999-10-17

With the push for inclusion and placement of deaf  and hard-of-hearing children in public schools, it is more than about time  that someone wrote concerning the need for more intensive training of  interpreters to keep up with the knowledge base and subjects that are  required in school. In a situation where information is received  non-directly from the teacher, if the interpreter doesn't know or  understand the subject, faulty information is given to the student. Yet  when the student makes the mistakes on testing because of misinformation,  it is they who must pay the price. This is not a funny subject, but since  I've been through college with a variety of interpreters with different  abilities, I understand of what Ms. Seal speaks. In a neuroscience medical  class, an interpreter who was hired because he was cheap and had no  certification, misinterpreted the medical term 'olfactory' as 'old  factory'. That was bad enough for an adult, but to give that type of  information to children on which to base continued learning would be a  crime. This book should be read by all those in special education and those  training interpreters throughout the U.S.--it should definitely be required  reading, and I plan to use it in future teaching and recommendations to  science teachers through out the U.S. Karen Sadler University of Pittsburgh	1999-09-24

Geez, and my parents thought I was too much of an activist. Marta Russell writes a thought provoking and scary book on where we 'differently abled' people fit in a capitalist society. She is well-read and writes well,  bringing to her book her passion that in the midst of politics and the  drive to make money, we, the disabled, become easy targets for people like  Kervorkian,who try to convince others that the world is better off without  us. Perhaps the most scary part of the book is the lack of medical ethics  with which many in the medical world view us, and as Ms. Russell supports  with facts that medical journals themselves have found, medical personnel  seem to place meager value on our lives. Since this is a big issue in  medical ethics, as I know from medical school, this book should be required  reading for medical students, nurses, and those in public health. The need  for more active involvement by the disabled in their own care and their own  lives, and the need for political momentum to protect ourselves has been  nicely elucidated by Ms. Russell. Well done. Karen Sadler University of  Pittsburgh	1999-09-24

He raises a lot of questions yet to be investigated about how crucial the  manipulation of the hands are to cognitive learning. It will be interesting  to see the outcome of the questions he's raised both for normal people and  those of us who use manual language over speech, and whether those choices  in means of communication cause the brain to be mapped differently. Dr.  Wilson writes with humor and gives fascinating insights into the worlds of  people whose advocations depend upon their hands. This long neglected part  of our body should now receive the attention it deserves in shaping our  minds.	1999-08-05
