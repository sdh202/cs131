All the furniture by Fischer is just awesome. My favorite was an iridescent pastel chair with a woman's face on it. I enjoyed the bathroom where Entner achieves an awesome texture by using visible brushstrokes and a goldfish pond floorcloth by Dale Wade. I was also very impressed with the Drywall columns painted to look like Italian marble and a garden like octagonal room with lattice work up the walls.<br />Although most of us may not be able to emulate the artistic skill displayed in this book, it is still a great source of ideas and inspiration for anyone interested in incorporating decorative painting into their d&eacute;cor. There is contact information included for all of the artists and photographers represented. I know I will use ideas from this in my own home.	2001-09-05

For each of these themes a set of color schemes including monochromatic, primary, complementary, split-complementary, analogous, spilt, clash and neutral is shown.

The idea of adding salts to you bath to make your own floating tank was fantastic.<br />The pictures are large and informatively captioned.

Some designs are amazingly innovative, like a bed that folds away and coverts into a desk and another that can be either a couch or a set of bunk beds. There is a cradle made of cardboard and crib/cot that can be expanded as a child grows as well.<br />Ranging from whimsical to practical, what all of these designs have in common is creativity and ingenuity.

I love it that the author takes the time to discuss numerous brands of pens, inks and papers instead of just generalizing them.<br />The following section focuses on ink drawing techniques. There is a good discussion of gray tones, parallel lines, value changes, hatching, cross-hatching and patterns.

A very through demonstration of three different ways to make neat corners follows. Next come several unique and interesting projects all created by different artists. Its hard to choose my favorite projects, they are all so awesome. However, I really loved French travelogue made of wood with a hinged cover. The house, a book in a box, is really creative as well.<br />Though this book is great for inspiration, I really feel it is best for someone who has bookbinding experience. Yes, the book does have step-by-step instructions accompanied by demonstrating photos. However, it does no show or describe in detail any of the sewn bindings which could hinder a beginner. For example, it says coptic stitch was used, but did not tell you how to sew the coptic stitch. Also about half the projects are simply altered forms of a base project that was described in more detail. The variations have only a brief paragraph that is just a description, mostly without any real instruction.<br />Unfortunately, there is no list of suppliers. However, I like that contact information for all the contributing artists is listed in the back. This makes a great source of inspiration for any serious bookbinder.	2001-06-12

The impact of the internet is  recognized but there are still many hands-on buying opportunities and the  information here is equally useful in internet shopping. The prices listed  are what are considered to be average dealer retail and do not take into  account the huge premiums that some items have achieved in internet  sales.<br />Thousands of items are listed in nearly 500 pages. The categories  are too numerous to mention in detail but as you would expect, glassware,  pottery and porcelain are extensively covered with many styles and  manufacturers listed. A few highlights are pictured from each category and  the listings are cross-sections of what is available and not intended to be  complete lists of everything ever made. A brief background and sources of  additional information are included for each category. This may include an  expert, collector's club, newsletter or book on the subject.<br />Some of the  other sections I found interesting are advertising character collectibles,  children's books, Beatles &amp; Elvis collectibles, cameras, cookie jars,  dolls, costume jewelry, kitchen items, salt shakers, toys, and yes, even  Barbie dolls and Beanie Babies. Also included are items that are just  attaining collectible status with unknown potential such as calculators and  transistor radios.	2000-07-28

This beautiful item  is shown on the front cover and is a solid piece of furniture that could be  enlarged to be an occasional table with a multitude of uses. A wastepaper  basket and flower pot stand in a similar style are also included.<br />There  are a number of very nice corner and wall shelf patterns with sophisticated  designs including wildlife and a beautiful ballerina.

It liked it that recipes from different areas like Pakistan and  northern Africa are included. There are also 8 exercises for learning to  draw the designs. The best thing about this book, is that it shows more  designs that are on body parts other than hands and feet than other books.<br />If you really want get serious about doing mehndi and want it to be  darker and last longer you need to get fresher paste and probably won't  want to use any in a pre-made tube. However, this is wonderful for those  just getting started or if you just want to experiment without a lot fuss.	2000-07-28

It is packed with creative and inspirational artwork, useful tips, and great techniques for making the sandcastle of your dreams.

Then there are instructions for using and caring for your building tools.  Conveniently, there is also a recipe for making a permanent waterproof  castle. I think this is worth the price of the book alone if you're  interested in making everlasting sand art sculptures and it is also great  for those who don't have access to a beach.

Some  include fluting, piercing, impressing, weaving, making patterns, using a  resist and block printing. Marbling both with and without sizing is also  covered.<br />My favorite section uses the decorated papers for  three-dimensional art. It covers various papier mache methods as well as  how to cover objects such as boxes, tabletops and trays.  It also shows you  how to make lampshades, window shades/blinds, privacy screens, jewelry,  frames, cards, purses and folders.<br />The last section demonstrates  bookbinding techniques for single section, multi-section, soft and  hardcover books.

The kit comes enclosed in a box  and includes a journal, 10 incense sticks &amp; 3 stacks of paper disks. It  is all done in Asian style graphics and colors.<br />The disks include  reminders to take time to enjoy the little things in life with quotes like  &quot;Watch airplanes land&quot; or &quot;Take a garden tour.&quot;  Quotes  such as &quot;Decorate your mailbox&quot; or &quot;Make a painting on an  old window&quot; inspire you to create things. Others, such as &quot;Borrow  a friends coat for a day&quot; or Wear a disguise to the grocery  store&quot; were a little strange and even funny.<br />The journal has  wonderful quotes and though provoking questions on each page. It encourages  you to write down your thoughts about them in the journal to help be more  creative &amp; gain inner spirituality. Questions such as &quot;Do you  allow joy for the sake of joy?&quot; or &quot;What tiny change can you make  for the better today?&quot; help you focus on what's really important in  life. Quotes like &quot;A mind too active is no mind at all&quot; and  &quot;Imagination is more important than knowledge&quot; really force you  to think about how you live your life.  Though I received this as gift and  did enjoy it, I do think it was a bit overpriced for the content.	2000-06-06

I found the artwork here  to have a different tone than the other collage books I own. You won't find  lots of flowers of butterflies here. It tends to be more eclectic or modern  than pretty.  The accompanying captions in combination with a listing in  the back tell the title, size and artist's name as well a bit about the  piece and how it was made. Each of the artist's (most are British)  addresses are listed as well. A glossary, index and a small list of  suppliers are also included.

Book	Books	5	14	14	N	N	The book you need to get more out of Illustrator 8	This is a wonderful book for anyone who wants get more pizzazz out of Illustrator. From just starting out, to obtaining advanced effects, it guides you step-by-step with both text and color examples. Though this book  does a nice job of covering the basics, where it really excels is in its  coverage of advanced techniques. I learned to create painterly effects with  gradient lighting and how to make a complex pattern. It also showed me how  to create a truly realistic reflection, &amp; produce shadows. The tips and  techniques really helped me to learn to use Illustrator more productively.  The resource and artist directories were a nice plus as well. The CD  included is also quite spectacular. It includes some awesome brushes, Wow!  actions and clip art. It also contains images to pick apart and trial  programs. There are even some great tutorials on the basics of Illustrator.	1999-05-21
